(Adds quote, details; updates prices)
 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro slumped broadly on
Monday, as concern increased that Greece will be forced to
restructure its debt and uncertainty over a bailout for
Portugal grew.
 Rising risk aversion generally weighed on the single
currency after Standard & Poor's, while affirming the
'AAA/A-1+' sovereign credit rating on the United States,
revised their outlook on the long-term rating to negative from
stable. For details, see [ID:nN18195555]
 While the dollar fell against the yen hewing to the risk
aversion theme, the impact on the euro was greater because
Europe's problems are already manifest. While U.S. fiscal
tensions are increasing, the U.S. is far from defaulting on its
debt.
 ""The prospect of an actual default by the U.S. on debt
issued in its own currency isn't a realistic worry, in a
financial market that has a lot more real worries to deal with
(including genuine euro zone default risks,)"" said Avery
Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
 ""We are less concerned over a downgrade to the outlook than
we are about the growth implications of turning to fiscal belt
tightening before the economy has self-sustaining momentum.""
 The euro  was last trading down 1.7 percent at
$1.4185, with the session low at $1.4155 -- a two-week low --
according to Reuters data. German government sources said they
expected Greece will not make it through the summer without
debt restructuring though Athens denied a debt rescheduling was
imminent. [ID:nnLDE73H17X]
 The euro's rise has stalled since it hit a 15-month high
last week, though market players expect it to be supported by
prospects of another rise in euro zone interest rates.
 Earlier a Greek newspaper reported that Greece had told the
IMF and the European Union earlier this month that it wants to
restructure its debt, though it pared losses as a finance
ministry source in Athens said the story was untrue.

 Players also are watching Portugal's progress toward a
bailout closely after strong gains in a weekend election by an
anti-euro party in Finland that has vowed to veto its rescue
package. [ID:nLDE73G0I2]
 Analysts doubted the Finnish vote could do more than slow
down a bailout, but the result of the vote added to negative
euro sentiment, encouraging investors to cut long positions.
 NEGATIVE OUTLOOK
 Standard & Poor's cited huge budget deficits and rising
government indebtedness as the reason for the U.S. outlook
revision with the path to addressing those issues not being
clear.
 But ""the dollar is still the safe haven of first and last
resort, said Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon
in New York.
 The last time the U.S. was put on review for a possible
downgrade was in January 1996 after Republicans refused to vote
to increase the debt ceiling, said Kathy Lien, director of
research at GFT in New York. However, this was extremely
short-lived because the outlook was upgraded back to stable in
March after the U.S. government raised the debt ceiling.
 Moody's Investors Service said on Monday, Washington's
debate over its budget is positive despite uncertainty over the
outcome, as it is a potential change in the direction of fiscal
policy but made no changes to its ratings or outlook.
[ID:nNYE003008]
 The euro fell its lowest in almost three weeks against the
yen . It last traded at 116.45, down 2.7 percent.
 Euro/yen fell below a cluster of support in the 119.20 yen
to 119.30 yen area that coincides with some intraday lows hit
earlier in April. A trader for a Japanese bank said the euro
could drop toward 115 yen in the near term.
 The dollar also hit its lowest in almost three weeks
against the yen to around 82.16 yen , before recovering
slightly to 82.34 yen, down 0.9 percent on the day.

 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Worries over Europe's debt
crisis spurred a sell-off in global stocks and the euro
currency on Monday, with a downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook
further battering investor confidence.
 Growing unease about the possibility of Greece
restructuring its debt and the rise of an anti-euro party in
Finland exacerbated anxiety over how European policy-makers
will handle the region's festering debt and bank problems.
 Rating agency Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on the
United States to negative from stable, citing a ""material risk""
that policymakers may not reach agreement on a plan to trim its
large budget deficit. See [ID:nN18195555]
 While the agency maintained the country's top AAA credit
rating, it said the move signals there's at least a
one-in-three chance that it could cut its long-term rating on
the United States within two years.
 ""On a day when sovereign debt troubles have returned to
haunt the euro, S&P's announcement added salt to the wound,""
said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT in New York.
""Investors were risk averse going into the NY open and will now
remain cautious or nervous throughout the North American

 * Banks use tricks to trade out of the official trading band
 * Uncertainty stalls investment, causes panic buying of food
 
 By Olzhas Auyezov
 MINSK, April 18 (Reuters) - Belarus looks to be on the verge
of another devaluation of its currency as it struggles with a
credit crunch and panic buying of key commodities -- both
unintended consequences of attempts to minimise the last one.
 Only three weeks after a 10 percent de facto devaluation,
prompted by a haemorrhaging of the impoverished country's
foreign currency reserves, official efforts to limit its impact
have backfired, further undermining trust in the authorities.
 President Alexander Lukashenko hinted on Saturday that a
devaluation could take place within a few days but it remains to
be seen whether it will bring the rouble's exchange rate to a
fair level and allow normal trading to resume.
 Between the beginning of the year and the devaluation late
last month, the former Soviet republic's foreign currency
reserves fell by a quarter to $3.7 billion due to its vain
efforts to defend the rouble in the face of a mounting current
account deficit.
 On March 29, the central bank allowed the rouble to devalue
by 10 percent but only on an over-the-counter market. It said
currencies should continue to trade at the official rate on the
currency exchange and in retail exchange points.
 The central bank said priority would be given to foreign
currency buy orders from those repaying debt and buying key
goods such as medicines.
 In reality, however, bankers say traders have flooded the
central bank with orders ""backed"" by fake loans, making it all
but impossible to buy dollars, euros or Russian roubles on the
currency exchange.
 Similarly, retail exchange points quickly ran out of
reserves and Belarussians seeking to repay foreign currency
loans or preparing for a trip abroad spent hours in queues
waiting for someone to sell them a handful of dollars.
 The 10 percent devaluation also proved to be not enough to
revive the over-the-counter interbank market.
 ""The (interbank) market is dead,"" said a local banker.
 For those willing to pay 20-30 percent over the official
rate, banks have devised schemes to circumvent the restrictions
such as repeated buying and selling with maximum spread.
 Others sell their counterparts, for example, euros at the
official rate and then perform a euro-dollar trade with them at
a rate that is 30 percent off the market. Since roubles are not
involved, such transactions are not regulated.
 CONSUMERS PANIC
 At the same time, banks are losing customer deposits --
which some people reinvest in gold or durable goods -- and have
nearly halted lending which has led to a credit crunch.
 Mikhail, a taxi driver, said his main job was in
construction but his company, a private business, has not been
able to pay its staff for three months because of a failure to
secure fresh bank loans.
 The dearth of foreign currency and uncertainty about the
exchange rate have hurt trade and investments.
 ""I was going to launch a new plant but I am not sure about
that now,"" said a Minsk-based businessman who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ""It will require some imported raw materials and I
may simply have no currency to buy them.""
 However, officials overseeing state companies that generate
foreign currency revenues have found a new source of power and
profits.
 ""They are enjoying the situation and telling Lukashenko the
system is working fine,"" said the businessman.
 On Saturday, Lukashenko promised to put an end to exchange
rate chaos within ""a few days"". He had earlier said economic
woes were part of the same ""chain"" as a deadly April 11 metro
blast and blamed them on forces seeking to destabilise Belarus.
 Faced with rising prices for both imported and domestically
produced goods -- as the government has dropped a number of
pricing regulations -- ordinary Belarussians this month have
increased panic buying of sugar and sunflower oil.
 Sales of sugar in Minsk reached 300 tonnes, five times the
daily average, on April 12, according to the state news agency
BelTA which said the city government would fine managers of
shops that run out of sugar.

 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday, on increased talk that Greece will be forced to
restructure its debt and uncertainty over a bailout for
Portugal.
 The single currency pared losses after Standard & Poor's,
while affirming the 'AAA/A-1+' sovereign credit rating on the
United States, revised their outlook on the long-term rating to
negative from stable.. However, the overall pressure on the
euro remained intact.

Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital

 NEGATIVE OUTLOOK
 Standard & Poor's cited very large budget deficits and
rising government indebtedness as the reason for the U.S.
ratings downgrade with the path to addressing those issues not
being clear.
""This is just another reason why investors don't want to own
dollars at this point because not only do we have a very
sluggish Federal Reserve and lackluster growth, but one of the
major ratings agencies have put the U.S. on negative watch,""
said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT, New York.
 ""Even though I don't think an actual downgrade would occur,
in this very sensitive or vulnerable time for the U.S. dollar,
it's enough to spook investors from holding or buying U.S.
dollars.""
 Sovereign demand was reported down to $1.4250, while
previous support at the April 6 high of $1.4350 was now seen as
resistance.
 The euro fell more than 1 percent againt the yen to its
lowest in more than two weeks, taking it below its 21-day
moving average. It last traded at 118.25, down 1.4 percent.
 ""The focus is turning towards the Greek situation and is
acting as a dampener on the euro,"" said Mic Ingenuus, currency
strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. ""It would be the first
restructuring and the market has no idea when or whether it

 By Matthias Sobolewski
 BERLIN, April 18 (Reuters) - German government sources said
on Monday Greece will likely restructure its sovereign debt
before the end of summer, putting a time frame to recent
speculation that sent the euro to its lowest in two weeks.
 ""Decisive voices within the federal government expect that
Greece will not make it through the summer without a
restructuring,"" one high-ranking coalition source told Reuters.
 ""That does not mean that the federal government is striving
for (a restructuring) but such a step will probably not be
avoidable,"" he added, echoing views from other coalition
sources.
 The sources did not say what sort of pressure, if any, would
force Greece to change its oft-repeated stance that it would not
seek to restructure its debt. 
 They did not specify the form a restructuring could take.
 The comments sent the euro to its lowest level against the
dollar since April 7, according to Reuters data.
 Athens on Monday reiterated it had no plans to restructure
its debt, a move its central bank chief said would be
catastrophic, but markets continue to speculate that some form
of restructuring is on the cards. [ID:nLDE73H17X]
 The IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission will
examine in June whether Greece has met the prerequisites to
receive the next tranche of its 110 billion euro bailout
package.
 In an interview in Die Welt published last week, German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said ""additional steps""
would need to be taken should the progress report in June
conclude there are doubts about the fiscal sustainability.
 Schaeuble added then, however, that any restructuring would
have to be voluntary if done before 2013. [ID:nLDE73D05J]

16,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2011 08:04AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Fears of end to bank aluminium deals are premature," * Contango wider, benign environment for bank ali deals
 * Real economic strength might prompt cancellations
 * Interest rate rises could be offset by steeper contango
 
 By Pratima Desai
 LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Fears of an end to lucrative
deals that have locked up large swathes of aluminium stocks are
premature because it is likely to take many months for interest
rates to reach levels that make them unprofitable.
 Financing deals are estimated to have tied up a hefty 70
percent of record high aluminium stocks at around 4.6 million
tonnes in London Metal Exchange warehouses.
 ""There is a risk to these deals, but my feeling is interest
rates would have to be significantly higher before we start to
see deals being unwound,"" said Alex Heath, head of base metals
at RBC Capital Markets. 
 ""I don't think that even a 1 percent rise could be enough to
make a material difference ... Given the state of the U.S.
economy, it's unlikely interest rates there will rise quickly.""
 The European Central Bank earlier this month raised
benchmark interest rates for the euro zone to 1.25 from 1.0
percent and because of that traders are starting to worry the
deals could be unwound or not renewed.
 Either could lead to a surge in availability of aluminium,
used widely in transport, construction and packaging.
 ""The ECB rise is not an isolated incident, there will be
other rises. As borrowing costs go up, inevitably a mountain of
aluminium will be released,"" a trader said, adding financing
deals have mostly been done in dollars and euros.
 Fastmarkets analyst Will Adams has said he expects prices to
move lower in the next month on concerns that financing deals
will unwind. ""It might start to unnerve the market,"" he said.
 But in the United States, forecasts are for the Federal
Reserve to leave benchmark interest rates at near zero for the
rest of this year, despite predictions of rising inflation.
 ""Central bankers are not being aggressive on interest rates,
they are being extremely cautious. It looks like a fairly benign
environment for aluminium financing deals,"" said Dan Brebner,
analyst at Deutsche Bank.
 
 SIGNIFICANT CONTANGO
 Aluminium has been a top performer this year partly because
of these deals, which kept material away from the market.
Benchmark aluminium on the London Metal Exchange touched $2,720
a tonne on April 11, its highest since August 2008.
 ""For banks, these deals are the best option among a pool of
poor options as far as investing money goes,"" said Justin
Lennon, analyst at Mitsui Bussan commodities. ""We will only see
them cancelled when we see real economic strength and higher
margins for employing the money elsewhere.""
 A typical deal consists of buying nearby aluminium from a
producer, selling it forward at a profit and striking a deal to
store it cheaply for an extended time period. The difference
between the nearby and forward price is known as the contango.
 ""There's a pretty significant contango for aluminium, an
important aspect that will enable these structures to remain in
place,"" Deutsche's Brebner said.
 To illustrate, the contango or discount for the LME's
three-month contract against the December 2012 contract is now
more than $100 a tonne compared with $80 a tonne at the end of
January. The discount for the cash contract against the December
2012 contract is $121 from $87.
 It has widened in recent weeks because of surging prices of
power, which on average account for about 35 percent of
aluminium smelting costs.
 ""Interest rates are a risk, but it depends on whether they
can be offset by the contango increasing by the same amount,""
said Gayle Berry, analyst at Barclays Capital.
 ""It would depend on a deal-by-deal basis, but on the whole
you could probably stomach a bit of an increase in interest
rates without seeing financing deals coming under pressure.""
 If the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve were to
embark on an aggressive tightening cycle then nearby prices
could tumble, widen the contango and potentially reinforce the
profitability of bank aluminium deals.
 ""Expectations for growth would plummet, expectations for
metals demand growth and prices would follow. The contango would
probably widen,"" Brebner said.

 * Rebels need oil sales for state salaries, war effort 
 * Oil chief says likely to step down if Gaddafi falls 
 
 By Alexander Dziadosz
 BENGHAZI, Libya, April 18 (Reuters) - Libyan rebels are
unlikely to export any more oil until they are able to resume
production but are keeping in touch with potential buyers, an
oil official in the opposition-held east said on Monday.
 The rebels control fields owned by the Arabian Gulf Oil
Company (Agoco), including Nafoora, Misla and Sarir, which have
a combined potential production capacity of about 400,000
barrels per day, Wahid Bugaighis told Reuters in an interview.
 ""We still have contacts with potential buyers, but naturally
nothing materialises right now until we know what the situation
is and when we will be back on stream,"" said Bugaighis, who was
appointed head of the National Oil Company, set up by the
Benghazi-based rebel national council to sell oil produced in
rebel-held areas.
 Qatar, which is marketing the rebels' crude, said last week
it had facilitated the sale of 1 million barrels of oil this
month as well as arranged the shipment of four cargoes of fuel
to Benghazi and was ready to support further transactions.
 Rebels had to shut down oil production after forces loyal to
Muammar Gaddafi attacked Agoco's Misla field in early April,
damaging its power generation system, an oil tank, some smaller
diesel tanks and other equipment, Bugaighis said.
 He said he hoped production would resume in ""a few weeks"",
but this depended on security, the extent of the damage and
other factors.
 Mixed signals on who is in charge of east Libya's energy
industry has made it harder to form a clear picture on rebel oil
policy.
 An Agoco official contacted by Reuters said the firm was not
giving a timeline on resuming production and was still operating
independently of Bugaighis by dealing directly with the national
council.
 Bugaighis said rebels were securing the fields under their
control but were not working on getting any of the fields apart
from Agoco's pumping again for now.
 ""They are secured, but, you know, look at a map and look at
the enormity of the desert and the tiny spots of oil fields. You
really would need almost an army to fully secure them,"" he said.
 ""But we are satisfied with the security we have right now,
at least in terms of protecting essential infrastructure and our
people,"" he added.
 NEW POLICY
 Bugaighis said rebels were still in contact with potential
buyers, both those who had purchased oil from Libya before and
possible first-time customers.
 ""Some people are keeping their options open,"" he said,
declining to name any specific possible buyers.
 The Libyan opposition is eager to resume oil production so
it can pay salaries and meet other expenses as it tries to oust
Gaddafi, who is fielding better-armed and trained troops against
rebels on the road between Ajdabiyah and Brega.
 If they do manage to oust Gaddafi, Bugaighis said Libya's
new leadership would try to root out corruption in the oil
industry and might reconsider some of the Gaddafi government's
production policies.
 ""The policy from the inception of the Gaddafi regime, or say
about three or four years into it ... their objective was always
produce, produce the maximum, regardless of whether it was
sustainable or not. This is what we want to reconsider,"" he
said.
 But Bugaighis, 74, said he did not expect to stay head of
the National Oil Company if Gaddafi is ousted. He said his
current role was mostly to make sure operations in the east get
back on stream as soon as possible and help market any oil
exports.
 ""When things are stabilised, there are certainly more
capable people than me, and younger people, to take over,"" he
said.

 It is expected that they will begin offering services for

 SOUTH KOREA 
 South Korea's Financial Services Commission has set up a

clearing house by the end of 2012. 
 Industry experts expect the country to go down the
""national champion"" route of establishing a domestically run
house - as opposed to using one of the international operators.

 They expect clearing requirements to focus initially on the
domestic Korean won swaps market.

must be centrally cleared. [ID:nTOE64B07O] 
 The bill, which is due to be implemented by the end of
2012, said the mandatory clearing services can be provided by

Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) offers trade settlement
services on OTC trades in foreign exchange derivatives and most
interest rate swaps. 
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said it will move to
set clearing requirements for these trades but has expressed
concern about too much risk being concentrated in a single
clearing house. 
 The RBI has also said credit default swaps, which are due

20,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2011 06:12AM ET</span>","Ireland vows no ""mayhem"" in diplomatic offensive"," * New govt planning overseas drive to restore credibility
 * Moody's downgrades Irish banks after sovereign cut
 * Irish govt considering 2 bln euros of asset sales
 
 DUBLIN/LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Ireland kickstarted a
diplomatic offensive to restore its credibility on international
markets on Monday with a pledge to avoid any action that would
further rattle euro zone debt markets.
 Talk of a Greek restructuring, denied by the country's
finance minister, has put investors on edge and Prime Minister
Enda Kenny balked at a suggestion that Dublin could use the
threat of default to extract concessions from European partners.
 ""We have no intention of causing mayhem here,"" Kenny told
BBC radio.
 The former primary schoolteacher, propelled to power in
February, is in London for talks with British Prime Minister
David Cameron as part of a drive to highlight recent progress in
tackling Ireland's financIal crisis.
 Investors have given a cautious thumbs-up to government
efforts to deal with the country's banks, at the root of the
crisis, with tough stress tests, a radical restructuring and a
pledge to recapitalise them by a further 24 billion euros.
 But concerns a Greek restructuring could trigger contagion
coupled with Ireland's spluttering growth prospects have undone
much of the positive sentiment.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish paper
over benchmark German Bunds is currently around 653 euros, some
58 basis points wider than a near two-month low of 595 bps hit
earlier this month.
 Moody's rating agency downgraded Ireland's
government-guaranteed banks by two notches on Monday following a
sovereign downgrade last week, meaning that all the lenders are
now classified as junk.
 
 ASSET SALES
 Investors are concerned Ireland's economy will not be able
to grow fast enough to sustain its debt burden since the
International Monetary Fund and European Union arranged an 85
billion euro ($123 billion) bailout last year.
 Greece, whose debt burden is expected to approach 160
percent of annual output by 2013, has laid out plans to sell
stakes in key state firms to quell debt worries.
 Kenny said his government was considering which of Ireland's
state assets will be sold to raise around 2 billion euros. A
report by University College Dublin economics professor Colm
McCarthy outlined five billion euros worth of proposed sales.
 ""The government will consider Colm McCarthy's report and we
will make decisions in respect of what's feasible and what's not
feasible,"" he told Irish state broadcaster RTE.
 Ireland's new coalition administration has vowed to restore
the country's international reputation after the humiliation of
an EU-IMF bailout and a slew of financial scandals.
 Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore is meeting European
Union ambassadors in Dublin on Monday to update them on the
government's economic plans.
 Ireland's own ambassadors are being recalled in the next few
months for briefings on how to promote the country overseas.
 Kenny will make a speech to British investors in the City of
London later on Monday and said the trip would be followed up
with a visit to New York in a couple of weeks.
 ""I will be spelling out the message that we are not the same
as we were. We are in a very different place now.""

 * Deposits hold an estimated 2.3 trl cubic metres of gas
 * Gazprom not to participate in tender 
 
 MOSCOW, April 18 (Reuters) - Novatek, Russia's No. 2 gas
producer, will participate in an auction for four Arctic gas and
condensate deposits with an estimated 2.3 trillion cubic metres
of gas, double that of the company's reserve base.
 ""We submitted our tender applications for the four Yamal
deposits to the Subsoil Agency on Friday,"" a source in Novatek
told Reuters on Monday.
 ""Our goal has always been to grow our reserve base, and this
tender could lead to a significant increase,"" he said.
 A source familiar with top gas producer Gazprom's licensing
operations confirmed media reports that Gazprom did not apply to
tender for the deposits.
 The four deposits are in the same remote Arctic Yamal-Nenets
region where the company's main reserve base of 1.144 trillion
cubic metres of natural gas and 73 million tonnes of condensate
is located.
 Novatek has earmarked some of deposits to supply a $20
billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which it plans to
start building on the region's peninsula in 2012. By 2015
Novatek expects to produce 16 million tonnes of the cooled gas
per year.
 Russia media have reported that investment group Summa
Capital and independent producer Itera also submitted
applications to participate in the tender but only for the
smallest of the four fields. Neither company was available for
immediate comment.
 Without Gazprom in the running, analysts say Novatek is most
likely win the licences, thereby tripling its reserve base.
 ""With Russia's gas giant not participating in the auction,
we believe that Novatek has an excellent chance of receiving all
four blocks, as it is miles ahead of its LNG project competitors
and is apparently the only bidder for all four blocks being
auctioned,"" UniCredit Bank said in a research note.
 May 20 is the deadline for auction participants to submit
down payments for the licences, and for all four deposits
Novatek will have to pay around 6.8 billion roubles ($241
million).
 ""We do not expect significant competition during this
bidding process, so we believe this amount will be close to the
final payment due,"" UniCredit said.
 The largest of the four deposits, the Sever-Obsky field,
holds an estimated 1.2 trillion cubic metres of natural gas,
including both proven and probable reserves, and 218.5 million
tonnes of condensate.
 The second-largest deposit, the Salmanovsky field, has 482.8
billion cubic metres (bcm) of proven gas reserves, 284.3 bcm of
probably reserves, and 17 million tonnes of proven condensate.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro sank on Monday and
European stocks fell into the red for the year as the rise of a
euro-sceptic party in Finland and growing unease about Greek
debt battered investor sentiment in the single currency zone.
 Equities were also weaker on disappointing European earnings
and concerns about Japan's coming reporting season, and Wall
Street looked set for losses.
 Gold and silver hit new record highs on inflation fears.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> started
what is in many places a holiday-shortened week trading down
more than half a percent, led by Europe, where the FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> was off 1 percent.
 The fall wiped out the European index's gains this year,
leaving it in negative territory for 2011.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> earlier closed down 0.36 percent.
 In a weekend election, Finnish voters handed the anti-euro
True Finns party a crucial role in parliament and possibly a
path into government.

requests for bailout funds, meaning it could in theory hold up
costly plans to shore up Portugal and bring stability to debt

 Talk about Greek debt restructuring has also boiled up in
recent weeks, including a Greek newspaper report on Monday that
the government had asked the International Monetary Fund and
European Union to start discussions on a restructuring.
 A Greek finance ministry source said the report was not
true. [ID:nATH006025] [ID:nLDE73H0DR]
 Equities were also being hurt by an increasing concern that
the current earnings season is not going to be as good as recent
quarters.
 ""Company results haven't been that great and there are
concerns that margins for a lot of companies are not going to
rise. The bias for the market is more on the downside. There are
a lot of risks and you may get a serious knock,"" said Koen De
Leus, strategist at KBC Securities in Brussels.
 Dutch consumer electronics major Philips Electronics
 posted lower than expected first-quarter net profit and
said it would divest its struggling television business.

 Citigroup Inc  is expected to report a drop in
quarterly profit and revenue later, as an uncertain trading
environment and weak consumer loan demand hinder its efforts to
move past the financial crisis. [ID:nN17260604]

WEAKER EURO
 The euro hit a 10-day low against the dollar on concerns
about Greek restructuring and the Portuguese bailout.
 It fell 0.9 percent to $1.4305 
 ""The focus is turning towards the Greek situation and is
acting as a dampener on the euro -- it would be the first
restructuring and the market has no idea when or whether it will
happen,"" said Mic Ingenuus, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.
 Analysts were sceptical the Finnish vote could derail the
Portugal's bailout but it added to already negative sentiment.
 On bond markets, Portuguese, Spanish and other lower-rated
euro zone government debt came under pressure.
 Greece's five-year credit default swaps -- the cost of
insuring against default -- rose 84 basis points on the day to a
new record high of 1,220 basis points, also dragging peripheral
peers with them.

 HONG KONG, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro weakened on a broad
wave of profit-taking on Monday though could rebound later in
the day, while stocks in Asia ex-Japan remained flat, with
investors unconvinced that China's latest moves to cool its
economy would hurt the global recovery. 
 A raft of news about Europe's tenuous debt situation,
including Finland's anti-euro party making big gains in a
parliamentary election on Sunday and talk of a Greek debt
restructuring, gave cover to traders hoping to take profits
after the euro rose above $1.4500. [ID:nLDE73G02L]	
 ""This probably mostly has to do with market sentiment. In
the end, I think what it probably boils down to is that there
are still some long positions in the euro,"" said Koji Fukaya,
director of global foreign exchange research for Credit Suisse
Securities in Tokyo, referring to the euro's drop.	
 But the common currency is expected to be supported by
prospects of another interest rate hike after the recent quarter
point increase, as data showed euro zone inflation climbed
higher than expected in March. [ID:nLDE73E12U]	
 In contrast, the Fed is expected to continue with its ultra
easy policy stance, encouraging investors to search for
high-yielding currencies, especially in Asia, where authorities
are still battling inflationary pressures. 
 China on Sunday raised banks' reserve requirements for the
fourth time this year. The move was not a surprise as market
players had predicted more tightening after last week's data
showed an acceleration in inflation. [ID:nL3E7FH05Y].	
 Beijing's latest policy action is a sign that authorities
across the region are intensifying their battle, using interest
rate increases and strengthening currencies, to rein in imported
inflation due to rising commodity prices.	
 Singapore sanctioned an increase in the value of its
currency last week while the Bank of Thailand is likely to raise
interest rates at a review on Wednesday.	
 In a sign that Beijing's latest action was well anticipated,
both Chinese and Hong Kong stocks were trading
higher on the day after opening lower.	
 
 GOOD PERFORMER	
 Shanghai has been the best performing stock market so far
this year with gains of about 9 percent as authorities have
repeatedly raised reserve requirements and increased rates. In
contrast, India's troubles in tackling inflation have 
seen that market decline by 4.5 percent on a year-to-date
basis.	
 Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei dipped, weighed by
declines in telecommunications shares. Outside Japan, MSCI's
index of Asia Pacific shares remained mostly
flat. Korean shares hit another record high before
ending lower.	
 With stronger currencies being used as a weapon to tackle
inflation, investors are adding exposure to the Chinese yuan
and the Singapore dollar and have turned bullish
on the South Korean won's outlook .	
 PIMCO, the world's biggest bond fund manager, said the yuan
and the won are ""fundamentally undervalued"". [ID:nL3E7FI03R]	
 
 GOLD HITS FRESH RECORD	
 In commodities, gold rose to yet another record high,
building on four consecutive weeks of gains, powered by rising
inflation pressures and a weakening dollar. Holdings in the SPDR
Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed
exchange-traded fund, rose too. [ID:nL3E7FI013]	
 London copper prices dropped half a percent while
Shanghai copper prices  also dipped slightly after
Beijing's latest round of tightening before drifting higher.	
 ""LME prices are basically still in their rangebound trading
pattern and that will continue this week,"" said Judy Zhu, a
commodity analyst at Standard Chartered Bank. 
 U.S. crude futures  slipped below $109 a barrel as
traders took profits after three days of gains despite a crude
oil production cut by Saudi Arabia. Prices have retreated
slightly after hitting a 2-1/2 year peak of $113.46 earlier this
month. [ID:nLDE73G0AA] 
 Notwithstanding the commodities rally, U.S.

 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, April 18 (Reuters) - The euro extended
losses on Monday after repeated attempts to break above a
resistance level failed, placing focus on renewed worries about
euro zone debt problems and giving the dollar a much needed
reprieve after heavy selling in the past few weeks.	
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.4377 after another
try at rising clearly above $1.45 failed on Friday and as
markets grew uneasy after Finnish voters handed the anti-euro
True Finns party a crucial role in parliament and possibly into
government.	
 The euro hit its lowest in more than two weeks against the
yen at 118.94 yen on trading platform EBS and was last down 0.7

 The data also shows that speculators increased their short
position in the yen to the biggest in nearly a year. 
 The yen rose broadly, at one point hitting its highest in
more than two weeks against both the dollar and the euro.	
 The dollar fell to two-week lows below 82.95 yen, and was
last down 0.3 percent at 82.88 yen .	
 
 EURO FALTERS AFTER RALLY 
 The euro's rise has stalled since it hit a 15-month high of
$1.4521 on trading platform EBS last week, and a trader for a
Japanese bank in Tokyo said the euro could face more
profit-taking ahead of Easter holidays late this week. 
 The euro's failure to hold above $1.45 suggests that a
bigger near-term pullback may be in store. Earlier, the euro
briefly dipped below support near $1.4365, right around the
conversion line on the daily Ichimoku chart, a form of Japanese
technical analysis widely used among market players.	
 A clear break of that level and the April 6 intraday high of
$1.4350 could open the way toward a deeper drop. Possible
downside targets include $1.4263, the 23.6 percent retracement
of the euro's February to April rally, and $1.4104, the 38.2
percent retracement of the same move.	
 Euro/yen fell below a cluster of support in the 119.20 yen
to 119.30 yen area that coincides with some intraday lows hit
earlier in April. The trader for a Japanese bank said the euro
could drop towards 115 yen in the near-term. 
 Not all are convinced the euro will head that low, however.
Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore, said falls in euro/yen
and yen crosses may turn out to be limited.	
 ""There were some stops and a try for the downside, but there
is not much reason for the market to head toward a risk-off type
of move so I personally think we could see a bit of a rebound,""
Okagawa said about cross/yen pairs.	
 The yen had slid broadly in the wake of joint-yen selling
intervention by the Group of Seven industrialised nations on
March 18, before regaining some ground last week. 
 That joint intervention and a decline in volatility had put
renewed focus back on interest rate differentials and the appeal
of carry trades -- a tactic of selling low-yielding currencies
to fund investment in currencies with higher yields.	
 The yen fell to 2-1/2 year lows against the Australian
dollar, an 11-month low on the euro and a six-month trough
versus the dollar earlier in April. The yen fell on market
expectations that the Bank of Japan was likely to lag behind
other central banks in rising interest rates, especially when
considering the economic impact from a massive earthquake and
tsunami that devastated Japan's northeast on March 11. 
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 74.997 , after having touched a 16-month low
of 74.617 last Thursday.	
 The New Zealand dollar took a hit from slightly
softer-than-expected New Zealand inflation data that was seen as
reducing chances of an early resumption of interest rate rises,
and fell
0.6 percent to $0.7945 . [ID:nL3E7FF01F].

37,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2011 01:52AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-France flirts with ""Euro-protectionism"""," * Political debate turns to protectionism in election year
 * Socialists want tariffs linked to labour, climate rules
 * Scant European support for protectionism
 
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, April 18 (Reuters) - An old French idea is blossoming
again in the Paris springtime.
 France's Socialists have just embraced a form of European
trade protectionism in their manifesto, a shift from their
previous endorsement of globalisation as a win-win proposition
for French workers.
 The shift matters both because the Socialists and their
Green allies have a good chance of unseating centre-right
President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's election, and because
France has a way of setting the political agenda in Europe.
 ""Europe is the only continent that imposes free trade on
itself in a world that is constantly making exceptions,"" the
programme adopted by the Socialist party on April 9 said.
 Declaring that Europe should be neither a fortress nor a
sieve, the Socialists want international labour, environmental
and health and safety standards built into world trade rules.
 Failing that, ""we will propose putting in place tariff locks
at Europe's borders"" until exporting countries adopt norms
applied in Europe to issues such as trade union rights, child
labour and carbon emissions.
 Furthermore, the Socialists want the European Union to
insert tougher ""fair trade"" safeguard clauses in agreements with
third countries, enabling the EU to reimpose tariffs to halt any
import surge threatening European industry.
 And they demand that the executive European Commission
publish a study assessing the impact of each new trade agreement
on European industry and employment before it is signed.
 The Socialists' U-turn on trade is largely driven by
domestic politics, and while it resembles positions taken by the
U.S. Democratic Party, it has little support so far in other
European countries, except perhaps Italy.
 It is an attempt to win back the ""losers of globalisation""
-- the unemployed, remnants of the industrial working class and
middle-class voters who fear their living standards are falling.
 Some of these voters are defecting to the far-right National
Front under new leader Marine Le Pen, who has made inroads by
attacking immigration and Islam but also advocating dumping the
euro and re-erecting customs barriers at France's borders.
 On the hard left, Communists, Trotskyists and the Left Party
siphon off up to 15 percent of the vote with anti-globalisation
rhetoric.
 The ecologist Greens also see themselves as part of the
""altermondialiste"" movement, a French term that implies they
favour some alternative model of globalisation, but not the
existing one.
 In fact, free trade has little political constituency in
France. While the seafaring British and Dutch have long been
free traders, the French boast a protectionist tradition
reaching back at least to the 17th century mercantilist
Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's finance minister.
 More recently, Maurice Allais, one of France's rare Nobel
economics prizewinners, published diatribes against free trade
with emerging economies until his death last year, warning that
it would cause mass unemployment and depression in Europe.
 Another contrarian intellectual, demographer Emmanuel Todd,
is campaigning for European protectionism -- and an exit from
the euro -- saying the loss of jobs will otherwise tear apart
the fabric of French society.
 Yet Europe has few natural resources and relies for its
prosperity on exporting high added-value goods and services. The
rising middle classes of China and India want to drive German
cars, wear French or Italian fashions and fly European planes.
 European tariffs might perpetuate yesterday's industrial
jobs at the expense of tomorrow's knowledge economy. And Asian
nations would almost certainly retaliate if Europe started
closing its markets because their wage bargaining or carbon
emissions were not up to scratch.
 However, French trade unions and businesses seek protection
when offshoring, outsourcing, cheap imports or a strong euro
threaten jobs, while world-leading French companies may be
reluctant to advertise the benefits of globalisation for fear of
attracting confiscatory taxation at home.
 The interests of producers have long outweighed those of
consumers in France, where an influential farmers' lobby is a
bedrock of support for Sarkozy's Gaullist UMP party.
 The president himself has flirted with the language of
European protectionism, branding EU trade policy ""naive"" and
calling for a ""Community preference"" in trade. But he has done
little about it in practice since he took office in 2007.
 With no political mileage in free trade, he spurned calls to
make concluding the World Trade Organisation's long-stalled Doha
round of negotiations a priority of France's presidency of the
G20 group of major economies this year.
 While the French public discourse is clearly set to turn
more protectionist in the run-up to next April's presidential
election, there are good grounds for putting your fingers in
your ears and waiting for it to blow over.
 For one thing, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the frontrunner to be
Socialist candidate, is no protectionist. As head of the
International Monetary Fund, he has resisted pressure to roll
back globalisation since the onset of the global financial
crisis in 2008.
 Secondly, trade policy is anchored in EU treaties and run by
the European Commission, which is firmly in the free-trade camp,
although it is more concerned than in the past to win reciprocal
market access from trading partners.
 And thirdly, the French drift towards protectionism has no
support in Germany, Paris' vital partner in EU leadership.
 ""For the Social Democratic Party, this would be considered
sheer madness,"" says Ernst Hillbrand of the Friedrich Ebert
Foundation, a think tank close to Germany's opposition SPD.
 Some Germans fret about EU rules that allow cheap contract
labour from new member states in eastern Europe to work in
Germany, undercutting union-negotiated wages.
 ""But the general mood among the German population is still
that we are benefiting more from globalisation than we are
losing out,"" he said, quoting a German industrialist as saying:
""China will become the factory of the world, but we will build
that factory.""

 WASHINGTON, April 18 (Reuters) - Russia wants to finish
negotiations for a loan to cash-strapped Belarus within a
month, offering conditions similar to those typical of an
International Monetary Fund programme, Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin said over the weekend.
 ""I would like to finish it all within a month,"" Kudrin told
journalists on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank spring
meetings in Washington.
 ""But it all depends on whether there are difficulties with
questions that we are dealing with right now,"" he said, without
elaborating.
 Belarus is seeking a $1 billion loan from Moscow and $1.7
billion from a Russia-led regional bailout fund as it is
running out of foreign-currency reserves due to a big trade
deficit and overspending in the run-up to the December 2010
presidential election.
 Russia has asked Belarus to submit a credible plan for
economic stabilization, and Kudrin said Moscow would like to
issue the loan on terms similar to those typical for IMF
standby programmes.
 ""I think that those proposals and the criteria that we will
stick to will ... in my opinion, 80 percent, meet the
requirements of the IMF,"" Kudrin said.
 He would not reveal further details.

potentially higher anti-dumping duties on potato starch imported
from the European Union, the commerce ministry said on Monday,
finalising a mid-term review of a 5-year tariff launched in
2007.	
 The commerce ministry has decided to levy final anti-dumping
duties at a range between 12.6 to 56.7 percent, a jump in the
upper limit of previous levels set at 17 to 35 percent, the
ministry said on its website (www.mofcom.gov.cn).	
 The adjustments in the tariff came after a number of
domestic enterprises requested the re-examination of tax rates
as European firms had increased the dumping of potato starch
products since the second half of 2008, the ministry added.	
 Last August, the ministry launched an investigation into
whether to impose separate countervailing duties on potato
starch imports from the EU by examining the size of subsidies to
European firms. It said those findings will likely come by
August.	
 The number of anti-dumping and countervailing cases
initiated by China against other countries and vice-versa is
rising, a sign of increasing trade friction following the global
financial crisis.	
 The Doha round of talks at the World Trade Organization,
launched in 2001 with the aim of reducing poverty by cutting
global trade barriers, is at risk of fizzling as WTO members
remain divided on how to open their markets to foreign goods.
[IDn:N15283158]	
 Last week, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said
there was ""no reason to be optimistic"" about the chances of
success in the Doha talks, instead hinting at the alternative of
more bilateral and regional free trade deals.	
 Many of China's trade partners, including the United States
and the EU, would also like to see faster appreciation of the
yuan, saying an undervalued currency gives Chinese exporters an
unfair competitive edge.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, April 18 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Monday
as investors bet that China's latest round of policy tightening
won't dent prospects of a global economic recovery while the
euro weakened on a broad wave of profit-taking.	
 China on Sunday raised banks' reserve requirements for the
fourth time this year. The move was not a surprise as market
players had predicted more tightening after last week's data
showed an acceleration in inflation. [ID:nL3E7FH05Y].	
 Beijing's latest policy action is a sign that authorities
across the region are intensifying their battle, using interest
rate increases and strengthening currencies, to rein in imported
inflation due to rising commodity prices.	
 Singapore sanctioned an increase in the value of its
currency last week while the Bank of Thailand is likely to raise
interest rates at a review on Wednesday.	
 In a sign that Beijing's latest action was well anticipated,
both Chinese and Hong Kong stocks were trading
higher on the day after opening lower.	
 
 
 
 GOOD PERFORMER	
 Shanghai has been the best performing stock market so far
this year with gains of about 9 percent as authorities have
repeatedly raised reserve requirements and increased rates. In
contrast, India's troubles in tackling inflation have 
seen that market decline by 5.5 percent on a year-to-date
basis.	
 Elsehwere, Japan's Nikkei dipped, weighed by
declines in telecommunications shares. Outside Japan, MSCI's
index of Asia Pacific shares edged higher.
Korean shares hit another record high.	
 With stronger currencies being used as a weapon to tackle
inflation, investors are adding exposure to the Chinese yuan
and the Singapore dollar and have turned bullish
on the South Korean won's outlook .	
 PIMCO, the world's biggest bond fund manager, said the yuan
and the won are ""fundamentally undervalued"". [ID:nL3E7FI03R]	
 
 EURO WEAKENS	
 The euro suffered broad losses as a raft of bad news in the
form of Finland's anti-euro party making big gains in a
parliamentary election on Sunday and talk of a Greek debt
restructuring prompted traders to take profits into a recent
rally. [ID:nLDE73G02L]	
 ""This probably mostly has to do with market sentiment. In
the end, I think what it probably boils down to is that there
are still some long positions in the euro,"" said Koji Fukaya,
director of global foreign exchange research for Credit Suisse
Securities in Tokyo, referring to the euro's drop.	
 But the common currency is expected to be supported by
prospects of another interest rate hike after the recent quarter
point increase, as data showed euro zone inflation climbed
higher than expected in March. [ID:nLDE73E12U]	
 In contrast, the Fed is expected to continue with its ultra
easy policy stance, encouraging investors to search for
high-yielding currencies elswhere. 
 In commodities, gold rose to yet another record high,
building on four consecutive weeks of gains, powered by rising
inflation pressures and a weakening dollar. Holdings in the SPDR
Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed
exchange-traded fund, rose too. [ID:nL3E7FI013]	
 U.S. crude futures  headed lower towards $109 a barrel
as traders took profits after three days of gains despite
comments by Saudi Arabia confirming a cut in crude production to
counter an oversupplied market. Prices have retreated slightly
after hitting a 2-1/2 year peak of $113.46 earlier this month.	
 London copper prices briefly dropped half
a percent while Shanghai copper prices  also dipped
slightly after Beijing's latest round of tightening.	
 Notwithstanding the commodities rally, U.S.
Treasury yields declined as recent data showed underlying U.S.
inflation pressures remained subdued. Ten-year yields
edged a basis point lower to 3.40 percent after
falling 9 basis points on Friday.

 GREATER NOIDA, India, April 18 (Reuters) - India's rise as
an emerging market star with seemingly insatiable demand means
firms such as South Korea's LG Electronics are doing a booming
business, but the country must rev up its manufacturing sector
further or risk an unmanageable trade gap and a slowdown in its
blistering growth.	
 The sector has started to catch up with India's world-famous
IT and services industry to sate demand for anything from cars
to air-conditioners to flat-screen TVs in the homes of hundreds
of millions of newly affluent Indians who are ready to splurge.	
 The potential is vast for the likes of LG , which
plans to double its India revenue in just four years pumping out
appliances every few seconds at its factory outside New Delhi,
products that were seen as rare luxuries before economic
liberalisation. 
 But creaky infrastructure, erratic policies and a shortage
of skilled labour mean factory growth has yet to emerge from the
shadows of neighbouring China's prowess. 
 Manufacturing makes up about a third of China's gross
domestic product (GDP) compared to a 16 percent share in India,
the same as it was 20 years ago. New Delhi has set an ambitious
target to raise that figure to 25 percent in a decade.	
 ""Manufacturers are becoming optimistic, but my feeling is
that a huge level of manufacturing coming to India has still too
many challenges,"" said LG's Chief Operating Officer Yasho Verma.	
 ""This type of factory is OK. But if suppose LG decides
tomorrow it should have 20 factories in India, then it's a major
problem,"" he said in an interview at LG's plant.	
 The trade ministry has raised ""serious concern"" that the
current account deficit may become unsustainable as India's
trade deficit is set to balloon to $278.5 billion by 2014, a
twenty-fold increase over a decade from the $14.3 billion in
2004.	
 ""A large widening of the trade deficit can potentially
result in payments difficulties,"" it said in a recent strategy
document. ""Such a situation is simply unacceptable because it
may jeopardize the entire growth process.""	
 India can no longer rely on a mix of its IT and service
sector heft, remittances from its citizens working overseas and
capital flows to finance a huge import bill of one of the
world's fastest growing economies. 
 Manufacturing may need to plug the gap and provide jobs for
the tens of millions expected to enter the workforce in the next
decade who cannot be absorbed in farming or IT and services.	
 ""If India is to achieve its stated goals on GDP growth and
more importantly, to generate higher levels of employment for
the growing young population, India's manufacturing sector has
to enter into a new orbit of even higher growth,"" said a report
by the Boston Consulting Group, which suggested India's
manufacturing sector should aim to grow an annual 11 percent.	
 ""If India has to target a high growth of 11 percent for its
manufacturing sector over next 15 years, it needs to necessarily
focus on growing its exports much faster,"" it said.	
 The government in February estimated manufacturing growth in
the 2010/2011 fiscal year at 8.8 percent. 


 
 NOT PERFECT, BUT GETTING BETTER	
 Reuters spoke to four executives from manufacturing firms
who have set up shop in India. The consensus was that, while
things aren't perfect, they're improving rapidly and India is
starting to shed its tag as a manufacturing laggard.	
 A maturing supplier base, the influx of seasoned global
firms and an explosion in demand have brought transformation
even in the last couple of years to a sector infamous for its
red tape, countless licence requirements and pitiful output
before liberalisation began in 1991.	
 ""I've been here living in the country for 18 months, I've
been coming here for 10 years, and I can tell you in the 18
months I've seen a huge difference,"" said John Flannery, the
India chief executive of General Electric Co .	
 ""The things that we would ask or expect of our supply chain
today are quite different than what we could even think about
two years ago. So it's changing very quickly,"" he said.	
 ""You look at the best companies today, the best
manufacturing companies today, they're very very sophisticated.
And you wouldn't have seen that 5-10 years ago.""	
 Indian suppliers no longer work on the principle of ""jugaad""
-- a Hindi word for muddling through problems with quick fixes
that flourished during the days of the so-called ""Licence Raj""
-- which had created a culture of short-termism and
inefficiency, LG's Verma said.	
 A more sophisticated supplier base makes it simpler and
cheaper for foreign firms to set up factories on Indian soil and
even look to India as a major exporter further down the line.	
 Cars leaving the assembly line of General Motors in
India are now up to 98 percent locally produced, designed with
the help of 2,000 engineers in the company's Bangalore offices.	
 Hyundai Motor Co has made India an export hub
for its vehicles. From 20 Santros sold to Nepal in 1999, the
firm exported 247,102 ""Made in India"" cars globally last year,
the highest number in any country outside the company's native
South Korea.	
 
 POLICY, INFRASTRUCTURE HURDLES	
 But India's infrastructure development has not kept pace
with the demands of its manufacturing. Power is in short supply,
highways are clogged with traffic and ports are too crowded. 
 The average cost to move a container within India is $945,
more than double the $460 it costs in China. Due to restrictions
on goods traffic, Hyundai can only ship cars from its Chennai
plant to the coast for seven hours at night, said Arvind Saxena,
a director of Hyundai Motor India. 
 ""Infrastructure has improved ... but yes, a lot still needs
to be done,"" he said.	
 LG's Verma would like to see the government adopt
China-style policies to foster growth of Indian suppliers.	
 ""The Chinese government has spent a huge lot of money,
creating cities where the vendors will be placed, creating
infrastructure there,"" he said. ""Those things are not in focus
in India.""	
 Companies have also grappled with slow or inconsistent
policy decisions from the Indian government. For example, five
years ago New Delhi rolled out a policy for so-called Special
Economic Zones (SEZs), hubs with long tax holidays that were set
up in Beijing's footsteps to spur manufacturing growth.	
 But the finance ministry slapped a 18.5 percent duty on book
profits in the zones in February's budget, sparking criticism
from the trade ministry that the tax would send the wrong signal
about India's credibility with investors. [ID:nSGE72908B]	
 Karl Slym, the head of GM India, cheers what he sees as
largely business-friendly policies from the government for auto
makers. But some decisions from New Delhi come out of the blue
and catch investors unawares, he said.	
 ""Nobody has the chance to be able to respond correctly or be
able to manage the situation,"" Slym told Reuters.	
 ""If you know what the outlook is, what the playing field is,
then you can plan accordingly for that. But if you start out
playing football on a football field and then all of a sudden
you're trying to play on a cricket field then you've got the
wrong equipment to be able to perform the best,"" he added.	
 Whatever its problems, the four companies interviewed by
Reuters remain largely optimistic on India's manufacturing rise.
And as global firms look to ride India's 9 percent growth story,
Asia's third-largest economy has also flexed its export muscle
with the growth of domestic brands. 
 The trade ministry has set India a target to double its
exports by 2014 to help keep the deficit in check. No longer
known just for its iconic exports such as textiles and gems,
India's manufacturers are becoming household names in sectors
such as cars, generic medicines and oil products.

debt restructuring could be ""catastrophic"", European Council
President Herman van Rompuy said in an interview, again ruling
out such a move.
 His comments are the latest in a series of denials by
senior Greek and European economic officials that a debt
restructuring could be in the offing as Greece has struggled to
right its public finances.
 ""The result of a restructuring could really be
catastrophic,"" van Rompuy told France's TV5 Le Monde. ""A
restructuring of Greece's debt is not on the table.""
 ""The negative consequences (of a restructuring) are much
more significant than the positive ones,"" he added.
 The comments are in line with what van Rompuy said on a
visit to Greece earlier this month, when he said a debt
restructuring was ""out of the question"".
 On Saturday, Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou
denied a media report that the International Monetary Fund
believed his country's debt burden was unsustainable and had
told European government and central bank officials that Athens
should restructure next year. [ID:nLDE73F0DO]
 Turning to Portugal, another European troublespot, van
Rompuy said its main political parties must agree on austerity
measures but he also complained that in many cases countries in
difficulty ""haven't been given enough time"" to restructure.

 * U.S. ""welcomes"" critique, but will it follow through?
 * IMF out to prove its value as honest broker
 By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON, April 17 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund finally seems to be baring teeth sharp enough to bite its
biggest shareholder -- the United States.
 The question is how Washington will respond.
 In the barrage of reports prepared for finance ministers
who met this weekend, the IMF questioned whether the United
States would meet a pledge to halve its budget deficit by 2013,
eliciting a swift response from the Treasury Department which
insisted the promise would be kept.
 The IMF also took the Obama administration to task over its
housing policy, and said the United States ought to count its
commitments to housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac on its already swollen balance sheet.
 ""The IMF suddenly is doing its best to seem even-handed,""
said Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and a
former IMF official.
 Prasad pointed to two factors behind the tougher tone:
Emerging markets have pressed the IMF to take a harder look at
the advanced economies that caused the 2007-2009 financial
crisis, and the United States hasn't strenuously objected to
the louder criticism.
 Indeed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- a
former IMF official himself -- said on Saturday that Washington
welcomed ""continued IMF surveillance of our fiscal and monetary
policies.""
 The IMF's tone shifted after its internal watchdog issued a
scathing report in February that said the fund failed to spot
the financial crisis brewing, in part because it was ""overly
influenced by and sometimes in awe of"" rich nations. For more,
see [ID:nN08102893]
 LOSING ITS SWAGGER
 Since the crisis, the United States has lost some of its
policy swagger. Emerging markets that had been on the receiving
end of sometimes unwanted advice from the West have begun
openly questioning U.S.-led economic orthodoxy.
 ""Some of the countries that are responsible for the deepest
crisis since the Great Depression, and have yet to solve their
own problems, are eager to prescribe codes of conduct to the
rest of the world,"" Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega
told the IMF's steering committee on Saturday.
 Many emerging markets have built up huge stockpiles of
currency reserves, partly as a form of self-insurance so that
they will never again have to come hat in hand to the IMF,
whose loans come with strict conditions.
 That has emboldened them to demand that the IMF treat
misbehaving advanced economies the same way that emerging
markets were treated when they suffered similar crises.
 Domenico Lombardi, president of the Oxford Institute for
Economic Policy, said the fund's ""unusually harsh"" tone toward
the United States was a way of proving it could be fair when it
reviews large countries' policies as part of a Group of 20
program announced on Friday.
 The United States is one of seven countries the G20 rich
and emerging economies designated for special review to
determine whether their domestic policies risked destabilizing
the global economy. The IMF is responsible for conducting the
reviews.
 ""Because this mandate the IMF has just received does not
come with enforcement powers, the only leverage it has is its
credibility, its respectability, as an honest broker,"" said
Lombardi, who is a former IMF executive board member.
 The lack of enforcement power has always been the IMF's
Achilles' heel. It can talk tough all it wants, but what
recourse does it have if no one listens?
 The fund has most clout when it is lending and can impose
strict conditions in return for aid.
 Lombardi, however, said Washington might be more willing
than in the past to take IMF advice and put it into action.
 Washington is already moving toward deficit reduction, and
Geithner is well aware that if the IMF takes a tougher tone
with the United States it will have more political cover to
talk tough to China.
 After two years of intensified bilateral meetings with
China, the United States has had little tangible success in
convincing Beijing to allow its yuan currency to rise faster in
value. It could use the IMF's backing as leverage.
 ""Treasury secretaries in the past have discounted benefits
from international cooperation,"" Lombardi said. ""Now the U.S.
has realized that it does not have the power to lead the world
alone. In order to assert its leadership, it has to engage in
international cooperation.""

 * Myriad actors could delay, complicate Greek debt response
 * Public backlash poses rising risk to policymakers
 * Mild restructuring solutions may just kick can down road
 
 By Noah Barkin, European Economics Correspondent
 LISBON, April 17 (Reuters) - For euro zone policymakers, the
question of how and when to restructure Greece's mountain of
debt is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma. There are no easy
answers and every option poses big risks for the currency bloc.
 A year after Greece secured a 110 billion euro ($159
billion) bailout from its European partners and the
International Monetary Fund, a loose consensus is emerging that
some form of restructuring is inevitable.
 Its economy mired in recession, Greece is struggling to meet
the fiscal targets set out for it in exchange for the rescue,
and market confidence in its finances is deteriorating daily.
 Barring a dramatic turn of events, it seems unlikely Athens
will be able to return to the capital markets next year to raise
the 25 billion euros it needs to service its debt.
 The German finance ministry have now come around to the view
that a restructuring is unavoidable, even if the Greek
government, European Central Bank, European Commission and IMF
continue to rule it out in their public statements.
 What does seem clear is that European governments and
institutions will face a stark choice over the coming year --
either they provide Greece with additional money in the hope
market sentiment turns positive at a later date, or they bite
the bullet and agree, together with Athens, to pursue western
Europe's first debt restructuring in six decades.
 The first option looks like a political no-go, given growing
opposition among voters to further bailouts in northern Europe.
 The second option raises the unsavory prospect of European
countries accepting losses on the loans they have already
provided to Greece and throws up the biggest question of all --
how to restructure the debt so as to avoid a new wave of
contagion that could crush the euro zone and spread elsewhere.
 Increasingly, it appears that the answer to this question
may be incompatible with what should be Europe's central goal in
this exercise, namely putting Greece on a sustainable debt path.
 ""The Greek government has no interest in caving in to a
restructuring today. Their approach is to wait in the hope that
things get better,"" said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for
European Policy Studies in Brussels. ""The problem is that every
day the choice gets a little more uncomfortable.""
 
 POLICY DIVISIONS, PUBLIC BACKLASH
 Complicating the decision-making process are the myriad
actors involved in this Greek tragedy -- from Prime Minister
George Papandreou in Athens to Chancellor Angela Merkel in
Berlin, their counterparts in other capitals, the European
Central Bank in Frankfurt and European Commission in Brussels.
 Each of these players has different interests and
priorities, both political and financial.
 Merkel and Papandreou face elections in late 2013 and will
be reluctant to make unpopular choices close to that date.
Jean-Claude Trichet's term as ECB president ends in half a year
and he will be loath to pursue a radical new course before then.
 All of this raises the risk of delays and a messy public
debate over the appropriate course of action for Greece, with
potentially damaging consequences for public sentiment.
 Already in traditionally pro-European countries like
Finland, anti-euro feelings are on the rise and threatening the
EU's efforts to shore up its weakest members.
 The longer the bloc's debt crisis drags on and Greece's debt
woes are left to fester, the higher the risk that leaders find
their room for manoeuvre on policy limited by angry citizens.
 ""Most intelligent people know there has to be a significant
restructuring to ease the burden on Greece, and we're not
talking about a painless extension of maturities, but wiping
away a large portion of the debt,"" said Charles Grant, director
of the Centre for European Reform in London.
 ""My worry is that the longer they leave it, the stronger the
euroscepticism becomes. When they finally do decide to
restructure the debt it will be too late.""
 Greece has roughly 325 billion euros ($469.8 billion) in
debt. By 2013, its burden is expected to approach 160 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) -- nearly double the level most
economists see as sustainable and far bigger than that of
Argentina when it defaulted in 2001.
 The strongest arguments against a restructuring have come
from the ECB, which holds an estimated 40-50 billion euros of
Greek sovereign debt itself.
 
 THE LEHMAN SPECTRE
 Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the ECB's Executive Board,
warned last week that a restructuring in which private creditors
were forced to take ""haircuts"", or losses, on their Greek debt
holdings would be akin to the 2008 decision to let U.S.
investment bank Lehman Brothers go bankrupt.
 It would crush Greek banks, which hold roughly a third of
the country's sovereign debt, and have ""devastating effects"" on
social cohesion and democracy in the country, he predicted. The
risks to banks outside of Greece cannot be ignored either.
 The latest figures from the Bank for International
Settlements show German banks had $26.3 billion worth of
exposure to Greek sovereign debt and French banks $19.8 billion
as of September 2010, relatively small sums when compared to
total banking assets in Europe's two largest economies.
 But when you add in their exposure to Greek banks and
non-bank private entities -- groups that could be hammered by
sovereign debt writedowns -- the figures show German and French
banks are owed a much larger $103.3 billion.
 Broaden that out to include Ireland and Portugal, two euro
zone countries which could also face pressure to restructure if
Greece goes down this path, and the contagion risks are clear.
The exposure of German and French banks hits $379.8 billion.
 ""Contagion is clearly a very serious issue. No one in their
right mind would advocate doing a restructuring if it can be
avoided,"" said Andre Sapir, a senior fellow at the Bruegel
economic policy think tank in Brussels.
 But despite these risks, Sapir believes a restructuring of
Greek debt should be done in the next one to two years.
 A major argument in favour of quick action is that by 2013,
more than half of Greece's outstanding debt will be held by the
EU and IMF. At that point, even the radical step of writing off
the total value of Greek debt held by the private sector may not
be enough to put the country on a sustainable debt course.
 ""Whatever restructuring has to be done, it should occur
before 2013. Otherwise it will be that much more painful,"" Sapir
said. ""At some stage you have to take your losses.""
 The problem with moving quickly is that European governments
have pledged not to force any ""haircuts"" on private lenders
before 2013, when the EU's new rescue mechanism is in place.
 As a result, German officials are reportedly exploring
milder options, including swapping Greek debt at market prices
for paper guaranteed by the euro zone, similar to the ""Brady
Bonds"" of the late 1980s, or buying up bonds and then retiring
the debt or extending maturities.
 But convincing debt holders to go along with these schemes
voluntarily will be difficult. They may also not make enough of
a dent in Greece's debt load to restore investor confidence.
Markets may view them as the first steps in a two-stage
restructuring, with the real pain yet to come.
 Despite its flaws, this ""restructuring lite"" path may be the
only one that is politically acceptable for now.
 The alternative is keeping Greece on EU life support for
years or moving ahead in the next year or so to eviscerate the
value of privately-held Greek paper, with all the contagion
risks and reputational damage to the euro zone that implies.
 Lee Buchheit, a lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton
in New York who advised Uruguay on its 2003 restructuring, says
regardless of what the EU decides, one message is clear from the
50-odd sovereign restructurings of the modern era:
 ""A sovereign debt crisis can be a painful experience for
both the debtor and creditors; a mismanaged sovereign debt
crisis can be a catastrophically painful experience.""

(Adds quotes, background)
 By Don Durfee and Sally Huang
 BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - China raised banks' required
reserves on Sunday for the fourth time this year, extending the
fight against excessive liquidity and stubbornly high inflation
in the world's second-largest economy.
 The reserve rate rise, which followed an increase in
benchmark bank interest rates on April 5, was the seventh since
China stepped up efforts against inflation in October and
underscored the government's determination to keep the economy
on an even keel.
 The move was not a surprise -- investors predicted more
tightening after last week's data showed an acceleration in
inflation, and more worryingly, sustained capital inflows that
threaten to keep inflationary pressure high.
 ""This rise continues the tightening measures of the central
bank,"" said Lin Songli, an economist with Guosen Securities in
Beijing. ""The first-quarter GDP shows that the whole economy is
good, so there is still space for tightening.""
 The central bank has also raised interest rates four times
since October, slapped price control measures on certain
commodities, and clamped down on property speculation.
 But price pressures driven by soaring global commodity
prices and abundant liquidity continue to plague the Chinese
economy.

 Central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan said on Saturday that
policy tightening will continue for sometime, as inflation is
higher that the government is comfortable with.
 And last week, Premier Wen Jiabao signalled a hawkish stance
for the coming months, saying that the government would use all
tools at its disposal to wrestle inflation under control.
 The 50-basis-point increase, effective from April 21, lifted
the required reserve ratio for the country's biggest banks to a
record 20.5 percent. It will lock up about 350 billion yuan
($53.6 billion) of cash that banks would otherwise be able to
lend.
 
 MORE TIGHTENING AHEAD
 The latest economic data showed China's turbo-charged
economic growth barely slowed in the first quarter, giving the
government more confidence to press ahead with policy
tightening.
 ""I think there will be more required reserves hikes in the
coming months, or even this month, but the possibility of an
interest rate rise this month is not that big,"" said Zhu
Jianfang, chief economist at Citic Securities in Beijing.
 The latest Reuters poll conducted on April 6 showed analysts
believe the central bank will raise banks' required reserves
three times this year by a total of 150 basis points and
increase interest rates just once more this year.
 But although economists have argued recently that the
central bank was near the end of its interest rate tightening
cycle, China's economic growth is still cruising near double
digits and the scope for China's government to continue
tightening may be bigger than previously anticipated.
 ""The inflation picture is still worrisome and bank lending
rebounded in March,"" said Zhao Xijun, economist at Renmin
University in Beijing. ""I think the central bank will raise
interest rate in the coming weeks -- probably in June.""
 March's inflation data showed consumer prices rising to 5.4
percent in the year to March, the fastest rate since July 2008,
from 4.9 percent in the first two months of the year.
 At the root of China's rising prices is the vast amount of
money flowing into economy. Reserve requirements are a direct
way of ring-fencing that excess cash, keeping banks from lending
out a large chunk of it and thereby slowing money growth. 
 China's foreign exchange reserves swelled by nearly $200
billion in the first quarter to more than $3 trillion,
indicating hefty capital inflows given that China had a $1.02
billion trade deficit during the first three months.
 Meanwhile, Chinese banks extended 679.4 billion yuan ($104
billion) in new local currency loans in March, while the broad
M2 measure of money supply rose 16.6 percent from a year
earlier, both above market expectations.

stage
 * PM Kan says recovery is chance for Japan 'rebirth'
 * Nuclear operator aims for cold shutdown in 6-9 months
(Updates with TEPCO and government comments)	
 By Chisa Fujioka and Matt Spetalnick	
 TOKYO, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton urged Japan on Sunday to remain active on the world
stage and pledged support for Washington's key ally in East Asia
as the operator of a stricken nuclear plant finally set out a
timeline to shut it down.	
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) said it hoped to
achieve a cold shutdown of the plant that was crippled in the
March 11 quake and tsunami -- effectively making the reactors
safe and stable -- within six to nine months.	
 ""Economically, diplomatically and in so many other ways,
Japan is indispensable to global problem-solving,"" Clinton told
a news conference after talks with Japanese Foreign Minister
Takeaki Matsumoto. ""And the U.S.-Japan alliance is as
indispensable as ever to global security and progress.""	
 Clinton also said Japan and the United States had agreed to
create a ""public-private partnership for reconstruction"" under
the guidance of Japan's government, and that U.S. firms and
organisations would begin discussing how they can support Japan
as it comes through the crisis.	
 Soon after she spoke, TEPCO gave a briefing
outlining its plan to bring the plant to cold shutdown.	
 Even if the operator does manage to do that within six to
nine months, Japan hinted on Sunday that a full recovery was
likely to take longer.	
 ""The first juncture towards safety would be when the fuel
rods are fully submerged in water and a cold shut down is
achieved,"" said Banri Kaieda, Japan's economics minister.	
 ""But true safety will not come until the fuel rods are
removed from the reactors,"" Kaieda told a news conference on
Sunday.	
 Kaieda also said he advised TEPCO not to dump contaminated
water, no matter how low the radiation level, into the ocean in
future.	
 The operator's decision earlier this month to pump water
contaminated with low levels of radiation had raised the ire of
Japan's neighbours China and South Korea.	
 
 Clinton arrived in Japan, which is still reeling from the
triple disaster nearly five weeks later, on the final leg of a
global trek that took her to Berlin for NATO talks on the Libya
conflict and to Seoul to tackle the North Korean nuclear
stand-off and boost trade talks with another key ally in Asia.	
 The still rising death toll from the quake and tsunami has
topped 13,000. The natural disaster and the nuclear crisis that
followed have seriously rattled the world's third-largest
economy.	
 Damages from the quake and tsunami have been estimated at
$300 billion, making it the world's costliest natural disaster.	
 Washington has deployed thousands of troops plus military
aircraft and navy ships to help with relief work in the
devastated northeastern part of the island nation.	
 Clinton, during her 5-1/2 hour stop, said there was no
reason for Americans to stay away from Japan, other than the
area around the nuclear plant.	
 ""We have encouraged businesses and other Americans to go on
with their normal lives and to travel to Japan for business and
other reasons,"" she said.	
 Clinton is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit in a
gesture of solidarity with Japan since it was engulfed in its
worst crisis since World War Two.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan has insisted the nuclear situation
is slowly stabilising and the country must now focus on recovery
from the 9.0-magnitude quake and the tsunami it unleashed.	
 ""I believe ... this difficult period will provide us with a
precious window of opportunity to secure the 'Rebirth of
Japan',"" Kan wrote in an editorial in the online version of
Sunday's International Herald Tribune newspaper.	
 He said Japan would remain internationally engaged while it
recovers from the disasters.	
 
 GLOBAL ECONOMIC PILLAR	
 In the meantime, Washington is concerned about harm to the
economic health of a key trading partner and a pillar of the
global economy.	
 Japan's economics minister warned last week that the damage
was likely to be worse than first thought as power shortages
would cut factory output and disrupt supply chains. The Bank of
Japan governor said the economy was in a ""severe state"", while
central bankers were uncertain when efforts to rebuild the
northeast would boost growth.	
 Japan's nuclear disaster has also raised concern in the
United States about President Barack Obama's push for expanded
nuclear energy to help wean Americans off their dependence on
foreign oil.	
 Neighbouring China and South Korea have become increasingly
alarmed over the risk of radiation spreading from Japan, and
several countries have banned or restricted food imports.	
 Japanese voters last weekend vented their anger at the
government's handling of the nuclear and humanitarian crisis,
with Kan's ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) losing nearly
70 seats in local elections.	
 A fragile political detente with opposition parties has
already collapsed and on Sunday, one of Kan's chief rivals in
the DPJ, Ichiro Ozawa, hinted he would vote in favour of a
no-confidence motion against Kan, according to the Mainichi
newspaper.	
 Kan was already under pressure to step down before the March
11 disasters, although any no confidence motion would need the
support of more than 70 MPs from his own party.

 TOKYO, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton flew to Japan on Sunday to show support for a close ally
struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake and tsunami
that killed thousands and triggered a nuclear crisis.	
 Clinton arrived in Japan, which is still reeling from the
triple disaster nearly five weeks ago, on the final leg of a
global trek that took her to Berlin for NATO talks on the Libya
conflict and to Seoul to tackle the North Korean nuclear
standoff.	
 She planned to meet unpopular Prime Minister Naoto Kan and
Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto in Tokyo and was also invited
to tea with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial
Residence.	
 The top U.S. diplomat was expected to renew the Obama
administration's commitment to do its utmost to assist
rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of the March 11 quake and
tsunami, which killed up to 28,000 people, crippled a nuclear
power plant and seriously rattled the world's third-largest
economy.	
 Damages have been estimated at $300 billion, making it the
world's costliest natural disaster.	
 
 Washington has deployed thousands of troops plus military
aircraft and navy ships to help with relief work in the
devastated northeastern part of the island nation.	
 A senior U.S. official said one of Clinton's key messages
would be that Japan should not withdraw from the world stage.	
 ""We all recognise that Japan is in a critical phase, and we
want to encourage them as they rebuild and recover to maintain
an international focus, that this crisis does not trigger an
inward-looking Japan,"" the official told reporters during
Clinton's stop in Seoul.	
 Clinton was in South Korea to promote a trade pact with
Asia's fourth largest economy.	
 Clinton is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit in a
gesture of solidarity with Japan, one of Washington's closest
Asian allies, since it was engulfed in its worst crisis since
World War Two.	
 Her 5-1/2-hour stop comes after a week in which the Japanese
government put its nuclear calamity on a par with the world's
worst nuclear disaster, Chernobyl, after new data showed that
more radiation had leaked from its crippled Fukushima Daiichi
power plant than first thought.	
 Kan has insisted the nuclear situation is slowly stabilising
and the country must now focus on recovery from the
9.0-magnitude quake and the tsunami it unleashed.	
 ""I believe ... this difficult period will provide us with a
precious window of opportunity to secure the 'Rebirth of
Japan',"" Kan wrote in an editorial in the online version of
Sunday's International Herald Tribune newspaper.	
 He said Japan would remain internationally engaged while it
recovers from the disasters.	
 ""I believe that the best way for Japan to reciprocate ...
the cordial friendship extended to us is to continue our
contribution to the development of the international community,""
he wrote.

 * Legislation pending in S. Korea parliament
 * Lee commends US leadership over Libya
(Adds U.S. official, meeting with president)	
 By Matt Spetalnick	
 SEOUL, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said on Sunday that concluding a long-delayed free trade
agreement with South Korea was a priority for the Obama
administration, and it was committed to getting the deal done
this year. 
 Clinton told a gathering of business leaders in Seoul that,
beyond the economic benefits, the pact was ""profoundly in
America's strategic interest as well"".	
 ""Getting this done together sends a powerful message that
America and Korea are partners for the long-term and that
America is fully embracing its role as a Pacific power,"" she
said.	
U.S. and South Korean trade negotiators struck a deal in
December on a free trade pact, which was signed in 2007 but had
not been ratified for three years because of U.S. auto and beef
industry concerns. 
Both the U.S. Congress and the South Korean parliament have
yet to pass bills to approve the pact, despite U.S. President
Barack Obama's renewed push for ratification. 
""I want to state as strongly as I can how committed the Obama
Administration is to passing the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement
this year,"" she told a gathering of business leaders in Seoul
during a whirlwind trip through South Korea and Japan. 
 A U.S. official added that Washington hoped to have the FTA
ratified by Congress well before an Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in November.	
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk has previously said the
Obama administration wanted to win congressional approval of a
free trade agreement before July. The agreement is pending in
South Korea's parliament and is expected to be passed. 
Clinton said the pact -- which Washington says will increase
exports of American goods by $11 billion and create tens of
thousands of jobs -- is ready for review by Congress. 
Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of
Representatives Ways and Means Committee, last month criticised
Republicans for refusing to move ahead on the South Korea deal
until the White House sends Congress implementing bills for
long-delayed trade agreements with Colombia and Panama. 
 
 PENDING TRADE DEALS	
Republicans broadly support the South Korea deal, but have
threatened to block a vote on the pact unless the White House
also submits the other two pending trade deals for approval. 
""This is a priority for me, for President Obama and for the
entire administration,"" Clinton said. ""We are determined to get
it done, and I believe we will.""	
 The United States and the European Union are racing against
each other to be the first to seal a free trade agreement with
South Korea, the world's 15th largest economy, hoping to get a
jumpstart on the benefits of increased business deals.	
 The European Parliament approved a South Korea free-trade
deal in February, clearing the way for the EU's largest
bilateral free trade deal to take effect from
July.[ID:nLDE71G18U]	
 The shift in focus to Asia follows Clinton's attendance at a
NATO conference in Berlin, where the alliance's foreign
ministers faced strains over a Western air campaign in Libya
against forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi. 
 Clinton met South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Sunday,
who commended her for Washington's ""exceptional leadership"" in
handling the situation Libya. 
 She was due in Tokyo later on Sunday for a flying visit in a
show of support following last month's earthquake and tsunami
disasters that killed thousands and crippled a nuclear plant.

 By Jan Strupczewski and David Milliken
 WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - Greece has no plans to
restructure its debt and the International Monetary Fund has
held no talks about it, the country's finance minister, George
Papaconstantinou, said on Saturday.
 ""Restructuring is simply not on the cards,"" he told Reuters
on the sidelines of an IMF meeting in Washington. ""I think that
the situation will improve and we will be able to go back to
the markets in 2012.""
 Some media on Saturday reported that unnamed sources were
saying the IMF believed Greece's debt burden was unsustainable
and had told European government and central bank officials
that Athens should consider restructuring by next year.
 The reports said a restructuring could involve giving
Greece more time to pay back its debt or reducing the amount it
has to pay back to investors.
 Papaconstantinou denied the report.
 ""We talk with the IMF all the time. There is no such
discussion,"" he said.
 A German deputy foreign minister on Friday said that a
voluntary Greek debt restructuring would not be a disaster and
that Berlin would support it.
 The German Finance Ministry on Saturday denied it was
drawing up contingency plans for a Greek debt restructuring,
after a report that it was studying various options if Athens
failed to meet fiscal targets..
 Papaconstantinou said Greece was focused on implementing
its structural reform and fiscal consolidation plan, and still
believed that the country could return to debt markets and sell
new bonds next year.
 ""The Greek government has made it very clear that we are
continuing the fiscal program and that we are continuing with
the program of structural reforms. There is a major
privatization drive ... to bring the debt down,"" he said.
 He noted markets were nervous now because of negotiations
on an EU/IMF bailout for Portugal, but would calm down.
 ""When all the European issues are settled -- and I think
they will be in the next few months -- and as we keep following
the program, which shows we are reducing the deficit, ... I
think that the situation will improve and we will be able to go
back to the markets as planned for 2012,"" Papaconstantinou
said.
 Asked how he planned to convince investors they would be
paid back all the money Greece owed, Papaconstantinou said: ""To
convince the market you have to show you will be able to run a
convincing primary surplus. We have done that before and we
will do so again.""
 ""Our structural reforms are a supply shock to the economy,
and a positive one, and therefore that will increase our growth
potential. And we can have an interest rate burden that is
manageable. The recent decision by the European Council,
cutting the rate we pay by 1 percentage point, has been very
good,"" he said.

 WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund should recommend national policies that spur excessive
flows of capital into other economies as well as policies that
seek to temper them, the IMF's steering committee said on
Saturday.
 ""Giving due regard to country-specific circumstances and
the benefits of financial integration, such an approach should
encompass recommendations for both policies that give rise to
outward capital flows and the management of inflows,"" the panel
of IMF member nations said in a communique.
 The International Monetary and Financial Committee, a group
of finance officials from around the world, said the global
economy was strengthening but that policy action was needed
given ""significant risks"" threatening the recovery.
 ""Credible actions are needed to accelerate progress in
addressing challenges to financial stability and sovereign debt
sustainability, and to ensure timely fiscal consolidation in
advanced economies,"" it said.
 It also said steps were needed to prevent an inflationary
overheating of emerging market economies and to deal with risks
posed by higher commodity prices.
 The IMF steering committee also called for further work
toward widening the basket of currencies that compose the
fund's accounting unit, the Special Drawing Right.
 Leading world economies have been working on a plan to
include the Chinese yuan in the SDR basket. Progress, however,
has been slow, in part because of China's policy of keeping the
yuan on a tight leash. SDR currencies are supposed to be
""freely usable.""

 * Analysts say rouble could weaken by 20-30 pct
 * Central bank lost a quarter of forex reserves this year
 
 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, April 16 (Reuters) - Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko hinted at rouble  devaluation on Saturday, a
day after making contradictory statements on the matter and
blaming Belarus' economic and security woes on unknown enemies.
 Having lost a quarter of its foreign currency reserves this
year, Belarus has effectively maintained multiple exchange rates
since March 30 in a bid to avoid official devaluation as Minsk
sought financial aid from Russia.
 However, on Saturday, after attending a subbotnik -- a day
of volunteer community work -- in Minsk, Lukashenko indicated it
could happen very soon.
 Asked when the rouble's  exchange rate would become
balanced, Lukashenko told reporters: ""Exchange rate is a matter
of a few days... Today or tomorrow we will improve the situation
on the currency market.""
 He said the government would also cut spending and lending
-- steps the International Monetary Fund has urged it to take
along with devaluation. [ID:nLDE7351A7]
 The Belarussian rouble  needs devaluation of between
20-30 percent, analysts say, to reflect the country's large
current account deficit.
 Belarus has so far refused to let its currency weaken and on
Friday Lukashenko said the devaluation was not yet needed.
 
 PART OF A 'CHAIN'
 This week, the already weakened nation experienced a fresh
shock when a bomb blast tore through a packed metro station in
central Minsk in the evening rush hour time on April 11. Five
suspects were detained within the next two days. [ID:nLDE73E1GU]
 Lukashenko has blamed the bombing on those seeking to
destabilise Belarus and said the attack was part of the same
""chain"" as the currency crisis and rumours of food shortages
that have prompted brief panic buying of sugar and sunoil.
 Belarus' foreign currency reserves have fallen by a quarter
to $3.7 billion so far this year as the central bank tried to
support the rouble until mid-March.
 Last month, Belarus allowed a de facto 10 percent rouble
 devaluation on the interbank market and announced a hike
in interest rates to encourage people to keep money in banks in
the national currency.
 It has, however, insisted on the use of the official
exchange rate in retail cash transactions and on the currency
exchange where exporters sell their foreign currency to the
central bank.
 Belarus has asked Russia for $3 billion in loans but Moscow
says Minsk has yet to submit a credible plan of economic
stabilisation.

 * Countries should consider ""the cost of failure,"" he says
 * New WTO documents next week expected to show big gaps
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - Nearly a decade worth of
work to reach a world trade deal is on the verge of ""failure,""
World Trade Organization Director General Pascal Lamy said on
Saturday in a plea for countries to rise above their own narrow
interests for the good of the global economy.
 ""The WTO system is in grave risk of not being able to
conclude a round started almost 10 years ago,"" Lamy told
members of the International Monetary Fund just a few months
after Group of 20 leaders urged negotiators to strike a deal by
the end of this year in the long-running talks.
 Lamy, in a prepared text of his remarks, said the
negotiations were ""stalling on the last hurdles"" of the Doha
round of world trade talks launched in late 2001 with the goal
of helping poor countries prosper through trade.
 He asked finance ministers attending this weekend's
meetings of the IMF and the World Bank ""to go back to your
capitals and ask your leaders to consider the cost of failure
of these negotiations, both from a micro perspective, as from a
macroeconomic point of view.""
 The urgent appeal came as chairs of key WTO negotiating
committees were expected to present new documents next week in
Geneva showing wide gaps in the negotiations on agriculture,
manufactured goods and services at the heart of the talks.
 The failure of intensified efforts since the start of the
year to bridge those differences has caused many to wonder the
point of continuing the nearly 10-year-old talks -- and some to
conclude they are already dead.
 The United States, which has been under pressure since the
start to agree to deep cuts in its farm subsidies as part of a
deal, has pressed big emerging countries such as China, India
and Brazil to make better offer to open their markets to more
agriculture, manufactured goods and services exports.
 Trade ministers from those countries, meeting this week
with Russia and South Africa, rallied around a July 2008 draft
WTO text they said offered ""a delicate balance of trade-offs""
but the United States says it fails to provide enough new
export opportunities to make the deal attractive.
 On Tuesday, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said
there was ""no reason to be optimistic"" about the chances of
success in the Doha talks and said the European Union had to
start thinking instead about ""Plan B,"" an apparent reference to
more bilateral and regional free trade deals.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk a day later accused
China, India and Brazil of shirking their responsibility to
further open their markets, not just for the benefit of the
United States but for poor countries that make up the bulk of
the WTO's 153 members.
 ""No three economies have benefited more from trade
liberalization over the last 10 years than China, India and
Brazil. That's a good thing,"" Kirk said in a speech.
 ""If I can just be blunt, the question is whether they are
willing to walk in the room, close the door and hammer out a
deal,"" Kirk said.
 Lamy did not blame any individual countries in his remarks,
but urged governments to ""look at the wider picture and keep
some distance from narrow national interests.""
 Countries can't afford to take for granted the rules-based
world trading system that has prevented a repeat of the
tit-for-tat trade actions that many blame for the Great
Depression, Lamy said.
 ""We are not only just forgetting the lessons of the distant
past, but also of the recent past, when the system shielded us
from worst economic woes,"" Lamy said.

 * BarCap sees earnings at $8.86 bln in 2012, vs $3.8 in 2010
 * EBITDA seen doubling, hitting up to $12.9 bln by 2012
 
 By Quentin Webb
 LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Glencore is already worth as
much as $69 billion, with its earnings set to double in two
years, according to research from two banks underwriting the
commodity trader's potentially record-breaking listing.
 Glencore's banks are distributing research to potential
investors to help convince them to back the previously insular
trader as it seeks to raise as much as $12.1 billion.
 Research from Barclays Capital and Credit Suisse -- not
distributed to the media but seen by Reuters -- also forecasts
rapid growth in key measures of profitability, such as earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
 Barclays says Glencore's equity is now worth $52.5 billion
to $69.2 billion, while Credit Suisse values the Swiss firm, led
by former coal trader Ivan Glasenberg, at $53 billion to $68.6
billion.
 Pre-flotation research typically excludes funds raised by
selling new shares, in this case up to $8.8 billion.
 If that is the situation here, it would mean the banks think
that Glencore could ultimately be worth as much as $78 billion
after a listing -- even more than the top of the $45-$73 billion
range implied by Glencore's own figures.
 The banks declined to comment.
 Valuation is a challenge for a complex business that is part
trader, part miner, and part investor -- a 34.5-percent stake in
Xstrata Plc is Glencore's biggest listed holding.
 Glencore is aiming to sell a 15 to 20 percent stake worth $9
to $11 billion, including $2.2 billion of existing shares and
the option to sell an extra 10 percent.
 Barclays says earnings will hit $8.86 billion in 2012 -- or
more than double last year, when net profit was $3.8 billion.
 Glencore's EBITDA will also far surpass 2007's record $7.7
billion by 2012, the duo forecast.
 In the next two years, Barclays says it will more than
double to hit $12.9 billion, while Credit Suisse predicts it
will touch $11.76 billion. The rise far outstrips analysts'
average forecast of a 48-percent rise at Xstrata.
 
 LIMITED INFLUENCE?
 The banks use a range of measures to value Glencore,
including ""sum of the parts"" valuations and price-to-earnings
and enterprise value to EBITDA ratios.
 On an EV/EBITDA basis, Glencore should fetch a premium to
European miners, because of a lower tax base and less volatile
earnings thanks to its marketing business, Barclays says.
 It says a long-mooted merger with Xstrata would make ""a very
attractive company"" but the financing of such a deal ""remains
unclear"" and would require significant debt or equity funding.
 Credit Suisse's estimates earnings before interest and tax
will more than treble in two years at the mines and smelters
Glencore controls. However it warns the firm ""does not have a
proven track record in delivering significant, capex intensive
project growth"".
 New investors will control less than a quarter of the
company, the Swiss bank notes, and ""their ability to influence
significant/company transforming transactions may be limited.""
 The banks are among nine working on the IPO. Credit Suisse
is one of the top three, known as joint global co-ordinators,
while BarCap is a co-bookrunner.

 * N. Korean nuclear issue, Japan crises also on agenda

(Adds senior U.S. official)
 By Matt Spetalnick
 SEOUL, April 16 (Reuters) - Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton flew to South Korea on Saturday to reassure Seoul about
the U.S. commitment to sealing a long-delayed trade deal and to
coordinate strategy over the North Korea nuclear standoff.
 Clinton arrived for talks with South Korean Foreign Minister
Kim Sung-hwan on Saturday and President Lee Myung-bak on Sunday,
before a trip to Japan in a gesture of support following last
month's earthquake and tsunami disasters that killed thousands
and crippled a nuclear plant.
 The shift in focus to Asia follows Clinton's attendance at a
NATO conference in Berlin where the alliance's foreign ministers
faced strains over a Western air campaign in Libya against
forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi.
 U.S. and South Korean trade negotiators struck a deal in
December on a free trade pact, which was signed in 2007 but had
not been ratified for three years because of U.S. auto and beef
industry concerns.
 However, both the U.S. Congress and the South Korean
parliament have yet to pass bills to approve the pact, despite
U.S. President Barack Obama's renewed push for ratification.
 ""I'm very encouraged and determined about the passage of the
free trade agreement,"" said Clinton, sitting across a conference
table from Kim in Seoul. ""We will be consulting and making the
case together to our respective legislatures and I'm very
confident there will be a positive outcome.""
 ""It is important that we're meeting in the home stretch of
the Korean free trade agreement,"" she added.
 Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of
Representatives Ways and Means Committee, last month criticised
Republicans for refusing to move ahead on the South Korea deal
until the White House sends Congress implementing bills for
long-delayed trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.
 Republicans broadly support the South Korea deal, but have
threatened to block a vote on the pact unless the White House
also submits the other two pending trade deals for approval.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk has said the Obama
administration wants to win congressional approval of a free
trade agreement before July. The agreement is currently pending
in South Korea's parliament and is expected to be passed.
 The U.S. International Trade Commission estimated in 2007
the South Korean agreement would boost U.S. exports by about
$10-11 billion annually, while increasing imports from that
country by about $6.5-7.0 billion.
 
 NORTH KOREA
 Clinton's visit also comes amid a diplomatic flurry that
could bring renewed efforts to resume long-stalled six-nation
talks with Pyongyang aimed at curbing its nuclear weapons
ambitions. 
 A South Korean nuclear envoy was in Washington this week
meeting senior U.S. officials.
 North Korea has slipped down U.S. President Barack Obama's
policy agenda recently as he has focused heavily on turmoil in
the Middle East, including the Libya conflict, and economic and
budget problems at home.
 Pyongyang has said it wants to return to nuclear talks, but
Seoul and Washington have questioned its sincerity -- pointing
to revelations in November about major advances in Pyongyang's
uranium enrichment programme.
 A senior U.S. official said Clinton's visit was also
intended to show support for South Korea's openness to renewed
dialogue with the North, which Washington sees as a prerequisite
for returning to six-party talks.
 ""I would like to express our deep appreciation for your
steadfast support and close coordination with us in dealing with
North Korean issues,"" South Korea's Kim said.
 North Korea's latest overtures follow a recent spate of
hostile actions, including the shelling of a South Korean island
on Nov. 23 and its suspected sinking of a South Korean ship just
over a year ago.
 Pyongyang had promised to abandon its nuclear programs under
a 2005 aid-for-disarmament deal that collapsed amid accusations
on both sides that neither kept its end of the bargain. 
 The North tested nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009 and has
also conducted long-range missile tests.
 Clinton and her South Korean hosts also discussed Japan's
triple disaster, which has drawn sympathy but also criticism
from its neighbours for Tokyo's management of its nuclear woes.
 ""We all recognize that Japan is in a critical phase and we
want to encourage them as they rebuild and recover to maintain
an international focus, that this crisis does not trigger an
inward-looking Japan,"" the U.S. official said.

 BOAO, China, April 16 (Reuters) - Europe is likely to be hit
the hardest among major economies by a potential global slowdown
in 2012, but China's $300 billion sovereign wealth fund is still
looking for investment opportunities there, its head said on
Saturday.	
 Lou Jiwei, chairman of China Investment Corp , told
the Boao Forum for Asia on the southern Chinese island of Hainan
that he saw the global economy slowing, if not going back into
recession, in 2012 as some economies withdraw stimulus and
others tighten policy.	
 Europe faces the most bleak future among major economies, in
part because the sovereign debt crisis in some euro zone
countries is unlikely to end soon, casting a shadow over the
euro's future, Lou said.	
 ""The domestic market in Europe is not recovering very fast,
so most likely Europe's economy is driven by external demand,""
Lou said.	
 ""But that does not mean we are not willing to invest in
Europe. ... We are also seeking concentrated investment
opportunities in Europe,"" he said.	
 Lou pointed to some institutional arrangements in Europe as
providing more attractive opportunities than in some other
countries.	
 ""For instance, in infrastructure deals, the PPP
(public-private partnership) model in Europe is much better than
in the United States,"" Lou said.	
 As to the challenges facing the global economy, Lou said
major economies may change their current pro-growth policies in
the fourth quarter of this year, hurting economic performance.	
 In addition, oil supplies will likely be interrupted by the
unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, he added.	
 Lou said the economic situation in the United States would
remain largely unchanged.	
 He also expected emerging markets to raise interest rates
and allow their currencies to strengthen, causing a slowdown in
economic growth in those countries.	
 CIC was set up in 2007 to invest a slice of China's massive
foreign exchange reserves, which have ballooned to $3.05

 By Leika Kihara	
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Japan will lay out a
medium-term plan for fiscal reform when it crafts a second extra
budget for reconstruction around mid-year, the finance minister
said, aiming to dispel market concern that last month's
devastating earthquake may delay the country's efforts to rein
in its huge public debt.	
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he has vowed
to his Group of 20 counterparts that the central bank will keep
monetary policy ultra-loose to support an economy hit hard by
the March 11 earthquake.	
 ""I explained that once the current severe supply constraints
ease, Japan's economy will gradually resume a recovery. I think
we gained our counterparts' understanding,"" Shirakawa told a
news conference on Friday, after the G20 finance leaders'
gathering.	
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told the same news
conference the government's near-term priority was to pass
through parliament an initial extra budget for disaster relief,
which is set to exceed 4 trillion yen ($48 billion).	
 While the first emergency budget will not involve issuance
of fresh bonds, a ""significant amount of funds"" may be needed
for the second extra budget for reconstruction, Noda said.	
 Even so, the government needs to be mindful of ""people who
worry whether Japan will stray away from fiscal discipline"", he
said, cautioning against issuing bonds easily with Japan's
public debt already twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.	
 ""The government should lay out its medium-term fiscal reform
plan at the same time it compiles the (second) emergency budget
for reconstruction,"" Noda said, signalling that the roadmap for
fiscal reform should be issued around mid-year.	
 Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War Two after a
9.0 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami battered its northeast
coast last month, crippling a nuclear power plant and disrupting
factory output with supply disruptions and power shortages.	
 The government estimates the material damage alone could top
$300 billion, making it by far the world's costliest natural
disaster, but analysts say the cost may be much higher.	
 The negative impact of the quake was cited as among the
downside risks for the global economy in a G20 communique issued
on Friday, although Noda and Shirakawa stressed that Japan's
economy can overcome the challenges posed by the disaster.	
 Some lawmakers have called on the government to spend big
and issue bonds to finance the costs to support the economy,
although Noda has been cautious of doing so on concern of
scaring investors already wary of Japan's huge debt pile.

(Recasts, adds further comments from Zhou)	
 By Zhou Xin and Ben Blanchard	
 BOAO, China, April 16 (Reuters) - China's monetary policy
tightening will continue for some time as inflation remains
higher than the government is comfortable with, and the yuan
will be one of the tools used to fight it, the central bank
governor said on Saturday.	
 Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People's Bank of China, said
China was using the yuan as a tool in fighting
inflation and will make the currency more flexible over time.	
 ""The shift from a moderately loose monetary stance to a
prudent one means tightening, and this stance will continue for
a while,"" Zhou told a press briefing on the sidelines of the
Boao Forum for Asia on the tropical Chinese island of Hainan.	
 The yuan has risen 4.5 percent against the dollar since the
end of a de facto peg last June, but it has fallen by 4.3
percent since that time against a trade-weighted basket on
account of dollar weakness, data from the Bank for International
Settlements show. [ID:nL3E7FG035]	
 Zhou said China did not have pre-set targets for the yuan's
value. Instead, Beijing would respect the role of market demand
and supply in deciding the yuan's exchange rate.	
 He noted that international calls for a stronger yuan were
in line with China's own efforts to adjust its economic
structure and boost incomes, but said there was still no
timetable for when the currency would become fully convertible.	
 China could not accept accusations that the yuan was a cause
of global financial turmoil, he added.	
 ""If you regard China's yuan issue as the key cause of the
international financial crisis and want to use the yuan as the
key solution to overcome the crisis, then we can't agree with
that,"" he said.	
 
 NO UPPER LIMIT FOR RESERVE RATIOS	
 Zhou said the March inflation reading of 5.4 percent from a
year earlier was higher than the government target, meaning the
central bank had to take further measures to ease price
increases.	
 But he said China would be cautious in raising borrowing
costs further, out of concern for attracting inflows of
speculative capital seeking returns not only from yuan
appreciation but higher interest rates.	
 The PBOC has increased benchmark interest rates four times
since last October, bringing its rates much higher than in
economies such as the United States.	
 ""The international market has excessive liquidity, and if we
raise interest rates in an excessive or aggressive manner, we
may attract big hot money inflows,"" Zhou said.	
 The PBOC has increasingly relied on quantitative tools to
mop up excess cash in the financial system, now requiring the
country's big banks to set aside a record-high 20.0 percent of
their deposits as reserves. [ID:nTOE722076] 
 Asked whether there was a ceiling for the reserve ratio,
Zhou said there was no absolute upper limit, leaving open the
possibility of further increases.	
 As the deposit reserve ratio is a tool designed to soak up
liquidity, Beijing would use it when necessary, he said, noting
that banks still received interest on the required reserves from
the central bank.	
 Zhou said China's rare trade deficit in the first quarter
was mainly caused by commodity price increases, and that China
does not welcome a deficit for such a reason, or higher
commodity prices.	
 He said the yuan would be used by companies more often for
settling trade in future if the dollar proves ""unstable"".

 Leading world economies agreed on Friday to put the policies
of seven major nations under a microscope as part of a plan to
prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis. 
 Under the deal, the International Monetary Fund will look
at national levels of debt, budget deficits and trade balances
to determine whether a nation's policies are putting the global
economy at risk and should be changed. [ID:nN15205055]	
 Zhou said these indicators would provide a handy reference
point for China in managing its economy.	
 ""For China, it is like a test, and you don't expect to
achieve full marks right away at the beginning,"" he said.	
 With or without external indicators, China has been working
hard to achieve sustainable development, Zhou noted.	
 ""In this regard, (the new indicators) will provide us with a
new perspective,"" Zhou said, adding he had not looked at the
details of the new pact agreed in Washington.	
 He also reiterated the view that China was still
under-represented at the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank in terms of the size of the Chinese economy.	
 ""For China, the adjustment (of voting rights) is still not
enough, at least in terms of GDP size,"" Zhou said.

 * China says satisfied with G20 agreement

(Adds analyst comment)
 By Daniel Flynn and Wanfeng Zhou
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Leading world economies
agreed on Friday to put the policies of seven major nations
under a microscope as part of a plan to prevent a repeat of the
global financial crisis.
 The pact was agreed by the Group of 20 nations after months
of wrangling highlighted by China's fears that its policy of
limiting its currency's rise was being targeted.
 Under the deal, the International Monetary Fund will look
at national levels of debt, budget deficits and trade balances
to determine if a nation's policies are putting the global
economy at risk and should be changed.
 One potential shortcoming is that countries will not be
bound to follow any recommendations that emerge.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said the
agreement marked ""huge progress"" on the path to more balanced
world growth and said seven major economies would automatically
be subject to review. Others could face scrutiny as well if
their policies are found to be stoking global risks.
 ""The net is a little bit tighter for those countries that
are considered of systemic importance,"" Lagarde said.
 France is president of the G20 this year.
 Countries representing more than 5 percent of the combined
output of the G20 will be examined by the IMF under the deal.
 The list would include the debt-burdened United States and
export-rich China -- the two main economies at the heart of the
debate over global imbalances. France, Britain, Germany, Japan
and India would round out the list, officials said.
 ""Our aim is to promote external sustainability and ensure
that G20 members pursue the full range of policies required to
reduce excessive imbalances,"" G20 finance officials said in a
communique issued at the close of a full-day meeting.
 Many economists say global imbalances -- notably the gaping
and persistent U.S. trade gap and correspondingly large surplus
in China -- laid ground for the 2007-2009 crisis, which ended
with the worst global recession since World War II.
 The G20 has become the main forum to prevent similar
boom-bust cycles. Agreeing on how best to do that has grown
difficult now that the darkest days of crisis have passed.
 Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution
and former IMF official, said the real test of the latest plan
from the G20 rich and emerging economies will come once all the
numbers are filled in and countries have to answer for policies
that are deemed a danger to the world.
 ""Once the numbers are put on the table, that's when you'll
start to see the pushback,"" he said.
 The G20 appeared to offer room for countries to sidestep
criticism. ""National circumstances will ... be taken into
account,"" it said without elaboration.
 It said the global recovery was strengthening but warned of
continued risks, including the political unrest in the Middle
East and North Africa and the disasters in Japan.
 PROGRESS ON CAPITAL CONTROLS
 Officials also agreed to keep working on a framework for
determining when countries can use controls over capital
inflows -- a sensitive topic for emerging market nations that
are fighting inflation stoked by ""hot money"" from countries
with low interest rates, such as the United States.
 Brazil has resisted efforts to restrict the use of capital
controls. ""We don't want high levels of global liquidity to
turn into problems for the Brazilian economy,"" the country's
central bank chief, Alexandre Tombini, said on Friday.
 European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian
Noyer said officials ""made enormous progress"" on the issue.
 ""We do not any more have two fronts, one saying there
should be total freedom and never any measure taken, and the
other saying each country should have total faculty to do
whatever it feels necessary,"" he said.
 Policymakers from advanced economies, led by the United
States, have argued that emerging nations can combat inflows
and price pressures by allowing their currencies to strengthen
against the dollar. They say if countries such as China were to
do so it would help balance world trade.
 Emerging nations, in contrast, blame near zero interest
rates in the United States for sending investors elsewhere in
the search for returns. Despite efforts by Brazil to weaken its
real currency, it hit a near two-year high this week.
 While China had been especially wary about the effort to
set up a monitoring process, it welcomed the G20 accord.
 Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said the
agreement ""fully reflects each country's demands,"" including
""reforming the international financial system and strengthening
financial regulation.""
 ""We're satisfied with the results,"" he said.
 Lena Komileva, an economist at Brown Brothers Harriman,
said officials were still a long way from securing the future
of the world economy.
 ""The global recovery has been achieved at the price of a
record U.S. budget deficit and overheating in emerging markets
such as China,"" she said. ""This is not a sustainable platform
for global economic stability.""

91,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2011 08:40PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-G20 turns spotlight on shortcomings of big economies," WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - At least seven of the
world's leading economies will undergo scrutiny of their
economic policies under a new plan to help prevent future
financial crises like the one of 2007-09.
 All Group of 20 countries will be judged on indicators such
as debt and budget deficits as well as trade and investment
flows, and may face reviews by the International Monetary Fund
which could lead to suggestions for policy fixes.
 At least seven major economies will automatically go into
the so-called second stage reviews, based on their size.
 Those nations are the United States, China, Japan, Germany,
Britain, France and India, according to G20 officials.
 Any policy fixes suggested by the IMF will not be binding.
Instead the group hopes that peer pressure will work to smooth
out dangerous imbalances in the world economy.
 Below are summaries of the policy challenges in the seven
countries that will undergo automatic review.
 UNITED STATES
 The world's biggest economy's public debt has swelled to
more than 60 percent of annual economic output. With a budget
deficit of about 10 percent of output, it will grow further.
 The Obama administration is likely to respond to any G20
calls for fiscal discipline by pointing to its newly announced
plans to hack $4 trillion from the budget deficit over the next
12 years through spending cuts and tax hikes on the rich.
 The IMF has cast doubt about Washington's ability to meet a
previous goal of halving its deficit by 2013, and his current
goal announced this week is to reduce the deficit to 2.5
percent of gross domestic product by 2015.
 What Washington most wants from the G20 process is to get
China to rely more on domestic consumption and less on exports,
a move that would open up opportunities for U.S. business.
 CHINA
 China, now the world's No. 2 economy, this week reported
its foreign-exchange reserves topped $3 trillion. In the years
leading up to the financial crisis, much of this cashpile was
invested in Western markets and helped fuel excessive
risk-taking by banks. That in turn led to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression.
 The United States claims China saves too much and spends
too little because it keeps the yuan undervalued against the
dollar, thus aggravating Washington's trade deficit.
 China has said repeatedly it will only let the yuan rise
gradually -- it's up more than 4 percent against the dollar
since mid-2010 -- and has expressed skepticism about the G20
guidelines, seeing them as one more form of Western pressure.
 The G20 communique said the new policy mechanism would take
""due account"" of exchange rates among other policies, appearing
to give China room to keep the yuan off the table.
 JAPAN
 Japan will come under scrutiny for its huge current account
surplus, which stands at around 3 percent of its total economy.
Tokyo probably won't object to any peer review process as it
can argue that the surplus will soon take care of itself.
That's because an aging population will lead to a falling
savings rate and reduce the amounts that Japanese investors
have available to invest overseas. Japanese officials have said
submitting to a review may also be helpful in nudging China
into doing the same.
 GERMANY
 With all the focus on China, Germany often slips beneath
the radar when talk turns to export-driven economies. The
country ran a surplus on its current account, the broadest
possible measure of trade and investment flows, of about 5.3
percent of output last year, though the IMF sees that dipping a
bit this year.
 Subjecting Germany to an in-depth review may be complex as
Europe's position is that the entire 17-country euro zone
should be examined if any of its members are named.
 From that angle, Germany's situation will look more benign,
as its surpluses and those of other northern European countries
would offset deficits in countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece
and Ireland, leaving the euro zone largely in balance and
reducing the likelihood of any calls for policy fixes.
 BRITAIN
 Britain's biggest challenge is its budget deficit, which
jumped above 9 percent of gross domestic product on an
internationally comparable basis in the 2009/10 fiscal year. A
rapidly rising debt-to-GDP ratio and high private sector
indebtedness are also likely to spark concern.
 However, Britain's finance minister, George Osborne,
welcomed the possibility of closer scrutiny by the IMF on
Friday. Britain's coalition government of Conservatives and
Liberal Democrats, which came to power in May 2010, blames the
previous Labour administration for the hefty deficit, and set
out a five-year plan to largely eliminate the budget deficit in
an emergency budget a month after taking office. The scale of
the cuts is likely to provide London with a strong case to make
to the rest of the G20 that it is dealing with its problems,
even if they are unpopular among voters at home.
 FRANCE
 France, the euro zone's second-largest economy, has made
curbing a ballooning debt one of its top priorities and is
battling to bring down its budget deficit from 7 percent last
year to a target of 5.7 percent in 2011. One of the world's
most generous welfare systems has helped fuel a quadrupling of
France's debt since the 1970s and the OECD forecasts it will
stabilize at around 90 percent of GDP in the coming years.
France will probably have to take tough measures to meet its
medium-term deficit commitments, an unpalatable prospect with
presidential elections due next year. High labor taxes and
growth in real wages have also made French exports less
competitive, leading to a widening trade deficit.
 INDIA
 With a current account deficit that the IMF projects will
hit 3.7 percent of GDP this year, India stands out for the
wrong reason: it has the largest deficit as a share of GDP
among the seven countries the G20 will examine.
 Its 8.2 percent economic growth rate forecast for this year
puts it up there with the best of the fast-growing ""BRICS""
economies, which have led the global economy out of recession.
But India has not been able to match China's progress in
pulling its population out of poverty.
 India, however, may score better than China when it comes
to the G20's review of exchange rate flexibility. The rupee is
partially convertible.

"
93,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2011 08:08PM ET</span>",Q+A-G20 agrees how to apply crisis-detection system," WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - The world's developed and
emerging economic powers agreed on a procedure for identifying
countries whose policies pose a threat to global stability.
 All Group of 20 countries would face tests, based on
previously agreed parameters, of their economies' health. But
seven that each account for 5 percent or more of total G20
output would get special scrutiny.
 The seven are China, the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Japan and India. The seven are most likely to be
kicked into a second of analysis, though that level of review
could be applied to any G20 member whose policies are found to
be troubling.
 The new system is not binding, relying instead on peer
pressure to persuade countries to voluntarily alter policies
seen as putting the world economy at risk.
 In February, the G20 wrangled over which indicators to
monitor, with China opposed to inclusion of foreign exchange
issues, but agreed on three broad parameters:
 1) Public debt and fiscal deficits
 2) Private savings and private debt
 3) Trade interactions, including the merchandise trade
balance and net investment flows.
 The step forward in Washington was to agree on ""indicative
guidelines"" for assessing economies on each of the three
parameters.
 Following are some questions and answers on how the G20
arrived at this point and where it hopes to go from here.
 WHERE DID THE IDEA OF INDICATIVE GUIDELINES COME FROM?
 After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, policymakers began
searching for ways to make the world economy more stable.
 They quickly identified mounting trade deficits in
countries like the United States and corresponding surpluses in
others like China as one key source of instability.
 The United States' claim that China's undervalued currency
was a reason for out-of-kilter trade, and China's retort that
the United States was to blame for overconsumption, produced
argument and little action.
 So G20 political leaders agreed in November to launch an
effort to find a set of indicators that could be used to assess
each economy without necessarily singling out one or two.
 WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO GET THIS PROCESS IN PLACE?
 Because each nation faces unique circumstances, it's easy
for countries to argue that certain criteria do not apply to
them.
 At the February meeting of the G20 in Paris, China refused
to agree that currency exchange rates were an acceptable gauge
because Beijing felt it would lead to more pressure to let the
yuan rise in value.
 China, now the world's No. 2 economy, says it is still a
developing country and will allow more currency flexibility but
only at a controlled pace that does not cause disruption.
 Similarly, there was disagreement over a proposal to use
current account balances, which include capital flows as well
as merchandise trade flows, as a gauge of imbalances.
 China, as the largest holder of foreign currency thanks its
surging exports, was sensitive about being assessed on its huge
current account surplus that includes interest earnings on
nearly $3 trillion of accumulated foreign exchange reserves.
 SO WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED AT THIS MEETING?
 The G20 agreed on how to apply four methods for measuring
members' performance -- three of them statistical approaches
that weigh past and projected growth estimates or that
benchmark a country's economy against others, and one a
structural approach that uses computer modeling to adjust for
special circumstances such as whether a country is primarily a
commodity producer.
 All four methods will be applied against each country's
economy. That was a compromise since there was argument whether
any single method could reliably be used to measure such a
diverse set of economies.
 WHAT HAPPENS IF ECONOMY SHOWS IMBALANCES?
 If at least two of the four approaches identify a country
as having persistently large imbalances, that would trigger
stage two of the process: an in-depth assessment with the help
of the International Monetary Fund to examine the nature and
causes of the imbalances and to devise policy prescriptions.
 This stage is expected to occur over the summer and to be
largely completed by fall, ready for full implementation ahead
of a meeting of G20 political leaders in Cannes on Nov. 3-4,
capping France's year as G20 president.
 WHEN WILL WE KNOW WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE IMBALANCES?
 That's unclear at this point, although U.S. officials said
it should happen fairly soon. It is not entirely clear that the
G20 will publish a list of countries sent to a second stage of
review although it would likely soon become known.
 The seven big economies that would almost automatically go
to the second stage are considered ""systemic economies"" -- so
big that they could hurt the global financial system if they
failed to change policy course.
 WON'T NATIONAL INTERESTS SUPERSEDE ANY VOLUNTARY PACT?
 It remains to be seen whether parties will bow to peer
pressure if altering a policy, such as reducing a trade surplus
or deficit, would hurt some sectors of its economy. But there
were at least some promising indications.
 China had warned before the G20 meeting that it wouldn't
agree to anything that looked like a ""political tool"" to rein
in its trade surpluses, which would mean allowing the yuan to
rise more rapidly.
 But China's vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, said after
the meeting that everyones' views had been accommodated and
that China was satisfied. The United States said it was
committed to cutting its budget deficits -- the parameter
likely to cause it to be labeled as needing a policy change --
so there was some reason for optimism that key countries could
accept policy prescriptions as long as they were broadly in
line with sovereign aspirations.

 By Solarina Ho
 TORONTO, April 15 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened
marginally against the U.S. dollar on Friday, but remained
within a narrow range as the spotlight was directed on
sovereign debt fears in Europe.
 Euro-zone debt concerns warred with expectations of a rate
hike by a hawkish European Central Bank, with volatility in the
euro heightened on Friday by a ratings downgrade on Ireland to
just above ""junk"" status. [FRX/] [ID:nLDE73E0DU]
 ""It's more of a story of what's going on outside of
Canada,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD
Securities, noting that the underlying trend was still toward a
higher Canadian dollar, even if it was not significantly higher
than current levels.
 ""It's a bit of a range trade. There's probably a short-term
bias for a bit of a correction in the rundown for USD/CAD in
the last month or so. It probably means no more than a bounce
to C$0.9700 or C$0.9750.""
 The currency  finished the week at C$0.9601 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.0416, down slightly from Thursday's North
American finish of C$0.9598 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0419.
That followed a low of C$0.9650, or $1.0363 touched earlier in
the session.
 ""I don't think foreign investors are really overly
concerned to be honest,"" said David Bradley, director of
foreign exchange trading at Scotia Capital.
 ""It feels as though with USD/CAD, anytime we test above
C$0.9650 it seems there's plenty of selling interest. I think
there's still a lot of sovereign interest to buy Canadian
dollars out there as well.""
 The commodity-linked Canadian dollar was still finding

 With next week's domestic inflation data not expected to be
a major driver for the currency -- the core inflation outlook
remains low -- analysts expect the Canadian dollar to react to
big U.S. dollar trends and a risk appetite that could be
influenced by outside factors including the European debt
crisis, equity markets and commodity prices.

 Canadian government bond prices were firmly higher across
the curve, shadowing movement in U.S. Treasury prices.
Investors were increasingly bullish on the near term outlook,
helped by still-benign inflation on both sides of the border.

 NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - Global stocks and crude oil
rose on Friday as better-than-expected economic reports and
improving U.S. consumer confidence eased concerns about rising
fuel costs even as gold hit a record high on inflation fears.
 U.S. Treasury debt gained after government data showed
underlying U.S. inflation pressures remained subdued and a
survey said consumers were more restrained in their long-term
inflation outlook. For details see: [ID:nN15273289]
 Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and
energy costs, edged up a less-than-expected 0.1 percent in
March while consumer inflation expectations for the next five
to 10 years fell, boding well for fixed-income prices.
[ID:nN15209781]
 But gold prices rose 1 percent to a record as a rally in
crude oil and a downgrade of Ireland's sovereign debt powered
bullion toward its fifth consecutive weekly gain.
 Spot gold  hit a record $1,487.90 an ounce but
remained far below its all-time inflation-adjusted high of
almost $2,500 an ounce in 1980.
 Wall Street rallied but the market is set to climb a wall
of worry next week when more than one-fifth of S&P 500
companies report results. Disappointing results from Bank of
America  and Google  late Thursday kept gains in
check.
 ""I'm surprised the market is holding up so well, given
Google and Bank of America. But everyone is happy with the
consumer price number,"" said Randall Warren, chief investment
officer of Warren Financial Service in Exton, Pennsylvania.
 ""People were afraid that inflation could derail the bull
market, and this data puts that story on hold.""
 Other data showed industrial capacity use jumped in March
to its highest level since August 2008 while manufacturing
activity in New York state was better than expected, easing
worries about slower growth. [ID:nN15215603] [ID:nDYE7EA02G]

 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 nations
agreed on Friday on a way to measure the potential risks to the
global economy posed by national economic policies as part of a
plan to avoid a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
 Countries representing more than 5 percent of the combined
gross domestic product of the G20 will be subject to a deeper
second-stage analysis of imbalances in their economy, G20
finance officials said in a communique.
 France said it would be on that list, which would certainly
pull in the United States, China, Germany and Japan as well.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said seven countries
in all would face heightened policy scrutiny.
 The G20 said it would take into account the exchange rates
and monetary policy frameworks of its member nations.
 While the biggest G20 members would automatically face
in-depth analysis, all members of the G20 emerging and
developed nations would be subject to the monitoring
mechanism.
 The communique, however, appeared to offer some room for
countries to avoid tough policy prescriptions. ""National
circumstances will ... be taken into account,"" the communique
said without elaboration.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Friday
but its uptrend of the past three months still looks intact,
with the prospect of more interest rate rises from the European
central bank seen offsetting concerns about the ability of some
poorer euro zone countries to pay their debts.
 The euro is up nearly 8.0 percent against the U.S. dollar
and 10.4 percent versus the yen in 2011, helped by interest
rate differentials with the the short end of the euro zone
yield curve significantly above the U.S. yield curve,
 Inflation accelerated in Europe and Asia in March while the
United States bucked the global trend with underlying price
pressures largely in check, leaving monetary policy set by the
ECB and the Federal Reserve diverging paths [ID:nL3E7FF17].
 ""You have two central banks with two different monetary
policy stances, with the euro the clear winner in this interest
rate game,"" said Bruce McCain, senior vice president and chief
investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio.
 ""The concern is rising oil and commodity prices and I fear
that consumers will get spooked enough to dramatically lower
spending, which will make U.S. economic growth even weaker.""
 That could push Federal Reserve interest rate rises even
further down the road, he said.
 ""We are bearish on Treasuries and prefer to maintain a
minimal position,"" McCain said.
 The ECB raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent
from 1.0 percent last week, its first rate hike since July
2008, but many economists believe the Fed will not raise rates
until early in 2012. Investors are pricing in the chances of
two more ECB rate increases before the end of this year
.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro  was
down 0.4 percent at $1.4432, off a 15-month high of $1.4521
touched earlier this week. The euro was down about 0.3 percent
this week.
 However, Deutsche Bank said the euro looks capable of
extending its gains to near $1.50, or 30 percent above
purchasing power parity (PPP).
 History shows that an overvaluation of 30 percent would
give a clear bearish euro signal for the subsequent 12 months
and typically, the euro corrects by 10 percent once a 30
percent overvaluation is reached, the bank said.
 ""With the first quarter behind us, it is now evident the
clearest trend has been euro strength; not only did it go up
almost continuously, the euro outperformed all other G10
currencies.""
 ""The near-term picture remains fairly positive for the
euro. But the strength of performance alone suggests that the
euro will struggle to outperform over the next quarters, while
medium-term drivers suggest it is too late to jump on to the
uptrend,"" the bank said.
 The U.S. dollar slipped 0.5 percent against the yen though
on Friday to aroun d83.12 yen . The yen has risen in six
of the last seven sessions and was on track for best weekly
performance against the dollar in about nine months with gains
this week of 2.1 percent.
 US DOLLAR STILL VULNERABLE
 The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, remains vulnerable to the risk
that the U.S. Congress may not raise the limit on the
government's debt ceiling before the limit is hit around May
16.
 ""The USD dodged the 2011 budget bullet last weekend and is
now facing the debt ceiling cannonball,"" said Steven Englander,
head of G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 The U.S. Congress on Thursday approved a budget deal to
avert a government shutdown, but mass defections in both
parties highlighted the difficult fights ahead on spending and
debt reduction [ID:nLDE73E02R].
 Foreign exchange markets are increasing the attention they
pay to fiscal sustainability relative to monetary policy,
Englander said.
 ""The USD will be in big trouble if investors get the sense
that the debt ceiling negotiations have gone beyond the
expected choreography into a zone where there is perceived risk
to US credit.""
 ""The FX response may be non-linear so G10 countries may
have a false sense of security in seeing little FX response to
deterioration so far,"" he said.

 By Jan Strupczewski
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - A Greek debt restructuring
is not in the cards because it would not help solve Greece's
economic problems and it would hurt the euro zone, the EU
economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, said on
Friday.
 Rehn said that a debt sustainability analysis of Greece, to
be started in May, would show what new steps the country would
need to take to reach deficit and debt reduction goals agreed
with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 ""Restructuring is not part of the plan, it is not in the
cards,"" Rehn told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of
the G20 meeting of financial leaders of the world's 20 biggest
economies.
 ""It would neither be necessary, nor help Greece to overcome
its economic difficulties as Greece needs reform and reform is
the essential part of the programme,"" he said.
 ""Nor would it be beneficial to the euro area. It would
actually be quite detrimental to Europe,"" he said.
 German Deputy Foreign Minister Werner Hoyer, a member of
the junior coalition party Free Democrats (FDP) was quoted on
Friday as saying that a Greek debt restructuring ""would not be
disaster.""
 If Greece's creditors agreed that talks with Athens ""would
be helpful toward a restructuring of the debt, then of course
this would be supported by us,"" news agency Bloomberg quoted
Hoyer as saying.
 Rehn commented that ""This is that kind of moment when we
have to ... practice rigorous verbal discipline -- it is a
precondition for overcoming the latest stage of the crisis.""
 Rehn stressed that Greece must quickly move forward on its
privatisation programme, which envisages state asset sales of
50 billion euros by 2015, with 15 billion euros to be raised in
the first two years.
 ""The privatisation programme will be very important for the
debt sustainability analysis,"" he said.
 ""We take the Greeks by their word that they intend to
privatise 15 billion euros in the first two years and 50
billion euros altogether by 2015, which represents 22 percent
of GDP of Greece -- in fact around 1/6th of the current debt
burden.""
 ""So alone, it will not solve the problem of Greece, but it
is a very significant part of the solution,"" Rehn said.
 Asked what would happen if the debt sustainability analysis
shows that Greek debt is unsustainable, Rehn said: ""Let's not
jump the gun. It is premature to draw conclusions before the
profound work has been done.""
 ""We first want to analyse all the factors having an impact
on debt sustainability, draw conclusions and only then will we
consider whether and how the policy conditionality of the
programme should be adjusted,"" Rehn said.
 Asked if he expected Greece would be able to return to
markets to borrow next year, as planned, Rehn said, ""I am aware
of the challenges Greece is facing, including the challenge of
returning to the markets, but it is premature to judge this at
this stage.""
 He noted that while in the first year of the Greek
programme the main burden of adjustment was on the Greek
finance minister, now all cabinet members had to lend their
full support to the structural reforms Greece had to undergo.
 ""Now the scope has to be widened, so that the whole
government, each and every minister and civil servant, are
fully engaged in implementing the programme and doing the
necessary structural reforms,"" Rehn said.

(Adds details from more G20 sources)
 By Gernot Heller and Jan Strupczewski
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Finance chiefs from the
world's big economies agreed on Friday on a plan for
identifying countries whose policies could put the global
economy at risk if left unchecked, Group of 20 sources said.
 Under the agreement, data on debt, borrowing and trade
balances will be plugged into computer models to determine if a
country's practices should come under special scrutiny.
 A G20 official said the group has a good idea which
countries will merit extra attention but they will not be named
in a communique detailing the deal later on Friday.
 The officials also agreed to keep working on a framework
covering when countries can use controls over capital inflows
-- a sensitive topic for emerging market nations that have seen
huge inflows of ""hot money"" from countries like the United
States where interest rates are low.
 Brazil, an important player in the group of developing and
rich economies, had pushed back hard against any effort to
restrict the use of capital controls, but sources said it had
softened its opposition.
 As the major forum for global policy coordination, the G20
wants to prevent the type of boom-and-bust cycle that led to
the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the worst global recession
since World War Two.
 The hope is to rebalance a world in which some countries,
notably the United States, are heavy consumers, while others,
such as China, depend on exports for growth.
 But it continues to be a struggle to fully agree how best
to do so now that the darkest days of crisis have passed.
 G20 economies that are particularly large are expected to
be face a second round of analysis under the process to
identify economic weak spots. Separately, any G2O country found
to be out of balance would also face more analysis.
 The G20 compromised in Paris in February on broad
indicators to use and now have agreed on using four types of
computer models to measure them, a G20 source said.
 Notwithstanding the agreement, the so-called ""indicative
guidelines"" will likely need considerable refinement before
they can be endorsed by G20 political chiefs at a fall meeting
in Cannes. France, this year's G2O host, has made the plan a
priority.
 Thorny patches are still ahead. China has voiced suspicion
that the effort is a U.S.-driven bid to get it let its yuan
currency appreciate more rapidly.
 According to one source, a country subjected to a further
analysis because of possible imbalances might face questions
whether it had an undervalued currency or had accumulated
excess foreign exchange reserves -- a characterization that
appeared to point at China. A top Chinese official said on
Friday the yuan would only be allowed to rise in value at a
speed Beijing sets.
 One potential shortcoming of the pact is that countries
will not be bound to follow any policy recommendations that
emerge. Instead, officials hope peer pressure brings change.
 Even as finance chiefs tried to look to the future,
Europe's acute debt problems demanded attention.
 European finance chiefs played down the idea that Greece
was on the verge of needing to restructure its debt, although
financial markets see it as virtually inevitable.
 GLOBAL DIVIDE
 The meetings in Washington once again exposed a divide
between big emerging economies, led by the group known as
BRICS, for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and
developed economies such as the United States.
 Leaders of the BRICS kept up their calls for a monetary
system less reliant on the U.S. dollar at a summit in China
this week.
 A cloudy outlook for global growth complicates efforts to
find unity about how to add stability to the economic system.
 High oil and food prices, the euro zone's sovereign debt
crisis, political infighting over the massive U.S. budget
deficit and the impact of Japan's earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis all pose risks to the recovery from recession.
 In addition to economic imbalances, G20 members were also
considering expansion of the IMF's accounting unit known as the
SDR, or Special Drawing Rights, to include more currencies.
 The SDR is made up of four currencies -- the U.S. dollar,
British pound, Japanese yen and the euro -- but some think
finding a way to add China's yuan would be a step toward giving
the SDR more profile as a potential future reserve currency, a
position now held by the dollar.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on Thursday
economies that represent 5 percent of total G20 output were
likely to merit special monitoring. That would include the
United States, China, France, Germany, Japan and possibly
others, such as Britain.

 NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - The euro succumbed to
sovereign debt fears on Friday, but the single-currency should
remain range-bound or even rebound against the dollar as loose
U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy goes head-to-head with a
hawkish European Central Bank.
 Peripheral sovereign debt concerns have mostly been
outweighed by rate expectations this year, but nevertheless the
euro has suffered from setbacks along the way, with Friday no
exception after Moody's cut Ireland's rating to just above
""junk"" status. [ID:nLDE73E0DU]
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro  was
down 0.4 percent at $1.4436, well below a 15-month high of
$1.4521 touched earlier this week. The euro was down about 0.3
percent so far this week.
 Traders said market ran stop orders below $1.4430, pushing
the euro to session lows at $1.4407 on electronic trading
platform EBS.
 The options market suggests euro zone debt worries are not
at the forefront of investors' minds. Benchmark volatilities
implied by one-month at-the-money euro/dollar options 
was around 9.35 percent on Friday, near a one-year low.
 Six-month  and one-year implied vols 
remained elevated though, trading at 11.45 percent and 12.25
percent respectively.
 Several top Federal Reserve officials have sounded
reassuring about inflation, and data on Friday supported that
stance. For Fed comments, click on [ID:nN14167673].
 Data showed U.S. core consumer prices for March were

 To many economists the data affirmed expectations that the
Fed would not raise rates until early next year.
 The ECB. meanwhile, raised rates to 1.25 percent from 1
percent last week, its first rate hike since July 2008.
 Euro zone inflation numbers surprised on the upside,
reinforcing views the ECB will continue to raise rates in the
coming months. [ID:nBRLFFE7CY]
 ""A year from now, the ECB may have navigated the exit from
accommodative policies, at the point at which the FOMC (Federal
Open Market Committee) will be about to raise rates,"" said Jens
Larsen, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in
London.
 ""If the ECB hike does not cause a significant slowing of
growth in the euro area, or a sharp deterioration in the
periphery, then the pre-emptive strategy may well be judged
successful.""
 Investors are pricing in the chances of two more ECB rate
increases before the end of this year .
 ""The interest rate differential argument has clearly
supported the euro the last few weeks,"" said Greg Salvaggio,
senior vice president for capital markets at Tempus Consulting
in Washington.
 ""The ECB has hiked rates and will probably hike again by
the end of the summer and now the question is what will the Fed
do. Clearly this benign inflation data that we got this morning
won't push the Fed quickly to hike rates.""
 Market players said the euro could find the going tough
above $1.45 given concerns about sovereign debt problems, which
escalated this week as fears about a possible Greek
restructuring intensified. [ID:nLDE73D0XQ]

 By Gernot Heller and Jan Strupczewski
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - The world's big economies
agreed on Friday on a plan for identifying countries whose
policies could put the global economy at risk if left
unchecked, a Group of 20 source said on Friday.
 The outline will be made public in a communique later on
Friday. It was unclear whether specific countries deemed large
enough to merit special attention would be named now or later.
 The G20 group of rich and emerging economies has been
struggling to come up with a process that will help lay a
foundation for global growth less prone to the booms and busts
of recent decades.
 Top finance officials were huddling behind closed doors to
flesh out the complicated plan, which would use a range of
economic and financial indicators to gauge when policies were
leading to a buildup of risk.
 The idea is to help rebalance a world economy in which some
countries, most notably the United States, are overly large
consumers, while others, such as China, lean heavily on exports
for growth.
 The so-called ""indicative guidelines"" will likely need
considerable refinement before they can be endorsed by G20
political chiefs at a fall meeting in Cannes. France, this
year's G2O host, has made the plan a priority.
 Thorny patches are still ahead. China has voiced suspicion
that the effort is a U.S.-driven bid to get it let its yuan
currency appreciate more rapidly. A top Chinese official said
on Friday the yuan would only be allowed to rise in value at a
speed Beijing sets.
 Getting the G20 to agree how to spot and fix dangers to
global growth is a considerable feat given the array of other
immediate threats -- high oil prices, huge debts in some rich
nations and unrest in the Middle East.
 But as the major forum for global policy coordination, the
G20 wants to insulate the economy from some of the imbalances
that led to the 2007-2009 crisis and the worst global recession
since World War Two.
 However, it has become hard to find agreement on just how
to reform the world's financial system now that the darkest
days of the financial crisis have passed.
 One potential shortcoming of the imbalances pact is that
countries will not be bound to follow any policy
recommendations that emerge. Instead, officials hope peer
pressure brings about needed changes.
 Even as finance chiefs tried to look to the future,
Europe's acute debt problems demanded attention.
 European finance chiefs played down the idea that Greece
was on the verge of needing to restructure its debt, although
financial markets see it as virtually inevitable.
 GLOBAL DIVIDE
 The meetings in Washington once again exposed a divide
between big emerging economies, led by the group known as
BRICS, for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and
developed economies such as the United States.
 Leaders of the BRICS kept up their calls for a monetary
system less reliant on the U.S. dollar at a summit in China
this week.
 South African President Jacob Zuma, speaking in China,
blasted the United States for its super-loose monetary policies
and over-spending, which he said threatened the world economy.
 The Federal Reserve's $2 trillion bond-buying program,
designed to stimulate the U.S economy, has been blamed by
emerging economies for driving down the dollar's value and
unleashing destabilizing waves of ""hot money"" into emerging
markets in search of higher yields.
 A cloudy outlook for global growth complicates efforts to
find unity about how to add stability to the economic system.
 High oil and food prices, the euro zone's sovereign debt
crisis, political infighting over the massive U.S. budget
deficit and the impact of Japan's earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis all pose risks to the recovery from recession.
 In addition to trying to secure a deal on guidelines for
economic imbalances, G20 members were also considering
expansion of the IMF's accounting unit known as the SDR, or
Special Drawing Rights, to include more currencies.
 The SDR is made up of four currencies -- the U.S. dollar,
British pound, Japanese yen and the euro -- but some think
finding a way to add China's yuan would be a step toward giving
the SDR more profile as a potential future reserve currency, a
position now held by the dollar.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on Thursday
the biggest economies -- those representing 5 percent of total
G20 output -- might get special scrutiny under the effort to
monitor risky policies. That would include the United States,
China, France, Germany, Japan and possibly others, such as
Britain.
 The G20 was also discussing how to apply guidelines. That
might be done through computer modeling, with sources telling
Reuters four different models for identifying imbalances were
being discussed.
 Reducing budget deficits is crucial too. The IMF this week
said the United States may have a hard time meeting a G20 goal
of halving its deficit by 2013.
 President Barack Obama presented a plan this week to cut
the deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years, but his former
economic adviser said the country should wait until after
growth is strong enough to warrant higher interest rates.

 * U.S. bond fund outflow of $159 mln, first in nine weeks
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks and
bonds, for the first time this year, took in more cash than
their developed market counterparts in the week ended April 13,
fund-tracker EPFR Global said on Friday.
 EPFR reasoned that rising energy prices, a mixed start to
first quarter corporate earnings reports, Portugal's sovereign
debt problems and Japan's ongoing nuclear crisis all combined
to drive investors away from developed markets.
 In the latest week, emerging market equity funds took in
just over $2 billion. The broadest category, known as GEM
(global emerging market) funds had net inflows of $1.64
billion.
 That is in contrast to the $356 million in net redemptions
from U.S. equity funds and a $293 million outflow from Japanese
equity funds. Japanese funds have suffered three weeks of net
outflows. The severity of the nuclear disaster was upgraded to
its highest level, matching the disaster at Chernobyl.
 ""In contrast to the previous week, when 22 of the 25 major
fund groups tracked by EPFR Global posted inflows, only 15 took
in fresh money during the week ending April 13,"" the firm said
in a statement.
 ""Money market funds absorbed the lion's share, taking in a
nine week high of $10.37 billion versus $3.2 billion for all
equity funds and $531 million for bond funds,"" EPFR said.
 Russia continues to be a bright spot among the BRIC
(Brazil, Russia, India, China) category, as it benefits from
high energy prices. EPFR said inflows into Russia - $262
million - marking the 26th out of the last 28 weeks although
some fund managers are starting to question valuations.
 Brazil, India and China had outflows of $89 million, $29
million, and $116 million, respectively. Dedicated BRIC funds
managed just $5 million worth of inflows.
 The capital controls instituted by Brazil to temper
speculative money flows and the surge to the front in Peru's
first round presidential election last weekend by left-wing
nationalist Ollanta Humala contributed to a $163 million
outflow for Latin America focused funds, EPFR said.
 Not everyone is convinced Humala is necessarily marking a
sell signal on Peru. For more, click on [ID:nN14283353].
 On the more speculative side, frontier market funds had
outflows of $31 million.
 Japan's nuclear crisis was seen as a positive for South
Korean exporters and as a result funds focused on this north
Asia nation took in a net $175 million.
 One bright spot for developed markets was the $1.25 billion
net inflow for developed European equity funds.
 ""Behind the overall number, however, was a big shift away
from regional funds to those concentrating on Germany with
strong institutional commitments helping Germany equity funds
post their biggest weekly inflow since the second week of May,
2010,"" EPFR said.
 German funds took in a net $2.46 billion, with most of the
cash flowing into a few large exchange traded funds.
 Emerging Europe, defined as EMEA funds (Europe, Middle
East, and Africa) had a modest net inflow of $67 million.
 SECTOR FUNDS
 Higher energy prices and the start of earnings season put a
damper on sector funds. Even as oil and gas prices remain
elevated, net redemptions from a single large energy-focused
ETF led to a net outflow of $1.14 billion from energy sector
funds overall. It was the worst week since the third quarter of
2008.
 EPFR said higher interest rates, insurance costs related to
Japan and uncertainty over financial regulation led to a $320
million outflow from financial sector stock funds.
 Real estate however took in $245 million while the
defensive healthcare/biotechnology sector had a paltry $9
million worth of inflows.
 DEBT
 Emerging markets outshone developed markets, with an inflow
from retail investors driving the four-week trend.
 Local currency bond funds had inflows of $210 million; hard
currency, ie: those denominated in U.S. dollars or euros took
in a net $238 million.
 On the developed market side, U.S. bond funds had outflows
of $159 million, their first in nine weeks. One main cause for
this outflow was the continued pulling out of cash by retail
investors from the municipal bond market. Retail investors make
up 80 percent of the market, EPFR noted.
 ""The possibility that this asset class could lose its
federal tax-exempt status as part of the latest push to tame
the US deficit has trumped encouraging news about default rates
and a sharp drop in new issuance,"" the firm said.
 Europe's debt crisis was seen behind a $946 million
outflow.
 However, the hunt for returns pulled fresh cash into high
yield bond funds, to the tune of $726 million, bringing the
year-to-date inflow to $17.7 billion..

(Updates throughout with White House aide comments)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - The Obama administration
is making a big push to get Russia into the World Trade
Organization by the end of the year and to persuade Congress to
approve permanent normal trade relations with the former Cold
War enemy, a top White House official said on Friday.
 ""It's not a gift to Russia. We think it's in our national
interest,"" White House national security official Michael
McFaul said in a speech at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics.
 Getting Russia in the WTO and establishing PNTR ""is the top
priority in our entire bilateral relation,"" he said.
 Russia, the largest economy still outside the WTO, has been
negotiating for about 18 years to join the world body.
 Helping Russia to complete those negotiations would boost
economic ties, which have not made as much progress as other
issues under a ""reset"" of the relationship, McFaul said.
 The United States needs Russia's cooperation on a number of
geopolitical issues, including those concerning Iran.
 Stronger U.S. economic ties with Russia would make it
easier for Moscow to see the benefits of siding with
Washington, McFaul said.
 Once Russia has finished its accession to the WTO, Congress
would be required to approve PNTR by removing it from a human
rights provision known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment.
 That 1974 law tied normal trade relations with communist
countries to the rights of religious minorities to emigrate
freely. The White House has waived the measure each year since
1994, but it remains on the book.
 McFaul acknowledged President Barack Obama cannot
realistically ask lawmakers to approve PNTR until there is a
final WTO accession deal. But the administration wants Congress
to vote as soon as possible after a final deal, he said.
 SETTING THE TONE
 A draft study released by the Peterson Institute on Friday
estimated U.S. goods exports to Russia could double to $19
billion after Russia joins the World Trade Organization.
 But it warned U.S. exporters could lose sales if Congress
refuses to grant PNTR to keep pressure on Moscow to improve its
human rights record or address other concerns.
 Consequently, ""the U.S. congressional vote on extending
permanent normal trade relations could set the tone for
economic relations between the United States and Russia for the
next decade to come,"" the report said.
 McFaul and Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kurdin, in a
separate speech earlier on Friday, said Russia was very close
to finishing its accession process. That could set the stage
for a congressional vote in coming months.
 Russia's WTO entry would create export opportunities for
U.S. poultry, pork and beef as well as other items such as
wine, fruits and nuts, the report said.
 U.S. drug and medical device manufacturers also should
profit, as should exporters of heavy industrial machinery such
as tractors and oil and natural gas field equipment, it said.
 U.S. services companies in sectors ranging from
telecommunications to finance to express delivery also should
see increased business in Russia.
 Refusing to grant permanent normal trade relations to
Russia would put the United States at odds with a WTO rule
requiring members to ""unconditionally"" provide all other
members the same market access.
 Russia could respond by denying U.S. farmers and companies
the market-opening benefits of its accession to WTO, putting
them at a disadvantage to European, Chinese, and other
competitors.
 McFaul said he did not believe withholding PNTR would be an
effective way to pressure Moscow on human rights. Congress
should explore other avenues to do that, he said.

 * Decision likely next week - sources
(Adds detail)
 FRANKFURT, April 15 (Reuters) - One of the owners of German
public-sector bank Helaba is rushing to change the design of
part of its capital contribution to allow the lender to pass a
European bank health check.
 ""It is possible to make our silent participation fit for the
EBA (European Banking Authority) stress test by the April 30
deadline,"" Thomas Schaefer, Finance Minister of the regional
state of Hesse, which owns 10 percent of Helaba, said on Friday.
 According to two people close to Helaba's owners, Hesse
would next week change the design of its 1.9 billion euro silent
participation so it counts as hard capital, thus allowing Helaba
to pass the test. 
 The EBA has said it would let lower-quality capital -- such
as Helaba's silent participations -- count in the test if the
bank has already fully committed itself and publicly announced
measures by late April to swap them for equity or make them very
similar to it.
 Silent participations are a form of non-voting capital with
both debt and equity characteristics that have been criticised
by international regulators who fear they may not be available
to absorb losses when needed.
 Helaba and fellow landesbank NordLB both rely heavily on
such capital. They did not receive a state bailout in the
financial crisis, which has left them with a thinner capital
base than their peers WestLB, HSH Nordbank and LBBW, which did
get capital injections. 
 NordLB's owners decided earlier this week to swap silent
participation for equity and inject fresh cash so the bank would
be able to pass the stress test.
 Of Helaba's core capital of 5.75 billion euros, 3 billion
is made up of silent participations, of which 1.9 billion are
owned by the state of Hesse and 400 million euros by savings
banks, which own 85 percent of Helaba. 
 Hesse plans to change the design of its silent participation
to enable them to absorb losses in the same way equity does.
Bank regulators have come up with 14 criteria silent
participations need to comply with under Basel III, and it
already complies with 11 of them.
 The savings banks will in the medium term also change the
design of their silent participation, but this will take a
couple of months to organise, a person close to the municipally
owned lenders said.

 * Official demand tepid, private sector drives purchases
(Adds detail, comment, byline)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Foreigners tripled overall
purchases of U.S. securities in February, U.S. Treasury data
showed on Friday, but some large U.S. creditors cut government
bond holdings and demand for long-term assets slipped.
 Including short-dated assets such as bills, the United
States attracted a net inflow of $97.7 billion in February,
from a downwardly revised $30.6 billion inflow in January.
 Of that total, private investors took in a net $92.6
billion, nearly double their total for the prior month. The
official sector, which includes foreign central banks, showed a
net inflow of $5.1 billion. They were net sellers in January.
 However, net purchases of long-term U.S. assets, excluding
bills, moderated in Feburary to $26.9 billion, compared to a
downwardly revised $51.1 billion the prior month. Overall net
Treasury purchases fell to $30.6 billion from $46.4 billion.
 That partly reflects less buying by foreign central banks,
analysts said. Russia, for instance, trimmed Treasury holdings
for a fourth straight month to $130.5 billion. China, the top
foreign U.S. creditor, cut its huge stash by about $1 billion
to $1.154 trillion, also a fourth straight monthly reduction.
 Many export-led emerging market countries have amassed huge
U.S. dollar reserves in recent years, much of which they have
recycled into U.S. Treasuries. China this week reported its
foreign exchange reseves hit a record above $3 trillion.
 More recent data suggests many of those central banks have
been trying to diversify their dollar-heavy holdings, which
market anlaysts say may account for reduced inflows.
 ""The aggregate data and long-terminflows do not send an
inspiring picture for the U.S. dollar,"" said Alan Ruskin,
global head of currency strategy at Deutshe Bank.
 Recent signs of stronger U.S. growth and worries about the
country's fiscal deficit have pushed Treasury yields up in
recent months and may have also gave soured some investors on
longer-dated bonds.
 Ruskin conceded that U.S. government revisions in January
showing that China held nearly a third more in Treasury debt
than initially reported makes it hard to draw definitive
conclusiosn from the data.
 Still, ""none of the major components -- Treasuries,
agencies, corporate and equities -- showed any inflow vigor,""
which suggests more dollar losses ahead.
 The U.S. dollar has lost about 5.0 percent against a basket
of major currencies so far this year and is also weaker against
large emerging market currencies.
 Overases buyers cut purchases of U.S. equities by $9.9
billion to $6.1 billion in February and were net sellers of
corporate debt to the tune of $2.5 billion.
 Japan, the second largest foreign U.S. creditor, increased
Treasury holdings by $4.4 billion to $890.3 billion. But
analysts say next month's data for March may show a change, as
it will capture Japanese behavior after a devastating March 11
earthquake. Some in financial markets expected Japan might have
to cut back on Treasury buying to pay for repairs.

 NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - The euro slid on Friday
after Moody's cut Ireland's rating to just above 'junk' status,
keeping the currency's debt problems in focus, though it
remained underpinned by expectations for further interest rate
rises.

that. For Fed comments, click on [ID:nN14167673].
 Data showed U.S. core consumer prices for March were
contained, suggesting the Fed was still a long way away from
tightening monetary policy. The headline annual inflation rose
due to the spike in gasoline prices, but analysts considered
that rise temporary. See [ID:nOAT004787].
 In contrast, investors are pricing in the chances of two
more European Central Bank rate increases before the end of
this year after the ECB raised rates by 25 basis points last
week .
 ""The euro is in the middle of a tug-of-war between rate
expectations and sovereign debt concerns. Right now, the euro
pulled back a little bit because of the Ireland downgrade and
concerns about the Greek debt restructuring."" said Brian Kim,
currency strategist at UBS in New York.
 ""But we're still trading near $1.45. So in the end, it's
still rate expectations that will dictate direction and will
keep the euro supported.""
 In addition, euro zone inflation numbers surprised on the
upside, backing views that the ECB will continue to raise rates
in coming months. [ID:nBRLFFE7CY]

negative, citing an expected deterioration in the Irish

billion)
 By Steve Slater
 LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - Britain's top banks, grappling
with how to split future ""ring-fenced"" UK retail arms from
riskier investment banking operations, face a
multi-trillion-dollar dilemma: what goes in, what stays out?
 Under proposals from a UK panel looking at ways to shield
savers and taxpayers from a repeat of the global financial
crisis, banks must set up separate UK retail subsidiaries.
 The sheer size of Britain's top banks, whose balance sheets
dwarf its economy, and the global nature of the likes of HSBC
and Barclays, whose operations include extensive investment
banking operations, makes it a daunting prospect.
 The UK retail arms could cover over 2.5 trillion pounds
($4.1 trillion) of assets, or maybe just a third of that,
depending on what is included.
 But many details about the structure of those units and what
will go on to their books will only be clarified in six months
time.
 
 BASIC SERVICES
 Basic retail deposit taking will be included, and investment
banking services for big corporates will not.
 But what happens to businesses in between, such as payment
services, unsecured loans or dealings with small businesses, is
unclear.
 The final design will have a key bearing on how much it will
cost banks, how big a task the split will be and the scale of
the assets the UK taxpayer will be standing behind.
 The proposal will force the likes of Barclays, Royal Bank of
Scotland and HSBC to hold more capital for retail unit assets.
 It could also increase funding costs and squeeze profits.
 But the outcome should be less severe than having to wall
off their investment banks or being required to undergo a more
formal split.
 ""The Commission has come up with something that is
pragmatic,"" said Mike Trippitt, analyst at Oriel Securities.
 ""The essence of the report is adequate capitalisation and
some sort of segregation or ring-fencing ... anything else would
have been costly, massively disruptive and potentially
unworkable.""
 
 The Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) estimated banks
would have to garage a minimum of 15 percent of assets with the
retail unit, leaving 55 percent of assets outside the
ring-fence, notably capital markets services and activities by
big corporates. The remaining 30 percent could also be included.
 ""The devil is in the detail on how you ring-fence the retail
bank, as it's not clear,"" Trippitt said.
 The top five lenders could have to park 2.6 trillion pounds
($4,228 billion) of assets, almost twice the size of the UK
economy, based on their combined balance sheet of 5.75 trillion
pounds.
 But under a more restrictive definition of what needs to be
shielded, the amount could be less than 900 billion pounds.
 The ICB acknowledged its report left many questions
unanswered. Whether it will cover credit cards, wealth
management, riskier retail mortgages and most areas of business
banking remains uncertain.
 
 INTERACTION
 How the subsidiary can interact with other operations will
influence funding and be key to the cost of the plan, bankers
and analysts said.
 The cost will be well below the 12 billion pounds some
industry estimates have suggested, the ICB said.
 ICB Chairman John Vickers said the implications of the extra
costs would likely be reduced profitability, lower remuneration
for bankers and increased costs for customers.
 The ICB wants to make the ring-fence strong enough to shield
depositors if trouble flares up in other areas, and make it
easier to wind down the retail business if needed. But it wants
banks to benefit from some efficiency gains.
 ""Ideally, it would be possible for the rest of the group to
support the retail entity but not to jeopardise it, and vice
versa,"" the ICB's report said.

 * Sales may be lost if U.S. Congress stresses human rights
 * Administration wants 'adult conversation' with Congress
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - U.S. goods exports to
Russia could double to $19 billion after Russia joins the World
Trade Organization, according to a report urging the U.S.
Congress to permanently normalize trade with the former Cold
War enemy.
 But U.S. exporters could lose sales in Russia if Congress
refuses to grant ""permanent normal trade relations"" (PNTR) to
keep pressure on Moscow to improve its human rights record or
address other concerns, the Peterson Institute for
International Economics said on Friday in a policy brief.
 Consequently, ""the U.S. congressional vote on extending
permanent normal trade relations could set the tone for
economic relations between the United States and Russia for the
next decade to come,"" the report said.
 With Russia hoping to finish its accession process this
year, U.S. lawmakers could soon face a vote on the issue. The
Obama administration has made approval of PNTR one of its trade
priorities for 2011.
 President Barack Obama, as part of his efforts to improve
relations with Moscow, has pushed Russia to finish its bid to
join the WTO after more than 17 years of negotiation, and he is
pressing Congress to permanently normalize trade between the
two countries.
 That would require freeing Russia from the provisions of
the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment, a 1974 law that tied
normal trade relations with Communist countries to rights of
religious minorities to emigrate freely.
 Russia's WTO entry would create new export opportunities
for U.S. poultry, pork and beef as well as other food goods
such as wine, fruits and nuts, the report said.
 U.S. drug and medical device manufacturers also should
profit from Russia's membership in the WTO, as should exporters
of heavy industrial machinery such as tractors and oil and
natural gas field equipment, the report said.
 U.S. services companies in sectors ranging from
telecommunications to finance to express delivery also should
see increased business in Russia, it said.
 The United States established permanent normal trade
relations with China and Vietnam as those countries joined the
WTO. In the case of China, the measure followed years of debate
under the Clinton administration about China's human rights
record.
 WTO RULE
 Refusing to grant permanent normal trade relations to
Russia would put the United States at odds with a WTO rule
requiring members to ""unconditionally"" provide all other
members the same market access.
 Russia could respond by denying U.S. farmers and companies
the market-opening benefits of its accession to WTO, putting
them at a disadvantage to European, Chinese, and other
competitors eager for new export opportunities.
 Many members of Congress would like to see Russia join the
WTO but are wary of permanently normalizing trade relations
until they see the final details of the deal.
 Concerns about Moscow's record on human rights, its
repression of political dissent and its commitment to democracy
are also expected to figure into the debate.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said on Wednesday the
administration understands those concerns but wants to have an
""adult conversation"" with lawmakers about the consequences of
not approving permanent normal trade relations.

acquisition as it looks to expand its gas distribution network
ahead of a planned ramp-up in production.
 ""We are in active negotiations, conducting due diligence and
based on what we see in our due diligence we ought to be able to
structure a deal,"" chief executive Randeep Grewal said in an
interview on Friday.
 The potential target has gas distribution infrastructure in
a location to which Green Dragon wants access and will be worth
around $50 million depending on due diligence, said Grewal.
 Green Dragon is developing large coal bed methane resources
in China, where it believes it is the largest gas company not
owned by the state.
 ""Green Dragon will be profitable exiting 2013. Our
production is going to grow eighteen-fold,"" said Grewal, adding
the company planned to spend $250 million on a well drilling
programme over the next few years.
 Grewal said the company has $150 million of cash and could
look to raise additional funds when it seeks an additional
listing in Hong Kong, a long-stated aim.
 ""Assuming we get exchange approval we'd like to see
ourselves listed on the main board in Hong Kong prior to year
end,"" Grewal said.
 ""We need at least $100 million but depending on valuation we
may raise significantly more money than that, but it will really
depend on valuation.""
 Green Dragon plans to sell some of the gas it produces to
Chinese consumers at outlets where gas can be used to fuel
specially-converted cars, while the balance will be provided to
Chinese state majors such as PetroChina and Sinopec, said
Grewal.
 Green Dragon, which spun out its drilling operation in
February, currently has four retail outlets operating, and will
bring 24 more on stream by the end of this year, seeking to
further expand its network through acquisitions.
 Shares in Green Dragon, in which Grewal owns a 66 percent
stake, were flat at 12.4 pence at 1133 GMT, valuing the company
at $1.6 billion.

 * Rate differentials, sovereign buying offer support
 * Euro brushes off higher-than-expected euro zone CPI data
 
(Updates, adds details, quote)
 By Anirban Nag and Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday after
Moody's cut Ireland's rating to just above 'junk' status, keeping
the single currency zone's debt problems in the limelight,
though losses were likely to be offset by bids from sovereign
buyers.
 Also helping cap losses was the diverging outlook for
monetary policy in Europe and the United States. Several top
Federal Reserve officials have sounded relaxed about inflation,
bolstering the view the Fed is still some way from normalising
its ultra-loose monetary policy. [ID:nN14167673]
 The European Central Bank raised rates by 25 basis points
last week and investors are pricing in chances of two more rate
increases before the end of this year. 
 ""In the short term, interest rate differentials will still
be the key driver for the euro/dollar despite these downgrades
which have been priced in by the market,"" said Paul Robson,
currency strategist, at RBS Global Banking.
 ""The euro zone periphery is a key risk but unless ongoing
talk of recapitalisation of Spanish banks and Greek debt
restructuring come to a head, we will see rate differentials
support the euro.""
 Moody's cut Ireland's sovereign rating by two notches to
Baa3 and left the outlook negative, citing an expected
deterioration in the government's financial strength and a
weaker economic growth outlook. [ID:nLDE73E0DU]
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent on the day to $1.4460 ,
well below a 15-month high of $1.4521 touched earlier this week.
Traders said Asian central banks had bids at $1.4415/20 and then
at $1.4385/90.
 On the upside, an option barrier lies at $1.4525 and there
are stops above that level, going up to $1.4550, traders said.
 The euro showed little reaction to euro zone inflation
numbers which surprised on the upside, backing views that the
ECB will continue to raise rates in coming months.
[ID:nBRLFFE7CY]
 The dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 83.20 yen , but
losses were limited, with traders saying Japanese life insurance
companies have been buying the dollar and the euro at its lows
with stops in the dollar/yen pair building below 83 yen.
 The dollar was little changed versus a currency basket
<.DXY>.
 
 PERIPHERAL DEBT PROBLEMS
 Market players said the euro could find the going tough
above $1.45  given concern about sovereign debt problems,
which have escalated this week as concerns about a possible
Greek restructuring gather pace. [ID:nLDE73D0XQ]
 Some fund managers say an ongoing tightening in overall euro
zone monetary conditions, through interest rate rises and a
higher exchange rate, could stifle the economic recovery of
countries in the region which were saddled with massive debts.
 Ken Dickson, investment director of currencies at Standard
Life Investments in Edinburgh, said the euro was ""just too high""
in light of this issue, which would haunt the single currency in
the longer term.
 Still, the market was focused on whether Spain will need a
financial lifeline rather than addressing the impact of broader
fiscal issues in the region, he said, adding that Spain's
avoidance of a bailout for now was helping to bolster the euro.
 ""We're in a sell zone for the euro, but we're worried that
because the market is looking at Spain and not the others we
could extend the period where the euro appreciates and it could
remain overvalued for longer,"" Dickson said.
 ""Even though we have stronger views in the longer term, our
concerns about how far things can stretch in the near term have
meant that funds with shorter investment horizons have kept
positions light.""
 Standard Life manages 156.9 billion pounds ($256.7 billion)
in assets.
 Other asset managers took a different view of the euro, with
Japan's Kokusai Asset Management saying it plans to increase the
weighting of euro-denominated bonds in its $33 billion bond
fund, the world's second largest, due to a solid outlook for
euro zone economies. [ID:nL3E7FF0VV].
 Investors awaited a meeting of Group of 20 leaders in
Washington later in the day, which was expected to address
imbalances between export-reliant Asian countries led by China
and debt-laden Western countries led by the United States.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2011 07:40AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Interest rates back to fixate investors," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - Financial markets have swung
back into a new but familiar phase -- worrying about interest
rates -- and, not coincidently, the euro zone debt crisis is
also bubbling after a brief hiatus.
 It all points to a couple of weeks ahead that are likely to
be volatile -- risk-on, risk-off -- with a particular focus on
the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting on April 26.
 The interest rate issue is at its most obvious on the
foreign exchange market, where carry trading has returned.
Investors are borrowing in low-yielding currencies to invest in
higher-yielding ones.
 The euro, for example, is at its highest in 15 months
against the dollar.
 This is being driven by yield differentials now available
after the European Central Bank raised interest rates (with more
likely to come) while Japan keeps monetary conditions
ultra-loose following its devastating earthquake and tsunami.
 A sort of middle ground is being held by the Fed, which is
not likely to raise rates until next year, but which has to
decide on the future of its asset-buying quantative easing (QE)
programme, due to end in June.
 It is at this point that equity investors come into the
picture. QE has produced a flood of liquidity into markets that
has essentially driven investors into stocks, in part because it
has made a lot of fixed income unattractive.
 Equity markets have been remarkably resilient, shrugging off
just about everything that is being thrown at them, from
rocketing oil prices, wobbly euro zone debt, a big blow to
Japan's economy, and a revolt in the Arab world.
 Gary Baker, head of European equity strategy for Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch, says equity investors are actually
""reluctant bulls"" who can't fight Fed-driven liquidity.
 ""They see very little alternative to equities,"" he said.
 It all makes markets highly vulnerable to sudden, surprising
change. So any comments from the various factions in the U.S.
central bank hierarchy over the next few weeks may be even more
market-moving than usual.
 Flash PMIs from across the euro zone may also be signposts
to the ECB's next move.
 
 SPILLOVER
 Interest rate speculation is also playing into the euro zone
debt crisis, with the tighter ECB policy and strong euro doing
few favours for the struggling peripheral economies.
 This is most evident in Greece, where the spread between
10-year bonds and German equivalents is now more than 1,000
basis points and talk is rife of restructuring being needed.
 Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Friday that Greece
would present details of fresh austerity and privatisation plans
after Easter. They are an attempt to convince markets it can
tidy up its finances and avoid restructuring.
 Investors, however, continue to pressure peripheral debt,
despite various plans to draw a line under the problem.
Papandreou's announcement that details would come later did
little to ease concerns.
 Differing interest rate prospects, in the meantime, have
been a major catalyst behind the recent shift of investment
flows into emerging markets.
 Fears of tightening in red-hot emerging economies put some
investors off at the beginning of the year, but a belief that
the rate cycle was peaking opened the door to aggressive new
flows.
 Again, this makes markets particularly vulnerable to
surprises, epitomised by the risk-averse reaction to China's
increasing growth and higher consumer price inflation reported
in the past week.
 India also reported higher than expected inflation.
 The coming week brings central bank meetings in a number of
major emerging markets, notably Hungary, Brazil, Turkey, Israel
and Thailand.
 Turkey may be the most interesting as it will feature a
newly appointed central bank governor, Erdem Basci, widely seen
as the main architect of the country's unorthodox monetary
policy, which twins rate cuts with rises in bank reserve ratios
in order to tighten policy.
 
 MORE EARNINGS
 The remarkable performance of world equities, meanwhile,
will be tested in the coming week by the latest earnings season,
this time with Europe joining in with Wall Street.
 The U.S. reports will be dominated by banks, including
Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Europe will hear from
the likes of Novartis, LVMH and Peugeot.
 Europe may disappoint. Thomson Reuters StarMine data
suggests STOXX Europe 600 companies may post first-quarter
figures that will be on average 1 percent below expectations.
 Sentiment on the equity market nonetheless remains
constructive as seen in commodity trader Glencore's planned $12
billion initial public offering next month.

 BERLIN, April 15 (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Germany's ruling
coalition want parliament to have a say in determining the
country's contributions to the permanent fund being set up to
bail out struggling euro zone states from 2013.
 Financial markets are wondering how this dispensation, which
is enshrined in Germany's constitution and thus virtually
certain to be granted, might affect payments of emergency loans
from the fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
 Germany's lower house, the Bundestag, has the right of
consultation only over payments from the current euro zone
bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 The debate inside Germany is focused on whether
contributions into the ESM should face the same level of
scrutiny, be waved through automatically or be subject to a
potential parliamentary veto.
 In coming weeks, while negotiating a treaty over the fund
with other euro zone states, Berlin will also prepare a national
law to determine what role its parliament will play.
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he expected
parliament to review any funding requests, and Germany's Federal
Court of Auditors has recommended parliament have the same
oversight over the ESM as with the existing rescue fund.
 Following is an overview of the issues in play:
 
 PAYMENT INTO THE ESM FUND
 The Bundestag will vote on the entire ESM package, put
forward as a draft law, in accordance with its constitutional
role in budgetary issues. 
 All parties to the debate have ruled out approving any
package that could see Germany wind up with more than a planned
190 billion euros of total exposure to the ESM without giving
the Bundestag a say.
 Germany would also like to stretch out its 21.6 billion euro
contribution to the 80 billion euro capital base that forms the
core of the ESM.
 A question as to whether the law should specify the dates of
the payments, which would need to be accelerated in case of a
financial emergency, remains unanswered.

 NEW TOOLS FOR THE ESM?
 Unlike the EFSF, the ESM can be empowered in future with new
policy tools if all the finance ministers on its governing
council so decide.
 In theory, this means the ministers could eventually choose
to buy up sovereign debt in the secondary market using ESM funds
-- something the ruling German coalition parties reject.
 As a result, it is likely that parliament -- which is loath
to write the government a blank cheque -- will seek to have some
say in any decision that would expand the ESM's toolkit. 
 In this regard, representatives of all political persuasions
are demanding a binding parliamentary vote on the finance
ministers' decision-making powers.
 
 ESM ACTIVATION
 No troubled European state could seek the help of the ESM
without Germany's approval.
 But what needs to be clarified in the German ESM law is
whether the government would need to seek parliamentary approval
for every request for help.
 Options debated so far range from requiring simple
parliamentary consultation to binding parliamentary approval.
 
 WHO DECIDES WHAT?
 One possibility would be for the activation of the fund and
examination of terms for bailouts to be handled by the
Bundestag's powerful budget committee. Only fundamental changes
to the ESM would require approval of the entire chamber.
 In opposition to this stands the head of the lower house's
European committee, Gunther Krichbaum, who wants the full
Bundestag assembly to be involved in every aid request.
 Another proposal is to set up a special committee in which
delegates would be sworn to secrecy on sensitive financial
details from aid-seeking countries.

 A SAY FOR THE UPPER HOUSE?
 Things could get even more complicated. The finance minister
for the state of Bavaria, Georg Fahrenschon, has demanded that
the Bundesrat also have the right to reject ESM decisions due to
the impact they could have on the finances of Germany's regions.

 * Limited signs of building inflationary pressures in U.S.
 * Inflation higher than expected in China, India, eurozone
 * Governments under pressure to do more to rein in prices
 * Too much tightening risks slowing economic growth
 (Adds U.S. data)
 By Alan Wheatley and Lucia Mutikani
 BEIJING/WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Inflation
accelerated in Asia and Europe in March while the United States
bucked the global trend with underlying price pressures largely
in check, leaving monetary policy on diverging paths around the
world.
 The euro zone joined the rapidly developing economies this
month in raising interest rates to counter mounting price
pressures.
 In contrast, the Federal Reserve has shown no appetite to
raise U.S. rates before unemployment has declined further and
until the sluggish recovery is on a firmer footing. As a result
the Fed's super-cheap money is taking some of the blame for
fueling the commodity boom that is adding to inflation
pressures elsewhere.
 China and India reported higher-than-expected inflation on
Friday. Prices of oil and grains in particular are climbing
partly because strong economic growth in emerging market
economies has outstripped demand in the developed world since
the global financial crisis.
 The mounting price pressures reflect the price of some
commodities vaulting to record highs, with crude oil this month
at $120 a barrel also, stirring investor concerns about
inflation.
 ""The weakness in markets this week is expected after the
smart comeback we have seen recently, with inflationary
concerns again coming to the forefront,"" said Jan Lambregts,
global head of financial markets research at Rabobank.
[ID:nL3E7FF01Z]
 Consumer price inflation in China quickened to 5.4 percent
in the year to March, the fastest rate since July 2008, from
4.9 percent in the first two months of the year.
[ID:nL3E7FF0AC]
 In India, the Wholesale Price Index, the main inflation
gauge, rose 8.98 percent in the year to March, up from 8.31
percent in the 12 months to February and beating market
projections of an 8.36 percent reading.
 Economists expect the central banks of both countries to
tighten monetary policy further soon to dampen inflationary
pressure.
 A rise in the proportion of deposits that Chinese banks
must hold in reserve, rather than lend out, could be imminent
after Premier Wen Jiabao in midweek reaffirmed his
determination to keep a lid on prices.
 Core inflation, excluding food and energy, was the highest
in China in a decade. In India, too, a sharp upward revision to
figures for January has led some economists to the conclusion
that underlying price pressures are greater than they had
thought.
 ""It seems that inflation trajectory has changed. The
expected decline in inflation is just not happening and looks
like we have underestimated the underlying pressure on prices,""
said Ashutosh Datar, an economist at IIFL in Mumbai.
 ""More monetary tightening is inevitable after today's data
and the case for a 50 basis point hike in May is strengthened,""
he added.
 EURO ZONE AND U.S
 Final March figures for the euro zone showed inflation
jumped to 2.7 percent from 2.4 percent in February, slightly
more than a preliminary forecast and the fourth month it has
been above the European Central Bank's target of 2 percent.
[ID:nBRLFFE7CY]
 The ECB was the first of the three major Western central
banks to raise interest rates last week and it is expected to
move again by July despite concern over the damage higher rates
will do to economies like Portugal and Ireland struggling with
high debt.
 ""The big news in these numbers is that core inflation rose
noticeably,"" said ABN Amro analyst Nick Kounis. ""Although we
expect a rate increase at the July meeting, the balance of
risks is tilted towards an earlier move.""
 In the United States, consumer prices rose by 0.5 percent
in March to record a 2.7 percent year-over-year rate. But the
core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy and is
tracked most closely by the Fed, inched up only slightly by 0.1
percent for a tame year-over-year rate of 1.2 percent.
A separate survey on U.S. consumer sentiment showed that
inflation expectations five years hence retreated to 2.9
percent from 3.2 percent, another indicator that is tracked by
Fed officials.
""The Fed is not going to see inflation as a threat, so they
can keep interest rates low longer,"" said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard and Poor's in New York.
The central bank next reviews its policy path on April
26-27. Dealers expect its bond purchases to end this summer but
in a Reuters poll they forecast no rate increase before the
first quarter of 2012.
 In contrast, the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
has increased benchmark interest rates four times since last
October and has required the country's big lenders to freeze a
record 20 percent of their deposits.
 Dong Tao, the chief China economist for Credit Suisse,
expects tightening to resume in the second half of the year and
the rate banks offer on one-year deposits to rise another 1.5
percentage points by the end of the year.
 ""In our view, China is by no means near the end of the
current tightening cycle. Food inflation is transitory, but
service inflation and wage inflation are structural,"" he said.
 That bodes ill for Western economies that are big buyers of
manufactured goods assembled in China. If imported inflation
keeps climbing, central bankers will have to press down
domestically generated prices if they want to hit their overall
inflation targets.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Takefumi Ito	
 TOKYO, April 15 (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsui Life Insurance
plans to increase its domestic bond holdings by 200 billion yen
($2.4 billion) in the financial year to March 2012 as it seeks
to reduce risk exposure and in response to the regulatory
environment, a senior executive said on Friday.	
 Japan's fifth-largest private insurer with total assets of
around 7.5 trillion yen may trim its foreign bond holdings,
primarily in the first half of the fiscal year, Akihiro Fujioka,
head of the insurer's investment planning department, told
Reuters in an interview.	
 The company has no plans to reduce its 100 percent currency
hedging on the foreign bonds, Fujioka added. 
 ""On the whole, we will continue to shift funds from stocks
to bonds and within bonds, we will continue to shift to
super-long bonds from short-term bonds,"" Fujioka said.	
 Fujioka said Mitsui expected the world economy to continue
to grow modestly with limited inflation, helping the
disaster-stricken Japanese economy to recover in the second half
of the financial year that started on April 1.	
 But that has not changed the company's cautious investment
strategy.	
 Mitsui and many other Japanese life insurers have been
stepping up yen bond investment to match their long-term yen
liabilities, thereby reducing their exposure to interest rate
fluctuations.	
 Fujioka also cited new government regulations that took
effect in April, which raise the risk weighting on stocks and
other risky assets that insurers hold, as a reason behind shift
to bonds.	
 As of last September, Mitsui Life held 2.863 billion yen of
Japanese bonds as of September, nearly 70 percent of its
securities investment. Its share holdings stood at 346 billion
yen, about 8 percent of the total.	
 
 CURRENCY HEDGING	
 Fujioka said Japanese bond yields could rise a little as the
government is expected to need to sell more bonds to finance its
quake relief efforts.	
 ""But investors like us, most of the life insurers, will
continue to buy super-long bonds. So I'm not too worried about
fiscal deterioration,"" he said.	
 Mitsui's foreign bond investments, which stood at 446
billion yen as of September, are fully currency-hedged and
Fujioka said the company had no plans to change that stance
unless there is a clear downtrend in the yen.	
 ""There could be a moment when the dollar rises as high as 95
yen some time during the year. But there's still a risk that it
could fall to around 80 yen,"" Fujioka said.	
 The dollar traded at 83.35 yen , having risen from a
record low of 76.25 yen hit last month.	
 The company slightly increased its foreign bond investments
in the year to March but it could trim its holdings in the
current year as the cost of currency hedging -- short-term
interest rates in the dollar and the euro -- has been rising on
expectations of monetary tightening overseas, Fujioka also said.	
 Mitsui's foreign bond portfolio is roughly 60 percent dollar
denominated and 40 percent euro.	
 Fujioka said he does not expect the debt crisis to hit
Spain, though he added that the company holds German, French and
Italian sovereign bonds but not Spanish bonds.	
 Fujioka also said the company held ""not a big amount"" of
bonds issued by Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) , the
operator of a crippled nuclear power plant and the country's
largest issuer of corporate bonds.	
 Mitsui will keep holding these bonds as it expects them to
be redeemed given the public nature of the power utility's
business.

 * Bond yields at new record highs

(Adds quotes, bond yields, analyst)
 LISBON, April 15 (Reuters) - Portugal repaid around 4.2
billion euros ($6 billion) in maturing bonds on Friday as
scheduled, a finance ministry spokeswoman said as the country
sought an EU/IMF bailout to cover future financing needs.
 Even so, the cost of insuring Portuguese debt against
default rose a further 13 basis points on Friday to 603 basis
points, meaning it costs 603,000 euros to insure 10 million
euros, according to financial information service Markit.
 Portugal has another 4.9 billion euros in bonds maturing on
June 15.
 The country is negotiating bailout terms with the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund after requesting
financial aid last week. Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos
Santos has said the country will need the bailout loans to cover
its financing needs from June onwards.
 ""We've always said that we have the conditions to meet our
obligations. We made the repayment today as scheduled,"" the
spokeswoman said.
 Nevertheless, the yield investors demand on Portuguese debt
hit new euro lifetime highs on Friday, with the benchmark
10-year bond yielding over 9.26 percent, up from Thursday's
settlement of 9.15 percent. Five-year bonds yielded as much as
10.7 percent.
 Recent talk of a possible Greek debt restructuring has
pushed up yields on the bonds of other weak euro zone economies.
Portugal is the third euro zone country to request aid after
Greece and Ireland.
 ""The rise in long-term yields is natural with this issue of
Greek restructuring, since nobody knows what's going to happen,""
said Filipe Silva, debt manager at Banco Carregosa, adding
though that Portugal's shorter-term debt, to be covered by
bailout loans, could be a good buying opportunity.
 Portugal hopes the bailout deal will be finalised by
mid-May.
 Next Wednesday, the country will offer up to 1 billion euros
in 3- and 6-month treasury bills.

 TOKYO, April 15 (Reuters) - Japan's exports are expected to
have fallen in March from a year earlier, marking the first
decline in 16 months, as an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear
disaster destroyed factories and crippled supply chains,
according to a Reuters poll.	
 Exports are likely to decline further in coming months,
which could push Japan's trade balance into a deficit as
companies struggle with a shortage of electricity and parts
needed to make their goods, economists say.	
 ""Many are hoping for a V-shaped recovery, but so far there
are no signs of recovery in the supply chain,"" said Seiji
Adachi, senior economist at Deutsche Securities.	
 ""Looking at the structure of the economy, the share of cars,
car parts and electronics is quite large, so these areas could
take a huge hit.""	
 Exports in March fell 1.5 percent from the same month a year
earlier, according to economists in the poll. That would be the
first annual decline since November 2009 and come after a 9.0
percent increase in the year to February.	
 Imports are forecast to have risen an annual 6.0 percent,
slower than a revised 10.0 percent annual increase in February.	
 The trade surplus will total 493.6 billion yen ($5.9
billion), according to the poll. In February the trade surplus
stood at 654.1 billion yen.	
 Exports could continue to fall in the second quarter, which
would temporarily push the export-oriented country's trade
balance into a deficit, Adachi said. Exports could then start to
recover as Japan rebuilds following last month's disaster, he
continued.	
 A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and 10-metre tsunami on March 11
flattened northeastern coastal towns, killed thousands and
triggered a nuclear crisis that has been classified as on a par
with the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.	
 Following are economists' forecasts for the trade data

 BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange
regulator cut its short-term foreign debt quotas for 2011 in a
bid to limit the scope for investors to bet on yuan
appreciation.	
 The cut was aimed at ""maintaining balance in international

153,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2011 05:16AM ET</span>",Retail buyers cautious on HK's first yuan-denominated IPO - IFR," By Jing Song	
 HONG KONG, April 15 (Reuters) - A lukewarm response from
retail buyers to Hong Kong's first yuan-denominated initial
public offering suggests there is some way to go before the city
fully embraces shares denominated in the Chinese currency,
International Financing Review (IFR) said on Friday.	
 Hui Xian REIT, the first company to sell yuan-denominated
shares in Hong Kong, has attracted strong demand from
institutional investors for its up to 11.16 billion yuan ($1.7
billion) IPO.	
 However, orders from the retail sector are falling far short
of expectations, said IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.	
 ""The market response to the Hui Xian REIT has been a bit
slow and the retail portion has not been fully subscribed yet,""
Alvin Cheung, associate director at Prudential Brokerage, was
quoted as saying on Friday.	
 The retail offering will close on Tuesday.	
 As of April 14 - four days into bookbuilding - the public
offering tranche was still not fully covered, based on margin
financing and estimated orders, IFR said.	
 Hong Kong's main brokerages reported margin financing of
about 602 million yuan, accounting for only 27 percent of the
retail tranche, IFR said. Hui Xian REIT has set aside 20 percent
of its IPO, or 2.09-2.23 billion yuan, for retail investors.	
 Prudential Brokerage has only lent out HK$30 million ($3.9
million) of margin loans for the IPO so far, well below the
HK$1.5-10 billion it typically lends on other Hong Kong
dollar-denominated IPOs.	
 Subscriptions in cash were taking time to come through,
although about 100,000 copies of the prospectus and 400,000
white forms had been handed out, IFR said.	
 ""It seems retail investors prefer to buy in cash than
through margin financing. The reason may be that they are afraid
to get more shares in hand than expected, as the chances of that
are greater than in regular IPOs,"" said a Hong Kong-based fund
manager. ""What's more, the cost in margin financing is also a
consideration.""	
 Margin financing on Hui Xian's IPO is more expensive than
usual, with brokers charging annualised interest rates of about
2 percent, compared with the usual less than 1 percent to
compensate for the additional cost of swapping Hong Kong dollars
to yuan, IFR said.	
 Some brokerages were charging as much as 2.8 percent for
margin financing against 1-2 percent for Hong Kong dollar
issues, according to Cheung at Prudential, which charges 1.8
percent, the report said.	
 
 INTERNATIONAL INTEREST	
 The institutional portion of the offering, however, was
covered by the second day, and the company would decide on
Monday morning whether to close the book ahead of time, it said.	
 There was very little price sensitivity and most orders were
at the strike price. A huge number of orders came from investors
in London, even before the roadshow reaches the city this Monday
(April 18), IFR said.	
 The yuan-denominated REIT has even drawn the attention of
hedge funds, who are normally less interested in products where
liquidity may be limited, it said. 
 As the only yuan-denominated shares to trade in Hong Kong,
analysts are concerned that secondary trading will be thin.
Local media reported that two of the world's largest hedge
funds, Och-Ziff and Fortress, had subscribed to Hui Xian shares.	
 People involved in the deal declined to confirm details, IFR
said.	
 ""There is indeed a lot of demand from hedge funds,"" a banker
close to the deal told IFR. ""They joined the party not only
because there is a possibility to make money in the aftermarket,
but also because Hui Xian is the only big renminbi (yuan)
instrument in the market and it guarantees stable profits. If
you are bullish on the renminbi, why not buy it?""	
 Hui Xian, brought to market by Hong Kong billionaire Li
Ka-Shing's Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd , is selling 2
billion units at a guidance range of 5.24-5.58 yuan,
representing yields of 4.07?4.33 percent for 2011 and 4.44?4.73
percent for 2012, based on joint bookrunners' consensus
estimates, or a yield of 4.00?4.26 percent for 2011, based on
the company's own profit forecast.	
 That is low for a REIT, but Hui Xian was betting that the
expected renminbi appreciation of more than 3 percent this year
would help lure investors, IFR said.	
 Hui Xian controls the Oriental Plaza complex in central
Beijing, which includes a shopping centre, serviced apartments,
a luxury hotel and eight office buildings.	
 The shares will be priced on April 19 and are set to start
trading on April 29. BOC International, Citic Securities
and HSBC Holdings Plc are leading
the transaction.

(Adds details, background)
 MOSCOW, April 15 (Reuters) - Russia's Renaissance Securities
is set to place a five-year Eurobond worth $325 million with a
yield of 11 percent, IFR Markets, a Thomson Reuters news and
market analysis service, said on Friday.
 The yield is unchanged from Thursday's guidance, with Royal
Bank of Scotland, UBS and Renaissance Capital itself acting as
organisers.
 Renaissance's issue comes along with Promsvyazbank's
three-year Eurobond placement, worth $500 million with a yield
of 6.20 percent, at the lower end of initial guidance, IFR said.

 Russian corporate borrowers, who have already raised more
than $6 billion on the Eurobond market since the start of the
year on the back of high oil prices, were actively tapping debt
market this week.
 On Thursday, mid-sized Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank (TCS)
placed a $175 million Eurobond issue, jumping into the borrowing
window amid worries that Japan's nuclear crisis may worsen
global markets and lead to a rise in premiums.
 More Russian borrowers are expected to test the debt market
in upcoming weeks, with steelmaker Evraz and Alfa Bank leading
the list, sources told Reuters earlier.

 * Yields on euro zone peripheral government bonds rise
 * World stocks, Brent crude ease; gold hit record
 * China inflation confirms surge higher in March
 
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell along with bond
prices in its most-indebted member states on Friday after
Moody's cut Ireland's rating to just above ""junk"" and as
concerns weighed over Greek debt restructuring.
 Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou on Friday gave
little detail on how the country would achieve fresh austerity
and privatisation plans to bolster its finances and avoid
restructuring its debt.
 Equities in Greece and other debt-troubled euro zone
economies fell, though Ireland's share benchmark advanced. U.S.
stocks index futures were down 0.1 to 0.2 percent, indicating a
weak Wall Street open.
 Brent crude also slipped on concerns over further monetary
tightening in China after inflation there surged to a 32-month
high, though the news lifted gold to another record high.
 ""The fact that Moody's downgraded Ireland is certainly not
helpful for sentiment,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research
at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets. 
 ""It once again shows that the troubles facing the euro zone
are not completely behind us and may resurface at any given
point. Over the next couple of months we will probably be
looking at a weaker and more nervous market.""
 Moody's cut Ireland to two notches below the ratings of both
Fitch and Standard & Poor's and left its outlook on negative,
among other things pointing to the damage further rises in euro
zone interest rates would do to its economy.
 Greece will spell out fresh fiscal and privatisation plans
in a few weeks, said its prime minister, who had been expected
to present the broad outline of measures to save about 23
billion euros ($33 billion) to bring its budget deficit to
around 1 percent in 2015 from around 10 percent in 2010.
 Yields on 10-year Irish government bonds rose 10 basis
points to 9.607 percent, while those on 10-year Greek bonds
were up 6 bps to 13.492 percent.
 The cost of insuring against a default by Greece and Ireland
rose, with five-year Greek credit default swaps up 15 bps to
1,105 bps and the five-year Irish CDS up 10 bps to 555 bps.
 
 EURO SLIPS
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.4451, though it was
still up more than 8 percent against the greenback this year on
expectations of further interest rate rises by the European
Central Bank. The dollar was up 0.2 percent against a basket of
major currencies.
 The latest euro zone data showed inflation climbed higher
than expected in March to 2.7 percent year-on-year.
 ""In the short term, interest rate differentials will still
be the key driver for the euro/dollar despite these downgrades
which have been priced in by the market,"" said Paul Robson,
currency strategist, at RBS Global Banking.
 ""Euro zone periphery is a key risk but unless ongoing talk
of recapitalisation of Spanish banks and Greek debt
restructuring come to a head, we will see rate differentials
support the euro.""
 Equities in euro zone peripheral countries were also weaker,
with the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Index down 0.6
percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 and Ireland's share
benchmark rose 0.1 and 0.7 percent respectively, while world
stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index slipped 0.1
percent.
 Brent crude dipped 0.3 percent to below $122 a barrel and
copper prices firmed but still looked set to end the week
significantly lower, while gold hit a record high of $1,479.01
an ounce.

(Adds details, more comments)	
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Michiko Iwasaki	
 TOKYO, April 15 (Reuters) - Japan's Kokusai Asset Management
said it plans to increase the weighting of euro-denominated
bonds in its $33 billion bond fund, the world's second largest,
due to a solid outlook for euro-zone economies.	
 Masataka Horii, who oversees Kokusai Asset's Global
Sovereign Open fund, also told Reuters he was looking for
opportunities to buy U.S. dollar bonds, but was so far holding
back due to uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's monetary
policy.	
 Global Sovereign invests in government bonds globally with
high credit ratings. It is popular with Japanese retail
investors and has 2.75 trillion yen ($33 billion) in assets
under management, making it the world's second-largest bond fund
after PIMCO's Total Return Fund, according to data from Thomson
Reuters Lipper.	
 The fund's euro weighting rose to 31.8 percent as of April
7, up from about 24 percent in June.	
 While the weighting is above the benchmark of 30.7 in
Citigroup's World Government Bond Index (WGBI), Horii said there
was room to add to its euro holdings, citing expectations the
European Central Bank would tighten credit further this year. 
 At a peak in late 2009, Kokusai had 43 percent of the fund
in euro assets.	
 ""The euro-zone economy is improving, led by growth in
Germany. We expect this to continue to make the euro the most
attractive currency relative to others,"" Horii said in an
interview. 
 Global Sovereign's weighting in U.S. Treasuries and U.S.
agency bonds stands at 22.9 percent, below the benchmark of 26.5
percent.	
 ""We want to see how the Fed will end QE2. At this point,
it's not clear, there are still much speculation over this,""
Horii said, referring to the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying
program, known as QE2. 
 
 
 EAST EUROPE INVESTMENTS TO SLOW	
 The fund raised its yen cash positions to prepare for major
selling by investors following Japan's devastating earthquake
and tsunami on March 11, but so far has not suffered heavy
outflows, Horii said.	
 The weighting for yen-denominated bonds, including cash,
has risen to 9.1 percent after the quake from about 7 percent in
February. Horii said the fund planned to cut the weighting back
down to around 7 percent in the near term.	
 Kokusai Asset will keep its exposure to yen bonds sharply
below the benchmark of 30.9 percent with interest rates expected
to remain at unattractive levels, said Executive Officer Satoru
Yamanouchi, who was also present at the interview.	
 Yamanouchi said a series of downgrades to Japan's sovereign
ratings did not influence the fund's stance on yen bonds.	
 Moody's Investors Service warned last month after the
earthquake that the huge financial needs Japan faces may erode
investor confidence in the country's ability to repay its debts,
but said that a fiscal crisis was not imminent.	
 Standard & Poor's cut Japan's rating by a notch to AA minus
(AA-), three levels below the top grade at AAA, in late January
for the first time since 2002.	
 Global Sovereign may slow its investments in East European
bonds after a sharp rise in those weightings from the second
half of last year, Horii said. For example, the weighting for
Sweden nearly doubled to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent in July.	
 The fund has reduced holdings in Australian dollar assets to
around 6.1 percent as of April 7 from a recent high of 15.5
percent in December because the currency became less attractive
relative to the euro, Horii said.	
 Still, the fund's exposure to the Aussie remains sharply
above benchmark of 0.9 percent.	
 Global Sovereign generated a postive return of 1.1 percent
over the past 6 months to April, outperforming the benchmark
WGBI, which was flat. But over the past one year it has
underperformed slightly, registering a loss of 2.9 percent.	
 The fund has also lagged the benchmark since its inception
in December 1997 with a return of 34.8 percent, against WGBI's
gain of 47.3 percent.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, April 15 (Reuters) - Asian shares were poised for
their first weekly loss in a month on Friday as investors took
profits after a recent rally, while a pick-up in inflationary
pressures in China and elsewhere sent gold racing to yet another
record high on Friday.	
 The euro extended modest early losses after Moody's
downgraded Ireland's credit rating by two notches to Baa3, just
above ""junk"" status, citing deteriorating government finances
and weaker economic growht prospects. [ID:nWLA8186]

 Asian central banks have resorted to various measures to
tighten policy with some like Singapore sanctioning gains in the
value of their currency to keep imported inflation.	
 ""The weakness in markets this week is expected after the
smart comeback we have seen recently, with inflationary concerns
again coming to the forefront,"" said Jan Lambregts, global head
of financial markets research at Rabobank.	
 


 INFLATIONARY SCARE	
 An inflationary scare in the opening weeks of 2011 saw a
widespread selloff across emerging markets but markets have
staged a solid comeback since then as policymakers have taken
various steps to rein in price pressures.	
 Even Japan's massive earthquake and tsunmai last month has
proved to be a speed bump for investors.	
 While the Nikkei remains more than 7 percent below its
pre-quake levels, the MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
has gained around 8 percent since the March 11
disaster.	
 On Friday, stock markets in Australia , Japan
and South Korea slipped, with shares in Seoul weakening
after hitting a fresh closing high the previous session. 
 Indian stocks declined 0.9 percent as software
heavyweight Infosys Technologies slumped nearly eight percent

 The Nikkei ended down 0.5 percent. Japanese equity funds had

nine straight weeks, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.	
 Outside Japan, Asian stocks were down more
than half a percent and were set to fall about 1 percent on the
week after hitting a three-year high on Monday as fund inflows
slowed.	
 Emerging markets pulled in a net $1.2 billion in the week
ending April 13 with the iShares MSCI Emerging Market equity
fund pulling in a net $595 million, down from the prior
week's inflow of $1.6 billion. [ID:nN1483096]	
 
 GOLD SHINES	
As price pressures showed signs of accelerating, gold
considered as an inflation hedge, jumped to yet another record
high, nearing the $1,480 per ounce mark, dragging silver
along with it to 31-year highs.	
 ""We see gold peaking at $1,500 an ounce. We think there
could be some more upside in gold in the short term, especially
in this environment of high inflation and rising oil prices,""
said Natalie Robertson, commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 Gold's rally of nearly 13 percent from the January lows has
also been fuelled by the weakening dollar.	
 The dollar wallowed at a 16-month trough against a basket of
currencies as the market realised that there is scant
chance of the Fed tightening for some time to come given the
focus on unemployment rather than on inflation [ID:nFEDAHEAD]	
 Preying on the dollar's outlook has also been a rash of
growth downgrades which has also prompted investors to take
profits in U.S. stocks after recent gains.	
 A Reuters poll of economists showed 2011 gross domestic
product forecasts fell to 2.9 percent from 3.1 percent. For

 Other commodities shone, too.	
 Oil advanced slightly with Brent crude  holding above
the $122 a barrel line after suffering recent losses.	
 Grains and copper prices firmed too, with the broader

highs hit on Monday.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, April 15 (Reuters) - The euro dipped but stayed
within sight of a 15-month peak against the dollar on Friday,
with further losses expected to be limited given the diverging
outlook for monetary policy in the euro zone and the United
States. 
 Not helping the dollar, several top Federal Reserve
officials have sounded relaxed about inflation despite the
recent surge in oil prices, adding to expectations the Fed will
not cut short its $600 billion debt-buying programme.
[ID:nN14167673]	
 The euro, in contrast, remains supported by the prospect of
higher interest rates in the euro zone despite comments by
Germany that Greece may need to restructure its debt
[ID:nLDE73C28V].	
 ""When you are talking about the relative yield play, it
probably does favour the euro,"" said Andrew Robinson, FX analyst
for Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.	
 ""I don't think there is much in the way to prevent further
dollar slippage,"" Robinson said, adding that a meeting of Group
of 20 finance officials on Friday seemed unlikely to cause a
shift in that trend.	
 The euro eased 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Thursday
to $1.4472 , still not very far from a 15-month high of
$1.4521 hit earlier this week. 
 An option barrier in the euro lies at $1.4525 and there are
stops above that level, going up to $1.4550, said a trader for a
European bank in Singapore.	
 The existence of such an option barrier suggests the euro
could face selling from options players if it rises close to the
barrier level, but also means the euro could find it easier to
rise if the barrier is taken out or it expires. 
 Market players said the euro could find the going tough
above $1.45 given the sovereign debt problems, which took
a turn for the worse after Germany suggested for the first time
that Athens may have to restructure its large debt load.	
 Greek borrowing costs soared to new highs on Thursday and
added pressure on other financially weak euro zone
members.[ID:nLDE73D0XQ] 
 The euro fell 0.2 percent against the yen to 120.76 yen
, but remained well above a low of 119.26 yen hit the
previous day. The trader for a European bank in Singapore cited
selling of the euro against the yen by model funds.	
 The single currency has given up some ground against the yen
since hitting an 11-month peak of 123.33 yen on trading platform
EBS earlier this week.	
 There was little impact on currencies from a batch of
Chinese data released on Friday, with most of the numbers
already having been reported by Hong Kong media the day before.	
 Friday's data also showed China's economic growth eased just
a touch to 9.7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,
down from 9.8 percent in the last quarter of 2010 but ahead of
an expected 9.5 percent increase. [ID:nL3E7FF0AC]	


 
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 74.770 , near a 16-month trough of 74.617
struck on Thursday.	
 ""The long-term story of recycling reserves out of dollars
remains ever more pronounced following China's record reserve
accumulation in Q1 of over $3 trillion,"" analysts at BNP Paribas
wrote in a client note.	
 Indeed, following Singapore central bank's decision on
Thursday to allow its currency to strengthen to tackle
inflation, the long-Asian-currencies story remains intact, they
said.	
 ""The flows into Asia will therefore continue - and the
recycling of intervention USD will too, especially since we do
not expect much FX appreciation pressure on Asian monetary
authorities at the G20/IMF meetings this weekend,"" said BNP.	
 U.S. economic data on Thursday also failed to excite dollar
bulls and a surprise jump in U.S. jobless claims raised
questions about the health of the labour market recovery.
[ID:nN14146589]	
 The dollar held steady at 83.46 yen .	
 Like the dollar, the Japanese currency has been used as a
funding currency because of the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose
monetary policy. The BOJ may ease further to support a recovery
after last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami.	
 Another focal point for the yen is whether Japanese
institutional investors will step up investment in overseas
assets in Japan's new fiscal year that started this month.	
 Japan's Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance said earlier this week
it plans to increase its foreign bond holdings by about $826
million while reducing its currency hedging for overseas debt on
a bet the yen will weaken during the financial year to March
2012. [ID:nL3E7FB1US]

 By Ben Blanchard	
 BOAO, China, April 15 (Reuters) - South African President
Jacob Zuma on Friday added his voice to criticism of the United
States for pursuing loose policies that he said are putting the
world economy at risk.	
 Speaking at the Boao business forum on the southern Chinese
island of Hainan, Zuma said the global financial crisis had
exposed the inadequacies and shortcomings of the international
monetary system, which has the dollar at its core.	
 ""In this regard, South Africa joins the call on major
reserve currency-issuing economies to adopt responsible
macroeconomic policies. They must take into account the
ramifications of their monetary policies for both the domestic
economy and the world economy,"" he said.	
 Zuma did not refer specifically to the dollar. The euro
zone, Britain and Japan, the guardians of the other main reserve
currencies, have also adopted ultra-stimulative monetary stances
to help their economies recover from the global financial
meltdown.	
 But emerging markets have reserved particular ire for the
United States and its central bank.	
 They have repeatedly criticised the Federal Reserve's
current $600 billion bond-buying programme for depressing the
dollar and sending unwanted waves of footloose capital into
their economies in search of higher returns, pushing up exchange
rates and asset prices.	
 The dollar by some measures is trading at a record low
against the currencies of America's trading partners.	
 ""We would like to caution ... that we need to remain
vigilant to any significant moves towards trade protectionism
and competitive devaluations of individual currencies,"" Zuma
said.	
 ""If these occur, it will merely result in a race to the
bottom and undermine all G20 efforts to achieve strong,
sustainable and balanced growth,"" he added.	
 
 WAR OF WORDS	
 Zuma was speaking hours after Brazilian Finance Minister
Guido Mantega said rich countries were more to blame than China
for imbalances in the world economy. [ID:nN14211924]	
 ""The primary responsibility for the excess liquidity lies
with the advanced nations, not emerging ones,"" Mantega told
Reuters in response to questions about China's exchange rate,
which many economists say is kept artificially weak by Beijing.	
 Mantega made his comments in Washington on the eve of a
meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 rich and
developing nations. Brazil and South Africa are both G20
members, as is China.	
 G20 ministers will try yet again, after several fruitless
attempts, to agree on a formula for identifying which countries
have large external payments imbalances that are a risk to
international financial stability.	
 Zuma's stance will please his hosts. China says its current
account surplus is due not to an undervalued exchange rate but
to deep-seated factors that generate a hefty domestic savings
surplus.	
 Beijing rejected a proposal at a G20 meeting in February to
include a country's current account position and foreign
exchange reserves total as indicators of an economy out of
kilter.	
 China's current account surplus, though large, is declining
as a proportion of gross domestic product and the country ran
its first quarterly trade deficit since 2004 in the first
quarter.	
 But Beijing said on Thursday that its foreign exchange
reserves, accumulated by the central bank through purchases to
hold down the yuan's exchange rate, now exceeded $3 trillion, by
far the largest stockpile in the world. [ID:nL3E7FE11X]

(Adds details)	
 By Koh Gui Qing and Langi Chiang	
 BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - China's turbo-charged growth
eased just a touch in the first quarter, while its inflation
jumped to a 32-month high, putting pressure on the government to
do more to rein in prices and keep the economy on an even keel.	
 China's gross domestic product increased by 9.7 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, down from 9.8 percent in
the final three months of 2010 but ahead of an expected 9.5
percent pace.	
 Consumer price inflation sped to 5.4 percent in the year to
March, the fastest since July 2008 and topping market forecasts
for a 5.2 percent increase.	
 Taken together, the data published by the National Bureau of
Statistics on Friday showed that the world's second-largest
economy was still sizzling, little hindered by the central
bank's half-year tightening campaign that many investors had
feared would undermine growth.	
 They were also another reminder of the yawning gap that has
opened up between China, the world's fastest-growing major
economy, and developed nations from United States to Europe that
are still struggling to kick-start their economies after the
global financial crisis.	
 ""The figures show that (China's) inflation pressure will not
taper off in the short term and we expect the consumer inflation
to remain high in the second quarter,"" said Sun Miaoling, an
economist with CICC, the largest Chinese investment bank.	
 ""The government will keep battling inflation as its priority
in coming months, which could prompt the central bank to further
tighten its monetary policies,"" she added.	
 The People's Bank of China has increased benchmark interest
rates four times since last October and has required the
country's big banks to lock up a record high of 20.0 percent of
their deposits as reserves.	
 Global markets registered little impact from the Chinese
data, in large part because the numbers had been comprehensively
leaked in the days prior to the official release.	
 The main Chinese stock index in Shanghai was down 0.5
percent after morning trading and share prices throughout Asia
were also slightly softer, with investors braced for Beijing's
next round of tightening. Many analysts believe the central bank
could increase required reserves again as soon as this weekend.	
 
 
 TIGHTENING NOT DONE	
 Inflation had long been expected to run higher in March
because of a lower base of comparison. The base effect also
suggests that inflation is likely to level off in the coming
months before jumping again in June and July, though officials
are confident that it will wane in the second half of the year.	
 Accepting this relatively sanguine view, many economists had
thought that the central bank was near the end of its tightening
cycle. The median forecast of Reuters poll last week was for
just one more interest rate increase over the rest of this year.	
 But with growth still cruising near double digits, the scope
for the government to continue tightening may be bigger than
previously anticipated.	
 Signalling a potentially hawkish stance in the coming
months, Premier Wen Jiabao said this week that the government
would use all tools at its disposal to wrestle inflation under
control.	
 ""We will try every means to stabilise prices, the top
priority of our economic controls this year and also our most
pressing task,"" Wen said at a cabinet meeting.	
 Agricultural prices have been the main driver of Chinese
inflation and that remained the case, with food costs up 11.7
percent in the year to March. But there were also signs of a
broadening of pressures, with non-food inflation up 2.7 percent
year on year, the fastest in more than a decade.	
 ""The risk is that high oil prices will keep headline
inflation stronger for longer,"" said Brian Jackson, economist
with Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.	
 ""This also suggests that policy rates still need to move
higher in the months ahead, with Beijing also likely to favour
further currency appreciation to help get inflation lower,"" he
said.	
 While keeping a tight grip on the yuan, China has steered
its exchange rate to a succession of record highs against the
dollar in recent days, using a stronger currency to blunt the
impact of high import costs.	
 
 REBALANCING?	
 The first-quarter data also offered a glimpse of the Chinese
rebalancing that is needed to put the global economy on more
stable footing.	
 From the World Bank to Chinese leaders, the consensus has
long been that China needs to promote more domestic consumption
and cut its reliance on both exports and energy-intensive
investment.	
 That finally appears to be happening. Consumption
contributed 5.9 percentage points to China's first-quarter
growth rate, while investment added 4.3 percentage points, the
statistics agency said. Net exports actually subtracted 0.5
percentage points, weighed down by a $1 billion trade deficit,
China's first quarterly deficit in seven years.	
 It remains to be seen how much of the apparent rebalancing
was a product of soaring global oil costs, which both boosted
China's import bill and inflated consumption in price terms.	
 Speaking at a business forum in southern China on Friday,
President Hu Jintao said that the country's economic model was
still out of kilter.	
 ""Over the next five years China will make a great effort to
boost domestic demand, especially consumer demand,"" he said.

 * G20 looks for path to sustainable growth, prosperity
 * Guidelines for global imbalances to top agenda
 By Jan Strupczewski and Daniel Flynn
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Faced with an uneven world
recovery and uncertain outlook, finance leaders were hoping on
Friday to flesh out a plan to build a global economy less prone
to the booms and busts of recent decades.
 Forging consensus among central bankers and ministers from
the Group of 20 advanced and developing economies won't be easy
amid the current array of threats to stability, including high
oil prices and debt levels, and unrest across the Middle East.
 But with officials eager to avoid a recurrence of the
2007-2009 crisis and the worst global recession since World War
Two, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said addressing
imbalances between export-rich and debt-burdened countries that
have long plagued the global economy was a top G20 priority.
 Many economists say these imbalances contributed to the
crisis, as emerging market countries reinvested their surpluses
in Western markets and caused excessive risk-taking by banks.
 The G20 accounts for 85 percent of world output and is now
the main forum for trying to reform the world's financial
system. But it has become hard to agree on just how to do that
now that the darkest days of the financial crisis have passed.
 An uncertain outlook complicates things further. Signs of
recovery in some rich countries have led their central banks to
raise interest rates. But high oil and food prices threaten to
slow growth and worsen unrest in some developing countries.
 Then, there's the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis,
political infighting over the massive U.S. deficit and the
damage from last month's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis
in Japan, the world's third-largest economy.
 Officials on Friday were likely to push for a deal on how
to apply guidelines to identify countries with excess trade
deficits or surpluses.
 ""It is a matter of credibility for the G20 that we agree on
the indicative guidelines this weekend,"" said Olli Rehn, the
European Union's economic and monetary affairs commissioner.
 The International Monetary Fund, which holds its
twice-yearly meetings this weekend, warned officials not to
grow complacent about the recovery's prospects.
 ""The apex of the crisis is behind us, but it would be part
of the complacency I am trying to avoid to believe we are in a
post-crisis era,"" IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said.
 The G20 wasn't expected on Friday to name specific
countries that spend or save too much, but if it did, the
United States and China would almost certainly top the list.
 It would probably include others. French Finance Minister
Christine Lagarde said Thursday the biggest economies -- those
representing 5 percent of total G20 output -- might get special
scrutiny. That would also include France, Germany and Japan.
 Beyond that the G20 hopes to discuss how to apply
guidelines. That might be done through computer modeling, with
sources telling Reuters four different models for identifying
imbalances were being discussed.
 Canada's Flaherty expected ministers to reach agreement,
but added: ""there are still some bumps along the road.""
 China has expressed suspicion that the effort may be aimed
at pressuring it to reduce its hefty trade surpluses.
 At a February meeting in Paris, G20 ministers agreed on a
list of indicators for monitoring imbalances, including public
debt, private savings and borrowing. But China balked at any
mention of the real effective exchange rate or foreign currency
reserves.
 China's foreign exchange reserves -- a stockpile that
reflects Beijing's exporting prowess -- soared to a record of
more than $3 trillion by the end of March, a sum certain to
raise eyebrows in Washington. [ID:nL3E7FE19O]
 Reducing deficits is also crucial, and the IMF this week
said the United States may have a hard time of meeting a G20
goal of halving its deficit by 2013.
 President Barack Obama presented a plan this week to cut
the deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years, but his former
economic adviser said the country should wait until after
growth is strong enough to warrant higher interest rates.
 If the United States were to slash its deficit next year,
""the consequences for real economic activity would be most
unfortunate,"" said ex-White House economic adviser Lawrence
Summers said Thursday.

 WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda on Thursday urged G7 countries to take
appropriate action on currencies when needed, as the country
struggles with the damage from last month's devastating
earthquake and tsunami.	
 The G7 finance leaders discussed Japan's earthquake,
Europe's debt woes and the political situation in the Middle
East and North Africa as risks to the global economy, Noda told
reporters.	
 ""I expressed gratitude to the G7 countries for cooperating
in the joint currency intervention on March 18. I also asked the
G7 countries to continue to take appropriate action together
while closely watching markets,"" he told reporters after a
meeting with his G7 counterparts.	
 The Group of Seven developed nations met behind closed doors
on Thursday evening, followed by talks by the larger Group of 20
rich and emerging countries. The G20 is expected to issue a
communique after its second day of talks on Friday.	
 Noda said G7 nations agreed that the March intervention was
effective in curbing excessive and disorderly exchange-rate
moves. But he said there were no specific discussions within the
group on future possible action in the foreign exchange market.	
 The G7 -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy and Japan -- conducted a rare coordinated
intervention in currency markets last month after the yen
strengthened sharply following the earthquake.	
 Noda also spent most of his time discussing the March
currency intervention when he met European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet on Thursday, a senior Japanese
finance ministry official said. The two did not discuss Japan's
monetary policy, the official said.	
 The Japanese finance minister expects to meet U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner for bilateral talks on Friday.	
 
 GLOBAL RECOVERY INTACT	
 Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War Two after
the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami battered its
northeast coast last month, crippling a nuclear power plant and
disrupting factory output with power and parts
shortages.	
 At the G20 working dinner, Noda said he explained that there
were various uncertainties over the impact of the quake and the
nuclear power crisis on the economy, such as the damage to
business and household sentiment as well as the effect of power
supply shortages on corporate activity.	
 He then pledged to provide sufficient information to the
global community on the nuclear crisis, and that Japan will
continue on its path toward restoring medium- to long-term
fiscal health.	
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, who was also
present at the G7 and G20 gatherings, said Japan's earthquake
was cited by a G7 member country as among the risks to the
global economy.	
 ""Japan was hit by such a big earthquake so it would be among
the risks. But I didn't get the sense that the earthquake was
singled out as a major risk,"" Shirakawa told reporters.	
 The G20 finance leaders, in a full day of talks on Friday,
will discuss the risks to the global economy and aim to seek
common ground on how to shrink global imbalances for fostering
sustainable growth.	
 Geithner told a conference on Thursday that despite the
risks in oil, the financial challenges in parts of Europe and
Japan's quake, there was a ""gradual strengthening in confidence""
that the world economy will grow at a reasonable rate.	
 That feeling seems to be shared by G20 members, according to
the Japanese finance ministry official, who said the outlook for
global growth was generally upbeat despite Japan's quake,
Europe's debt woes and political instability in North Africa.	
 ""The tone (within the G20) is that the global economic
recovery is actually stronger than expected, but that the three
risks are emerging,"" he said.

 * Another round of tightening from China likely
 * Gold at a record high, silver at 31-year peaks
 * Inflows into emerging market funds slows - Lipper

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, April 15 (Reuters) - Asian shares were poised for
their first weekly losses in a month, as investors took profits
after a recent rally while a pick-up in inflationary pressures
sent gold racing to yet another record high on Friday.	
 Financial markets braced for another round of policy
tightening from Beijing, possibly as early as this weekend,
after fresh data showed consumer price inflation accelerating to
5.4 percent in the year to March, the fastest since July 2008
and topping market forecasts. [ID:nL3E7FF06Z]	
 Asian central banks have resorted to various measures to
tighten policy with some like Singapore sanctioning an increase
in the value of their currency to keep prices in check.	
 ""The weakness in markets this week is expected after the
smart comeback we have seen recently with inflationary concerns
again coming to the forefront,"" said Jan Lambregts, global head
of financial markets research at Rabobank.

 
 INFLATIONARY SCARE	
 An inflationary scare in the opening weeks of 2011 saw a
widespread selloff across emerging markets but markets have
staged a smart comeback since then as policymakers have taken
various steps to rein in price pressures.	
 Even the triple natural disaster in Japan has proved to be a
speed bump for investors.	
 While the Nikkei remains more than 7 percent below its
pre-quake levels, the MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
has gained around 8 percent since the disaster.	
 On Friday, stock markets in Australia , Japan
and South Korea slipped, with shares in Seoul weakening
after hitting a fresh closing high the previous session. 
 The Nikkei was down 0.4 percent. Japanese equity funds had
minor outflows of $8.7 million, breaking their inflow streak of
nine straight weeks, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.	
 Outside Japan, stocks were down 0.2 percent
Friday and were set to weaken for the week after hitting a
three-year high on Monday as fund inflows slowed.	
 Emerging markets pulled in a net $1.2 billion in the week
ending April 13 with the iShares MSCI Emerging Market equity
fund pulling in a net $595 million, down from the prior
week's inflow of $1.6 billion. [ID:nN1483096]	
 
 GOLD SHINES	
As price pressures showed signs of picking up, gold
considered as an inflation hedge, jumped to yet another record
high, nearing the $1,480 per ounce mark, dragging silver
along with it to 31-year highs.	
 ""We see gold peaking at $1,500 an ounce. We think there
could be some more upside in gold in the short term, especially
in this environment of high inflation and rising oil prices,""
said Natalie Robertson, commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 Gold's rally of nearly 13 percent from the January lows has
also been fuelled by the weakening dollar.	
 The dollar wallowed at a 16-month trough against a basket of
currencies as the market realised that there is scant
chance of the Fed tightening for some time to come given the
focus on unemployment rather than on inflation [ID:nFEDAHEAD]	
 Preying on the dollar's outlook has also been a rash of
growth downgrades which has also prompted investors to take
profits in U.S. stocks after recent gains.	
 A Reuters poll of economists showed 2011 gross domestic
product forecasts fell to 2.9 percent from 3.1 percent. For
details, see [ID:nSLAEFE7SW]	
 Other commodities shone too.	
 Oil saw a solid start with Brent crude  up nearly
half a percent to $122.45. Grains and copper prices firmed too,
with the broader Reuters-Jefferies commodities index
flirting near record highs hit on Monday.	
 In the bond markets, ten-year U.S. notes crawled
in a tight band before inflation data due later in the day.

 By Isabel Versiani and Pedro da Costa
 WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - Brazil's finance minister
on Thursday renewed his vocal support for China in the global
war of words over who is to blame for imbalances in the world
economy.
 In an interview, Finance Minister Guido Mantega struck a
friendlier tone toward China than some comments from the
government of newly elected Brazilian President Dilma
Rousseff.
 ""The primary responsibility for the excess liquidity lies
with the advanced nations, not emerging ones,"" he said in
response to questions about China's exchange rate, which many
economists say is artificially undervalued.
 ""Emerging countries are helping because they are pushing
the international economy. So China contributes, Brazil
contributes, Russia, India,"" Mantega told Reuters on Thursday.
 He was speaking in Washington ahead of a twice-annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund.
 Rousseff is visiting China this week for a summit of the
BRICS group of leading emerging economies. She has made no
mention of the yuan, despite sounding more critical than her
predecessor, Luiz Inacio da Silva.
 The comments from Mantega suggest the United States cannot
count on Brazil as a firm ally in its fight against what it
sees as the unfair trade advantage China gains from pegging its
exchange rate to the dollar.
 Mantega urged the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central
banks in developed countries to reverse ultra-loose monetary
policies, a change which would help push the Chinese yuan
higher as well, given its link to the dollar.
 ""These are understandable because they are experiencing
weaker growth. But they should not exaggerate on the dosage,""
said Mantega, who has made waves in international markets by
saying the developed world is engaged in a ""currency war.""
 ""The ideal for us would be for both the dollar and China's
currency to appreciate, so that we would have a new exchange
rate and commercial equilibrium in the world.""
 Mantega told Reuters he felt moves to prevent Brazil's
currency from strengthening had been a success despite a recent
rise in the real to its highest levels since August 2008.
 The real might now be as strong as $1.35-$1.40, instead of
its current level around $1.58, without the string of taxes on
foreign inflows and borrowing and other measures, he said.
 Separately, Mantega, in a prepared statement that he is due
to make to the International Monetary Fund's steering committee
on Saturday, reiterated Brazil's stiff opposition to any
restrictions on its ability to impose controls on flows of
capital.
 ""These measures of self-defense are a legitimate response
to the effects of the monetary policies adopted by reserve
currency-issuing countries,"" he said in the statement.
 Brazil was also succeeding in combating price growth even
though inflation has risen to close to the 6.5 percent ceiling
of the government's target range.
 Mantega said: ""Inflation is under control.""
 Turning to another issue under discussion this week in
Washington, where the Group of 20 leading economies are
discussing reform of the financial system, Mantega blamed
commodity price spikes in part on lax regulations of
derivatives trading in advanced economies.
 He said Brazil would push for tougher derivatives rules,
including more trading via transparent clearinghouses and
imposing leverage requirements on investors using the complex
securities for purely speculative purposes.

 * Global arms market watching Typhoon performance, costs
 
 By Mohammed Abbas
 LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - A British parliamentary
watchdog on Friday criticised delays and cost inflation in the
production of the new Typhoon fighter jet, prompting the defence
ministry to defend the project.
 The Eurofighter Typhoon is built by Britain's BAE Systems,
Italy's Finmeccanica and European aerospace group EADS, and this
week conducted its first combat operation, enforcing a United
Nations resolution in Libya.
 In a scathing report, the parliament's Committee of Public
Accounts, which scrutinises the way government departments spend
money but has no regulatory powers, said the Typhoon project was
mismanaged, pushing up costs.
 ""The history of the Typhoon fighter aircraft represents yet
another example of over-optimism, bad planning and an
unacceptably high bill for the taxpayer,"" said committee chair
Margaret Hodge in a statement.
 ""The (defence ministry) is now buying 30 percent fewer
Typhoon fighter aircraft than originally planned, the cost of
the project is now expected to be 3.5 billion pounds ($5.7
billion) more than was originally approved ... the cost of each
aircraft has increased by 75 per cent,"" she added.
 The watchdog said the overall project cost had risen to 20.2
billion pounds and that the cost of each plane had risen to 126
million pounds each. The body also said it had taken too long to
bring the jet -- conceived in the 1980s -- into service.
 Britain is buying 160 of the aircraft, and the accounts
committee suggested that support costs for the plane could be
higher than originally budgeted.
 Global demand for a new generation of fighter jets has
surged, and the arms market is likely to be watching the
Typhoon's performance in Libya closely, weighing up its
advantages against its purchase and running costs.
 The defence ministry defended the Typhoon project, and said
problems in its production were being resolved.
 ""The Typhoon is a world beating air-to-air fighter and is
fast developing a ground attack capability as is being
demonstrated in Libya,"" Defence Secretary Liam Fox said in a
statement.
 ""I am determined that in the future such projects are
properly run from the outset, and I have announced reforms to
reduce equipment delays and cost overruns,"" he added.
 British government departments have been under pressure in
recent months to slash spending to reduce a national budget
deficit, and the defence ministry in particular has been
strongly criticised for over-spending in previous years.

 LIMA, April 14 (Reuters) - Peru's currency weakened
slightly on Thursday and stocks were volatile as investors
feared left-wing presidential candidate Ollanta Humala could
win a June run-off against right-wing Keiko Fujimori.
 The local currency, the sol , closed bidding 0.07
percent weaker at 2.821 per dollar, its weakest level since
December. The central bank intervened to sell $91 million in
the local spot market to keep the sol from weakening further.
 Peru's finance minister pleaded for calm after markets
closed, saying the country's economic fundamentals have never
been stronger and calling for the candidates to detail their
proposals for investors in one of the world's fastest-growing
economies. For more, see: [ID:nN13295500]
 Analysts said to expect more volatility in coming days.
 ""Judging by the rising anxiety of investors in Peruvian
assets, more pressure is likely to come,"" said a report from
IDEAglobal. ""Underlying any such move will be the fear that Mr.
Humala could actually reach the presidency, as his run-off
rival, Keiko Fujimori, generates plenty of fear herself.""
 The benchmark stock index <.IGRA> closed up 0.63 percent
after being down nearly 6 percent early in the session. The
local bourse is down nearly 12 percent from its Friday close.
 ""The uncertainty continues, foreign and local investors are
selling part of their positions,"" said Roberto Flores, an
analyst at Inteligo SAB brokerage in Lima. ""But it seems like
some investors are starting to take advantage of the lower
prices in some stocks.""
 Peru's largest miner by share value, Buenaventura 
, closed up 0.47 percent on the Lima exchange.
 Chilean retailers with hefty investments in Peru have also
fallen since Humala won the first-round election on Sunday.
Falabella  closed down 0.97 percent on the Santiago
exchange <.IPSA>.
The cost of insuring Peru's debt rose 3 points to 152.

 WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - Brazilian Finance Minister
said on Thursday he will push for tougher oversight of
derivatives at this weekend's gathering of major world
economies, blaming speculation for a run-up in commodity
prices.
 In an interview with Reuters, Mantega took a decidedly
friendlier tone toward China despite what is widely seen as
Brazil's disadvantage in exports market due to a lack of
flexibility in the Chinese yuan.
 ""The primary responsibility for the excess liquidity lies
with the advanced nations, not emerging ones,"" he said in
response to questions about China's exchange rate, which many
economists say is artificially undervalued. ""Emerging countries

So China contributes, Brazil contributes, Russia, India.""
 That was a shift from the minister, who is now working
under a new president, Dilma Rousseff. She took over from the
popular Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the start of this year.

 * Peru sol at four-month low on election jitters
 * Colombia peso jumps, helped by ratings upgrade bets
 * Brazil real firms 0.7 pct, Mexico peso 0.52 pct
 * U.S. jobless claims back bets for low rates
 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, April 14 (Reuters) - Brazil's real and
Mexico's peso jumped on Thursday, backed by bets that weaker
U.S. growth will keep ultra-easy monetary policy in place, but
a possible retreat in the euro could reverse gains.
 After rallying since mid-March, the two Latin American
currencies have settled into tighter ranges, and further strong
gains could be limited as investors gauge whether risks to
global growth from high oil prices and inflation are
increasing.
 As long as fears about global growth do not rise markedly,
slower expansion in the United States would cause the Federal
Reserve to stick with its $600 billion asset-buying program
until June and keep U.S. rates near zero through 2011.
 ""That is good for emerging markets. People still want
higher-yielding, risky assets,"" said Doug Smith, head of Latin
America research at Standard Chartered in New York.
 Data showed U.S. initial claims for unemployment benefits
rose unexpectedly last week, adding to a string of weaker data.
For details, see [ID:nN14146589].
 ""If things turn out even worse, it could have a negative
effect on Mexico, but we are not at that point yet,"" Smith
added. The United States is Mexico's top trading partner.
 Mexico's peso   strengthened 0.5 percent to
11.7190 per U.S. dollar, pulling back from an intraday high
that marked its strongest since October 2008.
 Brazil's real  bid 0.7 percent firmer to 1.5780 per
dollar. Brazilian authorities are trying to contain the real's
advance, which is hurting local manufacturers.
 But investors continue to find ways around authorities'
efforts and recently pushed the real to its strongest since
August 2008.
 Brazil has seen a tide of speculative flows from investors
seeking to game low interest rates in developed economies
against the pay-off of Brazil's double-digit interest rates.
 Strategists at Citigroup noted that Latin American
currencies have recently increased their correlation with the
euro while the tendency of the region's currencies to track
U.S. stocks has faded.
 The dollar has weakened against the euro and emerging
market currencies as the U.S. central bank is seen lagging
Europe in raising interest rates.
 ""At this point we continue to expect euro to move higher
and hence think Latam FX may not sell off too much should (the
S&P 500) drift lower near term,"" Citigroup strategists wrote in
a note to clients. However, with a lot of hikes already priced
into the euro, the ""risk of Latam FX selling off due to a
weaker euro has admittedly increased,"" they added.
 Both Mexico's peso and Brazil's real have so many investors
betting on further gains that any sharp reversal can spur
cascading losses as the hoard of investors rush to get out of
positions, as was seen earlier this week. [nN12198414]
 Colombia's peso  rose 0.72 percent to 1,806 per
dollar, pushed up by dollar inflows for tax payments and
expectations of another credit rating upgrade.
 Traders said rumors Colombia -- which regained its
investment grade credit status from Standard and Poor's last
month -- would soon get an upgrade from another rating agency.
 A second agency upgrade is a requirement before many
institutional investors could pick up Colombian assets. 
 Chile's peso  bid 0.15 percent weaker at 472.70 per
dollar on falling prices for copper, the country's top export.
 Reports of quickening inflation in China pointed to more
monetary tightening, which investors worried would hit demand
for industrial metals.
 Peru's sol closed at its weakest since December amid
continued concerns that a left-wing candidate could win a
presidential run-off election. [ID:nVOTEPE]
 But the currency pulled back from its session low as the
countries stock market rebounded after a 12 percent slump.
 The sol  bid 0.07 percent weaker at 2.8210 per
dollar. Peru's currency has shed nearly 2 percent since
mid-March on concerns of a victory by left-wing nationalist
Ollanta Humala. He will face right-wing candidate Keiko
Fujimori in a a June 5 run-off.

* Drug industry said on board to share costs of helping poor
 
 By Stephanie Nebehay
 GENEVA, April 14 (Reuters) - A global deal is tantalisingly
close under which countries would share flu virus samples in
exchange for access to affordable vaccines derived from them,
thus saving lives in a pandemic, senior diplomats said.
 Consensus has been reached across all regions, including
Indonesia which three years ago stopped sharing influenza
samples with the World Health Organisation (WHO), but the United
States has yet to give formal approval, they said on Thursday.
 The hope was to reach agreement by Friday on a political
deal to be presented for approval by health ministers at the
annual meeting of the U.N. agency scheduled for May 16-24.
 ""There is a package. Everybody is on board, including
Indonesia. The U.S. delegation is checking with Washington
overnight but the U.S. ambassador has recommended going along,""
one ambassador told Reuters late on Thursday. An envoy from a
major country in Asia called it a ""model"" agreement.
 A U.S. spokesman in Geneva said: ""Negotiations are still
ongoing."" He had no other details on the closed-door talks.
 Negotiations began four years ago between WHO's 193 members
after the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus emerged in southeast Asia.
A year later, Indonesia stopped sharing flu virus samples with
WHO's network of laboratories, demanding its share of vaccines.
 Ambassadors Juan Jose Gomez Camacho of Mexico and Bente
Angell-Hansen of Norway, who co-chair the talks, told reporters
on Tuesday that a deal was near but challenges remained,
including how to define the drug industry's role and to overcome
intellectual property issues. 
 They met top officials from 30 drug companies last week,
including GlaxoSmithkline, Sanofi-Aventis and Novartis to win
their support for providing affordable vaccines to developing
countries lacking local vaccine makers.
 The drug industry has now agreed to provide about one-half
of an estimated $58 million needed a year to help poor countries
through donations of vaccines and anti-virals as well as
financing to improve their laboratory capacity, according to
senior diplomats on Thursday evening.
 Industry executives have reported that current annual
production capacity for pandemic flu vaccine is 1.1 billion
doses, forecast to rise to 1.8 billion in four to five years.
This was up from 500 million doses during the H1N1 swine flu
pandemic of 2009-10, the first influenza pandemic in more than
40 years.
 During the pandemic, the WHO coordinated the distribution of
78 million doses of vaccines to 77 countries from Cuba to
Zimbabwe, but distribution was slow due to regulatory and other
hurdles. The doses were donated by rich nations and drug makers.
 The working group's draft document calls for having deals in
place ahead of the next pandemic, including pre-purchase
agreements with industry and governments to reserve a certain
percentage of production capacity, for example 10 percent,
earmarked for countries without access to vaccines.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2011 05:52PM ET</span>",Developing world defends use of capital controls," * IMF has endorsed use of controversial capital controls
 * Emerging nations fear new IMF conditions
 By Missy Ryan
 WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - Developing nations warned
the IMF on Thursday against imposing new rules dictating how
they manage capital rushing into their economies, suggesting
rich nations take a hard look at their own policies instead.
 The G24 group of developing nations, in a communique issued
ahead of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's
spring meetings, said efforts by advanced nations to stem
recession with loose monetary policy had fueled commodity
speculation and capital flows into the developing world.
 The group, which includes fast-growing Brazil and India,
urged the IMF to take an ""open-minded and even-handed approach""
to managing capital flows and called on the fund to examine
policies in major financial centers that have been the source
of ""hot money"" plowed into emerging markets.
 The ministers rejected the IMF's controversial proposal for
a new framework, endorsed earlier this month, that could guide
how developing countries deal with capital surges and
potentially add a new set of conditions to IMF support.
 As the world seeks to shake off a long downturn, growth in
many developing countries has outpaced that in rich economies.
But emerging nations are grappling with an influx of capital
that has pushed their currencies higher, bruised their export
competitiveness and raised the risk of asset bubbles.
 Several, including Brazil, have taken steps to stem the
capital tide. The IMF's framework lays out a range of policy
tools, including capital controls, countries could tap to ward
off unwanted surges in investor capital.
 ""The idea of having a toolkit is a good one. The thing we
had a problem with was to say these things get integrated into
the surveillance program of the IMF,"" Lesetja Kganyago,
director-general of South Africa's National Treasury, told
reporters following a meeting of G24 officials.
 The IMF framework represents a break from a long-held IMF
taboo on capital controls.
 Allowing for currency appreciation, and purchasing foreign
exchange if reserve levels are not adequate, tops the IMF
policy list. Other options include lowering interest rates or
tightening fiscal policy when economic overheating is not a
concern.
 But G24 countries are fighting for flexibility as they
blame loose monetary policy in advanced countries, such as the
United States, for their troubles. In particular, the Federal
Reserve's $600 billion bond-buying spree has drawn complaints
from countries who say it has sent cash flooding into their
economies, complicating their monetary policy.
 ""We actually think ... the countries should have the
discretion to respond depending on where they are in their
business cycles,"" Kganyago said.
 ""Those deliberations will have to continue.""
 The G24 ministers also called for ""urgent and concerted""
measures to mitigate the effects of high food and energy
prices, suggesting IMF conditionality and interest rates could
be relaxed, and greater World Banks support for agriculture.

 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world
markets and the U.S. dollar slipped on Thursday as Greece's
debt problem, Chinese inflation and disappointing U.S. jobs
data stoked worries over a global economic slowdown.
 Bonds and gold rose as uneasy investors sought safe-haven from stocks and riskier investments.
 ""We do have to scale back growth expectations. The market
is more concerned about what growth will be like with rising
input costs,"" said Jerry Webman, senior investment officer and
chief economist at OppenheimerFunds in New York.
 U.S. oil prices climbed on the weaker dollar.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world index

 European stocks <.FTEU3> ended down 0.6 percent.
 Wall Street stocks ended little changed, erasing earlier
losses on late buying in energy and consumer staples.
 Analysts said the choppy session underscored the current
divide among investors, which could keep stock markets in tight
trading ranges in the coming weeks.
 ""The 'risk-on' and 'risk-off' trades are battling right
now,"" said Perry Piazza, director of investment strategies at
Contango Capital Advisors in San Francisco

 The S&P 500 index closed up 0.1 percent at 1,314.52, while

source, said China's annual inflation rate in March was likely
to be 5.3 percent to 5.4 percent, a 32-month high and just
above an estimate in a Reuters poll. [ID:nL3E7FE0EO]
 Investors are concerned about Chinese inflation in case the

fight off the drag from weaker ones.
 ""Europe is probably on the mend without saying the pain in
the peripherals is over,"" said Sam Wardwell, investment

 A year ago, the deterioration of Europe's sovereign debt
problem held back the global recovery and forced the European
Central Bank to leave rates steady longer than expected.

 * Lawmakers says spending cuts necessary
(Recasts with further quotes from officials)
 By Rachelle Younglai and Jeff Mason
 WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - The Obama administration
expressed confidence on Thursday that the United States would
raise its debt ceiling, saying Republican leaders understood
the urgency of doing so despite vocal opposition from some in
their party.
 Congress is under pressure to raise the $14.3 trillion
borrowing limit before it is reached as early as mid-May.
 But Republicans are unwilling to do so without spending
cuts and have threatened to take negotiations to the deadline
-- an outcome that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, is eager
to avoid.
 Top administration officials said Republican leaders who
met with Obama on Wednesday made clear they understood the
importance of the issue.
 ""The Republican leaders say in private what they say in
public, which is to say, 'of course we recognize we have to
pass the debt limit, of course we recognize that America will
meet its obligation,'"" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
said.
 ""They understand that you can't take any risk the world
starts to think the United States won't meet its obligations.
There's no conceivable way that this city, this government can
court that basic risk.""
 Democratic and Republican leaders from the Senate and the
House of Representatives discussed the issue during a meeting
with Obama on Wednesday before his speech laying out a plan to
reduce the deficit.
 ""I think that in the meeting that the president had with
the leaders yesterday, there was a pretty broad understanding
that not extending the debt limit is just not an option,"" Gene
Sperling, who heads the White House's National Economic
Council, told a Bertelsmann Foundation forum.
 The Treasury has forecast that the ceiling will be reached
by May 16. It can take emergency measures to avoid hitting the
debt ceiling, but those actions will only buy the United States
a limited amount of time, until around July 8.
 After that date Treasury will be unable to borrow money to
fund government operations such as paying interest on U.S.
debt.
 BLAME, CUTS
 If the debt ceiling were reached, prices on bonds issued by
the U.S. government might rise. In the past the government has
reduced the amount of debt it sells on a regular basis to pay
for daily government expenses, such as wages for federal
workers. It has also suspended the sale of new debt to stay
under the debt limit.
 With fewer bonds in the marketplace, prices rise on
existing debt.
 Geithner told Republican lawmakers they would shoulder the
blame if Congress failed to raise the debt limit before markets
grow uneasy.
 ""(Lawmakers) will say, 'there's leverage in it, we can
advance it.' But that would be deeply irresponsible and they
will own the risk,"" he said.
 ""It won't happen in the end, but if they take it too close
to the edge, they will own responsibility for that
miscalculation,"" he said.
 Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee agreed
that the debt ceiling had to be raised, but not without
conditions to address the massive U.S. debt.
 ""We obviously recognize that we have to address debt
reduction. That is obviously going to be central to the
discussion and the debate with respect to voting on the debt
ceiling,"" Republican Senator Olympia Snowe said.
 ""There is probably bipartisan agreement on the issue of the
necessity and the urgency of addressing the overall debt
reduction issue in some fashion,"" she said.
 Fellow Republican Senator John Thune told reporters he did
not know how the debt ceiling could be raised without doing
something to address the country's outstanding public debt,
currently at $14.26 trillion.
 According to a Reuters analysis of U.S. borrowing needs, an
increase of more than $2 trillion would last until the November
2012 presidential election.

 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened across

 ECB rate hike expectations have shifted in recent days.
 The market on Monday had been pricing in 140 basis points
of ECB interest rate hikes over the next 12 months. However
over the last three trading sessions this has been pushed out
and the market is now only pricing in four hikes over the next
year.
 The euro may face additional headwinds over the near-term
as market participants speculate the European Central Bank to
keep the benchmark interest rate at 1.25 percent in May, said
David Song, the currency analyst at DailyFX.com in New York.
 ""In turn, the EUR/USD may have reached a top in April, and
the exchange rate may ultimately breakout of the upward trend
from earlier this year as the ongoing turmoil within the
European financial system weighs on market sentiment,"" he
said.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar fell 0.5
percent against the Swiss franc  at 0.8918, according to
Reuters data. It earlier hit a record low of 0.8892.
 The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4488  in
volatile trading. It was trading lower earlier following a
resurgence of sovereign debt fears.
 The euro has gained 8.3 percent on the dollar in 2011 even
with events that would typically be negative for the currency,
such as uprisings in the Middle East and Japan's earthquake.
 ""Despite the turmoil in Egypt, Libya and all of the other
shocks, the euro still managed to move higher,"" said Rob
Bogucki, head of FX North American trading at Barclays Capital
in New York.
 The dollar traded down against the yen, falling 0.6 percent
to 83.40 yen .
 One trader cited real money offers above 83.50 yen with
further falls likely to target the 100-day moving average at
around 82.72 yen.
 The greenback's losses pushed it below its 200-day moving
average near 83.43 yen as investors cut sizable long positions
built after the U.S. currency's speedy ascent from its record
low of 76.25 in March.
 The dollar, in particular, was badly hit by U.S. initial
jobless claims, which were higher than expected in the latest
week. See [ID:nN14146589].

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world
markets and the U.S. dollar fell on Thursday as Greece's debt
problem, Chinese inflation and disappointing U.S. jobs data
stoked worries over a global economic slowdown.
 Bonds and gold rose as uneasy investors sought safehaven
from stocks and riskier investments.
 ""We do have to scale back growth expectations. The market
is more concerned about what growth will be like with rising
input costs,"" said Jerry Webman, senior investment officer and
chief economist at OppenheimerFunds in New York. ""People are
looking at 'risk-off' trades.""
 U.S. oil prices climbed on the weaker dollar.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.2 percent despite a burst of corporate
activity that would usually lift investors' spirits. On a
year-to-date basis, the index was still up 4.1 percent.
 While investors fret over a global slowdown, economists in
the latest Reuters poll predicted world growth of 4.2 percent
this year and 4.3 percent in 2012, unchanged since the January
poll. See [ID:nLDE73D0XY]

day, while Wall Street stocks dipped 0.1 percent, though they
were off earlier lows.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2011 03:12PM ET</span>",UAE's Royal Group eyes projects in Russia's Chechnya," * Royal Group eyes 5-star hotel, housing, sports complexes
 * Investment to boost ties between Chechnya, Muslim nations
 
 GROZNY, Russia, April 14 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi-based Royal
Group is eyeing investments in Russia's Muslim Chechnya region
including a luxury hotel and a sports complex, the Chechen
government said on Thursday.
 ""A delegation of one of the largest construction companies
of the United Arab Emirates 'Royal Group' was in Grozny recently
to determine areas for the construction of a modern five-star
hotel, sports facility and a housing complex,"" said a statement
from the press service of the Chechen leadership.
 Chechnya is part of a patchwork of mainly Muslim republics
that make up Russia's volatile North Caucasus, home to an
Islamist insurgency whose most prominent leader claimed
responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed 37 people at
Moscow's busiest airport in January.
 Its Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, had earlier asked
the United Arab Emirates to invest 68.9 billion roubles ($2.44
billion) in some 17 projects, mostly hydro-electric power
plants, in the province on Russia's southern border.
 The Royal Group delegation toured Chechnya's capital,
Grozny, before heading to the mountains surrounding the city to
find a site for a potential sports facility, the statement said.
 It quoted the Royal Group's manager for sports construction
as saying it wanted to build a sports complex where athletes
from the United Arab Emirates and other Arab countries could
train for international competitions.
 Royal Group was not immediately available to comment.
 The investors were shown a potential 45-hectare area in
Grozny for the hotel and housing complex.
 The Kremlin has poured money into the North Caucasus, where
unemployment in some areas exceeds 50 percent, in the hope of
keeping its youth out of the insurgency. Moscow has budgeted 152
billion roubles for Chechnya from 2008-2012.
 Chechen leader Kadyrov, who has spearheaded the region's
drive to attract Arab investment, is credited with maintaining a
shaky peace a decade after Russian troops drove separatists out
of power in the second of two post-Soviet wars.
 But Kadyrov's critics say he is pursuing a violent crackdown
on opponents and enforcing his vision of Islam with rules that
sometimes violate secular Russia's constitution. He dismisses
the accusations as attempts to blacken his name.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - The dollar dropped broadly
on Thursday, reaching a record low against the Swiss franc,
with more weakness likely so long as U.S. Federal Reserve and
European Central bank policies continue to diverge.
 U.S. economic numbers kept intact expectations the Federal
Reserve's $600 billion asset-buying program will stay in place
until June. [ID:nN14146589]
 The Fed's second round of quantitative easing, called QE2,
has been a bane for the U.S. dollar as it is tantamount to
printing money.
 The euro, in contrast, remains supported by the prospect of
higher interest rates in the euro zone despite comments by
Germany that Greece may need to restructure its debt
[ID:nLDE73C28V].
 Top ECB policymakers sent fresh warnings about rising euro
zone inflation risks on Thursday, with one likening the current
economic situation to that at the start of the bank's last rate
hike cycle in 2005. The ECB raised rates to 1.25 percent last
Thursday. [nLDE73D1EW]
 The ICE Futures' dollar index dropped to a fresh 16-month
low at 74.617 <.DXY>. In early afternoon, it was down 0.4
percent at 74.714.

 The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4484  in
volatile trading. It was trading lower earlier following a
resurgence of sovereign debt fears.
 ""The dollar remains under pressure without a doubt. Even
though we have these headlines on Greece, it's not necessarily
harming the euro,"" said John McCarthy, director of currency
trading at ING Capital Markets in New York.
 ""The market to some extent is ignoring these headlines or

 * Would aim to make money: Chamber of Commerce official
 * U.S. business community also looking at Egypt, Tunisia
 WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah II
has reached out to U.S. companies in the wake of political
turmoil sweeping the Middle East to help create new jobs for
his country, U.S. business leaders said on Thursday.
 ""This king understands that times have changed, understands
what's going on in the region, knows that he needs to respond
to that,"" Myron Brilliant, senior vice president for
international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told
reporters at a briefing on his recent trip to Jordan.
 U.S. trade with Jordan has grown rapidly to more than $1
billion annually in the 11 years since the two countries signed
a free trade agreement. But U.S. foreign investment in the
country remains relatively modest, Brilliant said.
 Brilliant said the U.S. Chamber received an invitation from
Abdullah's royal court to bring a team of U.S. companies to
Amman to discuss business opportunities.
 The group told the king and his top ministers that they
wanted to help but would not pour investment into the country
""unless we can make money,"" Brilliant said.
 That said, Jordan is a ""stable, progressive"" country that
has great potential as a tourist destination and as a base for
doing business in the region, he said.
 There are other opportunities for U.S. companies in helping
Jordan develop its infrastructure and in the healthcare sector,
Brilliant said.
 Lionel Johnson, the business group's vice president for
Middle East affairs, said the U.S. private sector also is
looking for opportunities in Egypt and Tunisia, where massive
protests have brought new governments to power, he said.
 ""We feel that our responsibility is to enable the new
governments that are coming to office to have at least a
fighting chance to deliver on the promise of democracy,""
Johnson said.

 * Kirk says decision on sanctions against EU to come later
 By Andrew Stern
 CHICAGO, April 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Trade Representative
left little doubt on Thursday that the Obama administration
would appeal a World Trade Organization ruling that Boeing
 received illegal government subsidies.
 Ron Kirk promised to ""protect our interests"" when asked on
the sidelines of a speech in Chicago whether the administration
would appeal the March 31 ruling that Boeing received at least
$5.3 billion in illegal subsidies in the long-running dispute.
 ""We don't discuss our legal strategies in the WTO but we
are examining that role and making sure we protect our
interests,"" Kirk told reporters. ""If you look at the fairly
aggressive posture we've taken over the last 14 years, I think
you can draw a reasonable conclusion"" about an appeal of the
WTO ruling.
 Kirk emphasized that the WTO had ruled previously that
Boeing rival Airbus  had received at least $20 billion
in illegal subsidies, a ruling that both sides have appealed.
 Analysts have anticipated a U.S. appeal of the Boeing
ruling, which the European Commission hailed as a ""clear-cut
victory."" Europe also appealed because it believes the
subsidies to be higher.
 The United States was unlikely to accept the Boeing
decision to put pressure on the European Union to accept the
Airbus ruling, the analysts said.
 Looking ahead, Kirk said any decision on imposing trade
sanctions on EU goods would come later, likely after the
appeals process plays out and the EU weighs its options.
Alternatively, the EU could institute a ""cure"" to the subsidy
problem, he said.
 The WTO appellate body is expected to issue its decision in
the Airbus case in late April, although decision dates
frequently slip at the WTO.
 Once that ruling comes, the United States will have a
timing advantage in the dispute because the EU could soon face
U.S. retaliation if it does not move quickly to eliminate any
subsidies left standing by the appellate review.
 Many analysts believe the two sides will eventually
negotiate a settlement, rather than hurl sanctions potentially
affecting billions of dollars and possibly setting off a trade
war.
 A deal also would bolster U.S. ties with Europe at a time
when both face increased competition from emerging economies
such as China, India and Brazil.
 ""A negotiated resolution would be the best thing,"" Kirk
said. ""But we will not yield on our position that the European
Union has to allow Airbus to go out and compete on commercially
acceptable terms.""

212,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2011 12:52PM ET</span>",Republicans responsible if U.S. defaults -Geithner," WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner on Thursday told Republican lawmakers that they would
shoulder the blame if the country got too close to defaulting
on its debt and roiled markets worldwide by not approving a
debt limit increase.
 In yet another warning about the perils of not allowing the
U.S. to borrow more to fund already spending already approved
by Congress, Geithner said it would be deeply irresponsible for
lawmakers to use debt limit negotiations for political gains.
 Congress must agree to raise the $14.3 trillion debt
ceiling or the legal amount that the country can borrow. But
Republicans have said they are unwilling to do so without
reforms on government spending and have threatened to take
negotiations to the deadline.
 ""(Lawmakers) will say there's leverage in it, we can
advance it. But that would be deeply irresponsible and they
will own the risk,"" Geithner said.
 ""It won't happen in the end, but if they take it too close
to the edge, they will own responsibility for that
miscalculation,"" he said.
 Treasury has forecast that the limit will be reached by May
16. After that point, Treasury can take emergency measures to
avoid hitting the debt ceiling. But those actions will only
give the United States about a two-month window before Treasury
is unable to issue debt to fund government operations.
 Geithner said lawmakers ""understand that you can't take any
risk the world starts to think the United States won't meet its
obligations.""
 ""There's no conceivable way that this city, this government
can court that basic risk,"" he said.

 * Euro turns higher vs dollar in choppy trading
 * Dollar index hits 16-month low
 * Dollar below 200-day MA vs yen; QE2 seen staying put
 * U.S. jobless claims higher than expected
(Recasts, updates prices, adds quote)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday
in choppy trading and further losses were seen as likely, hurt
by reported central bank selling amid a backdrop of low U.S.
interest rates that were not expected to rise any time soon.
 Recent U.S. economic numbers, including jobless claims
and retail sales, have come in on the soft side, which kept
intact expectations the Federal Reserve's $600 billion
asset-buying program would stay in place until June.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index dropped to a fresh 16-month
low at 74.617. At midday, it was down 0.2 percent at 74.827.
 The euro, in contrast, remained supported by the prospect
of higher interest rates in the euro zone despite the
re-emergence of peripheral debt issues. Central banks were
said to be buyers of the euro against the greenback as they
looked to recycle their dollar proceeds in their reserves.
 ""The dollar remains under pressure without a doubt. Even
though we have these headlines on Greece, it's not necessarily
harming the euro,"" said John McCarthy, director of currency
trading at ING Capital Markets in New York.
 ""The market to some extent is ignoring these headlines or
investors simply believe Europe can solve its problems. People
are just selling dollar on rallies and buying euros on dips.""
 The yen, meanwhile, continued its broad surge as investors
pared short positions on the Japanese currency, which has
tumbled the last few weeks after G7 intervention last month.
 The dollar, in particular, was badly hit by the yen's
strength, especially following data on U.S. initial jobless
claims, which were higher than expected in the latest week.
 ""The data ... errs on the softer side, and there is
nothing here to change a view that the yen will be the
beneficiary of any data that pushes Fed hikes further into the
future, especially on a day when squeezes on yen crosses is
the key,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of FX strategy at
Deutsche Bank.
 The greenback's losses pushed it below its 200-day moving
average near 83.43 yen as investors cut sizable long positions
built after the U.S. currency's speedy ascent from its record
low of 76.25 in March.
 In midday trading, the dollar fell against the yen,
trading down 0.7 percent at 83.25 yen.
 One trader cited real money offers above 83.50 yen with
further falls likely to target the 100-day moving average at
around 82.72 yen.
 Goldman Sachs in a monthly report kept its forecasts for
dollar/yen unchanged, with the pair seen rising to 90 yen in
12 months. Overall, Goldman remained bearish on the dollar
with the U.S. bank targeting euro/dollar to rise to $1.50 in
12 months.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.4459 in volatile
trading. It was trading lower earlier following a resurgence
of sovereign debt fears.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble acknowledged
officially for the first time on Wednesday that Greece may
have to restructure its debt, a move that European Central
Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said would be
a catastrophe.
 Later on Thursday, a high-ranking German government
official did damage control, saying Schaeuble's comments made
in a newspaper do not signal a change in Germany's position on
a possible restructuring of Greek debt.
 Traders said the fall below $1.4450 in euro/dollar
triggered stop-loss orders and accelerated selling after it
had earlier failed to test Wednesday's 15-month peak of
$1.4521 and an options barrier at $1.4530. In early New York
trading, support was seen around $1.4250-80, the base formed
before last week's euro-zone rate hike pushed it higher.

 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world
markets fell and the U.S. dollar slipped on Thursday as
Greece's debt problem, Chinese inflation and disappointing U.S.
jobs data stoked worries over a global economic slowdown.
 Bonds and gold rose as uneasy investors shifted funds into
less risky investments.

is more concerned about what growth will be like with rising

 U.S. oil prices climbed on the weaker dollar.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.3 percent despite a burst of corporate
activity that would usually lift investors' spirits. On a
year-to-date basis, the index was still up 4.1 percent.

Wall Street stocks were <.SPX> down 0.3 percent.
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei <.N225> bucked the trend, closing up

 Selling in European stocks emerged on a report that Chinese
inflation would re-accelerate after slowing recently. Investors
are particularly concerned about Chinese inflation in case the
government attempts to restrain it by raising interest rates
prompts a 'hard landing' for the economy.
 ""In emerging markets especially China, they rely on high
levels of oil imports. They import a lot of oil products into
the manufacturing sector,"" said Chris Ferrarone, global equity
strategist with UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, citing an unnamed source, said
China's annual rate of inflation in March was likely to be 5.3
percent to 5.4 percent, a 32-month high and just above an
estimate in a Reuters poll. [ID:nL3E7FE0EO]

 By Mette Fraende and Teis Jensen
 COPENHAGEN, April 14 (Reuters) - Carlsberg will not sit back
and watch when the brewery sector consolidates in the future,
and could raise 40-50 billion Danish crowns ($7.72 billion -
$9.65 billion) for acquisitions, its chairman said.
 Expecting a big consolidation wave in the future, Chairman
Povl Krogsgaard-Larsen told Reuters in an interview on Thursday
that Carlsberg is well prepared to take the next step, after its
58 billion crowns acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle in 2008.
 ""Of course Carlsberg can raise a significant amount of
capital, but this is not a signal that an acquisition is
impending,"" said Krogsgaard-Larsen, chairman of the world's
fourth biggest brewer after Anheuser-Busch InBev, SABMiller and
Heineken.
 ""We don't have any such plans at this moment.""
 Various figures have floated around about how much Carlsberg
could spend when it goes on the acquisitions path again.
 Asked if Carlsberg could today raise 40-50 billion crowns
for acquisitions, Krogsgaard-Larsen said ""depending on the
parameters included in raising capital, it is likely about that
size.""
 ""We have now paid down our debt to a manageable level...so
that the day it becomes necessary, debt will not be a big
problem,"" Krogsgaard-Larsen said.
 ""All the big brewers know that it (consolidation) will come
in the future and are looking at their puzzles to see where
there will be opportunities. Everyone is looking at that now,""
he said.
 ""As a large player Carlsberg cannot, when this happens, sit
back and watch.""
 Consolidation would occur because large scale is decisive
for the world's brewers, Krogsgaard-Larsen said. 
 ""Large scale is a factor which is of very big importance to
earnings,"" he said.
 
 ASIAN GROWTH PROSPECTS
 World brewers, juggling rising raw materials prices and
slowing growth in mature markets, are seeking growth elsewhere
and aiming to pass on rising input costs to consumers.
 Carlsberg's beer volumes in Eastern Europe fell organically
by 9 percent last year, while Asian beer markets, largely
unaffected by the 2009 economic crisis, saw 14 percent organic
volume growth, Carlsberg said in its 2010 earnings report.
 Carlsberg owns 35 breweries in Asia of which 19 are in
China, six in Vietnam and five in India.
 ""In the Far East, primarily China and Vietnam, and all of
Southeast Asia, there is a large focus for Carlsberg,"" the
chairman said, adding there were no obvious acquisition targets
in Europe.
 ""There is no doubt that Carlsberg constantly has its eyes on
Western China where we are in a strong position and pleased to
see that China's 'Go West' policy remains intact,""
Krogsgaard-Larsen said.
 Eastern Europe accounts for about 44 percent of Carlsberg's
total beer volume, Northern and Western Europe for about 43
percent and Asia the remaining 13 percent.
 ""The 13 percent will become more. We would like it to become
as large as possible...we will see significant growth,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on
Thursday, undermined by concerns Greece could be forced to
restructure its massive debt, although the currency's losses
may be capped by a higher interest rate outlook in the euro
zone.
 The yen, however, continued its broad surge as investors
pared short positions on the Japanese currency, which has
fallen sharply the last few weeks in the wake of the G7
intervention last month.
 The dollar, in particular, was badly hit by the yen's
strength, especially following data on U.S. initial jobless
claims, which were higher than expected in the latest week.
 The greenback's losses pushed it below its 200-day moving
average near 83.43 yen as investors cut sizable long positions
built after the U.S. currency's speedy ascent from its record
low of 76.25 in March.
 ""Overall, in terms of the euro, we have seen a return of
the risk premium on some of the periphery debt,"" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble acknowledged
officially for the first time on Wednesday that Greece may have
to restructure its debt, a move that European Central Bank
Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said would be a
catastrophe.
 ECB policymaker Juergen Stark also warned Irish banks
cannot rely on ECB emergency funding indefinitely.
 ""On the back of that we have seen a large rise in the risk
premium of these peripheral countries, with bond yields going
up relative to Germany,"" McCormick said.
 Greek bond yields soared on Thursday, with short-dated
paper coming under the most pressure. The cost of insuring
against a Greek sovereign default also rose to a record high.
 EURO SELLING
 Traders said the fall below $1.4450 in euro/dollar
triggered stop-loss orders and accelerated selling after it had
earlier failed to test Wednesday's 15-month peak of $1.4521 and
an options barrier at $1.4530. In early New York trading, it
was down 0.1 percent at $1.4423.
 Support was seen around $1.4250-80, the base formed before
last week's euro zone rate hike pushed it higher.
 The dollar stayed not far from an earlier 16-month low
against a currency basket. Recent U.S. economic numbers,
including jobless claims and retail sales, have come in on the
soft side, which kept intact expectations the Federal Reserve's
$600 billion asset-buying program would stay in place until
June.
 The dollar index was little changed at at 74.947, having
earlier fallen to 74.617, bringing its losses this year to
around 5 percent. The next target is seen at 74.17, the low hit
on Nov 26, 2009.
 The dollar fell against the yen, trading down 0.9 percent
at 83.14 yen.
 The greenback also extended losses against the yen
following the jobless claims data.
 ""The data ... errs on the softer side, and there is nothing
here to change a view that the yen will be the beneficiary of
any data that pushes Fed hikes further into the future,
especially on a day when squeezes on yen crosses is the key,""

the U.S. bank targeting euro/dollar to rise to $1.50 in 12
months.

(Adds comment from reconstruction panel head)	
 By Linda Sieg and Mayumi Negishi	
 TOKYO, April 14 (Reuters) - Japan's fragile post-disaster
political truce unravelled on Thursday as the head of the main
opposition party called on unpopular Prime Minister Naoto Kan to
quit over his handling of the country's natural calamities and a
nuclear crisis.	
 At the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant in the northeast of
the country, engineers were struggling to find a new way to cool
one of the six crippled reactors and Japan's Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency said it was now ""highly likely"" there
was a hole in the suppression unit of the reactor.	
 Kan, whose public support stands at about 30 percent, had
sought a grand coalition to help the country recover from its
worst ever natural disaster and enact bills to pay for the
country's biggest reconstruction project since World War Two.	
 Kan's Democratic Party controls parliament's lower house but
needs opposition help to pass bills because it lacks a majority
in the upper chamber, which can block legislation.	
 But the head of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) -- who last week ruled out joining hands -- on Thursday
pressured Kan to go.	
 ""The time has come for (the prime minister) to decide
whether he stays or goes,"" Kyodo news agency quoted Sadakazu
Tanigaki as telling a news conference.	


 Tanigaki's comment reflects the view of many in his
conservative party that Kan must step down as a precondition for
any coalition as well as a hope that criticism of Kan within his
own Democratic Party will gather steam after party powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa blasted the premier over his crisis management.	
 Upper House speaker Takeo Nishioka, a well-known Kan critic
from the Democrats, also urged Kan to resign, Kyodo said.	
 Kan, however, who took office as Japan's fifth leader since
2006 last June, is not likely to step down readily, while
opposition parties could come under fire if they try to take
disaster budgets hostage in a political battle, analysts said.	
 ""Kan will probably ignore this,"" said Koichi Nakano, a
Sophia University professor. ""If they thought of the national
interests, would they (Kan's critics) do this now?""	
 
 STILL NO CLOSER TO SOLVING NUCLEAR CRISIS	
 Five weeks ago a massive earthquake and tsunami left nearly
28,000 dead or missing, devastated a broad swathe of northeast
Japan and damaged the Fukushima nuclear plant. There has been no
sign of a resolution of the atomic crisis.	
 The nuclear safety agency said a new plan for cooling one of
six reactors at the plant, 240 km (150 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, may be needed due to the large volume of highly
radioactive water on site, and tests would be done to determine
if damaged spent fuel rods were emitting radiation.	
 ""It may be difficult to completely remove the contaminated
water and so allow work to proceed (in restoring power to the
cooling pumps). We may need to think of other options,"" said
Hidehiko Nishiyama, a deputy director-general of Japan's Nuclear
Industry and Safety Authority.	
 Nishiyama said there was 20,000 tonnes of contaminated water
in the basement and a tunnel under reactor No. 2. 
 ""What makes the No.2 unit decisively different from No.1 and
No.3 units are that it is highly likely that there is a hole on
the (No.2 unit's) suppression chamber after as an explosion was
heard. It would be an accurate speculation that there is
leakage."" 
 Engineers are also concerned that some spent fuel rods were
damaged by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and could be
emitting high levels of radiation.	
 Japan's nuclear crisis has been rated on par with the
world's worst nuclear crisis at Chernobyl in 1986, although the
total amount of radiation released is only a fraction of that
when the nuclear plant in Ukraine exploded.	
 Japan has expanded a 20-km (12-mile) evacuation zone around
the plant because of high accumulated radiation. No
radiation-linked deaths have been reported and only 21 plant
workers have been affected by minor radiation sickness.	
 A series of strong aftershocks this week has rattled eastern
Japan, slowing the recovery effort at the plant due to temporary
evacuations of workers and power outages.	
 The total cost of the damage has been estimated at $300
billion, making it the world's most costly natural disaster.	
 Makoto Iokibe, head of a newly created government panel
tasked to come up with a revival plan, floated the idea of
setting up a special reconstruction tax in addition to bond
sales and donations as ways to fund the bill.	
 ""Given the potential scale of the cost, it might need to be
shouldered by the entire Japanese people. That's why I
mentioned (the special tax). But nothing concrete has been
decided,"" Iokibe told a news conference after the panel's first
meeting.	
 Business confidence plunged to a record low in April,
according to a Reuters survey, and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has warned the risk to the world's third largest
economy is firmly on the downside. [ID:nLME7DP00Q]	
 The IMF cut Japan's economic growth forecast to 1.4 percent
this year from 1.6 percent, projected three months ago, and the
Bank of Japan is expected to cut its January growth forecast of
1.6 percent when it issues its twice-yearly outlook on April 28.

 * Growth to be 0.4 percent for four quarters
 * ECB to raise rates by 25 basis points per quarter
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - The euro zone economic recovery
picked up pace last quarter, buoyed by a resurgent Germany, but
the upturn is coming at a cost and the growth rate will ease
over the remainder of 2011, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
 The 17-nation bloc's economy grew 0.5 percent in the first
three months of the year, according to the poll of over 40
analysts taken in the past week and in line with a March survey.
 The forecast for faster growth than the lacklustre 0.3
percent seen in the dying months of 2010 is supported by strong
upward revisions to Germany's economic outlook and comes despite
periphery economies continuing to struggle.
 Economic growth is expected to slow to 0.4 percent per
quarter until the current period next year when it will tick
back up to 0.5 percent, in line with last month's outlook.
 ""Higher inflation and significant fiscal tightening will
continue to constrain the recovery despite the resurgence in
global manufacturing,"" said James Nixon at Societe Generale.
 The European Central Bank upped interest rates by 25 basis
points from their record low of 1.0 percent last week. It is
seen making similar increases once per quarter through to
September next year, with rates ending 2012 at 2.5 percent, in
line with a poll taken after the rate hike.
 ""In a strong signal that the governing members of the ECB
are more worried about the threat to inflation and less worried
about the growth implications, the ECB began its tightening,""
said Bruce Kasman at JP Morgan.
 Despite the expected rate rises, economists revised up their
forecasts for inflation and now see prices rising 2.4 percent
this year, up from a 2.2 percent prediction just last month, as
booming oil, food and commodity prices weigh on minds.
 The ECB targets inflation just below 2 percent.
 Gross domestic product is expected to grow 1.7 percent this
year and next, with the 2011 outlook unchanged from last month
and the 2012 forecast revised down 10 basis points.
 The euro zone's economic outlook compares to 1.5 and 2.2
percent growth seen for major trading partner Britain but pales
compared to the 2.9 and 3.0 forecasts for growth in the United
States.
 Japan's economy is expected to contract in the current
quarter after last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami
but perk up again in July-September on reconstruction efforts,
and the disaster will have little impact on Europe.
 ""Japan accounts for less than 1 percent of euro area
exports. The trade effects are therefore likely to be fairly
limited,"" Nixon said.
 
 PERIPHERY PALLS
 Service sector companies powered ahead in March at their
fastest rate since August 2007 but there was a marked contrast
between strength in France and Germany, Europe's largest
economy, and weakness elsewhere.
 The struggling periphery economies are facing weak domestic
demand, hampered by austerity measures and political uncertainty
that have heightened financial strife.
 Portugal became the latest bloc member to ask for a bailout
last week, following in the footsteps of Greece and Ireland, as
months of resistance to foreign aid led to credit rating
downgrades and a sharp rise in borrowing costs.
 The poll gave a median 60 percent chance that Greece will
restructure its debt in the next few years, but only a 30
percent chance that Portugal will the same. The poll found a 40
percent chance of an Irish restructuring.
 Despite the slight economic downgrade, analysts revised down
their unemployment forecasts for the euro zone, to 9.8 percent
this year and 9.5 percent next. That compared with 9.9 and 9.6
percent forecasts in January and an actual figure of 9.9 percent
in February.

 By Toni Vorobyova and Paul Carrel
 MOSCOW/LJUBLJANA, April 14 (Reuters) - Top ECB policymakers
sent fresh warnings about rising euro zone inflation risks on
Thursday, with one likening the current economic situation to
that at the start of the bank's last rate hike cycle in 2005.
 The ECB raised rates to 1.25 percent last Thursday,
beginning what financial markets expect to be a steady run of
hikes despite assurances from the bank's President Jean-Claude
Trichet that a cycle of increases is not pre-programmed.
 ECB Executive Board members Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo and
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi both focused on rising euro zone inflation
on Thursday, fuelling expectations among economists that the
bank will raise rates again in either June or July.
 ""Risks to growth are balanced, inflation (risks are) to the
upside,"" Gonzalez-Paramo told reporters on the sidelines of the
Risk & Return Russia conference in Moscow.
 ""Oil prices are the main driver of the recent increase in
inflation. The expectation in the market is that oil will not go
down quickly.""
 In an interview with Reuters, Slovenia's ECB policymaker,
Marko Kranjec said the bank's monetary policy was still ""very
accommodative"" after last week's rate rise and that the
financial system remained well stocked with ECB funding.
 Bini Smaghi, who has been a pacemaker for the ECB's rate
hike rhetoric this year, said in an interview with Italian paper
Il Sole 24 Ore that the current macro economic backdrop mirrored
that of 2005, when the ECB launched a series of hikes that
raised rates from 2 percent to 4 percent in 1-1/2 years.
 ""We are at the end of an easing cycle with very low interest
rates, as in 2005,"" he said, defending the increases back then
and also the bank's often-criticised additional hike in 2008
just before the collapse of the global economy.
 ""The minimum levels at which the interest rates were
standing were justified by the 2009 recession and the risks of
deflation. As we move away from those risks, the less justified
these interest rate levels are.""
 
 RATE EXPECTATIONS
 There were renewed signs of higher inflation in China on
Thursday, underlining the rise in global price pressures as
economies put 2008's financial turmoil behind them. The ECB's
monthly bulletin warned that the ongoing geopolitical tensions
could also put upward pressure on oil prices, and as a result,
euro zone inflation.
 ""Political turmoil in the Middle East, North Africa region
presents a downside risk for economic activity and an upside
risk to price developments in the euro area in the short run,""
it said.
 Gonzalez-Paramo and Kranjec gave little away on the
likelihood of further rate hikes, contrasting with other ECB
rate-setters who recently signalled the bank is ready to tighten
monetary policy again in coming months.
 The majority of economists and investors currently see the
ECB raising interest rates twice more this year to 1.75 percent,
but recent tough talk from policymakers has seen some experts
shorten the odds of earlier hikes and squeezing in a third one.
 The euro hit a 15-month high against the dollar this week as
markets eyed the impact of the growing divergence between euro
zone and U.S. monetary policy.
 Bini Smaghi downplayed the single currency's 11 percent rise
since January, however, saying that against the world's major
currencies, it was: ""at the same level as in 2005 in nominal
effective terms and about 10 percent lower in real terms.""
 
 DEBT ZONE
 Euro zone trouble spots Greece, Ireland and Portugal also
came under the ECB spotlight following media reports this month
that politicians are increasingly considering the prospect of a
possible debt restructuring in Greece.
 Bini Smaghi warned that any move by Athens to restructure
its debt would have catastrophic effects, ruining its banks and
crippling its economy.
 Gonzalez-Paramo meanwhile stuck to the official line that
Greece should be able to return to open markets early next year
if it follows its EU and IMF bailout programme.
 To coincide with an ECB, IMF and EU trip to inspect Dublin's
finances, ECB board member Juergen Stark sent a thinly veiled
warning to the country's government, saying emergency central
bank aid for Irish banks could not last forever and that burning
senior bank bondholders risked igniting problems elsewhere in
the euro zone..
 ""The role of the ECB is to provide liquidity but you cannot
say, okay, it is all up to the ECB to fund the Irish banks,""
Stark said in an interview with the Irish Independent.
 ""It is not a healthy situation that we are providing
liquidity of up to 100 percent of GDP to the Irish banks,"" he
added.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - The euro turned lower against
the dollar on Thursday, dented by speculation that Greece and
possibly Ireland may be forced to restructure their massive
debts, pushing peripheral euro zone bond yields higher.
 Re-emerging concerns about debt problems in peripheral euro
zone countries pushed the euro down as low as $1.4365 , a
cent-and-a-half below the day's high above $1.45.
 Analysts expected falls to be limited, however, with the
euro still supported by expectations for higher euro zone
interest rates while U.S. policy stays loose. 
 Traders said the fall below $1.4450 triggered stop-loss
orders and accelerated selling after it had earlier failed to
test Wednesday's 15-month peak of $1.4521 and an options barrier
at $1.4530. It was last down 0.4 percent at $1.4388.
 ""The market tends to react to reports like this when the
euro is at overstretched levels and this leads to some
consolidation, but overall the medium-term trends are likely to
stay in place,"" said Stephan Maier, currency strategist at
Unicredit.
 ""For the euro to get to $1.42, the level before last week's
ECB rate hike, we would need some dovish news from the ECB or an
extremely bullish U.S. PPI number"".
 Support was seen around $1.4250-80, the base formed before
last week's euro zone rate hike pushed it higher.

time that Athens may need to restructure its debt, a move

cannot rely on ECB emergency funding indefinitely. [ID:nWLA8110]

 DOLLAR/YEN WEAKER
 The dollar stayed not far from an earlier 16-month low
against a currency basket after U.S. retail sales data and the
Fed's Beige Book report on Wednesday kept intact expectations
the central bank's $600 billion asset-buying programme would
stay in place until June.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.1 percent at 75.086, having
earlier fallen to 74.617, bringing its losses this year to
around 5 percent. The next target is seen at 74.17, the low hit
on Nov 26., 2009.
 U.S. producer prices data is due at 1230 GMT, but its impact
was expected to be limited. 
 The dollar fell against the yen, trading down 1 percent at
83.04 yen . It broke below its 200-day moving average near
83.43 yen as investors cut sizeable long positions built after
the U.S. currency's speedy ascent from its record low of 76.25
in March.
 One trader cited real money offers above 83.50 yen with
further falls likely to target the 100-day moving average at
around 82.72 yen.
 ""The dollar will continue to be undermined by the monetary
policy stance of the Fed,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency
analyst at Credit Agricole.
 Goldman Sachs in a monthly report kept its forecasts for
dollar/yen unchanged, with the pair seen rising to 90 yen in 12
months. Overall, Goldman remained bearish on the dollar with the
U.S. bank targeting euro/dollar to rise to $1.50 in 12 months.
 In contrast to the loose Fed policy, the European Central
Bank is expected to follow up its April interest rate hike with
more tightening later this year. Markets are pricing in a better
than 50 percent chance the ECB will hike in August.

 * Spectre of 'twin deficit' unsettles Poland investors
 * Hungary getting benefit of doubt on controversial reforms
 
 By Caroline Copley
 LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - Lingering doubts over the
quality of its trade data and a persistent failure to adopt
rigorous fiscal reforms could keep Poland's investment prospects
clouded -- possibly to the benefit of regional peer Hungary.
 Though the Polish zloty has rebounded from recent lows
against the euro and the Hungarian forint, investors are
increasingly adopting a view that Hungary is becoming a better
medium term bet than Poland.
 It is already noticeable on their stock markets.
 Shares in Budapest <.BUX> have risen more than 12 percent
this year, dwarfing Warsaw's 6 percent, despite the latter's
push towards the privatisation of state assets and efforts to
help fund the budget with extra corporate taxation.
 ""In the regional beauty contest, Poland is losing its top
spot. Poland had been doing well going into the financial crisis
but a lot of complacency has set in,"" said Lars Christensen,
chief emerging markets analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
 ""There's an underlying deterioration in Polish fundamentals
and an underlying improvement in Hungarian fundamentals.""
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic comparing Polish and Hungarian CDS:
 http://r.reuters.com/hug98r
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Continued confusion over the size of the Poland's current
account deficit -- a central bank official has warned a revision
of the balance of payments data could increase the current
account deficit by at least 1 percent of GDP - has crystalised
investors' displeasure over the government's complacency in
tackling its finances. [ID::nLDE73A0V8]
 ""There is the issue of large errors in the trade data and
also it's running large twin deficits -- that means the zloty
will remain undervalued. We were already concerned before the
admission,"" said David Dowsett, who manages $10 billion in
emerging market investment at BlueBay Asset Management.
 The zloty -- the region's worst performing currency so far
this year -- fell almost 10 percent against the forint
 between mid-January and the start of April to
15-month lows, and plumbed 8-month lows against the euro
 in mid-March.
 
 MIND THE GAP
 A more hawkish tone from Poland's central bank coupled with
expectations of more dovish policy from Budapest have prompted
some investors to close zloty-forint short positions. 
 Much of the zloty's losses can be seen as a retracement of a
bullish performance last year, and Poland remains the region's
most robust economy with lower public debt and a better growth
outlook than Hungary.
 But Warsaw's plan to issue a June revision of 2010 balance
of payments data is unlikely to quell disquiet, already
heightened by growing expectations the government will fall
short of its pledge to cut its budget deficit to 3 percent of
GDP in 2012 from 8 percent now.
 ""We saw a few recommendations in the street to go long
PLNHUF, but we are still not comfortable enough to add PLN
exposure amidst the noise around the Polish BoP (balance of
payment) dynamics,"" Luis Costa, Citi analyst said in a note.
 This view was echoed by Murat Toprak, emerging markets
strategist at HSBC: ""There has been a shift in the Polish
central bank towards a more hawkish stance but I still wouldn't
buy the zloty yet.""
 Rating agencies have also stepped up the finger-wagging.
Fitch and Standard & Poor's have both warned inaction on fiscal
reform could lead to negative ratings action for Poland.
 Radical cuts to government spending, however, are unlikely
until after parliamentary elections in October, especially as
the ruling party has only a narrow lead over its rivals.
[ID:nLDE737115]
 ""There will be no real fiscal reform before the elections,""
said Toprak.
 ""We haven't seen any real fiscal reform in Poland other than
the changes to the pension system, which effectively reduce
contributions to private pensions.""
 
 BENEFIT OF DOUBT
 Hungary, by contrast, is becoming more popular.
 Poland's pension reforms were initially received more
positively by investors compared with Hungary's pension reforms,
which were part of a series of controversial fiscal measures
including windfall taxes on sectors such as banking.
But investors are now adopting a wait-and-see approach on
the Hungarian measures, which they contrast with the relative
absence of Polish initiatives to curb spending.
 ""Poland is not that bad but at this point Hungary looks much
more attractive,"" said Marten-Jan Bakkum, emerging markets
investment strategist at ING Investment Management, who is
overweight Hungary.
 While Poland's 5-year CDS have stalled at around 142 bps,
Hungary's have tightened to 249 basis points from 388 bps at the
start of the year.
 Hoping to capitalise on this shift in sentiment, Hungary
said this week it plans a roadshow with European investors with
a view to possibly issuing a euro-denominated foreign currency
bond to cover the remainder of its financing costs this year.
 Recent 10- and 30-year dollar bond sales from Hungary in the
past month have seen strong demand in global markets, though
Poland also said on Thursday it planned a dollar bond.
 ""The biggest turnaround story in central Europe is
(Hungary). We were cautious and didn't think the new ...
government was serious about meaningful reform but we have
changed our view on that this year,"" BlueBay's Dowsett said.

 * Reserves to grow further on trade income, yuan regime
 * Analysts say China needs to let yuan rise faster
 * International pressure on Beijing likely to grow

 By Koh Gui Qing and Aileen Wang	
 BEIJING, April 8 (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange
reserves have topped $3-trillion-and-counting, stoking
inflation, knocking the economy off kilter and leaving the
country's money managers with an impossible assignment.	
 At first glance, the eye-watering stockpile appears to be a
symbol of China's fast-growing wealth. But on deeper inspection,
the vast cash holdings are an unflattering testament to much
that is wrong in the world's second-largest economy.	
 They reveal how undervalued the yuan is, how inflation could
soar in the future and how much more the government could be
investing at home to engender sustainable growth, analysts say.	
 The People's Bank of China said on Thursday that its foreign
exchange holdings, already the world's biggest, increased by
$197 billion in the first quarter to $3.05 trillion. They are
now nearly triple Japan's holdings, the world's second-biggest
official currency reserves.	
 ""It's clearly too much, it's clearly excess to needs, and
more importantly, it's damaging to the economy,"" said Stephen
Green, an economist at Standard Chartered.	
 In the last decade, China's gaping trade surpluses and its
incessant buying of dollars to suppress the yuan's value
have led the reserves to balloon 17-fold.	
 For every dollar that goes into reserves, China prints about
6.5 yuan, adding even more cash to its economy. This is worrying
since China is already at pains to drain excess money, with
inflation running near its fastest in three years.	
 ""Every new dollar of foreign exchange reserves is every new
dollar of base money. And that drives up inflation,"" Green said.	
 
 ""TOO HIGH A COST""	
 To neutralise all the money that has been created, China has
conducted what are known as ""sterilisation operations"". Its
primary weapon has been to increase banks' reserve requirements,
forcing them to lock up cash that they would otherwise lend.	
 Required reserves are already at a record 20 percent of
deposits for China's biggest banks, denting their profitability,
and analysts believe that the room for further increases is
limited. [ID:nL3E7EM081]	
 By most estimates, China only needs about $780 billion of
reserves. That would be sufficient to pay for three months of
imports and to cover all of China's short-term foreign debt --
the standard metrics of how much countries should hold in
reserves as a form of insurance in case of a financial crisis.	
 Yet the stockpile has grown so big because China refuses to
let the yuan rise faster for fear of hurting its exports, much
to the frustration of its trading partners, especially the
United States.	
 But it is also a problem domestically. It runs directly
counter to China's need to boost consumption to cope with tepid
growth in its major export markets, said Li Jie, a researcher at
the Central University of Finance and Economics.	
 ""It is too high a cost to pay to let the whole domestic
economy suffer from high inflation just to protect exporters,""
he said. ""China cannot afford to sacrifice its internal economy
as it has a vast domestic market.""	
 China's net exports accounted for just 4 percent of the
country's total output in 2009; consumption and investment were
48 percent each.	
 
 WHERE TO PUT IT?	
 Then there is the perennial problem of finding a safe place
to invest $3 trillion. Its monstrous size precludes China from
most markets except U.S. Treasuries, leaving Beijing vulnerable
to a struggling dollar.	
 Efforts to boost China's returns on its reserves by spinning
off state investment arms misses the point, said Li.	
 ""Any fund manager in the world would find it difficult to
look after such a huge pile of reserves,"" he said.	
 ""The point is not how successful they were in their
investments. The real failure is the lack of an exchange rate
regime that is fully dictated by market forces.""	
 China's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves also
represents an opportunity cost. Given China's high savings rate
over the past decade, it was bound to have a high rate of
investment.	
 Had China let its currency rise, that investment could have
taken place at home with the building of sorely needed schools
and hospitals. Instead, much of that investment ended up parked
in assets like U.S. Treasuries.	
 China is the biggest foreign holder of Treasuries, with
$1.15 trillion at the end of January.	
 
 NOT FAST ENOUGH	
 Yet China's strident rhetoric about how the yuan is not
undervalued and how it needs to rise slowly belies a growing
belief at home that the currency is simply not strong enough. 
 Increasingly, the Chinese realise that a firmer yuan can
help them fight imported inflation and give them more bang for
buck when they invest abroad.	
 ""The government is moving too slowly towards a more flexible
yuan exchange rate. They should definitely quicken the pace o
appreciation,"" said Zhang Bin, an economist at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences. 
 Some economists say that concerns about exporters are
overdone. They, too, would benefit from cheaper imports of raw
materials and other components.	
 ""We know that the foreign exchange reserves accumulate
because of the exchange rate regime. It's not because we
absolutely need it,"" said Tao Wang, an analyst at UBS.	
 ""The fundamental thing is to adjust the economic structure
so that we don't accumulate so much. We need to consumer more
and reduce the savings rate.""	
 In a sign that China might finally be starting to move more
aggressively on the yuan -- potentially capping the rise in
reserves -- the central bank has steered the currency to a
succession of record highs against the dollar in recent days.

allocation)	
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Akiko Takeda	
 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers reduced
their global stock weighting to a 12-year low in March, while
raising their bond weighting to an all-time high as they
lightened risk positions after a devastating earthquake in
Japan, a Reuters survey showed.	
 Fund managers increased their cash position in March to the
highest level since November 2009 after the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami in northeastern Japan severely damaged Tokyo
Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.	
 Money managers also had to actively cut their risk positions
as increasing unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
bolstered global oil prices.	
 ""The massive disaster in Japan was the major factor. But
even leaving that aside, uncertainty was already building due to
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa,"" said Yoshinori
Nagano, a senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.	
 ""The market was relatively stable despite many
uncertainties. There are expectations that investment conditions
will improve potentially, but this doesn't mean that the market
can ease its caution towards taking risks.""	
 Fund managers' average weighting for global equities in
March fell 3.6 percentage points from the previous month to 42.4
percent -- the lowest since January 1999.	
 The weighting for bonds climbed to the highest since the
survey was first compiled in February 1995. It jumped to 49.6
percent in March from 47.6 percent a month earlier.	
 ""Shares prices are expected to be under selling pressure for
a while as the market is still not sure about the impact of the
nuclear problem and power shortages,"" said Yuichi Kodama, an
economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.	
 ""Stocks are likely to be supported later in the year as we
are expecting to see demand related to reconstruction in the
damaged areas, but gains are likely to be limited due to
uncertainty over potential economic growth in the country.""	
 Japanese money managers piled into more cash positions, with
exposure to cash jumping 1.0 percentage point to 5.2 percent --
the highest since November 2009. 
 Their weighting for alternative assets rose by 0.6 point to
1.5 percent in March, while the weighting for property inched up
by 0.1 point to 1.4 percent.	
 The Reuters poll was based on responses from 12 Japan-based
institutional investors, instead of the usual 13 as one company
was unable to finalise its allocation due to the earthquake.

 The poll of asset management companies was conducted March

 NEW DELHI, April 14 (Reuters) - Indian farmers are expected
to harvest a record wheat crop in 2011, higher than last year's
80.8 million tonnes, helped by good weather conditions and
raising the chance of exports.	
 The world's second-biggest wheat producer and consumer
banned exports in 2007 to bolster domestic supplies as bad
weather hit crops. 
 But India's federal government is expected to tread
cautiously and, in the best-case scenario, allow exports of no
more than 2 to 3 million tonnes -- just a fraction of the
country's estimated 2011 production of around 84 million --
because of surging domestic food prices and exploding demand.	
 For a related story, see: [ID:L3E7FC1IX]	
 
 Here is a chronology of some key events, turning points and
decisions on wheat by the government since 2006: 
 March 2006 - India abolishes 60 percent import tax on
overseas purchases of wheat by official agencies, and decides to
buy wheat after a gap of six years. The import tax for private
players is cut to 5 percent. 
 May 2006 - State-run Food Corp of India buys only 9.2
million tonnes of wheat from local farmers against a target of
16.2 million tonnes. 
 July 2006 - Government wheat stocks fall to 8.2 million
tonnes, nearly 9 million tonnes below target. 
 July 2006 - The government estimates India's 2006 wheat
production at 69.4 million tonnes against an initial estimate of
73.0 million tonnes. 
 Dec 2006 - India's wheat imports total 5.5 million tonnes in
2006. 
 Feb 2007 - India bans wheat exports. 
 Feb 2007 - India bans wheat futures trade. 
 May 2007 - Food Corp of India, which buys grain from farmers
on behalf of the government, purchased 11 million tonnes of
wheat in the season, up from 9.2 million tonnes a year earlier. 
 Dec 2007 - India imports 1.8 million tonnes of wheat. 
 Dec 2007 - India axes 36 percent import tax on wheat flour. 
 May 2008 - Food Corp of India buys 22.7 million tonnes of
wheat from domestic farmers during the season. 
 July 2008 - The government estimates 2008 harvests at 78.5
million tonnes. 
 May 2009 - Food Corp of India buys a record 25 million
tonnes of wheat from local farmers. 
 May 2009 - India allows wheat futures trade to resume. 
 July 2009 - The government sees 2009 wheat output at a
record 80.7 million tonnes. 
 July 2009 - The government lifts a ban on wheat exports, but
re-imposes the restriction within 10 days on concern food prices
may rise as the seasonal monsoon rains fail. 
 July 2009 - India allows exports of 650,000 tonnes of wheat
products until March. 
 Feb 2010 - India allows 50,000 tonnes of wheat exports to
neighbouring Nepal. 
 Feb 2010 - India produces 80.8 million tonnes of wheat in
2010.	
 March 2011 - Junior farm minister Arun Yadav said
a decision on the four-year-old ban on wheat exports could come
as early as in April.	
 April 2011 - India forecasts 2011 wheat harvest at 84.3
million tonnes, higher than the previous forecast of 81.5
million tonnes and last year's output of 80.8 million tonnes.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2011 06:08AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Some key facts about India's wheat crop," NEW DELHI, April 14 (Reuters) - India, the world's
second-biggest wheat producer and consumer after China, expects
a record harvest in 2011, raising hopes of exports for the first
time in eight years.	
 But India's federal government is expected to tread
cautiously and, in the best-case scenario, allow exports of no
more than 2 to 3 million tonnes -- just a fraction of the
country's estimated 2011 production of around 84 million --
worried by surging domestic food prices and exploding demand.
[ID:L3E7FC1IX]	
 
 Here are some key facts about India's wheat crop: 
- The country grows only one wheat crop in a year. It is sown
from October and the harvest begins in March. Wheat is grown on
about 28 million hectares, mainly in the northern states of
Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. 
- The central state of Madhya Pradesh, the western state of
Gujarat and the north-western state of Rajasthan produce
high-protein wheat. 
- India consumes about 76 million tonnes of wheat a year. The
government needs around 13 million tonnes every year for
subsidised sales to the poor.	
- Wheat is used to cook Indian unleavened bread items such as
rotis, chapatis and naans. It is a key staple in a country where
the majority spend most of their income on food.	
 - Wheat is vulnerable to climate change. Lower moisture
levels at the time of planting in October and higher
temperatures in February, when the crop is almost ready for
harvest, pose severe threats to the crop. 
 - Higher temperatures in February hit the country's wheat
output in 2005, forcing India to turn to global markets. In its
first imports in six years, India bought 5.5 million tonnes in
2006. Import orders were 1.8 million tonnes in 2007. 
 - Record prices after acute scarcity in previous years
pushed farmers to increase sowing of wheat, helping output soar
to 80.8 million tonnes in 2010. State-run Food Corp of India
bought 25.5 million tonnes of wheat from local farmers in 2010. 
 - There is a blanket ban on wheat exports but the government
had permitted millers to sell 650,000 tonnes of wheat products
until March 2011. 
- India has been allowing tiny wheat exports to some
neighbouring nations through diplomatic channels.

(Adds quotes, details)	
 By Kevin Yao and Langi Chiang	
 BEIJING, April 14 (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange
reserves soared to a record of more than $3 trillion by
end-March, while its money supply growth blew past forecasts,
threatening to aggravate the nation's inflation woes and trigger
more policy tightening.	
 Chinese banks extended 679.4 billion yuan ($104 billion) in
new local currency loans in March, while the broad M2 measure of
money supply rose 16.6 percent from a year earlier, both above
market expectations.	
 Tapping the brakes on money and lending growth has been a
crucial part of Beijing's campaign to rein in inflation, which
probably hit a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in the year to
March, according to local media reports.	
 After making progress at the start of the year in mopping up
excess cash, the People's Bank of China appeared to lose some
ground in March.	
 ""The latest numbers show that it is still too early for
China to ease monetary tightening. China still needs to keep
tightening policy at the current pace in coming months,"" said Qu
Hongbin, chief China economist with HSBC.	


 INFLATION PICKING UP	
 Looking at the first quarter as a whole, the central bank
has had some success in controlling loan issuance, said Liu
Hongke, economist with CCB International Securities in Beijing.	
 She noted that the 2.24 trillion yuan in new loans in the
first three months of the year was about 30 percent of the
government's full-year target, exactly in line with where it
wanted to be at this stage.	
 ""It shows the central bank is doing a good job,"" Liu said.
But she added that China would need to raise banks' required
reserves again very soon to absorb excess liquidity. 
 China's inflation accelerated to as fast as 5.4 percent in
March from a year earlier, Hong Kong media said on Thursday,
reinforcing the government's vow to rein in price rises.
[ID:nL3E7FE0EO] 
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected annual inflation
in March to be 5.2 percent, up from February's 4.9 percent. 
 The website of Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, citing an
unidentified source, said annual inflation in March was likely
to be 5.3-5.4 percent, a 32-month high. Official data will be
released on Friday morning.	
 China has raised benchmark interest rates four times since
last October and has required the country's big banks to lock up
a record high of 20.0 percent of their deposits as reserves.
[ID:nTOE722076]	
 Economists polled by Reuters last week said that China was
heading for a pause in its half-year cycle of monetary
tightening, forecasting that it would raise interest rates just
once more this year.	
 
 FX RESERVES SURGE	
 A measure of the difficulties faced by China in taming
inflation came in the first quarter's nearly $200 billion
increase in its foreign exchange reserves, already the world's
biggest, to $3.05 trillion.	
 The rapid reserve build-up could indicate hefty capital
inflows given that China had a $1.02 billion trade deficit in
the first quarter-- the first quarterly deficit since 2004 --
which could complicate the government's fight against inflation.	
 ""It could be a sign of strong capital inflows, which implies
that there will be room for more reserve requirement ratio hikes
and stricter credit control measures,"" said Connie Tse,
economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore.	
 Also, the dollar's broad weakening against major currencies
in recent months meant that the value of China's existing
reserves, which is expressed in dollars, was bound to increase.	
 The dollar hit a fresh 16-month low against a basket
of currencies on Thursday as expectations grew that the Federal
Reserve would keep monetary policy loose for some time.
[ID:nLDE73D0MR]	
 China's vast forex reserves are often seen as a sign of the
strength of its economy, stemming in large part from its vast
trade surplus, but the rapid growth translates into money
creation and additional inflationary pressures at home.	
 ""There have been stronger expectations of yuan appreciation
and faster hot money inflows in the first quarter,"" said Li Jie,
head of China forex reserves research centre at the Central
Universify of Finance and Economics in Beijing.

 * Vulnerable firms may fall into bankruptcy
 * Medium-size shippers warn of rate war
(Adds bullet points)	
 By Randy Fabi and Harry Suhartono	
 SINGAPORE, April 14 (Reuters) - The global container market
is poised to consolidate in the next few years as A.P. Moller
Maersk  and other major shippers roll out bigger
vessels, potentially forcing smaller rivals to drop out of an
already oversupplied market.	
 Medium-sized container firms warn that a move by the majors
to flood the market with mega ships could spark a ""rate war""
similar to 2009 when the market plummeted and most firms fell
into the red in one of the industry's worst downturns.	
 ""We believe that... the largest shipping companies will
continue to expand the scale of economies of the industry,"" said
Thomas Knudsen, Maersk Line's chief executive for Asia Pacific
Region, at an industry conference in Singapore.	
 ""As we drive these scales of economy, it will be difficult
for the smaller carriers in these industries to compete. That
will drive consolidation."" 
 
 Maersk, the world's top container shipper which holds a 15
percent share of the container market, is expanding its fleet by
around 8 percent annually to keep up with economic growth.	
 ""We are not doing this aiming at taking market share,""
Maersk Chief Executive Nils Andersen told reporters at an
industry event. He agreed that consolidation would be the most
likely outcome.	
 
 BIGGER IS BETTER	
 Industry leaders in the container markets have placed
multi-billion dollar orders for the world's biggest vessels to
meet growing demand in Europe and the United States for Chinese
manufactured goods. 
 Maersk in February ordered 10 of the world's largest
container ships for $1.9 billion and took options on 20 more
vessels of a similar size to capitalise on expected growth on
the benchmark Asia-Europe route. [ID:nL3E7DI06K]	
 Due for delivery from 2013, Maersk's 18,000 twenty-foot
equivalent unit (TEU) container vessels would surpass the
current largest box ship of 15,000 TEUs, also owned by the
company.	
 Switzerland-based Mediterranean Shipping Company and French
privately held CMA-CGM, which are the next two biggest container
shippers after Maersk, are also looking to expand their fleet
with ships above 10,000 TEUs, analysts said.	
 About 50 mega container ships with 10,000 TEU capacity or
more are expected to be delivered this year, making up nearly
half of the total new capacity of 1.35 million TEUs due for
2011, according to the leading industry consultancy group
Alphaliner. The orderbook showed 59 mega ships for 2012.	
 ""Bigger is better if you can fill the ship,"" said Randy
Chen, special assistant to the president at Taiwan-based Wan Hai
Lines .	
 ""If your ships are not full, you need to put the vessels
away for the short period of time to make sure the revenue
covers the costs.""	
 
 RATE WAR	
 But major shippers were unlikely to idle new ships, placing
the burden of plummeting freight rates on smaller rivals.	
 Spot rates on the Asia-Europe container route have tumbled
by about half in the last nine months, trading last week at
around $978 per TEU from more than $1,800 in July 2010.	
 Although the market was expected to rebound slightly in the
second half, the battle for survival has already become too
difficult for some container firms.	
 Norway-based The Containership Company has announced it will
suspend its container shipping operations on poor cargo volumes
and excessive competition, industry group Alphaliner said.	
 Others are poised to follow. 
 U.S.-based container shipper Horizon Lines warned
last month it could also be forced to seek bankruptcy protection
for not being able to comply with its debt agreements.	
 ""In container ships, a lot of companies are not making money
right now,"" said Janet Lewis, shipping analyst at Macquarie
Securities, adding that Chilean CSAV was also under
pressure.	
 Last month, Standard & Poor's cut its outlook on CSAV's
corporate credit rating to ""negative"" from ""positive"" to reflect
its view of the container shipping company's weak business risk
profile and aggressive financial risk profile. [ID:nWNA4434]
 
 VULNERABLE FIRMS	
 Vulnerable container companies are likely to be allowed to
fall into bankruptcy instead of being saved by a larger firm
through an acquisition, experts said.	
 ""I doubt if operators have any interest in taking over an
organisation. They are more interested in buying fleets, just
buying the ships and hardware,"" Harald Serck-Hanssen, head of
global shipping for DnB Nor, told Reuters.	
 Industry executives said smaller companies could turn to
shorter niche routes.	
 ""I don't fully support the notion bigger size is necessarily
better. It depends on your shipping network,"" said Eng Aik Meng,
president of APL container shipping line, a unit of Singapore's
Neptune Orient Lines .	
 ""Shipping lines are quite flexible. There are many other
trades in the world, not just Asia-Europe and transpacific, but
also Latin American and intra-Asia trades.""	
 Industry officials, however, pointed out that the smaller
players would not be easily pushed out of the market as many are
family-owned or subsidized by governments.	
 ""In a rate war, no single line can be the winner,"" said
Kenichi Kuroya, chief executive of Japan's third largest
shipping firm Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha .	
 ""What 2009 showed ... is that any rates quoted by the
leading lines can be matched by others in one week's time. The
rate war will continue until the bottom line is where no single
liner can bear.""

 SANYA, China, April 14 (Reuters) - The five BRICS nations
discussed reform of the international monetary system at a
meeting in southern China on Thursday, but steered clear of the
contentious topic of the Chinese exchange rate, a senior Chinese
official said. 
 Wu Hailong, an assistant Chinese foreign minister, said the
leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa had
also discussed the composition of the Special Drawing Right, the
International Monetary Fund's unit of account. 
 ""The yuan exchange rate was not on the agenda of this BRICS
summit meeting, but the reform of the international monetary
system is one of the key issues of the meeting,"" Wu told a news
conference.	
 Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff has faced complaints at
home from manufacturers and officials, who say China's cheap
yuan currency is undercutting domestic production and that China
is soaking up Brazil's commodities such as iron ore, but not
buying value-added products.	
 Still, the five BRICS nations took another step towards
cementing their global influence on Thursday, calling for a
broad-based international reserve currency system ""providing
stability and certainty"". [ID:nL3E7FE07J]	
 ""The five countries agreed to discuss the role of the SDR in
the current international monetary system, including the
composition of the SDR currency basket,"" Wu added.	
 And the development banks of the five BRICS nations agreed
in principle to establish mutual credit lines denominated in
their local currencies, not in dollars. [ID:nL3E7FE0AV]	
 ""Trade settlement in local currencies among the five
countries will promote trade and investment liberalisation. It
will lead to even closer business and trade ties among these
five countries,"" Wu said.	
 On the issue of whether the BRICS would expand again to
include other large, developing nations -- South Africa joined
the summit for the first time this year -- Wu said there had
been no concrete decisions.	
 ""A fair number of countries have expressed interest in
joining the BRICS. This shows that the mechanism is dynamic and
attractive. At the meeting, the leaders discussed enlargement,
and agreed that any decision will be made based on consensus of
all members of the BRICS.""	
 Wu also played down any political rifts between the existing
member states, made up of authoritarian regimes such as China
and the vibrant democracies of India and Brazil.	
 ""What's important now is to broaden consensus as much as
possible and tone down differences, and start cooperation in
fields where there is already consensus,"" he said.	
 ""For those issues where there are differences, we will put
them aside for the time being. We will not let those differences
undermine solidarity and impede cooperation among BRICS

 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, April 14 (Reuters) - Inflation risks in the euro
zone have risen, not least because of high oil prices, while
economic growth risks are balanced, ECB Executive Board member
Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said on Thursday.
 Investors are scrutinising ECB rhetoric to determine how
soon the central bank could raise interest rates again after
hiking for the first time since 2008 last week. [ID:nLDE7351QH]
Most analysts expect the next rate move by July. [ECB/INT]
 ""Risks to growth are balanced, inflation (risks are) to the
upside,"" Gonzalez-Paramo told reporters on the sidelines of the
Risk & Return Russia conference in Moscow.
 ""Oil prices are the main driver of the recent increase in
inflation. The expectation in the market is that oil will not go
down quickly,"" he added, noting that it was the ECB's job to
ensure that oil prices do not push inflation above target.
 He made no reference to the likelihood of further rate
hikes, contrasting with other ECB ratesetters who recently
signalled the bank is ready to tighten monetary policy again in
coming months. [ID:nLDE73C21S]
 ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said on Wednesday
that last week's 25 basis point rise in the refinancing rate to
1.25 percent was not a one-off.
 Mario Draghi, also of the 23-member policy setting Governing
Council, said the ECB's main rate is ""very accommodating"" even
after the hike and that it is looking at ways to withdraw its
""exceptionally expansionary"" monetary stance.
 For his part, Gonzalez-Paramo simply reiterated the ECB's
line that they ""never pre-commit on interest rates"".
 ""We will monitor in real time what the developments in
inflation and in particular in inflation expectations,"" he told
the conference when asked whether the ECB would hike again soon.
 He said the ECB's non-standard stimulus measures, introduced
during the crisis, were independent of its traditional monetary
policy steps, and thus were not an impediment to interest rate
hikes.
 Gonzalez-Paramo also said that Greece should be able to
return to the markets for funding by early next year as planned
if it follows the terms of its European Union and International
Monetary Fund bailout programme.
 ""The implementation of the programme is key to the return to
the market,"" he said, adding that so far the assessment of
Greece's progress on the programme was ""positive"".
 Some officials have voiced concern that about the size of
the Greek debt burden, and raised the prospect of a possible
need for a restructuring. [ID:nLDE73C28V]

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - European stocks sank,
peripheral debt yields soared and the euro fell on Thursday as
concern that Greece will have to restructure its debt gathered
pace while Chinese inflation returned as an investment concern.
 Wall Street looked set to open lower, with the spotlight on
the possible impact of rising raw material costs on corporate
margins.
 World stocks were 0.4 percent lower despite a burst of
corporate activity that would usually lift investors' spirits.
 Glencore, the world's largest commodities trading company,
plans to raise up to $12.1 billion in a London and Hong Kong
stock market flotation that is London's biggest ever. Shares in
Japan's Isuzu Motors jumped on a report that Volkswagen was
considering buying all or part of it.
 European shares, as measured by the FTSEurofirst 300, were
down three quarters of a percent, only around half a percent
higher than at the end of last year.
 Greek bond yields soared, with short-dated paper coming
under the most intense pressure, as markets priced in a greater
probability that Athens would be forced to restructure its
runaway debt.
 Yields of other peripheral euro zone states also rose
sharply.
 European stocks were also pressured, however, by concern
that Chinese inflation is returning.
 Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, citing an unnamed source, said
China's annual rate of inflation in March was likely to be
5.3-5.4 percent, a 32-month high and just above an estimate in a
Reuters poll.
 Investors are particularly concerned about Chinese inflation
in case government attempts to restrain it prompt a 'hard
landing' for the economy.
 ""Inflation in emerging economies has become a serious issue,
as the impact from high commodity prices is stronger for those
countries,"" said Arnaud Scarpaci, fund manager at Paris-based
Agilis Gestion.
 Earlier, the Nikkei benchmark closed up 0.1 percent, held
back by continued worries about the impact of its earthquake,
tsunami and nuclear disasters.
 The Reuters Tankan survey of 400 large firms found on
Thursday that power shortages caused by the crippled Fukushima
nuclear plant had hit nearly 60 percent of local companies,
disrupting production and supply chains.
 
 EURO HIT
 The euro slipped broadly, hitting a session low versus the
dollar on debt restructuring worries.
 It fell to the day's trough around $1.4376. Earlier in the
day it had hit a session high around $1.4515 but came under
additional selling pressure after a break under $1.4450
triggered stop-loss orders.
 The euro struggled across the board, falling roughly 1.2
percent on the day against the yen to 121.03 yen according to
Reuters data.
 Earlier, the dollar hit a 16-month low against a basket of
major currencies, but pared back the losses.

 By Kevin Yao and Langi Chiang	
 BEIJING, April 14 (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange
reserves soared to a record at more than $3 trillion at the end
of the first quarter, and its money growth blew past forecasts
in March, threatening to aggravate the nation's inflation woes.	
 Chinese banks extended 679.4 billion yuan ($104.0 billion)
in new local currency loans in March, while the broad M2 measure
of money supply rose 16.6 percent from a year ago, both above
market expectations.	
 Tapping the brakes on money and lending growth has been a
crucial part of Beijing's campaign to rein in inflation, which
probably hit a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in the year to
March, according to local media reports.	
 After making progress at the start of the year in mopping up
excess cash, the People's Bank of China appeared to lose some
ground in March.	
 ""The latest numbers show that it is still too early for
China to ease monetary tightening. China still needs to keep
tightening policy at the current pace in coming months,"" said Qu
Hongbin, chief China economist with HSBC.	
 A measure of the difficulties faced by China in taming
inflation came in the first quarter's nearly $200 billion
increase in its foreign exchange reserves, already the world's
biggest, to $3.05 trillion.	
 Although China's vast reserves are often seen as a sign of
the strength of its economy, the growing pile, stemming in large
part from its vast trade surplus, translates into money creation
and inflationary pressure at home.	
 China has raised benchmark interest rates four times since
last October and has required the country's big banks to lock up
a record high of 20.0 percent of their deposits as reserves.
[ID:nTOE722076]	
 Economists polled by Reuters last week said that China was
heading for a pause in its half-year cycle of monetary
tightening, forecasting that it would raise interest rates just
once more this year.	
 Looking at the first quarter as a whole, the central bank
was grasping the nettle in controlling loan issuance, said Liu
Hongke, economist with CCB International Securities in Beijing.	
 She noted that the 2.24 trillion yuan in new loans in the
first three months of the year was about 30 percent of the
government's full-year target, exactly in line with where it
wanted to be at this stage.	
 ""It shows the central bank is doing a good job,"" Liu said.
But she added that China would need to raise banks' required
reserves again very soon to absorb excess liquidity.

250,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2011 03:52AM ET</span>",Forex - Broadly weaker dollar slips to 2-week low against yen,
251,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2011 03:48AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Hong Kong market regulator says RMB hype ahead of reality," HONG KONG, April 14 (Reuters) - The hype surrounding
yuan-denominated investment products in Hong Kong is getting
ahead of itself, the city's market regulator said on Thursday.	
 Banks in Hong Kong are flush with renminbi deposits as
investors bet on the Chinese currency appreciating significantly
in coming years. But with bank deposits yielding just 0.4
percent to 0.6 percent, investors are clamouring for new
yuan-denominated products which can offer higher returns. 
 The first yuan-denominated real estate investment trust IPO,
Hui Xian, is due to launch at the end of April and has already
been fully covered by investors despite it offering a lower
dividend yield than most Hong Kong listed trusts. 
 ""I think the excitement of RMB products has probably got
ahead of the reality,"" Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the
Securities and Futures Commission, told Reuters in an interview
in Hong Kong. 
 He added that while there is a lot of renminbi in Hong
Kong's banking system, that doesn't necessarily mean the city
has the capacity for a rush of new products. 
 ""In truth there is a significant build-up of renminbi
deposits but that doesn't necessarily translate into adequate
liquidity to launch products into,"" he added. 
 The level of yuan denominated deposits held in Hong Kong now
stands at the equivalent of $62.3 billion, more than four times
higher than last June. 
 On the broader issue of financial reform, Wheatley, who is
leaving the SFC this summer to take up a new post at the UK's
Financial Services Authority, dismissed suggestions that
differences in laws between countries is creating loopholes for
so-called ""regulatory arbitrage"", where companies may move to
areas with less onerous rules and restrictions.	
 ""At the headline level we've got absolute unanimity across
different countries, on a technical level there will be some
differences but the commitment is to resolve them so markets
can't use them to escape regulation,"" he said. 
 But he did note that the sort of complex financial products
widely blamed for their part in causing the global financial
crisis are starting to re-emerge. 
 ""I think we're already seeing a reappearance in truth,"" he
said.	
 ""Banks are innovative by their nature, they're there to
generate shareholder returns, they will innovate and they will
create new products - the job of the regulator is to evaluate
those products as they come along and decide whether or not
they're good for the market.""

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, April 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks reversed losses on
Thursday after Hong Kong media reported upbeat Chinese economic
data a day ahead of the official release, and surprisingly
strong growth figures from Singapore underscored investor
confidence in the region.	
 Gold edged closer to a record high of $1.476.21 as
the U.S. dollar fell to fresh 16-month lows versus a basket of
major currencies, while U.S. crude  firmed to $107.45 a
barrel, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. gasoline stocks.	
 Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, citing an unnamed source, reported
higher-than-expected increases in Chinese retail sales and
industrial output, but also said inflation in the world's second
biggest economy had accelerated. [ID:nL3E7FE0EO]	
 Singapore impressed after reporting its economy grew 23.5
percent in the first quarter on an seasonally-adjusted
annualised basis, blowing past even the most bullish forecast in
a Reuters poll. 
 Singapore's central bank also allowed an immediate rise in
the value of its currency to help tackle inflation, which it
said would likely stay elevated.	
 The Singapore dollar -- the world's 12th most
actively traded currency -- rose to an all-time high of S$1.2477
per U.S. dollar before slipping back slightly.	
 
 The upbeat data helped Asian stocks regain ground with
Japan's Nikkei ending 0.1 percent higher, having earlier
fallen as much as 0.9 percent. Stocks elsewhere in Asia
put on 0.08 percent, keeping in sight a
three-year peak set on Monday.	
 U.S. stock index futures  traded modestly
higher, suggesting a positive start for Wall Street.	
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index was one of the weakest
performers in the region, closing down 0.6 percent, led by a 12
percent plunge in contractor Leighton Holdings , which
flagged a big year loss.	
 ""We've had a fantastic run in the previous three weeks.
We're easing back a bit now and that's probably the way we'll
glide into Easter,"" said Austock Securities senior client
adviser, Michael Heffernan.	
 
 U.S. DOLLAR STRUGGLES	
 By allowing its currency to rise, Singapore could encourage
other Asian central banks to let their currencies appreciate
further to contain imported inflation.	
 ""The monetary policy is a little more aggressive than we
expected, so I think it's a realisation that inflation is going
to be a bigger problem in the months ahead,"" said Wai Ho Leong,
economist at Barclays Capital.	
 ""The recent crisis in Japan is probably adding to inflation
pressure, rather than subtracting from growth in the near term.""	
 Still, last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami in
Japan's northeast saw Japanese corporate confidence plunge by a
record amount in April, a Reuters survey showed. 
 The U.S. dollar, already under pressure, slipped further in
the wake of Singapore's action. 
 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in remarks published by the
official Xinhua news agency on Thursday, said China should make
its currency more flexible to help rein in price rises. 
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, plumbed a fresh 16-month
trough of 74.642.	
 There was little market reaction to U.S. President Barack
Obama's freshly announced goal of cutting the U.S. budget
deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years through spending cuts and
tax increases on the rich.	
 ""The move to fiscal discipline is not likely to weigh
materially on growth in 2011,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a
client note, adding it was unlikely to hit 2012 hard as well
given it is an election year.	
 ""But efforts to address the longer-term fiscal picture would
indeed be encouraging.""

 * Greenback below 200-day MA vs yen
 * MAS tightening weighs on dollar; Fed to stay put on QE2

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, April 14 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a fresh 16-month
low against a basket of currencies on Thursday as expectations
grew the Federal Reserve would keep its loose monetary policy,
widening interest rate differentials in favour of
higher-yielding currencies.	
 In flow-driven trading, the dollar briefly broke below its
200-day moving average near 83.43 yen after investors lightened
sizeable long positions established after the U.S. currency's
speedy ascent from its record low of 76.25 in March.	
 The tone for the dollar remained weak after Wednesday's U.S.
retail sales data and the Fed's Beige Book report did nothing to
change the view the central bank would keep its $600 billion
asset buying programme until June.	
 In contrast, the European Central Bank is expected to follow
up its April interest rate hike with more tightening later this
year, a factor keeping the single currency near a 15-month peak
against the dollar.	
 ""It's driven by position adjustment as the move has been too
fast. The dollar's quick rise of almost 10 yen has left sizeable
longs,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citibank.	
 ""The rise in U.S. yields has stopped and the focus is moving
to when the Fed will actually raise interest rates after it ends
its QE2 policy in June. But it can't raise rates straight after
June. Until the market starts to seriously price in a U.S. rate
hike, the euro will stay supported.""	
 The dollar index , which measures its strength
against major currencies, fell to 74.676, bringing its losses
this year to around 5 percent.	
 The dollar fell as low as 83.20 yen on EBS, moving
away from its 6-1/2 month high around 85.55 set last week.	
 Market players say Japanese exporters will soon resume their
dollar sales which they had postponed after the March 11
earthquake as production recovers.	
 The area around 85.40/85.95 represents a 50 percent
retracement of the decline from its May peak, the September
highs and a critical downtrend-line from the 2007 cycle high.	
 The euro rose half a percent to $1.4508 , approaching
its 15-month high of $1.4521. Sterling and the Australian dollar
also rose against the U.S. currency.	
 ""The fact that the U.S. recovery is continuing will not
become a trigger point for Fed policy,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 ""Unemployment, although improving, is still relatively high
and the Fed is not going to bring forward the end of its loose
monetary policy. The dollar is finding no fresh factors to rise
on.""	
 Mizuho Corporate Bank said that $1.4500 represented pivotal
resistance, adding the Deutschmark never managed to hold above
its equivalent to this level since exchange rates were floated.	
 The euro hit a session low of 120.18 yen before
moving back to 121.28, still off its 11-month high around 123.30
set this week.	
 Singapore's stronger-than-expected growth data and the
central bank's move to let its currency rise against the dollar
in monetary tightening reflected strong inflationary pressures
in booming emerging economies, a factor that could weigh on the
U.S. currency. [ID:nSFK000031]	
 China's central bank also let the yuan climb to a fresh
trading peak to fight imported inflation [ID:nL3E7FE0BH]. Hong
Kong's Phoenix TV cited an unnamed source as saying China's
annual inflation accelerated to 5.3-5.4 percent in March
[ID:nB9E7EN026].	
 Goldman Sachs said its models suggested the dollar is now
about 13 percent cheaper than its fair value on a trade-weighted
basis. However, only four out of 32 currencies of U.S. trading

 * Global economic prospects shrouded in uncertainty
(Updates with fresh comments)	
 By Abhijit Neogy and Alexei Anishchuk	
 SANYA, China, April 14 (Reuters) - The BRICS group of
emerging-market powers kept up the pressure on Thursday for a
revamped global monetary system that relies less on the dollar
and for a louder voice in international financial institutions.	
 The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
also called for stronger regulation of commodity derivatives to
dampen excessive volatility in food and energy prices, which
they said posed new risks for the recovery of the world economy.	
 Meeting on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, they said
the recent financial crisis had exposed the inadequacies of the
current monetary order, which has the dollar as its linchpin.	
 What was needed, they said in a statement, was ""a
broad-based international reserve currency system providing
stability and certainty"" -- thinly veiled criticism of what the
BRICS see as Washington's neglect of its global monetary
responsibilities.	
 The BRICS are worried that America's large trade and budget
deficits will eventually debase the dollar. They also begrudge
the financial and political privileges that come with being the
leading reserve currency.	
 ""The world economy is undergoing profound and complex
changes,"" Chinese President Hu Jintao said. ""The era demands
that the BRICS countries strengthen dialogue and cooperation.""	
 


 
 In another dig at the dollar, the development banks of the
five BRICS nations agreed to establish mutual credit lines
denominated in their local currencies, not the U.S. currency.
[ID:nL3E7FE0AV]	
 The head of China Development Bank (CDB), Chen Yuan, said he
was prepared to lend up to 10 billion yuan to fellow BRICS, and
his Russian counterpart said he was looking to borrow the yuan
equivalent of at least $500 million via CDB.	
 ""We think this will undoubtedly broaden the opportunities
for Russian companies to diversify their loans,"" Vladimir
Dmitriev, the chairman of VEB, Russia's state development bank,
told reporters. [ID:nL3E7FE0VY]

 ALL DOWN TO THE BRICS	
 The call by the BRICS for a new monetary order are not new.	
 But, coming hours before a meeting in Washington of finance
ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations, the
traditional power brokers of the world economy, Thursday's
communique showed the growing confidence of emerging markets.	
 Burdened by heavy debt, the United States, the euro zone and
Japan are struggling to shake off the lingering effects of the
2008 global financial crisis. Rich countries will grow 2.4
percent this year and 2.6 percent in 2012, the International
Monetary fund forecast this week. [ID:nWAL8FE75J]	
 By contrast, less well-off countries have emerged relatively
unscathed. The IMF is forecasting that emerging and developing
countries will grow 6.5 percent both this year and next.	
 ""The quality and the durability of the global economic
recovery process depends to a great measure on how the BRICS
economies perform,"" Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said.	
 The leaders reviewed the global role of the Special Drawing
Right, the IMF's accounting unit and reserve asset, which some
experts believe could grow into a partial substitute for the
dollar.	
 But they stepped around the issue of whether the yuan should
join the SDR, saying only that they welcomed discussion of the
composition of the SDR's basket of currencies.	
 A member-country official said the group was split on
whether China's currency, which cannot be freely exchanged
except for trade and investment purposes, met the criteria for
being part of the SDR.	
 ""There is a need for a broad-basing of the international
monetary system. The SDR is an instrument to do that, but we
still have no unanimity on the inclusion of the Chinese currency
in the SDR as of now,"" said the official, who declined to be
identified.	
 The SDR now comprises the dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen
and the British pound.	
 ""India has said that the SDR is an accounting mechanism used
by the IMF, and countries such as Brazil have also said that
this (the yuan) should be convertible first,"" he added.	
 Though keen on a more diverse global monetary order, Beijing
has given no indication that it is ready to make the yuan freely
tradable or to dismantle capital controls as the price for the
prestige of being part of the SDR.	
 
 BROAD-BRUSH TREATMENT	
 Emerging economies have already won more say in the way the
IMF is run, but the BRICS leaders said they were still
under-represented.	
 ""We ... agreed on the need for the reform of international
financial institutions in order to promote a just economic
order,"" South African President Jacob Zuma said.	
 On the hot topic of capital flows, the BRICS called ""for
more attention"" to the risks posed by massive cross-border flows
of money but went no further.	
 The group said the world economy, of which its members make
up nearly a fifth, still faced headwinds.	
 ""The developments in west Asia and north Africa, and the
aftermath of the huge tragedy that befell Japan, have introduced
fresh uncertainties in the global recovery process,"" Singh said.	
 Swings in commodity prices are also a prime area of concern
for the BRICS. China is the world's biggest importer of many
commodities; the other BRICS members are major exporters of
natural resources. 
 China hopes the group will be able to agree on a common
stance on commodity price fluctuations at the G20 summit in the
French city of Cannes in November. [ID:nL3E7F2041] 
 The main aim of the BRICS is to forge a common
emerging-market negotiating stance on issues from climate change
to world trade and to act as a counterweight to the West in
settings such as the Group of 20 forum of advanced and
developing economies.	
 The BRICS caucus is a work in progress. Thursday's brief
meeting, held under tight security at a beach-front hotel, was
only its third summit and the first to include South Africa.	
 The group brings together five countries that, though
frequently united in their disinclination to do the West's

development prospects as an alliance are exceptional,"" Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev said.

 Economists polled by Reuters had expected annual inflation
in March to be 5.2 percent, up from February's 4.9 percent.	
 The website of Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, citing an unnamed

 By Kevin Lim	
 SINGAPORE, April 14 (Reuters) - Singapore tightened monetary
policy on Thursday as it reported a stellar first quarter for
the economy, another sign of strength in a region that is
driving global growth while also stepping up the fight against
inflation.	
 The Singapore dollar shot to a record high after the
Southeast Asian city-state reported growth of 8.5 percent
year-on-year in the first three months of 2011, far above the
forecasts of 10 economists polled by Reuters. [ID:nL3E7F70EQ]	
 On a seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter annualised
basis, the economy grew a breakneck 23.5 percent, the fastest
pace since April-June 2010, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and
Industry said.	
 ""GDP growth was stronger than our expectations, largely
because of stronger manufacturing growth of 13.9 percent,
against January-February growth of 7.7 percent,"" said Bank of
America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin.	
 ""This suggests manufacturing surged in March, despite
Japan's earthquake,"" he added.	
 The MAS said tighter policy would continue to restrain
prices, but added that inflation this year will likely remain
elevated and come in at the upper half of its 3-4 percent
forecast range. 
 
 Singapore's speedy growth should be a bellwether for other
emerging economies in the region and comes on the back of strong
economic data from China.	
 China said on Thursday that March power consumption rose
13.4 percent from a year ago, while first quarter trade numbers
out recently showed a sharp jump in exports and imports by the
world's second-largest economy. [ID:nL3E7FE054] [ID:nL3E7FA00N]	
 In stark contrast, Japanese corporate confidence plunged by
a record in April and is seen worsening further after last
month's earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan's northeast and
triggered a nuclear crisis, a Reuters poll showed.
[ID:nL3E7FD3IS]	
 ""Business sentiment deteriorated sharply as expected, as
manufacturing activities in not only the quake-hit region but
other areas completely stopped after the quake,"" said Tatsushi
Shikano, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities.	
""Although some production has resumed, the level of capacity
utilisation remains low, suggesting companies will remain
pessimistic for some time.""	
 The resilience of Asia outside Japan should also help offset
any drag from the United States, where recent disappointing data
has seen forecasts for first-quarter growth nudged lower. 
 
 TIGHTENS POLICY	
 Singapore modestly tightened monetary policy by sanctioning
an immediate rise in the value of its dollar to record highs,
becoming just the latest Asian nation to use currency strength
to fight commodity-driven inflation.	
 The Singapore dollar -- the world's 12th most
actively traded currency -- rose to an all-time high of S$1.2452
against the U.S. dollar on the news. It was trading around
S$1.2555 before the central bank released its half-year monetary
policy statement.	
 The authority re-centered its exchange rate policy band
upwards, although to below the prevailing nominal effective
exchange rate. It also left the slope and width of the band
unchanged. 
 ""They have raised the inflation forecast for this year, so
the tweaking of monetary policy is appropriate, given that it
looks that the economy may perform better than expected and
therefore exert stronger pressure on the inflation front,"" said
Song Seng Wun, a senior economist at CIMB.	
 The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) conducts policy by
managing the value of the local dollar against a basket of other
currencies, which it deems as more effective than setting
interest rates given the city-state's high level of imports. 
 The Singapore dollar had already gained close to 2 percent
against the dollar so far this year prior to Thursday's policy
statement, hitting a series of record highs as MAS and many
other Asian central banks allow their currencies to appreciate
to contain imported inflation.	
 Singapore's annual inflation spiked up to 5.5 percent in
January, far higher than analysts' expectations, but moderated
somewhat to 5.0 percent in February.	
 MAS's policy surprised some economists who had expected a
re-centering at the currency's current level, which would have
been more aggressive. Yet analysts still expected further gains
in the local dollar from here.	
 ""At this juncture, we will still be keeping our year-end
dollar-sing forecast at 1.22,"" said Emmanuel Ng, fx strategist
at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.	
 MAS said its policy adjustment took into account the tighter
policy stance adopted in April and October last year, which will
continue to have a restraining effect on the economy and prices.

 Nine of 12 economists polled by Reuters before the meeting
had predicted Singapore would tighten policy in some way at the
review. [ID:nL3E7F11KT]	
 Asia's central banks are grappling with rising inflation
even as high oil prices threaten to slow global economic growth.	
 South Korea's central bank revised its 2011 inflation
forecast upward on Wednesday, a day after keeping interest rates
steady, while Indonesia on Tuesday said it was letting the
rupiah rise as part of efforts to contain inflationary
pressures. [ID:nL3E7FC36I][ID:nL3E7FC14S]	
 Market watchers were divided on whether Singapore will
tighten policy further in October but most said other Asian
countries will likely have to raise interest rates further in
coming months.	
 ""MAS and Malaysia's central bank were early starters when it
came to tightening monetary policy in 2010. Most other Asian
central banks started later, and they still have got more work
to do throughout 2011,"" said Endre Pedersen, managing director
for Asia fixed income at Manulife Asset Management in Hong Kong.

more flexible to help rein in price rises driven by imported
inflation, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said in remarks published

 Wen's comments appeared to reinforce market expectations
that the government will let the currency play a bigger role in
curbing inflation. The yuan hit a record high of
6.531 to the dollar on Thursday, the latest in a series of
records as the central bank ramps up the pace of appreciation.	
 ""We will further improve the renminbi (yuan) exchange rate
formation mechanism, increase the flexibility of the renminbi

stabilise prices and wrestle inflation under control, Xinhua
said on Wednesday. [ID:nL3E7FD1LJ]	
 Wen was quoted by state media as saying on Sunday that the
government would use all possible measures, including the yuan
, to fight inflation -- the first time that a top
Chinese leader had publicly acknowledged that the yuan was one
of the tools for combating inflation. [ID:nL3E7FA02W]	
 The central bank has allowed the yuan to rise 4.5 percent
since it was depegged from the dollar in June 2010, and nearly
0.9 percent so far this year. [ID:nL3E7FD19I]	
 Sustained capital inflows and large amounts of maturing
bills and repos issued by the central bank in the past could
fuel market liquidity in the second quarter, Wen said.	
 ""Imported inflationary pressures and inflation expectations
are still strong,"" he said.	
 ""Global commodity prices continue to climb due to ample
global liquidity, a weaker U.S. dollar and the Middle East
turbulence as well as Japan's earthquake,"" Wen said.	
 The economy is heading in the desired direction in response
to the government's tightening measures, but inflation risks
remain elevated, partly because of soaring global oil and
commodity prices, Wen said.	
 The government must make careful estimates of the lagging
effect of monetary policies and expend more effort to avoid the
negative impact of overlapping policy effects on the economy, he
said.	
 Wen said China's trade deficit of $1.02 billion in the first
quarter -- the first quarterly deficit since 2004 -- was mainly
caused by rising import costs on global commodity price surges.	
 ""Of course, the decline in the trade surplus, caused by the
worsening of trade conditions, is not something we hope to see,""
Wen said.

 * Dollar below 200-day MA vs yen
 * MAS tightening weighs on dollar; Fed to stay put on QE2

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, April 14 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Thursday
as declines in Tokyo and other Asian shares prompted cutting of
stretched bets against the Japanese currency while the dollar
index held near a 16-month low on expectations the Federal
Reserve would keep its loose monetary policy.	
 In flow-driven trading, the dollar briefly broke below its
200-day moving average near 83.43 yen after investors lightened
sizeable long positions established after the U.S. currency's
speedy ascent from its record low of 76.25 in March.	
 The tone for dollar remained weak after Wednesday's U.S.
retail sales data and Federal Reserve report did nothing to
change the view the central bank would keep its $600 billion
asset buying programme until June.	
 ""It's driven by position adjustment as the move has been too
fast. The dollar's quick rise of almost 10 yen has left sizeable
longs,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citibank.	
 ""The rise in U.S. yields has stopped and the focus is moving
to when the Fed would actually raise interest rates after it
ends its QE2 policy in June. But it can't raise rates straight
after June.""	
 The dollar fell as low as 83.25 yen , moving further
away from its 6-1/2 month high around 85.55 set last week.	
 Market players say as more Japanese exporters get production
lines up and running again, more will resume their dollar sales,
which many had put on hold after the March 11 earthquake.	
 The area around 85.40/85.95 represents a 50 percent
retracement of the decline from its May peak, the September
highs and a critical downtrend-line from the 2007 cycle high.	
 The euro hit a session low of 120.18 yen , also off
its 11-month high around 123.30 set this week.	
 Tokyo and other Asian equities
fell around half a percent on the day, souring
risk sentiment and supporting the yen.	
 The euro was trading at $1.4431 , below its 15-month
high of $1.4521. Mizuho Corporate Bank said the euro is testing
a long-term channel resistance just ahead of pivotal resistance
at $1.4500. It said the Deutschmark never managed to hold above
its equivalent to this level since exchange rates were floated.	
 
 DOLLAR UNDER PRESSURE	
 The dollar index, which measures its strength against major
currencies, was trading at 74.961 , just above its
16-month low of 74.704 set on Wednesday. The index has lost
around 5 percent since January.	
 ""U.S. data overall was reasonable but the (Fed report)
suggested uncertainty is rising. They did not offer big clues.
The fact that the U.S. recovery is continuing will not become a
trigger point for Fed policy,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 ""Unemployment, although improving, is still relatively high
and the Fed is not going to bring forward the end of its loose
monetary policy. The dollar is finding no fresh factors to rise
on.""	
 Stronger-than-expected growth data from Singapore and the
central bank's move to let its currency rise against the dollar
in monetary tightening reflected strong inflationary pressures
in booming emerging economies, a factor that could weigh on the
U.S. currency [ID:nSFK000031].	
 Goldman Sachs said its models suggested the dollar is now
about 13 percent cheaper than its fair value on a trade-weighted
basis. However, only four out of 32 currencies of U.S. trading
partners weakened against the dollar this year, which Goldman
said would offer comfort to policymakers.

 * ""Highly likely"" suppression chamber has hole, nuclear body
says
(Adds nuclear body on leak)	
 By Linda Sieg and Mayumi Negishi	
 TOKYO, April 14 (Reuters) - Japan's fragile post-disaster
political truce unravelled on Thursday as the head of the main
opposition party called on unpopular Prime Minister Naoto Kan to
quit over his handling of the country's natural calamities and a
nuclear crisis.	
 At the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant in the northeast of
the country, engineers were struggling to find a new way to cool
one of the six crippled reactors and Japan's Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency said it was now ""highly likely"" there
was a hole in the suppression unit of the reactor.	
 Kan, whose public support stands at about 30 percent, had
sought a grand coalition to help the country recover from its
worst ever natural disaster and enact bills to pay for the
country's biggest reconstruction project since World War Two.	
 Kan's Democratic Party controls parliament's lower house but
needs opposition help to pass bills because it lacks a majority
in the upper chamber, which can block legislation.	
 But the head of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) -- who last week ruled out joining hands -- on Thursday
pressured Kan to go.	
 ""The time has come for (the prime minister) to decide
whether he stays or goes,"" Kyodo news agency quoted Sadakazu
Tanigaki as telling a news conference.	


 Tanigaki's comment reflects the view of many in his
conservative party that Kan must step down as a precondition for
any coalition as well as a hope that criticism of Kan within his
own Democratic Party will gather steam after party powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa blasted the premier over his crisis management.	
 Upper House speaker Takeo Nishioka, a well-known Kan critic
from the Democrats, also urged Kan to resign, Kyodo said.	
 Kan, however, who took office as Japan's fifth leader since
2006 last June, is not likely to step down easily, while
opposition parties could come under fire if they try to take
disaster budgets hostage in a political battle, analysts said.	
 ""Kan will probably ignore this,"" said Koichi Nakano, a
Sophia University professor. ""If they thought of the national
interests, would they (Kan's critics) do this now?""	
 
 STILL NO CLOSER TO SOLVING NUCLEAR CRISIS	
 Five weeks ago a massive earthquake and tsunami left nearly
28,000 dead or missing, devastated a broad swathe of northeast
Japan and damaged the Fukushima nuclear plant. There has been no
sign of a resolution of the atomic crisis.	
 The nuclear safety agency said a new plan for cooling one of
six reactors at the plant, 240 km (150 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, may be needed due to the large volume of highly
radioactive water on site, and tests would be done to determine
if damaged spent fuel rods were emitting radiation.	
 ""It may be difficult to completely remove the contaminated
water and so allow work to proceed (in restoring power to the
cooling pumps). We may need to think of other options,"" said
Hidehiko Nishiyama, a deputy director-general of Japan's Nuclear
Industry and Safety Authority (NISA).	
 Nishiyama said there was 20,000 tonnes of contaminated water
in the basement and a tunnel under reactor No. 2. 
 ""What makes the No.2 unit decisively different from No.1 and
No.3 units are that it is highly likely that there is a hole on
the (No.2 unit's) suppression chamber after as an explosion was
heard. It would be an accurate speculation that there is
leakage."" 
 Engineers are also concerned that some spent fuel rods were
damaged by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and could be
emitting high levels of radiation.	
 Japan's nuclear crisis has been rated on par with the
world's worst nuclear crisis at Chernobyl in 1986, although the
total amount of radiation released is only a fraction of that
when the nuclear plant in Ukraine exploded.	
 Japan has expanded a 20-km (12-mile) evacuation zone around
the plant because of high accumulated radiation. No
radiation-linked deaths have been reported and only 21 plant
workers have been affected by minor radiation sickness.	
 A series of strong aftershocks this week has rattled eastern
Japan, slowing the recovery effort at the plant due to temporary
evacuations of workers and power outages.	
 The total cost of the damage has been estimated at $300
billion, making it the world's most costly natural disaster.	
 Business confidence plunged to a record low in April,
according to a Reuters survey, and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has warned the risk to the world's third largest
economy is firmly on the downside. [ID:nLME7DP00Q]	
 The IMF cut Japan's economic growth forecast to 1.4 percent
this year from 1.6 percent, projected three months ago, and the
Bank of Japan is expected to cut its January growth forecast of
1.6 percent when it issues its twice-yearly outlook on April 28.

 * Asian shares off lows; oil edges up
 * U.S. dollar shaky after recent fall

 SYDNEY, April 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped on
Thursday as the market consolidated after a recent run-up to
near three-year highs, although Singapore's impressive growth
data underscored investor confidence in the region.	
 U.S. crude  firmed slightly to $107.33 a barrel after
data showed U.S. gasoline stockpiles plunged last week, and gold
rose towards $1,460 an ounce as the U.S. dollar held near
a 16-month low against a basket of major currencies.	
 In the first quarter, Singapore's gross domestic product
grew 23.5 percent quarter-on-quarter on an seasonally-adjusted
annualised basis, blowing past even the most bullish forecast in
a Reuters poll. 
 Singapore's central bank allowed an immediate rise in the
value of its currency dollar to help tackle inflation, which it
said would likely stay elevated.	
The Singapore dollar -- the world's 12th most actively
traded currency -- rose to an all-time high of S$1.2452 per U.S.
dollar before slipping back closer to S$1.25.	
 
 The upbeat Singapore growth news helped temper losses in
Asian stocks. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.6 percent, having
earlier lost as much as 0.9 percent, while stocks elsewhere in
Asia shed 0.3 percent.	
 Just on Monday, MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks,
excluding Japan, hit near three-year highs.	
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index was among the biggest
losers, falling 0.7 percent on the day, led by a 12.5 percent
plunge in contractor Leighton Holdings , which flagged a
big year loss.	
 ""We've had a fantastic run in the previous three weeks.
We're easing back a bit now and that's probably the way we'll
glide into Easter,"" said Austock Securities senior client
adviser, Michael Heffernan.	
 
 U.S. DOLLAR STRUGGLES	
 By allowing its currency to rise, Singapore could encourage
other Asian central banks to let their currencies appreciate
further to contain imported inflation.	
 ""The monetary policy is a little more aggressive than we
expected, so I think it's a realisation that inflation is going
to be a bigger problem in the months ahead,"" said Wai Ho Leong,
economist at Barclays Capital.	
 ""The recent crisis in Japan is probably adding to inflation
pressure, rather than subtracting from growth in the near term.""	
 Still, last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami in
Japan's northeast saw Japanese corporate confidence plunge by a
record amount in April, a Reuters survey showed. 
 The U.S. dollar, already under pressure, slipped further in
the wake of Singapore's action. 
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, plumbed a session low at
74.891, nearing a 16-month trough of 74.704 set on Tuesday.	
 A mixed bag U.S. data, including a small rise in retail
sales, did nothing to change the view that the Federal Reserve
would stick to its super-easy monetary policy, which is a
negative factor for dollar bulls. 
 Wall Street ended a choppy session little changed, although
an upbeat outlook from network equipment maker Riverbed
Technology inc helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq
close 0.6 percent higher.	
 There was little market reaction to U.S. President Barack
Obama's freshly announced goal of cutting the U.S. budget
deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years through spending cuts and
tax increases on the rich.	
 ""The move to fiscal discipline is not likely to weigh
materially on growth in 2011,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a
client note, adding it was unlikely to hit 2012 hard as well
given it is an election year.	
 ""But efforts to address the longer-term fiscal picture would
indeed be encouraging.""

 * U.S. data supports expectations Fed to stay put on QE2

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, April 13 (Reuters) - The dollar held near the
previous day's 16-month low against a basket of currencies on
Thursday as mixed U.S. data did nothing to change the view that
the Federal Reserve would stick to its super-easy monetary
policy.	
 Wednesday's data showed U.S. retail sales posted their
smallest gain in nine months in March, while a Federal Reserve
report said the economy was improving but firms are feeling the
effects of higher energy prices.[ID:nN13249074][ID:nN13282942]	
 This did nothing to change the view that the central bank
would keep its $600 billion asset buying programme until June,
especially after President Barack Obama set out targets to cut
the U.S. deficit through spending cuts and tax
increases.[ID:nN12216395]	
 The dollar has been under pressure as expectations the
European Central Bank will follow up its April interest rate
hike with more tightening are widening rate differentials in
favour of the euro, with rising oil prices boosting speculation
oil producers will diversify reserves out of dollars.	
 ""U.S. data overall was reasonable but the (Fed report)
suggested uncertainty is rising. They did not offer big clues.
The fact that the U.S. recovery is continuing will not become a
trigger point for the Fed's policy,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 ""Unemployment, although improving, is still relatively high
and the Fed is not going to bring forward the end of its loose
monetary policy. The dollar is finding no fresh factors to rise
on.""	
 The euro was trading at $1.4442 , below its 15-month
high of $1.4521. Mizuho Corporate Bank said the single currency
is testing a long-term channel resistance just ahead of pivotal
resistance at $1.4500. It said the Deutschmark never managed to
hold above its equivalent to this level since exchange rates
were floated.	
 The dollar index, which measures its strength against major
currencies, was trading at 74.938 , just above its
16-month low of 74.704 set on Wednesday. The index has lost just
over 5 percent since January.	
 Goldman Sachs said its models suggested the dollar is now
about 13 percent cheaper than its fair value on a trade-weighted
basis. However, only four out of 32 currencies of U.S. trading
partners weakened against the dollar this year, which Goldman
said would offer comfort to policymakers.	
 The dollar stood at 83.80 yen , off its 6-1/2 month
high around 85.55 set last week, finding support at its 200-day
moving average at around 83.43. 
 The area around 85.40/85.95 represents a 50 percent
retracement of the decline from its May peak, the September
highs and the critical downtrendline from the 2007 cycle high.	
 Expectations that the Fed will keep its monetary policy easy
are likely to underpin the yen against the dollar.	
 ""Lower expectations of Fed tightening will reduce the
incentives for investors to seek alternative funding currencies
such as the yen; similarly Japanese portfolio managers will be
under less pressure to reduce currency hedges,"" BNP Paribas said
in a note to clients.	
 ""Thus while the rationale for a weaker yen remains, that
weakness may not be expressed against the equally anaemic
dollar.""	
 The euro held near 121 yen , also off its 11-month
high around 123.30 set earlier this week.	
 Some people say the euro struggled to make fresh gains after
Germany acknowledged for the first time Greece may restructure
its debt. [ID:nLDE73C28V]

 * Bond prices higher across the curve
 * Bank of Canada reiterates warning on C$ strength
(Updates details and adds comment)
 TORONTO, April 13 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar finished
marginally higher against the greenback on Wednesday, as
warnings from the Bank of Canada that the currency's strength
could dampen economic growth kept it off recent highs and in a
tight range for much of the session.
 Central Bank Governor Mark Carney flagged the Canadian
dollar's sharp appreciation as an ""additional risk"" to the
outlook for growth and inflation at a news conference on
Wednesday, following release of the central bank's quarterly
Monetary Policy Report (MPR). [ID:nN13259704]
 His remarks reinforced comments by the central bank on
Tuesday about the currency's ""persistent strength"", after it
left interest rates steady at 1 percent. [ID:nN12172793]
 The strong Canadian dollar is seen as a drag on economic
growth as it makes exports more costly, notably with Canada's
main trading partner, the United States.
 The currency  finished at C$0.9624 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0391, up modestly from Tuesday's North American
finish of C$0.9631 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0383. That was
still well off 3-1/2 year highs hit last week when traders
positioned themselves ahead of the bank report.
 The detailed forecasts revealed in the bank's quarterly
Monetary Policy Report on Wednesday supported the view the
central bank is not about to lift interest rates next month.

 ""To me it looks likes they're going to give some guidance
to the market in May to move rates in July, so it's more for me
a confirmation that the normalization of the interest rate
cycle in Canada is closer to what we would have expected in
their January MPR,"" said Yanick Desnoyers, an economist at
National Bank Financial.
 ""They said explicitly they saw global risk decreasing
compared to January and they revised up Canadian growth, so to
me there's nothing negative in there.""
 A Reuters poll of economists and strategists released last
week forecast the bank making its first interest rate hike of
the year on July 19. [CA/POLL]
 Against the Bank of Canada backdrop, a rebound by equities
markets and oil prices also helped support the Canadian
dollar.
 ""You're seeing a certain consolidation in the currency
after yesterday's selloff,"" said David Tulk, chief Canada macro
strategist at TD Securities.
 Government bonds were higher and resumed their upward climb
on the reduced prospect of a near-term rate increase.
 The two-year bond , which is especially sensitive
to Bank of Canada policy moves, was was up 6 Canadian cents to
yield 1.825 percent, while the 10-year bond  gained
36 Canadian cents to yield 3.372 percent.

(Recasts, adds comments, details on Peru's sol)
 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, April 13 (Reuters) - Peru's sol slumped to its
weakest since December as investors worried a left-wing
nationalist would win a presidential run-off election, while
currencies in Brazil and Mexico firmed on slightly higher U.S.
stocks.
 Peruvian leftist presidential candidate Ollanta Humala won
a first-round vote on Sunday and will face right-wing candidate
Keiko Fujimori in a June 5 run-off.
 Humala's chief economics adviser told Reuters on Wednesday
that his boss's proposals have ""nothing to do"" with left-wing
models in Venezuela and Bolivia and that Humala would emphasize
economic stability if elected in June. [ID:nN13286700]
 Nonetheless, the sol  bid 0.36 percent weaker at
2.8190 per dollar.
 ""Peruvian assets are pricing in an increased risk premium
related to the possibility that Humala becomes president,"" said
Roberto Melzi, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.
 The rest of Latin America's key currencies firmed, with
Chile's peso getting a boost from an aggressive interest rate
hike on Tuesday that made Chilean debt more attractive for
foreign investors.
 Chile's peso  bid 0.36 percent stronger at 472 per
dollar.
 Brazil's real bounced back after recording its biggest
slump in three months in the previous session. Mexico's peso
also recovered from its sharpest losses in a month.
 U.S. stocks edged higher, rebounding from a steep sell-off
on hopes of solid first-quarter earnings.
 Traders said Latin American currencies would likely trade
in a range bounded by recent highs as investors eye whether
riskier assets like stocks, commodities and emerging market
currencies can resume a recent trend upward or lose steam.
 Investors will watch upcoming data in major economies to
see if high oil prices are weighing on global growth.
 ""We should be in a period of consolidation of the recent
gains and waiting for some data to see if we can continue
rallying, or if we could see a correction,"" said Jorge Perez
Duarte, a managing director for emerging markets at TD
Securities in Toronto.
 ""You really need to see stronger growth to keep fueling
this rally and the risk is to see weaker growth,"" he added.
 Mexico's peso  firmed 0.54 percent to 11.7702
per dollar after pulling back this week from its strongest
level since October 2008.
 Solid economic growth across Latin America, as well as
expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain ultra-low for
some time, has been supporting the region's currencies and
encouraging investors to snap up assets on dips.
 Investors have been borrowing funds in low-yield currencies
such as the dollar to buy Latin America's higher-yielding
debt.
 Brazil's real  bid 0.13 percent firmer to 1.589 per
dollar. Investors are betting that Brazilian authorities are
unwilling to implement stronger capital controls to contain the
real's recent gains.
 But central bank dollar purchases could contain the
currency's advance after the real surged around 5 percent in
the prior two weeks to hit its strongest since August 2008.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained
against the euro on Wednesday after President Barack Obama set
a goal to cut the U.S. budget deficit, but it failed to reverse
bearish sentiment driven by unfavorable interest rate
differentials.
 Obama set a goal of cutting the U.S. budget deficit by $4
trillion, plunging into the debate over the nation's fiscal
woes after accusations he has failed to lead on the issue.
 The deficit has prompted some market participants to
question the U.S. government's fiscal state and ability to
repay its debt, which in turn has weighed on the dollar.
 ""The fiscal austerity Obama is planning to introduce is
being received positively and there is optimism on the U.S.
economy,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT
in New York. ""But it's not enough to cause a full reversal in
the U.S. dollar.""
 Sentiment toward the dollar remains overwhelmingly bearish,
largely due to expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will
significantly lag global central banks in raising interest
rates.
 ""On the margin, I think the extent of cuts proposed by the
president are dollar positive in that they are expected to
bring down America's deficit to much more manageable levels in
the years ahead,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.2
percent at $1.4442, after earlier hitting a 15-month peak of
$1.4521 on EBS trading platform.
 Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in
Saddle River, New Jersey, said the euro's move below $1.4450
was technical, and moderate-size stops below $1.4450 were
activated when the trend line support at $1.4445 was breached.
 ""The support line went back 10 days to April 3,"" he said.
""Do not expect any permanent change in the euro.""
 The euro-zone currency could be vulnerable to pullbacks
after racking up about 8 percent gains this year. Overall,
though, the euro remained supported by the prospect of more
interest-rate hikes by the European Central Bank.
 Nomura Securities said that in addition to the ECB's
tightening, the euro has been supported by a decline in
systemic risk in the euro zone banking system, and a related
decline in the EUR risk premium has also been key.
 With a more hawkish ECB already priced in at this point,
the euro's systemic improvement is genuine and should hold in
the coming months, especially if euro-zone banks continue to
raise new capital, Nomura said.
 ""In this scenario, the risk premium can stay lower in
coming months, and EURUSD volatility will then increasingly
come from other factors. More traditional factors, such as
relative monetary policy, oil prices, and global USD direction
are high on this list of drivers.""
 Looking at those forces, a move toward $1.40 is likely by
the end of the second quarter, the firm said.
 Meanwhile, the yen fell against the dollar after rising
for four straight days, as risk appetite improved and the
currency's downtrend was seen intact as long as risk-taking
holds up.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 83.80 yen after sliding
more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday in its biggest one-day fall
in four months.
 Against the yen, the euro was nearly unchanged at 121.04
yen, well below an 11-month high of 123.33 yen hit on Monday.
 The negative impact on Japan's economy from the recent
earthquake should ensure Japanese monetary policy remains
ultra-loose for a prolonged period. That should prompt
investors to use the yen as a funding currency in carry
trades.

 NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. bonds and the dollar
rose on Wednesday on hopes that President Barack Obama's $4
trillion deficit reduction plan would shore up the United
States' credit-worthiness and the dollar's reserve status.
 Oil jumped 1.5 percent, recovering from two days of losses,
after data showed the biggest weekly decline in gasoline
inventory since October 1998. For more, see [ID:nLDE73C0V1]
 Obama set a time-frame of 12 years or less to reach the
goal of $4 trillion in U.S. deficit reduction as he warned that
steadily rising debt could cost jobs, harm the economy and
force Washington to borrow more from other countries such as
China. [ID:nN12216395]
 ""It's a positive from a credit and currency perspective.
It's positive in the sense that the U.S. can (better) meet its
obligations,"" said James Caron, global head of rates research
at Morgan Stanley in New York.
 The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year government debt fell to
the lowest level in a week, while the dollar posted gains
versus the yen and euro.
 As government leaders wrestle over how to tackle United
States' long-term fiscal predicament, investors were reticent to commit to stocks and other risky assets on uncertainties
over the durability of global economic and profit growth.
 Wall Street ended flat to slightly higher after struggling
much of the session on doubts over corporate profits. An
initial rise in U.S. stocks fizzled, despite strong profit
growth from JPMorgan Chase & Co , the No. 2 U.S. bank.
Analysts questioned whether the results from JPMorgan, the
first major Wall Street bank to report this quarter, were a
one-time win or a harbinger of others' performance. For more,
see [.N]
 The view reined in a rebound in global stocks.
 ""People are getting the sense that no matter what these
companies say, the easy money has already been made so it will
be tough to see further upward movement,"" said Rick Fier, vice
president at Conifer Securities in New York, which has about $7
billion in assets under administration.

 NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell from a

President Barack Obama unveiled deficit cuts that were deemed
positive for the dollar.
 Overall sentiment toward the greenback, however, remains
largely bearish given expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve

pullbacks after racking up about 8 percent gains this year.
 Overall, though, the euro remained supported by the
prospect of more interest-rate increases by the European
Central Bank.

 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro  was
down 0.3 percent at $1.4437, having earlier hit $1.4521, a
15-month peak on EBS trading platform.
 Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in
Saddle River, New Jersey, said the euro's move below $1.4450
was technical and moderate-size stops below $1.4450 were
activated when the trend line support at $1.4445 was
breached.
 ""The support line went back 10 days to April 3,"" he said.
""Do not expect any permanent change in the euro.""
 Technical analysts said the euro's uptrend remained intact
while the currency is above $1.4250/80 -- the area from which
the euro bounced toward current highs. A sustained break above
$1.4600 could open up the path for a test of $1.5000.
 The options market, however, isn't following the move in
spot prices.

 Options investors are still betting on a decline in the
euro against the dollar, with risk reversals for one-month
options still showing a solid bias for ""puts"". Wednesday,
euro risk reversals were at -1.35 .
 Meanwhile, the yen fell against the dollar after rising
for four straight days, as risk appetite improved and the
currency's downtrend was seen intact as long as risk-taking
holds up.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 83.83 yen  after
sliding more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday for its biggest
one-day fall in four months.
 The negative impact on Japan's economy from the recent
earthquake should ensure Japanese monetary policy remains
ultra-loose for a prolonged period. That should prompt
investors to use the yen as a funding currency in carry
trades.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at 120.96 yen ,
well below an 11-month high of 123.33 yen hit on Monday.
 The U.S. government's budget debate is likely to get
heated in the coming weeks, with the looming debt ceiling
expected to be a major issue possibly weighing on the dollar.
The U.S. Treasury has estimated the government is about $95
billion away from hitting its debt ceiling and this could be
well be reached by mid-May.

 * Analyst says ""another breakdown"" in talks a possibility
(Adds analyst comments)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, April 13 (Reuters) - The fate of long-running
world trade talks depend on whether China, India and Brazil are
willing to make a deal that will open their markets to
additional foreign goods and services, U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk said on Wednesday.
 ""If I can just be blunt, the question is whether they are
willing to walk in the room, close the door and hammer out a
deal,"" Kirk said in a speech at a trade symposium hosted by
U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
 The remark came a day after European Union Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht warned that the nearly 10-year-old
Doha round of trade talks were at a difficult stage and there
was ""no reason to be optimistic"" about the chances of success.
 ""We're still at the table,"" Kirk said. ""There's an anxiety
that we may not get there. But we think it would be a real
shame if we weren't able to find a way to rationalize global
trade and get a Doha deal that works for everyone.""
 Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute
for International Economics, said Kirk and De Gucht's comments
show the ""precarious"" state of the talks one week before the
World Trade Organization is due to release new draft texts for
the supposedly final stage of negotiations.
 ""I suspect there are last gasp efforts right now to try to
avoid another breakdown,"" Schott said, referring to the
numerous setbacks and missed deadlines in the talks since they
were launched in late 2001 in Doha, Qatar.
 ""It's very hard to see how there would be a positive
response to the secretariat's overtures unless there was some
prospect that the major trading nations were going to offer
more at the negotiating table,"" Schott said.
 China, India and Brazil don't bear all the responsibility
for the state of the talks, but each has its own reasons for
resisting U.S. pressure for deeper market openings than they
have offered so far, Schott said.
 China argues it has already opened its market more than
most developing countries, while Brazil and to some extent
India worry about the competition their manufacturers will face
from China if they make deep tariff cuts, he said.
 Brazil, a major agricultural exporter, also has complained
about the amount of farm subsidy and tariff cuts the United
States and the European Union are willing to make in exchange
for the new market openings they want.
 Kirk said developing countries often complain that the
United States and the European Union have long dominated the
process of establishing the international rules for trade.
 ""We've gladly opened that door and shown them we have three
more chairs: one for China, one for India and one for Brazil.""
 ""No three economies have benefited more from trade
liberalization over the last 10 years than China, India and
Brazil. That's a good thing,"" Kirk said.
 ""But with that blessing comes a responsibility, and we
believe China, India and Brazil have the opportunity to find
out just how bloody awful it is to bring these things to a
close,"" Kirk said.
 Despite De Gucht's bleak assessment of the talks, Kirk said
he thought substantial progress had been made over the past 18
months in persuading other WTO members that a draft July 2008
deal did not do enough to open markets to more trade.

 NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Global stock markets
recovered on Wednesday from a sharp sell-off, and the yen
slipped after Japan scaled back its economic outlook due to
last month's earthquake and tsunami.
 Commodity prices reversed a steep two-day decline, led by
oil after data showed the largest weekly fall in gasoline
inventories since 1998.
 On Wall Street, however, stocks struggled to maintain
gains, despite strong profit growth from JPMorgan Chase & Co
, the No. 2 U.S. bank. Analysts questioned whether the
results from JPMorgan, the first major Wall Street bank to
report this quarter, were a one-time win or would translate to
others' performance.

 ""Economic fundamentals are supportive for stocks and
commodities, which are all predicated on global growth,"" said
Mark Luschini, chief market strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott based in Philadelphia.
 Prices of Brent crude oil rose above $122 a barrel,
rebounding from a two-day sell-off caused by worries that high
prices would crimp demand, while gold firmed on a weaker U.S.
dollar.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up

the gain came from emerging markets <.MSCIEF>, which gained

pension and healthcare plans. [ID:nN12216395]
 The dollar has weakened against most major currencies this
year on concerns over the huge $1.5 trillion federal budget.
 The U.S. dollar, however, has firmed versus the yen since
late March as Japan faces the daunting task of rebuilding after
the ravaging quake and tsunamis that hit the country last
month.
 The benchmark Nikkei index <.N225> rose 0.9 percent on the
day in thin volume. Analysts suggested the full impact of the
country's disasters, as outlined in the government's new

 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, April 13 (Reuters) - Latin America's biggest
currencies firmed on Wednesday on a rebound in U.S. stocks and
commodity prices, and Chile's peso got a boost from an
aggressive interest rate hike on Tuesday.
 Brazil's real bounced back after recording its biggest
slump in three months in the previous session. Mexico's peso
was also recovering from its sharpest losses in a month.
 Traders said Latin American currencies would likely trade
in a range bounded by recent highs as investors eye whether
riskier assets like stocks, commodities and emerging market
currencies can resume a recent uptrend or lose steam.
 ""We should be in a period of consolidation of the recent
gains and waiting for some data to see if we can continue
rallying, or if we could see a correction,"" said Jorge Perez
Duarte, a managing director for emerging markets at TD
Securities in Toronto.
 ""You really need to see stronger growth to keep fueling
this rally and the risk is to see weaker growth,"" he added.
 Investors will watch upcoming data in major economies such
as the United States to see if high oil prices are weighing on
global growth.
 Mexico's peso  firmed 0.31 percent to 11.7985
per dollar after pulling back this week from its strongest
level since October 2008.
 Backing Wednesday's rebound, U.S. stocks rose after
JPMorgan Chase's earnings beat expectations and spurred bets
that other banks' results will be strong. [.N]
 Solid economic growth across Latin America, as well as
expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain ultra-low for
some time, are supporting the region's currencies and
encouraging investors to snap up assets on dips.
 Investors have been borrowing funds in low-yield currencies
such as the dollar to buy Latin America's higher-yielding
debt.
 Brazil's real  bid 0.25 percent firmer to 1.587 per
dollar. Investors are betting that Brazilian authorities are
unwilling to implement stronger capital controls to contain the
real's recent gains.
 But central bank dollar purchases could contain the
currency's advance after the real surged around 5 percent in
the prior 2 weeks to hit its strongest since August 2008.
 ""I do not think they will take more drastic steps, because
inflation is out of control,"" said Mario Battistel at brokerage
Fair. ""Let us see if the central bank interventions can hold
the real,"" he added.
 Chile's peso  bid 0.37 percent stronger at 472 per
dollar. Chile's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate
on Tuesday to the highest level in more than two years, as it
tries to get ahead of inflation expectations. [ID:nN12148345]

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - The yen slipped on Wednesday
after rising four straight days, as risk appetite improved on
global stocks gains, and the currency's downtrend was seen
intact as long as risk-taking holds up.
 The negative impact on Japan's economy from the recent
earthquake should ensure Japanese monetary policy remains
ultra-loose for a prolonged period. That should prompt
investors to use the yen as a funding currency in carry trades.
 There had been a retracement in risky trades the past few
days because of Japan's nuclear power crisis and some lingering
worries about euro zone debt problems, resulting in yen
strength.
 Analysts warned that cautious market sentiment could return
by Thursday due to U.S. budget and debt ceiling talks, as well
as uncertainties about the economic impact of Japan's crises.
 ""There is a more of a positive risk environment today,""
said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in
New York. ""But this may change tomorrow, and the yen may be
back up. It just goes to show how risk sentiment plays a big
part in the currency market.""
 Currency investors are expected to focus on President
Barack Obama's budget speech later in the session especially
after a budget showdown last week that almost shuttered U.S.
government offices.
 The budget debate is likely to get heated in the coming
weeks, with the looming debt ceiling expected to be a major
issue possibly weighing on the dollar. The U.S. Treasury has
estimated the government is about $95 billion away from hitting
its debt ceiling and this could be well be reached by mid-May.
 Analysts believe the debt limit will be raised eventually,
which has happened in recent years.
 ""The road to that eventuality could be a very bumpy one for
the dollar, particularly if foreign investors perceive even a
modest increase in the risk a deal on the debt ceiling will not
be reached in time,"" said Bob Lynch, HSBC's head of G10 FX
strategy for the Americas, in New York.
 The euro, meanwhile, traded flat against the greenback,
after earlier hitting a fresh 15-month high.
 The single euro zone currency could be vulnerable to
pullbacks after racking up about 8 percent gains this year.
Overall though, the euro remained supported by the prospect of
more interest rate increases by the European Central Bank.
 In midday New York trading, the dollar was up 0.1 percent
at 83.72 yen after sliding more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday for
its biggest one-day fall in four months.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent as well at 121.28 yen
EURJPY=R>, although it was well below an 11-month high of
123.33 yen hit on Monday.
 The euro was little changed at $1.4478, having earlier hit
$1.4521, a 15-month peak on EBS trading platform.
 Also supporting the euro's positive outlook were comments
from ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene. On Wednesday,
Coene said the ECB's rate increase last week should not be
viewed as an isolated decision. See.
 The euro's gains were slowed by persistent option-related
offers. Traders said a barrier at $1.4530 was being defended,
expiring on Friday. A break above there would target the 2010
highs around $1.4582.
 Technical analysts said the uptrend remained intact while
the currency is above $1.4250/80 -- the area from which the

one-month options still showing a solid bias for ""puts"". On
Wednesday, euro risk reversals were at -1.35.
 Analysts said there is a squeeze going on in the options
market between market makers, who provide liquidity, and
institutional buyers, who seem skeptical that the euro will
keep on rising given persistent sovereign debt problems.

 * Daily commodity price movements should be limited
 * Transaction register, position reports favoured
 HAMBURG, April 13 (Reuters) - Germany supports French
proposals for commodity market regulation and believes limits on
commodity trading positions should be considered, German
Agriculture and Consumer Protection Minister Ilse Aigner said.
 Limits on positions individual investors can hold in
commodities along with limits on daily price movements are
""worth considering"", Aigner said in a statement on Wednesday.
 France said on Monday it would urge G20 nations this week to
support limits on trading positions and margin calls in
commodities markets, allowing for intervention at times of
proven instability.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy has called for tough
measures to limit speculation in commodities markets, which he
blames for driving up global prices of oil and food.
 Aigner said on Wednesday that more transparency was needed
in agricultural commodities markets to limit the impact of
speculation.
 ""Germany supports the initiative from France, in the
framework of the G20, for an action plan to improve the global
food situation and to contain extreme price movements,"" Aigner
said.
 The G20 group, which includes rich and developing nations
such as China, India and Brazil, is meeting in Washington this
week. France says it will push for backing of its plan to
restrict outside financial investment in commodities markets.
 Aigner said limits on daily commodity price movements should
be considered for specific products including grains and
soybeans.
 Market oversight authorities could then intervene
automatically and decide whether trade should be temporarily
stopped, she said.
 Regular reports on commodity market trading positions,
common in the United States, should also be introduced
elsewhere, she said.
 ""A prime principle must be more transparency,"" she said.
 It must be clear to all sides which groups are using the
commodity markets for financial investment and which are seeking
to actually buy the raw materials themselves, she said.
 ""This could be commodity traders who wish to hedge their
risks or pure financial jugglers playing poker for fast profit,""
she said.
 A transaction register for commodities markets would also
create transparency and the possibility to intervene if
necessary, she said.

said. ""Food and agricultural commodities are not just another
product. They involve the basis of life for billions of people.""

 * Lawmakers have consultation right only over EFSF payments
 * German FinMin to push for same model for ESM funds
 
(Recast, adds quotes from finmin, analysts, lawmakers)
 By Andreas Rinke
 BERLIN, April 13 (Reuters) - German lawmakers should have a
right of veto over the country's contributions to a permanent
fund being set up to bail out fiscally troubled euro zone
states, senior politicians said on Wednesday.
 The European Stability Mechanism is due to come into force
in 2013 with 80 billion euros in cash reserves meant to assure
it holds a triple-A rating.
 Europe's dominant economy has undertaken to pay 21.7 billion
of that into the fund, which will replace the smaller, temporary
European Financial Stability Facility being tapped by bailout
beneficiaries Ireland and Portugal.
 The ESM will also be backed by 620 billion euros of
guarantees, increasing the euro zone's potential firepower for
dealing with future financial crises and in effect committing
member states to additional contributions if required.
 Analysts said there was little risk that action by German
lawmakers would hinder the functioning of the ESM, though it was
clear parliament would press to retain the ability to
potentially control the terms of bailouts.
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he expected
parliament to approve any funding requests.

 PARLIAMENTARY RIGHTS
 Germany's lower parliamentary house, the Bundestag, has the
right of consultation over EFSF payments, and the country is
embroiled in a debate over whether contributions into the ESM
should face the same level of scrutiny, be waved through
automatically or require full approval.
 The issue resurfaced after a warning from the auditors'
court led some members of the Bundestag's budget committee to
demand that any payments into the ESM beyond the initial
contributions should face a parliamentary vote.
 ""By all means, the German Bundestag (lower house of
parliament) must approve (them),"" said Birgit Homburger,
parliamentary floor leader of the junior coalition partner, the
Free Democrats (FDP).
 ""It is clear that budget rules (requiring parliamentary
approval for bailout funding) must be adhered to,"" said Michael
Meister, deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela
Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party.
 However, Germany needed to take care ""not to create rules
that bring instability again to financial markets,"" he added.
 Schaeuble moved to take the heat out of the debate, telling
parliament at question time he expected authorisation of the ESM
funding agreed by European leaders.
 ""We are very much at the beginning of the consultations...
the details must still be negotiated in a treaty that needs the
ratification of German legislators,"" he said.
 He said he would recommend the approval process for ESM
payments follow the model used for the EFSF.
 Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy
Studies in Brussels, said parliamentary concerns would be very
unlikely to hinder the successful operation of the ESM.

(Recasts with Carney news conference)
 By Randall Palmer and Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, April 13 (Reuters) - Canada's strong currency is
dampening economic growth and keeping inflation low, Bank of
Canada Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday, reinforcing
expectations that he won't hike interest rates next month.
 In a news conference following release of the central
bank's quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR), Carney was asked
whether the sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar was
effectively tightening monetary conditions, allowing the bank
to delay rate hikes. [ID:nN13293182]
 ""We have to take all factors into account and certainly one
of the most important factors at the moment are the strong
headwinds the Canadian economy is experiencing now and will in
the future from the persistent strength in the Canadian
dollar,"" Carney said.
 ""In the report this is not just a factor that is in the
base case projection but it's also an additional risk to the
outlook to growth and inflation in Canada,"" he added.
 It was the second straight day central bank voiced its
concerns about Canada'a soaring currency, which last week hit a
3-1/2 year high against the U.S. dollar.
 Analysts said the bank's discomfort with the strength of
the currency has grown in recent months, evidenced by its
repeated references to the exchange rate in Tuesday's policy
announcement, the MPR, and Carney's news conference.
 ""The loonie's flight plan now appears to be even more of a
critical factor affecting the future timing and magnitude of
policy rate hikes,"" said Michael Gregory, senior economist at
BMO Capital Markets. ""But it won't prevent them.""
 The bank held its key overnight target steady at 1 percent
on Tuesday. It has been on pause on rates since September after
becoming the first central bank in the G7 to lift rates
following the global crisis. [ID:nN12172793]
 Analysts polled last week saw July as the most likely date
for the next rate increase. [CA/POLL]
 Swaps that trade based on expectations for the key policy
rate showed that after the MPR's release and Carney's comments
the market trimmed odds of a rate increase at each bank
decision date from May through December. 
 The Canadian dollar also hit a session low of C$0.9656 to
the U.S. dollar, or $1.0356 after the news conference from
C$0.9621 before the MPR release.
 The bank's forecasts through to the end of 2013 assume
gradual rate increases over that period, and the economy
returning to full capacity by mid-2012.
 Given that rate increases can take 12 to 18 months to feed
through to the economy, some have speculated the bank would
want to move in the current quarter if it wants to prevent the
economy from overheating when it reaches full capacity at
mid-2012. But Carney offered little guidance.
 The bank said that inflation is tame now and will return to
its 2 percent target by mid-2012, despite some short-term
pressures from food and energy.
 JAPAN EFFECT
 Economic growth will fall sharply in the second quarter to
an annualized 2 percent from 4.2 percent in the first due
largely to the Japanese earthquake and the effects of the
strong Canadian dollar on exports, the bank said.
 The Japanese disaster will shave half a percentage point
off growth in the second quarter, the bank estimated, due
primarily to supply disruptions in the auto sector.
 It saw that loss recovered in subsequent quarters.
 The bank downgraded growth forecasts for every other
quarter this year and next, compared with its January
projections. It sees the economy expanding 2.7 percent in the
final two quarters of this year.
 Early evidence suggests that the strong rebound in exports
will not continue and that net exports were a drag on
first-quarter growth, it said.
 The bank cited ""ongoing competitiveness challenges,
including headwinds from the persistent strength in the
Canadian dollar, as well as the one-off nature of certain
elements of the rebound"" for the slower growth rates.

 * H2 recovery will not raise growth to previous levels
 
 By Mariam Karouny 
 BEIRUT, April 13 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund
said on Wednesday Lebanon's 2011 economic growth rate would fall
to 2.5 percent from an average annual 8.0 percent over the last
four years, due largely to political uncertainty.
 The IMF said in a statement that it expected Lebanon's
inflation to rise to 6.5 percent due to pressure from rising oil
and food prices on world markets.
 Lebanon had predicted GDP growth of 7 to 8 percent in 2011,
but revised that projection down to 5 percent late last year. It
also projected inflation would drop to 2.8 percent.
 ""This represents a sharp deceleration from the average 8
percent annually over the past four years, and largely reflects
the impact of continued political uncertainty in the country and
the region,"" the statement said.
 ""The staff's growth projection takes into account the weak
economic activity observed in the first quarter of 2011. The
political impasse, coupled with the regional turmoil, is
affecting commercial activity, tourism, and real estate
investment -- the main drivers of the Lebanese economy.""
 Political wrangling blocked parliamentary approval of
Lebanon's 2010 budget, and the 2011 draft budget has yet to gain
cabinet approval.
 Lebanon has been without a functioning government since
ministers from the Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its allies
resigned in January, toppling the government of Saad al-Hariri.
 Lebanese leaders are divided over a U.N.-backed tribunal
investigating the 2005 killing of statesman Rafik al-Hariri,
Saad's father. The divisions turned violent in 2008 and put
Lebanon on the brink of a civil war.
 The tribunal will issue its first indictments this year and
it is expected to accuse Hezbollah members over the 2005
killing. Hezbollah says the court is an ""Israeli tool"" and asked
Hariri to repudiate it. He refused.
 Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati tried to form a unity
government bringing together all sides, but Hariri and his
allies refused to join. 
 Mikati has not been able to form a government due to
conflict among Hezbollah's allies and President Michel Suleiman
over allocation of ministerial portfolios.
 The IMF said that even an assumed recovery in the second
half of the year would be insufficient to raise the annual
growth rate to its recent levels. 
 ""The delay in government formation will likely postpone
implementation of public investment spending to the latter part
of the year or even 2012, thereby limiting possible fiscal
stimulus,"" it said.
 Inflation ranged between 1.5 and 4 percent in 2009 after
peaking at 14 percent in 2008. Lebanon remains one of the most
highly-indebted countries in the world relative to the size of
its economy.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday
after rising four straight days against the dollar and euro, as
risk appetite improved following gains in global stocks from
better-than-expected JPMorgan earnings.
 The Japanese currency's downtrend should stay intact as
long as risk appetite holds up. The negative impact on the
economy of the recent massive earthquake is expected to ensure
Japanese monetary policy remains ultra-loose for a prolonged
period.
 There had been a retracement in risky trades the past few
days because of Japan's nuclear power crisis and some lingering
worries about euro zone debt problems, resulting in yen
strength. Analysts warned that cautious market sentiment could
return by Thursday.
 The yen tends to fall when there is increased risk-taking
in the market as investors sell assets funded by the
low-yielding Japanese currency in carry trades.
 ""There is a more of a positive risk environment today,""
said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in
New York. ""But this may change tomorrow, and the yen may be
back up tomorrow. It just goes to show how risk sentiment plays
a big part in the currency market.""
 U.S. stocks opened higher after JPMorgan Chase's earnings
beat expectations and spurred bets that other banks' results
will be strong.
 The euro, meanwhile, edged higher against the greenback,
hitting a fresh 15-month high, boosted by reported demand from
sovereign names looking to recycle dollar proceeds.
 The single euro zone currency would be vulnerable to
pullbacks after racking up gains, but overall, the euro
remained supported by the prospect of more interest rate
increases by the European Central Bank.
 In early New York trading, the dollar was up 0.5 percent at
84.03 yen after sliding more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday for
its biggest one-day percentage drop in four months.
 The euro was up 0.5 percent on the day at 121.67 yen,
although it was well below an 11-month high of 123.33 yen hit
on Monday.
 The euro was little changed at $1.4484, having earlier hit
$1.4521, a 15-month peak on EBS trading platform, narrowly
surpassing Tuesday's $1.4520 high.
 Further supporting the euro's positive outlook were
comments from ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene. On
Wednesday, Coene said the ECB's interest rate increase last
week should not be considered as an isolated decision. For more
click on.
 The euro's gains were slowed by persistent option-related
offers. Traders said a barrier at $1.4530 was being defended,
expiring on Friday. A break above there would target the 2010
highs around $1.4582.
 Technical analysts said the uptrend remained intact while
the currency is above $1.4250/80 -- the area from which the
euro bounced toward current highs. A sustained break above
$1.4600 could open up the path for a test of $1.5000.
 The options market, however, isn't following the move in
spot prices.
 Options investors are still betting on a decline in the
euro against the dollar, with risk reversals for one-month
options still showing a solid bias for ""puts"". On Wednesday,
euro risk reversals were at -1.35.
 Analysts said there is a tug-of-war going on in the options
market between the market makers, which provide liquidity, and
the institutional buyers, which seem skeptical that the euro
will keep on rising given persistent euro zone fiscal stress.
 Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars also rose, buoyed by a recovery in commodity
prices and stocks.

 * Investors await outstanding coupon payments, maybe in June
 * Concern over other pressures on government coffers

 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Investors have been buying
Ivory Coast's $2.3 billion bond in the hope new President
Alassane Ouattara will soon lift it out of default, but concern
over Ouattara's priorities is injecting a note of caution.
 Ivory Coast defaulted on the bond at the end of January --
effectively freezing the world's top cocoa producer out of
international markets -- while in the throes of fighting
following last November's disputed presidential election. 
 Ouattara, internationally recognised as the winner of that
election, is sole leader of the country following the capture of
his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo on Monday.
 The bond fell below 40 cents on the dollar after the
default, but has been recovering in recent weeks.
 It was trading at 53.4 on Wednesday, though that is below
four-month highs hit last week in anticipation of a victory for
Ouattara, reflecting some investor caution.
 Ivory Coast needs to make an outstanding $29 million coupon
payment on the bond, and resume future coupon payments, to end
the default.
 ""If there are no significant setbacks on the way, then the
market expectation would be to get a resumption of the coupon
payments,"" said Kevin Daly, emerging debt fund manager at
Aberdeen Asset Management, which holds the bond.
 ""Probably the expectation is that the earliest anyone will
get paid is June, when the next coupon gets paid. At this point,
there are larger priorities.""
 Ouattara is likely to focus on stabilising the security
situation, winning over Gbagbo supporters who made up 46 percent
of the electorate in November, and seeking international aid to
get the economy back on its feet, investors say.
 He has already won indications of support from France, which
was instrumental in capturing Gbagbo, the European Union and the
World Bank. The World Bank froze aid to the country in December.
 ""Without the French, Gbagbo would be still in his bunker and
Ouattara will be very dependent on foreign and donor support
going forward,"" said Hannah Koep, Africa analyst at consultancy
Control Risks.
 
 COCOA TAXES
 At first blush, it looks quite easy for Ivory Coast to make
a $29 million payment, along with a subsequent $29 million
payment in June.
 Ivory Coast, which exports 40 percent of the world's cocoa,
stands to make around $600 million a year in export taxes, at
current cocoa prices.
 Gbagbo's arrest and the lifting of European Union sanctions
on Ivory Coast's two main ports mean cocoa exports may be
possible by next week, dealers say.
 However, the banking system has been heavily disrupted,
administrative functions such as export tax collection are
paralysed and Ouattara has a number of factions to appease.
 ""Ouattara is probably going to pay his army first before
solving the default,"" said David Dowsett, senior portfolio
manager at Bluebay Asset Management, which does not hold the
bond, adding:
 ""We don't know the state of the central bank reserves.""
 Ivorian reserves held at the West African central bank
(BCEAO) were estimated at around $3 billion before the crisis,
but investors speculate they could now be much lower.
 Analysts also point to the disruption to the economy caused
by the civil war, in which more than 1,000 people were killed.
 Ivory Coast was heading for 3 percent growth in 2010 but
growth came to a standstill over the past four months, said
Barclays Capital analysts in a note.
 ""It will take some time before annual growth reaches
pre-crisis levels,"" Barclays said.
 ""Public finances are likely to remain under pressure for
some time.""
 While the bond has risen, investors say it would be higher
still if they were more confident about payment.
 ""We do expect the bond to rise. It was trading in the
low-60s last year and that's the target to get to,"" said Sergei
Strigo, head of emerging markets debt at Amundi Asset
Management, which holds the bond.
 ""But first we need to see some normalising of the situation,
the government being formed and obviously a statement on the
resumption of coupon payments.""
 Longer term, analysts see the 2032 bond, which has an
amortising structure allowing repayment of the principal from
2016, reaching levels around 80 cents on the dollar.
 Ivory Coast has a chequered debt payment history, having
failed to service its debt on two previous occasions.
 But Ouattara may feel he owes a debt to the international
community, following France's help in capturing Gbagbo.
 The change of presidency, after Gbagbo's hold on power since
2000, is also injecting new optimism.
 ""This country has been shut out to foreign investment for
the last decade,"" said Daly.
 ""If you start to get money coming back in, that will be very
positive.""

319,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2011 08:20AM ET</span>",Polish energy exports likely to rise in 2011-PSE," WARSAW, April 13 (Reuters) - Poland's energy exports will
rise this year after Germany's decision to phase out its oldest
nuclear plants, which lifted prices and margins, the deputy head
of grid operator PSE said on Wednesday.
 A nuclear crisis in Japan following an earthquake and
tsunami led Germany to shut its seven oldest nuclear power
plants for at least three months, which increased demand for
wind-generated power.
 German wind power producers shifted to supplying their
domestic market after previously exporting to the Czech Republic
via Poland. That opened up an opportunity for Poland to supply
Germany and the Czech Republic.
 ""We saw exports jump after Germany's decision, not only
because prices rose, but also because the amount of
wind-generated power flowing through Poland to the Czech
Republic dropped significantly, freeing capacities,"" Jerzy
Andruszkiewicz told reporters.
 Poland's surplus in the trade of power rose two and half
times to 1.6 gigawatt-hours in the first three months of 2011,
PSE operator data showed.
 Andruszkiewicz added that a bigger rise in foreign energy
trade will be possible in 2014, when a network upgrade in Poland
will make some 400 megawatts in capacity available for trade.
 The European Union's largest ex-communist economy remains a
largely isolated energy market with foreign trade a mere 4-5
percent of annual power production, which the European
Commission wants to change with its single energy market plan by
2015.

 * Potash importers, lawmakers worry about higher prices
 
 BRUSSELS, April 13 (Reuters) - European potash firms have
asked the European Commission to maintain import duties on
potash from Russia and Belarus and protect European production
of a crucial farming input, sources said on Wednesday.
 EU producers want Russia's Silvinit and Uralkali to have
duties of up to 27.5 percent imposed on sales to Europe for at
least a further five years, rather than expiry of the measures
this summer, European producers demanded, according to sources
familiar with the case.
 ""The request for an extension has been submitted,"" said one
of the sources.
 A spokesman for German potash firm K+S had said the request
would be lodged this week -- to meet a legal deadline on
Wednesday.
 The prospect of a tariff extension has triggered warnings by
EU lawmakers of soaring fertiliser costs for cash-strapped
farmers, with rising global food demand having turned potash
into a sought-after commodity.
 ""The European Commission should examine the impact of
continuing these measures, particularly with regards to farm
production costs and food prices,"" four EU deputies said in a
letter to the EU's trade and farm commissioners dated April 7.
 ""There is no substitute for potash in agriculture and it is
therefore an essential product in order to maintain and expand
food production.""
 EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, pressed on the issue
at the European Parliament on Tuesday, defended the principle of
duty extensions, even on products in tight supply.
 ""What we do is apply objective criteria in anti-dumping,"" De
Gucht told EU lawmakers.
 The European Potash Producers Association, which represents
Germany's K+S and Israel Chemicals Limited operations in Britain
and Spain, says duties are critical in stopping an unchecked
flow of potash into the European Union at illegally low prices.
 If the Commission accepts the request within the next three
months as it is broadly expected to do, it has up to 15 months
to decide on a duty rollover. During that time the duties, which
were first imposed in 1992, will stay in place.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - The euro edged to a 15-month
high against the dollar while the yen slipped broadly on
Wednesday as a bout of global risk reduction abated and
investors sought currencies promising higher yield.
 The euro was lifted by reported demand from sovereign names
looking to recycle dollar proceeds as the single currency
remained supported by the prospect of further rate rises in the
euro zone while policy stays loose in the United States and
Japan.
 The European Central Bank's increase of interest rates last
week should not be considered as an isolated decision and the
ECB president has signalled that it was not a one-off, ECB
Governing Council member Luc Coene said on Wednesday.
[ID:nLDE73C13A]
 ""Some positioning indicators are pointing at an aggressive
pick-up in euro long positions. What started as a
sovereign-driven dollar recycling move seems to be gaining
traction,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi.
 ""But we could see a shift if positioning starts to look
stretched in the near term and given that a lot of the positives
for the euro are already in the price"".
 Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars also rose, buoyed by a recovery in commodity
prices and stocks, while the yen -- the most popular funding
currency to buy higher-yielding assets, the process known as
carry trades -- retreated after gaining on Tuesday.
 The euro  was up 0.1 percent at $1.4506, having
earlier hit $1.4521 on EBS trading platform, narrowly surpassing
Tuesday's $1.4520 high. Its gains were slowed by persistent
option-related offers. Traders said a barrier at $1.4530 was
being defended, expiring on Friday. A break above there would
target the 2010 highs around $1.4582. 
 Technical analysts said the uptrend remained intact while
the currency is above $1.4250/80 -- the area from which the euro
bounced towards its current highs -- while a sustained break
above $1.4600 could open up the path for a test of $1.500.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.7 percent on the day at
121.91 yen , though it stayed well below an 11-month
high of 123.33 yen hit on Monday.
 ""If there is no pullback in oil and other commodity prices
then I think going forward the yen will be very vulnerable,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.

 YEN FALLS
 The yen's downtrend was seen staying intact as long as risk
appetite holds up. The negative impact on the economy of the
recent massive earthquake was expected to ensure Japanese
monetary policy remains ultra-loose for a prolonged period.
 The Japanese government's downgrading of its assessment of
the economy for the first time in six months added weight to
this view. [ID:nL3E7FD0DS]
 The dollar  was up 0.5 percent at 84.07 yen 
after sliding more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday for its biggest
one-day percentage drop in four months.
 Global equities and commodities recovered on Wednesday from
falls the previous day, when an upgrade of the severity of
Japan's nuclear crisis turned investors more risk-averse,
prompting them to unwind some of their recent yen-funded carry
trades.
 ""This selling-off has provided the opportunity to buy
USD/JPY but caution is advised as risk sentiment does remain
fragile,"" said a Tokyo-based trader, adding he saw a range of
83.00-86.00 yen.
 The dollar continued to be supported by its 200-day moving
average -- currently around 83.46 yen -- having bounced off that
level on Tuesday. More support lies at 83.34 yen, the 23.6
percent retracement of the dollar's mid-March to April rally,
and 83.30 yen, the dollar's March 11 intraday high.
 Short-term resistance lies at 84.33 yen, the conversion line
on the daily Ichimoku chart, a form of Japanese technical
analysis widely used among market players. Reported option
expiries at 83.20, 83.90, 84.00, 84.50 and 85.00 yen also
pointed to dollar/yen being trapped in a range.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.5 percent at $1.0493 
to come closer to its recent 29-year high of $1.0585. It was up
more than 1 percent versus the yen  at 88.19 yen,
regaining ground after a 1.8 percent slide on Tuesday.

 SINGAPORE, April 13 (Reuters) - Maersk said it would most

container ships to be built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering at a cost of $1.9 billion.
 The world's largest container firm ordered ten 18,000

option for another 20 similar vessels. Each vessel costs $190
million.
 ""The first decision will come in June and we do expect we

Executive Nils Andersen told reporters after an industry event
in Singapore on Wednesday.
 Maersk will decide later in the year whether to exercise the
last option for 10 more mega ships.
 A senior Maersk official in February said the option on the
final 10 vessels was a long shot.
 The new ships will add to Maersk Line's current fleet of
more than 600 vessels and help it keep its industry-leading
market position.
 The Triple-E class vessels, measuring 400 metres (1,312

326,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2011 07:00AM ET</span>",Debutante S.Africa adds political cement to BRICS," By Jon Herskovitz	
 JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Reuters) - In terms of its economic
might, South Africa hardly deserves a seat at the table when the
leaders of the BRIC group of major emerging economies meet this
week in China.	
 But the country, which is making its debut at the summit,
has earned a spot politically as the stepping stone to the
quickly emerging states of sub-Saharan Africa, which helps
expand the geographic reach of the original BRIC states --
Brazil Russia, India and China.	
 ""This is a diplomatic achievement for South Africa, not an
economic one,"" said Anne Fruhauf, an analyst for Africa for the
Eurasia Group.	
 South Africa, with a $285 billion economy, a much smaller
population and tepid growth of about 3 percent, pales in
comparison to the four emerging market giants. 
 Its economy is less than a quarter of the size of Russia's,
which is the smallest in the original grouping. While it may be
the largest in Africa, it is only a bit bigger than China's
sixth-richest province.	
 
 South Africa lobbied China, its biggest trade partner and
one of the most influential states in southern Africa, for entry
into the grouping, seeing an invitation to the club as a way to
distinguish itself from the pack of second-tier emerging
economies. 
 ""It is a historic moment for South Africa,"" President Jacob
Zuma said on Wednesday when he arrived in China for the summit.	
 Jim O'Neill, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management
who coined the BRIC concept in 2001, has said South Africa does
not belong in the grouping, while others have suggested that
Indonesia, South Korea or Turkey, all with larger economies than
South Africa, would be a better fit. 
 But South Africa helps bridge ""South-South"" trade and expand
the grouping's influence as a counterbalance to the established
Group of Seven major economies that mostly represent North
America and Europe.	
 ""What the G7 was for the old world, BRICS is for the new and
to make it more representative, of course there has to be an
African economy there to speak for the developing world,"" said
Martyn Davies, a specialist on Africa-China economic relations
and chief executive of Frontier Advisory.	
 
 COMMODITIES	
 South Africa and southern Africa also offer the original
BRIC states something that they desperately need -- commodities
to feed their economic engines.	
 India, Brazil and China have been working hard to increase
trade with Africa. Brazil mining giant Vale plans to
invest $15-$20 billion within the next five years in Africa and
its oil company Petrobras plans to invest $3 billion
in Africa through 2013.	
 China forged partnerships with many African states decades
ago in their liberation struggles to end colonial rule and later
invested in roads, schools, power plants and infrastructure to
help the countries grow -- helping it import more minerals.	
 As Africa has grown, so has trade with China, which leapt to
$126.9 billion in 2010 from about $10 billion in 2000, China's
state news agency Xinhua reported.	
 But major BRIC fund managers appear not to have bought into
the idea that South Africa belongs in the grouping. None of them
has allocated significant assets from their portfolios into the
country after it was invited to join the grouping in December of
2010.	
 Andre Roux, the co-head of Fixed Income at Investec Asset
management, said South Africa is not of the same class of the
original BRIC states in terms of an investment opportunity.	
 ""What we are beginning to see is the evolution of an
emerging market block,"" Roux said, adding the group will
eventually include states such as Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico
and will seek common views on economic policy issues.	
 One advantage South Africa offers for the BRICS comes from
its strong links to the economies of the regional group SADC --
the Southern African Development Community -- which is made of
15 states with a total GDP of $471 billion and a population of
257 million.	
 It includes fast growing economies such as Angola, one of
Africa's biggest oil producers, Botswana, the world's biggest
diamond producer, Mozambique, home to some of the world's
largest untapped coal reserves and Zambia, the continent's
biggest copper producer. 
 ""South Africa's entry has definitely given the BRICS a voice
in the African continent,"" B.R. Deepak, a professor of Chinese
Studies at India's Doon University wrote in a note for the South
Asia Analysis Group.

 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.7 percent on the day at
121.95 yen, though it stayed well below an 11-month high of
123.33 yen hit on Monday.
 ""If there is no pullback in oil and other commodity prices
then I think going forward the yen will be very vulnerable,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.

 YEN FALLS
 The yen's downtrend was seen staying intact as long as risk
appetite holds up. The negative impact on the economy of the
recent massive earthquake was expected to ensure Japanese
monetary policy remains ultra-loose for a prolonged period.
 The Japanese government's downgrading of its assessment of
the economy for the first time in six months added weight to
this view.
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 84.08 yen after sliding
more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday for its biggest one-day
percentage drop in four months.
 Global equities and commodities recovered on Wednesday from
falls the previous day, when an upgrade of the severity of
Japan's nuclear crisis turned investors more risk-averse,
prompting them to unwind some of their recent yen-funded carry
trades.
 ""This selling-off has provided the opportunity to buy
USD/JPY but caution is advised as risk sentiment does remain
fragile,"" said a Tokyo-based trader, adding he saw a range of
83.00-86.00 yen.
 The dollar continued to be supported by its 200-day moving
average -- currently around 83.46 yen -- having bounced off that
level on Tuesday. More support lies at 83.34 yen, the 23.6
percent retracement of the dollar's mid-March to April rally,
and 83.30 yen, the dollar's March 11 intraday high.
 Short-term resistance lies at 84.33 yen, the conversion line
on the daily Ichimoku chart, a form of Japanese technical
analysis widely used among market players. Reported option
expiries at 83.20, 83.90, 84.00, 84.50 and 85.00 yen also
pointed to dollar/yen being trapped in a range.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.6 percent at $1.0501 to come
closer to its recent 29-year high of $1.0585. It was up more
than 1 percent versus the yen at 88.34 yen, regaining ground
after a 1.8 percent slide on Tuesday.

 * Deal on local-currency credit lines may be in works
(Adds account of trade ministers' meeting; changes dateline)	
 By Ray Colitt and Ben Blanchard	
 SANYA, China, April 13 (Reuters) - Trade ministers of the
five BRIC nations gave no sign on Wednesday of being ready to
make concessions to break a deadlock in decade-old talks to free
up global commerce.	
 The Doha Round of negotiations, being conducted under the
umbrella of the World Trade Organisation, has made little
progress since coming tantalisingly close to a breakthrough in
2008.	
 Among the main reasons for failure then were the refusal of
the United States and other rich countries to reduce farm
subsidies further, and the rejection by developing countries,
led by India, to increase Western access to their markets for
goods and services.	
 Meeting on the eve of a BRICS summit on the southern Chinese
island of Hainan, trade ministers from Brazil, Russia, India,
China and new member South Africa sounded pessimistic about the
prospects for the talks.	
 ""The delicate balance of trade-offs achieved over 10 years
of negotiations and contained in the draft July 2008 texts risks
being upset,"" the ministers said in a media statement.	
 Leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and developing economies
declared in November that there was a narrow window of
opportunity in 2011 to finish the round. A number of key WTO
members, including the United States and France, have elections
in 2012.	
The United States said last month that major emerging
economies had to muster the political courage to open their
markets. But, by endorsing the outline agreement drawn up in
2008, the BRICS suggested the onus was on the West to climb
down.	
 ""Ministers remain willing to conclude the round on the basis
of those draft modalities,"" they said in the draft statement.	
 
 COOPERATION	
 China's Ministry of Commerce said the meeting also called
for improved global coordination of economic policy to shore up
the world recovery and achieve robust, balanced growth.	
 The economic clout of the BRICS group is growing as the
developed world struggles to pare debt and the five are starting
to operate as a common bloc in the G20, providing a counterpoint
to the United States and other traditional powers.	
 The five BRICS countries accounted for just under 18 percent
of the world's $62 billion economy in 2010, though China's GDP
was bigger than the other four members put together.	
 As part of a drive to boost trade and investment among
themselves, leaders on Thursday are expected sign an agreement
to extend mutual credit lines denominated not in dollars but in
the BRICS' local currencies, according to India media reports.	
 ""For future growth and development, BRICS countries needs to
boost trade among each other,"" said Lin Yueqin, a researcher
with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.	
 Lin noted that trade between China and Russia, for example,
was below $60 billion a year, a fraction of the $200 billion in 
 trade between China and South Korea.	
 He said the caucus, which is holding just its third annual
summit, had a long way to go before it could match the Group of
Seven advanced economies.	
 ""The BRICS is more of a symbol for cooperation than a group
for joint action. But, as with everything, without a humble
start you can't have a great future,"" Lin said.

the right to vote down any supplementary contributions by the
country to a permanent fund being set up to bail out fiscally
troubled euro zone states, a document obtained by Reuter shows.
 The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is due to come into
force in 2013 with 80 billion euros in cash reserves meant to
assure a triple-A rating. Germany has agreed to pay 21.7 billion
of that.
 The fund will also be backed 620 billion euros of
guarantees, increasing the euro zone's potential firepower for
dealing with future financial crises and in effect committing
member states to additional contributions if required.
 But following a warning from Germany's Federal Court of
Auditors, members of the lower house's budget committee want any
supplementary payments into the ESM to face a parliamentary vote
instead of being made automatically.
 ""We expressly welcome the demand of the Federal Court of
Auditors for a more direct involvement of parliament and will
consult about this intensively when the ESM is installed,"" CDU
parliamentary budget expert Norbert Barthle told Reuters.
 Should the fund's capital base be threatened, and should a
contributing country be unable to pay its share, a simple
majority decision could require all others to top up their
contributions, according to the audit report.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Wednesday
after recent declines, and Wall Street looked set to open higher
with better-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan as a backdrop.
 European stocks gained more than 1 percent.
 Oil prices firmed as investors sought fresh opportunities to
bet on riskier assets.
 The Japanese yen fell after a brief show of strength in the
previous session. The government downgraded its assessment of
the economy for the first time in six months to reflect last
month's devastating earthquake and tsunami and their aftermath.
 Brent crude oil was above $121, halting a two-day decline,
on fears that the Libya conflict could settle into a bloody
stalemate, while a sudden disruption in Kuwaiti oil exports due
to bad weather boosted sentiment.
 Overall, Wednesday was mostly a mirror image of Tuesday,
reflecting investors' current tendency to be risk-on one day and
risk-off the next.
 Surveys suggest that investors are willing to take riskier
bets at the moment but are being constrained by concerns that
growth in the global economy and, possibly, corporate earnings
are vulnerable.
 ""The overriding theme at the moment is that the data we're
seeing simply isn't conducive to building much confidence in the
market,"" said Cameron Peacock, analyst at IG Markets.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
half a percent for a 4.5 percent year-to-date gain. Much of the
drive came from emerging markets <.MSCIEF>, which gained more
than two-thirds of a percent.
 Emerging markets have returned to favour in the past few
weeks after a hiatus.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.9 percent on the day in thin
volume. Analysts suggested the full impact of the country's
disasters, as outlined in the government's new assessment, was
still not clear.
 A Bank of America-Merrill Lynch fund manager poll on Tuesday
showed investors rapidly cutting their exposure to Japanese
equities, although some big firms have been buying.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 1.02 percent,
rebounding from its biggest one-day fall in a month on Tuesday.
 
 YEN WEAKER
The yen slipped broadly while the euro hit a new 15-month
high against the dollar at $1.4521 on EBS trading platform.
 The prospect of further interest rate rises by the European
Central Bank while monetary policy stays loose in the U.S. and
Japan continued to buoy the single currency.
 The dollar  was up 0.6 percent at 84.08 yen 
after sliding more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday for its biggest
one-day percentage drop in four months.
 ""If there is no pullback in oil and other commodity prices
then I think going forward the yen will be very vulnerable,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in

 On European bond markets, Bund futures handed back some of
the gains from a rally in the previous session.

 SYDNEY, April 13 (Reuters) - The rise of online shopping is
giving Australians a way to cash in on the strength of the local
dollar in a way that is helping restrain both inflation and
interest rates.	
 The ability to find and safely buy cheaper goods offshore
has broken the tyranny of distance that has long saddled
Australian shoppers with higher costs and opaque pricing.	
 ""The leakage of sales to the 'net is putting concerted
pressure on retailers to pass on savings from the dollar that
once they would have kept,"" said Michael Workman, a senior
economist at Commonwealth Bank.	
 ""This deflationary impact essentially means the Reserve Bank
has more time before it has to tighten again.""	
 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lifted interestrates
seven times between October 2009 and November last year but has
since been on hold, satisfied that it was ahead of the curve on
inflation. 
 Economists had thought it might move again as early as June
this year but the latest spurt in the dollar has led many to
push that out to August. The futures market is even more
relaxed, implying only a 50-50 chance of a move at all in 2011.	
 
 The local dollar, known colloquially as the Aussie, hit
29-year peaks on its U.S. counterpart last week and the highest
in over two years against the Japanese yen. 
 Measured against a basket of major currencies, the Aussie's
trade weighted index reached new heights this week, having
climbed no less than 46 percent since the dark days of the
global financial crisis in late 2008.	
 In the past, a rise in the Aussie had only a faint and
fleeting effect on inflation domestically, largely because
retailers here were never under pressure to pass on the savings,
choosing instead to fatten profit margins.	
 As a huge country with only a small population -- 22.5
million at last count -- consumers could not benefit from the
economies of scale that those in the United states or Europe
enjoy. Distance also allowed suppliers and retailers to treat
the country as a captive market, setting prices well above what
would be charged in, say, American shops.	
 But all that changed in recent months as brick and mortar
retailers found consumers were increasingly jumping ship to
online outlets offshore where their dollars were worth more.	
 Reliable data is scarce but the central bank thinks online
sales are thought to account for around 3 percent of Australia's
A$700 billion in household consumption, and are growing rapidly.	
 Facing a buyers' strike, retailers have been forced to pass
on savings from the high currency -- and the effect on the
consumer price index (CPI) has been dramatic. Of the 100,000
prices in the CPI survey, no less than 30 percent fell in the
last quarter of 2010. 
 
 HOW CHEAP?	
 A recent RBA survey of consumers found 80 percent of
respondents had made purchases online. The total value of
international purchases had been growing by an average 15
percent a year since 2005.	
 The temptation is understandable. Books and DVDs, for
instance, are routinely 30 to 70 percent cheaper abroad, even
after the cost of postage.	
 The current top-selling book on Amazon.uk, for instance,
costs A$6.20 at current exchange rates. In Australia, it goes
for A$23 online from one of the biggest book chains.	
 Scenting the potential, the UK arm of Amazon recently
stopped charging postage on the 11,000-mile trip to Australia
and New Zealand on all orders worth 25 pounds ($41) or more.	
 The writing was on the wall early this year when billionaire
retailing magnate Gerry Harvey joined a campaign to close a
loophole that allows Australians to buy up to A$1,000 of goods
online without having to pay the standard 10 percent goods tax.	
 The push drew an absolute deluge of criticism from consumers
deriding Australian retailers. So overwhelmingly negative was
the response that Harvey withdrew from the campaign, saying
getting involved had been ""suicidal"".	
 One newspaper poll on the controversy drew 35,500 replies
with 99 percent favouring online shopping. 
 One typical reply: ""My daughter likes Wrangler jeans for
horse riding. Here, if you can even find them, they are over
$100 a pair. She got online to the U.S. and got the jeans for
$30 a pair. She bought six pairs and had them here in a week.""	
 ""These days, I only go to the big retailers if I have to try
on some clothes for size or see a product in real life, before I
buy it online at one third of the price,"" was another.	
 Indeed, the retailers' campaign served only to let consumers
share their favourite sites.	
 One consumer promoted UK online retailer Wiggle
(www.wiggle.co.uk): ""The Brooks Glycerin runners I pay over $200
for here are $118 with free postage. Most of the customer
reviews on Wiggle products surprisingly were from Australians.""	
 
 A GIFT FOR THE RBA 
 Prices for audio, visual and computer gear fell over 18
percent last year as local retailers cut prices to deal with the
online threat, while sports equipment dropped 6 percent, major
household appliances almost 4 percent, men's clothing 4.8
percent and women's 6.3 percent.	
 Overall, prices for tradable goods which are dominated by
imports were up just 1.6 percent in the year, while those for
mostly domestically sourced services rose 3.4 percent.	
 That played a crucial part in bringing the annual pace of
underlying inflation down to a decade-low of 2.25 percent. It
looks like slowing even further this quarter to hit the very
bottom of the RBA's long-term target band of 2 to 3 percent.	
 That would be a major surprise as when the RBA last hiked
interest rates in November, it had thought core inflation would
go no lower than 2.5 percent.	
 Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS, calls the ascent of
the Aussie ""the gift that keeps on giving"" for the RBA. 
 ""The ongoing rise of the Australian dollar suggests near
zero 'goods' inflation in Australia over the rest of this year,""
he said. 
 ""Lower across-the-docks prices are more likely to find their
way to lower final consumer prices, so for now a high Australian
dollar is working hard for the RBA.""

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, April 13 (Reuters) - The yen slipped on Wednesday
as a bout of global risk reduction abated, with some market
players looking for fresh opportunities to put on bets against
the yen after having booked profits the previous day. 
 The yen fell against the dollar and dipped broadly on the
crosses, giving back some of the gains it made on Tuesday, when
it rallied broadly as short-covering gained steam. 
 Traders said a sell-off in global equities and commodities
coupled with an upgrade of the severity of Japan's nuclear
crisis had prompted investors to unwind some of the recent
one-way yen-funded carry trades, with extended positioning
having helped exacerbate the move.	
 ""I don't think anyone is serious about buying yen at this
stage. They are covering shorts. It's just a question of
reducing positions,"" said Rob Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas
in Singapore, referring to the yen's surge the previous day.	
 Indeed, the yen has quickly come back under pressure, with
the Australian dollar rising 1.2 percent to 88.26 yen
. The Aussie dollar regained some ground against the
yen after Tuesday's 1.8 percent slide, but still remained well
below a 2-1/2 year high just above 90 yen touched on Monday. 
 The yen has slid broadly over the past several weeks on
worries about the economic impact of a massive earthquake and
tsunami that hit northeast Japan on March 11, and on
strengthening market expectations that the Bank of Japan will
lag behind other central banks in raising interest rates.	
 Such expectations and subdued market volatility have helped
put the focus on the yen's appeal as a funding currency for
carry trades -- a tactic of selling low-yielding currencies to
fund investments in assets with higher yields.	
 The spike in risk reduction and position unwinding seen on
Tuesday across various markets seemed to lose momentum on
Wednesday, with MSCI's broad measure of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan rising 0.7 percent , clawing back
some ground after its 1.7 percent fall on Tuesday.	
 One event that could affect investor risk appetite is the
Monetary Authority of Singapore's policy decision on Thursday,
said Ryan of BNP Paribas.	
 Asian currencies could rise and support risk sentiment if
the MAS tightens monetary policy on Thursday, he said.	
 ""We get further risk-on, we get further intervention
recycling into euros and Aussie is likely to benefit as well.""	
 But Asian currencies may take a hit if the MAS holds off
from tightening monetary policy, Ryan said, adding that such an
outcome could cause investors to scale back expectations for
further currency appreciation in Asia.	
 ""I think there is the potential for investors to look at
Asia and say, 'Is this the beginning of the end of the
tightening cycle in Asia?',"" Ryan said.	
 Singapore is expected to tighten monetary policy on
Thursday, with the central bank either sanctioning a small,
immediate jump  in the local dollar or signalling it will let
the currency rise at a faster pace over time, a poll of
economists by Reuters showed.  [ID:nL3E7FD0HK] 
 
 DOLLAR SUPPORT NEAR Y83.50	
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent to 84.22 yen after having
slid more than 1.2 percent on Tuesday for its biggest one-day
percentage drop in four months.	
 The dollar bounced off support at its 200-day moving average
near 83.50 yen. More support lies at 83.34 yen, the 23.6 percent
retracement of the dollar's mid-March to April rally, and 83.30
yen, the dollar's March 11 intraday high. 
 Short-term resistance lies at 84.33 yen, the conversion line
on the daily Ichimoku chart, a form of Japanese technical
analysis widely used among market players. 
 ""After they booked profits yesterday, positions held by
market players who had taken bets against the yen earlier are
now pretty square,"" the customer dealer said. ""They are now
looking for the proper timing and catalyst to build yen-selling
positions again.""	
 The euro last stood at 122.00 yen , up 0.8 percent
from late U.S. trade on Tuesday but well below an 11-month high
of 123.33 yen hit on Monday. 
 The euro rose 0.l percent against the dollar to $1.4486
, having touched a 15-month high of $1.4520 on Tuesday on
trading platform EBS.

 * China will also participate in restructuring Spanish banks
 * Spain wants China to look at infrastructure investments
(Adds quotes, details)	
 BEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - China's promises to buy
Spanish government bonds and invest in the restructuring of
Spanish banks are valuable commitments that will shore up market
confidence in the euro zone state, Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on Wednesday.	
 Since the deepening of European debt woes last year, China
has repeatedly expressed optimism about the health of the
Spanish economy and the wider euro zone, backing up its talk
with large-scale purchases of European government bonds.	
 With Zapatero visiting Beijing, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
took the pledges a step further, saying that China would
continue to buy sovereign bonds and also participate in a fund
to restructure Spain's debt-riddled savings banks.	
 ""The two promises are very valuable. They will help promote
our stability, reform and market confidence, especially the
Spanish economic recovery, so I express my gratitude to the
Chinese government,"" Zapatero told a news conference, according
to the Chinese-language translation.	
 A Spanish government source told Reuters on Tuesday that Wen
did not mention specific investment amounts at the meeting with
Zapatero. China already held 12 percent of the Spanish sovereign
debt in foreign hands, the source said. [ID:nLDE73B1NI]	
 While vowing to support Spain, Chinese officials have also
made it clear that they remain concerned about fallout from
Europe's debt crisis.	
 In comments published on Tuesday, Vice Finance Minister Li
Yong warned that the troubles could spread beyond the euro
zone's periphery if underlying structural problems were not
properly addressed.	
 Asked whether Chinese officials had voiced such concerns in
bilateral meetings, Zapatero said he had delivered a reassuring
message.	
 ""What we have said to Chinese officials and investors is
that you should have confidence in Spain and such confidence is
coming from the understanding of our economic fundamentals,
fiscal capability, economic reform and our growth potential,"" he
said.	
 ""Analysts think that with Portugal asking for a bailout from
the EU, euro zone sovereign debt risks are almost coming to an
end, and this has been widely believed,"" he added.	
 Along with shoring up Chinese interest in Spanish bond
issues, Zapatero's trip was also intended to help drum up
business for Spanish firms.	
 Among the deals signed during the bilateral meetings were
memorandums of understanding for Spanish wind turbine maker
Gamesa to supply Chinese firms with 300 turbines for a
total power capacity of 600 megawatts.	
 Zapatero said he was also encouraging the Chinese to invest
in Spanish infrastructure, potentially including airports. Spain
wants to sell up to 49 percent of the loss-making airport group
AENA, worth a total of around 30 billion euros, as part of
efforts to reduce a massive public deficit.	
 ""We hope that we can attract private sector investment to
develop and manage these airports,"" he said.

 SINGAPORE, April 13 (Reuters)- - The yen weakened and
Asian stocks headed higher on Wednesday, with investors looking
for fresh opportunities to bet on risky assets after a sharp
drop in oil the previous day caused an unwinding of positions. 
 Crude oil priced edged up after falling about 3 percent

gained in Asia, suggesting the sudden shakeout in bets on
equities and higher-yielding currencies may have run its course.	
 The pullback in commodity prices had made investors cut
exposure to risky assets such as emerging market stocks and
currencies that have had steep gains recently such as the
Australian dollar.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.8 percent in choppy trade, with
technology-related shares leading the way higher. 
 Tokyo's Nikkei finished up 0.9 percent, with shares
of Tokyo Electric surging on heavy volume on a report
that its liabilities stemming from Japan's nuclear crisis may be
capped. Other utilities stocks slid since they may have to help
foot the bill. 
 U.S. stock futures rose 0.4 percent  after falling for
four consecutive sessions, suggesting a higher open on Wall
Street. 
 The yen slipped more than 0.6 percent against the dollar and
euro as some analysts said its gains this week were because of
stretched positioning and may be an opportunity for investors to
re-enter or extend their short positions. 
 ""I think the markets at the moment are just pausing to take
a bit of profit and assess things in the yen crosses,"" said
David Forrester, FX strategist at Barclays Capital in Singapore.

""We have to remember that over the past two weeks we have had
a big rush into yen-funded carry trades,"" Forrester said. 
 Brent crude for May , which expires on Thursday, rose
0.8 percent to $121.78 a barrel. U.S. May crude  added 0.4
percent to $106.68. 
 Gold bounced higher on Wednesday after posting its biggest
fall in a month in the previous session. Declines in bullion and
silver ETF holdings suggest investors are nervous following a
second bearish forecast from commodity bull Goldman Sachs.	
 Spot gold added more than $3 to $1,458.31 an ounce
after falling as low as $1,443.49 an ounce on Tuesday. Gold hit
a record around $1,476 an ounce on Monday on the prospect of
more declines in the dollar.	
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings slipped to 1,216.299
tonnes by April 12 from 1,217.209 tonnes on April 7. 
 U.S. Treasuries dipped as Asian investors took advantage of
their hefty gains overnight to offload some of their holdings,
but market players say prices could climb further if U.S. retail
sales data due later in the day shows inflation is crimping
consumer spending.

 * Yen, Swiss franc gain sharply as carry trade unwinds
 * Japan, U.S. equities slide buoy safe-haven bids
(Recasts; updates prices)
 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - The yen and Swiss franc
gained roughly 1 percent against the dollar on Tuesday amid
heightened risk aversion due to Japan's nuclear crisis and a
slide in U.S. stocks.
 The move into safe havens forced many to unwind carry
trades, strengthening the yen and also bolstering the Swiss
franc.
 Investors had been borrowing heavily in low-yielding
currencies such as the yen and using the funds to invest in
higher returning markets like the Australian dollar, a trend
that some said had become overstretched.
 ""The shakeout in risk positioning, after Japan upgraded its
nuclear emergency level, caught the market short of yen,"" said
Lena Komileva, global head of G10 strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.9 percent at 121.10,
recovering from a low of 120.16 yen touched earlier in the
day.
 The U.S. dollar fell 1.1 percent to 83.64 yen, near
technical support at its 200-day moving average just below
83.50.
 The yen rose for a fourth straight session against the
dollar, partly retracing 10 consecutive days of losses. The
Swiss franc also advanced for a fourth straight day against the
greenback.
 The dollar fell 1.1 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.89650. It earlier dropped to 0.89446, its lowest in more than
three weeks.
 Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical strategist at CitiFX in
New York, said carry trades looked ""overextended,"" especially
the yen crosses.
 ""These are the ones looking shaky,"" he said about
yen-funded carry trades.
 The session's initial sell-off in risk was prompted by
Japan's Nuclear Safety Agency raising the severity rating of
the Fukushima accident to level seven -- the highest
classification on the scale and the same as the world's worst
nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986.
 On Wall Street, meanwhile, U.S. stock indexes slid about 1
percent as oil prices sank and blue-chip aluminum maker Alcoa's
leaner-than-expected revenue started the earnings season on a
disappointing note.
 The euro was another big mover on Tuesday, rising above
$1.45 to a 15-month high against the dollar, boosted by reports
of buying from China and news the world's second largest
economy was willing to purchase more Spanish government debt.
 The dollar has tended to benefit from risk aversion, but
the growing perception that the U.S. Federal Reserve will lag
other global central banks in raising interest rates weighed on
the greenback.
 ""The greenback's inability to bounce today means that a
further weakness is a clear and present risk and a further
decline is possible in coming days,"" said Nick Bennenbroek,
head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
 Earlier the euro surged to $1.4518, its highest since
mid-January 2010, according to electronic trading platform EBS.
By late afternoon New York trade it had come off its peaks,
trading up 0.3 percent on the day at $1.4476.

 By Solarina Ho
 TORONTO, April 12 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar retreated
from 3-1/2 year highs on Tuesday as a basket of factors --
including concerns from the Bank of Canada over the ""persistent
strength"" of the currency, as well as slumping oil and equities
-- pressured the commodities-linked currency.
 The central bank, which held interest rates steady at 1
percent as expected, cautioned that the soaring Canadian dollar
-- which has been near highs not seen since November 2007 --
could create ""even greater headwinds for the Canadian
economy.""
 ""Equities were off, oil was off, a lot of the risk
currencies were coming under pressure, commodities were lower;
the floor got pulled out from those hoping for hikes in May,""
said Darcy Browne, managing director of capital markets trading
at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
 ""The Bank of Canada took some of the wind out of the sails
of the Canada bulls who were hoping for near-term interest rate
hikes ... This was a perfect storm for a little back-up in the
Canadian dollar today.""
 Adding to the pressure were crude prices that fell more
than 3 percent and sharply weaker global equity markets. The
Toronto Stock Exchange hit its lowest point in nearly four
weeks, as energy and mining shares were battered by a broad
commodities selloff. [ID:nL3E7FC04S] [ID:nN12257134]
 The currency  finished the session at C$0.9631 to
the U.S. dollar, or $1.0383, down from Monday's North American
finish of C$0.9565 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0455, which was
close to a 3-1/2 year high. This was the Canadian dollar's
weakest close in a week.
 ""To me, really, nothing has changed fundamentally in the
world. But on a one day, short-term trade, it was a healthy
correction,"" said Browne.
 The central bank reiterated comments made in its March 1
policy announcement, hinting that a May 31 interest rate hike
was unlikely. But it set the stage for rate increases later
this year by predicting inflation would hit its target six
months earlier than previously thought. [ID:nN12159489]
 Market focus now is on the Bank of Canada's monetary policy
report and news conference on Wednesday morning, with traders
set to parse any further comments on the strength of the
Canadian dollar.
 ""The market's caught between a rock and a hard place here,""
said Browne. ""They know the bank probably wants to hike, but
the bank just can't hike when the currency's so strong. Oddly
enough, they'll get their hike if the currency weakens.""
 BOND PRICES MOSTLY FIRM
 Money market rates and bond yields fell slightly after the
rate announcement as investors trimmed the likelihood of a rate
increase at the Bank of Canada's next policy announcement date
in May. Global factors were also in play.
 ""I think the general risk-off trend in global markets today
is the more dominant impact,"" said David Tulk, chief Canada
macro strategist at TD Securities.
 Overnight index swaps, which trade based on expectations
for the key central bank rate, now show just a 6.13 percent
chance of a rate hike on May 31, compared with 26.61 percent
before the statement.
 A September rate hike remains fully priced in by the market
with a 25 basis point rise seen. 
 In a Reuters poll of economists and strategists released
last week, however, the median forecast was for the bank to
make the first interest rate hike of the year on July 19.
[CA/POLL]
 The two-year bond , which is especially sensitive
to Bank of Canada policy moves, was up 14.5 Canadian cents to
yield 1.863 percent, while the 10-year bond  added
53 Canadian cents to yield 3.423 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices suffered their
biggest two-day loss in 11 months and stocks dropped on Tuesday
on concerns about the strength of global growth and as Goldman
Sachs warned crude was set for a pullback.
 The price of crude traded in New York slid more than 3
percent, bringing losses since Friday to 5.8 percent. Goldman
Sachs predicted Brent prices would fall back to $105 in ""coming
months,"" down from $120 on Tuesday, and the International
Energy Agency said high prices could be eroding demand.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI's main world equity
index <.MIWD00000PUS>, were down 1.3 percent, the index's
biggest one-day decline in four weeks.
 Worries over global growth were heightened after Japan's
economic minister warned that damage caused by last month's
earthquake and tsunami could be worse than initially thought
for the world's third-largest economy. [ID:nL3E7FC092]
 Japan's decision to put the severity of radiation leakage
at its stricken Fukushima nuclear plant on a par with the worst
nuclear disaster, at Chernobyl, also weighed on sentiment.
[ID:nL3E7FB2TZ]
 ""The market is increasingly becoming concerned about the
situation in Japan and that high oil prices and high commodity
prices will eventually hurt economic growth,"" said Mark Bronzo,
money manager at Security Global Investors in Irvington, New
York.
 U.S. stocks ended lower after disappointing revenue figures
from aluminum maker Alcoa Inc , the Dow component that
marked the start of the quarterly earnings season with its
release after the market close on Monday. Energy stocks led
losses on the benchmark S&P 500.
 The S&P energy index <.GSPE> , the market's top performer
in the first quarter, shed 3 percent.
 ""The leadership has been for the longest time in those

 SAFE-HAVEN DEMAND
 Safe-haven demand boosted Treasury prices. The benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 23/32, with the
yield at 3.498 percent. Thirty-year bonds  rose more
than a point in price, last yielding 4.579 percent.
 The yen and Swiss franc rose sharply as jittery investors

currencies.
 ""Carry trades are owned heavily and looked overextended,

said Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical strategist at CitiFX in
New York.
 The yen firmed to a 1-1/2-week high versus the U.S. dollar
, though gains are likely to be curbed by the Bank of
Japan's perceived determination to keep monetary policy loose
to aid economic recovery.
 The dollar fell 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc
 to 0.8957 francs. It earlier dropped to 0.89421, its
lowest in more than three weeks.
 The euro rose to a 15-month high against the dollar above
$1.45, boosted by reported buying from China and news that
China, the world's second-largest economy, was willing to
purchase more Spanish debt.
 Dovish comments from key U.S. Federal Reserve officials
weighed on dollar sentiment. Two of the Fed's most powerful
officials, Janet Yellen and William Dudley, said the U.S.
central bank should stick to its super-easy monetary policy as
inflation is not a threat and unemployment remains too high.

(Adds comments)
 MEXICO CITY, April 12 (Reuters) - Brazil's real slumped by
the most in three months and Mexico's peso sank on Tuesday as
investors sold riskier assets after a recent rally, but the
allure of the region's debt was seen containing losses.
 Fears of a worsening nuclear situation in Japan, a
commodities sell-off and a lackluster start to the U.S.
earnings season prompted investors to book profits on the big
rally in emerging market currencies.
 Both Brazil's real and Mexico's peso recently hit their
strongest levels since 2008, and analysts said investors would
likely soon snap up the currencies to pile on fresh bets on the
region's higher-yielding debt.
 ""This is a natural correction following a strong rally,""
said Diego Donadio, a currency and debt strategist at BNP
Paribas in Sao Paulo. ""We should be ready to restore bullish
positions in the near future.""
 Brazil's real  bid 0.76 percent weaker at 1.591 per
dollar, its worst one-day slide since January 14. Mexico's peso
 shed 0.68 percent to 11.83 per dollar, its steepest
one-day drop since March 16.
 Investors sold riskier assets like stocks and emerging
market currencies after Japan raised the severity rating of the
accident at its earthquake-crippled nuclear power plant, even
though it did not mean the situation had suddenly become more
critical. [ID:nL3E7FB2TZ]
 Also weighing on demand for the region's currencies, the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global commodities
benchmark, recorded its sharpest one-day decline in a month
from a sell-off in oil.
 Still, analysts said they did not see a shift in the
fundamental outlook for commodities, which are among Latin
America's top exports.
 ""We still see good demand from China and the U.S. recovery
is on track,"" Donadio said. China has become one of the world's
top commodities consumers. 
 U.S. stock indexes slid nearly 1 percent as oil prices sank
and aluminum company Alcoa's leaner-than-expected revenue
started the earnings season on a disappointing note.
 But demand for Latin American assets should rebound as long
as the United States is seen lagging the European Central
Bank's move last week to start hiking interest rates, analysts
said.
 Investors have been borrowing funds in low-yield currencies
such as the dollar to buy Latin America's higher-yielding
debt.
 ""There is ample liquidity and ample risk appetite, today
notwithstanding,"" said Win Thin, head of emerging markets
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""The
conditions that fed the rally (in emerging currencies) have not
changed.""
 Chile's peso  lost 0.36 percent to 473.70 per
dollar, hurt by the drop in prices for copper, its main
export.
 However, an expected 50-basis-point central bank interest
rate hike later on Tuesday is seen providing support for the
Chilean currency.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - The yen and Swiss franc
gained sharply on Tuesday on risk aversion partly brought on by
fears of a worsening nuclear situation in Japan, but the
sentiment may prove transitory given expectations investors'
appetite for higher-yielding currencies should return.
 Japan's ordeal, a commodities sell off, and a lackluster
start to the U.S. earnings season prompted investors to book
profits on carry trades, where investments in riskier assets
and higher-yielding currencies are funded by going short on the
low-yielding currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.
 ""The shakeout in risk positioning, after Japan upgraded its
nuclear emergency level caught the market short of yen, has
been quickly bought into, outlining resilient market attitudes
towards risk in line with our call,"" said Lena Komileva, global
head of G10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""Yet, the euro's rebound today has been about more than the
return of Japanese demand for euros above the 120 mark.""
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.8 percent at 121.24,
recovering from a low of 120.16 yen  hit earlier in
the day.
 ""Growth in carry trades are owned heavily and looked
overextended, especially the yen crosses. These are the ones
looking shaky,"" said Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical
strategist at CitiFX in New York.
 The initial sell-off in risk was prompted by Japan's
Nuclear Safety Agency raising the severity rating of the

the same as the world's worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in
1986. For details, see [ID:nL3E7FB2TZ]

 The euro was another big mover, rising to a fresh 15-month
high against the dollar above $1.45, boosted by reported buying
from China and news the world's second largest economy was
willing to purchase more Spanish debt.
 The euro's break above $1.45 was a bullish signal, which
could open a test of $1.4550 and $1.4580. Both levels are said
to be lined with option barriers.
 ""The greenback's inability to bounce today means that a
further weakness is a clear and present risk and a further
decline is possible in coming days,"" said Nick Bennenbroek,
head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
 Earlier the euro surged to $1.4518, its highest since
mid-January 2010, according to electronic trading platform EBS.
By afternoon New York trade it had come off its peaks, trading
up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.4484 .
 The China news also helped drive Spanish yields. Spanish
10-year yields have fallen to 5.18 percent on Tuesday from a
recent high of 5.55 percent on March 10.
 For the China news, click on [ID:nB9E7EN01X].
 Citi's Fitzpatrick thinks the euro could pull back a little
bit from $1.45.
 ""We do have come a long way for a very short period of
time. Maybe at this stage, we have gotten a little bit
overextended and we could go back to $1.40, but probably not
much lower,"" Fitzpatrick said.
 But he added that the overall positive bias on the euro
remained intact, and Citi's forecast is for the euro to rise
above $1.50 and settle at around $1.4850 by year-end.
 The U.S. dollar fell 1 percent to 83.76 yen , near
technical support at its 200-day moving average just below
83.50.
 The yen rose for a fourth straight session against the

Swiss franc also advanced for a fourth straight day against the

370,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 03:04PM ET</span>",Japan must do more to open markets to EU goods - EU," BRUSSELS, April 12 (Reuters) - Japan must prove it is
willing to open its markets to imports from the European Union
if it wants to launch talks for a free trade pact with the bloc,
Europe's top trade official said on Tuesday.
 Spurred by the country's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear
crisis, European Union leaders last month agreed to invite Japan
to negotiate closer trade ties with Europe, the world's biggest
market.
But for talks to start at an EU-Japan summit in late May,
Japan must first prove it is willing to dismantle rules that
slow European goods entering its market and block European firms
from bidding for big public works contracts, EU Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht told EU lawmakers.
 ""Starting negotiations without having a clear view of what
the level of ambition is, if there is really a preparedness to
do something about the non-tariff barriers I don't know if it
makes sense,"" De Gucht said.
 In particular, the European Union has composed a list of 27
Japanese rules -- from cumbersome liquor wholesale licence rules
to slow-moving approvals of EU food additives -- that it says
hampers EU exports and wants Japan to improve or remove.
 Japan has proposed solutions for three of these rules, De
Gucht said.
 ""We've told them they should make a considerable effort ...
They are working on the non-tariff barriers, but results up to
now are slow,"" he added.
 A traditional bastion of car and high-tech exports, Japan
has been defending its share of the European consumer market in
the face of ever stiffer competition from neighbouring economies
such as South Korea and China. 
 The near-completion of a trade accord between the EU and
South Korea has stoked Japanese fears of dwindling sales in
Europe, and prompted Japan last year to request a free trade
accord of its own.

 * China official warns of process as ""political tool""
 * G20 to also discuss commodities regulation, SDR role
 * Oil prices, capital flows also pushing way onto agenda
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, April 12 (Reuters) - The world's biggest economies
will struggle this week to make headway on a plan to identify
countries that put the global economy at risk with China
opposed to any attempt to curb its growth.
 Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 countries will try to
advance a complex plan for better balancing the world economy,
even as concerns about rising oil prices and surging capital
flows -- two immediate recovery threats -- crowd the agenda.
 Ahead of the G20 meeting on Friday, No. 2 economy China
warned it was not about to permit others to draw up a
""political tool"" for curbing its red-hot economic expansion by
trying to cap its hefty trade surpluses. For details see
[ID:nL3E7FC0B5].
 But the French hosts of the session, which occurs on the
sidelines of semiannual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, want to build on a hard-fought agreement
in February on indicators to use to measure global imbalances.
 The G20 agrees the world economy needs to be weaned from
U.S. spending and that more demand must come from trade surplus
nations, most notably China. But agreement on how to achieve
this better balance is proving difficult. [ID:nLDE71I02C]
 This time, French officials say the G20 should not only
agree on how to identify those causing imbalances but also
devise a way to red-flag those most responsible.
 ""We hope to reach a deal on the methodology this week,""
said a French source. ""We will demand more of the economies
which are systemic than the economies which are not.""

 IMF/G20 Take a Look [G7/G8]
 IMF/G20 Diary [IMF/DIARY]
 Text of Feb. 19 G20 communique [ID:nLDE71I0FN]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 NEW RISKS EMERGE
 But even as the G20 seeks consensus on how to lay a more
solid foundation for long-term expansion, oil prices near a
32-month high and the risk of out-of-control inflation and
asset bubbles in emerging markets all demand attention.
 France, the G20 chair this year, wants to make progress
toward a code of conduct setting conditions for the first time
for the use of controls to tame the type of hot money flows
that are threatening to destabilize many emerging markets.
 The IMF has agreed that capital controls can be useful at
times, but should be seen as a last resort. G20 members Brazil,
South Korea and Turkey have used them and are unlikely to bend
to curbs that would limit their ability to do so again.
 French officials also want to see movement toward rules for
curbing commodities price volatility, although officials said
there was no likelihood of an agreement in Washington on a
proposal to allow trading limits in commodities markets.
 The range of issues confronting its members complicates the
G20's effort to craft a road map for sustainable global growth.
France hopes a road map encompassing not only the indicators to
gauge imbalances but a means for applying them can be signed at
a summit in November.
 The G20 agreed in February on a list of external measures
like the trade balance and net investment flows and internal
ones like public debt and deficits and private savings rates to
use when trying to measure trade and other imbalances.
 But with big exporting nations and major commodities
producers resistant to imposing fixed numeric targets for the
indicators, officials said the guidelines will have to take
into account the specific structure of each member's economy.
 Officials would look at statistical data and use modeling
to analyze how agreed-upon indicators compare with historic
averages. Countries identified as having problems will pass to
a second stage of closer scrutiny, G20 officials say.
 PEER PRESSURE
 Some observers doubt whether major economies like China and
the United States can be obliged to take corrective action on
sensitive issues like their trade balances, but G20 officials
hope the public and collective nature of their assessments will
spur countries into action. A list of countries needing to take
measures is not likely until later in the year.
 In a communique on Friday, the G20 is expected to say the
recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis is intact despite
damage from Japan's earthquake and political instability in
North Africa and the Middle East, officials say.
 With recoveries strengthening and oil prices presenting an
inflation threat, some of the world's central banks have begun
to pull back on their economic supports.
 The European Central Bank raised interest rates on Thursday
and China's central bank has also been trying to temper
expansion. In contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve -- blamed by
emerging markets for spurring hot money flows -- is expected to
finish out a planned $600 billion bond-buying plan.
 Managing exits from supportive fiscal and monetary policies
is also likely to be a subject of discussion.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped sharply
for a second day on Tuesday, and helped drag stock prices down
around the world, after Goldman Sachs warned that crude prices
had gotten ahead of fundamentals and were set to fall.
 Oil traded in New York is down more than 7.0 percent in two
days as Goldman Sachs predicted Brent prices will fall back to
$105 in ""coming months"", down from $120 on Tuesday, and after
the International Energy Agency said high prices could be
eroding demand.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI's main world equity
index <.MIWD00000PUS> were last down 1.3 percent, the index's
biggest one-day decline in four weeks.
 Worries over global growth were heightened after Japan's
economic minister warned damage brought by last month's
earthquake and tsunami could be worse than initially thought
for the world's third largest economy. [ID:nL3E7FC092]
 Japan's move to put the severity of radiation leakage at
its stricken Fukushima nuclear plant on a par with the worst
nuclear disaster at Chernobyl also weighed on sentiment.
[ID:nL3E7FB2TZ]
 ""The market is increasingly becoming concerned about the
situation in Japan and that high oil prices and high commodity
prices will eventually hurt economic growth,"" said Mark Bronzo,
money manager at Security Global Investors in Irvington, New
York.
 U.S. stocks fell after disappointing revenue from aluminum
maker Alcoa Inc  started the earnings season late on
Monday.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was last down
107.32 points, or 0.87 percent, at 12,274.10. The Standard &

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
slipped 1.7 percent, with miners and energy firms among the
heaviest losers. Emerging markets <.MSCIEF>, which count
several resource exporters in their ranks, fell 1.9 percent.
 Brent crude oil  dropped $3.10 to $120.88 a barrel,
pulling back from Monday's 2-1/2 year high after a warning
about demand from the International Energy Agency

crude  lost $3.81 to 106.11 a barrel.
 Societe Generale also said rising gasoline prices in the

SocGen said.
 Spot gold  fell from Monday's record high while

 SAFE-HAVEN DEMAND
 The yen and Swiss franc rose as jittery investors sold
riskier trades funded by borrowing in the two low-yielding
currencies.
 ""Growth in carry trades are owned heavily and looked
overextended, especially the yen crosses. These are the ones
looking shaky,"" said Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical
strategist at CitiFX in New York.
 The yen firmed to a 1-1/2 week high versus the U.S. dollar
 though gains are likely to be curbed by the Bank of
Japan's perceived determination to keep monetary policy loose
to aid economic recovery.
 The dollar fell 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc
 to 0.8957. It earlier dropped to 0.89421, its lowest
in more than three weeks.
 The euro rose to a fresh 15-month high against the dollar

 JERUSALEM, April 12 (Reuters) - Israeli interest rates are
currently low and still have room to rise further since
inflation remains high, a senior Bank of Israel official said on
Tuesday.
 But financial markets should not try to determine a pattern
in the pace or size of each move, said Barry Topf, head of the
market operations division at the central bank.
 ""The human urge is for pattern recognition but it is simply
not useful in interpreting monetary policy,"" Topf said in an
interview with Reuters. ""Obviously, we don't want to take abrupt
steps but we want to take steps we feel are appropriate.""
 The Bank of Israel on March 28 boosted its benchmark rate by
a more than expected half-point to 3 percent for its third
straight monthly move and ninth since August 2009.
 Minutes of the decision showed a split among bank officials,
with two of the four lobbying for a quarter-point hike plus
further measures to cool the housing market. [ID:nLDE73A0U0]
 ""There could be macro-prudential steps in the future. We are
weighing them, considering them and formulating them but we
weigh and design lots of things that don't necessarily get
done,"" said Topf, who last week was named senior adviser on
monetary policy to Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer.
 Topf will also be a voting member of the new monetary policy
council currently being formulated. He defended the half-point
increase as necessary to maintain the Bank of Israel's
credibility in fighting inflation.
 ""The fact we raised rates 50 basis points was a surprise but
one has to look where the interest rate is at the moment. At 3
percent, they are still low and monetary policy is still
supportive of economic activity,"" he said, pointing to real
rates being zero to slightly negative.
 Annual inflation reached a 4.2 percent rate in February and
is forecast to have risen to a 28-month peak of 4.4 percent in
March. Inflation expectations published last month also
indicated inflation would stay near 4 percent for the next year
to stay above a government target of 1 to 3 percent.
 ""Inflation is currently higher than we like it to be,"" Topf
said. ""But we fully expect it to come down in the medium term,
which is what we are aiming for.""
 Inflation expectations ""have definitely gone down since the
last interest rate increase"", he said without elaborating.
 The Bank of Israel will next publish data on inflation
expectations for the coming years on April 21.
 Topf said the process of bringing rates to a more normal
level is a slow and gradual process and a function of economic
developments. Most analysts project another one-point of
tightening this year to 4 percent and reaching more than 5
percent in 2012. They peaked at 4.25 percent in 2008.
 ""The pace is not necessarily fixed,"" he said. ""We are
looking ahead and not just responding month by month to the
latest CPI figures but trying to see how they (rates) will
affect the economy down the road.""
 Rate moves, he said, impact housing prices in a lag of up to
a year. Housing prices have jumped over the past two years but
Topf said there were some signs the market is starting to cool.
However, ""there is an increase in worries about oil and
commodity prices.""
 The Bank of Israel's new six-member monetary policy council
is expected to start in the next few months and Topf expects
there to be a better degree of accountability and transparency
to the public. At present, the governor alone takes monetary
policy decisions.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 12:40PM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Bank of Israel eyes gradual end to forex intervention," By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, April 12 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel's exit
from foreign exchange market intervention will likely not be
abrupt and partly hinges on the pace of United States and
European interest rate increases, a senior central bank official
said on Tuesday.
 In an attempt to prevent a rapid appreciation of the shekel
and damage to exports -- which account for more than 40 percent
of economic activity -- the Bank of Israel has bought nearly $50
billion of foreign currency in the last three years.
 Barry Topf, head of the market operations division at the
central bank, said the policy has been a definitive success but
the bank seeks to stop being a player in the market.
 ""The exit strategy is a bit of a tango -- it's probably
dependent on what we do and also probably dependent on economic
developments globally,"" Topf said in an interview with Reuters.
 ""This is a very unusual process where interest rates are
zero or close to zero in major economies and major reserve
currencies. That will not last forever and hopefully they will
be able to move out of that soon and that will play a major role
in returning the whole system to a better balance,"" he said.
 After buying $10 billion in 2010, the central bank has so
far bought about $2.5 billion so far in 2011 -- $2.09 billion of
which came in January.
 Topf, who last week was named senior adviser on monetary
policy to Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer and who will
be a voting member of the new monetary policy council currently
being formulated, noted purchases in the first quarter were
below 2010 levels.
 ""It's not going to be an abrupt stop. We don't want to make
an abrupt stop,"" Topf said. ""What will probably be is the
realisation dawning on people that we are playing a smaller and
smaller and eventually no role in the market.
 ""We can't keep buying forever. So, it will have to return to
the state it was,"" he added.
 A key benefit of the purchases has been the ability of the
Bank of Israel to raise short-term interest rates without
worrying about the impact on the exchange rate, Topf said. The
central bank has raised its benchmark rate nine times by a total
of 2.5 percentage points to 3 percent since August 2009.
 
 FOREX RESERVES SOAR
 A main consideration for the intervention policy has been to
protect Israel's exporters. 
 ""We were able to bring the economy through the crisis
without forcing it to go through a wrenching readjustment to a
very overvalued exchange rate,"" Topf said.
 ""To expect exporters to find new markets in a contracting
market, to diversify geographically when markets are contracting
would have been an almost impossible feat and the real cost of
that would be very, very great,"" he said. ""Now, we are three
years later and exporters have held up profitably.""
 The dollar buying has brought Israel's foreign currency
reserves to $74.5 billion, a level Topf said was not excessive
and lower than many other countries. He said estimates of what
level of reserves are considered adequate have jumped as a
result of the global financial crisis.
 Topf declined to say what the central bank deems as an
acceptable level of reserves. He also dismissed criticism in the
Israeli media that the central bank is losing money on its
reserves, saying the losses mean the Israeli economy is doing
well and the public benefits from the economic growth.
 Still, Topf said the central bank was preparing the
groundwork to invest the reserves in equities to increase
profits.
 The shekel stands at a 2-1/2-year high of 3.44 per dollar.
Topf said the Bank of Israel doesn't just look at the
dollar-shekel rate but euro-shekel and other currencies in
high-growth countries Israel competes with for investment.
 While analysts have blamed part of the shekel's strength on
speculative flows, Topf said that was an imprecise term.
 ""What we have seen in the last few months is a greater role
for very short-term investments in the Israeli economy,"" he
said. ""Whether speculative or not speculative, they are
inherently more unstable and more risky because they are
short-term and can be reversed quickly and have the potential to
disrupt the economy. Once we saw this shift to shorter-term
investments ... we thought that was something that deserved a
response.""
 That came in January when it imposed a reserve requirement
on some foreign exchange derivative deals.
 Topf said the move has been effective and has changed the
trend ""and in some cases reversed the trend"".
 ""If we see the need to take more steps, we will,"" he said.
""It depends on the pace and extent of those flows.""

 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, April 12 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada laid the
groundwork to hike interest rates later this year by raising
its 2011 growth and inflation forecasts on Tuesday even as it
held policy steady and used less hawkish language than markets
expected.
 The central bank, as was widely forecast, held its key
overnight rate target at 1 percent. But its accompanying
statement knocked down the Canadian dollar and lowered market
expectations that it would lift rates in May.
 The Canadian economy will return to capacity six months
earlier than previously expected, by mid-2012, the bank said.
Likewise, it shortened the timeline for inflation to hit its 2
percent target, adding the rate would spike to 3 percent in the
second quarter of this year.
 But it made no signal it was likely to lift borrowing costs
at its next decision date on May 31, saying that any such move
would ""need to be carefully considered"" in a repeat of a phrase
it has used for the past several months.
 Tame inflation has allowed the bank to keep its key rate on
hold since last September following three consecutive
increases. Canada was the first Group of Seven country to
tighten policy following the financial crisis.
 In unusually strong language on the currency, the bank
warned that the strong Canadian dollar continued to be a
nuisance, hampering the export recovery and depressing prices.
 ""The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar could
create even greater headwinds for the Canadian economy, putting
additional downward pressure on inflation through
weaker-than-expected net exports and larger declines in import
prices,"" the bank said.
 As if to prove the point, Statistics Canada on Tuesday
reported a disappointing trade performance in February, with
exports falling 4.9 percent and the trade surplus declining to
a negligible C$33 million ($34 million). [ID:N12150409]
 All in all, the bank took pains on Tuesday to continue
sitting on the fence, while keeping alive expectations of a
July rate hike.
 ""There's nothing here to really suggest that the Bank of
Canada wants to take interest rates higher at the May meeting.
But certainly there's this idea that a July move is in play,""
said David Tulk, chief Canada macro strategist at TD
Securities.
 The Canadian dollar , which on Friday hit a 3-1/2
year high against the U.S. dollar, weakened to C$0.9614 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.0401, compared with C$0.9569 just before the
announcement.
 Swap markets showed investors see a 6.06 percent chance of
a May rate hike, down from 26.61 percent before the statement.
They were also pricing in a lower probability of rate hikes for
all subsequent 2011 decision dates. 
 Most analysts in a Reuters poll last week saw July 19 as
the most likely date for the central bank's next move.

 INFLATION, GROWTH AND THE LOONIE
 Unlike some other major economies, Canada has been
relatively immune to inflationary pressures from rising food
and energy costs. Core inflation hit its lowest level since
1985 in February, while the overall annual inflation rate was a
tame 2.2 percent. [ID:nN18184543]
 Growth began to heat up in the fourth quarter and early
2011, forcing the bank to raise its economic growth forecast
for this year to 2.9 percent from 2.4 percent. However, it cut
the outlook for next year to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent and
sees 2013 growth in line with potential growth at 2.1 percent.
 Fear of driving the Canadian dollar, known as the loonie,
to new heights may be motivating the central bank to be more
guarded than usual about its rate intentions, some analysts
said. If markets think an increase is coming, it could trigger
a rally in the currency to fresh multiyear highs.
 ""They run the risk of extrapolative expectation, so that
they move once and markets say, 'well that's just once in a
series of tightening' and they get there too fast, rates move
higher and the currency overshoots,"" said Craig Wright, chief
economist at RBC.
 ""It's going to be a cautious process towards normalizing
rates and it's going to take a couple of years rather than a
couple of quarters,"" he told Reuters in Calgary.
 More insight into the bank's thinking will be provided in
the quarterly monetary policy report, to be released on
Wednesday at 10:30 (1430 GMT), followed by a news conference by
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney.

 * China committed to buying Spanish debt, boosts euro

(Recasts, adds quote, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - The yen and Swiss franc
gained on Tuesday as Japan's nuclear situation worsened and
commodities sold off, prompting investors to unload risky
assets funded by the two low-yielding currencies.
 The strength in both the yen and Swiss franc was likely to
be short-lived. Demand for so-called carry trades financed by
those two units was expected to pick up again once investors
cash in on gains on these trades.
 The initial sell-off in risk was prompted by Japan's
Nuclear Safety Agency raising the severity rating of the
Fukushima accident to level 7 -- the highest classification and
the same as the world's worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in
1986..
 Oil prices dropped sharply for a second day, dragging
commodities and stocks lower, after Goldman Sachs called for a
fall of almost $20 in the price of Brent crude oil in the next
months.
 ""Growth in carry trades are owned heavily and looked
overextended, especially the yen crosses. These are the ones
looking shaky,"" said Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical
strategist at CitiFX in New York.
 The sell-off in commodities also had a negative impact on
risk sentiment in the currency market, other analysts said. The
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a global commodities benchmark,
fell about 1.9 percent on Tuesday in its sharpest one-day
decline in a month as raw materials markets came under pressure
from a sell-off in oil.
 The euro was another big mover, rising to a fresh 15-month
high against the dollar above $1.45, boosted by reported buying
from China and news the world's second largest economy was
willing to purchase more Spanish debt.
 The euro's break above $1.45 was a bullish signal, which
could open a test of $1.4550 and $1.4580. Both levels are said
to be lined with option barriers.
 In midday trading, the euro has come off its peaks, trading
0.2 percent on the day at $1.4455. Earlier, it surged to
$1.4518, the euro's highest since mid-January 2010, according
to electronic trading platform EBS.
 Investors took out option barriers at $1.4500 and stops at
$1.4510-12.
 The China news also helped drive Spanish yields. Spanish
10-year yields have fallen to 5.18 percent on Tuesday from a
recent high of 5.55 percent on March 10.
 Citi's Fitzpatrick thinks the euro could pull back a little
bit from $1.45.
 ""We have come a long way for a very short period of time.
Maybe at this stage, we have gotten a little bit overextended
and we could go back to $1.40, but probably not much lower,""
Fitzpatrick said.
 But he added that the overall positive bias on the euro
remained intact, and Citi's forecast is for the single euro
zone currency to rise above $1.50 and settle at around $1.4850
by year-end.
 The yen, meanwhile, rose for a fourth straight session
against the dollar, partly retracing 10 consecutive days of
losses. The Swiss franc also advanced for a fourth straight day
versus the greenback.
 The Japan radiation news led some speculators to book
profits on carry trades, where investments in riskier assets
and higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
are funded by going short on the low-yielding yen.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.9 percent at 121.15,
recovering from a low of 120.16 yen hit earlier in the day. The
Australian dollar also pared losses against the yen as did
other growth-linked currencies as investors bought at lower
levels.
 Short yen positions and key technical indicators in the
euro/yen and Aussie/yen pairs had been indicating the chances
of a temporary pullback after their recent rally. With this
correction, some analysts said, the trend for broad yen
weakness was likely to be on more solid ground.
 The U.S. dollar was down 0.9 percent at 83.79 yen , near
technical support at its 200-day moving average just below
83.50.
 Short-term losses in the dollar versus the yen are still
likely, with a close below 84.41-51 yen adding to the
greenback's bearish bias.
 The dollar fell 0.9 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.89830. It earlier dropped to 0.89446, its lowest in more than
three weeks.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 12:32PM ET</span>","""No reason to be optimistic"" on Doha trade deal-EU","BRUSSELS, April 12 (Reuters) - Deadlocked talks for a global
trade accord to free up trade flows and lift millions out of
poverty have reached a stalemate and there is little reason to
hope for a breakthrough, Europe's trade chief said on Tuesday.
Unwillingness by some of the world's leading traders to open
their markets to foreign manufactured goods has frustrated hopes
that the so-called Doha round could be revived after a
three-year lull and completed at the World Trade Organisation
this year, European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told
EU lawmakers.
 ""There is no reason to be optimistic at this moment in
time,"" he said. 
 ""Negotiations are now in an extremely difficult situation,""
De Gucht said while progress has been ""very disappointing""
particularly because of the reluctance of some countries to cut
import barriers on industrial products.
 In some of his most pessimistic public comments yet about
the Doha round of negotiations, De Gucht, who has been one of
the most active advocates of completing an accord, said it was
time to think of an alternative to a WTO accord.
 ""If not Doha, we will have to look if there is a Plan B. We
are already planning now to look at what should come next. ...
But we are now in the twilight zone. We don't know what will
happen,"" he said.
 Since global trade talks slowed in 2006 over disagreements
on market openings, the EU has pursued bilateral and regional
free trade agreements with the booming economies of South Korea,
India, South East Asia, Latin America and with Canada, as well
as freer trade with the United States.
 On Monday, the head of the 153-member WTO, Pascal Lamy,
triggered a race to rescue stalled global trade talks, setting
April 21 as a deadline for delivery of crucial ""texts"" that
could make or break the process by the end of April.
 The talks are almost a decade old. Failure to secure an
agreement this year could leave them in limbo as a number of key
WTO members enter election years in 2012.

 * To take into account circumstances of each economy

(Recasts, adds Chinese official, details)
 PARIS, April 12 (Reuters) - France hopes the G20 can reach
agreement this week on guidelines to identify global economic
imbalances, with the aim of bringing major economies in
particular under closer scrutiny, sources said on Tuesday.
 Friday's talks between G20 finance ministers in Washington
aim to build on a hard-fought agreement in Paris two months ago
in the face of Chinese resistance which laid out a list of
economic indicators that can be used to measure imbalances.
 These indicators include external measures like trade
balances and net investment income flows and domestic ones like
the public debt and deficit and private savings.
 The idea is to reach agreement on an action plan to be inked
in at the final November summit of France's G20 presidency, in
the resort of Cannes, to rebalance the world economy and set it
on track for balanced and sustainable growth.
 French government sources said this week's meeting in
Washington, on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank spring
meetings, would aim to agree on how to employ these indicators
in practice taking into account each country's circumstances.
 ""We hope to reach a deal on the methodology this week,"" said
one source, saying the guidelines would include a theoretical
aspect based on the type of economy involved and a statistical
element measuring the historic norms for each indicator.
 ""On the basis of this methodology we will examine in a
second phase the cause of the global imbalances,"" said the
source.
 The G20 will eventually aim to draw up a list of countries
or zones which are generating global imbalances, he added, but
suggested this was unlikely to take place during this week's
meeting.
 Those countries would then be subject to a second round of
more in-depth assessment, with major economies in particular
subject to strict criteria due to their importance for the
global economy as a whole.
 ""We will demand more of the economies which are systemic
than countries which are not systemic,"" he said.
 China, the world's second largest economy, fought hard in
February to win the exclusion of foreign reserves and exchange
rates from the list of indicators and appears likely to resist
further efforts to meddle in its economic affairs.
 Chinese Vice Finance Minister Li Yong said on Tuesday that
the concept of imposing a limit on its current account surplus
was a ""political tool"" of the United States and other developed
countries to try to restrain China's economic growth.

 * Foxconn to start assembling iPad in Brazil by end-Nov
 
 (Writes through, adds background and details)
 By Ray Colitt
 BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - iPhone maker Foxconn
Technology Group is considering investing $12 billion in Brazil
to assemble monitors, Brazil's president said on Tuesday, in a
sign the company may be ready to accelerate its move away from
its main China manufacturing base.
 The Brazilian government is studying Foxconn's investment
plan, President Dilma Rousseff told reporters during a visit to
Beijing, where she is meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao.
 ""You've got an ample range of investments that go from $300
to $400 million to $12 billion over 5 to 6 years in the case of
Foxconn,"" Rousseff said, speaking of discussions Brazil's
government is having with various technology companies.
 ""They're proposing a partnership. They came to us and said
we want to invest in Brazil.""
 A $12 billion investment would be the latest in a string of
moves by Foxconn to establish operations away from its main
manufacturing hub in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen,
where rising labour costs have forced many companies to set up
operations in cheaper parts of China.
 The company has traditionally manufactured most of Apple's
products at its Shenzhen factories.
 ""We've been talking to them for three months,"" said Aloizio
Mercadente, Brazil's science and technology minister. 
 The Brazilian government and Foxconn are negotiating a range
of details, including the location of any new facilities,
financing, taxes, broadband infrastructure and logistics,
including roads. 
 ""The negotiations are far from complete but I'm confident,""
said Mercadente.
 Calls to Foxconn's spokesman went unanswered. 
 Separately, Mercadente also told reporters that Foxconn is
planning to begin assembling Apple's iPad tablet PC at its
plants in the South American country by end-November.
 Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou has been ramping up the company's
capabilities in the LCD sector in recent years, setting up its
own flat panel display unit and buying Sony's LCD TV
manufacturing plant in Slovakia. The company's LCD unit is
Chimei Innolux.
 Foxconn, which counts Hon Hai and Foxconn International
Holdings as its subsidiaries, is a key supplier to top
technology brands such as Apple and Hewlett-Packard. These
brands typically do their own research and design work in-house
and outsource manufacturing to Foxconn and rivals such as
Flextronics.
 Besides Foxconn, other Taiwanese companies that operate
factories in Brazil include Compal, the world's No. 2 contract
laptop PC maker.
 Foxconn's last major investment outside of Shenzhen was in
October, when it announced a $2 billion plant in Chengdu, in
China's Sichuan province. The company has roughly 1 million
workers in China, and is the country's largest private sector
employer.

 By Randall Palmer
 OTTAWA, April 12 (Reuters) - Canada's export sector turned
in a disappointing performance in February, despite indications
that demand was rotating away from household and government
spending to exports and business investment.
 The country's trade surplus declined to a negligible C$33
million ($34 million) in February from C$382 million as a
decline in exports outstripped a fall in imports, Statistics
Canada said on Tuesday.
 Surging fourth-quarter exports had been the leading factor
in boosting growth for that quarter, but in February, exports
fell 4.9 percent to C$35.9 billion, primarily as the result of
lower energy and automotive sales.
 The decline in volume terms was 5.2 percent, and this is
important since it is reflected in inflation-adjusted gross
domestic product numbers.
 ""The theme of a rotation in the drivers of economic growth
away from domestic demand and towards net exports suffered a
slight setback due to today's weaker than expected trade,"" said
Mazen Issa, a macro strategist at TD Securities.
 A Statscan analyst said one factor behind lower auto
exports was that they were coming off an increase in January
that was due to the introduction of a new car model.
 Imports fell by 4.0 percent (4.3 percent in volume) to
C$35.8 billion, also on lower automotive and energy products.
 The Bank of Canada said on Tuesday that demand was indeed
rebalancing away from government and household spending, but it
said the Canadian dollar could weigh on exports.
 ""The improvement in net exports is expected to be further
restrained by ongoing competitiveness challenges, which have
been reinforced by the recent strength of the Canadian dollar,""
the bank said in its decision on Tuesday to keep its overnight
target rate steady at 1 percent.
 The median forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters was for
the trade surplus to rise to C$500 million from an originally
reported C$116 million in January. February's monthly decline
in the surplus was the second in a row. [ID:nN10113454]
 The trade surplus with the United States rose to C$4.6
billion from C$4.1 billion, while the deficit with the rest of
the world increased to C$4.5 billion from C$3.8 billion.
 Statistics Canada also said new housing prices rose by 0.4
percent in February from January. The last decline in housing
prices was registered in July 2010.
 Separately, real estate brokerage Royal LePage said the
strength in the housing sector had been fueled by low interest
rates and a recovering economy.
 In the first quarter, the average price of a detached
bungalow was up 4.3 percent at C$341,355 ($355,578), compared
with a year ago, a Royal LePage survey of more than 250
neighborhoods across the country showed.
 ""Canada's real estate market has maintained momentum coming
out of 2010, indicating that the post-recession recovery is
continuing,"" said Royal LePage Real Estate Services Chief
Executive Phil Soper.

2009 cable.	
 ""It just causes too many headaches and we'd never get
anything approved,"" the executive said.	
 Some of the resistance to U.S. acquisitions may lie in an
increase in patriotic sensibilities in China.	
 The cables show, for example, that a speech then U.S.
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson gave at the Shanghai Futures
Exchange in March 2007 didn't go down well with everyone in the
audience.	
 A top Shanghai financial department official, Fang Xinghai,
admonished Paulson for his assertion that he had never seen a
successful joint venture securities firm. This was seen as a
""direct attack"" on the Chinese model that had allowed Goldman
Sachs to set up the joint venture when Paulson was CEO of
the Wall Street firm.	
 In a meeting with the Shanghai consul general, Fang was also
reported as saying: ""Some Chinese officials questioned the tone
of Secretary Paulson's remarks, noting that he had spoken 'very
directly' and 'was telling us what to do.'""	
 ""It had caused some in the audience to react in a
'nationalistic' or defensive manner,"" Fang and Shanghai Futures
Exchange CEO Yang Maijun were reported in a cable as concluding.	
 Such nationalistic sentiments got a boost after the
financial crisis. Some financial services and private equity
executives cited in one Feb. 2010 cable from Hong Kong pointed
to ""China's rising assertiveness in light of the country's
continued growth and positive role in the global recovery.""	
 ""Although the U.S. still had considerable influence in the
region, security reviews that made it difficult for some
travelers to obtain U.S. visas and high profile CFIUS-related
cases had damaged America's reputation in Asia for openness,""
one executive said in the cable. ""Following the financial
crisis, Asians' tolerance for being lectured by the West had
markedly declined.""	
 Of course, not every deal gets shot down.	
 Late last year, state-owned China Huaneng Group Corp agreed
to buy a 50 percent stake in Burlington-based electric utility
InterGen for $1.2 billion in cash. CNOOC came back to
the United States in recent months as well with joint venture
investments in Chesapeake Energy Corp shale projects.	
 Last week, executives from CNOOC and Huawei were on a charm
offensive on the U.S. West Coast.	
 CNOOC Chairman Chengyu Fu said in Los Angeles the atmosphere
for foreign investments in the United States was welcoming and
it planned to make more through partnerships, while Huawei U.S.
division group chief technology officer Matt Bross said that
after the 3Leaf deal disappointment, more formal channels had
been created between the company and the U.S. government and
there was now ""a better understanding.""	
 But in many ways the picture in Washington may be
deteriorating.	
 Lawmakers on Capitol Hill indicated in a series of
interviews that they are far from feeling more receptive to
Chinese takeovers of anything remotely sensitive in terms of
military or technological value. And fears that China is
starting to pour its economic might into a more powerful
military is adding to the wariness.	
 ""The Chinese buildup of its military, particularly its naval
fleet, has made people more concerned about what China's
ultimate intentions are,"" said Republican Senator Susan Collins
when asked about the sensitivity of Chinese acquisitions. ""So, I
think there is a great deal of concern.""	
 Collins said she was particularly worried about inroads
China has made into the U.S. telecommunications industry based
on classified briefings she has received. Cyber attacks
emanating from China and seemingly aimed at the intellectual
property of U.S. companies were another concern, she said.	
 
 EVERY BUSH AND TREE	
 For Democratic Senator Jack Reed it is the close ties
between Chinese companies and the government in Beijing that
makes him suspicious.	
 ""The real concern -- and it has to be case by case -- is
that many of these companies are so closely intertwined with the
government of China that it is hard to see where the company
stops and the country begins, and vice versa,"" he said.	
 Such thinking doesn't go over well in Beijing. ""It's
excessive anxiety,"" said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a think tank
in China's Ministry of Commerce.	
 ""For the U.S., every bush and tree looks like an enemy
soldier,"" he said, adapting an old Chinese saying.	
 The next 18 months could be particularly rocky for Sino-U.S.
dealmaking, according to William Reinsch, president of the
National Foreign Trade Council, a business association focused
on international trade and investment issues.	
 The U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections are due in
November 2012. And in China towards the end of next year,
President Hu Jintao is expected to hand over the reins of power
to his heir-apparent Xi Jinping.	
 ""We could see a deterioration next year that is politically
motivated in both countries -- in that case I think you have a
potentially very serious problem,"" Reinsch said.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - Global fund managers cut their
exposure to Japanese equities sharply in early April, following
the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters, a Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch poll showed on Tuesday.
 But at least one leading fund, Threadneedle, has increased
its holdings.
BofA-Merrill's poll of 282 fund managers showed a net 18
percent now underweight compared with a net 8 percent overweight
a month ago.
 It calculates the numbers by subtracting those managers who
are underweight from those who are overweight, ignoring neutral
positions.
 ""Japan lost all of the positioning ... gains seen in the
past sixth months,"" the firm said, adding that exposure was now
at its lowest since November last year.
 The move is reflected in the performance of Japanese
equities. The broad TOPIX index is down nearly 8.4 percent from
where it closed on March 11 when the earthquake hit.
 But not all investors are walking away. Admitting that the
earthquake and following disaster had left it unable to forecast
Japanese growth with any certainty, Threadneedle said it was
moving overweight in the country's stocks.
 ""Clearly there will be a large, immediate hit to GDP in H1
(estimate -0.5%) but this will be followed by the rebuild,"" Mark
Burgess, chief investment officer, said in a note.
 ""If history is a guide, this will add strongly to growth
over the following 12-18 months.""
 Threadneedle has some 67.7 billion pounds ($110.1 billion)
in assets under management globally.
 Reuters asset allocation polls -- which survey investment
houses rather than fund managers, as BofA-Merrill do -- showed
that at the end of March, global investors had pretty much held
steady in their Japan allocations.
 Average allocations across the United States, Japan, Britain
and Europe ex UK, to Japanese equities only fell to 12.6 percent
from 12.7 percent of a global typical equity portfolio.
 Most of this fall was due to European investors. U.S. and UK
investors actually raised their allocations, while Japanese
investors themselves only cut back a small amount.
 In the 12 days since the Reuters polls were released, the
TOPIX has fallen roughly 3 percent.

$1.3 billion on unpaid debts is resolved, the Dutch finance
minister said on Tuesday.
 Jan Kees De Jager also said he wanted to lobby the
International Monetary Fund, which has been giving aid to
Iceland to help it recover from economic meltdown, to make sure
the money was repaid.
 In a referendum on Saturday, Icelanders rejected for a
second time a plan to repay a total of $5 billion to Britain and
the Netherlands in debts from a bank crash. [nLDE73900H]
 Both countries said they would take Iceland to court.
 ""A satisfactory solution of this problem needs to be in

Minister Jan Kees de Jager told parliament.
 ""We want to get the IMF aligned as much as possible to make

 In London, Iceland's President Olafur Grimsson said Britain
and the Netherlands likely did not need to go to court to
recover the $5 billion they could be repaid out of the bank's
estate.
 The debt was incurred when the two countries compensated
their nationals who lost savings in online Icesave accounts
owned by Landsbanki, one of three Icelandic banks that collapsed
in late 2008, triggering economic mayhem.
 The island of 320,000 people started membership talks with
the EU last year, but popular enthusiasm for the 27-nation bloc

 The government of Johanna Sigurdardottir has said a fresh
round of talks on further funding from the IMF would be delayed
several weeks due to the 'No' vote in the referendum.
 De Jager reiterated a solution to the debt problem was now
in the hands of the court of the EFTA Surveillance Authority
(ESA), the European trade body overseeing Iceland's cooperation
with the European Union.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a fresh
15-month high against the dollar above $1.45 on Tuesday,
boosted by reported buying from China and news the world's
second largest economy was willing to purchase more Spanish
debt.
 The euro's break above $1.45 was a bullish signal, which
could open a test of $1.4550 and $1.4580. Both levels are said
to be lined with option barriers.
 ""The euro is being supported by expectations of higher
interest rates and news that China has reiterated its
commitment to buy European debt,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief
currency strategist, at Scotia Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""That China news helped drive Spanish yields lower and was
positive for the euro.""
 Spanish 10-year yields have fallen to 5.18 percent on
Tuesday from a recent high of 5.55 percent on March 10.
 The yen and Swiss franc were the two other big movers of
the day, rising after Japan's nuclear situation worsened and
Alcoa missed revenue estimates, prompting investors to sell
risky assets funded by the two low-yielding currencies.
 Gains in both the yen and Swiss franc, were likely to be
short-lived as demand for so-called carry trades financed by
those two units may pick up again should the situation in Japan
improve.
 The yen rose for a fourth straight session, partly
retracing 10 consecutive days of losses versus the U.S. dollar.
The Swiss franc also advanced for a fourth straight day.
 The initial sell-off in risk was prompted by Japan's
Nuclear Safety Agency raising the severity rating of the
Fukushima accident to level 7 -- the highest classification and
the same as the world's worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in
1986..
 News that revenues from Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, missed Wall Street's target and leading to a
steep drop in the company's share price, also dented risk
sentiment.
 Both the Japan and Alcoa news led some speculators to book
profits on carry trades, where investments in riskier assets
and higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
are funded by going short on the low-yielding yen.
 In early New York trading, the euro reversed losses to
trade 0.5 percent higher on the day at $1.4510, after earlier
hitting a fresh 15-month peak at $1.4518 on electronic trading
platform EBS.
 Investors took out option barriers at $1.4500 and stops at
$1.4510-12.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.1 percent at 122.02,
recovering from a low of 120.16 yen hit earlier in the day. The
Australian dollar also pared losses against the yen as did
other growth-linked currencies as investors bought at lower
levels.
 Short yen positions and key technical indicators in the
euro/yen and Aussie/yen pairs had been indicating the chances
of a temporary pullback after their recent rally. With this
correction, some analysts said, the trend for broad yen
weakness was likely to be on more solid ground.
 The U.S. dollar was down 0.7 percent at 84.01 yen paring
earlier losses after running into technical support at its
200-day moving average just below 83.50. Japanese real-money
accounts were dollar/yen buyers, while offers were reported at
84.50.
 Short-term losses in the dollar versus the yen are still
likely, with a close below 84.41-51 yen adding to the
greenback's bearish bias.
 The dollar fell 1.3 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.89490. It earlier dropped to 0.89446, its lowest in more than
three weeks.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, which tracks the greenback
against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.5 percent at
74.754, after hitting 74.704, its lowest since December 2009.

 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, April 12 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada laid the
groundwork to hike interest rates later this year by raising
2011 growth and inflation forecasts on Tuesday even as it held
rates steady and used less hawkish language than markets
expected.
 The central bank, as was widely forecast, held its key
overnight target at 1 percent.
 The Canadian economy will return to capacity six months
earlier than previously expected, by mid-2012, it said in its
closely watched statement. Likewise, it shortened the timeline
for inflation to hit its 2 percent target by the same amount,
adding the rate would spike to 3 percent in the second quarter
of this year.
 But it made no signal it was likely to lift borrowing costs
at its next decision date on May 31, saying any such move would
""need to be carefully considered"" in a repeat of a phrase used
for the past several months.
 In unusually strong language on the currency, it warned
that the strong Canadian dollar continued to be a nuisance,
hampering the export recovery and depressing prices.
 ""The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar could
create even greater headwinds for the Canadian economy, putting
additional downward pressure on inflation through
weaker-than-expected net exports and larger declines in import
prices,"" the bank said.
 All in all, the bank took pains to continue sitting on the
fence while keeping alive market expectations of a July rate
hike.
 ""There's nothing here to really suggest that the Bank of
Canada wants to take interest rates higher at the May meeting.
But certainly there's this idea that a July move is in play,""
said David Tulk, chief Canada macro strategist at TD
Securities.
 The Canadian dollar  softened against its U.S.
counterpart shortly after the decision. It weakened to C$0.9608
to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0408, compared with C$0.9569 just
before the announcement.
 Overnight index swaps, which trade based on expectations
for the key central bank rate, showed investors see a 8.41
percent chance of a rate hike at the next meeting, down from
26.61 percent before the statement. They were also pricing in a
lower probability of rate hikes for all subsequent 2011
decision dates.

http://r.reuters.com/vad98r
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The bank warned higher energy prices and tax changes in
Canada would cause a short-term spike in inflation to 3 percent
in the second quarter of this year.
 The Canadian dollar, which finished on Monday near a 3-1/2
year high against the U.S. dollar, has generally helped curb
inflation and give the bank more breathing room to keep rates
low.
 Inflation pressures eased in February as the core rate,
which excludes gasoline and other volatile items, slipped to
0.9 percent year-on-year, the lowest since at least 1985. The
overall inflation rate was 2.2 percent annually.
 The bank raised its economic growth forecast for this year
to 2.9 percent from 2.4 percent, but cut its estimate for next
year to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent. It said the overall
growth profile was largely the same as it had anticipated in
January.
 ""They acknowledge that growth has been stronger than
expected, no surprise there. But they continue to cite the
serious challenges that the economy faces, and there's really
no significant change in the core inflation outlook,"" said Doug
Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 The central bank became the first in the G7 advanced
economies last year to tighten monetary policy following the
global financial crisis, raising its rates three times from
July-September but pausing since then due to the weak global
recovery.

 * Rising imports, M&A fan outflows
 * Tighter central bank policy may be a solution
 
 By Andrey Ostroukh and Lidia Kelly
 MOSCOW, April 12 (Reuters) - High oil prices have sent
foreign investors piling into Russia, yet the country is still
haemorrhaging billions of dollars in net capital outflows each
month -- because, it seems, more Russians are exporting cash.
 Uncertainty over who will be in favour after the 2012
presidential election seems to be prompting some businessmen to
shift cash out, companies are looking to expand abroad, while
households prefer to keep savings in euros.
 For the authorities, who have sworn not to introduce capital
controls, such flows are harder to pin down and stop than the
hot foreign money that flooded in and out of Russia in the past
decade. But monetary tightening may be an option.
 While prices for oil have soared to pre-crisis levels of
$120 per barrel, the world's top crude producer saw net capital
outflows of over $21 billion in each of the last two quarters.
 ""This is very surprising,"" said Sergei Guriev, dean of the
New Economics School in Moscow and a member of President Dmitry
Medvedev's council on modernisation.
 ""It could be related to the general political risk and
uncertainty about the forthcoming elections. The risk that the
new government will be even more anti-business scares Russian
businesses and professionals.""
 Ahead of next spring's presidential elections, there are
signs that Medvedev may be seeking to eclipse Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin as Russia's paramount leader.
 Analysts say businesses are afraid of shifts in the ruling
elite and its implications after the dismissal of Moscow's mayor
Yuri Luzhkov coincided with the start of outflows in 2010.
 Data appears to support that it is the Russians who are
responsible for the capital flight, while short-term foreign
investors are showing consistent interest.
 Russia-dedicated equity funds accumulated $3.6 billion in
the first quarter, up from $1.4 billion a year ago and compared
with outflows from Brazil, India and China, according to EPFR,
which monitors investment fund flows.
 POOR INVESTMENT CLIMATE
 Capital outflows are also driven by Russia's poor business
climate, with Sweden's retailer IKEA among those complaining
openly about corruption and excessive red tape.
 ""The general growth of corruption and deterioration of the
investment climate crossed a threshold where the Russian
business opportunities are no longer attractive,"" Guriev said.
 The Economy Ministry has cut its 2011 investment growth
forecast to 6 percent from 9 percent, while the World Bank
reckons that improving the investment climate should be the ""top
priority"" for Russia.
 ""If there were demand for investments in Russia, the money
would have been staying. Moreover, free funds are now being
invested (by Russians) into securities around the globe,"" said
Oleg Vyugin, board chairman at MDM bank, a top-15 lender.
 Telecoms group Vimpelcom bought a majority stake in Orascom
and Wind for $6 billion, while oil giant Rosneft sees expansion
abroad as a key growth area.
 After gaining almost 8.5 percent versus the dollar so far
this year and outperforming other BRICs, the rouble has made
foreign acquisitions cheaper.
 ""Outflows are likely linked to huge revenues from sales of
oil which do not always return to Russia -- if there is no need
for roubles why not to leave the money abroad?"" said Vyugin.
 
 CENTRAL BANK'S ROLE
 The stronger rouble is also boosting Russian imports, which
jumped nearly 46 percent year-on-year in the first quarter.
 In addition, it encourages companies to use currency swaps
to convert their borrowings into dollars and thus save on debt
costs while creating another source for capital outflows.
 Such schemes are facilitated by ample rouble liquidity,
supported in part by central bank interventions. In the first
quarter it bought $10.8 billion, injecting cash into the system
with overnight rates already at pre-crisis lows.
 ""Excess liquidity and 'smarter' corporates is a formula for
further capital outflows,"" analysts at Nordea said in a note,
adding that tighter monetary policy could reverse this trend.
 Outflows are set to hurt the current account and the rouble,
and later in 2011 the central bank may be eventually prompted to
hike deposit rates more actively, said Alexander Morozov, chief
economist for Russia and CIS with HSBC.
 ""Capital outflows remain a structural problem linked to the
investment climate, with the corruption factor playing a role,""
Morozov said.

Chinese airlines
(Adds detail about possible Foxconn deal)	
 By Ray Colitt	
 BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma
Rousseff did not press complaints about China's yuan currency
with her Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao on Tuesday, but came away
from a summit with wider market access and investment pledges
that may ease trade friction.	
 Rousseff also brandished a potential investment of $12
billion by Taiwan's Foxconn , the maker of Apple Inc's
iPhone and a vast range of other electronic goods.	
 Brazilian manufacturers have complained that China's yuan is
held so low it is damaging their competitiveness, giving Chinese
manufacturers an unfair advantage, which along with an
appreciating real has helped fuel rising Chinese exports
to Brazil.	
 But despite earlier signalling she would, Rousseff did not
discuss the currency dispute with Hu in their formal meeting in
Beijing, Brazil's Minister for Industry and Trade, Fernando
Pimentel, told reporters.	
 ""No, it was not (discussed),"" was Pimentel's brief response
to questions about whether the yuan issue came up in the summit.	
 That will be a victory of sorts for China, which has
resisted international pressure to raise sharply the value of
the yuan. But Rousseff did manage to clinch a series of business
deals on the first full day of her China visit.	
 
 Pimentel said that, as well as an order for 35 mid-sized
commercial jets manufactured by Embraer
announced earlier in the day, Chinese companies signed
investment deals for projects in Brazil worth $1 billion.	
 Rousseff said her government was talking with several
electronics manufacturers about investing in Brazil; they
included Taiwan's giant Foxconn, which has based much of its
production in mainland China.	
 ""You've got an ample range of investments that go from
$300-$400mln to $12 billion over 5-6 years in the case of
Foxconn,"" she told reporters of those discussions.	
 ""They're proposing to us a partnership. They came to us and
said we want to invest in Brazil,"" she said of Foxconn, adding
that the company may build computer displays in her country.	
 Brazil's Science and Technology Minister Aloizio Mercadante
said Foxconn and Apple could start making Apple's iPad in Brazil
by as soon as late November.	
 Rousseff said earlier in the day that bilateral trade
relations with China needed a qualitative boost to be
sustainable.	
 ""Brazilian exports to China are still excessively
concentrated in iron ore, soybeans, oil and paper pulp. That's
good but not sufficient,"" Rousseff told a business conference.	
 ""It's important to diversify for our trade to remain
sustainable. The key to this relationship is reciprocity in the
treatment of investments on both sides,"" Rousseff said.	
 A joint declaration from the summit also failed to mention
the currency, and made little progress in obtaining Chinese
support for a permanent seat for Brazil on the United Nations
Security Council. In it China said only it backed Brazil's
""aspirations for a more prominent role in the United Nations"".

 LOPSIDED RELATIONSHIP	
 Rousseff's five-day visit to China, which started on
Tuesday, is intended to gain more concessions in what many
Brazilians consider a lopsided trade and investment relationship
between Latin America's and Asia's largest economies.	
 Brazil particularly wants to gain more market access and
investments from China for value-added products. Last year 83
percent of its exports were raw material, while 98 percent of
its imports from China were manufactured products.	
 One of the top deals Rousseff will have to show for at home
is an order from Chinese airlines, including China Southern
, for the Embraer jets, each of which is valued at
around $40 million, the company's CEO Frederico Curado said at
the sidelines of a business seminar in Beijing.	
 Separately, Embraer's joint venture in China, Harbin
Aircraft Ltd, obtained a permit from Chinese authorities to
assemble the company's commercial jet, the Legacy 600.	
 Since she took office on Jan. 1, Rousseff has adopted a more
pragmatic, results-driven foreign policy than her predecessor
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who often ignored differences with
other developing nations to forge a common front against the
United States and Europe.	
 Other deals announced during Rousseff's visit include
research and development centres in the states of Goias and Sao
Paulo, each worth $300 million.	
 Brazil's meat packer Marfrig is investing $250 million in
six distribution centres in China.	
 Brazil's oil giant Petrobras signed technology
transfer agreements with Sinopec and Sinochem
to develop Brazil's vast, new off-shore reserves and
increase output at mature oil fields, respectively.	
 Rousseff is set to meet other Chinese officials on Wednesday
before heading to the southern island of Hainan for a summit on
Thursday of the BRICS nations that also include Russia, India
and new member South Africa.

more than expected in March to post their largest increase in
more than 1-1/2 years, driven by a surge in imported petroleum
costs and higher food prices, a government report showed on
Tuesday.
 Overall import prices jumped 2.7 percent, a sixth straight
month of gains, the Labor Department said. The increase
outstripped economists' forecasts for a 2.2 percent increase
and followed a 1.4 percent rise in February.
But excluding volatile petroleum and food prices, import
prices were up only a fractional 0.3 percent after rising 0.6
percent the prior month. In the 12 months to March, overall
import prices surged 9.7 percent, the largest increase since
April.
 The monthly rise in import prices reflected a 10.5 percent
surge in petroleum, the biggest increase since June 2009, which
followed a rise of 4.0 percent in February. Imported food
prices increased 4.2 percent, the largest advance since July
1994, after rising 0.7 percent in February.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 08:36AM ET</span>",US trade gap falls in Feb as trade contracts," WASHINGTON, April 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit
shrank in February as imports fell more than exports, according
to a government report on Tuesday that suggested a slowdown in
global demand.
The monthly trade gap totaled $45.8 billion, down from an
upwardly revised estimate of $47.0 billion in January. Analysts
surveyed before the report had expected the deficit to narrow
to $44.5 billion, from the previously reported January tally of
$46.3 billion.
 U.S. exports, after rising in each of the previous five
months, fell 1.4 percent in February to $165.1 billion. That
was led by a $1 billion drop in auto and auto parts exports,
with smaller declines for other major categories. Services
exports rose just enough to set a record.
U.S. imports, which like U.S exports have roared back from
the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009,
fell a larger 1.7 percent in February to $210.9 billion.
Automotive imports fell $2.3 billion, followed by a $2.1
billion drop in capital goods. Imports of consumer goods rose
$2.3 billion in February.
 The average price for imported oil rose for the fifth
straight month in February to $87.17 per barrel, the highest
since October 2008. But that was tempered by the lowest
quantity of crude oil imports since February 1999.
 The closely watched U.S. trade deficit with China shrank 19
percent in February to $18.8 billion, as U.S. imports from that
country fell and U.S. exports to the Asian manufacturing giant
rose.
 While Beijing could point to the smaller trade gap as a
sign its economy was becoming less reliant on exports, the U.S
trade deficit with China was still 21 percent higher for the
first two months of the year.
 China's own trade figures released earlier this week showed
that in the first quarter of 2011 it ran an overall trade
deficit for the first time since 2004.

404,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 08:32AM ET</span>","Investors more upbeat on stocks, less on economy-BofA poll"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - Investors pumped up their
exposure to stocks in early April despite some concern that
global growth will tail off, a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
poll showed on Tuesday.
 The investment bank's monthly survey of 282 fund managers
found a net 50 percent to be overweight in equities compared
with a net 45 percent in March.
 Cash holdings dropped to a net 10 percent overweight
compared with 14 percent a month earlier. Bonds continued to be
unpopular with a net 58 percent underweight, albeit a slight
improvement from March's 59 percent.
 The growing risk appetite reflected by these numbers,
however, comes against a backdrop of easing expectations about
the global economy.
 Although still above the long-term average reading, the
survey's growth expectations composite -- essentially the view
on global growth -- dropped to 62 from 66 in March.
 ""As much as global investors are struggling with the growth
outlook ... they see very little alternative to equities,"" said
Gary Baker, BofA-Merrill's head of European equity strategy.
 Such bullishness was also reflected among hedge funds, which
reported a 1:49 ratio of capital to gross assets, compared with
March's 1:33 ratio.
 This essentially means that hedge funds are becoming more
optimistic and increasing their leverage, BofA-Merrill said.
 Much of the reason for optimism is the continued loose
monetary policy of central banks, most notably the U.S. Federal
Reserve.
 A net 51 percent of respondents said monetary policy was
actually too stimulative.
 Baker said that not buying risk against this ""monetary
backstop"" was too tough to fight.
 
 JAPAN SLIDES
 Regionally, the fund managers sharply cut back on their
exposure to Japanese equities in early April, following the
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters.
The poll showed a net 18 percent now underweight compared
with a net 8 percent overweight a month ago.
 Instead, they returned to emerging markets robustly, lifting
exposure to a net 22 percent overweight fron neutral a month
earlier.
 The United States remained the most favoured region at 30
percent overweight, with Europe at neutral.

 By David Milliken and Peter Griffiths
 LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - British inflation eased in
March for the first time since last summer as grocers cut food
prices, reducing the chance of a Bank of England rate hike in
May and giving it leeway to support the still shaky economy.
 The unexpected drop in annual inflation to 4.0 percent from
4.4 percent in February -- together with a sharp decline in
retail sales -- gives ammunition to those policymakers who want
to see the economy on a solid footing before tackling inflation.
 Sterling fell and gilt futures extended an earlier rally
that had been driven by speculation about a soft inflation
number.
 ""It should help to stave off a rate rise in May,"" said
Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec. ""But while this is
welcome, this is just one battle in what will be a long tussle.
It's still possible inflation will rise to 5 percent over the
course of the year.""
 Economists at BNP Paribas pushed back their call for a first
BoE rate increase from May to August, in line with markets which
assign a probability of some 80 percent to an August move.
 Last week, the BoE opted to hold rates at a record low of
0.5 percent, breaking step with the European Central Bank which
raised rates for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
 The British government is hoping that rates can stay low as
its spending cuts -- launched to reduce the large public deficit
-- have yet to take full effect.
 ""The Bank of England has kept its nerve and they deserve
credit for that,"" Britain's Business Secretary Vince Cable told
Sky News. ""They've kept interest rates low and that's what the
economy needs.""
 Britain's Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was
investigating rumours that the 4.0 percent CPI figure had been
circulating in the markets before the official data release.
 Before the data was released at 0830 GMT, short sterling
interest rate futures rose, with traders pointing to market talk
that the rate would be well below economists' forecasts.
[ID:nLAK002769]
 
 HIGH STREET WOES
 The fall in the CPI rate last month was aided by a
non-seasonally adjusted 1.4 percent month-on-month drop in the
cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks, which the ONS said was
driven by supermarket discounting.
 The BoE faces a dilemma as it tries to tame inflation --
still at twice its 2 percent target -- without derailing a
fragile recovery after the economy contracted late last year.
[ID:nL9E7FB000]
 Britain's high street is suffering from a poisonous mix of a
rising cost of living, higher taxes and downbeat consumer
morale, and business leaders urged the BoE to stay away from
raising borrowing costs too soon.
 The British Retail Consortium said total sales, a measure
which includes new floorspace, fell by 1.9 percent in March ,
the worst drop since the BRC began collecting the data in 1995.
Like-for-like sales were 3.5 percent lower on the year.
 ""This is strong evidence of the pressure customers and
traders are under,"" said BRC Director General Stephen Robertson.
""Uncomfortably high inflation and low wage growth have produced
the first year-on-year fall in disposable incomes for 30 years.""
 The trade body urged policymakers to delay raising rates,
saying a hike ""would do more harm than good"".
 Companies such as Dixons , Britain's biggest
electricals retailer, electricals group Kesa , carpet
seller Carpetright  and car parts retailer Halfords
 have warned about the tough outlook.
 
 GROWTH
 The sales slump came on top of a recent surprise drop in
industrial production and a weak rebound in construction in
February, casting doubts about the strength of the recovery.
 Consumer price inflation has been above the Bank of
England's 2 percent target since December 2009, driven higher by
a mix of a weak exchange rate, rising commodity prices and two
successive annual increases in sales tax.
 But economists say the majority of policymakers who voted
for steady rates in past months would want to see a strong
economic rebound before tightening policy.
 ""We suggest a GDP figure of around 1 percent
quarter-on-quarter and PMIs in excess of 55 would be required to
get a majority in favour of a very modest hike,"" ING analyst
James Knightley said.
 In some good news for the economy, separate ONS data showed
that Britain's trade deficit for goods and services fell to its
smallest level since February 2010. That suggests net trade will
provide a bigger contribution to first-quarter GDP figures due
on April 27.
 The ONS said Britain's total global trade deficit fell to
2.443 billion pounds ($4 billion) in February from 3.858 billion
pounds in January, driven by an unexpected fall in the deficit
for goods.
 Manufacturers have reported stronger exports for several
months, but this has been slow to show up in official data.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 08:20AM ET</span>","INTERVIEW-Norway sees ""much higher"" oil price, exploration push"," * Energy minister expects demand for oil to outpace supplies
 * To boost exploration off Norway, open more of Barents Sea
 * Big Skrugard oil find may attract majors back to Norway
 
 By Wojciech Moskwa
 OSLO, April 12 (Reuters) - Norway's new Petroleum and Energy
Minister Ola Borten Moe said he expects the oil price to move
much higher as economic growth-driven demand outpaces supplies.
 Non-OPEC Norway, the world's No. 5 oil exporter and No. 2 in
natural gas, will seek to steady markets by increasing
exploration activity offshore Norway and quickly opening up a
new Barents Sea region for oil and gas activity, Moe said.
 Crude prices have surged by a third in 2011 to $125 per
barrel amid upheaval in the Arab world, potentially threatening
a fragile global economic recovery.
 ""It is my belief that there will be higher demand for energy
than supply due to increased economic activity and more people,""
Moe told Reuters Insider in an interview.
 ""And that is good news (for exporter Norway) and may also be
good news for the oil price... In the future we will see much
higher (oil price) levels than we are used to.""
Moe said advances in technology have allowed Norway, whose
oil era started in 1970, to maintain production longer than
envisaged and in some cases increase it.
 ""In our best fields we only have the technology to explore
about 50 percent of the (reservoir). So there are large amounts
of oil and gas that are theoretically possible to explore,"" said
Moe, 34, who took over as energy minister in March.
 Norway's oil output has nonetheless dropped by some 40
percent since 2000 as North Sea fields mature and most new finds
turn out to be small, leaving oil majors to look elsewhere for
growth and operators increasingly focused on extracting gas.
 
 MAJOR ATTRACTION
 Moe said that Statoil's Skrugard discovery in the Barents
Sea last month, Norway's biggest find in a decade that may hold
up to 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, could once again
put Norway on the majors' radar screens.
 ""I hope that it will make the area more attractive for new
companies,"" Moe said. ""We need several companies that can
contribute to development and... new technologies in Norway. In
that picture, it is important to have the majors' presence in
Norway.""
 The Skrugard find also bodes well for foreign interest once
Norway allows oil activity in a separate Barents Sea region that
was delineated in a treaty with Russia last year and, according
to communist-era studies, may be rich with oil and gas.
 ""I am very optimistic -- there might be even bigger fish in
the ocean,"" Moe said of the untapped region.
 Norway's turn to natural gas has come at a time when new
technology has boosted supplies of unconvential gas worldwide
and weakened gas prices in Norway's biggest market -- Europe.
 Trying to twin Norway's role as a top fossil fuel provider
with its image as a leader in the global fight to curb
emissions, Moe said that if Europe replaced all its coal-burning
power plants with gas-powered ones it would meet
emissions-reduction goals.
 ""It is clean and it is cheap and from our perspective... gas
has a future,"" Moe said.

 By Neal Armstrong and Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - The yen snapped a losing streak
on Tuesday as investors trimmed earlier bearish bets and booked
profits, although gains appeared likely to be shortlived with
demand for yen-funded carry trades set to pick up again.
 The euro  reversed losses to trade 0.2 percent higher
on the day at $1.4458, with offers said to be around $1.4485 --
just below the currency's 15-month high of $1.4489 -- and option
barriers reported at $1.4500.
 Against the yen, the euro was down only 0.2 percent at
121.94, recovering from a low of 120.16 yen  hit
earlier in the day. The Australian dollar also pared losses
against the yen  as did other growth-linked currencies
as investors bought at lower levels.
 ""The sell-off in risk looked overdone at its worst,"" said
Adam Cole, Global Head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets,
noting that the Aussie/yen pair was down only around 40 points
from Monday's U.S. close, having plunged 200 points in Asia to
around 86.80 yen.
 The initial sell-off in risk was prompted by Japan's Nuclear
Safety Agency raising the severity rating of the Fukushima
accident to level 7 -- the highest classification and the same
as the world's worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986.
[ID:nL3E7FB2TZ]
 The news led some speculators to book profits on carry
trades, where investments in riskier assets and higher-yielding
currencies such as the Australian dollar are funded by going
short on the low-yielding yen.
 Short yen positions and key technical indicators in the
euro/yen and Aussie/yen pairs had been indicating the chances of
a temporary pullback after their recent rally. With this
correction, some analysts said, the trend for broad yen weakness
was likely to be on more solid ground.
 ""The broader trend for increased risk should remain as the
market focuses on leading indicators,"" said Chris Walker,
currency strategist at UBS. ""If U.S. sentiment continues to
improve and risk appetite is stable this will keep carry trades
going.""
 Group of Seven (G7) intervention on March 18 to weaken the
Japanese currency has fuelled yen selling to fund carry
positions. Expectations the Bank of Japan will keep policy loose
to help the economy rebound from last month's devastating
earthquake have also hit the yen.
 The U.S. dollar was down 0.3 percent at 84.30 yen 
paring earlier losses after running into technical support at
its 200-day moving average just below 83.50. Japanese real-money
accounts were dollar/yen buyers, while offers were reported at
84.50.
 
 STERLING FALLS, BANK OF CANADA AWAITED
 The dollar index <.DXY >, which tracks the greenback against
a basket of major currencies, was down slightly at 74.971, near
a 16-month low of 74.838 hit on Friday.
 Dovish comments from key U.S. Federal Reserve officials the
previous day indicated the Fed is not in any hurry to tighten
policy, likely limiting the greenback's upside potential in the
near future. [ID:nN11296347]
 Sterling fell to a five-month low versus the euro
 and a one-week trough of $1.6227 against the dollar
 after annual inflation came in at 4 percent versus 4.4
percent forecast. [ID:nAHLBFE7FK]
 Expectations for a rate rise from the Bank of England were
pushed back to October.  In contrast, markets are
closer to pricing in a further rise in the European Central
Bank's main refinancing rate in June. 
 The euro was also helped by China's pledge to carry on
buying Spanish debt and help fund a restructuring of the
country's savings banks. [nLDE73B12SRM]
 The Canadian dollar  was lower against the U.S.
dollar ahead of a rate decision by the Bank of Canada. It is
widely expected to keep rates on hold. [ID:nN07149592]
 Societe Generale said in a note that Tuesday's pullback in
risk had created an ideal opportunity to go long on the Canadian
dollar/yen trade .
 It said it had entered a long spot position with stop losses
at 85 yen and targeting 92 yen, up from around 87.90 now. The
bank expects the Canadian dollar to strengthen on the back of
continued investment expenditure and rising employment.

 * German economy ""seems panic-proof"" to mkt -analyst
 
 MANNHEIM, Germany, April 12 (Reuters) - German analyst and
investor morale fell more than forecast in April as unease about
inflation and unrest abroad weighed, a poll showed, but a strong
domestic backdrop means the country's economic prospects remain
healthy.
 The Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank said on Tuesday
its sentiment index fell to 7.6 from 14.1 in March, the second
monthly decline running and far below a consensus forecast of
11.0 in a Reuters poll of 41 analysts conducted last week.
 The index was based on a survey of 291 analysts and
investors and conducted between March 28 and April 11, ZEW said.
 ""Considerable risks may result from increasing commodity
prices. These price increases could lead to second-round effects
that could then force the European Central Bank to adopt a more
restrictive monetary policy,"" ZEW President Wolfgang Franz said
in a statement.
 Any slowdown in Europe's largest economy could put
additional pressure on fragile peripheral euro zone countries
like Portugal, which are hoping nascent German private
consumption can provide some demand to stimulate their ailing
markets.
 But robust domestic demand and a falling unemployment rate
should ensure German output continues to grow at a solid rate,
analysts said.
""Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Africa,
and the disastrous events in Japan have cast doubt on the
sustainability of the German recovery,"" said Carsten Brzeski at
ING. 
 ""So far, these doubts remain unjustified. At least in the
eyes of market analysts and investors, the German economy seems
to be panic-proof.""
 A separate gauge on current conditions rose to 87.1, the
highest since July 2007 and confounding expectations for it to
fall to 85.2 from 85.4 in March.
 That suggested very strong growth over the first three
months of 2011, while a slowdown in the spring and summer would
not be a major problem, said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg
Bank, who continues to forecast GDP growth of 2.8 percent over
the whole year.
 The ZEW was pulled lower last month for the first time since
October, reflecting investor concerns over interest rate hikes
by a European Central Bank wrestling with inflationary
pressures.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet surprised markets at the
start of March by signalling an imminent tightening in monetary
policy earlier than had been expected, and carried through on
his warning last week when he raised rates by 25 basis points.
[ID:nLDE7351QH]
 But while the ZEW was quick to indicate a drop-off in German
growth, other monthly surveys like the Markit purchasing manager
indices (PMIs) and the closely watched Ifo-index have shown
little sign of an abrupt softening in economic activity.
 At the weekend, Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said the
German economy was continuing to grow strongly with domestic
demand gathering pace and there was no danger of high inflation
on the horizon. [ID:nLDE73908V]
 On Monday, French, German and Italian statistics and
economics institutes jointly forecast the euro zone's economy
would grow 0.5 percent in the first quarter and 0.4 percent in

 By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - Global share prices fell on
Tuesday and commodity prices traded off record peaks after fresh
concerns about inflation and Japan's nuclear crisis fuelled a
debate about the strength of the economic recovery.
 Retreating commodity prices helped send MSCI's main world
equity index down 0.7 percent, on track for its biggest one-day
fall in four weeks.
 The failure of U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa Inc to meet
analysts' revenue forecasts was a focal point for investor
uncertainty over first quarter earnings.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares slipped
1.2 percent, with miners and energy firms among the heaviest
losers. Emerging markets, which count several resource exporters
in their ranks, fell 1.3 percent.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Brent crude firmed 0.7 percent but remained off Monday's
2-1/2 year high after slipping on a broader bout of
profit-taking that knocked commodity prices.
 The sell-off was triggered in part by a report from
long-term commodity bull Goldman Sachs warning that oil and
other raw material prices could retreat after strong recent
gains. 
 Spot gold fell from Monday's record high while silver sagged
from the previous session's 31-year high.
 Anxiety over global growth outlook was fuelled by the
International Energy Agency, which warned that high oil prices
could erode demand.
 Societe Generale said rising gasoline prices in the U.S.
were fuelling a debate about ""demand destruction"" in the world's
top economy. ""Geopolitics (are) still critical. But with prices
high, markets may be having doubts on demand,"" SocGen said.
 
 YEN UP
 Concerns over global growth were heightened after Japan's
economic minister warned that the economic damage wrought by
last month's earthquake and tsunami could be worse than
initially thought.
Japan's move to put the severity of radiation leakage at its
stricken Fukushima nuclear plant on a par with the worst nuclear
disaster at Chernobyl also weighed on sentiment.
Heightened risk aversion prompted investors to unwind some
carry trade positions using the Japanese yen as a low interest
rate currency to buy higher yielding assets.
 ""Our positioning data shows some carry trades are pretty
extended,"" said Chris Walker, currency strategist at UBS.
 The yen firmed to a 1-1/2 week high versus the dollar but
gains are likely to be curbed by the Bank of Japan's perceived
determination to keep monetary policy loose to aid economic
recovery.
 Still, the steadier yen offered the dollar some respite,
allowing the greenback to stay above Friday's 16-month lows
against a basket of major currencies.
 Dovish comments from key U.S. Federal Reserve officials are
likely to cap the greenback's gains.
 Two of the Fed's most powerful officials, Janet Yellen and
William Dudley, said the U.S. central bank should stick to its
super-easy monetary policy as inflation was not a threat and
unemployment remains too high. 
 Diverging monetary policy direction among the world's major
central banks is likely to remain an investment theme in the
coming months -- and a below-forecast UK inflation reading in
March knocked sterling to a 5-1/2 month low against the euro.
 Heightened risk aversion nudged German Bunds higher with the
June Bund future up 36 ticks.
 Emerging sovereign spreads widened 3 basis points to trade
at 251 bps over U.S. Treasuries.

 BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - China downplayed trade
problems with fellow emerging giant Brazil on Tuesday, saying
any challenges were limited and could be resolved through talks.	
 ""The problems in China-Brazil trade and economic relations
are limited and part of a phase,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hong Lei told reporters at a regular news briefing, adding that
disputes could be solved through ""bilateral consultation on an
equal and friendly basis"".	
 Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff began a five-day visit to
China on Tuesday to push for more trade, a trip on which Hong
said China was placing great importance.	
 ""We're confident that this visit will certainly bring to a
new level the healthy relations that already exist between China
and Brazil,"" Hong said, noting that bilateral trade had grown
20-fold in the past decade, making China Brazil's largest trade
partner.	
 Rousseff's visit, in tandem with a large delegation of
executives and officials, bore early fruit on Tuesday after
China placed $1.4 billion in orders for 35 jets from Brazilian
aircraft maker Embraer SA . [ID:nL3E7FC0E4]	
 But Rousseff has faced complaints at home from manufacturers
and officials, who say China's cheap yuan currency is
undercutting domestic production and that China is soaking up
Brazil's commodities such as iron ore, but not buying
value-added products. 
 The Brazil-China Business Council has said raw materials
account for three-quarters of Brazil's exports to China and that
nearly 90 percent of Chinese investments in Brazil targeted
natural resource sectors. Nearly half of Brazil's manufacturers
say they have lost market share to China at home.

(Adds quotes)	
 By Kevin Yao	
 BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - The Philippines central bank
is ready to do more to tame inflation as it faces upward
pressures from soaring oil and commodity prices, its governor
said on Tuesday.	
 ""We continue to monitor the (inflation) situation and we are
prepared to take additional action if necessary,"" Tetangco told
Reuters in an interview in Beijing.	
 The remarks from the central bank chief will encourage
speculation that the central bank could raise interest rates by
another 25 basis points to 4.5 percent as soon as next month.	
 The bank holds its next policy meeting on May 5.	
 ""We want to be pre-emptive,"" said Tetangco, who is in China
courting investors to the Philippines. ""We recognise there are
some upside risks to inflation, particularly from commodity, oil
and food prices.""	
 Inflation in the Philippines ran at an annual pace of 4.3
percent in March, within the central bank's target range of
between 3-5 percent.	
 But given buoyant commodity prices, the central bank expects
inflation to break through its 5 percent target in coming months
before tapering off towards the end of the year.	
 ""We are committed to maintaining inflation at a manageable
level, and also manage inflation expectations,"" Tetangco said. 
 ""Prices are still well-behaved, but given the risks from oil
prices, we need to ensure that we are able to address any second
round effects at an appropriate time,"" he said.	
 Tentangco's hawkish remarks echo those from Finance
Secretary Cesar Purisima. 
 Also in Beijing for a visit, Purisima told Reuters that the
government was closely monitoring inflation and that a firm peso
will help to curb imported price pressures.	
 Philippine officials are trying to attract Chinese investors
in the country's infrastructure and industries including mining
and power.	
 Tegangco said Asian central banks should consider investing
part of their foreign exchange reserves in yuan-denominated
assets.	
 ""The possible investment in renminbi (yuan) assets is an
option,"" he said.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, April 12 (Reuters) - The yen rose sharply on Tuesday
and was the biggest gainer among major currencies over the past
24 hours as profit-taking on bets against it gathered momentum
after Japanese authorities upgraded the nuclear crisis to a par
with Chernobyl and several strong aftershocks hit Japan.
 Declines in oil prices also prompted investors to exit
positions in commodity-linked currencies.
 The U.S. dollar, like the yen, found some reprieve as
speculators locked in profits from positions taken against the
low-yielding currency in favour of the euro and red-hot
commodity plays such as the Australian dollar.
 Traders said both the yen and the dollar will likely resume
sliding, however, after the profit-taking has run its course.
 ""When there are uncertainties, you just close your
positions. At the moment, what a lot of people have is yen
short positions so the yen is being bought back. But I don't
see any change in the yen's downtrend,"" said a trader at a U.S.
bank.
 The yen had been sliding after the Group of Seven (G7)
countries sold the currency in last month's rare joint
intervention -- their first in more than a decade.
 Expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep policy loose
to help the economy rebound from last month's devastating
earthquake and tsunami, even as other central banks tighten to
avert inflation, also had made many market players comfortable
selling the yen, since higher yielding currencies tend to be
favoured by investors in the long run.
 As speculators bought back the yen, especially against
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and
the euro, the yen gained about 1.0 percent against the dollar,
about 1.2 percent against the euro and 1.6 percent against the
Australian dollar.
 The U.S. dollar fell to 83.80 yen per dollar , off a
seven-month high of 85.54 set on Thursday. It has managed to
bounce near its 200-day moving average at 83.51 yen, although a
break of that could pave the way for a test of 81.98 yen, a
38.2 percent retracement of its rise from a record low set last
month.
 The euro slipped to 120.80 yen , down from
Monday's peak of 123.33. The Australian dollar eased to 87.50
yen , having scaled a high of 90.02, its strongest
since September 2008, hit on Monday.
 ""Aftershocks in Japan hampered overall risk sentiment,
helping JPY to be the top performer overnight, even amid
reports that the estimate of the severity of the Fukushima
accident could be increased,"" said David Watt, strategist at
RBC.
 Japan raised the severity of its nuclear disaster to the
highest level on Tuesday, citing accumulated levels of
radiation released. [ID:nL3E7FB2TZ]
 The U.S. dollar had the upper hand against other
currencies, gaining 0.6 percent against the Aussie, 0.5 percent
against the Canadian dollar and 0.2 percent against the euro.
 EYEING INFLATION
 The dollar index <.DXY >, which tracks the greenback
against a basket of major currencies, posted a slim gain to
stand at 75.111, having found support after plumbing a 16-month
low of 74.838 on Friday.
The euro  retreated from Friday's 15-month high around
$1.4485 to $1.4400, but traders say the January 2010 high of
$1.4582 remains in play.
 The Australian dollar  fell to $1.0433, off a
29-year peak of $1.0585 set Friday. The Canadian dollar dropped
to C$0.9600 per U.S. dollar , compared with a 3 1/2-year
high of C$0.9526 hit last week.
 But dovish comments from key U.S. Federal Reserve officials
the previous day indicate that the U.S. Federal Reserve is not
in any hurry to tighten its policy, likely limiting the
greenback's upside potential in the near future.
 Two of the Fed's most powerful officials, Janet Yellen and
William Dudley, said on Monday that the U.S. central bank
should stick to its super-easy monetary policy, arguing that
inflation is not a threat and unemployment remains too high.
[ID:nN11296347]
""With the Fed's accommodative policy intact for some time,
USD weakness is likely to persist. Thus, the small correction
seen across the board indicates more profit-taking than the
start of a trend,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note.
Many traders also expect the yen to stay under pressure from
low yields, after the knee-jerk reaction to the aftershocks has
passed.
Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchange at State Street
Global Markets in Tokyo, said the yen's fall in the past month
had been largely driven by speculators as many institutional
investors typically need some time to assess their strategies
after a big incident.
 ""We've seen unexpected factors such as Libya and the
disaster in Japan. At a time like this, when there were sudden
big changes, it is speculators and not investors who can
quickly move,"" Tomita said.
 ""Foreign investors have bought Japanese shares for many
years. If they start selling them, that could push down the yen
further,"" Tomita added.
 But Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp, said the yen could gain further against a broadly
weak dollar if the G7 finance ministers' meeting shows a gap
between Japan and other G7 partners on the G7 commitment to
yen.
 ""Japan wants continued commitment to the yen but other G7
countries may want to limit joint intervention to a one-day
event. If that picture is brought home to market players, the
yen could test 80 yen,"" says Uno, one of the most
dollar-bearish analysts.
 Markets are next eyeing inflation data, with Germany, Spain
and the United Kingdom among those releasing reports on
Tuesday. U.S inflation data is due on Thursday and Friday.
In Britain, the annual consumer price inflation rate is
forecast to hold steady at a 28-month high of 4.4 percent, more
than double the central bank's target. 
Another upside surprise would fuel talk of an imminent rate
hike, giving sterling a fillip. The pound was down 0.3 percent
at $1.6284 , having reached a 15-month high of $1.6430
on Friday.

is set to rebound in the third quarter after a sharp downturn
driven by overcapacity and limited demand, senior industry
executives said on Tuesday.	
 Container freight rates on the benchmark Asia-European route
tumbled by about half in the last nine months, trading last week
at around $978 per twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEUs) from more
than $1,800 in July 2010.	
 Seasonal demand, surging bunker fuel prices and tight
container box availability should help push rates higher and
help ease the ""sense of panic among carriers"", said Eng Aik
Meng, president of APL, the world's sixth largest container firm
and a unit of Neptune Orient Lines .	
 APL's rivals also agreed that freight rates could not linger
much longer at current levels, especially with bunker fuel
prices at multi-year highs.	
 ""I am optimistic on the second half. The availability of
containers, the cost of fuels and liners looking for ways to
reduce their consumption will cause a slowdown in transport
times,"" said John Lines, chief executive of ANL Container Line,
at an industry conference in Singapore.	
 ""These in many ways will balance the oversupply in
capacity.""	
 Bunker fuel prices , which can make up anywhere
from 10 to 70 percent of operating costs depending on the type
of vessel, climbed to 2-1/2 year highs this week.	
 Shipping companies have adjusted their contracts with
clients and introduced additional fuel surcharges to ensure
operating costs do not dip below earnings.	
 ""I don't think any liners today can afford this type of
rates at these high costs,"" said S.S. Teo, managing director of
Pacific International Lines.

(Adds byline, bullet points)	
 By Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - China's growing global
economic footprint was on display on Tuesday, with a Greek
minister saying Beijing will help his country overcome its debt
crisis and a Brazilian official brandishing a big jet order from
Chinese airlines.	
 A parade of foreign leaders are in China this week to attend
a summit of BRICS countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa -- and the Boao business forum on the southern
Chinese island of Hainan.	
 Even before those get underway, a series of important
bilateral meetings were set for Tuesday with Brazilian President
Dilma Rousseff, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero and Greek Investment Minister Harris Pamboukis all in
Beijing.	
 The visits revealed the divergent paths of nations in the
wake of the global financial crisis and China's surge to
prominence as a partner and a competitor.	
 Brazil has been a major beneficiary of China's voracious
appetite for commodities, but its manufacturers have grown
alarmed at a wave of Chinese imports.	
 That will likely be on Rousseff's mind when she pushes
Beijing to buy more value-added goods from Brazil instead of
just soaking up its commodities, whilst gently broaching the
subject of an undervalued yuan. [ID:nN07149192].	
 
 In a deal that looked to be aimed at countering some of
those worries among Brazilian manufacturers, Chinese airlines
placed orders for 35 jets from Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer
SA on Tuesday. [ID:nB9E7F100C]	
 On the other side of the ledger are countries like Spain and
Greece, beset by a mountain of debt, who have turned to China as
a potential buyer of government bonds.	
 Those hopes were underscored by Greek Investment Minister
Pamboukis in an interview with China's 21st Century Business
Herald newspaper, published on Tuesday.	
 ""(China's) purchase of Greek bonds will help our economy
overcome the crisis and regain the confidence of the
international market,"" he said, according to a Chinese-language
transcript. ""It will also help the stability of the euro zone. A
stable euro zone will also help the stability of the Chinese
economy.""	
 He said Greece would open its transport, tourism,
telecommunications and banking sectors to Chinese investors.	
 But China is no reluctant white knight. With an estimated
one quarter of its $2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves
invested in the euro , China is loath to see the euro zone
and its currency fail.	
 As such, China has repeatedly pledged its support and
confidence in Europe's ability to pull through the crisis, going
so far as to say it had already bought Greek and Spanish debt
and would buy more if need be.	
 Beijing has never disclosed its holdings or planned
purchases.	
 In October, Premier Wen Jiabao said China had already bought
Greek bonds and was preparing to buy more when Athens restarted
fundraising. 
 Media reports in Spain and Portugal that said China was
prepared to buy between 4-6 billion euros of debt from each of
the European countries were never confirmed by Beijing.

(Add details, quotes, background)	
 BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - A U.S.-proposed target to
limit countries' current account imbalances is a ""political
tool"" aimed at containing China's economic growth, China Vice
Finance Minister Li Yong said on Tuesday.	
 In what is China's fiercest rebuttal so far to the U.S.
proposal to limit countries' current account deficits or
surpluses to below 4 percent of gross domestic product, Li said
such curbs overlook the ""right"" of nations to develop and grow.	
 The remarks underscore the difficulties that finance
ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) nations face when they meet
on April 15 to discuss how to rebalance the global economy,
among other issues, on the sidelines of IMF meetings.	
 ""It is another political tool, along with the exchange rate
issue, of the United States and developed countries to contain
China's economic development,"" Li wrote in an article published
on the ministry's website.	
 ""The external imbalance is a sensitive issue regarding the
rights of China and other emerging economies to develop and
grow,"" Li said.	
 China has opposed the idea of targeting countries' current
account imbalances ever since it was suggested by U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner as a measure to use to rebalance the
world economy.	
 Analysts say while China is amenable to importing more to
help rebalancing efforts, it does not want to be assessed on its
huge current account surplus because that includes interest
payments on nearly $3 trillion of foreign reserves accumulated
over the years.	
 Instead, China prefers to be assessed on its trade surplus,
which has been narrowing as it imports more.	
 At a G20 meeting in Paris earlier this year, Chinese Finance
Minister Xie Xuren said the G20 should assess distortions in the
economy by measuring trade rather than current account balances,
and also rejected using real exchange rates and currency
reserves as measures.	
 That left China as a major impediment to a G20 deal, and
cast doubts over the group's ability to agree to a set of
guidelines to improve the world economy. [ID:nLDE71H0AV]	
 Li on Tuesday sought to draw attention away from China,
however.	
 Reiterating China's long-standing assertion that the United
States has a hand in much of the world's economic woes, Li said
super-loose monetary policies in the United States and elsewhere
were fuelling inflation.	
 He also said the European debt crisis could worsen by
spreading from the peripheral euro zone region.	
 He said loans from the International Monetary Fund and
European Union to struggling euro zone countries do not address
""underlying structural problems"", among which is the dearth of a
unified fiscal policy in the euro zone. 
 ""Austerity measures that are being imposed may worsen the
economic and debt conditions in the countries,"" Li said. ""The
euro debt crisis may continue to spread and deteriorate.""	
 As such, Li said he expected the U.S. dollar and euro to
weaken. That will be a headache for China since its $2.85
trillion foreign reserves are primarily invested in the two
currencies.

 By Paritosh Bansal, Soyoung Kim and Benjamin Lim
 NEW YORK/BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - Zhang Guobao didn't
mince words. More than 18 months after U.S. lawmakers killed an
attempt by China National Offshore Oil Corp to buy Unocal in
2005, the senior Chinese official gave the American ambassador
a piece of his mind.
 ""If the United States would not allow CNOOC to purchase
Unocal, will not itself guarantee China a steady energy supply
and opposes Chinese purchases of Iranian oil and gas, how can
China survive?"" he asked, according to a summary of his
comments in a U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks and
made available to Reuters by a third party.
 The decision to block the purchase of the California oil
company ""will have many after effects,"" Zhang said in the
February 2007 meeting with Clark Randt, then U.S. ambassador to
China.
 His warning was worth heeding.
 Ever since strident political opposition killed the $18.5
billion Unocal deal on the grounds that it could damage U.S.
national security, deal making between the world's two largest
economies has been in limbo. A series of planned acquisitions
have died in the hands of bureaucrats or politicians in Beijing
and Washington, and other ideas haven't seen the light of day
because of fear they will also be blocked.
 Last year, U.S. companies in China struck dozens of small
deals but they were collectively worth just $3.2 billion, while
Chinese companies spent only $3 billion on U.S. acquisitions,
Thomson Reuters data shows. That is a remarkably trivial amount
given the two nation's deepening economic relations: China is
one of America's top creditors and the U.S. is by far China's
largest export market.
 Last week, China's biggest metals trading firm, Minmetals
Resources, said it had offered more than all those deals put
together -- $6.5 billion -- to buy one company, but it wasn't
American. It was the Sydney and Toronto-listed African copper
producer Equinox Minerals.
 All told, Chinese companies made larger investments in
countries such as Brazil and Argentina last year than they did
in the United States.
 The optimism that led to deals such as the acquisition by
China's Lenovo Group of IBM's ThinkPad PC unit in May 2005,
despite questions from U.S. regulators, seems very distant now.
What has emerged instead can be likened to an M&A Cold War.
 And it's not just bankers who are suffering. The lack of
dealmaking could prevent the two countries from shifting to a
more mature relationship that doesn't just depend on Americans
buying massive amounts of cheap Chinese goods and the Chinese
buying American debt to fund a huge U.S. budget deficit.
 The Cold War will also likely hamper U.S. companies as they
try to penetrate the fast-growing Chinese market.
 For its part, China is missing out on not just unfettered
access to the American consumer market but the chance to pick
up global brand names, technology and management expertise.
 The diplomatic cables reviewed by Reuters underscore
Beijing's growing frustration with the situation.
 Zhang, who recently stepped down as China's top energy
official and was at the time of the cable a vice chairman at
the powerful ministry-level planning body, the National
Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), had taken the CNOOC
rejection personally, in the view of U.S. officials. He had
approved the energy company's bid for Unocal after being told
by consultants in the United States that there wouldn't be any
problems, the cable indicates.
 This was no ordinary Chinese technocrat who had been
snubbed. A self-described humorous raconteur, he told the
ambassador he would often walk out of meetings early after
having his say, or if he felt forced to stay he would write
poetry rather than take notes.
 ""Zhang, who clearly relishes his reputation for success,
would appear to still feel the sting of that very public
failure,"" the cable concluded.
 Such bitterness is shared among a lot of those involved in
thwarted deals who appear in dozens of U.S. diplomatic cables
written between 2006 and 2010 and recently reviewed by Reuters.
The pattern has begun to resemble Mutually Assured Deals
Destruction -- that is, each time a deal gets killed it seems
to have repercussions for the next.
 Some of the sources who provided information to U.S.
diplomats have not been fully identified in this report for
their own protection.
 BEATEN TO A PULP
 China had its turn in 2008, when Coca-Cola Co made a $2.4
billion bid for Chinese juice maker Huiyuan.
 Initially, the soft drinks behemoth was confident there
would be no major problems. After all, it had the backing of
Huiyuan's largest shareholders, had offered a 200 percent
premium and the fruit drink business was officially listed as a
sector where foreign investment was encouraged. It even thought
a new anti-monopoly law in China would work in its favor.
 Coke had heard informally that the Ministry of Commerce
planned to take a ""market-based view"" of the bid, Coca-Cola
Pacific Deputy Group President Paul Etchells told U.S.
officials in a Sept. 17, 2008 meeting.
 Coke didn't see the need to lobby senior Chinese government
officials. ""It was so obviously not a national security issue,""
was Etchells' view.
 But U.S. embassy officials saw problems with that view
stemming from the M&A Cold War -- as well as Coke's ignorance.
They noted in a cable at the time that Coca-Cola ""troublingly
was unaware"" whether the Ministry of Commerce would consider
just the anti-monopoly law for its competitive effects or also
look for its impact under regulations that govern takeovers of
famous Chinese brands and transactions that impact China's
""national economic security.""
 ""Coca-Cola may not fully appreciate the range of problems
the proposed transaction could encounter,"" U.S. officials
concluded.
 On March 18, 2009, the deal was officially dead, rejected
by the Ministry of Commerce, which cited competition concerns.
The headline of the cable from the embassy got straight to the
point -- ""Coca-Cola's bid for juice maker Huiyuan beaten to a
pulp.""
 Later a senior Chinese foreign policy scholar told U.S.
officials the decision to reject the bid was motivated by
concerns about domestic food security as well as popular
opinion that saw the sale of a well-known Chinese brand as a
matter of national pride.
 Coca-Cola said last week that it was ""disappointed that we
did not succeed in obtaining approval for the acquisition of
the Huiyuan juice business, but we respect the Ministry's
decision. We are now focused on the growth of our existing
brands, including in the juice segment.""
 POLITICAL FOOTBALL
 In October 2005, just months after the Unocal bid was
foiled, U.S. private equity giant Carlyle Group proposed to buy
an 85 percent stake in Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co.
 The buyout shop first ran into ""pushback from bureaucratic
interests"" and had to revise its offer down to buying a
minority stake, but after three years of wrangling it abandoned
the bid, according to the cables.
 In a June 21, 2007 cable, a Shanghai consulate official
quotes a well-connected Chinese businessman as laying the blame
on bureaucratic infighting between officials at the Ministry of
Commerce and the NDRC.
 The ministry had recommended approving the bid to the State
Council. A series of other government agencies, including the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, also supported it, the
businessman told U.S. officials.
 But the NDRC threw a spanner in the works, arguing that it
should be the entity responsible for approving the bid rather
than the Ministry of Commerce. And it forced Carlyle and Xugong
back to the negotiating table over the ministry's objections,
the cable said.
 ""Carlyle was tired of being punted around like a political
football while the ministries fought over who had control of
the deal and the investment approval process generally,"" the
businessman said.
 Adding to the intrigue, one source with knowledge of the
deal told Reuters recently the deal fell apart because
privately owned domestic rival Sany Heavy Industry Co had
""fanned the flames of anti-foreign sentiment"" because it too
had its eyes on Xugong. Sany's bid also failed after being
rejected by Xugong.
 ""China welcomes private equity capital and is a great
market for Carlyle,"" the private equity firm's spokesman
Christopher Ullman said. ""We've invested more than $3 billion
in equity in 50 transactions and are firmly committed to
investing for the long-term in China.""
 NDRC and Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request
for comment for this article.
 Sometimes, it is Beijing itself that has killed bids for
American companies by Chinese companies.
 In June 2009, a little-known Chinese maker of special-use
vehicles and bridge and highway components, Sichuan Tengzhong
Heavy Industrial Machinery, emerged as the surprise bidder for
General Motors' Hummer brand.
 The only problem -- for the Chinese government it was the
wrong deal at the wrong time by the wrong company. Acquiring
and then producing a brand built on macho, gas-guzzling
vehicles flew in the face of Beijing's push for greener and
cleaner technologies.
 Eight months later, the proposed takeover collapsed.
 Hummer's Detroit-based government affairs representative
Wei Shen told U.S. embassy officials days before the deal fell
apart that the Ministry of Commerce determined the transaction
did not qualify for China's ""technology transfer"" regulations
and refused to accept the application.
 Other forces appear to have been at play as well. A vice
minister opposed the transaction because of his connections to
Chinese automaker Dongfeng Motor Corp, which produced a rival
product to Hummer, according to one cable.
 Hummer's Shen also said there was some ""bad blood"" between
Tengzhong and officials in its home province of Sichuan in
southwest China that might have hampered the proposal.
 GM declined to comment for this article. Sichuan Tengzhong
did not respond to a request for comment.
 MILITARY THREAT
 The Chinese aren't faring any better in the United States.
 In Washington, it is often fear of China's increasing
military strength that gets lawmakers and top government
officials to agitate against deals.
 Perhaps the biggest victim of this has been China's
telecommunications equipment company Huawei Technologies Co,
which competes with the likes of Cisco Systems and is one of
the few Chinese companies that has built a truly global brand
name.
 Huawei's first public setback came in March 2008, when U.S.
private equity firm Bain Capital broke off a joint bid for U.S.
network equipment maker 3Com Corp because the U.S. government's
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)
had said it would block the $2.2 billion deal.
 Several U.S. lawmakers complained the transaction, which
would have given Huawei up to 21.5 percent of 3Com, threatened
national security due to Huawei's alleged ties to the Chinese
military and given that 3Com sold security technology and
network equipment to U.S. government agencies as well as
businesses.
 Huawei has maintained that it is a private company owned by
employees, but acknowledges that founder Ren Zhengfei was once
in the People's Liberation Army. Just a few days before the bid
was abandoned, Ren met U.S. officials in China and denied
claims that either Huawei or he had close ties to the Chinese
government or the nation's military.
 ""Ren complained that neither the U.S. nor the Chinese
Government trusted Huawei,"" the cable from the Guangzhou
consulate reads, adding that he said Huawei has had to slow its
expansion plans on more than one occasion as a result.
 The company's status shows little sign of improving.
Indeed, it was thwarted earlier this year in the bid it
launched last May to buy tiny Santa Clara, California-based
server technology firm 3Leaf for $2 million. After completing
its review of the deal, CFIUS suggested in February that Huawei
should sell off the assets.
 Huawei has also lost out on at least one telecom contract
in the U.S. on the same grounds.
 The company gave up on the 3Leaf deal but this time it has
challenged the United States to launch a formal investigation
so that it can try to clear its name. And last week as it
opened a new R&D facility in Silicon Valley it expressed hope
that its U.S. government relations were improving.
 Ratcheting up the tension, Beijing on Feb. 21 complained
formally that Washington was blocking Chinese investment in
U.S. companies.
 ""The U.S. side has used all kinds of excuses, including
national security, to engage in obstruction and interference in
the trade and investment activities of Chinese businesses in
the U.S.,"" the Ministry of Commerce said.
 ""To some extent, this obstruction and interference is
affecting China-U.S. trade and economic cooperation,"" the
ministry cautioned.
 POLITICAL RISK
 It's not just military questions that up-end deals.
 China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, was
prepared to pump billions of dollars of new capital into Morgan
Stanley to raise its stake to 49 percent from almost 10 percent
at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 when the
investment bank was fighting for its survival.
 But the deal was nixed. And Chinese officials came away
believing the worst.
 Reports circulating in Beijing suggested that U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner, who was then the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had stepped in to block it
because he did not want to have ""funny money"" own nearly half
of one of America's biggest and best-known investment banks,
Charles Liu, a well-connected executive of a Chinese private
equity firm told U.S. embassy officials.
 Liu said CIC Chairman Lou Jiwei had become very cautious
about further investments in U.S. financial businesses, in part
because of what ""he regards as the hostile regulatory
environment to Chinese investment in that sector,"" according to
one cable from February 2009.
 CIC did not respond to a request for comment. A Treasury
official said the assertion that Geithner stepped in to kill
the CIC-Morgan Stanley deal was ""nonsense"" and that the
Treasury secretary never expressed such an opinion.
 For the Chinese, the lack of transparency in reviews by
CFIUS and its secretive nature are tough to cope with.
 The committee, which is led by the treasury secretary and
includes the head of the Department of Homeland Security,
reviews cross-border deals for their impact on national
security, but almost never comments on deals that come before
it until a decision is made. That makes it difficult for
companies and their lobbyists to handle any misperceptions.
 And none of this is getting any easier.
 Indeed, the Chinese seem to be aping some of the more
questionable parts of the American system. In March, Beijing
launched a state-level investment review body to ensure deals
involving foreign firms do not endanger national security,
installing a new red-tape barrier for doing business in China.
 Even before this came in, some U.S. companies had found
creative ways to structure deals to avoid regulatory
headaches.
 Eric Zhang, a Carlyle executive, told embassy officials the
private equity giant only files anti-monopoly paperwork when
specifically told to by Chinese regulators, despite being
encouraged to file for every investment, according to a Dec.
2009 cable.
 ""It just causes too many headaches and we'd never get
anything approved,"" the executive said.
 Some of the resistance to U.S. acquisitions may lie in an
increase in patriotic sensibilities in China.
 The cables show, for example, that a speech then U.S.
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson gave at the Shanghai Futures
Exchange in March 2007 didn't go down well with everyone in the
audience.
 A top Shanghai financial department official, Fang Xinghai,
admonished Paulson for his assertion that he had never seen a
successful joint venture securities firm. This was seen as a
""direct attack"" on the Chinese model that had allowed Goldman
Sachs to set up the joint venture when Paulson was CEO of the
Wall Street firm.
 In a meeting with the Shanghai consul general, Fang was
also reported as saying: ""Some Chinese officials questioned the
tone of Secretary Paulson's remarks, noting that he had spoken
'very directly' and 'was telling us what to do.'""
 ""It had caused some in the audience to react in a
'nationalistic' or defensive manner,"" Fang and Shanghai Futures
Exchange CEO Yang Maijun were reported in a cable as
concluding.
 Such nationalistic sentiments got a boost after the
financial crisis. Some financial services and private equity
executives cited in one Feb. 2010 cable from Hong Kong pointed
to ""China's rising assertiveness in light of the country's
continued growth and positive role in the global recovery.""
 ""Although the U.S. still had considerable influence in the
region, security reviews that made it difficult for some
travelers to obtain U.S. visas and high profile CFIUS-related
cases had damaged America's reputation in Asia for openness,""
one executive said in the cable. ""Following the financial
crisis, Asians' tolerance for being lectured by the West had
markedly declined.""
 Of course, not every deal gets shot down.
 Late last year, state-owned China Huaneng Group Corp agreed
to buy a 50 percent stake in Burlington-based electric utility
InterGen for $1.2 billion in cash. CNOOC came back to the
United States in recent months as well with joint venture
investments in Chesapeake Energy Corp shale projects.
 Last week, executives from CNOOC and Huawei were on a charm
offensive on the U.S. West Coast.
 CNOOC Chairman Chengyu Fu said in Los Angeles the
atmosphere for foreign investments in the United States was
welcoming and it planned to make more through partnerships,
while Huawei U.S. division group chief technology officer Matt
Bross said that after the 3Leaf deal disappointment, more
formal channels had been created between the company and the
U.S. government and there was now ""a better understanding.""
 But in many ways the picture in Washington may be
deteriorating.
 Lawmakers on Capitol Hill indicated in a series of
interviews that they are far from feeling more receptive to
Chinese takeovers of anything remotely sensitive in terms of
military or technological value. And fears that China is
starting to pour its economic might into a more powerful
military is adding to the wariness.
 ""The Chinese buildup of its military, particularly its
naval fleet, has made people more concerned about what China's
ultimate intentions are,"" said Republican Senator Susan Collins
when asked about the sensitivity of Chinese acquisitions. ""So,
I think there is a great deal of concern.""
 Collins said she was particularly worried about inroads
China has made into the U.S. telecommunications industry based
on classified briefings she has received. Cyber attacks
emanating from China and seemingly aimed at the intellectual
property of U.S. companies were another concern, she said.
 EVERY BUSH AND TREE
 For Democratic Senator Jack Reed it is the close ties
between Chinese companies and the government in Beijing that
makes him suspicious.
 ""The real concern -- and it has to be case by case -- is
that many of these companies are so closely intertwined with
the government of China that it is hard to see where the
company stops and the country begins, and vice versa,"" he
said.
 Such thinking doesn't go over well in Beijing. ""It's
excessive anxiety,"" said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a think
tank in China's Ministry of Commerce.
 ""For the U.S., every bush and tree looks like an enemy
soldier,"" he said, adapting an old Chinese saying.
 The next 18 months could be particularly rocky for
Sino-U.S. dealmaking, according to William Reinsch, president
of the National Foreign Trade Council, a business association
focused on international trade and investment issues.
 The U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections are due
in November 2012. And in China towards the end of next year,
President Hu Jintao is expected to hand over the reins of power
to his heir-apparent Xi Jinping.
 ""We could see a deterioration next year that is politically
motivated in both countries -- in that case I think you have a
potentially very serious problem,"" Reinsch said.

States are expected to jump 70 percent in 2011 because of a
supply squeeze in Asia-Pacific, while a weak dollar has made
U.S. cargoes more attractive, top U.S. coal exporter Xcoal
Energy & Resources said.	
 Total coal exports to Asia from the U.S. are expected to
reach 20.1 million tonnes this year after impressive growth of
250 percent in 2010 over 2009, Xcoal Chief Executive Ernie
Thrasher told an industry conference in Beijing on Tuesday. 
 Exports to Asia began at a low base in 2009, so overall
growth would be slower in 2011 than the previous year, he said.	
 Despite taking more than 45 days to reach Asia, coal
shipments from the U.S. have surged in Japan and China over the
past year because of the emergence of price arbitrage.	
 Faced with a demand slump in traditional European markets,
many U.S. producers turned to Asia in 2009 as an alternative
supply destination and were able to offer more attractive prices
than Australian producers.	
 However, Thrasher said U.S. coking coal producers should see
sustained robust demand from Asia as increasingly tight supply
would continue to force steel mills to look further afield. High
quality U.S. coking coal also serves as a good blending product
for indigenous coal from China. 
 ""The global coking coal market is extremely tight and it
will take a number of years before new fields come into
production,"" Thrasher said.	
 Privately held Xcoal exported 9.66 million tonnes of coal
last year.

 ""As we drive these scales of economy, it will be difficult

 The global shipping industry has rebounded strongly from the
worst downturn in history in 2009 as the recession hit global
trade and forced many companies to lay up ships and cut jobs. 
 The industry, seen as a key indicator of global economic
activity, however, would face a shortage of ships in the coming
years due to surging demand, especially in Asia.	
 Some industry experts also said that with most operators
running the ships at a slower speed to conserve fuel, more
vessels were needed to serve the same volume of cargo.	
 Maersk had said that the 18,000 TEU container vessels will
be used to serve the benchmark Asia-European route and likely
call at five Chinese ports.

 * 
 * BRICS meet in China with wind in their sails
 * Trade, investment ties set to keep growing fast
 * Yuan's exchange rate, dominant China role cast shadows

 By Alan Wheatley, Global Economics Correspondent	
 BEIJING, April 11 (Reuters) - Cheap Chinese exports have
decimated Brazil's shoe industry and South Africa's textile
sector. India has slapped anti-dumping duties on an array of
Chinese goods. Russia is sparring with Beijing over the price of
oil it sells to China.	
 If trade is the mortar holding together the BRICS -- Brazil,
Russia, India, China and newcomer South Africa -- the omens
would appear poor for the grouping, which holds its annual
summit on Thursday in the southern Chinese island of Hainan.	
 To its detractors, BRICS is an artificial construct -- an
example of life imitating not art but Goldman Sachs, which
coined the acronym BRIC in 2001 for four fast-growing,
politically diverse countries that it reckoned were reshaping
the global economy.	
 Yet a more optimistic view holds that the explosion in
South-South trade, which leapt to 17 percent of the global total
in 2009 from 7 percent in 1990, has a long way to run.	
 Moreover, some experts say the BRICS caucus has already
shown its worth as a counterweight to the West in global talks
on trade and climate change and, within the Group of 20, on how
to redistribute power in international financial institutions.	
 In each case, despite differing positions, the five have
acted collectively to prevent advanced countries from driving a
wedge between them, said Sourabh Gupta with Samuels
International Associates, an international trade and political
risk assessment firm in Washington.	
 ""There is a certain basic logic to their economic
interaction,"" Gupta said. ""They have not allowed themselves to
be co-opted by Western countries. Either they're going to hang
together or hang alone.""



 This is not to deny that China's export juggernaut is
causing strains, exacerbated by Beijing's determination to let
the yuan rise only slowly.	
 Countries such as Brazil -- but also the likes of Portugal
-- that are above China on the value chain are struggling to
compete in intermediate, capital-intensive products.	
 ""They have genuine reasons to be worried. If nothing else,
at least the unfairness arising from the yuan's undervaluation
is an issue that needs to be tackled pronto,"" Gupta said.	
 Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff will broach the issue of
the yuan, but her officials say she will avoid direct
confrontation.	
 ""What we want is more reciprocity,"" Rodrigo Baena, the
presidential spokesman, said about the objectives of her
five-day visit to China starting on Tuesday. [ID:nN07149192]	
 
 POLICY FAILINGS	
 Indian manufacturers have also grumbled at being hollowed
out by their Chinese rivals, but Gupta does not expect an
unmanageable surge in protectionism.	
 ""There is a good deal of anger about Chinese products, but
there is also, deep down, an awareness in India that part of
this is policy failings at their end,"" he said.	
 India would stand a better chance of broadening the base of
its exports to China, now dominated by commodities, if it eased
labour laws that put manufacturers in a straitjacket.	
 More generally, Southern economies are shooting themselves
in the foot by levying much higher import duties on goods from
other Southern countries, 6.1 percent on average, than the 2.5
percent they face in the West, according to the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).	
 Still, the Manila-based bank expects the South-South share
of global trade to double in the next two decades.	
 With developing Asia accounting for about 75 percent of
South-South commerce, and China alone taking up about 40
percent, the challenge for the BRICS is to divide the cake more
evenly.	
 The trade share of Latin America and Africa is in fact
rising fast, but that is because of China's hunger for oil and
raw materials, bought in exchange for low-cost consumer goods.
Some China critics have branded this model of trade as
neo-colonial.	
 One answer, the ADB says, is to expand the production
networks of ""Factory Asia"" to other regions in the South to
churn out goods for price-sensitive local consumers.	
 ""Not only will developing Asia's foreign direct investment
in these new networks enhance employment opportunities, raise
workers' incomes, increase domestic demand, and enhance growth
prospects, it will also address in part global imbalances by
recycling high savings in developing Asia into investment in the
South,"" the ADB said in a report last week.

 YOU'RE WELCOME, MORE OR LESS	
 Simon Freemantle, who analyses Africa's political economy
for Standard Bank in Johannesburg, said China was already
repositioning itself as a ""development partner"" for Africa and
learning the lessons from episodes of anti-Chinese sentiment.	
 Zambia recently dropped charges against two Chinese managers
accused of attempted murder for firing at 11 coal miners during
a protest over pay. [ID:nLDE7331B5]	
 Despite such incidents, Africa is by and large receptive to
booming Chinese trade and investment, Freemantle said.	
 The textile industry in South Africa and Botswana has taken
a big blow, but across the continent families can now afford new
Chinese clothes instead of making do with Western hand-me-downs.	
 Around four in five Nigerians and Kenyans in a recent BBC
World Service poll welcomed China's growing clout. ""All African
countries view China's increasing economic power positively,""
the survey said. [ID:nLDE72O1J4]	
 Standard Bank sees no let-up in the acceleration of
commercial ties. By 2015, Sino-African trade could easily exceed
$300 billion, compared with $93 billion in 2009 and about $125
billion in 2010, Freemantle said.	
 And, as this week's BRICS summit shows, where trade goes,
politics will follow, especially as economic power moves East in
the wake of the global financial crisis.	
 ""African countries are increasingly aware of this global
shift and placing China in a more central role in their foreign
policy objectives,"" Freemantle said.

 By Ramya Venugopal	
 SINGAPORE, April 12 (Reuters) - A decline in crude oil
prices on Tuesday from a 32-month high that could extend in the
near term triggered a bout of profit taking in risky assets,
causing investors to sell equities and slash their bets against
the yen and U.S. dollar. 
 The global rout in commodity prices also hurt demand for the
Australian dollar, which dropped 2 percent against the yen, and
weighed on U.S. stock futures. 
 The drop in crude was triggered in part by a Goldman Sachs
report, which advised investors to lock-in trading profits
before oil and other commodity markets reverse. [ID:nN11113549].	
 ""Open interest has been building up since the start of the
new quarter in April, reflecting fresh inflows of speculative
money into the oil market,"" said an energy analyst at a leading
Japanese trading house who declined to be named. 
 ""The Goldman report put a damper on this flow, at least for
now, given that there was a sense of an overshoot in the
market,"" he said. 
 Brent crude for May  fell to a low of $121.97 a
barrel, easing from Monday's 32-month peak of $127.02. U.S.
crude  fell to as low as $107.87. 
 Developments in Libya, where a peace bid collapsed on
Monday, may also provide cues. [ID:nLDE73A2B7]	
 Brent may fall to as low as $118.67, while U.S. crude may
find support at $106.81, charts indicated. 
 Commodity shares from Australia to Japan led a broad decline
in Asian equities, after energy and metals prices slid
overnight, while gold and silver, traditionally safe-haven
investments, also gave up gains. 
 Tokyo's Nikkei share average ended the day down 1.6
percent, as blue-chip stocks declined on increasing
uncertainties about the earnings outlook after the March 11
earthquake.	
 ""Many people worry that more and more large-cap companies
including big automakers may cut their earnings estimates for
the business year,"" said Hideo Arimura, senior fund manager at
Mizuho Asset Management. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was down 1.8 percent and on course for the
biggest daily decline since the quake in Japan triggered panic
selling in the region on March 15. 
 Days after that though foreign investors had been key buyers
of Asian shares, pushing the benchmark indexes of major markets
up between 7 percent and 13 percent over the past three weeks.

The U.S. dollar fell to 83.80 yen per dollar , off a

(Adds details, background)	
 WELLINGTON, April 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank
highlighted on Tuesday the inflation danger from rising terms of
trade, but said its interest rate focus was still aimed at the
medium term, giving the local currency a modest boost.	
 New Zealand's economy is struggling to recover from a
prolonged downturn, exacerbated this year by a devastating
earthquake, but one of its current strengths is a strong rise in
the terms of trade which has also buoyed the New Zealand dollar.	
 ""If households and firms use the income boost from higher
commodity prices and exchange rates to bring forward consumption
and investment, or increase borrowing, then pressure on
resources in New Zealand would lead to more inflationary
pressure,"" Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) head Alan Bollard
said in speech notes released by the central bank on Tuesday.	
 ""Monetary policy would need to counteract any rise in
inflation expectations.""	
 The New Zealand dollar firmed modestly after the
notes were released and last traded around $0.7820 from $0.7790.	
 Interest rate futures <0#NBB:> fell as many as eight ticks
for year-end contracts, and swap rates rose as much as
6.5 basis points.	
 Financial market pricing implied 56 basis points of rate
rises over the next 12 months from the previous 47 basis points
, although there is no chance of a rate move seen
at the April 28 review.	
 The Treasury department said last week the country's
external accounts were benefiting from a strong export showing,
with terms of trade hitting a 37-year high in December.	
 Annual inflation rate jumped to 4.0 percent in the December
quarter, the highest level in more than two years following a
rise in sales tax.	
 The RBNZ, which is required to keep inflation within a 1-3
percent target band on average over the medium term, has said it
will look through this policy-driven spike in inflation.	
 Goldman Sachs economist Philip Borkin said there were no
immediate policy implications from the speech, because higher
incomes from the terms of trade were being used to reduce debt
rather than boost consumption and inflationary pressures.	
 ""Until evidence to the contrary emerges, we believe the RBNZ
will be happy maintaining stimulatory monetary policy for a
little longer,"" he said.	
 The RBNZ last month slashed its cash by 50 basis points to
2.5 percent to help cushion the economy and sentiment after the
deadly Feb. 22 earthquake struck the country's second-biggest
city, Christchurch.	
 A Reuters poll has a median expectation of the first rise in
the first quarter of next year although there is a sizeable
minority view of a hike as early as December this year.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2011 07:56PM ET</span>",RPT-PREVIEW-India monsoon meet likely to forecast near-normal rains ," (Repeats story from April 11)	
 * What: Meeting of regional monsoon experts
 * When: Consensus South Asian monsoon forecast on April 15
 * Where: Pune, India

 By Krittivas Mukherjee and Ratnajyoti Dutta	
 NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - Global experts meeting this
week are likely to forecast a near-normal monsoon for India,
providing international commodities market the first hints of
demand and supply in 2011/12 from one of the world's top
producers and consumers of key farm goods.	
 Failure of monsoons can force India into the international
markets as a buyer, pushing up global prices of basic
foodstuffs, while favourable rainfall can boost its exports,
helping governments throughout Asia to battle food inflation.	
 Agriculture accounts for a 14.6 percent of India's GDP and
the outcome of the annual June-September southwest monsoons
impacts the nation's economy, which is struggling with high food
inflation and a massive subsidy bill for fuel, grains and
fertilisers.	
 A normal monsoon means the country receives rainfall between
96-104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 centimetres during the
four-month rainy season, according to the India's weather office
classification.
    Monsoons also impact demand for gold in India, the world's
top consumer of the metal, as purchases get a boost when farming
incomes rise amid high crop output. Rural areas account for
about 70 percent of India's annual gold consumption.
    India witnessed normal rains last year and the April 13-15
meeting of weather officials in the southwestern city of Pune is
likely to forecast a near-normal monsoon this year based on
various forecasting models, Indian officials said.	
 ""The weakening phase of La Nina has given rise to the
expectation of a near-normal monsoon in 2011,"" said D. R. Sikka,
former director of the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical
Meteorology.	
 Other officials of the Indian weather office, who did not
wish to be identified, agreed. A La Nina weather pattern causes
heavier-than-normal rains in South Asia. After the weak phase,
the La Nina is expected to enter a neutral phase without posing
any threat to good rainfall during the monsoon season.	
 The Pune meeting will issue a consensus forecast for the
monsoon on the final day of the conference.	

    While India is mostly self-sufficient in staples like wheat
and rice for its 1.2 billion population, drought can push the
country into international markets as it did in 2009 when India
had to import sugar -- sending global prices to record highs.
    The government subsidises the price of key crops to contain
inflation and ensure half a billion poor -- many of whom spend
up to 60 percent of their incomes on food -- can afford to eat.
    The first official Indian forecast is not due until later
this month. During 2009, the driest monsoon in 37 years caused
widespread losses to key crops such as oilseeds and sugarcane,
pushing up food inflation and causing a political headache for
the government.   
   
    POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
    Monsoon forecasting in India is carried out by
government-backed organisations and has significant political
implications in a country where more than 60 percent of voters
are in rural communities and form the bulk of the government's
support base.
    Bad rainfall results in political pressure on the
government, as farmers demand higher rates for their produce and
ask bureaucrats to waive loan repayment and electricity charges,
impacting public finances.
    Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's ruling Congress government,
mired in a slew of corruption charges, has struggled with
double-digit food inflation for most of its second term in
office since 2009 when it won an election partly by boosting
farm incomes. In early 2010, India's food inflation went as high
as 22 percent on supply constraints.
    The government hopes monsoon rains -- which traverse the
subcontinent from its southern tip to the Himalayan north from
June through September -- would boost farm output and help
lower prices, potentially providing a timely political boost
ahead of key state elections.
    ""The budget, and the economy as a whole, it is said is a
gamble on the monsoon,"" Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a leading Indian
political columnist, told Reuters. ""The reason is simple --
roughly 60 percent of crop area in the country is rain-fed.""
   
    HIGHER EXPORTS
    Higher agricultural supplies triggered by normal rains could
encourage the Indian government to allow overseas sale of wheat
and lift export curbs on rice. 
 India faces a storage problem as the 2011 wheat harvest is
set to be a record, exceeding demand for a fifth straight year.
    ""The government can make a bold decision on grain exports.
It can tinker with policies if the monsoon shapes up on expected
lines,"" said Veeresh Hiremath, research head of the
Hyderabad-based broking Karvy Comtrade.
    Higher oilseed output last year helped India increase
oilmeals exports to traditional buyers in southeast Asia by more
than half to 5.1 million tonnes. [ID:nL3E7F815S]
    In most parts of India, the monsoon accounts for 75-90
percent of the total annual rainfall.

 By Anna Ringstrom
 REYKJAVIK, April 11 (Reuters) - Iceland can pay whatever
bill results from court action over debts owed to Britain and
the Netherlands from a bank crash, the country's central bank
chief said a day after Icelanders rejected a negotiated
repayment plan.
 In a referendum on Sunday Icelanders voted for a second time
to throw out a plan to repay Britain and the Netherlands for
bailing out depositors in failed Icelandic bank Landsbanki's
online ""Icesave"" savings accounts.
 Proceeds from the sale of Landsbanki assets will go to
paying back Britain and the Netherlands, starting in the coming
months. 
 Whether Icelandic taxpayers risk having to foot any
remaining bill after that is now likely to be settled in a
lengthy European Free Trade (EFTA) court. Economists have said
the court route could be costlier than the rejected deal.
 ""I expect Iceland to be able to pay ... in case the court
rules that there is an obligation,"" Sedlabanki Governor Mar
Gudmundsson told Reuters in an interview.
 He said the effect of the ""no"" vote on Iceland's economy,
which went into deep recession after the 2008 bank crash, would
depend to a large extent on whether credit rating agencies
lowered their ratings on the news.
 Iceland's economy has stabilised with the help of an
International Monetary Fund-led rescue programme. 
 But the recovery is fragile and the 'no' vote may leave the
country facing delays ending currency controls, boosting
investment and returning to financial markets for funding.
 But IMF Iceland resident representative Franek Rozwadowski
said the 'no' vote is unlikely to jeopardize economic or
monetary stability in Iceland, as quoted by Frettabladid
newspaper on Monday.
 He said the debt repayment to the British and the Dutch was
not a condition for the IMF programme, although the fund had
seen a solution as important for the economic recovery of
Iceland.
 Credit rating agencies have been watching the Icesave vote
closely and Fitch said on Monday the result reduces the prospect
of it raising its junk rating on Iceland to investment grade in
the relatively near future.
 Moody's had said it might lower Iceland's rating in case of
a 'no'.
 Britain and the Netherlands said on Sunday they were
disappointed over the outcome, and British newspaper The
Independent said it increased the chances Britain or the
Netherlands, both European Union members, might veto Iceland's
bid to join the bloc.
 The Financial Times said that besides highlighting flaws in
European cross-border banking rules, the case raised doubts over
the future of Iceland's centre-left government, which has said
it will not resign despite the defeat.
 The governemnt of Johanna Sigurdardottir has said a fresh
round of talks on further funding from the IMF would be delayed
several weeks.
 Sedlabanki's Gudmundsson said Iceland has enough foreign
exchange reserves to cover debts up to 2015.
 ""And long before 2015, the EFTA court will have ruled on the
Icesave dispute one way or the other. And then we will know if
there is an (Icesave debt repayment) obligation or not,"" he
said.

(Adds details, comment, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell
sharply on Monday on concerns high prices could erode demand
and threaten economic recovery, while a sell-off in energy
shares and jitters about corporate earnings hit U.S. stocks.
 Brent and U.S. crude oil also came under pressure earlier
after the African Union said Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had
accepted a road map to end the civil war, including an
immediate ceasefire, though rebels said any settlement would
require Gaddafi step down. For details, see [ID:nLDE7390JP]
 Analysts were skeptical about the peace deal, and even if
an end to the civil war were in sight, it will be some time
before Libyan exports return to pre-conflict levels.
 Goldman Sachs told clients there is a strong chance
commodity prices may reverse, recommending they take profits.
[ID:nN11303064]
 ""Not only are there now nascent signs of oil demand
destruction in the United States, but also record speculative
length in the oil market, elections in Nigeria and a potential
ceasefire in Libya that has begun to offset some of the upside
risk owing to contagion,"" the investment bank's commodity
research team, led by Jeffrey Currie, said in a note.
 Brent crude oil for May  ended $2.67 lower at
$123.98 a barrel, dropping as low as $123.62 after reaching a
32-month peak of $127.02. U.S. crude  fell $2.87 to
settle at $109.92, pulling back after reaching an early $113.46
peak, the highest intraday price since September 2008.
 U.S. stocks ended mostly lower as falling oil prices
weighed on energy stocks and on fears that corporate earnings
may not justify a big run-up in equities.
 But Alcoa Inc , the first Dow component to release
results, reported a large first-quarter profit on Monday, after
a loss a year ago as the price of aluminum, its primary
product, rose sharply with demand for the metal.
 Profits in the first quarter of 2011 at S&P 500 companies
are seen rising 11.4 percent from a year ago, according to
Thomson Reuters data. For details, see [ID:nN07256466]
 ""There's a question of whether companies can meet the
fairly optimistic expectations,"" said John Carey, portfolio
manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston, which has
about $260 billion in assets under management. ""There's
potential for disappointment, but if they come in line or
above, the market could experience a continued rally.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended up 1.06
points, or 0.01 percent, at 12,381.11, but the benchmark
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 3.71 points, or 0.28
percent to 1,324.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost
8.91 points, or 0.32 percent to 2,771.51.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.2 percent, with emerging markets <.MSCIEF> off 0.6 percent.
European stocks fell, with the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index
of top European shares down 0.2 percent.
 The International Monetary Fund said on Monday it did not
believe that rising commodity prices will derail the global
economic recovery but warned that inflation will remain
elevated for a while.
 DOLLAR'S GAINS LIMITED
 The U.S. dollar firmed against the euro after the U.S.
Congress on Friday reached a last-minute federal budget deal
that avoided a government shutdown. However, a focus on the
U.S. debt ceiling debate could limit any gains, traders said.
 A rebound in the dollar was also overdue after it fell
sharply against the euro on Friday continuing its downtrend of
the past four months. For the month of April, the dollar was
still down about 2.0 percent.
 On Monday the euro  fell 0.4 percent to $1.4426,
after hitting a 15-month high around $1.4486 on Friday.
 ""The euro's drop is nothing more than white noise and the
pullback should prove shallow,"" said Jessica Hoversen, foreign
exchange and fixed income analyst at MF Global in New York.
 Hoversen said the dollar's negative tone should continue as
long as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low and while
central banks abroad, namely the European Central Bank and Bank
of England, move closer to more normal borrowing costs.
 Expectations of another rise in European Central Bank
interest rates by July kept the euro close to recent highs and
pushed euro zone government bond prices lower. German Bund
yields  briefly rose above 3.5 percent for the
first time since August 2009.
 The yen was off an 11-month low against the euro and a
2-1/2-year trough versus the Australian dollar as another
earthquake in Japan led some investors to close riskier bets
funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2011 05:08PM ET</span>",World trade boss triggers Doha rescue timetable," * Texts publication April 21, last day before Easter-sources
 * Informal talks April 28, supreme body next day - source
 
 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, April 11 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation's
chief triggered a race to rescue stalled global trade talks on
Monday, setting a date for delivery of the crucial ""texts"" that
could make or break the process by the end of April.
 In a faxed message to WTO member country missions in Geneva,
Director-General Pascal Lamy said the Doha texts -- draft
agreements on a series of issues ranging from tariffs to rules
for settling disputes -- would be published on April 21, the
last day before the WTO closes its doors for the Easter holiday.
 Two sources with knowledge of the fax said the texts could
crystallise opinion on whether negotiators can achieve their
goal of a deal by the end of the year.
 ""We are at a pretty crucial stage here,"" one of the sources
said.
 Lamy, a former European Union trade commissioner, has staked
his reputation on making the texts work as a catalyst to
kick-start the discussions. 
 Talks have foundered on long-running disagreements between
players over who gives up or reduces which quotas, tariffs and
other barriers in exchange for better access to each other's
markets.
 Some countries, including the United States and Brazil in
particular, have expressed fears that forcing through the texts
might be counterproductive.
 They fear a ""top down"" process where the heads of the
various working groups charged with producing the texts try to
steer a middle course that no party can accept.
 Lamy, who has said for much of this year that he wants to
see texts by Easter, insisted last week that they would be no
more than a faithful representation ""of where we are"".
 Trade delegates say some of the April 21 texts, especially
two important ones on agricultural and non-agricultural market
access, might be barely changed from the 2008 texts that failed
to receive the backing of member countries that year.
 Others, such as ones on service industries and on the rules
governing disputes, might have made some progress, they say.
 
 APRIL 29 SHOWDOWN
 The second source said the days after April 21 could be
crucial as countries consider how, and whether, to bridge the
remaining gaps.
 A so-called ""green room"" informal discussion of the texts at
WTO will be the next step, the second source said, taking place
on April 28 and including the heads of the big players and
representatives of the various interest groups of countries.
 A meeting of the WTO'S Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC),
the Doha round's supreme body, will follow on April 29, the
source added.
 That meeting could be decisive because if it rejects the
texts as unworkable, government ministers who are due to meet
this summer will have nothing to work with.
 Lamy is under pressure to get back on track the so-called
Doha round of WTO trade negotiations which are aimed at keeping
tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to trade at bay in the
belief that more trade is good for all parties.
 The ambitious talks are almost a decade old. Failure to
secure an agreement this year could leave them in limbo as a
number of key WTO members enter election years in 2012.
 The WTO confirmed that texts would be published on April 21
but declined further comment.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded on
Monday from last week's sharp decline against the euro, but a
strong bearish stance toward the greenback is expected ahead of
next month's U.S. debt limit debate.
 Disparities in global central bank monetary policy will not
help the currency.
 The dollar found support after a U.S. government shutdown
was averted on Friday and the currency's rise was widely viewed
as overdue after its sell-off versus the euro for the last four
months. So far in April, the dollar is still down more than 2
percent.
 Interest rate differentials between Europe and the United
States, however, are expected to continue to support the euro
following the European Central Bank's 25-basis-point rate
increase last week. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected
to keep rates low until late this year or early 2012.
 While the Commodities Futures Trading Commission's latest
report showed a narrowing of the net short USD position to $30
billion, it was only because of a build in short yen positions.
All other currencies are net long against the dollar.
 ""Sentiment is extremely bearish the USD,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 The dollar index <.DXY >, which tracks the greenback
against a basket of currencies, was flat at 75.054, but only
slightly above the 16-month low of 74.84 set on Friday.
 Sutton said there are many reasons for the recent round of
USD weakness, but the two most important are diverging monetary
policy paths between the United States and the rest of the
advanced and developing economies and the weak U.S fiscal
position.
 ""A period of retracement is likely approaching, but we
still expect further USD weakness, with the most important risk
a shift in stance at the Fed,"" she said. ""We expect the USD to
close the year at weaker levels than it is currently trading.""
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro  fell
0.3 percent to $1.4430 after hitting a 15-month high around
$1.4486 on Friday. The high on electronic trading platform EBS
was $1.4485.
 ""The euro's drop today is nothing more than white noise,
and the pullback should prove shallow,"" said Jessica Hoversen,
foreign exchange and fixed income analyst at MF Global in New
York.
 The dollar's negative tone should remain in place as long
as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low and while
central banks abroad, namely the ECB and Bank of England, move
closer to more normal borrowing costs, she said.
 Even so, Hoversen said the euro will ultimately head lower
this year, particularly after Portugal last week sought
financial aid from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund.
 ""The ECB rate hikes are going to torpedo the fiscally weak
peripheral nations such as Spain, in terms of higher bank
funding and mortgage costs,"" she said.
 Risk reversals for one-month euro/dollar options are still
showing a solid bias for ""puts"" this year, though the currency
has rallied 8 percent so far in 2011.

 Inflation data, meanwhile, could potentially sway currency
sentiment this week, with Germany, Spain, Hungary, Sweden and
the United Kingdom all releasing reports on Tuesday. In the
United States, inflation data will be released on Thursday and
Friday.
 Currency traders have also started to talk about U.S.
government debt hitting its limit in a month's time, a scenario
that should renew pressure on the dollar.
 The United States is $95 billion away from reaching the
statutory $14.3 trillion ceiling, according to the latest
data.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent at 122.10 yen 
after trading as high as 123.33 yen earlier on trading platform
EBS. The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at 89.15 yen
, having scaled a high of 90.04 yen, its strongest
since September 2008.
 Technical indicators also suggested that the euro and
Australian dollar are in overbought territory against the yen,
pointing to the possibility of a near-term pull-back.

has rallied 8 percent so far in 2011.

 Inflation data, meanwhile, could potentially sway currency
sentiment this week, with Germany, Spain, Hungary, Sweden and
the United Kingdom all releasing reports on Tuesday. In the
United States, inflation data will be released on Thursday and
Friday.
 DOLLAR WEIGHED BY DEBT CEILING
 Currency traders have also started to talk about the U.S.
government debt hitting its limit in a month's time, a scenario
which should renew pressure on the dollar.
 ""We're having some sort of relief rally after the U.S.
government did not shut down as feared,"" said David Watt,
senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
""But I think gains in the dollar will be limited because the
focus will be on the U.S. debt limit.""
 The United States is $95 billion away from reaching the
statutory $14.3 trillion ceiling, according to the latest
data.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro  fell
0.2 percent to $1.4442, after hitting a 15-month high around
$1.4486 on Friday. The high on electronic trading platform EBS
was $1.4485.
 The yen, meanwhile, was off an 11-month low against the
euro and a 2-1/2-year trough versus the Australian dollar as
yet another earthquake in Japan led some investors to pare
bearish bets against the country's currency.
 A fresh strong aftershock hit Japan on Monday, while the
evacuation zone around its crippled nuclear plant was expanded
because of high levels of radiation. For more see
[ID:nL3E7FA058].
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at 122.24 yen ,
after trading as high as 123.33 yen earlier on trading platform
EBS. The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at 89.15 yen
, having scaled a high of 90.04 yen, its strongest
since September 2008.
 Technical indicators such as the 14-day relative strength
index and slow stochastics also suggested that the euro and
Australian dollar are in overbought territory against the yen,
pointing to the possibility of a near-term pull-back.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2011 02:24PM ET</span>","WITNESS-My aunt, and the lure of the Brazilian real"," By Brian Winter
 SAO PAULO, April 11 (Reuters) - I haven't seen my Aunt
Thelma in about 15 years, so imagine my surprise when an email
rolled in on Sunday with the subject line: ""Brazilian real.""
 ""I am considering investing a small amount in the carry
trade,"" the email began. And my first thought was: Wow, if
65-year-old retired insurance adjusters in Pottsboro, Texas, are
buying in now, how much longer until this bubble pops?
 Sure enough, Aunt Thelma's email was like a case study on
why Brazil's currency has appreciated 50 percent since 2009,
and 5 percent in just the last two weeks. She wants to use U.S.
dollars to borrow yen and then set up a short-term account in
Brazilian currency, reaping yields that are far beyond anything
to be had these days in the developed world.
 ""I hear about a 12-13 percent interest rate in Brazil,"" she
wrote. ""Any particular caveats for me to be aware of?""
 Now, Aunt Thelma (not her real name) is pretty savvy with
money -- certainly better than her nephew who, after all, chose
a career in journalism. And there are all kinds of economists
and other Wall Street folks out there who would tell her that
the real, currently trading at about 1.57 per dollar, is headed
next for the 1.50 threshold -- due to a nonstop torrent of dollar
inflows from yield-hungry investors just like her.
 Yet as somebody who actually lives in Brazil, I see reasons
for caution virtually every day. Indeed, some experts warn that
-- to use a phrase from my home state that Aunt Thelma would
understand -- this dog won't hunt for much longer.
 For one thing, some prices in Brazil have lost any anchor
with reality. The Big Mac, that handy barometer of
international prices, now goes for $6.20 in Sao Paulo --
compared to $3.56 at a McDonald's in North Texas. (Thanks for
checking, Mom.) Rent for a three-bedroom apartment can easily
set you back $3,500 a month. Executive pay is now higher than
in New York or London.
 The situation is such that Goldman Sachs christened the
real the world's most overvalued major currency -- and that was
last year, before the government decided to give in to an even
stronger currency, and back when I could afford to take my kids
out for more than just cheeseburgers.
 CONDOS IN FLORIDA, AND THE BRAZILIAN REAL
 The currency's strength is in part a product of something
very real -- Brazil's bona-fide emergence during the past
decade as a major economic power and a relatively safe place to
invest. In fact, Brazil's economy is so robust that it came
through the 2008 global crisis largely unscathed, which is one
reason why it's attracting so much ""hot money"" now.
 Some economists argue the real will remain strong at least
until the U.S. Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates --
and maybe longer, given Brazil's popularity among investors as
it prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.
 But didn't the 2008 crisis also teach us that, when prices
for something patently don't make sense, that's usually a
pretty sure sign of a bubble? That is, if million-dollar
McMansions in the middle of the Arizona desert were completely
insane in retrospect, then what to make of paying nearly
$50,000 for a simple new four-door Hyundai sedan in Brazil?
 Then there is the matter of the Aunt Thelmas of the world.
Virtually every financial bubble in history has been followed
by accounts of the retail investors who got suckered in just as
the game was up. When I covered the Argentine financial crisis
of 2001, it was the poor Italian pensioners who got stuck with
the worthless government bonds. My Texan friends who bought a
Miami condo ""as an investment"" in 2007 ... well, they spend a
lot of time in Florida these days.
 So what did I tell her? I explained that Brazilian assets
in general looked solid, as strong economic growth is expected
for years to come, but looking at the analysis from a number of
market strategists, she might be late to the game for a pure
speculative play on rates and currency.
 I also added the following caveat: Be wary of financial
advice from anybody who was short-sighted enough to accept a
job in Brazil that pays 100 percent in U.S. dollars!

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell
sharply on Monday after surging last week as investors warily
eyed efforts to halt Libya's conflict, while the dollar rose
against the euro after the U.S. government averted a potential
shutdown.
 U.S. stocks pared early gains to trade little changed, with
investors nervously awaiting companies' quarterly results to
see if earnings would be strong enough to spark further gains
in equities.
 Aluminum maker Alcoa  will mark the unofficial start
of the quarterly earnings season when it reports results after
the market's close on Monday. Profits for S&P 500 companies are
seen rising 11.4 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson
Reuters data. See [ID:nN07256466]
 ""There's a question of whether companies can meet the
fairly optimistic expectations,"" said John Carey, portfolio
manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston, which has
about $260 billion in assets under management. ""There's
potential for disappointment, but if they come in line or
above, the market could experience a continued rally.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 5.11 points,
or 0.04 percent, at 12,383.72. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 2.77 points, or 0.21 percent, at 1,325.45. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was off 10.54 points, or 0.38
percent, at 2769.70.
 ICE Brent crude for May  was last down $2.06 at
$124.59 a barrel. U.S. crude for May delivery  fell $2.39
cents to $110.39 a barrel. U.S. crude fell further after
long-term commodity bull Goldman Sachs  recommended
clients take profits after recent 30-month highs.
 The African Union said Muammar Gaddafi had accepted a road
map to end the civil war, but forces loyal to him shelled the
town of Misrata. A broker said oil also fell on profit-taking.
For details, see [ID:nL3E7FB0Z5]
 Analysts were skeptical about the peace deal. And even if
an end to the civil war is in sight, it will be some time
before Libyan exports return to pre-conflict levels.
 ""Some of Libya's oil fields, which have recently come under
attack, have suffered severe damage, which is likely to have a
long-lasting negative impact on the country's production
profile,"" said Amrita Sen at Barclays Capital. ""We don't
believe there is reason to be optimistic even if Gaddafi were
to step down, as the power vacuum would be very large.""
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.3 percent, with emerging markets <.MSCIEF> off 0.5 percent.
European stocks fell, with the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index
of top European shares down 0.2 percent.
 Although the world economy is fairly robust, investors
increasingly expect higher commodity prices to drive up
inflation, prompting central banks to tighten monetary policy
sooner.
 The International Monetary Fund said on Monday it did not
believe that rising commodity prices will derail the global
economic recovery but warned inflation will remain elevated for
a while.
 GREENBACK GAINS LIMITED
 The dollar rose against the euro after the U.S. Congress on
Friday reached a last-minute budget deal that avoided a
government shutdown, though traders said the focus on the U.S.
debt ceiling debate could limit any gains.
 A rebound in the dollar was also overdue after it fell
against the euro for the past four months. For the month of
April, the dollar was still down more than 2 percent.
 The euro  fell 0.3 percent to $1.4440, after hitting
a 15-month high around $1.4486 last Friday. The high on
electronic trading platform EBS was $1.4485.
 ""We're having some sort of relief rally after the U.S.
government did not shut down as feared,"" said David Watt,
senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 The yen was off an 11-month low against the euro and a
2-1/2-year trough versus the Australian dollar as another
earthquake in Japan led some investors to close riskier bets
funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency.
[ID:nL3E7FA058]
 The strong aftershock in Japan unnerved some investors,
driving down copper prices after they earlier reached five-week
highs on a weaker dollar and robust imports by top consumer
China.
 The euro touched its highest against the yen since May 2010
of 123.33 yen  on trading platform EBS. It later gave
up gains and was last down 0.5 percent at 122.07 yen.
 Expectations of another rise in European Central Bank
interest rates by July kept the euro close to recent highs and
pushed euro zone government bond prices lower. German Bund
yields  briefly rose above 3.5 percent for the
first time since August 2009.

 * Difficult talks ahead on U.S. worker retraining aid
(Adds quote, background throughout)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - The White House could send
a free trade pact with Colombia to Congress for approval within
weeks now that a bilateral agreement on labor concerns has been
reached, a top U.S. official said on Monday.
 However, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Miriam Sapiro
said the exact timing would depend on talks with Congress on
other trade priorities, which include securing assistance for
vulnerable U.S. workers and smoothing trade with Russia.
 ""The Colombia agreement could be ready in a matter of
weeks, but we will not leave the other important pieces of our
trade agenda behind,"" Sapiro said in a speech.
 Talks with Congress could include potentially difficult
negotiations over the future of retraining benefits for U.S.
workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition.
 Congress approved an expansion of the Trade Adjustment
Assistance program in early 2009, but it recently expired after
many House Republicans objected to its costs. With lawmakers
battling over budgets, reviving the benefits could be tough.
 ""We're having a conversation with congressional leadership
over how to sequence all of our trade priorities because we
don't want to leave any single one behind,"" Sapiro told
reporters after the speech.
 Many lawmakers in both parties also are wary of granting
Russia what is known as ""permanent normal trade relations""
status until there is a final international agreement to let
the country into the World Trade Organization.
 That WTO deal could take months or longer. Normalising
trade ties would ensure that Russian products receive the most
favorable U.S. tariff rates and that Russia further opens its
market to American exports when it joins the WTO.
 The White House also wants to ensure the renewal of two
other recently-expired programs, the Andean Trade Preferences
Act and the Generalized System of Preferences that give poorer
countries duty-free access to the United States.
 While the Obama administration has supported trade as an
engine of economic recovery, some Democratic lawmakers have
resisted moves that could erode U.S. jobs by allowing in cheap
imports, slowing down the process of agreeing to deals.
 Republicans, who won control of the House of
Representatives in last November's election, have been pushing
for action by July on the Colombia agreement as well as trade
pacts with South Korea and Panama.
 All three were signed during the administration of
President George W. Bush, who was unable to win approval for
the deals from the Democratic-controlled Congress.
 Last week, the United States and Colombia announced a
three-stage labor ""action plan"" to address concerns about
workers rights, anti-union violence and criminal impunity in
the Latin American country.
 ""Some of these actions will be taken before we move the FTA
forward, in fact as soon as April 22, while others will be
taken before Congress votes on the agreement or before entry
into force,"" Sapiro said.
 The Colombian labor agreement followed a deal struck with
South Korea in December to renegotiate provisions of the pact
that U.S. automakers had complained favored their Asian
competitors too much.
 Sapiro said she expected more ""good news"" from Panama,
where that country's National Assembly is expected to soon
approve a tax information treaty that would clear the way for
the White House to send that deal to Congress.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2011 12:40PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Iran's oil trade under sanctions regime," LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Iran has manoeuvred around
sanctions for decades, but the task has become more complicated
since Western powers introduced new measures in the middle of
last year that specifically targeted oil and gas trade. 
 No sanctions, however, are water-tight.
 The following is an update of Iran's response to them. 
 
 GASOLINE
 Iran is OPEC's second-biggest crude producer after Saudi
Arabia, but its inadequate refinery infrastructure made it an
importer of gasoline.
 After last year's wave of sanctions scared off many of
Iran's regular suppliers, the country took measures that it said
made it self-sufficient in gasoline, and it has even exported
some cargoes. 
 The Islamic Republic plans to sell around 30,000-50,000
tonnes of gasoline in April to foreign customers, with the bulk
going to neighbouring Afghanistan and other poor countries,
trade sources said on Monday.
 Analysts and traders agree gasoline imports have fallen
drastically but say some shipments from friendly powers, such as
China, Venezuela and Russia, have got through.
 Industry sources have said Iran was importing 150,000 tonnes
per month, compared with 450,000 tonnes before. A standard cargo
is around 33,000 tonnes (280,000 barrels).
 Demand has fallen in Iran as subsidies have been reduced,
meaning prices for gasoline have increased, but traders said
Iran was still not able to import as much as it needed.
 
 CRUDE SALES 
 Iran has also been selling unrefined oil. As Italy, which is
heavily dependent on imported fuel, stayed loyal, its oil
imports from Iran rose by 80.6 percent in 2010, an industry
group said earlier this month. 
 Disruption of Libyan exports because of violent unrest in
the OPEC member country also provided an opportunity for Iran to
sell some of the crude that had built up in floating storage. 
Shipping sources said last week Iran was storing crude oil at
sea on at 12 very large crude carriers (VLCCs), which can hold a
maximum of 24 million barrels. Separately, broker E.A. Gibson
said on Friday Iran was using 16 VLCCs to store crude at sea.
 A further 12 million barrels of crude oil was being held in
shorter-term storage involving shuttle transits to the Red Sea
oil terminal of Sidi Kerir, shipping sources said. That compares
with a peak of up to 25 tankers, mostly VLCCs, last year, which
was the highest build up of Iranian crude at seas since 2008. 
 
 INDIA/IRAN 
 After Saudi Arabia, Iran is the second-biggest oil supplier
to India, providing it with around 400,000 barrels per day. 
India's central bank said in December payments to Iran could
no longer be settled using a clearing system run by regional
central banks. Early this week, Germany agreed to help India
make payments for Iranian oil, a newspaper reported on Monday.
 
 HOW THE SANCTIONS ARE BYPASSED? 
 The biggest problem for traders is that financial
transactions with Iran even for very small amounts require
authorisation. Traders said any company dealing with Iran
struggled to obtain letters of credit, needed to guarantee
transactions, so cash transfers were easier. Alternatively, some
Asian banks and smaller banks in the Middle East were willing to
run the risk of providing guarantees. 
 Often, Iranian cargoes are shipped in vessels chartered by
front companies. 
 As further possible cover, the final destination is not
necessarily that shown on shipping documents. 
 ""It is usually the trading companies who charter the vessel.
They tell the ship owner where it will go and once they sail,
they can easily change the destination,"" one ship broker based
in the Gulf said. 
 Lawyers said they had been approached by trading companies
asking how they could continue to trade legally.

 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on
Monday on optimism over upcoming corporate earnings, while
crude oil prices retreated after a recent run-up as investors
eyed efforts to broker an end to Libya's civil war.
 Aluminum maker Alcoa  will mark the unofficial start
of the quarterly earnings season when it reports results after
the market's close on Monday. Profits for S&P 500 companies are
seen rising 11.4 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson
Reuters data. See [ID:nN07256466]
 The dollar rebounded against the euro after steep losses on
Friday, as the U.S. government averted a potential shutdown,
although the focus on the debt ceiling debate could limit the
greenback's gains.
 ""The major companies reporting this week will give us a
nice slice of what to expect this season, and if we get
follow-through in the results, this could be the catalyst that
finally gets more people back in the market,"" said Mike Shea,
managing partner and trader at Direct Access Partners LLC in
New York.
 Alcoa, a Dow component, rose 0.7 percent to $18.05. The
company is seen posting growth in both earnings and revenue.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 54.57
points, or 0.44 percent, at 12,434.90. The Standard & Poor's

 Brent crude oil earlier fell by more than $1 to below $125
before retracing some of its losses and moving above $126 a
barrel. U.S. crude futures slipped under $112, giving back some
ground after Friday's strong rally.

map to end the civil war, but forces loyal to him shelled the
town of Misrata. A broker said oil also fell on profit-taking.

 Analysts were skeptical about the peace deal.
 ""We have seen such peace plans before,"" said Carsten

 The dollar rose against the euro after the U.S. Congress on
Friday reached a last-minute budget deal that avoided a
government shut-down. A rally in the dollar was also overdue
after having been sold off versus the euro for the last four

against the country's currency.
 A strong aftershock hit Japan on Monday, while the

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded against
the euro on Monday after steep losses on Friday as the U.S.
government averted a potential shutdown, although the focus on
the debt ceiling debate could limit the greenback's gains.
 A rally in the dollar was also overdue after having been
sold off versus the euro for the last four months. So far in
April the dollar is still down more than 2 percent.
 Currency traders have also started to talk about the U.S.
government debt hitting its limit in a month's time, a scenario
which should renew pressure on the dollar.
 Expectations the Federal Reserve will lag other major
central banks such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of
England in raising interest rates could also undermine the U.S.
currency.
 ""We're having some sort of relief rally after the U.S.
government did not shut down as feared,"" said David Watt,
senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""But I think gains in the dollar will be limited because
the focus will be on the U.S. debt limit.""
 The United States is $95 billion away from reaching the
statutory $14.3 trillion ceiling, according to the latest data.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has asked Congress to
raise that limit and failure to do so in a timely way would
push interest rates higher and spark a ""financial crisis
potentially more severe than the crisis from which we are only
starting to recover.""
 In midday New York trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent to
$1.4437, after hitting a fresh 15-month high around $1.4486
last Friday. The high on electronic trading platform EBS was
$1.4485.
 But interest rate differentials between Europe and the
United States, after last week's 25-basis-point increase by the
ECB, were expected to continue to support the euro.
 Euro zone-U.S. rate differentials widened to about 156
basis points on Monday, based on the March 2012 Euribor and
Eurodollar contracts.
 ""With the ECB now in tightening mode, even if it is a
gradualist approach and the Fed is still supplying more
liquidity via its asset purchase program, the fundamental case
for recent and future EUR/USD gains is pretty compelling,"" said
Bob Lynch, currency strategist at HSBC in New York.
 In addition, he said investors have largely become
dismissive of the occasional hawkish rhetoric coming from some
Fed officials. They're sensing that the doves on the FOMC, led
by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Fed Vice-chair Janet Yellen
are the dominant and more important voices to consider when
forecasting future monetary policy, Lynch said.
 Some analysts like RBC's Watt, however, remained
unconvinced about the euro's rally, especially after Portugal
last week sought financial aid from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund.
 Analysts said rate hikes by the ECB could hurt fiscally
weak peripheral nations such as Spain, in terms of higher bank
funding and mortgage costs.
 YEN OFF ITS LOWS
 The yen, meanwhile, was off an 11-month low against the
euro and a 2-1/2-year trough versus the Australian dollar as
yet another earthquake in Japan led some investors to pare
bearish bets against the country's currency.
 A fresh strong aftershock hit Japan on Monday, while the
evacuation zone around its crippled nuclear plant was expanded
because of high levels of radiation.
 Traders said speculator positioning and some technical
indicators suggested that rallies in the euro and Australian
dollar against the yen could pause in the short run, with the

 * EU/U.S. spread narrows as monetary policy cycles diverge
 * Portuguese yields steady awaiting bailout deal terms
 By William James
 LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Germany's cost of borrowing
over 10 years topped 3.5 percent for the first time since August
2009 on Monday and was set to rise further as expectations of
higher euro zone interest rates drove yields higher across the
curve.
 The European Central Bank has pointed markets towards
further rises in rates this year after last Thursday's 25 basis
point increase, prompting investors to skew their positions
towards a next rise coming in June rather than July.
 ""It is very much a macro story that is driving the Bund
market now... it's now a story about the ECB, inflation and core
European macroeconomic performance,"" said Niels From, chief
analyst at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The Schatz yield  -- the most sensitive to
changes in interest rates -- hit its highest since December 2008
at 1.944 percent while 10-year Bund yields  were
1.5 basis points higher on the day at 3.505 percent.
 Bund futures  settled 14 ticks lower at 119.90.
 Moves on the day were small but German yields have been on a
rising trend after bouncing off the 38 percent retracement level
of the 2008-2010 fall at 3.1 percent in mid-March, and the next
target is the 62 percent retracement around 3.7 percent.
 DZ Bank strategist Glenn Marci expects Bunds to yield 3.8
percent at the end of this year and 4 percent by next April,
with Treasury yields at 4 percent at the end of the year and 4.3
percent in 12-months.
 U.S. Treasuries outperformed Bunds, with the yield spread
  down 40 bps from early-February to
below 10 bps -- a level breached seven times in the past six
months and each time followed by a swift rebound.
 Donal O'Mahony, global strategist at Davy Stockbrokers said
the recent weakening of Bunds versus Treasuries may reverse in
the second part of the year as Federal Reserve officials turn
more hawkish, and comments following the Fed's April meeting may
offer the first signs of that shift.
 ""As we move through the year you will see Fed policymakers
becoming more hawkish and that perhaps ... is when
cross-Atlantic spreads will be widening again,"" O'Mahony said.
 
 BAILOUT
 Portuguese bond yields were steady as officials from the
European Commission, the ECB and the IMF readied for talks in
Lisbon on Tuesday over the details of the country's bailout.
 Traders said Portuguese debt was likely to trade sideways
until the conditions of the aid deal -- key to assessing
Portugal's long-term viability as an investment -- are known.
 Greek bond yields were steady despite media reports that
finance ministers believed Greece was unlikely to meet fiscal
targets, but traders said tensions could resume if talk about
restructuring intensified.
 ""They are stating the obvious, but restructuring is not
something you would want to hear even if many already expect
significant haircuts,"" a trader said.
 By assuming investors will recover 40 percent of their
original investment, Davy Stockbrokers' Donal O'Mahony says the
market is pricing in a 61 percent probability of a default based
on three-year CDS levels -- currently at around 1,220 bps.
 The annual cost of insuring 10 million euros worth of debt
over three years would be 1.22 million euros. This means
investors are paying an insurance rate of 61 percent to protect
against expected losses of 6 million euros.

 * Significant two-way risks around baseline CPI scenario
 * Weak household demand may allow rate cut in longer run
 
 By Krisztina Than and Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, April 11 (Reuters) - Hungary's key base rate must
stay at its current level for some time for the central bank to
achieve its inflation target in 2012, but weak household demand
may allow a rate cut in the longer run, Deputy Governor Ferenc
Karvalits said.
 Karvalits told Reuters on Monday that there were significant
two-sided risks around the baseline scenario in the bank's March
inflation report, which -- if they materialise -- may
necessitate further tightening or even create room for a rate
reduction in the longer term.
 The bank (NBH) kept its benchmark interest rate steady at 6
percent in the past two months, after three successive rate
hikes between November and January.
 Karvalits said that if the assumptions of the baseline
scenario are met, the bank would achieve its 3 percent inflation
target in the second half of 2012.
 ""This however means that the current interest rate level
needs to be maintained for an extended period for us to be able
to achieve the inflation target,"" he said in an interview.
 Karvalits said external cost shocks had been much stronger
than the bank had expected, but the pass-through of these had
been weak. But it could not be excluded that as domestic demand
picks up, the pass-through impact might strengthen.
 ""If this happens, that could necessitate monetary
tightening,"" Karvalits said.
 But he said he personally assigned a significant likelihood
to another risk scenario of continued sluggish household demand
-- helping disinflation and possibly opening the room for rate
cuts in the longer horizon.
 ""The negative credit flow in the household sector can result
in a weaker rebound in domestic demand than we assumed in the
baseline scenario and this may contribute to a robust
disinflationary process, but we will not see this for certain in
the next one or two months,"" he said.
 ""This is a trend unfolding on a longer horizon. In the near
term this will not have an impact on our thinking. However, in
the longer term, it may result in monetary easing taking place
sooner than otherwise. But not tomorrow.""
 At its March meeting, there was an indication of a new tone
to the Council's statement in its raising of the possibility of
a rate cut in the medium term.
 Analysts in the last Reuters poll expected the base rate to
remain on hold at 6 percent until the end of 2011 and decrease
to 5.5 percent by the end of next year.
 
 HARMONY
 When asked if he could see divisions in the new-look
Monetary Council, in which the four delegates of the ruling
Fidesz party were now in a majority, Karvalits said the Council
decided on rates in March in ""perfect harmony"".
 He said the members of the rate-setting body shared the
baseline scenario, and views within the Council did not diverge
to an extent which would have led to a debate of the main
message -- rates staying on hold for an extended period.
 Markets had been watching for any signs of a division
between the existing members of the council and the new
appointees -- who may be more inclined to support government
calls for action to boost liquidity in the economy.
 Karvalits said the Council did not discuss any
unconventional tools of policy at its meeting in March. The
country's governing majority will rewrite the National Bank's
rules by the end of this year in a move analysts say could
include sensitive areas but was not likely to threaten the
bank's independence.
 When asked if the strengthening of the forint since the
March rate meeting to around 264-265 from 268, if continued,
could create scope for monetary easing, he said:
 ""The central bank does not want to comment on short-term
exchange rate movements. We react to lasting changes in monetary
conditions.""

 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on
Monday on hopes for strong earnings, while crude oil prices
retreated on signs of progress in Libyan peace talks.
 The African Union said Muammar Gaddafi had accepted a
roadmap to end the civil war, but forces loyal to him shelled
the town of Misrata. A broker said oil also fell on

 The yen rebounded from an 11-month low against the euro and
a 2-1/2 year trough versus the Australian dollar, after the
latest earthquake, with a magnitude 6.6, prompted some
investors to unwind riskier bets often funded by cheap
borrowing in the Japanese currency.
 ""The good news for bulls as we enter earnings season is
that expectations appear to be low,"" said Todd Salamone, senior
vice president of research at Schaeffer's Investment Research
in Cincinnati, Ohio.

 Although the world economy is fairly robust, there are
growing expectations among investors that accompanying higher
commodity prices will drive up inflation and prompt central
banks to tighten monetary policy sooner.
 The International Monetary Fund said on Monday it did not
believe that rising commodity prices will derail the global
economic recovery, but warned inflation will remain elevated
for a while.
 Brent crude oil earlier fell by more than $1 to below $125
but has since retraced some of its losses moving above $126 a

 By Amena Bakr and Luke Pachymuthu
 DUBAI/SINGAPORE, April 1 (Reuters) - Iran plans to sell
around 30,000-50,000 tonnes of gasoline to foreign customers in
April, traders told Reuters on Monday.
 Iran, the world's fifth-largest crude oil exporter,
previously imported around 40 percent of its gasoline needs due
to inadequate domestic refining capacity.
 Cuts in gasoline subsidies have also curbed consumption.
 ""The issue is Iran's gasoline is still low quality, and the
only buyers will be from developing countries that are looking
for cheap fuel,"" said one Gulf-based trader, who added that
since mid-March Iran had been looking for buyers.
 International sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear
program have made it more difficult for Tehran to do business
with international oil companies. 
 Traders say the bulk of the gasoline Iran will export this
month will go to neighbouring Afghanistan and other poor
countries.
 ""These volumes have been on the table since last month, but
it would be interesting to see how much of that actually reaches
the buyers,"" the Gulf-based trader added.
 During the first three months of this year Iran imported
only three cargoes of gasoline, traders said.
 ""Iran does not need to import anymore. We are self
sufficient and don't have the risk of being short on supplies,""
said a source at the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC).
 ""The exports will continue even over the summer, when we
have very high demand,"" the NIOC source added. 
 Iran traditionally imported between 11-13 cargos a month
during the summer holiday driving season.
 ""This has changed now, Iran has upgraded its facilities and
has the capacity to meet its own demand in addition to producing
excess which is now being exported,"" Mohammed Ali Khatibi,
Iran's OPEC governor told Reuters.

 (Adds comment, background, updates news and price)
 By David Brough and Sarah McFarlane
 LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - The arrest of Ivory Coast
leader Laurent Gbagbo and the lifting of European Union
sanctions on the two main ports of the top cocoa producer mean
cocoa exports may be possible by next week, dealers said.
 Exports of stocks held at Abidjan and San Pedro should start
quite quickly as the ports are secure, cocoa dealers said.
 ""We just need to get machinery back in there to move the
containers around, which should take a week, and then get
vessels booked and moved in,"" a dealer at an international trade
house said, adding that purchasing cocoa could be trickier.
 ""The general process of buying cocoa would be difficult
because you need cash on the ground. The supply chain for
getting bush cocoa down to the port is going to be disrupted,""
said the dealer.
 A unit of Danish shipping and oil group A.P Moller-Maersk
hopes to make its first call to Abidjan on Wednesday to collect
cargo including cocoa since EU sanctions were lifted, the
company said on Monday.
 The EU lifted sanctions on Friday on Abidjan and San Pedro
as well as on the Ivorian Refining Company and the Coffee and
Cocoa Trade Management Committee, following a request from
presidential claimant Alassane Ouattara.
 Meanwhile, French special forces have detained Gbagbo and
handed him to leaders of the opposition under Alassane Outtara,
after French tanks forced their way into his residence, a Gbagbo
adviser in France said on Monday.
 
 MID CROP
 The EU sanctions, an export ban imposed by Ouattara and a
crippled banking system have halted activity in Ivory Coast's
cocoa industry in recent months.
 ""The EU statement is a step in the right direction for the
cocoa trade,"" said Jonathan Parkman, joint head of agriculture
at brokerage Marex Financial.
 One physical cocoa trader said the EU's move was a welcome
step towards resuming normal trade patterns but added, ""A formal
lifting of the export ban is now needed and a stop to fighting.""
 Dealers and analysts said that while exports may resume in
the near term, concerns remained about the coming mid-crop.
 Gary Mead, an analyst at VM Group, said, ""The real question
is -- what will be the fate of the Ivorian mid crop? All the
time fighting and bloodshed and uncertainty continue, that (mid
crop) has a shadow hanging over it. Longer term -- out to the
2011/12 season -- there are even more doubts.""
 Ivory Coast's mid-crop harvest starts this month. Many cocoa
farmers have fled due to violence in the country.
 The resumption of trade will also depend on restoring the
country's crippled banking system.
 ""Without the banking system, it's hard to see how trade will
resume,"" Parkman said.
 ICE July cocoa futures was up $26, or 0.9 percent, at $3,011
a tonne at 1326 GMT. They earlier peaked at $3,079 a tonne, up
over 3 percent, which compared with a 32-year high of $3,775 per
tonne on March 4.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded on
Monday after steep losses on Friday, as the U.S. government
averted a potential shutdown, although the focus on the debt
ceiling debate could limit the greenback's gains.
 Currency traders have started to talk about the U.S.
government debt hitting its limit in a month's time, a scenario
which should renew pressure on the dollar.
 Expectations the Federal Reserve will lag other major
central banks such as the European Central Bank and Bank of
England in raising interest rates could also undermine the U.S.
currency.
 ""We're having some sort of relief rally after the U.S.
government did not shut down as feared,"" said David Watt,
senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""But I think gains in the dollar will be limited because
the focus will be on the U.S. debt limit.""
 The United States is $95 billion away from reaching the
statutory $14.3 trillion ceiling, according to the latest data.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has asked Congress to
raise that limit and failure to do so in a timely way would
push interest rates higher and spark a ""financial crisis
potentially more severe than the crisis from which we are only
starting to recover.""
 In early New York trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent at
$1.4431, after hitting a fresh 15-month high around $1.4486
last Friday. The high on electronic trading platform EBS was
$1.4485.
 But interest rate differentials between Europe and the
United States, after last week's 25 basis point increase by the
European Central Bank, were expected to continue to support the
euro.
 ""The ECB hike and subsequent press conference did not bring
many surprises, but the sustained upward pressure on EUR/USD
suggests that net long positions may have been built further
since,"" Danske Bank said in a note.
 However, some analysts like RBC's Watt remained unconvinced
by the euro's rally, especially after Portugal last week sought
financial aid from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund.
 Analysts said interest rate increases by the ECB could hurt
fiscally-weak peripheral countries such as Spain, in terms of
higher bank funding and higher mortgage rate for the broader
economy.
 ""So you're looking at the euro, and it's at $1.44. You sort
of ask whether that is a level that makes sense given that the
EU periphery issues have not gone away,"" said RBC's Watt.
 YEN OFF ITS LOWS
 The yen, meanwhile, was off an 11-month low against the
euro and a 2-1/2 year trough versus the Australian dollar on
Monday, as another earthquake in Japan led some investors to
pare bearish bets against the country's currency.
 A fresh strong aftershock hit Japan on Monday, while the
evacuation zone around its crippled nuclear plant was expanded
because of high levels of accumulated radiation.
 Traders said speculator positioning and some technical
indicators suggested that rallies in the euro and the
Australian dollar against the yen could pause in the short run,
with the latest in a series of quakes being used by some to
book profits.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent at 122.06 yen, well below its
highest since May 2010 of 123.33 yen hit earlier on trading
platform EBS. The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at
89.17 yen, having scaled a high of 90.04 yen earlier, its
strongest since September 2008.
 Technical indicators such as the 14-day relative strength
index and slow stochastics also suggested that the euro and
Australian dollar are in overbought territory against the yen,
pointing to the possibility of a near-term pull-back.

 TRNAVA, Slovakia, April 11 (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen
will invest 130 million euros ($188 million) at its Slovak
assembly plant to add a new model, the company's chief executive
officer said on Monday.
 PSA Peugeot Citroen Chief Executive Philippe Varin said the
car maker would also add around 900 new jobs to the 3,000-strong
workforce at the factory, located in the western Slovak town of
Trnava.
 Company officials, however, did not give any details about
the new model, which is expected to go into mass production next
year.
 PSA, which is among the Slovakia's top exporters and major
employers, made 187,000 cars last year, compared with 203,800 in
2009. The assembly plant's annual production capacity is 300,000
cars, but has not been running at full speed.
 The Slovak site currently makes some Peugeot 207s as well as
the Citroen C3 Picasso.
 PSA Peugeot Citroen reduced production last month at some
European sites due to cuts in supplies from its key Japanese
partner Hitachi.
 Varin said production at the French car group's factories
was returning to normal, but it could face further disruptions
in the future.
 ""Situation is getting back to normal, but there is still
some uncertainty. It is possible there will be further
disruptions in supplies, but it is hard to foresee them today,""
Varin told reporters.

 By Marcin Goettig
 WARSAW, April 11 (Reuters) - The June revision of Polish
balance of payments data for 2010 will involve an increase in
the current account deficit of at least one percent of gross
domestic product, a central bank official said on Monday.
 But Jozef Sobota, who heads the bank's statistics
department, said the revision was unlikely to affect the GDP
data that is at the heart of market concerns around the data,
echoing previous reassurances from Governor Marek Belka.
 Poland's current account deficit stood at 3.4 pct of GDP
last year, latest data show, but the 'errors and omissions'
category in the balance of payments accounted for 3.7 pct of
GDP, leaving markets jittery over the true size of the gap.
 The bank's revision will entail incorporating a more precise
estimate of private car imports and also the size of cash
tranfers of individuals to Poland, Sobota told Reuters.
 ""Imports of second-hand cars could limit the errors and
omissions balance by around 20 percent. Imports would then grow
and the current account deficit rise by this amount. It should
not, however, change the GDP figure for last year,"" Sobota said.
 ""We can estimate that a related correction will increase the
C/A deficit by around 1 pct of GDP for 2010,"" he added.
 The bank also has enough data now to expect a cut in the
value of private transfers to Poland, which would further
increase the C/A gap at the expense of errors and omissions,
Sobota said.
 
 IMPORTS FROM GERMANY
 Markets were set on edge at the end of March when an adviser
to Belka said errors and omissions in the 2010 balance of
payments could be due to underestimated imports from Germany,
Poland's key trade partner. [ID:nSLALEE7RH]
 The figures were later explained by the statistics office as
resulting from different treatment of exports and imports under
international accounting rules. But the adviser's comments
spooked investors, who feared such a gap could lower past growth
figures and increase reported debt to GDP, triggering severe
budget spending cuts under Polish law. [ID:nLDE72O0E6]
 Poland's economy, the largest in the European Union's
eastern wing, grew by 3.8 percent last year, up from 1.7 percent
in 2009 when it was the only state in the EU to avoid recession.
 In efforts to make its balance of payments data more
precise, the central bank is working on a better assessment of
assets held by foreigners living in Poland as well as the value
of cash they send outside the country, Sobota said.
 With errors and omissions accounting for 8 percent of
turnover on its current account, Poland is among EU members with
higher-than-average ratios, Sobota said.
 ""However, Sweden, Finland and France have higher ratios. In
our region Bulgaria has a higher ratio,"" Sobota said.
 ""We are able to significantly correct the current ratio so
that it comes close to the median for other EU countries, that
is between three and four percent,"" he added.

 * When: Consensus South Asian monsoon forecast on April 15
 * Where: Pune, India

 By Krittivas Mukherjee and Ratnajyoti Dutta	
 NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - Global experts meeting this
week are likely to forecast a near-normal monsoon for India,
providing international commodities market the first hints of
demand and supply in 2011/12 from one of the world's top
producers and consumers of key farm goods.	
 Failure of monsoons can force India into the international
markets as a buyer, pushing up global prices of basic
foodstuffs, while favourable rainfall can boost its exports,
helping governments throughout Asia to battle food inflation.	
 Agriculture accounts for a 14.6 percent of India's GDP and
the outcome of the annual June-September southwest monsoons
impacts the nation's economy, which is struggling with high food
inflation and a massive subsidy bill for fuel, grains and
fertilisers.	
 A normal monsoon means the country receives rainfall between
96-104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 centimetres during the
four-month rainy season, according to the India's weather office
classification.
    Monsoons also impact demand for gold in India, the world's
top consumer of the metal, as purchases get a boost when farming
incomes rise amid high crop output. Rural areas account for
about 70 percent of India's annual gold consumption.
    India witnessed normal rains last year and the April 13-15
meeting of weather officials in the southwestern city of Pune is
likely to forecast a near-normal monsoon this year based on
various forecasting models, Indian officials said.	
 ""The weakening phase of La Nina has given rise to the
expectation of a near-normal monsoon in 2011,"" said D. R. Sikka,
former director of the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical
Meteorology.	
 Other officials of the Indian weather office, who did not
wish to be identified, agreed. A La Nina weather pattern causes
heavier-than-normal rains in South Asia. After the weak phase,
the La Nina is expected to enter a neutral phase without posing
any threat to good rainfall during the monsoon season.	
 The Pune meeting will issue a consensus forecast for the
monsoon on the final day of the conference.	

    While India is mostly self-sufficient in staples like wheat
and rice for its 1.2 billion population, drought can push the
country into international markets as it did in 2009 when India
had to import sugar -- sending global prices to record highs.
    The government subsidises the price of key crops to contain
inflation and ensure half a billion poor -- many of whom spend
up to 60 percent of their incomes on food -- can afford to eat.
    The first official Indian forecast is not due until later
this month. During 2009, the driest monsoon in 37 years caused
widespread losses to key crops such as oilseeds and sugarcane,
pushing up food inflation and causing a political headache for
the government.   
   
    POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
    Monsoon forecasting in India is carried out by
government-backed organisations and has significant political
implications in a country where more than 60 percent of voters
are in rural communities and form the bulk of the government's
support base.
    Bad rainfall results in political pressure on the
government, as farmers demand higher rates for their produce and
ask bureaucrats to waive loan repayment and electricity charges,
impacting public finances.
    Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's ruling Congress government,
mired in a slew of corruption charges, has struggled with
double-digit food inflation for most of its second term in
office since 2009 when it won an election partly by boosting
farm incomes. In early 2010, India's food inflation went as high
as 22 percent on supply constraints.
    The government hopes monsoon rains -- which traverse the
subcontinent from its southern tip to the Himalayan north from
June through September -- would boost farm output and help
lower prices, potentially providing a timely political boost
ahead of key state elections.
    ""The budget, and the economy as a whole, it is said is a
gamble on the monsoon,"" Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a leading Indian
political columnist, told Reuters. ""The reason is simple --
roughly 60 percent of crop area in the country is rain-fed.""
   
    HIGHER EXPORTS
    Higher agricultural supplies triggered by normal rains could
encourage the Indian government to allow overseas sale of wheat
and lift export curbs on rice. 
 India faces a storage problem as the 2011 wheat harvest is
set to be a record, exceeding demand for a fifth straight year.
    ""The government can make a bold decision on grain exports.
It can tinker with policies if the monsoon shapes up on expected
lines,"" said Veeresh Hiremath, research head of the
Hyderabad-based broking Karvy Comtrade.
    Higher oilseed output last year helped India increase
oilmeals exports to traditional buyers in southeast Asia by more
than half to 5.1 million tonnes. [ID:nL3E7F815S]
    In most parts of India, the monsoon accounts for 75-90
percent of the total annual rainfall.
    The monsoon impacts other sectors of Asia's third largest
economy, as farmers spend their cash on cars, motorcycles and
consumer goods. Good rainfall reduces demand for diesel, used to
pump water from wells for irrigation when rainfall is scant.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - The yen was off an 11-month low
against the euro and a 2-1/2 year trough versus the Australian
dollar on Monday, as another earthquake in Japan led some
investors to pare bearish bets against the country's currency.
 Traders said speculator positioning and some technical
indicators suggested that rallies in the euro and the Australian
dollar against the yen could pause in the short run with the
latest in a series of quakes being used by some to book profits.
 With investors wary of taking on more risk, the euro also
dipped versus the dollar, staying below Friday's 15-month high
of $1.4489. Traders said an options expiry at $1.4450 was likely
to influence price action, keeping it close to that level.
 ""(The latest Japan earthquake) has put a cap on the risk-on
trade we saw earlier in the session. Equity futures are off
their highs and cross/yen positions are being pared back,"" said
Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets.
 The euro was down 0.25 percent at 122.40 yen , well
below its highest since May 2010 of 123.33 yen hit earlier on
trading platform EBS. The Australian dollar was down at 89.32
yen , having scaled a high of 90.04 yen earlier, its
strongest since September 2008.
 A fresh strong aftershock hit Japan on Monday, while the
evacuation zone around its crippled nuclear plant was expanded
because of high levels of accumulated radiation. [ID:nL3E7FA058]
 Against the dollar, the euro  was down 0.2 percent at
$1.4451. Some traders cited influence from the 21-hour moving
average around $1.4460.
 But the euro was expected to stay supported by interest rate
differentials after last week's 25 basis point hike by the
European Central Bank.
 ""The ECB hike and subsequent press conference did not bring
many surprises, but the sustained upward pressure on EUR/USD
suggests that net long positions may have been built further
since,"" Danske Bank said in a note.
 A number of Asian central banks were also said to have
intervened to prevent their currencies from rising, and traders
expected they may recycle those proceeds into the euro.
 
 SHORT YEN POSITIONS RIPE FOR PULLBACK
 Data from the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) showed speculators went net short on the yen for the
first time in six weeks and by the biggest margin since May 2010
at a net 43,231 contracts in the week to April 5. [IMM/FX]
 Technical indicators such as the 14-day relative strength
index and slow stochastics also suggested that the euro and
Australian dollar are in overbought territory against the yen,
pointing to the possibility of a near-term pull-back.
 Commerzbank technical analyst Karen Jones said near-term
support for euro/yen lay around the 121.55/60 yen area, the lows
hit in late February 2010, adding short yen positions could see
some more profit taking in the short run. 
 She saw near-term support for the Australian dollar at 86.40
yen, the 23.6 percent retracement of its recent rally from a low
of 75.05 on March 17 to a high of above 90 on Monday.
 The yen has fallen sharply in the wake of joint yen-selling
intervention by the Group of Seven nations in March, and on
expectations the Bank of Japan will lag other central banks in
raising interest rates.
 The dollar was last steady at 84.68 , having hit the
day's low around 84.55 yen soon after news of the fresh tremors.
 Positioning in the Australian dollar also looked stretched,
with CFTC data revealing currency speculators held record long
positions in the Aussie dollar in the week to April 5.
 The Australian dollar  was down 0.1 percent at
$1.0546, with one trader reporting selling by Asian corporate
names. It remained close to Friday's 29-year high of $1.0585.

(Adds details, background)	
 TOKYO, April 11 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa said the joint G7 currency intervention to stem sharp
yen rises in the wake of last month's devastating earthquake
played a critical role in stabilising financial markets.	
 Shirakawa also pledged to ensure that trust in Japan's
currency is maintained by conveying to markets that the central
bank will not directly underwrite government debt.	
 ""Despite the unprecedented major earthquake and subsequent
disasters and despite the fact that Japan's fiscal condition
remains severe, it was still possible to issue
(government)securities at low interest rates in a stable
manner,"" Shirakawa said in a speech at a seminar on Monday.	
 ""This was possible partly because the markets have
confidence that the aim of Japan's monetary policy is ... not to
facilitate government financing,"" he told the seminar, hosted by
the Institute of Regulation and Risk North Asia.	
 Shirakawa is expected to travel to Washington D.C. to attend
this week's gathering of G7 and G20 finance leaders, to be held
on the sidelines of the spring IMF meetings.	
 In their first joint intervention since 2000, the Group of
Seven rich nations sold the yen after it spiked to record
highs days after the quake, threatening to deal another blow to
Japan's export-reliant economy which was picking up from a lull
when the disaster struck.	
 Shirakawa said the concerted G7 action not only stabilised
exchange-rate moves but helped to prevent negative spillover
into the stock market and other markets.

 * Italy production up better than forecast 1.4 percent
 * France as expected at 0.4 percent
 * Germany reported way above forecasts last week
 
 ROME, April 11 (Reuters) - Strong industrial production data
from the euro zone's top three economies pointed to a healthy
rise in output in the region in February and strengthening
economic growth in the first quarter.
 Output in Italy rose a stronger than expected 1.4 percent,
data showed on Monday, after a steep drop the month before,
while France's 0.4 percent gain matched forecasts.
 ""It's pretty much in line with what we were expecting and
points to a strong first quarter, something we're seeing in
other countries like Germany for instance,"" said Marie Diron of
Oxford Economics after the French data.
 Last week Germany, the economic powerhouse of the 17 nation
euro zone, reported a 1.6 percent output rise for February, way
above expectations of 0.5 percent and following a 2.0 percent
gain in January.
 The data from the three countries that make up around two
thirds of the euro zone economy suggest Wednesday's aggregate
reading for the bloc could be stronger than expected.
 A Reuters survey of analyst conducted last week pointed to a
0.7 percent monthly rise, after a 0.3 percent increase in
January.
 Luigi Speranza of BNP Paribas said Italy, the euro zone's
third largest economy was still lagging most of its neighbours
despite the rebound in output in February.
 ""With a 0.5 percent monthly rise in March we will be looking
at a flat quarter in terms of industrial output, which is quite
disappointing considering the global context of expanding
activity,"" he said.
 He forecast euro zone economic growth would strengthen to
0.6 percent in the first quarter after the 0.3 percent rate at
the end of last year.
 Germany will lead the way with growth of 1.0 percent, and
Italy will grow by just 0.2 or 0.3 percent, he forecast.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Expectations of another rise in
European Central Bank interest rates by July kept the euro close
to recent highs on Monday and pushed euro zone government bond
prices lower.
 World stocks were weaker, although Wall Street looked set to
open higher as its latest corporate earnings loomed.
 Although the world economy is fairly robust, there are
growing expectations among investors that accompanying higher
commodity prices will drive up inflation and prompt central
banks to tighten monetary policy sooner.
 Oil prices dipped on Monday on hopes of a settlement in
Libya, but they remain high and technicals suggested Brent
could soon be heading towards $130 a barrel.
 The ECB raised its benchmark rate by 25 basis points last
week to 1.25 percent, the first hike since 2008, and used
language suggesting that another rise is in the pipeline.
 U.S. Federal Reserve officials, in the meantime, have been
making more hawkish comments, calling into question the future
of its asset-buying quantitative easing programme.
 ""This week, perhaps, the focus could be on whether the
Federal Reserve actually indicates to the market whether they
will be exiting their loose monetary policy, and whether they
display any hawkish signals,"" said Ong Yi Ling, investment
analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.
 One result of the mood was to send core euro zone debt
yields higher, with Bund yields above 3.5 percent from the first
time since August 2009.
 In the euro zone's debt crisis, a German magazine reported
on Saturday that some euro zone finance ministers had told the
ECB they have doubts Greece will meet its fiscal targets and
suggested it restructure its debt.
 The euro touched its highest against the yen since May 2010
of 123.33 yen on trading platform EBS. It later gave up some of
those gains and was last down at 122.52 yen.
 It was down nearly 0.2 percent to $1.4457, having hit a
15-month high of $1.4489 on Friday.
 
 HIGHER COMMODITIES
 On commodity markets, tin hit a record and lead scaled a
three-year high on the London Metal Exchange.
 Gold jumped to a lifetime high for a fifth session, topping
$1,476 an ounce.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were flat, with emerging
markets off 0.3 percent.
 European stocks fell as caution built before the next round
of corporate earnings reports. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares was down 0.2 percent.
 ""Investors seem too complacent at the moment, ahead of the
earnings season,"" said Frederic Buzare, global head of equity
management at Dexia Asset Management. ""I'm cautious on the short
term for stocks.""

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - The yen was off an 11-month low
against the euro and a 2-1/2 year trough versus the Australian
dollar on Monday, as bearish bets against the Japanese currency
appeared stretched and investors looked to take a breather.
 While some technical indicators suggested that rallies in
the euro and the Australian dollar against the yen could pause
in the short run, traders said the longer-term trend of yen
weakness was likely to remain intact as demand for yen carry
trades picks up.
 ""The Aussie/yen positions are clearly overbought and ripe
for a correction,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency strategist
at Credit Agricole. ""Should the U.S. dollar start to reverse
course, and that trend will become clear this week, we will see
some of those big carry trade positions being unwound.""
 For now, though, the U.S. dollar eased back in the direction
of last week's 16-month low against a basket of major currencies
, and also extended its recent losses against some Asian
currencies.
 A number of Asian central banks are said to have intervened
to prevent their currencies from rising, and traders said they
were likely to recycle those proceeds into the euro, lending
support to the common currency.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.4465, hovering around the
21-hour moving average at $ 1.4454, with bids said to be around
the $1.4410-25 area and lower. It had hit a 15-month high of
$1.4489 on Friday.
 The euro touched its highest against the yen since May 2010
of 123.33 yen on trading platform EBS. It later gave up some of
those gains and was last down 0.15 percent at 122.56.
 The yen has fallen sharply in the wake of joint yen-selling
intervention by the Group of Seven nations in March. The G7
stepped in after the yen hit a record high of 76.25 yen to the
dollar on March 17, propelled by speculation that Japanese
investors would repatriate their overseas assets after a massive
earthquake and tsunami struck Japan's northeast on March 11.
 Market expectations for the Bank of Japan to lag behind
other central banks in raising interest rates and a drop in
volatility after the G7 intervention have shifted the focus to
the appeal of carry trades, a tactic of selling low-yielding
currencies to fund investment in higher-yielding ones.
 
 OVERBOUGHT POSITIONS
 Technical indicators such as the 14-day relative strength
index and slow stochastics suggest that the euro and Australian
dollar are in overbought territory against the yen, pointing to
the possibility of a near-term pull-back.
 ""If you look at gauges such as stochastics ... they are
clearly in overbought territory,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior
manager for Okasan Securities' foreign securities department in
Tokyo, referring to the recent rally in the euro and other
currencies against the yen.
 Despite signs of a near-term correction, he added that
investors were reluctant to trim short yen positions as they
remained uncertain about its short-term prospects.
 ""People might sell the euro against the yen in the morning
but they will probably make sure to buy it back in the evening,""
he added.
 Positioning in the Australian dollar also looked stretched
judging from the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission's
(CFTC) latest data, which showed that currency speculators held
a record long position in the Aussie dollar in the week to April
5.
 The Australian dollar touched a high of 90.04 yen earlier on
Monday, its highest since September 2008. It later pared some of
its gains and was at 89.52 yen. The Aussie dollar rose 0.1
percent against the dollar to $1.0573, near Friday's 29-year
high of $1.0585.
 In a positive sign for global growth and risk trades,
Chinese data on Sunday showed exports and imports were both
stronger than expected in March, with little sign of any impact
from the Japanese quake.
 CFTC data also showed speculators go net short on the yen
for the first time in six weeks and by the biggest margin since
May 2010 at a net 43,231 contracts in the week to April 5.
 The dollar did manage to eke out gains against the yen,
however, inching up 0.1 percent to 84.80 yen. The dollar faces a
cluster of resistance at levels around 85.50 yen, including a
six-month high of 85.53 yen hit last week on EBS. Against a
basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.2 percent at 74.93,
near Friday's 16-month low of 74.838.

 ISTANBUL, April 11 (Reuters) - Turkey's current account
deficit surged 127 percent year-on-year to $6.127 billion in
February, less than forecast but illustrating the challenge
faced by the government to rein it in.
 In a Reuters poll of 13 analysts the median forecast was for
a $6.2 billion deficit.
 In the first two months of the year the deficit, a key weak
point in Turkey's otherwise positive economic outlook, widened
to $12.073 billion from $5.758 billion a year earlier, the
Central Bank data showed.
 ""The foreign trade deficit, which jumped 151.4 percent to
reach $5.937 billion in February, was the biggest factor in the
current account deficit rise,"" a statement from the bank said.
 Last year, the deficit widened 247 percent to a record high
of $48.557 billion, some 6.7 percent of GDP.
 In 2011 as a whole, the current account was expected to show
a deficit of $59.2 billion and many predict the deficit could
hit 7.5-8 percent of GDP this year.
 Fears about the deficit have been fuelled by rising oil
prices. Turkey imports around 95 percent of its crude and gas
needs.

 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, April 11 - The yen fell to an 11-month low
against the euro and a 2-1/2 year trough versus the Australian
dollar on Monday, and looked set to weaken further as investors
piled into carry trades in favour of higher-yielding assets.	
 The U.S. dollar dipped back in the direction of last week's
16-month low against a basket of major currencies, hurt by
positive signs for investor risk-taking, and also extended its
recent losses against some Asian currencies. 
 While some technical gauges suggested that rallies in the
euro and the Australian dollar against the yen could pause in
the near-term, traders said the broader trend of yen weakness
was likely to remain intact.	
 ""If you look at gauges such as stochastics...they are
clearly in overbought territory,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior
manager for Okasan Securities' foreign securities department in
Tokyo, referring to the recent rally in the euro and other
currencies against the yen.	
 ""But the yen could easily come back under pressure if there
is some type of catalyst, so I think market players are
reluctant to unload their entire position,"" Soma said.	
 ""People might sell the euro against the yen in the morning
but they will probably make sure to buy it back in the evening,""
he added.	
 The euro earlier touched its highest against the yen since
May 2010 of 123.33 yen on trading platform EBS, up about 16
percent from its mid-March low of 106.50 yen. 
 The euro later trimmed its gains and last stood at 122.62
yen , down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday.	
 The yen has fallen sharply in the wake of joint yen-selling
intervention by the Group of Seven industrialised nations in
March.	
 The G7 stepped in after the yen hit a record high of 76.25
yen to the dollar on March 17, propelled by speculation that
Japanese investors would repatriate their overseas assets after
a massive earthquake and tsunami struck Japan's northeast on
March 11.	
 Market expectations for the Bank of Japan to lag behind
other central banks in raising interest rates and a drop in
volatility after the G7 intervention have shifted the market's
focus to the appeal of carry trades, a tactic of selling
low-yielding currencies to fund investment in higher-yielding
currencies.	
 
 SIGNS OF OVERHEATING 
 Technical gauges such as the 14-day relative strength index
and slow stochastics suggest that the euro and Australian dollar
are in overbought territory against the yen, pointing to the
possibility of a near-term pull-back.	
 Positioning in the Australian dollar also looks stretched
judging from the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission's
latest data, which showed that currency speculators held a
record long position in the Aussie dollar in the week to April
5. [ID:nN08255295]	
 The Australian dollar touched a high of 90.04 yen earlier on
Monday, its highest since September 2008. It later pared some of
its gains and was last up 0.1 percent at 89.64 yen .	
 The Aussie dollar rose 0.1 percent against the dollar to
$1.0573 , near Friday's 29-year high of $1.0585.	
 In a positive sign for global growth and risk trades,
Chinese data on Sunday showed exports and imports were both
stronger than expected in March, with little sign of any impact
from the Japanese quake. [ID:nL3E7FA00N]	
 The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.4461 , but was still
not far from a 15-month high around $1.4490 struck on Friday.	
 ""Asian central banks have been extremely active, and with
oil prices moving higher once again, we expect further FX
reserve diversification to push EUR yet higher. The break of
1.4375 now opens up the way for a move to our target of 1.4500,""
BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note.	
 They said the preference for using the yen and dollar as
funding currencies will probably continue until oil prices hit a
tipping point, where the de facto tax on big oil-consuming
nations forces a downgrade of growth expectations.	
 Brent crude hit a 32-month high at $127.02 a barrel on
Monday  but then fell below $126 later in the session
the African Union said Muammar Gaddafi has accepted a roadmap to
end the civil war in Libya. 
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies
to 74.932 , near Friday's 16-month low of 74.838.	
 The dollar continued its downtrend against emerging market
currencies, hitting a fresh record low against the Singapore
dollar and a seven-year trough versus the Indonesian rupiah on
Monday. [ID:nL3E7FB043] [ID:nL3E7FB084]	
 The dollar did manage to eke out gains against the yen,
however, inching up 0.1 percent to 84.80 yen . The dollar
faces a cluster of resistance at levels around 85.50 yen,
including a six-month high of 85.53 yen hit last week on EBS.

 * Total value of offer 638 million CHF
 * Nibe wants to create European leader in sustainable energy

(Adds analyst comment, share price reaction)
 By Simon Johnson and Mattias Lovkvist
 STOCKHOLM, April 11 (Reuters) - Swedish heat pump maker Nibe
Industries on Monday launched a $700 million bid for
Switzerland's Schulthess Group to build a leading position in
the growing European market for sustainable heating.
 Nibe said it had bought 31 percent of Schulthess and was
offering 60 Swiss francs per share for the remainder of the
firm, which supplies heating, cooling and washing technology.
 The offer is made up of 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in
new Nibe B shares.
 Nibe, which among other things makes geothermal heating
pumps for houses, said the transaction corresponds to a total
equity value of 638 million Swiss francs ($699.4 million) and
had been recommended by Schulthess' board.
 The deal will give Nibe a wider product range in boilers,
heat pumps and solar panels, expand its market to include more
commercial and industrial customers and give it a broader
distribution network.
 Analysts said that Schulthess' leading position in heat
pumps in Germany, Switzerland and Austria was particularly
attractive.
 If the full buy-out goes ahead, Nibe said it expected
synergies of approximately 12 million Swiss francs in operating
earnings improvements on an annual basis with a full effect in
the financial year 2013.
 ""There is a lot of overlap in their product portfolios and
the markets they are in,"" said one analyst who declined to be
identified.
 However, shares in Nibe were down 3.5 percent at 103.75
crowns at 0955 GMT. 
 ""Clearly consensus is that they have paid a bit too much,""
said Peter Naslund, analyst at Swedbank. ""It doesn't look
exactly cheap.""
 Shares in Schulthess were up 10.9 percent at 58.55 Swiss
francs.
 Nibe, which has annual posted sales growth of 20 percent
since 1993, made an operating profit of 796 million crowns on
sales of 6.5 billion crowns in 2010. 
 It said Schulthess would be operated as a separate unit and
be part of Nibe's business area Nibe Energy Systems, its biggest
unit.
 Schulthess made an operating profit of 229 million crowns,
excluding restructuring costs, in 2010 on sales of 2.1 billion
crowns.

 * China posts first quarterly trade deficit since 2004
 * China March exports up 35.8 pct, imports up 27.3 pct
 * Economist sees Q1 deficit as a sign of rebalancing
(Add details, official view)	
 BEIJING, April 10 (Reuters) - China recorded a rare trade
deficit in the first quarter of the year on the back of domestic
economic strength and rising global commodity prices, the
customs administration said on Sunday.	
 From January to March, China imported $1.02 billion more
than it exported, marking its first quarterly trade deficit
since 2004, the General Administration of Customs said.	
 The trade numbers showed that China's economy was evolving
in a more sustainable direction by becoming less reliant on
exports, said Isaac Meng, economist with BNP Paribas in Beijing.
That is an essential ingredient in the rebalancing that analysts
say is needed to put the global economy on more stable footing.	
 ""Even though the exchange rate is only slowly appreciating,
strong inflation, especially labour costs, is making the
rebalancing happen,"" Meng said. 
 Zheng Yuesheng, statistics chief with the customs
administration, told state television that the first-quarter
deficit was likely to be ""temporary"", but added that the
full-year trade surplus would be smaller in 2011 than 2010.	
 In March alone, China reported a tiny trade surplus of $140
million, following a $7.3 billion deficit in February.	
 China's exports were up 35.8 percent in March from a year
earlier, while imports rose 27.3 percent from a year earlier.
Economists had expected exports to rise 21.0 percent year on
year and imports to increase 19.5 percent year on year,
producing a trade deficit of $4.2 billion. [ID:nL3E7F616W]	
 The first-quarter trade deficit is partly a seasonal issue
because Chinese exports tend to be slow early in the year. But
it also speaks to the progress that China is making towards
having a more balanced trade relationship with the rest of the
world.	
 Less about any specific policy, this is a reflection of
basic economic reality. China already is the world's biggest
exporter and so has little scope to increase its exports
further, while its demand for imports is increasing in leaps and
bounds alongside its ultra-fast growth.	
 
 REBALANCING	
 China has faced calls from the United States, the European
Union and others to let its yuan currency appreciate more
quickly as a way to cut its yawning trade surplus.	
 Beijing has opted for gradual nominal appreciation -- the
yuan has gained just 4.5 percent against the dollar since being
depegged last June -- but rising costs are translating into
faster real appreciation and denting demand for Chinese exports.	
 On the import side, officials have repeatedly vowed to buy
more foreign products to reduce the country's huge trade
surplus. For now, though, soaring global commodity costs were
the more immediate factor driving up China's import bill.	
 Prices of ""primary products"" -- raw materials and energy --
jumped 29.7 percent in the first quarter, significantly pushing
up the cost of Chinese imports.	
 For instance, import prices of iron ore, a key input for
Chinese steelmakers, jumped 59.5 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the customs administration said.	
 In another example, soybean import prices -- China is the
world's biggest buyer -- rose 25.7 percent in the first quarter,
though absolute import volume fell 0.7 percent year on year. 
 Wang Hu, an economist with Guotai Jun'an Securities in
Shanghai, said Chinese imports were always strong in the first
quarter as domestic firms make purchases for full-year
investment and production plans.	
 ""China's exports are likely to remain strong in coming
months with recovering demands in the United States and Europe,
and China will report a trade surplus in coming months,"" Wang
said.	
 
 JAPAN IMPACT 
 The biggest question mark hanging over China's trade
activity is the extent to which Japan's earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis will cause trouble.	
 ""People are still trying to assess the impact of Japan, so
it's not easy to say whether this pace can be maintained. It is
likely to slow down much more in the second quarter,"" said BNP's
Meng.	
 The Japanese disaster was already have an impact, Zheng, the
customs official, told state television.	
 ""As the world's third largest economy and the biggest source
of Chinese imports, Japan is set to affect part of China's
foreign trade,"" Zheng said.	
 Chinese imports from Japan rose 16.6 percent year on year in
March, 2.4 percentage points lower than the 19.0 percent pace
recorded in February.	
 China's imports of auto parts and machinery will bear the
brunt of disrupted production in Japan, Zheng added.	
 Wang from Guotai Jun'an said the disaster in Japan may help
Chinese exports in the long run despite short-term disruptions.	
 ""Japan accounted for about 8 percent of Chinese exports, and
the immediate impact will not be significant. From a longer-term
view, the reconstruction in Japan will mean huge demand for
Chinese products,"" Wang said.

 (Adds Misrata, detail on delegation)
 By Michael Georgy
 BENGHAZI, Libya, April 11 (Reuters) - Forces loyal to
Muammar Gaddafi shelled the besieged town of Misrata on Monday
after the African Union said he had accepted a plan to end
Libya's civil war. 
 Al Jazeera television quoted a rebel spokesman as saying
five people died and 20 were wounded in Misrata, a lone rebel
bastion in western Libya, which has been under siege for more
than six weeks.
 Rebels in Misrata told Reuters Gaddafi's forces fired
Russian-made Grad rockets into the city, where conditions for
civilians are said to be desperate.
 The insurgents said they would accept no plan that allowed
Gaddafi to stay in power and prepared to advance on the eastern
front after repelling a major government assault on Sunday
against their town of Ajdabiyah. 
 Prospects for a ceasefire looked remote.
 South African President Jacob Zuma, head of an AU peace
mission, said early on Monday that Gaddafi had accepted a peace
""road map"", including a ceasefire, after talks in Tripoli.
 A spokesman in the rebel capital of Benghazi said the
opposition would look at the plan but Gaddafi must end his
41-year rule.
 ""The Libyan people have made it very clear that Gaddafi must
step down, but we will consider the proposal once we have more
details, and respond,"" spokesman Mustafa Gheriani told Reuters.
 Libyan officials have repeatedly said that Gaddafi, who
holds no official state position, will not quit.
 The AU delegation went to Benghazi to confer with rebel
leaders on Monday and was met by more than 2,000 demonstrators
holding banners reading: ""African Union take Gaddafi with you""
and ""Gaddafi has committed genocide"".
 
 NO LET-UP IN NATO ATTACKS 
 Officials from NATO, which is bombing Libyan government
armour under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians, said
they took note of the AU proposal but the alliance would
continue operations while civilians were at risk. 
 ""It does not appear that this indication of a peace deal has
any substance at this point,"" said one NATO official in
reference to the shelling of Misrata.
The African Union does not have a good track record in
brokering peace deals, having failed recently to end conflict or
disputes in Somalia, Madagascar and Ivory Coast. 
 ""The issue of Gaddafi stepping down from any political
position is a closed issue ... Muammar Gaddafi does not hold a
position of power,"" Abdel Monem al-Lamoushi, a government
spokesman, told Al Arabiya television.
 ""No one has the right to send Muammar Gaddafi into exile out
of the land of his forefathers. This man will not leave Libya.""
 At the front outside the eastern rebel town of Ajdabiyah,
rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air
strikes and said they had been ordered to wait until noon to
advance because new NATO bombing was expected.
 Gheriani expressed surprise that Zuma did not travel to
Benghazi with the four other African heads of state. Zuma said
he had urgent business elsewhere.
 NATO, which has denounced attacks by Libya's forces on
civilian areas, said only that it took note of the AU proposal.
 The alliance stepped up attacks on Gaddafi's armour over the
weekend, destroying 25 tanks around Misrata and Ajdabiyah.

 NO DISCUSSION ON GADDAFI
 An African Union statement after the Tripoli talks made no
mention of Gaddafi's future. Asked if the issue of him stepping
aside was discussed, Ramtane Lamamra, AU Commissioner for Peace
and Security, told reporters: ""There was some discussion.""
 However he added: ""I cannot report on confidential
discussions because first of all I was not part of them.""
 The AU proposal included an immediate cessation of
hostilities, effective monitoring of the ceasefire, the delivery
of humanitarian aid and the protection of foreigners.
 Asked if he feared rebels might reject the plan, Lamamra
said: ""We believe what we have proposed is broad enough to
launch negotiations ... What we need is for them to accept that
we are people of good will.""
 The rebels have previously rejected a negotiated outcome to
what has become the bloodiest in a series of pro-democracy
revolts across the Arab world that have ousted the autocratic
leaders of Tunisia and Egypt.
 NATO said it had increased the tempo of its air operations
over the weekend, after rebels accused it of responding too
slowly to government attacks.
 The NATO attacks outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break
the biggest assault by Gaddafi's forces on the eastern front for
at least a week. The town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold
of Benghazi 150 km (90 miles) north up the Mediterranean coast.
 On Monday rebels were putting burned and mangled bodies into
blankets by blackened government vehicles outside Ajdabiyah and
dragging them into the desert for burial.
 ""We have been able to advance because of the air strikes,""
said rebel Belgassim El-Awami. It was not clear how far west the
rebels had moved along a front which has swung back and forth
for more than a week in a fight for the oil port of Brega.

 * Coalition would end policy-blocking parliament deadlock
 * Kan already deeply unpopular before quake, nuclear crisis
 
 TOKYO, April 11 (Reuters) - Japan's ruling party fared badly
in weekend local elections after Prime Minister Naoto Kan came
under fire for his handling of the nuclear crisis, bolstering
rivals who want him to quit once the crisis ends. 
 The unpopular Kan was already under pressure to step down
before a massive earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11,
leaving his government to cope with the worst crisis to hit
Japan since World War Two.
 Kan is unlikely to be forced out while experts struggle to
regain control of a crippled nuclear power plant north of Tokyo,
in the world's biggest nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.
 But if he then stood down, it would be easier for his
Democratic Party of Japan to form a ""grand coalition"" with the
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), an outcome many
voters favour as a way of dealing with the tens of thousands
left homeless, the reeling economy and the nuclear crisis.
 The DPJ lost nearly 70 seats in Sunday's election for
prefectural assemblies, Kyodo news agency said early on Monday.
The DPJ also lost to the LDP in three gubernatorial elections in
which it either fielded or supported a challenger.
 The DPJ's No.2 official, Katsuya Okada, told reporters that
a grand coalition with the LDP was a possibility, but that the
idea would need support from voters.
 ""What's most important is to think about what's best for the
people as we try to deal with the huge disaster,"" he said.
 The LDP's No.2, Nobuteru Ishihara, said the trust needed for
cooperation between two parties was lacking.
 ""The election results show that voters are asking, can we
allow the Kan government to handle the situation?"" he said.
 Observers had expected the Democratic Party to lose seats,
and had said a heavy loss was likely to be blamed on Kan.
 Even before the March 11 earthquake, Kan's own voter support
had slumped to around 20 percent and his grip on power weakened
because of policy changes and perceived clumsiness in diplomatic
rows with China and Russia.
 His ratings have risen to around 30 percent since March 11
but a majority of voters are unhappy with his handling of the
nuclear crisis, in which releases of radioactive material into
the air and sea have alarmed Japanese citizens and neighbouring
countries.
 Analysts say Kan is unlikely to be forced out during the
nuclear crisis, which could last months as engineers struggle to
restore the cooling systems of the crippled nuclear reactors at
the Fukushima Daiichi plant in the northeast.
 Kan's Democrats have a big majority in parliament's lower
house but need opposition help in the upper chamber. Before the
crisis, opposition parties in the upper house were blocking
budget bills to try to force a snap election.
 Kan's eventual resignation could clear the way for a
rejigged ruling coalition, and that would break a parliamentary
deadlock that has kept Japan from crafting policies to address
the country's most profound problems -- a fast-ageing society
and huge public debt.

 By Sudip Kar-Gupta
 LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - The future of Britain's
powerful banking industry is being scrutinised by one of Oxford
University's most prestigious professors.
 On Monday, Sir John Vickers will present the interim report
of the Independent Commission on Banking - a body set up by the
government to examine the reform of British banks after they got
badly burnt during the credit crisis.
 The bespectacled academic, who turns 53 this year, is
currently head of All Souls -- the imposing Oxford college which
only accepts those with top first-class degrees.
 The interim report, which is likely to back ""ring-fencing""
retail banks from risky trading operations to protect ordinary
savers, will precede a definitive report in September.
 British Finance Minister George Osborne will then examine
Vickers' proposals but the April interim report could be key.
 For much of the last year, Vickers has travelled back and
forth from Oxford to the ICB's small offices in London's
Victoria House, an art-deco edifice from the 1920s.
 The Vickers report may become as historic a date for British
banking as October 1986, when the ""Big Bang"" move to deregulate
the sector ushered in ""universal banks"" offering everything from
complex trading to mortgages and ordinary savings products.
 While the Vickers' commission is not expected to seek a full
break-up of these ""universal banks"", it is likely to ask
companies to set up separate subsidiaries for investment and
retail banking.
 Vickers grew up in the southern England seaside town of
Eastbourne. He attended Eastbourne Grammar School, where his
academic excellence took him to Oxford University's Oriel
College.
 At Oriel, Vickers got a first-class degree in PPE - a course
in politics, philosophy and economics pursued by countless
British businessmen and politicians, such as current prime
minister David Cameron.
 He briefly worked as a financial analyst for oil major Shell
for two years before returning to academia.
 Vickers held various teaching posts at Oxford, as well as
visiting positions at America's Harvard and Princeton
universities, before joining the Bank of England in 1998.
 At the Bank of England, Vickers was considered by analysts
to be one of the more ""hawkish"" members of the interest-rate
setting Monetary Policy Committee -- warning about inflation and
pushing for higher interest rates in 2000.
 FINING MANCHESTER UNITED
 Vickers left the Bank of England in 2000 for Britain's
Office of Fair Trading, a regulatory body dealing with
protecting consumers and tackling industry competition issues.
 At the OFT, Vickers presided over investigations into a
variety of sectors, included a 2003 probe into sportswear which
culminated in a 1.65 million pound ($2.70 million) fine for
Manchester United for fixing the prices of soccer kits.
 In 2005, Vickers also oversaw a price-fixing fine on British
retailer GUS and asked the UK's Competition Commission to probe
proposed bids for the London Stock Exchange.
 And in 2010, Vickers reformed the All Souls entrance exam,
dubbed by some as the ""hardest exam in the world"", deciding that
candidates would no longer have to write an essay based around
one single word.
 ""As with all these things, people have different opinions
and, like others, I feel regret when something that has been
going on for so many years ends. But I believe this is the right
decision,"" he said at the time.

the euro's stability than tax cuts, the designated new leader of
the ruling Free Democrats (FDP) said in an interview on Sunday
and hinted his party was shifting away from its tax cut mantra.
 Philipp Roesler, who will take the reigns of the junior
partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition
next month, said the FDP now wanted to focus on debt reduction
-- moving away from its previous demands for tax cuts.
 ""If the new tax estimate in May shows revenues are better
than expected, then I'd like to use any additional money for
budget consolidation,"" Roesler told the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
 A panel of independent experts will present the government
with a new tax take estimate for this year in May. The tax
estimate is then used by the government to shape its policies.
 ""We only have to look at Greece, Ireland and Portugal to see
how important it is to have stable budgets,"" Roesler said.
 Portugal bowed to pressure from financial markets and its
European partners this week and became the third euro zone
country after Greece and Ireland to request financial help from
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 Roesler, whose FDP has plunged in opinion polls to 3 percent
from the 14.6 percent it won in the 2009 election on a campaign
pledge to push for lower taxes, said the FDP was still
interested finding ways to reduce taxes.
 ""But the issue that's interesting people right now is the
stability of the euro,"" he said. ""How will lower taxes help them
if their money depreciates dramatically? That's especially true
in Germany, where a lot of people fear monetary instability.""
 The FDP, which sees itself as a guardian of German taxpayer
interests, has until now been the leading voice inside the
German government voicing opposition to euro zone rescue
measures. The FDP was nevertheless badly beaten in recent
regional elections.
 Health Minister Roesler, designated to replace Foreign
Minister Guido Westerwelle as FDP chairman and vice chancellor,
hinted that the FDP's position may be changing. Roesler will not
formally take charge until an FDP party congress in mid May.
 Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle also said in an interview
in Bild am Sonntag that tax cuts should be put on a back burner.
 ""Budget consolidation has priority,"" Bruederle said. ""If the
budget consolidation continues successfully, we'll have scope
for tax relief for the middle class.""

 * China March exports up 35.8 pct, imports up 27.3 pct
 * Economist sees Q1 deficit as a sign of rebalancing
(Add details, official view)	
 BEIJING, April 10 (Reuters) - China recorded a rare trade
deficit in the first quarter of the year on the back of domestic
economic strength and rising global commodity prices, the
customs administration said on Sunday.	
 From January to March, China imported $1.02 billion more
than it exported, marking its first quarterly trade deficit
since 2004, the General Administration of Customs said.	
 The trade numbers showed that China's economy was evolving
in a more sustainable direction by becoming less reliant on
exports, said Isaac Meng, economist with BNP Paribas in Beijing.
That is an essential ingredient in the rebalancing that analysts
say is needed to put the global economy on more stable footing.	
 ""Even though the exchange rate is only slowly appreciating,
strong inflation, especially labour costs, is making the
rebalancing happen,"" Meng said. 
 Zheng Yuesheng, statistics chief with the customs
administration, told state television that the first-quarter
deficit was likely to be ""temporary"", but added that the
full-year trade surplus would be smaller in 2011 than 2010.	
 In March alone, China reported a tiny trade surplus of $140
million, following a $7.3 billion deficit in February.	
 China's exports were up 35.8 percent in March from a year
earlier, while imports rose 27.3 percent from a year earlier.
Economists had expected exports to rise 21.0 percent year on
year and imports to increase 19.5 percent year on year,
producing a trade deficit of $4.2 billion. [ID:nL3E7F616W]	
 The first-quarter trade deficit is partly a seasonal issue
because Chinese exports tend to be slow early in the year. But
it also speaks to the progress that China is making towards
having a more balanced trade relationship with the rest of the
world.	
 Less about any specific policy, this is a reflection of
basic economic reality. China already is the world's biggest
exporter and so has little scope to increase its exports
further, while its demand for imports is increasing in leaps and
bounds alongside its ultra-fast growth.	
 
 REBALANCING	
 China has faced calls from the United States, the European
Union and others to let its yuan currency appreciate more
quickly as a way to cut its yawning trade surplus.	
 Beijing has opted for gradual nominal appreciation -- the
yuan has gained just 4.5 percent against the dollar since being
depegged last June -- but rising costs are translating into
faster real appreciation and denting demand for Chinese exports.	
 On the import side, officials have repeatedly vowed to buy
more foreign products to reduce the country's huge trade
surplus. For now, though, soaring global commodity costs were
the more immediate factor driving up China's import bill.	
 Prices of ""primary products"" -- raw materials and energy --
jumped 29.7 percent in the first quarter, significantly pushing
up the cost of Chinese imports.	
 For instance, import prices of iron ore, a key input for
Chinese steelmakers, jumped 59.5 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the customs administration said.	
 In another example, soybean import prices -- China is the
world's biggest buyer -- rose 25.7 percent in the first quarter,
though absolute import volume fell 0.7 percent year on year. 
 Wang Hu, an economist with Guotai Jun'an Securities in
Shanghai, said Chinese imports were always strong in the first
quarter as domestic firms make purchases for full-year
investment and production plans.	
 ""China's exports are likely to remain strong in coming
months with recovering demands in the United States and Europe,
and China will report a trade surplus in coming months,"" Wang
said.	
 
 JAPAN IMPACT 
 The biggest question mark hanging over China's trade
activity is the extent to which Japan's earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis will cause trouble.	
 ""People are still trying to assess the impact of Japan, so
it's not easy to say whether this pace can be maintained. It is
likely to slow down much more in the second quarter,"" said BNP's
Meng.	
 The Japanese disaster was already have an impact, Zheng, the
customs official, told state television.	
 ""As the world's third largest economy and the biggest source
of Chinese imports, Japan is set to affect part of China's
foreign trade,"" Zheng said.	
 Chinese imports from Japan rose 16.6 percent year on year in
March, 2.4 percentage points lower than the 19.0 percent pace
recorded in February.	
 China's imports of auto parts and machinery will bear the
brunt of disrupted production in Japan, Zheng added.	
 Wang from Guotai Jun'an said the disaster in Japan may help
Chinese exports in the long run despite short-term disruptions.	
 ""Japan accounted for about 8 percent of Chinese exports, and
the immediate impact will not be significant. From a longer-term
view, the reconstruction in Japan will mean huge demand for
Chinese products,"" Wang said.

 * PM says economic and political chaos must be avoided
 * Dispute now likely to end up in lengthy court process
 * Government to review economic outlook, IMF talks delayed
 
 By Anna Ringstrom and Karolina Tagaris
 REYKJAVIK/LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Britain and the
Netherlands plan to sue Iceland in a potentially drawn-out legal
battle to recover $5 billion lost in a bank crash after
Icelandic voters rejected a plan to repay the money.
 The British and Dutch governments said they were
disappointed with the result of a referendum on Saturday in
which almost 60 percent of voters opposed a repayment deal, the
second time the Icelandic public has snubbed an agreement.
 The debt was incurred when the two countries compensated
their nationals who lost savings in online ""Icesave"" accounts
owned by Landsbanki, one of three Icelandic banks that collapsed
in late 2008, triggering economic meltdown in the country of
320,000 people.
 Britain's Independent newspaper said the 'no' vote would
cause friction with Britain and the Netherlands and increased
the chances that one or the other, both European Union members,
might veto Iceland's bid to join the bloc.
 Britain's Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander,
said he was disappointed Icelanders seemed to have rejected what
was a negotiated settlement.
 ""It now looks like this process will end up in the courts,""
he told BBC television"" over the weekend.
 Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said: ""This is not
good for Iceland, nor for the Netherlands. The time for
negotiations is over. Iceland remains obliged to repay. The
issue is now for the courts to decide.""
 The issue will now be settled by the court of the EFTA
Surveillance Authority (ESA), the European trade body overseeing
Iceland's cooperation with the European Union.
 ""My estimate is that the process will take a year, a year
and a half at least, Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson told
a news conference after Saturday's vote.
 Economists have said the court route could be much costlier
and Iceland will face delays ending currency controls, boosting
investment and returning to financial markets for funding.
 
 GOVERNMENT'S FUTURE
 The Financial Times said the case highlighted flaws in
European cross-border banking rules and raised questions over
who is legal and morally responsible for foreign deposits held
by domestic banks when a country's financial sector goes bust.
 ""It has also raised doubts over the future of Iceland's
centre-left government, led by Johanna Sigurdardottir, prime
minister, who has staked her credibility on resolving the
Icesave dispute and pushing for EU membership.""
 Iceland's centre-left coalition government said it would not
resign despite the defeat.
 ""The government will emphasize maintaining economic and
financial stability in Iceland and continuing along the path of
reconstruction which it began following the economic collapse of
2008,"" it said in a statement.
 It said a fresh round of talks on further funding from the
International Monetary Fund, which led a bailout for the island,
would be delayed several weeks, but that it had enough foreign
exchange reserves to cover debts maturing this year and next.
 Ratings agencies were following the vote closely. Moody's
had said it might lower Iceland's rating in case of a 'no'.
 Standard & Poor's analyst Eileen Zhang said a 'no' vote
""might possibly result in a lengthy legal process and further
uncertainties regarding the ultimate fiscal cost"".
 The government still hopes most of the debt will eventually
be paid back from the estate of the bankrupt Landsbanki.
 Former British foreign minister Alistair Darling, who
approved the use of 3 billion pounds ($4.92 billion) of
taxpayers' money to bail out Icesave, defended his decision,
saying it was made ""simply to protect British savers"".
 ""I always thought this would take a long time to resolve,
but the present (British) government is right to pursue it in
the way it is doing,"" he said.

 * Current scenario based on 7.3 magnitude quake
 * Major companies unlikely to move out of capital

 By Linda Sieg	
 April 10 (Reuters) - More than 10,000 people dead, hundreds
of thousands injured, nearly one million buildings destroyed,
millions forced to evacuate and a fifth of Japan's economy wiped
out.	
 That's the scenario forecast if a huge magnitude 7.3
earthquake hits Japan's capital of Tokyo, a disaster experts say
has a 70 percent risk of occurring over the next 30 years.	
 Tokyo planners have been working for decades to mitigate the
damage from a quake of that scale and the country has some of
the world's strictest quake-resistance building standards.	
 But a month after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake -- the biggest
in Japan's recorded history -- and huge tsunami devastated
northeast Japan, some say it's time to prepare for far worse.	
 Tokyo had a tiny taste of what would happen when the March
11 quake, its epicentre about 300 km (180 miles) northeast,
halted trains, stranded commuters, snarled phone communication,
caused power shortages and within hours saw stores stripped of
daily necessities such as bread and milk.	
 ""Many people said what happened was beyond expectations, but
I believe it's the responsibility of government to prepare for
the unexpected,"" said Hideo Higashikokubaru, who is running as
an independent in Sunday's election for Tokyo governor.	
 Experts agree Tokyo needs to rethink its plans, including
what to do if disaster strikes nuclear power plants located even
closer to the capital than the crippled Fukushima plant 240 km
(150 miles) away, where engineers are trying to contain the
world's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years. (ID:nLDE7380D5)	
 ""If a bigger earthquake strikes Tokyo, we might face a
catastrophe,"" said Takaaki Kato, a professor at the University
of Tokyo's International Center for Urban Safety Engineering and
a member of a government advisory panel on disaster plans. 
 ""Preparation still isn't enough for a magnitude 7.3 quake.
Although there would be damage and people would suffer, it would
be possible to recover,"" he said.	
 ""But we need to revise policies so even if there is a quake
of about magnitude 8.0, we can limit the damage and confusion.""	
 The last major earthquake to strike Tokyo was the 1923
magnitude 7.9 tremor that killed more than 140,000 people and
devastated much of the capital and nearby Yokohama.	
 A magnitude 7.3 earthquake would be bad enough, since Tokyo
and nearby urban areas are now home to 35 million of Japan's 128
million people and about one-third of its economy.	
 A government report has forecast that a quake of that scale
directly under Tokyo would kill up to 11,000 people, injure
about 210,000, force 7 million to evacuate and cost the $5
trillion economy around $1 trillion in damages -- three times
the estimate for damage from the March 11 disaster.	
 WANTING TO FLEE	
 Reconstruction costs would be a huge burden on a nation
already staggering under public debt equal to about twice GDP.	
 ""Japan has enough savings surplus to fund reconstruction of
(the quake-hit northeast) ... but if you had to multiply the
costs for Tokyo, Japan would become dependent on foreign funds,""
said Jesper Koll, director of equities research at JP Morgan in
Tokyo.	
 One question is how Tokyo would cope with a nuclear crisis
closer to the capital, such as at Chubu Electric Power's
Hamaoka plant 200 km to the southwest.	
 ""There is no plan for a case in which the entire area
becomes contaminated with radiation,"" Kato said. ""People would
want to flee, but they couldn't all at once. If that happens, we
may have to evacuate children as was done during the war.""	
 The spectre of disaster in the capital has prompted an
advisor to Prime Minister Naoto Kan to propose creating a shadow
government in another part of Japan.	
 ""We need to think about either dispersing government
functions or creating a backup system in western Japan,"" Hosei
University professor Takayoshi Igarashi told Reuters.	
 Others say that is impractical given the huge cost. And
while Tokyo-based companies are reviewing business continuity
plans (BCP) in light of the recent disaster, a major dispersal
of economic activity would be difficult.	
 ""You have to understand the dynamics of what makes cities
like Tokyo grow and why companies take the risk. It's because
... the decision-making process is there,"" said Fouad
Bendimerad, head of the Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative, a
scientific group that promotes better disaster preparedness.	
 ""At the end of the day, taking risk will just be part of
doing business,"" he said. ""There is no place in Japan that is
safe from earthquakes.""

 * Pumping of radioactive water into sea to end Sunday
 * Beijing to closely monitor Japan's nuclear actions
 * PM to feel voter anger over nuclear crisis
(Updates with comment from NISA)	
 By Shinichi Saoshiro and Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, April 10 (Reuters) - Japan hopes to stop pumping
radioactive water into the sea on Sunday, which should help ease
concerns in neighbouring China and South Korea over the spread
of radiation from the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.	
 But problems in restoring cooling systems at Japan's
crippled nuclear plant, hit by a tsunami on March 11, mean more
contaminated water may eventually be pumped into the sea if the
complex again runs out of storage capacity.	
 Japan is struggling to regain control of the Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear plant after a massive earthquake and tsunami
devastated its northeast on March 11, and is facing a major
humanitarian and economic crisis.	
 ""We cannot say what the outlook is for the next stage,""
Hidehiko Nishiyama, a deputy director-general of the Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) said on Sunday. ""As soon as
possible we would like to achieve stable cooling and set a
course towards controlling radiation.""	
 China and South Korea have criticised Japan's handling of
the nuclear crisis, with Seoul calling it incompetent,
reflecting growing international unease over the month-long
atomic disaster and the spread of radiation.	
 Japanese voting in local elections on Sunday are expected to
vent their anger over Prime Minister Naoto Kan's handling of the
nuclear crisis, further weakening him and bolstering opponents
who will try force his resignation once the crisis ends. Results
of the vote are expected on Monday.	
 The unpopular Kan was already under pressure to step down
before the worst disaster to hit Japan since World War Two, but
analysts say he is unlikely to be dumped during the nuclear
crisis, which is set to drag on for months.	
 
 
 ANTI-NUCLEAR PROTESTS	
 In Tokyo, around 5,000 people took to the streets
in two separate anti-nuclear protests on Sunday. Some carried
placards reading 'No More Fukushima' and 'No Nukes'; others
danced and played musical instruments. One group of
demonstrators marched to the offices of the operator of the
striken plant, Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) .	
 TEPCO apologised on Saturday for the crisis.	
 ""I would like to apologise from my heart over the worries
and troubles we are causing for society due to the release of
radiological materials into the atmosphere and seawater,"" Sakae
Muto, a TEPCO vice president, told a news conference.	
 Radiation from Japan spread around the entire northern
hemisphere in the first two weeks of the nuclear crisis,
according to the Vienna-based Preparatory Commission for the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation.	
 Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is reeling from
the triple disaster and several countries have banned or
restricted food imports after detecting radiation.	
 More critically, the nuclear crisis and power shortages have
disrupted Japan's manufacturing and electronics global supply
chains, hitting computer and automakers in particular.	
 Power blackouts and restrictions, factory shutdowns, and a
sharp drop in tourists have hit the world's most indebted
nation, which is facing a damages bill as high as $300 billion
-- the world's biggest for any natural disaster.	
 The government had called for restraint from Japanese to
help the recovery effort, but families and friends were out in
force at cherry blossom viewing parties, traditional events that
herald spring, although some were toning down the usual
alcohol-induced revelry in deference to the disaster victims.	
 ""It's quieter than usual. There are lots of people but
they're a bit subdued,"" said one middle-aged woman, strolling
beneath the delicate pink blossoms. ""The blossoms are in full
bloom for us and we should appreciate them,"" she said. 
 
 RADIOACTIVE WATER	
 An unmanned drone helicopter is scheduled to fly over four
reactors to video damage and gauge radiation in areas where
workers are unable to safely enter. Remote-controlled trucks
will be used to remove some of the radioactive rubble.	
 Efforts to regain control of six reactors hit by the
15-metre high tsunami, which caused partial meltdowns to some
reactor cores after fuel rods were overheated, has been hindered
by 60,000 tonnes of radioactive water.	
 Japan's Nuclear Industry and Safety Authority said efforts
to restore cooling systems were not making clear progress.	
 TEPCO wants to start moving some of the highly
contaminated water out of the way, a key step towards restoring
the critical cooling system.	
 ""We may be able to use (electric) systems that are currently
functioning for cooling, and that may speed up the cooling
restoration. But there is no concrete and clear option,"" said
NISA's Nishiyama.	
 ""It is one step forward, one step backwards.""

figures, including veteran politicians and business leaders,
urged rival parties on Saturday to agree an urgent action plan
to lead the country out of political and economic crisis.
 The appeal came as euro zone ministers, meeting in Hungary,
said the debt-laden country must make deeper budget cuts and
commit to reforms in return for an 80 billion euro bailout the
bloc wants to finalise by mid-May.
 In an open letter, 47 prominent personalities called for the

parties to reach a compromise ""to guarantee the capacity to
execute an immediate action plan that would allow external
credibility to be secured.""
 The minority Socialist government of Prime Minister Jose
Socrates resigned last month after parliament rejected its
latest austerity plan, designed to avoid a bailout. The country
now faces a snap election on June 5.
 ""Difficulties in dialogue between political leaders and
rising tensions in public debates on the eve of an election
campaign threaten to dangerously undermine the defining of
consistent solutions for national problems,"" the group,
including three ex-presidents, wrote.
 Steeply rising borrowing costs and credit ratings downgrades
forced the caretaker government to seek an international rescue
package on Wednesday. The main opposition party has backed the
request for aid, but negotiations on an economic adjustment
programme -- a precondition for assistance -- are likely to be
tough, as cross-party consensus will be needed.
 The open letter, published in the Expresso weekly, urged the
main parties to guarantee that the next government would have
parliament's unequivocal backing for a credible budget
consolidation plan.
 ""Affirming these commitments via a joint effort by the
political leaders would certainly help build a stable governmnet
solution, giving Portuguese a first premise to justify their
sacrifices and look into the future with hope,"" the letter said.
 Socrates will run for the premiership again in the June
election. The main opposition Social Democrats lead in opinion
polls, but are far from winning an absolute majority.
The letter was signed by former prime minister and president

 By Anna Ringstrom and Omar Valdimarsson
 REYKJAVIK, April 10 (Reuters) - Voters in Iceland appeared
on Sunday to have rejected for a second time a plan to repay
debts to Britain and the Netherlands from a bank crash, a move
the prime minister said risked economic and political chaos.
 ""The worst option was chosen. The vote has split the nation
in two,"" Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir told state
television as partial results were issued which she said made it
fairly clear the ""no"" side had won.
 With around 85,000 votes in the referendum counted, official
figures showed 58 percent had voted against the accord compared
with 42 percent in favour, the television said. Iceland has
230,000 voters but the turnout was not immediately available.
 The prime minister, who had predicted a no vote would cause
economic uncertainty for at least a year or two, did not say
whether the government planned to resign.
 ""We must do all we can to prevent political and economic
chaos as a result of this outcome,"" she said.
 The debt was incurred when Britain and the Netherlands
compensated their nationals who lost savings in online ""Icesave""
accounts owned by Landsbanki, one of three Icelandic banks that
collapsed in late 2008.
 Icelandic lawmakers in February backed the repayment plan
agreed with creditors in December but the president refused to
sign the bill, triggering the vote. In March 2010, Iceland
rejected an earlier Icesave repayment blueprint in a referendum.
 The dispute over repayment has soured relations between the
small North Atlantic island nation and the two other countries.
 It may now be solved in a European court rather than in
bilateral negotiations -- a solution that may take several years
and that some economists say would be much costlier.
 ""It is clear that we have reached the end of the negotiation
road,"" Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson told state
television.
 Sigurdardottir said Iceland would now defend its case before
the court of the European trade body overseeing Iceland's
cooperation with the EU, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA).
 Economic Affairs Minister Arni Arnasson told the television
he would be in touch next week with ESA, which said last year,
in a first stage in legal proceedings that may end up in court,
that Iceland should pay compensation to Icesave depositors.
 Policymakers and economists have said solving the Icesave
issue would help Iceland, whose economy went into deep recession
after its bank crisis, get back into financial markets to fund
itself. That is a condition for it to remove controls on capital
flows it imposed in 2008 to stabilise a tumbling currency.
 The controls have left an estimated 465 billion crowns
($4.10 billion), equivalent to a quarter of Iceland's gross
domestic product, in the hands of foreign investors, many of
whom are expected to want to pull out when controls are lifted.
 Iceland last month outlined a cautious plan to gradually
relax the capital controls, a process expected to take years.
The main steps will take place only once Iceland has shown it
can refinance loans in foreign credit markets.

 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, April 8 (Reuters) - Brazil's and
Mexico's currencies traded at more than two-year highs on
Friday, and expectations that Brazilian authorities are losing
the will to fight global investment flows bode for further
gains for the real.
 The region's currencies were supported by a broadly weaker
dollar as the prospect of a U.S. government shutdown due to a
budget deadlock undermined support for the greenback. For more,
see: [ID:nN08295134]
 Brazil's real surged 2.4 percent this week as the market
brushed off the government's latest efforts to tax investors
who are gaming low interest rate loans in developed economies
against the payoff of Brazil's double-digit yields.
 Brazil's finance minister has tried to stop the real's
relentless surge with a series of measures, including taxes on
foreign loans and other capital controls, but his threat of
further action seems to have lost its sting. [ID:nN08190712]
 ""We can expect another round of currency appreciation,
since the exchange market is becoming convinced that
authorities do not seem willing to act firmly,"" Sydney Nehme,
executive director of NGO brokerage wrote in a note.
 The real  bid 0.63 percent firmer at 1.572 per
dollar, closing at its strongest since August 2008.
 The currency was less than 0.8 percent from trading at its
strongest in more than 12 years, when Brazil introduced a
floating exchange rate.
 Analysts are divided whether Brazilian authorities are
willing to allow further appreciation to help contain
inflation, or if they have just run out of good options to
contain the real's gains.
 Some analysts are betting the currency could firm to as
strong as 1.50 per dollar, while others expect gains to be
limited to 1.55 per dollar amid the threat of further
government efforts.
 Investors will continue to be drawn to Latin America's
currencies and high-yielding debt as long as the United States
is seen lagging the European Union's move to start hiking
interest rates, analysts said.
 Weakness in the yen has also fueled fresh bets on Latin
American currencies, funded with the Japanese currency.
 Mexico's peso  firmed 0.3 percent to 11.7320 per
dollar, pulling back after staking out a fresh intraday high of
11.7124 per dollar.
 Traders pointed to support for the dollar at the 11.70
level, where option barriers are likely layered, and resistance
around 11.78 per dollar.
 The Mexican currency was on track to notch a gain near 0.9
percent this week as the peso enjoyed support from expectations
a recovering U.S. economy will boost demand for the country's
exports.
 Chile's peso  bid up 0.47 percent to 469.70 per
dollar.
 The currency gained more than 1.2 percent this week, backed
by a rebound in prices for copper, the country's main export,
and bets the country's central bank could deliver another
aggressive interest rate hike next week.
 Data on Friday showed Chilean consumer prices rose in March
at the fastest pace in 18 months, backing expectations that the
central bank could raise its key interest rate next week by 50
basis points, to 4.50 percent. [ID:nN08178268]
 Peru's sol  bid up 0.14 percent to 2.7970 per U.S.
dollar after the country's central bank on Thursday raised its
benchmark interest rate to 4 percent from 3.75 percent, the
fourth straight hike to control inflation.
 The sol recorded a slight weekly gain, its first after
slumping during the previous two weeks after left-wing
nationalist presidential candidate Ollanta Humala gained
momentum in late March polls.
 This week's polls showed Humala may win the first round on
Sunday but struggle in a June 5 run-off. [ID:nN07122940]

 NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - Oil surged to a 32-month high
on Friday above $126 a barrel on concerns about long-term
supply cuts, while expectations of more interest rate hikes in
Europe drove the euro to a 15-month peak against the U.S.
dollar.
 Gold rose to a record high for a fourth straight day as
commodities gained broadly on expectations of stronger demand
from the worldwide economic recovery and a weaker dollar.
 European shares saw a five-week closing high, lifted by
rising commodity stocks such as miners, and on optimism over
the start of the first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season
next week. But Wall Street stocks ended lower on concerns about
the impact of higher energy costs on the economy.
 The MSCI main world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.5
percent to its highest since July 2008, and on track for its
third consecutive weekly gain.
 Interest rate hikes by China and the European Central Bank
this week failed to contain the bullish outlook as investors
eyeing heightened inflationary threats flocked to hard assets
such as oil, gold and other precious metals as hedges.
 ""It's an across-the-board surge in all the commodities.
Gold, oil ... they're all up. People are dumping the dollar and
buying commodities,"" said MF Global senior commodity analyst
Edward Meir.
 Brent crude  surged $3.98 to settle at $126.65 a
barrel, its highest level since August 2008, as the war in
Libya, unrest elsewhere in the Arab world and postponed
elections in Nigeria drove bullish sentiment on oil.
 U.S. crude  settled up $2.49 to a 30-month high of
$112.79.

 TORONTO, April 8 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar hit its
highest level in more than three years against a broadly weaker
U.S. dollar on Friday, marking its third weekly gain, as
commodity prices rallied and jobs data provided some upbeat
economic news.
 Though Canada surprisingly lost 1,500 jobs in March, a huge
jump in full-time positions suggested solid economic growth and
bolstered expectations the central bank will raise interest
rates later this year, likely in July. [ID:nN08186389]

 The currency cut some of its gains however heading into the

investor worries about inflation and the economic recovery.

 The Canadian dollar ended the North American session at
C$0.9574 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0445, up from Thursday's
close of C$0.9585 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0433.
 It rose for the ninth time in the past ten sessions and was
up 0.7 percent for the week -- its third weekly gain.
 ""Obviously, the upward trend in CAD is still quite strong.
And it's not just Canada, we've seen a whole host of currencies
reach new highs today and that just speaks to the broad U.S.
dollar move as opposed to being a CAD specific move,"" said
Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 ""Markets have caught wind that globally central banks are
hiking rates and the (U.S. Federal Reserve) is not.
 The European Central Bank raised rates by 25 basis points
on Thursday, its first increase since the 2008 financial
crisis, and signaled it is ready to tighten further if needed.
 ""Interest rate spreads are expected to move further and if
the ECB feels the euro zone is strong enough to handle higher
rates then that's likely true in a lot of countries,"" added
Sutton.
 Higher rates are also expected in Canada later this year
despite the weak headline number on the jobs report.
 The Bank of Canada is expected to make its first interest
rate hike of 2011 in July, as it balances rising economic
growth against tame inflation and a high-flying Canadian
dollar, according to a Reuters poll on Thursday.
 ""I would think at some point you should think more
seriously about May,"" said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income
and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The real obstacle is not so much the data, but the Bank of
Canada's attitude about it and we find out about their attitude
next week,"" he added, noting the Monetary Policy Report on
Wednesday.
 Following the jobs data, the currency  touched a
high of C$0.9526 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.05, its strongest
since late 2007. The next resistance levels from there are big
round numbers leading to the modern-day high of $1.10, said
Sutton.
 ""Ninety-five, ninety-four, ninety-three ... That move was
so fast and we just went down and right back up so there's not
a ton of support (for the U.S. dollar) between here and
there.""
 BONDS LOWER, LITTLE MOVED BY DATA
 Canadian government bond prices were lower across the
curve, tracking a similar move by U.S. Treasuries, although
they outperformed slightly.
 The employment numbers, the last data available to the Bank
of Canada ahead of its April 12 rate announcement, caused
minimal response, noted Chandler.
 The two-year bond  was off 3 Canadian cents to
yield 1.901 percent, while the 10-year bond  was
down 10 Canadian cents to yield 3.449 percent.

 NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - Expectations interest-rate
differentials will widen further in Europe's favor should buoy
the euro against the dollar next week, while investors will
closely watch U.S. inflation data that could help shape Federal
Reserve monetary policy.
 The euro rose to a 15-month peak versus the dollar on
Friday, on pace for a gain of 1.7 percent this week. The
prospect of a U.S. government shutdown, which would idle about
800,000 federal government workers and put a crimp in the
economic recovery, weighed on the dollar.
 The European Central Bank raised rates by 25 basis points
on Thursday, its first hike since the 2008 financial crisis,
and signaled it's ready to tighten further if needed.
Expectations of higher rates boosted the euro even as Portugal
became the third euro zone country to request a bailout.
 ""The market is ignoring all of Europe's fiscal and banking
troubles and trading off a single indicator -- interest
differentials,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC
World Markets in Toronto.
 The euro was last up 1.1 percent at $1.4459, climbing to a
session high of $1.4465 on Reuters data after taking out
reported option barriers at $1.4450. The level also marks the
61.8 percent retracement of the move from the euro's record
high above $1.6000 hit in 2008 to the 2010 low of $1.1876.
 Traders cited further upside targets of $1.4500 and the
January 2010 high around $1.4580.
 ""At this point, the euro has been on a one-way ticket north
and pretty easily could break $1.45 next week,"" said John
Doyle, strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.

 U.S. INFLATION
 The dollar was pressured as the White House and Congress
worked frantically to break a U.S. budget deadlock by the end
of the day in order to avoid a government shutdown.
 A shutdown would be far-reaching, since among other actions
it would stop payment of government suppliers and possibly
close private enterprises reliant on government operations.
 The lost wages and spending would ripple through to other
areas of the economy at a time of uncertain economic growth,
though some analysts noted that any impact would be short-lived
and government spending for the year would be the same.
 Investors will watch March U.S. retail sales data next week
to gauge the strength of consumer spending. A round of
inflation readings, including consumer and producer prices,
will also be scrutinized and a pick-up in inflationary
pressures could see investors bring forward expectations of
U.S. rate hikes, which would lift the dollar.
 Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 84.76,
still within striking distance of a six-month high hit this
week. Market players said the yen could weaken further on
expectations the Bank of Japan will keep monetary policy
stimulative for much longer following the country's massive
earthquake and nuclear crisis.
 Speculators cut bets in favor of the yen this week, going
short the Japanese currency by the biggest margin in nearly a
year, data showed on Friday, and built up a record long
position in the Australian dollar.
 The data, released by the Commodity and Futures Trading
Commission, also showed net short U.S. dollar position fell
slightly to $25.18 billion in the week to April 5.
 The Australian dollar rose to $1.0552, its highest level
versus the greenback since it was floated in December 1983. The
aussie has benefited from strong domestic economic growth,
staving off the malaise of the rest of the developed world in
recent years, fueled in large part by exports of raw materials
to China.

 By Luciana Lopez
 SAO PAULO, April 8 (Reuters) - Brazilian Finance Minister
Guido Mantega's off-the-cuff approach to currency strategy is
costing him credibility and encouraging markets to brush aside
his attempts to hold back the real.
 Mantega hit the headlines for declaring a ""currency war""
last year, but now he seems to be signaling a retreat.
 The minister has tried to stop the real's relentless surge
with a series of measures, including taxes on foreign loans and
other capital controls, announced in a piecemeal fashion and
sometimes as often as one a week.
 In between, Mantega and his team have threatened further
action in an apparent campaign to keep markets on their toes.
 Now, that strategy looks like a failure.
 The real  has hit a two-year high against the dollar,
boosted by Brazil's strong growth and the low returns available
in rich countries.
 It jumped almost 2 percent on Thursday alone, just hours
after the announcement of the latest currency measure -- an
extension of taxes on foreign loans.
 With inflation close to breaching the government's target,
traders see less to fear from policymakers who are shifting
their focus to high inflation rates rather than the currency.
 Given that change, analysts say the real will likely keep
on strengthening, especially as a strong currency will help
curb inflation by making imports cheaper.
 Mantega himself was quoted as saying on Friday that a
strong currency would slow inflation.
 Barclays this week revised its forecast for the real to as
low as 1.5 to the dollar, a level not seen in 12 years.
 The bit-by-bit strategy to brake the real ""just reinforces
the view ... that the FX strategy thus far has been a failed
one,"" said RBS Securities analyst Flavia Cattan-Naslausky.
""They've reached the limit of what they can do about it.""

 Brazil's economic growth: http://r.reuters.com/tux38r
 Graphic on interest rates: http://r.reuters.com/rur78r
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ""The market is testing the monetary authorities,"" said
Miriam Tavares, currency director at brokerage AGK Corretora in
Sao Paulo. ""I think it's inexorable,"" she said of a further
strengthening of the real.
 DAZED AND CONFUSED
 Brazil's economy is set to grow around 4 percent this year,
less than the 7.5 percent surge of last year but still better
than much of the developed world.
 The investment-grade nation has some of the world's highest
interest rates, with its benchmark rate at 11.75 percent. That
is in stark contrast to the euro zone's 1.25 percent, even
after a rate hike by the European Central Bank on Thursday.
 There is still easy money to be made in Brazil, but the
wave of speculative cash is hurting industry by encouraging
cheap imports and making exports more expensive.
 Rumors have circulated in markets that Mantega might be
close to the end of his five-year tenure in the job. However,
President Dilma Rousseff has given no sign she wants Mantega
out.
 The finance ministry declined to comment on Thursday and a
report in newspaper Valor Economico on Friday called Mantega
one of Rousseff's closest ministers.
 High inflation rates have backed Brazil's policymakers into
a corner. Annual inflation has hit 6.3 percent, within a
whisker of the top of the government's target range.
 Mantega, speaking to reporters in Brasilia on Thursday,
insisted inflation would slow soon.
 That same inflation keeps the central bank from cutting
interest rates, which would discourage yield-chasing global
investors from pouring speculative money into Brazil.
 Similarly, clamping down further on inflows could hamper
long-term investment, which the country desperately needs to
beef up flagging infrastructure.
 Other government ministers are resisting the use of more
foreign exchange measures, a government source told Reuters, as
inflation worries take center stage.
 All told, Brasilia has few cards to play, and some
government sources have admitted as much. [ID:nN01172691]
 Another government source told Reuters earlier this year
that Mantega was willing to create false expectations in the
market, if it helps keep the real from appreciating.
 ""It is a credibility hit so far,"" said Win Thin, global
head of emerging markets currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman. ""They're definitely testing the market's patience.""

 * Putin tells govt not to implement WTO rules for now
 * Russia concerned about cheap Chinese imports

(Adds Russian source on rules)
 By Darya Korsunskaya and Gleb Bryanski
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, April 8 (Reuters) - Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said on Friday Russia would not abide by any
World Trade Organisation rules until it became a member and was
free to slap duties on cheap machinery imports from China.
 Russia is growing increasingly frustrated with its 18-year
bid to join the global trade watchdog, and the rules it has
already implemented during the accession process have been
criticised by domestic manufacturers. 
 ""Why the hell should they take us in if we are implementing
all the rules anyway?"" Putin said at a government meeting in the
northern city of St Petersburg.
 ""We should not do that (implement the rules). And we should
tell our partners that we will not implement anything.""
 Russia's $1.5 trillion economy is by far the largest outside
the 153-member body. Russia had hoped to wrap up negotiations
before the spring session of the WTO's ruling council at the
start of May 2011, but that now looks increasingly unlikely. 
 Putin's WTO comment interrupted a speech by Deputy Economy
Minister Andrei Klepach, who had complained about problems in
the machinery building sector caused by cheap Chinese imports.
 Klepach said Russia's hands were tied by its WTO accession
obligations on the use of import duties to block Chinese
imports.
 ""Tied by what? I told you all a hundred times. We will
implement these rules when we become a fully fledged member.
Until then our hands are free,"" Putin said. 
 A Russian source close to negotiations told Reuters Russia
currently does not have any obligations related to the WTO
accession. 
 ""Our hands are free. We can do whatever we want,"" the source
said. 
 The source said, however, anti-dumping measures, which are
acceptable under the WTO rules, were a more efficient weapon in
competing against cheap imports than customs duties. 
 
 HURDLES 
 Putin took the WTO by surprise in 2009 when he suspended
entry negotiations and said a customs union with ex-Soviet
neighbours Kazakhstan and Belarus took priority. He repeatedly
spoke out in favour of protectionist measures. 
 President Dmitry Medvedev, Putin's partner in Russia's
ruling tandem, has led negotiations on the issue with the United
States, seen as the key decision maker in the WTO. 
 Another problem facing Russia is the hostility of Georgia,
which has said it will block Russian WTO accession if the two
countries, which fought a brief war in 2008, cannot agree on the
question of customs posts in two breakaway Georgian republics.
Putin earlier praised the progress achieved by Medvedev and
Russian WTO negotiators, but his comments on Friday indicate
Russia's most powerful politician is again losing hope of
joining the organisation this year.
 ""As long as we fulfil WTO obligations (while) not being WTO
members, our partners lose all the desire to accept us ... They
will continue to use our possibilities and our markets. The
market costs money and we are giving it away for free,"" he said.
 Medvedev is due to attend the BRIC summit in China next week
where the issue of Russian protectionist measures against
Chinese machinery imports can be raised. 
 U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice-President Joe Biden
have expressed their support for Russia's WTO membership, but a
senior Russian government source close to the negotiating
process said he believed the U.S. had not yet made up its mind.

 * Importers warn of dwindling supplies of fertiliser
 * Concerns rising about future of European potash mines
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck and Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, April 8 (Reuters) - Potash producers in Spain,
Germany and Britain will ask the European Union executive to
keep in place trade barriers to limit rival imports from Belarus
and Russia, an industry official said on Friday.
 German minerals firm K+S and the Spanish and British
operations of Israel Chemicals (ICL) -- represented by a
European producers' group -- will say keeping import duties in
place on Russian and Belarusian potash rather than letting them
expire is essential to protect Europe's remaining producers from
unfair export pricing.
 Soaring global demand for crops to be used for food and
biofuel has made potash fertiliser a sought-after commodity and
triggered an international scramble for secure supplies.
 ""The European Potash Producers Association is in the last
stage of writing the request for an (import duties) extension
and will certainly lodge it by next Wednesday,"" Michael Wudonig,
spokesman for K+S, told Reuters.
 The European Commission must decide whether to accept the
request and then has up to 15 months to make a decision on
extending the duties, which would otherwise expire in July. The
tariffs would remain in force while it considered the matter.
 Though EU output is dwarfed by mines in Canada, Russia,
Brazil and Australia, producers have raised concerns that
closing European mines could make the continent dependent on
foreign supplies of an essential farm input.
 A five-year extension would keep in place the duty-free
ceiling and tariffs of up to 27.5 percent until at least 2016.
EU producers say an extension is crucial to prevent a flood of
the fertiliser drowning their own production.
 
 IMPORTERS FEAR EU FERTILISER SHORTAGE
 EU importers campaigning for an end to the duties say there
is no prospect of expanding domestic potash production to meet
rising demand, and that maintaining the tariffs would increase
input costs for farmers.
 ""The availability of imports at a fair price is a big, big
concern for the farming industry,"" said John Scollay, managing
director of Fintec, which distributes potash from Belarus.
 ""I doubt lifting the measures would immediately result in
lower prices, but it may mitigate price increases, because this
potash market is going to stay very tight,"" Scollay said.
 Tariffs have been in place on potash imports from Belarus
and Russia since 1992, countering what the EU says are illegal
price discounts that threaten EU production.
 The measures were softened in 2006 with the introduction of
a duty-free allowance of about 1.5 million tonnes.
 Prices of potash soared over the last decade to more than
$1,000 per tonne from less than $150, but eased last year to
about $500 as the credit crisis and falling grain prices cut
farmers' spending.
 The arrival of new producers, including Anglo-Australian BHP
Billiton and Brazil's Vale, further eased supply shortages.
 The value of potash as a strategic resource was reflected by
Canada's decision last year to turn down BHP Billiton's $39
billion bid for Canada's Potash Corp, saying the deal would not
benefit Canada.
 Defying European industry's anti-trust concerns, Russia's
anti-monopoly watchdog this week approved the merger of
producers Uralkali and Silvinit.
 European producers are likely to argue that the fusing of
Russia's largest producers -- and the fact that Silvinit already
owns Belarus's main producer -- creates a powerful exporter
whose market share ambitions in Europe should be checked.

 * Brazil, Mexico currencies at over 2-year highs
 * Chile peso firms on bets of 50 bps rate hike next week
 * Brazil real up 0.51 pct, Mexico peso 0.24 pct
 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, April 8 (Reuters) - Latin American
currencies firmed on Friday as the U.S. dollar broadly
weakened, with Brazil's real trading at a more than 2-1/2 year
high and Mexico's peso at its strongest since October 2008.
 The prospect of a U.S. government shutdown due to a budget
deadlock undermined support for the greenback. [ID:nN08295134]
 The United States is seen lagging the European Union's move
to start hiking interest rates, suggesting investors will
continue to be drawn to Latin America's much higher yields.
 Weakness in the yen has also fueled fresh bets on Latin
American currencies, funded with the Japanese currency.
 Brazil's real has surged more than 2 percent this week as
the market brushed off the government's latest efforts to tax
investors paying low interest rates in developed economies
against Brazil's double-digit yields.
 ""The market is still betting on appreciation,"" said Jose
Carlos Amado, foreign exchange trader at brokerage
Renaissance.
 The real  bid 0.51 percent firmer at 1.574 per dollar
and it hit its strongest since August 2008. The currency was
less than 1 percent from trading at its strongest in more than
12 years, when Brazil introduced a floating exchange rate.
 The real surged the most in a single session since June
2010 on Thursday after Brazil introduced a minor tax increase
on foreign borrowing to try to halt the real's appreciation.
The measure was far less drastic than many had feared. For more
see:[ID:nN06227464]
 Analysts are divided whether Brazilian authorities are
willing to allow further appreciation to help contain
inflation, or if they have just run out of good options to
contain the real's gains.
 Some analysts are betting the currency could firm to as
strong as 1.50 per dollar, while others expect gains to be
limited to 1.55 per dollar amid the threat of further
government efforts.
 Mexico's peso  firmed 0.24 percent to 11.7385 per
dollar, pulling back after staking out a fresh intraday high of
11.7124 per dollar.
 Traders pointed to support for the dollar at the 11.70
level, where option barriers are likely layered, and resistance
around 11.78 per dollar.
 The Mexican currency was on track to notch a gain of more
that 0.8 percent this week as the peso enjoys support from
expectations that a recovering U.S. economy will boost demand
for the country's exports.
 Chile's peso  bid up 0.28 percent to 470.60 per
dollar.
 The currency has gained about 1 percent this week, backed
by a rebound in prices for copper, the country's main export,
and bets the country's central bank could deliver another
aggressive interest rate hike next week.
 Data on Friday showed Chilean consumer prices rose in March
at the fastest pace in 18 months, backing expectations that the
central bank could raise its key interest rate next week by 50
basis points, to 4.50 percent. [ID:nN08178268]
 Peru's sol  bid up 0.18 percent to 2.7960 per U.S.
dollar after the country's central bank on Thursday raised its
benchmark interest rate to 4 percent from 3.75 percent, the
fourth straight hike to control inflation.
 The sol was heading for a slight weekly gain after slumping
during the previous two weeks after left-wing nationalist
presidential candidate Ollanta Humala gained momentum in late
March polls.
 This week polls showed Humala may win the first round this
Sunday but struggle in a June 5 run-off. [ID:nN07122940]

 * GDF-Suez, ""strategic companies"" would be nationalised
 * Tighter immigration policy would generate savings 
 
 By Nick Vinocur
 PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - France's far-right National Front
would pull the country out of the euro within six months if it
wins a general election next year and impose heavy levies on
imports to boost French industry, its leader said on Friday.
 Marine Le Pen, a telegenic former lawyer who replaced her
father Jean-Marie Le Pen as party chief this year, launched her
economic policy as some polls show she could beat President
Nicolas Sarkozy in the first round of the April 2012 vote.
 The party's policy calls for restoring the French franc at
parity with the euro, boosting national industry by setting up
border tariffs, and reducing France's debt to 25 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025.
 This would partly be achieved through savings of 40 billion
euro ($57.6 billion) she believes she can glean from tighter
controls on immigration.
""The eurozone is the most absurd economic area in the
world,"" Le Pen told journalists at a floating restaurant near
Paris, opening a tense three-hour briefing that was frequently
interrupted by shouting and tirades by journalists.
 ""The results of this experiment have been catastrophic for
the French people ... If you want to see where this is going,
just look at the examples of Greece and Ireland."" 
 The anti-immigrant party's economic proposals have often
been ridiculed as naive by the French press. 
 But Le Pen's poll ratings exceed those of her father ahead
of the 2002 election, when the party knocked out mainstream
Socialist candidate and former prime minister Lionel Jospin in
the first round of voting. 
 She is now keen to give the National Front a more electable
new image, and has enlisted a team of economic advisors from
academia, the public sector and private financial institutions.
 Many have chosen to remain anonymous. Le Pen refused to
identify the man who presented her economic programme at the
Paris press conference, saying to do so could cost him his job
due to ""intellectual terrorism"".
 
 ""ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM"" 
 She dismissed questions about the danger of withdrawing
unilaterally from the euro, and said if currency markets
rejected the franc, France would set up Iceland-style capital
controls to stop investors pulling their cash out of French
banks and dumping assets. 
 ""Our scenario would not lead to hyperinflation,"" she said,
rising from her chair. 
 ""You cannot just ignore all the economic studies which
clearly deny the fact that a withdrawal from the eurozone would
bring about uncontrolled inflation.""
 Tracfin, a public body with 80 employees, would enforce the
controls, she said.
 To reduce national debt -- now around 80 percent of GDP and
largely owned by foreign investors -- the party would make the
Bank of France buy about 25 percent of the total.
 Households and private banks like BNP Paribas would be made
to shoulder much of the remaining debt.
 As part of her programme of ""economic patriotism"", Le Pen
would nationalise energy firm GDF-Suez and other ""strategic
assets"", impose heavy levies on imports of basic goods like
textiles and give state aid to fledgling companies.
 Asked if she was concerned that such actions might bring
sanctions from the World Trade Organisation, Le Pen said: 
 ""I think France is a great power and that the consequences
of such action would not be quite as terrible as you think.""
 Despite the anti-euro rhetoric, Le Pen did not say France
would withdraw from the European Union -- even it dumps its
currency.
 ""There is no chaos, no apocalypse to fear,"" she said. ""We
will remain in a spirit of cooperation with our European
partners.""

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - Oil rose above $125 a barrel
on Friday to its highest since August 2008 on concerns of
long-term supply cuts, while expectations of more interest rate
hikes in the euro zone drove the euro to a 15-month peak
against the dollar.
 Commodities, including metals, gained broadly on
expectations of stronger demand and, in some cases, the threat
of supply shortages.
 Global equities were boosted by optimism the worldwide
economic recovery will fuel demand for commodities, and shares
hit their highest level in almost three years. U.S. stocks
opened higher but were little changed by late morning.
 Boosted by Thursday's European Central Bank rate hike, the
euro rose to its highest since January 2010. The currency was
last up 0.8 percent at $1.4413 .
 The greenback was also pressured by the prospect of a U.S.
government shutdown, and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose near
six-week highs.
 Republicans and Democrats have been in budget talks trying
to reach an agreement that would avert a government shutdown at
midnight.
 The ECB's move to raise its key interest rate to 1.25
percent has widened the euro zone's yield advantage over the
United States, Britain and Japan, where rates remain at record
lows. For details, see [ID:nLOOKCBANK]
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said policymakers were
ready to tighten further if needed. But he stressed the ECB had
not decided that Thursday's move was the first in a series.
[ID:nLDE7351QH]
 ""Trichet's press conference was neutral and suggests to us
that the bank is embarking on a gradual series of rate
increases of perhaps 25 basis points per quarter,"" said Jon
Wetreich, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 Stronger-than-expected German trade data helped underscore
the health of the euro zone's largest economy, helping
investors sidestep resurgent doubts over the resilience of the
zone following Portugal's request this week for aid to cope
with its debt. [ID:nLDE73707D]

 Brent crude  surged $2.63 to $125.30 per barrel on
the weak dollar and after attacks on Libyan oil fields. Ongoing
unrest in other parts of the world and postponed elections in
Nigeria have also led to a bullish attitude on oil.
 Libyan rebels said they repulsed a government assault on
the besieged city of Misrata but prospects faded for a military
overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. [ID:nLDE7352B6]

 NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a 15-month
high against the dollar on Friday, supported by expectations of
more euro zone interest rate increases, while the prospect of a
U.S. government shutdown pushed the dollar broadly lower.
 The euro was also helped by reported Middle East sovereign
demand.
 The dollar was pressured as the White House and Congress
worked frantically to break a U.S. budget deadlock by the end
of the day in order to avoid a government shutdown. For more,
see: [ID:nN08144565]
 A shutdown will be far reaching, since among other actions
it will stop the payment of government suppliers and possibly
close private enterprises reliant on government operations.
 The lost wages and spending will ripple through to other
areas of the economy at a time of uncertain economic growth,
though some analysts noted that any impact would be short-lived
and government spending for the year would be the same.
 The ECB raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to
1.25 percent on Thursday, and European Central Bank President

 FX market participants interpreted the comments as
signaling progressive rather than aggressive rate hikes ahead,
but analysts said the prospect of another rate rise this summer
would continue to support the euro.
 The euro was up 0.9 percent at $1.4432  with a
session peak of $1.4444.
 Traders said an early break of an option barrier at $1.4430
would target $1.4450, marking the 61.8 percent retracement of
the move from the euro's record high above $1.6000 hit in 2008
to the 2010 low of $1.1876. It would then be in sight of
$1.4500 and the January 2010 high around $1.4580.

 AUSSIE AT POST-FLOAT HIGH
 The Australian dollar rose to its highest level versus the
greenback since it was floated in December 1983. The aussie has
benefited from strong domestic economic growth, staving off the
malaise of the rest of the developed world in recent years,
fueled in large part by exports of raw materials to China.
 The Australian dollar  jumped to a high of
$1.0546.
 ""We're seeing broad-based dollar selling, especially
against currencies with a favorable yield,"" said Carl Hammer,
currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Helped by a rise in oil prices to a 32-month high and the
addition of 90,600 full-time workers to Canadian payrolls
[ID:nN08228750], the Canadian dollar  touched its
strongest level in three and a half years against its U.S.
counterpart. The U.S. dollar was last down 0.2 percent at

 Against the yen, however, the U.S. dollar rose, trading up
0.1 percent at 85 yen , still within striking distance of
a six-month high hit earlier this week.
 The yen touched an 11-month low versus the euro. The euro

 * Pumping of radioactive water into see to end Sunday
 * Beijing to closely monitor Japan's nuclear actions
 * China bans imports of farm products from 12 areas
(Recasts with TEPCO apology, water pumping plans)	
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Chisa Fujioka	
 TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - A Japanese power company
executive apologised on Saturday for spreading radiation into
the air and sea as regulators said the pumping of radioactive
water into waters off Japan from a crippled nuclear plant would
end one day later than planned.	
 The apology from Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO)
came a day after China and South Korea expressed concern at the
discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant
smashed by last month's earthquake, reflecting growing
international unease over the month-long nuclear crisis.	
 ""It is almost a month since the earthquake took place. I
would like to apologise from my heart over the worries and
troubles we are causing for society due to the release of
radiological materials into the atmosphere and seawater,"" Sakae
Muto, a TEPCO vice president, told a news conference.	
 ""We caused worry and trouble for having made this decision
without taking sufficient time to explain the matter beforehand
to those involved, to the press, to the fishing industry and to
people overseas, and we are sorry for this,"" he added.	
 Hidehiko Nishiyama, a deputy director-general at Japan's
Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, earlier told reporters
""we are working on releasing water ... we are likely to finish
this tomorrow.""	
 
 He said a condenser at the No.2 reactor had been emptied of
low-radiation water on Saturday, making room for engineers to
shift highly radioactive water from the reactor's trench.	
 ""To prevent radioactive water in the trench from overflowing
is an important step considering a possible further
contamination of the sea,"" Nishiyama said.	
 Plant operator TEPCO said earlier it expected to stop
pumping tainted water into the sea on Saturday, but work was
interrupted by a powerful aftershock on Thursday.	
 TEPCO is struggling to contain the worst atomic crisis since
Chernobyl. Engineers say they are far from in control of the
damaged reactors and it could take months to stabilise them and
years to clear up the toxic mess left behind.	
 Nuclear reactor maker Toshiba Corp has proposed a
10-year plan to decommission four of the six damaged reactors at
the plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, said Kyodo news
agency.	
 But the government has said it was too early to have a
""specific road map"" for ending the crisis.	
 Nishiyama said Japan would look into the electric power
back-up system that had failed after the tsunami, leaving
operators unable to cool the reactor. ""Based on this experience,
we need to review everything in the direction of safety,"" he
said.	
 The magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11 left
28,000 people dead or missing, and northeastern Japan a
splintered wreck. 
 More than 153,000 people affected by the tsunami and
radiation are living in school gymnasiums and other evacuation
centres, according to the National Police Agency. Several
tsunami-damaged cities have begun moving families into temporary
housing, NHK state television said.	
 Banri Kaieda, a minister whose portfolio includes the
nuclear industry, said he hoped evacuees from the radiation zone
in Fukushima could visit their homes as soon as possible. 
 Japan has made evacuation mandatory for people living within
a 20 km (12-mile) radius of the crippled reactor and urged those
living between 20 km and 30 km from the plant to stay indoors. 
 ""There were expectations among the evacuees that they could
return to their homes for one night, but they will only be able
to stay for a few hours to gather their personal belongings,""
Kaieda was quoted by Jiji news agency as saying in Fukushima.	
 
 GLOBAL RADIATION CONCERNS	
 Several countries have restricted food imports from Japan
over radiation fears as Japan's economy reels from the country's
worst disaster since World War Two.	
 Food is a tiny part of Japan's export-oriented economy, but
disruptions to its manufacturing and electronics supply chains
are reverberating around the world.	
 China will ban imports of farm produce from 12 areas in
Japan, China's quarantine authority said.	
 China said earlier it had detected 10 cases of ships,
aircraft or cargo arriving from Japan with higher than normal
levels of radiation since mid-March. [ID:nL3E7F81JE]	
 Xinhua also reported trace levels of radioactivity had been
detected in 22 Chinese provinces.	
 On Friday, China said it would closely monitor Japan's
actions to regain control of the plant and demanded Tokyo
provide swift and accurate information on the crisis.	
 South Korea has also criticised Japan, accusing it of
incompetence for failing to notify its neighbours that it would
pump radioactive water into the sea.	
 Radiation from Japan spread around the entire northern
hemisphere in the first two weeks of the nuclear crisis,
according to the Vienna-based Preparatory Commission for the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation.

 ECONOMY REELING	
 The world's third largest economy is now in a ""severe
condition,"" the government said on Friday.	
 Finance leaders of the G20 group of countries will ask Tokyo
for a plan to resuscitate its economy as they see the damage
from the earthquake as a risk to global growth, Takatoshi Kato,
a former IMF deputy managing director, told Reuters on Friday.
[ID:nLME7DP00O]	
 Automaker Toyota Motor Corp plans to idle some of
U.S. plants late in April, while Honda Motor Co Ltd has
extended reduced U.S. production until April 22.

 NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - Oil rose to a 32-month high
above $124 a barrel on Friday on concerns of long-term supply
cuts, while expectations of more interest rate hikes in the
euro zone drove the euro to a 15-month peak versus the dollar.
 Commodities, including metals, gained broadly on
expectations of stronger demand and, in some cases, the threat
of supply shortages.
 Global equities were boosted by optimism the worldwide
economic recovery will fuel demand for commodities, and shares
hit their highest level in almost three years. U.S. stocks
opened higher but were little changed by midmorning.
 Boosted by Thursday's European Central Bank rate hike, the
euro rose to its highest since January 2010. The currency was
last up 0.8 percent at $1.4413 .
 The greenback was also pressured by the prospect of a U.S.
government shutdown, and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose near
six-week highs.
 Republicans and Democrats have been in budget talks trying
to reach an agreement that would avert a government shutdown at
midnight. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said budget
negotiators had agreed to $38 billion in spending cuts.
 The ECB's move to raise its key interest rate to 1.25
percent has widened the euro zone's yield advantage over the
United States, Britain and Japan, where rates remain at record
lows. For details, see [ID:nLOOKCBANK]
 ECP President Jean-Claude Trichet said policymakers were
ready to tighten further if needed. But he stressed the ECB had
not decided that Thursday's move was the first in a series.

 ""Trichet's press conference was neutral and suggests to us

 NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - World shares hit their
highest level in almost three years on Friday, while heightened
expectations of more interest rate hikes in the euro zone

LONDON)
 NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a 15-month
high against the dollar on Friday, supported by expectations of
more euro zone interest rate hikes, while the prospect of a
U.S. government shutdown pushed the dollar broadly lower.
 The euro was also helped by reported Middle East sovereign
demand, though traders expected the single currency to struggle
to breach $1.4430, where there was talk of a large option
barrier being defended.
 The dollar was pressured as the White House and Congress
worked frantically to break a U.S. budget deadlock by the end
of the day in order to avoid a government shutdown.
 The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate by
25 basis points to 1.25 percent on Thursday, and the bank's
president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said policymakers were ready to

 FX market participants interpreted the comments as
signaling progressive rather than aggressive rate hikes ahead,
but analysts said the prospect of another rate rise this summer
would continue to support the euro.
 The euro was up 0.8 percent at $1.4413. Traders reported
substantial option-related offers ahead of the $1.4430
barrier.
 A break of this level would target $1.4450, marking the
61.8 percent retracement of the move from the euro's record
high above $1.6000 hit in 2008 to the 2010 low of $1.1876. It
would then be in sight of $1.4500 and the January 2010 high
around $1.4580. 
 AUSSIE AT POST-FLOAT HIGH
 The Australian dollar rose to its highest level versus the
greenback since it was floated in December 1983.
 The Australian dollar jumped to a high of $1.0546.
 ""We're seeing broad-based dollar selling, especially
against currencies with a favorable yield,"" said Carl Hammer,
currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Helped by a rise in oil prices to a 32-month high and the
addition of 90,600 full-time workers to Canadian payrolls, the
Canadian dollar touched its strongest level in three and a half
years against its U.S. counterpart. The U.S. dollar was last
down 0.4 percent at C$0.9546.
 Against the yen, however, the U.S. dollar rose, trading up
0.4 percent at 85.31 yen, still near a six-month high hit
earlier this week.
 The yen hit an 11-month low versus the euro. The euro last
traded up 1.2 percent at 122.96 yen, according to Reuters
data.
 Market players said the yen could weaken further on
interest rate differentials and concerns about the economic
impact from a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan
on March 11.

(Adds detail, wraps in construction data)
 By Sven Egenter and David Milliken
 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - British factory gate inflation
rose to a near two-and-a-half year high in March on soaring food
and energy costs, data showed, adding a fresh twist to the
policy dilemma facing the country's rate-setters.
 Sterling strengthened and government bond prices fell as
markets took the view that the data increased the chances the
Bank of England would raise interest rates next month, after
keeping them at a record low 0.5 percent on Thursday.
 Friday's Office for National Statistics figures showed
producer output prices rose by 5.4 percent, their biggest annual
gain since October 2008 and confounding expectations of a
slowdown to 5.1 percent.
 The data posed an upside risk to economists' forecasts for
March consumer price inflation.
 The BoE faces a dilemma of whether to raise interest rates
at a time when underlying economic growth is weak and inflation
pressures may prove temporary, though the current CPI rate of
4.4 percent is more than double the BoE's target.
 ""What the Bank of England is arguing is that a lot of
the rise (in producer prices) is not something that policy can
do much about,"" said George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche
Bank.
 ""The question is do you then try to weaken the domestic
economy to offset the rise in sterling commodity prices. They
probably will have to raise interest rates relatively soon.""
 Buckley added that there was a strong correlation between
producer prices and consumer prices, and that there was now an
increased upside risk to his above-consensus forecast of 4.5
percent for March CPI data due on Tuesday.
 Citi economist Michael Saunders took a similar view.
 ""The 2 percent inflation target is not acting as a serious
benchmark for companies in their pricing decisions. These strong
cost pressures are likely to be reflected in further
above-target CPI readings in coming months,"" he said.
 
 WEAK CONSTRUCTION
 Separate construction industry data also released by the ONS
on Friday cast doubt on the likely strength of first quarter GDP
data due later in April.
 BoE policymakers wavering over whether to raise rates have
indicated they want to see a strong GDP number to ensure that a
fall in fourth-quarter GDP did not mark the start of a sustained
period of sub-par growth that could put long-term downward
pressure on inflation.
 Construction output volumes were 0.3 percent lower than a
year earlier in February. Citi's Saunders said that the data --
which is not seasonally adjusted -- pointed to construction
lopping 0.3 percentage points off the quarterly GDP growth rate.
 ""This could lead to Q1 GDP growth of 0.3-0.4 percent, versus
our prior estimates of 0.5-0.7 percent. We stress uncertainties
here, but the quirky construction data have played a big role in
the repeated surprises in the provisional GDP data over the last
year. They may do so again,"" he said.
 The disconcerting construction data follows an unexpected
sharp monthly fall in industrial output in February -- albeit
balanced by an unusually strong survey reading for the much
larger services sector.
 The BoE will also have to take into account that the
producer price data suggests there will be upward pressure on
CPI for several more months, adding to the risk that firms and
households may start to lose confidence in the central bank.
 Input price inflation eased to an annual rate of 14.6
percent, down from an upwardly revised February reading of 14.9
percent, which was the highest since October 2008. But this was
still far higher than the forecasts of 12.5 percent.
 Stripping out the effect of rising food and petroleum
prices, core output price inflation slowed slightly to 3.0
percent from 3.1 percent, again a slightly bigger number than
economists had expected.
 Crude oil prices jumped 9.8 percent on the month, their
biggest rise since March 2010, and are now more than a third
higher than a year ago. Domestically produced food costs were
13.0 percent more than a year ago.

 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a 15-month high
against the dollar on Friday, supported by expectations of more
euro zone interest rate hikes, while the prospect of a U.S.
government shutdown pushed the dollar lower across the board.
 The euro rose to $1.4422 on the EBS trading platform, helped
by reported Middle East sovereign demand, though traders
expected it to struggle to breach $1.4430, where there was talk
of a large option barrier being defended.
 The dollar fell to its lowest since December 2009 versus a
basket of currencies as the White House and Congress worked
frantically to break a U.S. budget deadlock by the end of the
day in order to avoid a government shutdown.
 Investors were also lured by the prospect of higher yield as
buoyant equity and commodity prices buoyed their appetite for
taking on risk. This propelled the Australian dollar to a fresh
29-year high versus the greenback and dented the low-yielding
Japanese yen, which hit an 11-month low versus the euro.
 ""For euro/dollar the $1.50 level is a possibility in the
next few months,"" said Dennis van den Bosch, senior portfolio
manager in Henderson Global Investors currency team.
 ""However we don't hold a long euro/dollar position because
the risk/reward profile is not strong enough. For us there is
better risk/reward in being long of currencies such as
Australian dollar at the moment,"" he added.
 The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate by 25
basis points to 1.25 percent on Thursday and the bank's
president Jean-Claude Trichet said policymakers were ready to
tighten further if needed.
 FX market participants interpreted the comments as signaling
progressive rather than aggressive rate hikes ahead, but
analysts said the prospect of another rate rise this summer
would continue to support the euro.
 The euro was up 0.8 percent at $1.4413. Traders reported
substantial option-related offers ahead of the $1.4430 barrier.
 A break of this level would target $1.4450, marking the 61.8
percent retracement of the move from the euro's record high
above $1.6 hit in 2008 to the 2010 low of $1.1876. It would then
be in sight of $1.4500 and the Jan. 2010 high around $1.4580.

 SEARCH FOR YIELD
 The dollar index lost more than half a percent, hitting a
low of 75.100, while the higher-yielding Australian dollar
jumped to a 29-year high of $1.0544.
 ""We're seeing broad-based dollar selling, especially against
currencies with a favourable yield,"" said Carl Hammer, currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Helped by oil prices hitting a 32-month high, the Canadian
dollar also hit its strongest in three and a half years versus
the greenback at C$0.9526.
 The U.S. dollar rose against the yen, however, trading up
0.3 percent at 85.28 yen, near a six-month high of 85.53 hit
earlier this week.
 Market players said the yen could weaken further on interest
rate differentials and concerns about the economic impact from a
massive earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on March 11.
 The euro rose more than 1 percent to an 11-month high near
123 yen, according to Reuters data. This took it well above the
top of the weekly Ichimoku cloud, a widely used
Japanese technical analysis, at around 122 yen. A weekly close
above there would be seen as a buy signal.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2011 07:40AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Big tests lined up for investors," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - The second quarter has started
with a bang as equities, commodities and other riskier assets
have soared. Now come some big tests.
 First, U.S. companies begin a new earnings reporting season
in the coming week and investors will be watching to see not
just how the companies have done -- probably pretty well -- but
how things might shape up in the quarters to come.
 That is not nearly as clear.
 Second, the International Monetary Fund-World Bank spring
meeting should provide a steady stream of updates on the real
strength of the world economy, its inflationary pressures and
general financial stability.
 One key for investors, a week after the European Central
Bank raised interest rates, will be to glean how much things
have ""normalised"", prompting more policymakers to accelerate the
removal of cheap money.
 For the time being, however, financial markets are embracing
risky assets with something akin to passion.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI hit a fresh 33-month high
on Friday, riding out worries ranging from Japan's costly
earthquake and Portugal seeking a debt bailout to the threat of
the budget-less U.S. government shutting down.
 Emerging market stocks, laggards for much of the first
quarter, have been particularly hot, rising as much as 11.6
percent from a March 17 low.
 Some of this has been due to increasing investor confidence
that growth and inflationary pressure in key emerging economies
such as China are being controlled, as exemplified by China's
rate hike during the past week.
 A test of this will come on Friday, when Chinese first
quarter GDP and inflation numbers are due.
 ""We expect Chinese GDP growth to weaken over the course of
the year, staging a soft landing,"" private bank Sarasin said in
a note. ""But there is a long way to go.""
 
 PEAKING?
 MSCI's all-country world stock index has actually risen 103
percent since its financial crisis low in March 2009 -- partly
prompted by a string of sterling corporate earnings seasons.
 The question now is whether these are about to peak.
 The latest season kicks of in the United States in the
coming week with a test of three key sectors -- industrial
production from aluminium giant ALCOA, financials from
investment bank JPMorgan Chase and internet bellwether Google.
 Overall, the U.S. reporting season is expected to be
reasonable. Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research projects first
quarter earnings to have risen 11.5 percent year-on-year.
 This compares, however, to a 37.2 percent increase in the
fourth quarter of last year.
 Some investors, indeed, are beginning to suggest that the
days of robust earnings growth will soon come to an end.
 ""The year-on-year increase now is going to decline into
single digits,"" said Giorgio Radaelli, chief strategist at
wealth manager BSI.
 In a similar vein, UK private bank Coutts told its clients
in the past week that U.S. profit margins may have reached their
peak.
 It is looking for a squeeze from rising input costs. The
price of Brent crude oil, as one example, has risen more than 30
percent so far this year.
 
 IMF/WORLD BANK
 The price of oil and other commodities, meanwhile, have
begin to worry central banks -- epitomised by the ECB's hike in
the past week, its first since 2008.
 The IMF/World Bank spring meeting should provide updates, as
will a G20 fringe meeting of finance ministers and a summit of
leaders from Brazil, Russia, India and China, in China.
 Investors will be looking for any sign that world monetary
policy -- both the quantitative easing money-printing from the
developed world and the unorthodox quantitative tightening
credit curbs designed as a response in many emerging economies
-- needs to normalise and tighten up from here.
 The risk markets recovery of the last two years has been
fuelled by abundant liquidity.
 If that is to dry up, investors will need to be confident
that the world is ""normal"" enough for things to continue.

 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a 15-month high
against the dollar on Friday, supported by expectations of more
euro zone interest rate hikes, while the prospect of a U.S.
government shutdown pushed the dollar lower across the board.
 The euro rose to $1.4422 on EBS trading platform, helped by

it to struggle to breach $1.4430, where there was talk of a

 Technical resistance was also seen at $1.4450 prior to a

concrete fact and not just a possibility,"" said Roberto Mialich,
currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""Euro/dollar is supported by the mix of positive factors for
the euro, with interest rate differentials supporting it, and
negative factors for the dollar"".
 The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate by 25
basis points to 1.25 percent on Thursday and the bank's
president Jean-Claude Trichet said policymakers were ready to
tighten further if needed.
 FX market participants interpreted the comments as signaling

of resistance near $1.4283, its November high and roughly where
it faced trendline resistance drawn from its July 2008 record
high.

 SEARCH FOR YIELD
 The dollar index lost more than half a percent, hitting a
low of 75.100, while the higher-yielding Australian dollar
jumped to a 29-year high of $1.0540. 
 ""We're seeing broad-based dollar selling, especially against
currencies with a favourable yield,"" said Carl Hammer, currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Helped by oil prices hitting a 32-month high, the Canadian
dollar also hit its strongest in three and a half years versus
the greenback at C$0.9532.
 The U.S. dollar rose against the yen, however, trading up
0.3 percent at 85.24 yen, near a six-month high of 85.530 yen
hit earlier this week. 
 Market players said the yen could weaken further on interest
rate differentials and concerns about the economic impact from a
massive earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on March 11.
 ""The dollar and yen are coming under pressure as investors
are more comfortable with risk,"" said Christopher Gothard, head
of FX for Brown Brothers Harriman in Hong Kong.
 The euro rose more than 1 percent to an 11-month high of
122.94 yen, according to Reuters data. This took it well above
the top of the weekly Ichimoku cloud, a widely used
Japanese technical analysis, at around 122 yen. A weekly close
above there would be seen as a buy signal.

 * Does not rule out further G7 joint intervention on forex

 By Leika Kihara	
 TOKYO, April 8 (Reuters) - G20 finance leaders will ask
Japan for a plan to resuscitate its economy as they see the
fallout from last month's devastating earthquake as a risk to
global growth, a former senior IMF official said on Friday.	
 Takatoshi Kato, a former IMF deputy managing director, also
said the yen's recent downtrend was natural as Japanese monetary
policy will be kept ultra-loose even as European and U.S.
central banks move to tighten their grip on credit.	
 Last month's joint G7 intervention to stem sharp yen rises
was an appropriate step aimed at curbing disorderly currency
moves, and further concerted action cannot be ruled out
depending on future market developments, he said.	
 Kato, who served at the IMF until 2009 and still has close
ties with senior financial officials around the globe, said the
G20 nations are keen to hear from Japan how long supply chain
disruptions will last, how big the damage to output will be and
what plan Japan has for overcoming these challenges.	
 ""It's not just a problem for Japan but something that
affects other countries. G20 and G7 nations are very much
interested in how Japan views the risks involved in the
reconstruction process,"" Kato said.	
 ""The Bank of Japan has done what it can and has said it will
continue to take further action when needed. What G20 nations
would like to hear from Japanese authorities is what their
fiscal policy response will be.""	
 Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War Two after
the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami battered its northeast
coast. The government has said material damage alone could reach
$300 billion, although some analysts warn the total cost will be
much higher.	
 Kato said that total fiscal spending for disaster relief and
reconstruction will far exceed that for the Kobe quake in 1995,
making issuance of additional government bonds inevitable.	
 But the government should avoid issuing bonds to finance its
first extra budget and keep bond sales for further emergency
budgets at a level that would not crowd out private-sector fund
demand, he said.	
 ""The government won't be able to meet all the costs with tax
hikes. But finding a source of revenue, albeit temporary to meet
costs for reconstruction, would give a positive message to the
market,"" he said, signalling that a one-off tax hike may be an
option to pay for huge quake-related costs.	
 If bond yields shoot up, the BOJ may need to buy more
government debt from the market to keep borrowing costs from
rising too much, he added.	
 Kato, Japan's former vice finance minister responsible for
international issues including currency markets, said the joint
G7 yen-selling intervention conducted days after the March 11
quake was an appropriate step to counter currency moves that
were deviating from economic fundamentals.	
 ""If necessary, further action cannot be ruled out,"" Kato
said. On what would trigger another move to intervene, he only
said it would depend on market conditions at the time, and
whether movements are disorderly and out of line with
fundamentals.	
 
 EXCESSIVE WEAKNESS	
 Kato said he sees the recent weakness in the yen as natural
given the divergence in monetary policy direction of advanced
economies, but warned that excessive yen weakness would hurt
Japan's economy by pushing up import costs.	
 Asked whether there was room for monetary authorities to
step into the market to stem excessive yen weakness, instead of
yen rises, Kato said: ""That depends on future market moves.""	
 Japanese policymakers are scrambling to contain the damage
from last month's deadly earthquake, which some analysts say may
tip the economy into recession as power supply shortages and
supply chain disruptions hit factory output and business
sentiment.	
 The Bank of Japan eased policy days after the quake and
pledged on Thursday to offer 1 trillion yen ($12 billion) in
ultra-cheap loans to banks in areas hit by the quake.	
 The government is working out a first extra budget to clear
wreckage and provide temporary housing for quake-hit areas.
Ruling party lawmakers indicated that spending under that budget
would total 4 trillion yen, which will be followed by several
emergency budgets with bigger spending.	
 The impact of Japan's earthquake on the global economy will
be among the various topics to discussed when finance chiefs
from the Group of 20 nations meet on April 15 on the sidelines
of IMF meetings.	
 Kato is currently president of the Japan Center for
International Finance, a private think tank with close ties to
Japan's finance ministry.

 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - Strong commodity prices drove
world shares to their highest in almost three years on Friday,
while expectations of further rises in euro zone interest rates
propelled the euro to a 15-month peak against the dollar.
 Caution before the quarterly reporting season kept stock

 Boosted by Thursday's European Central Bank rate hike and
the bank's tough talk on inflation, the euro  rose to its

 ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet signalled that the bank was

he did soften the message somewhat by stressing that the bank
had not decided that the widely expected move was the first in a
series of hikes. 
 ""The language was somewhat on the hawkish side overall. We
expect the ECB to hike another 50 basis points this year with
the risks to this forecast lying on the upside,"" said Goldman

 Expectations of further rate hikes saw the Bund June future

 ""With all the focus recently on debt problems in the euro

U.S. has budget problems of its own, while the euro continues to

 * Deal will require ""ambitious"" fiscal steps, privatisations
 * Portugal funding environment will be ""challenging"" in June
 * Spain spreads steady, ministers say can avoid contagion
 
 (Adds Rehn on banks, details from closing news conference)
 By Krisztina Than and Sakari Suoninen
 GODOLLA, Hungary, April 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone ministers
said Portugal must make deeper budget cuts and privatise state
firms in return for an 80 billion euro bailout the bloc wants to
finalise by mid-May, just weeks before an election and state
funding crunch.
 Portugal bowed to pressure from financial markets and its
European partners this week and became the third euro zone
country after Greece and Ireland to request financial help from
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 Finance ministers from the 17-nation single currency area
met at a palace north of Budapest on Friday to discuss the
details and timeline of a rescue, which has been complicated by
political turmoil in the Iberian nation of 10.5 million.
 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned abruptly
last month after parliament rejected a new round of budget
austerity his minority Socialist government had proposed to help
the country meet its deficit reduction targets.
 He is continuing to serve in a caretaker capacity until new
elections are held on June 5. The main opposition party has
backed his request for aid, but negotiations on an economic
adjustment programme -- a precondition for assistance -- are
likely to be tough as cross-party consensus will be needed.
 ""The preparations will start immediately to reach a
cross-party agreement ensuring that an adjustment programme can
be adopted by mid-May and implemented swiftly after the
formation of a new government,"" European finance ministers said
in a statement.
 They said the programme would be based on three pillars: an
""ambitious"" fiscal adjustment to restore financial
sustainability; growth and competitiveness enhancing reforms
including a far-reaching privatisation programme; and measures
to maintain the liquidity and solvency of the financial sector.
 Inflexible labour laws, red tape in business administration
and high wages and production costs compared to Eastern Europe
and East Asia have undermined Portugal's competitiveness.
 The country has posted meagre growth, with an average annual
expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) of less than 1 percent
over the past decade, according to data from the IMF and the
World Bank.
 
 RISKS FOR SPAIN
 Officials did their best to play down concerns that the
contagion that has spread across the bloc's southern periphery
could now hit Portugal's larger neighbour Spain, which has
scrambled to reform its labour market, pension system and
savings banks this year to avoid a similar fate.
 For now markets appear to be confident Spain can avoid
becoming the fourth euro zone domino to fall.
 The spreads between Spanish bond yields and those of German
benchmarks -- a key measure of investor confidence in Spain's
finances -- were hovering below 1.8 percent on Friday, their
lowest levels in five months.
 Spain's benchmark stock index has climbed 6 percent in the
past three weeks.
 And in a sign of broader confidence in the euro zone, the
single currency pushed up to a 15-month high against the dollar
on Friday after the European Central Bank raised interest rates
by 25 basis points -- the first hike since July 2008.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who also attended the
meeting in Hungary, declined to comment on the euro's strength,
which along with higher rates could undermine the economies of
weak euro zone countries struggling under huge debt piles.
 Because of these risks, investors are continuing to
scrutinise Spain, which has a host of weaknesses -- from high
unemployment and weak growth to a troubled banking sector hit by
the bursting of a property bubble.
 ""It has been clear for a long time that the current stage of
the crisis is a severe combination of sovereign debt and banking
sector fragilities and you cannot solve one without solving the
other,"" said European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
Olli Rehn at the end of the meeting.
 ""The next round of bank stress tests is decisive,"" he said,
referring to tests being run on 90 European banks to gauge their
ability to withstand financial shocks. The results will be
published in June.
 
 ""STARTING POINT""
 Ministers said the measures rejected by the Portuguese
parliament last month would be a ""starting point"" for talks on a
fiscal adjustment programme.
 Rehn told reporters that European officials were confident
Lisbon could manage the country's funding needs this month and
next, but that June, when some 4.9 billion euros in bond
redemptions are due, would be ""more challenging"".
 Officials said it would take 10 days to ensure financing
once the bailout deal was in place, most likely by a meeting of
euro zone finance ministers on May 16.
 The European Commission estimates Lisbon will require about
80 billion euros in aid, roughly the same amount as Ireland but
less than the 110 billion euro package offered to Greece nearly
one year ago. Two thirds of the total would come from European
countries and the remaining third from the IMF.
 Ministers also discussed Greece, reminding Athens of the
importance of sticking to its public deficit targets amid
reports it could fall short for 2010.
 Speculation has grown in recent weeks that Athens may have
to restructure a debt load that will to peak at over 150 percent
of GDP, with senior government officials in the euro zone
conceding in private that such a step may be inevitable.
 But the Greek government and leaders of other euro members
have rejected that talk.

11.8 bln 
 * Both exports and imports rise more than expected
(Adds details, background)	
 BERLIN, April 8 (Reuters) - A surprise surge in imports
outpaced rising German exports in February and cut into the
trade surplus, in a sign of robust demand from Europe's largest
economy.	
 Germany's trade surplus narrowed to 11.4 billion euros, its
lowest level since January 2010 as imports rose over four times
more than expected, the adjusted data from the federal
statistics office showed on Friday.	
 Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the surplus to
rise to 12.5 billion euros, while imports, which grew 3.7
percent, had been seen rising only 0.8 percent.	
 ""This should silence the pessimists a little,"" said Ulrike
Rondorf from Commerzbank, refering to the export rise. ""The
momentum however, has decreased if you compare it with the first
quarters after the slump.""	
 Germany has recovered faster than expected from its deepest
recession since World War Two, and recent indicators show it is
on a steady path of growth despite a debt crisis affecting some
fellow euro zone member states.	
 The stability provided by Europe's largest economy is
underpinning an overall upturn for the continent, and data
increasingly shows it is powering ahead.	
 Industrial orders and production data for February released
this week came in several times above forecasts, while
unemployment fell sharply in March to its lowest level in two
decades while more generous wage settlements leave workers more
inclined to spend.	
 The data has led to upward revisions of economic forecasts.
On Thursday, a twice-yearly estimate from Germany's eight top
economic research institutes showed they now expect 2.8 percent
growth in 2011, a significant step above the government's
current forecast of 2.3 percent.	
 The trade data also showed exports rose 2.7 percent, as
opposed to the consensus forecast for 1.5 percent growth.

 * Risk-on sentiment hurts both dollar and yen

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, April 8 (Reuters) - The yen hit an 11-month low
against the euro and neared a six-month trough versus the dollar
on Friday and was seen poised for more weakness due to widening
yield differentials and concerns Japan's exports may drop after
last month's earthquake.	
 The euro climbed against the yen and touched a 15-month peak
against the dollar, supported by market expectations that the
European Central Bank will raise interest rates further in
coming months after a rate rise on Thursday.	
 Other than its rise against the yen, the dollar came under
broad selling pressure, sliding to a fresh 29-year low against
the Australian dollar, a record trough versus the Singapore
dollar, and a 16-month low against a basket of currencies.	
 ""The dollar and yen are coming under pressure as investors
are more comfortable with risk,"" said Christopher Gothard, head
of FX for Brown Brothers Harriman in Hong Kong. 
 ""There are good signs about the strength of the global
recovery despite events in Japan, and for the moment that is
boosting confidence and boosting risk assets,"" Gothard added.	
 The euro rose 0.7 percent to 122.48 yen , having
touched an 11-month high of 122.630 yen on trading platform EBS.
 The euro poked above resistance near 122 yen on the
weekly Ichimoku chart, a form of Japanese technical analysis
widely used by market players. A buy signal would be confirmed
it the euro finishes the day above that resistance.	
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.4387 , having touched
a 15-month high of $1.4405 earlier in the day. The euro's rise
has extended following its breach this week of resistance near
$1.4283, its November high and roughly where it faced trendline
resistance drawn from its July 2008 record high.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 The yen has slid broadly over the past couple of weeks,
having sharply reversed course after surging to a post-World War
Two record high of 76.25 to the dollar on March 17.	
 That rise in the yen prompted the G7 to intervene jointly to
sell the yen and led to the yen's subsequent fall. That shifted
investors' focus to interest rate differentials and the appeal
of carry trades -- a tactic of selling low-yielding currencies
to fund investment in currencies with higher yields.	
 There was some talk earlier on Friday of yen-selling against
the euro by Japanese brokerages, although others said the move
was fuelled by overseas players with stop-loss of the euro
having added fuel to its rise against the yen.	
 Market players said the yen looked set to weaken further
on the back of interest rate differentials, and concerns about
the economic impact from a massive earthquake and tsunami that
struck Japan's northeast on March 11.	
 ""It looks like the yen will weaken across the board,"" said
Satoshi Okagawa, head of FX and money trading group for Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.	
 ""It is impossible to imagine at this point just how much
Japan's production and exports may fall, but the image is that
this is not the type of market condition that calls for buying
the yen,"" Okagawa said.	
 The yen has been hurt by speculation that Japan's trade
surplus may narrow or fall into a deficit in coming months.	
 Japan's demand for overseas goods and resources may increase
due to rebuilding efforts. Exports are seen likely to decline
after factories and infrastructure were damaged by the March 11
diaster -- a factor that could temper currency hedging by
Japanese exporters and lessen their yen-buying.	
 Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation's Okagawa said there
have been some strong flows recently in Asian currencies against
the yen such as buying of the South Korean won against the yen
.	
 ""Japan has the lowest interest rates, and there is the also
the advantage of being able to capitalise on differences in
economic growth between Asian economies and Japan,"" he said.

 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 85.131 yen
, nearing a six-month high of 85.530 yen hit earlier this
week.	
 Except for its rise against the yen, the dollar was mostly
weaker, with the Australian dollar hitting a fresh 29-year high
of $1.0535 , and the Singapore dollar vaulting to a
record high against the greenback . The dollar index
fell to its lowest since December 2009 at one point.

raise additional resources 
 * Step may be useful in times of global market stress	
 * Well-funded IMF important for global confidence	
 
 WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund said on Thursday it was worth exploring ways that the
global institution could borrow from financial markets at short
notice to raise additional funding for its lending programs.	
 In a paper that looks at progress by the Group of 20 major
economies in reforming the global monetary system, the Fund said
building confidence in the IMF's ability to respond to crises
may warrant looking at alternative ways of fund-raising,
including turning to markets.	
 The G20 meets in Washington next week before semi-annual
meetings of the IMF and World Bank where changes to the global
monetary system will be discussed by finance ministers.	
 ""A more secure and flexible global safety net might require
mobilization of additional resources,"" the IMF said.	
 ""This could have the added advantage of offering a relative
safe haven asset during times of global market stress,"" it
added.	
 The IMF boosted its resources in 2009-10 by turning to
member countries for loans or by raising members' subscriptions
through so-called quota increases. But the IMF paper noted that
the process took time and may not always be politically
feasible.	
 The IMF's largest contributors are facing rising public
debts and slashing budgets at home to try to balance their
budgets, making it politically difficult to make the argument to
voters to lend to international financial institutions.	
 The IMF was called on recently to provide rescue loans
alongside the European Union to Ireland and Greece as they faced
market pressures to fix problems in their economies.	
 On Wednesday, Portugal indicated it was next to ask for
financial help after its borrowing costs rose to unsustainable
levels.	
 
 NEW ROLE FOR SDR	
 Among issues being explored to update the global monetary
system is whether or not to include the Chinese renminbi in a
basket of currencies that make up the IMF's special drawing
rights -- an international reserve asset of the IMF.	
 The basket is currently made up of the dollar, euro, pound
sterling and the yen. Created in 1969, it does not reflect the
rising importance of China.	
 One of the biggest obstacles to the SDR playing a bigger
role in the global financial system was technical challenges and
a ""great deal of consensus-building and policy coordination,""
the IMF report said.	
 The report said most of the ideas being considered to remake
the global monetary system would require more collaboration
among countries. In addition, some proposals would take time to
implement, the report said, suggesting it could be a while
before a new monetary system is rolled out.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, April 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a near
15-month high against the dollar on Friday on the single
currency's widening yield advantage, while oil surged to a
two-and-a-half year high on worries that war in Libya and unrest
in the Middle East will disrupt supplies. 
 Higher oil prices also encouraged money to flow out of the
dollar into the euro and stoked concerns about commodity-fuelled
inflation, helping propel gold to another record.	
 ""So far this year commodities are relatively unshaken by bad
news on the macro front,"" said Yingxi Yu, an analyst at Barclays
Capital. ""The market is comfortable with the expectations of a
recovering global economy with an emphasis on the developed
world rather than the developing world."" 
 Asian shares rose as it appeared a strong aftershock that
struck Japan's earthquake-ravaged northeast late on Thursday had
not done major damage.	
 European and U.S. markets, which had dipped on news of the
aftershock, were expected to open higher, with financial
bookmakers calling Europe's main indexes up 0.5-0.7 percent,
while S&P 500 index futures  pointed to Wall Street gains.	
 
 U.S. Treasury prices fell as the risk of a government
shutdown and resulting disruption to the government debt
programme loomed.	
 U.S. President Barack Obama and congressional leaders failed
to reach a deal on Thursday in a budget row that could see the
federal government closed down at midnight on Friday,
potentially crimping the economic recovery. [ID:nN07296632]	
 The euro rose as high as $1.44 , its highest since
mid-January 2010, bringing its gains for the year to 7 percent.	
 The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate to
1.25 percent on Thursday, as had been widely expected, widening
the euro zone's yield advantage over the United States, Britain
and Japan, where policy rates remain at record lows.	
 ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet signalled the bank was ready
to tighten further if needed to curb inflationary pressures, but
added it had not decided if the move was the first of a series.	
 ""They were not as hawkish as they were after the last
meeting, but there was enough of a message that the ECB will
hike further this year,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of global FX
strategy at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.	
 The euro slid around 20 percent against the dollar between
November 2009 and the middle of last year, but has been on a
broadly appreciating trend since then.	
 The single currency bought around 122.55 yen ,
near an 11-month high. The dollar was around 85.15 yen ,
down from a six-month high around 85.54 yen set on Thursday.

 ""It looks like the yen will weaken across the board,"" said
Satoshi Okagawa, head of FX and money trading group for Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. 
""It is impossible to imagine at this point just how much
Japan's production and exports may fall, but the image is that
this is not the type of market condition that calls for buying
the yen.""

 EMERGING MARKETS ROAR	
 U.S. And European stocks fell around 0.2 percent after a 7.4
magnitude earthquake shook the northeast of Japan's main island,
which was devastated by a massive 9.0 magnitude quake and
tsunami four weeks ago. 
 Tokyo's Nikkei share average opened lower, but
rebounded strongly to close up 1.9 percent as it seemed the
latest quake had not caused major damage. 
 The Nikkei has regained more than two-thirds of the losses
sustained in the immediate aftermath of the March 11 quake, but
investors remain concerned about the impact on corporate profits
after it knocked out production and crippled a nuclear plant.	
 ""People are buying shares for now, but it's not going to
last long,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management.	
 ""Fundamentals remain unclear and extreme uncertainty
surrounding earnings, with many firms set not to provide annual
forecasts will keep a lid on the market's gains."" 
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.6 percent, recording the latest in a
series of near three-year highs it has struck over the past
week.	
 After a patchy start to the year -- in part due to concerns
about policy tightening in response to energy and food-led
inflation -- emerging markets have roared back in recent weeks.	
 Data from Lipper on Thursday showed a net inflow of $2.7
billion into emerging market equities in the week to April 6,
the fourth-highest weekly total since the fund tracker began
compiling the data in 1992. [ID:nN07259168]	
 U.S. crude  rose more than $1 to hit $111.28 a barrel
and Brent crude  went as far as $123.65, both the highest
since August 2008. 
 ""Oil prices are at a point where we could begin to see
demand destruction,"" said Mike Wittner, head of commodities
research at Societe Generale. 
 ""It already looks like the United States may just be showing
some signs of demand destruction. The United States is always
the country where you see the impact the most because there are
no subsidies and hardly any tax burden."" 
 Unrest in the Arab world has added a $20-25 premium to oil
prices since the toppling of regimes in Tunisia and Egypt in the
last few months, Wittner said. 
 Gold rose to $1,466.40 an ounce, the latest in a
series of records. Gold is popular with investors both as a
hedge against inflation and a falling dollar and a safe haven at
a time of geopolitical uncertainty. 
 Japanese government bonds edged lower, with benchmark
10-year futures <2JGBv1> down 0.10 point and the 10-year yield
up 1 basis point at 1.315 percent.

 * No decisions likely before EU/IMF mission to Portugal

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BUDAPEST, April 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
will discuss Portugal's bailout plea on Friday, including how
much it needs and what reforms it could do in return, but no
firm decisions are likely yet, euro zone sources said.
 Portugal on Wednesday became the third euro zone country
after Greece and Ireland to ask for financial help from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund after its
borrowing costs rose to unsustainable levels following the
collapse of the government of Jose Socrates in March.
 Euro zone finance ministers meet informally in Budapest to
discuss the response to the sovereign debt crisis, but the focus
of the relatively short meeting will be on Portugal.
 ""The ministers are likely to listen to what the Portuguese
finance minister has to say about the economic and political
situation,"" one euro zone source involved in the preparation of
the meeting said. 
""They will then probably ask the European Commission, the
European Central Bank and the IMF to send a mission to Portugal
to establish the modalities of the bailout,"" the source said.
 Under EU rules, such a mission to a country requesting
financial aid is necessary to establish the parameters of the
support programme, which would then be put into a memorandum of
understanding signed by Portugal and the European Commission.
 Two other euro zone sources, however, said the ministers
were likely to have a preliminary talk on some of the key
elements.
 ""They are likely to discuss how much, roughly, Portugal
needs, when, and what it might do in terms of reforms,"" a second
euro zone source involved in the preparations said.
 The source said the amount of the bailout was likely to be
in the higher end of the 60-80 billion euros, possibly 85
billion euros, but it was one of the issues that a mission to
Portugal would establish.
 
 REFORMS
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, mindful of the
concerns among taxpayers in affluent Germany already bearing the
brunt of existing bailouts for Greece and Ireland, pointed out
that such aid could only be granted in return for tough reforms.
 Calling it a ""sensible and necessary step"", Schaeuble said
in a statement that within the current bailout mechanism, aid
was only available in return for ""an adjustment programme"". 
 The first euro zone source said that it was likely the EU
would ask Portugal for a similar tightening package as was
rejected by the Portuguese parliament in March, but with changes
to accommodate the objections of the opposition.
 The ministers may also discuss the interest rate that the
European Financial Stability Facility will charge for its loans.
 A euro zone source said on Wednesday that the interest was
likely to be in line with what was legally binding at the moment
of issuance. 
 Interest on EFSF loans is likely to fall by 100 basis points
only in June, once euro zone leaders give their final approval
to a package of measures to end the sovereign debt crisis.
 Portugal's aid request is closely watched across Europe,
especially in countries that have either already sought help --
Greece and Ireland -- or see it as a risk, such as Spain. 
 Euro zone officials hope the bailout of Portugal will
finally draw a line under the euro zone sovereign debt crisis.
 ""I think Portugal was probably the last of the group of
countries which were really vulnerable and the market were
really sceptical whether they can survive or not,"" Finnish
Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen told Sky News.
 ""And now when we see that Spain has done a good job, they
have done reforms, they have done expenditure cuts and some tax
raises, so Spain has regained confidence a lot,"" Katainen said.
 ""And now when we take whatever is needed to stabilise the
market by helping Portugal or by putting them to the IMF-EU
programme I think the situation will become calmer,"" he said.
 The economic situation in Ireland after the latest round of
stress tests of the country's financial sector will also be
discussed as will reports of Greece's bigger than expected
budget deficit in 2010.
 The euro zone ministers will be joined later on Friday by
colleagues from non-euro zone European Union countries and by
central bank governors.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets
slipped after a second earthquake rocked Japan on Thursday,
while the euro retreated against the U.S. dollar after the
European Central Bank raised interest rates but signaled it was
not necessarily the start of a round of hikes.
 U.S. and European stocks ended lower after an earthquake
measuring 7.4 shook northeast and eastern Japan. A tsunami
warning was issued for the northeastern coast but later lifted.
For details, see [ID:nL3E7F72Y2]
 However, Wall Street stocks ended off their lows for the
day as better-than-expected sales reported by major retailers
and good weekly jobs data boosted optimism for a sustained
economic recovery.
 European stocks ended down 0.2 percent and the S&P 500
finished down 0.15 percent. U.S.-dollar denominated Nikkei
futures  were down 1.6 percent. Japan is the world's
third-largest economy and investors feared the new quake could
harm the global recovery with some manufacturers' supplies from
Japan already interrupted.
 ""It got people thinking that maybe this is not finished
yet, and this is of a bigger scale than what we had expected,""
said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory
Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
 European shares had earlier gained after Portugal's request
for European aid fostered hopes the region's debt crisis may be
closer to an end. The pan-European European FTSEurofirst 300
stock index <.FTEU3> was down 0.2 percent. Portugal's stock
market bucked the trend, with the PSI 20 <.PSI20> index up 1.2
percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slipped 17.26
points, or 0.14 percent, to 12,409.49. The Standard & Poor's

or 0.13 percent, to 2,796.14.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were off
0.3 percent.
 ""CLOSE TO THE VEST""
 The ECB raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter
percentage point to 1.25 percent to counter rising inflation.
But ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said it was not
necessarily the start of a series of rate hikes, disappointing
some who had expected a more hawkish tone. [ID:nLDE7351QH]
 The euro  was last down 0.3 percent at $1.4292, off a
more than 14-month high of $1.4350 touched on Wednesday.
 Spot gold  hit a new record at $1,464.80 an ounce
following Trichet's comments before easing back to trade
slightly higher.
 ""His tone is decidedly neutral right now. He's keeping
things very close to his vest,"" said Boris Schlossberg,
director of research at GFT in New York, referring to Trichet's
comments. ""The euro trade has been so focused on interest rate
differentials, so some of the fast money might come out of the
trade.""
 It was the first rate increase since 2008 and followed a
day after Portugal's caretaker government requested European
Union aid at the urging of leading bankers. They wanted a
bailout to help the economy and safeguard its banking system.
 Portugal said it will make the formal request for aid later
on Thursday. The rescue package could reach 85 billion euros
($122 billion). [ID:nLDE7361H1]
 Spain vowed it would not follow Portugal in seeking a
bailout. A successful Spanish bond auction suggested markets do
not fear contagion at the moment. [ID:nLDE7360Y7]
 Investors got more signs of a firming labor market as new
U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly more than
expected last week. Other data showed March was not as bad as
expected for many U.S. retailers even in the face of higher
gasoline prices and retail stocks rose. [ID:nN0784911]
[ID:nN07294366]
 Among commodities, spot gold was up 0.1 percent in late
trade after hitting a new peak. Chicago corn futures 
reached a fresh all-time high at $7.73-1/4 before ending lower
ahead of the USDA's April supply/demand report early on Friday.
 Oil prices ended at 2-1/2-year highs as supply worries due
geopolitical turmoil overshadowed demand concerns. U.S. May
crude futures  closed up $1.47 at $110.30 a barrel, the
best since Sept. 22, 2008.

 By Michael O'Boyle and Luciana Lopez
 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, April 7 (Reuters) - Brazil's real
surged on Thursday on bets Brazilian policymakers would allow
more currency gains in order to offset inflation pressures,
with some eyeing room for a jump further to 1.50 per dollar.
 The real had its biggest jump since June 2010 as it rose to
its strongest against the dollar since August 2008.
 Brazil announced a minor tax increase on foreign borrowing
on Wednesday to try to halt the real's appreciation, but the
measure was far less drastic than many had feared. For more,
see:[ID:nN06227464]
 Brazil has tried a variety of measures to slow the real's
gains, with limited success. More severe capital controls could
push investors out of Brazil, while further currency strength
could help contain the impact of rising commodity prices.
 ""The government appears to have decided to allow the
currency to appreciate a bit more and see how beneficial for
inflation expectations it could actually be,"" said Marcelo
Salomon, chief economist for Brazil at Barclays Capital in New
York.
 Data showed consumer prices in Brazil rose more expected in
March, pushing the annual inflation rate near the top of a
government ceiling. [ID:nN07268340]
 The real  bid nearly 1.9 percent stronger to 1.582
per dollar.
 Finance Minister Guido Mantega announced another press
conference at 6:30 p.m. local time (2130 GMT) on Thursday,
raising some concerns further measures could be introduced.
 TARGETING 1.50
 Miriam Tavares, currency director at brokerage AGK
Corretora in Sao Paulo, said the real would likely trade
between 1.55 and 1.60 per dollar in the coming session.
 Analysts at RBS Securities and Barclays Capital both see
the real firming to as strong as 1.50 per dollar.
 Low interest rates in major developed economies like the
United States and Japan will keep up the allure of Brazil's
double-digit debt yields, while higher prices for commodities,
like Brazil's key exports of soybeans and iron, will further
back Latin American currencies, analysts said.
 ""You see commodity prices moving up, and you will see more
flows into Brazil,"" Salomon added.
 Still, a widening current account deficit and expectations
the U.S. central bank will eventually start to withdraw
liquidity could cause Brazil's real to weaken slightly over the
next year, a Reuters poll showed. [ID:nN06201367]
 Mexico's peso managed to stake out a 2-1/2 year intraday
high, at 11.7615 per dollar, before paring back. The currency
is supported by expectations an improving U.S. economy will
boost demand for local exports.
 Mexico sends around 80 percent of its exports to its
northern neighbor. While Mexico is expected to keep interest
rates on hold for at least most of this year, investors are
still drawn to yields that are higher than in developed
markets.
 The Mexican peso  firmed 0.21 percent to 11.7750 per
dollar.
 Chile's peso  bid 0.38 percent firmer at 471.90 per
dollar, its strongest in six weeks, supported by a rebound in
prices for copper, the country's main export. [ID:nLDE7360VP]
 Also backing bets for an aggressive interest rate hike this
month, the central bank's president said on Thursday that
Chile's economy will grow close to its full capacity this year.
[ID:nN07109118]
 Peru's sol  bid up 0.43 percent to 2.8010 per U.S.
dollar on Thursday on news that a poll showed right-wing
populist Keiko Fujimori would face left-wing nationalist
Ollanta Humala in a June 5 run-off. [ID:nN07122940]
 The first-round vote will be held on Sunday. The sol has
weakened in recent weeks on worries about a Humala victory.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell from a 14-month
high against the dollar on Thursday after the head of the
European Central Bank dampened market expectations for
aggressive interest rate hikes, though any pullback was
expected to be limited.
 The euro also dropped against the yen, which rallied across
the board after a new Japanese earthquake with a magnitude of
7.4 prompted investors to close trades in riskier investments
funded by cheaply borrowed yen.
 The ECB raised rates by 25 basis points, its first hike
since the 2008 financial crisis, to battle rising inflationary
pressures. ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet signaled the bank was
ready to tighten policy further if needed but added that the
ECB had not decided if Thursday's move was the first in a
series.
 ""His tone is decidedly neutral right now. He's keeping

differentials, so some of the fast money might come out of the

 The euro was last down 0.3 percent at $1.4292, off a more
than 14-month high of $1.4350 touched on Wednesday. Options
traders noted demand for short-term upside strikes in the
$1.4400 region, as market players looked to protect against a
further rise in the euro.
 Some analysts said the euro could fall as low as $1.4200,
though losses should be limited to $1.40, given uncertainty
over the outlook for U.S. monetary policy.
 The euro zone single currency has risen more than 3 percent
since March 3, when Trichet strongly hinted at a rate hike in
April, earlier than markets had then been expecting.

 Investors also were cautious about the euro zone's debt
crisis after Portugal asked for a bailout from the European
Union, with the size of the package expected to be up to 80
billion euros ($114 billion). But fears of contagion to Spain
eased somewhat after Madrid comfortably sold 4.1 billion euros
of a new three-year bond.
 ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE
 Against the yen, the dollar fell to a session low of 84.57
yen after news of the latest earthquake in Japan. It was last
at 84.88 yen, down 0.7 percent. Stop-loss orders were triggered
below 84.70.
 ""This could cause some risk aversion to sneak back into the
market, but given how other currencies have been screaming
higher against the yen since mid-March, the scope for
profit-taking was always there around these levels,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 No damage was detected at the quake-shattered Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear plant, operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said. A
tsunami warning was also lifted.
 The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as expected
and signaled its readiness to ease policy further, bucking a
global trend of central banks withdrawing excess liquidity put
in place during the financial crisis.

(Updates prices, adds quotes, details)
 NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell from a 14-month
high against the dollar on Thursday after the head of the
European Central Bank dampened market expectations for
aggressive interest rate hikes, though any pullback was
expected to be limited.
 The euro also dropped against the yen, which rallied across
the board after a new Japanese earthquake with magnitude of 7.4
prompted investors to close trades in riskier investments
funded by cheaply borrowed yen. For more, see [ID:nL3E7F72Y2]
 The ECB raised rates by 25 basis points, the first hike
since the 2008 financial crisis, to battle rising inflationary
pressures. ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet signaled the bank was
ready to tighten policy further if needed, but he added that
the ECB had not decided if Thursday's move was the first in a
series. See [ID:nLDE7351QH]
 ""His tone is decidedly neutral right now. He's keeping
things very close to his vest,"" said Boris Schlossberg,
director of research at GFT in New York, referring to Trichet's
comments. ""The euro trade has been so focused on interest rate
differentials, so some of the fast money might come out of the
trade.""
 The euro was last down 0.3 percent at $1.4292 , off a
more than 14-month high of $1.4350 touched on Wednesday.
Options traders noted demand for short-term upside strikes in
the $1.4400 region, as market players looked to protect against
a further rise in the euro.
 Some analysts said the euro could fall as low as $1.4200,
though losses should be limited to $1.40, given uncertainty
over the outlook for U.S. monetary policy.
 The single currency has risen more than 3 percent since
March 3, when Trichet strongly hinted at a rate hike in April,
earlier than markets had then been expecting.

 Investors also were cautious about the euro zone's debt
crisis after Portugal asked for a bailout from the European
Union, with the size of the package expected to be up to 80
billion euros ($114 billion). See [ID:nLDE7350HL] But fears of
contagion to Spain eased somewhat after Madrid comfortably sold
4.1 billion euros of a new three-year bond.
 ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE
 Against the yen, the dollar fell to a session low of 84.57
yen  after news of the latest earthquake in Japan. It was
last at 84.86 yen, down 0.7 percent. Stop-loss orders were
triggered below 84.70.
 ""This could cause some risk aversion to sneak back into the
market, but given how other currencies have been screaming
higher against the yen since mid-March, the scope for
profit-taking was always there around these levels,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 No damage from the quake was detected at the Fukushima
Daiichi plant, operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO)
<9501.T> said. A tsunami warning was also lifted. See

 Earlier, the dollar rose to a six-month high of 85.54 yen
in Asia, almost 10 yen above its record low of 76.25 yen hit in
March, days after Japan's devastating earthquake.
 The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as expected
and signaled its readiness to ease policy further, bucking a
global trend of central banks withdrawing excess liquidity put
in place during the financial crisis. [ID:nL3E7F70JG]

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
pause for a couple of months before raising interest rates again
in July, according to a Reuters poll taken after the bank raised
interest rates for the first time in nearly three years.
 Nearly half of 62 economists polled said the ECB would not
tighten monetary policy further until July, when it would make
another 25 basis point increase to 1.50 percent. Ten said it
would act in June while 12 said it would hold off until the
third quarter.
 The consensus estimate is in line with expectations
currently priced into financial markets.
 ""The Governing Council will continue to 'monitor very
closely all developments', which likely rules out a rate hike as
soon as in May, but leaves the door open for the next move to
occur in June or in July,"" said Frederik Ducrozet at CA-CIB. He
was referring to comments by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
after Thursday's rate rise.
 The ECB was the first of the big four central banks to act
when it increased rates by 25 basis points from a record low of
1.0 percent. 
 Trichet, however, said it was not necessarily the start of a
series of similar steps.
 Median forecasts from the poll predicted interest rates
would end the year at 1.75 percent, also in line with
expectations in financial markets. Rates are set to end 2012 at
2.5 percent, unchanged from a poll taken last week.
 Before Trichet shocked markets at the March ECB press
conference by strongly hinting rates would rise in April,
economists had not expected rates to rise until the fourth
quarter of this year.
The latest poll underscored the divergent policy paths of
major central banks. The Bank of England left rates on hold at a
record low of 0.5 percent on Thursday, as expected almost
unanimously in a Reuters poll.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve, which is still in the midst of a
$600 billion bond purchase programme to stimulate the economy,
is not seen raising the federal funds rate from a record low of
0-0.25 percent until early next year.
 China, in contrast, raised rates on Tuesday for the fourth
time since October, extending a long-term term fight against
inflation.
 
 TROUBLE IN THE BLOC
 The ECB adopted a loose monetary policy two years ago to
kick-start an economy going through the worst downturn since the
Second World War but is now facing inflation running
significantly above its 2 percent target ceiling.
 Prices in the 17-nation bloc rose by an estimated 2.6
percent year-on-year in March and could increase further given
rising oil prices.
 But while the euro zone economy grew 0.3 percent in the
final three months of last year, and is expected to have grown
0.5 percent in the current quarter, recent data suggests an
upturn in Germany is masking a struggling periphery. [EUR/PMIS]
 ""The hike is unwelcome for peripheral countries, but
arguably the core member states were in need of this move
already some time ago,"" said Nick Kounis at ABN AMRO.
 Portugal requested an EU-led bailout, estimated at about
60-80 billion euros, on Wednesday with Lisbon saying the risks
to the economy had now become too great to go it alone after
Portuguese borrowing rates soared in recent weeks.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - Global equities fell after a
strong earthquake shook Japan and the euro fell against the
dollar as the European Central Bank raised rates but signaled
it was not necessarily the start of a round of hikes.
 U.S. and European stocks fell after the earthquake
measuring 7.4 shook northeast and eastern Japan. A tsunami
warning was issued for the northeastern coast, an area badly
hit by March's earthquake. For details, see [ID:nL3E7F72Y2]
 European stocks ended down 0.2 percent and the dollar
extended losses against the yen. Nikkei futures were down 1.8
percent. Japan is the world's third-largest economy and
investors feared the new quake could harm global recovery.
 ""We started to drop on this earthquake news out of Japan.
It seems to be generating a bit of jitteriness and has caused
people to take a bit of profit,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior
equity index analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
 ""In a couple hours from now if it looks like damage is
minimal, the market the will go back to trading economics as
opposed to earthquakes.""
 European shares had earlier gained after Portugal's request
for aid fostered hopes the region's debt crisis will be
staunched. The pan-European European FTSEurofirst 300 stock
index <.FTEU3> was down 0.2 percent. Portugal's stock market
bucked the trend, the PSI 20 <.PSI20> index up 1.2 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 36.63
points, or 0.29 percent, to 12,390.12. The Standard & Poor's

points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,798.87.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> gave up
0.3 percent.
 RATE HIKE
 The ECB raised rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent to
counter firming inflation pressures. ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet said it was not necessarily the start of a series of
similar steps, disappointing some who had expected a more
hawkish tone. [ID:nLDE7351QH]
 ""This makes the ECB the first major developed economy
central bank to hike rates, and the decision will cement its
reputation as a single-minded inflation fighter,"" said ABN Amro
economist Nick Kounis.
 ""The hike is unwelcome for peripheral countries, but
arguably the core member states were in need of this move
already some time ago. In that sense, the timing of the
increase is a balancing act, which is part and parcel of the
one-size-fits-all monetary policy,"" he added.
 The euro  was down 0.5 percent on the day at $1.4268,
off a more than 14-month high of $1.4350 touched on Wednesday.
Spot gold  hit a new record at $1,464.80 an ounce
following Trichet's comments.
 It was the first rate increase since 2008 and followed a
day after Portugal's caretaker government requested European
Union aid at the urging of leading bankers. They wanted a
bailout to help the economy and safeguard its banking system.
 Portugal said it will make the formal request for aid later
on Thursday. The rescue package could reach 85 billion euros
($122 billion). [ID:nLDE7361H1]
 Spain vowed it would not follow Portugal in seeking a
bailout. A successful Spanish bond auction suggested markets do
not fear contagion at the moment. [ID:nLDE7360Y7]
 Investors got more signs of a firming labor market as new
U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly more than
expected last week. Other data showed March was not as bad as
expected for many U.S. retailers even in the face of higher
gasoline prices. [ID:nN0784911] [ID:nN07294366]
 Among commodities, spot gold was recently bid at $1,464.12
an ounce after hitting a new peak, while Chicago corn futures
 reached a fresh all-time high at $7.73-1/4 before falling
from the peak.

 NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday after the president of the European Central
Bank said the ECB had not decided if its expected interest rate
hike earlier in the day was the first in a series..
 The yen rose to a session peak against the dollar after a
Japanese earthquake with magnitude of 7.4 that shook northeast
and eastern Japan and resulted in a tsunami warning for the
northeastern coast..
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet later qualified his
remarks by saying the bank always does what it judges as
necessary, but the remarks were not hawkish enough for some
investors who had been betting on at least two further rate
increases this year..
 Trichet spoke at a press conference after the ECB raised
rates for the first time since July 2008 by 25 basis points to
1.25 percent.
 ""His tone is decidedly neutral right now. He's keeping
things very close to his vest,"" said Boris Schlossberg, head of

 Some say the euro could fall as low as $1.4200.
 ""The euro trade has been so focused on interest rate

 The single currency has risen more than 3 percent since
March 3, when Trichet's comments strongly hinted at a rate hike
in April, earlier than markets had then been expecting.
 EARTHQUAKE
 Against the yen, the dollar fell to a session low of 84.57
yen after reports of the latest earthquake in Japan reached
investors, before climbing back to 84.79 yen, down 0.8 percent.
Stop-loss orders were triggered below 84.70.
 Engineers working at Tokyo Electric Power Co's Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was badly damaged by the
March 11 quake and is leaking radiation, have been evacuated,
officials of operator Tokyo Electric told a televised news
conference..
 The company said there were no irregularities at its
Fukushima Daini plant, which has been shut down since the March
11 quake.
 ""This could cause some risk aversion to sneak back into the
market, but given how other currencies have been screaming
higher against the yen since mid-March, the scope for
profit-taking was always there around these levels,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 Earlier, the dollar rose to a six-month high of 85.54 yen
in Asia, almost 10 yen above its record low of 76.25 yen hit in
March, days after Japan's devastating earthquake.
 Earlier, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as
expected and signaled its readiness to ease policy further,
bucking a global trend of central banks withdrawing excess
liquidity put in place during the financial crisis.
 The euro fell more than 1 percent on the day against the
yen, hitting the day's low around 120.74 yen, with traders
citing real money selling of euros. It was last down 1.2
percent at 121.03.
 SPANISH AUCTION
 The currency market was also cautious as Portugal moved to
seek a bailout from the European Union, with the size of the
package expected to be up to 80 billion euros ($114 billion).
 Fears that Spain may be the next on the market's radar for
its debt problems eased somewhat after Madrid comfortably sold
4.1 billion euros of a new three-year bond.
 Expectations for higher euro zone rates contrasted with
uncertainty in the United States over when the Federal Reserve
may begin to tighten policy.
 The Bank of England kept rates unchanged, as expected.
 Sterling slipped against the dollar after the decision as
some had positioned themselves for the slim chance of a rate
rise.. Sterling was last down 0.2 percent to $1.6301.
 The Australian dollar scaled a fresh post-float high

(Recasts throughout)	
 By Yoko Kubota and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 8 (Reuters) - China said on Friday it was
concerned at Japan pump ing radioactive water
into the sea from its crippled nuclear power plant, reflecting
growing international unease at the month-long crisis triggered
by a massive earthquake and tsunami.
China will ""closely"" monitor Japan's actions to regain control
of the plant, the foreign ministry said, demanding Tokyo provide
swift and accurate information on the crisis which began on
March 11 when a magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami struck.	
 The comments came as a Chinese quality watchdog said it had
detected 10 cases of ships, aircraft or cargo arriving from
Japan with higher than normal levels of radiation since
mid-March. [ID:nL3E7F81JE]	
 While Japan struggles to regain control of the nuclear plant
in the worst crisis since Chernobyl, it also faced calls to
revive its economy, rocked by the triple disaster, to prevent a
knock-on impact on the global economy.	
 G20 finance leaders will ask Tokyo for a plan to resuscitate
its economy as they see the fallout from the earthquake a risk
to global growth, Takatoshi Kato, a former IMF deputy managing
director, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
[ID:nLME7DP00O].	
 The tsunami left 28,000 people dead or missing, damaged six
nuclear reactors north of Tokyo and left Japan's northeast coast
a splintered wreck. The world's third largest economy is now in
a ""severe condition"", the Japanese government said on Friday.	
 A major 7.1 aftershock on Thursday night rocked Japan's east
coast killing three people, injuring 141 others, leaving four
million homes without power and prompting a brief evacuation of
workers from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.	
 Operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) said there
had been no damage to its plant, which until two days ago was
leaking highly radioactive water into the sea. But engineers are
pumping low-level radioactive seawater, used to cool overheated
fuel rods, back into the sea due to a lack of storage capacity.	
 ""As Japan's neighbour, we naturally express our concern
about this,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in
a statement.	
 ""We ask that Japan reports the relevant information to the
Chinese side in a swift, comprehensive and accurate way.""	
South Korea also weighed in o n
Thursday, accusing Japan of incompetence for
failing to notify its neighbour it would pump radioactive water
into the sea. 
 ""They should have given notice but didn't, perhaps
because they just didn't get around to think of it, but it is a
question of their incompetence,"" Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik
said in answer to a question in
parliament. 
 
 
 ECONOMY REELING	
 Several countries have banned or restricted food imports
from Japan over radiation fears and some South Korean schools
have closed fearing toxic rain.	
 Compounding Tokyo's problems, Japan's economy is reeling
from the worst disaster since World War Two and the disruption
to Japanese supply chains is reverberating around the world, 
 Power blackouts and restrictions, factory
shutdowns, and a sharp drop in tourists have hit the world's
most indebted nation, which is facing a damages bill as high as
$300 billion, making it by far the world's costliest natural
disaster.	
 Many economists expect Japan to slip into recession this
year, and the central bank warned on Friday power shortages and
supply disruptions will leave the economy weak for some time.	
 The Cabinet Office's assessment was equally bleak after
releasing a survey reflecting the first glimpse of damage to
business and consumer sentiment. 
 ""Japan's economy is suddenly in a severe condition due to
the effects of the earthquake,"" it said after releasing a
monthly survey of hotel workers, restaurant staff and taxi
drivers that showed a record fall in confidence to levels last
seen during the depths of the global financial crisis. 
 In an obvious sign of the downturn; taxis park in long lines
in central Tokyo each night, their drivers staying warm by
idling the motor as they wait forlornly for a fare.	
 Some ministers at Friday's cabinet meeting called for an end
to a campaign of ""jishuku"" (self restraint) by ordinary people
that was adopted immediately after March 11 to cut fuel or
electricity use and discourage stockpiling of necessities.	
 The Tokyo area and regions further north make up half of
Japan's economy, Nomura research shows. Thursday's aftershock
forced two companies, including electronics giant Sony Corp
, to stop production due to power cuts.	
 On a brighter note, Japan's top automakers Toyota
Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co plan to resume
production at all domestic factories in stages starting on
Monday, but output levels will be at half of original plans.
[ID:nL3E7F81GD]	
 
 NO CHANGE IN RADIATION	
 Japanese nerves were further rattled on Friday when the
overnight aftershock saw partial power lost at the Onagawa
nuclear plant, which is in cold-shut down, and a brief water
leak from spent fuel rod pools.[ID:nL3E7F80BF]	
 But Japan's nuclear safety agency said it had not detected
any change in radiation levels. 
 The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog sounded an encouraging note when
one of its officials said there were signs of progress in
stabilising the Fukushima plant, though the situation remained
very serious.	
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had
not detected any change in radiation levels following Thursday
night's quake. [ID:nLDE736288]	
 ""The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant
remains very serious ... (but) there are early signs of recovery
in some functions such as electrical power and instrumentation,""
the IAEA's head of nuclear safety, Denis Flory, said.	
 The agency said radiation in the region around the plant, as
measured by gamma dose rates, had peaked in the early days of
the crisis, and aside from a rise on March 22, had since fallen
to ""a level very close to background"".	
 Utility TEPCO said it was continuing to inject nitrogen into
one of its Fukushima reactors to prevent a repeat of last
month's hydrogen explosions.	
 Officials say it could take months to bring the reactors
under control and years to clear up the toxic mess left behind.	
 The government has set up a 20-km (12-mile) exclusion zone
around the plant, banned fishing along much of the northeast
coast and set up evacuation centres for the tens of thousands
forced to leave their homes following the crisis.	
China's health ministry said this week traces of
radioactivity had been found in spinach in three provinces and
the state news agency Xinhua reported trace levels of
radioactivity detected in 22 provinces.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2011 10:44AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-What is the Icesave dispute all about?," April 7 (Reuters) - Icelanders will vote on Saturday on a
plan to repay around $5 billion to Britain and the Netherlands
to cover debts from the financial crisis, with popular backing
key to keeping an economic recovery on track.
 The debt was incurred in 2008 when an Icelandic bank that
offered savings accounts in Britain and the Netherlands under
the name Icesave collapsed.
 
 Following are some of the key facts on the dispute:
 A DEAL DELAYED:
 * Icelandic lawmakers backed a deal on Feb. 16 to repay the
$5 billion to Britain and the Netherlands for debts from the
banking crash, bringing the island closer to resolving a dispute
that has held back its recovery.
 * However Iceland's president triggered the new referendum
when he refused to sign the bill on Feb. 20 setting out the
terms of repayment that had been approved by parliament.
 * It was the second time he called a referendum on a bill on
the issue. Icelanders overwhelmingly rejected an earlier deal in
a March 2010 vote.
 * The government and economists say solving the Icesave
issue will help Iceland get back into financial markets to fund
itself, an important step towards lifting capital controls
imposed in 2008 to stabilise the crown currency.
 * A financial rescue programme, led by the International
Monetary Fund, runs out this year.
 * The EFTA Surveillance Authority, a European trade body
overseeing Iceland's cooperation with the European Union, warned
Iceland in May 2010 it should pay up or face possible court
proceedings.
 * Moody's said in February that Iceland's sovereign credit
rating could be downgraded if its voters reject the new plan to
repay the debts.
 * Iceland started EU accession talks last summer. Solving
the dispute is seen as an important step in attaining
membership.
 * With the Icesave issue solved, fishing rights will become
the main stumbling block to EU entry.
 
 HOW THE DEAL MAY WORK:
 * The draft deal has an estimated cost to Iceland of around
47 billion Icelandic crowns ($415 million). The bulk of the
repayment is expected to come from assets recovered from the
collapsed bank.
 * Iceland's negotiators and the winding-up committee of the
Landsbanki estate estimated they would recover at least 86
percent of the total $5.2 billion debt, the finance minister
said.
* The deal will be final once Iceland's parliament and
president approve.
 
 THE COLLAPSE:
 * Iceland's banks expanded aggressively overseas during the
global credit boom, taking their balance sheets to almost 11
times the island's annual economic output, and became an emblem
of the decade's excesses when the bubble burst.
 * All three of Iceland's top banks collapsed within days of
each other when global credit dried up in 2008, leaving them
unable to sustain their heavy debt burdens.
 * Iceland took over the banks' domestic operations and
compensated Icelandic savers for lost money, but savers in other
countries with Icelandic accounts were left out in the cold.
 * Around 400,000 saves in Britain and the Netherlands had
accounts with Icesave when it collapsed.
 * Britain and the Netherlands compensated individual savers
who lost money in full. Iceland agreed to pay this money back to
the two countries, but settling the terms has proved tough.
 
 DEBTS:
 * Iceland owes Britain a maximum of 2.35 billion pounds
($3.75 billion) and the Netherlands 1.2 billion euros ($1.7
billion) plus interest. The final amount depends on how much
money is recovered from the sale of assets owned by Landsbanki.
Iceland has said the assets may cover all or nearly all the
claims.

 By Omar Valdimarsson and Anna Ringstrom
 REYKJAVIK/STOCKHOLM, April 7 (Reuters) - Icelanders look set
to reject a deal to repay Britain and the Netherlands for debts
from a bank crash, denting government hopes to draw a line under
its financial crisis and speed economic recovery.
 A referendum will be held on Saturday on an agreement to
repay the $5 billion debt, run up after the British and Dutch
governments repaid depositors who had money in an online account
called Icesave. The account was run by one of the three
Icelandic banks which collapsed in late 2008.
 On Thursday, one poll showed 57 percent and another 55
percent against the new deal, which the government says is
better than one they rejected in March 2010. The readings came
after weeks of polls showing support for the deal.
 A ""no"" vote would be a blow for the centre-left coalition,
which managed Iceland out of the depths of its financial crisis
but it has not said it will resign if so.
 ""A 'no' vote is a recipe for uncertainty for at least the
next one to two years,"" Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir
said on Thursday. ""We would have to review and possibly revise
the current economic programme.""
 Many Icelanders say they are angry that taxpayers have to
bail out irresponsible banks.
 ""Last week I had settled on a yes but now I'm going to vote
against,"" said Bragi Baldvinsson, a 42-year-old aero-engineer.
 ""People here have lost massive amounts of money. That's
tough luck -- and tough luck also for the Icesave depositors in
Britain and the Netherlands.""
 Hjalti Gudmundsson, 45, said he planned to vote ""yes"".
 ""The overriding factor is the need to be on good terms with
our neighbours and the outside world. We should settle our
differences through negotiation, not through the courts.""
 If Icelanders turn down the new Icesave deal, the dispute
may instead be solved in a European court, a solution some
economists say would be much costlier.
 The referendum, in which 230,000 voters can take part,
begins at 0800 GMT and ends at 2200 GMT.
 
 ECONOMIC REHABILITATION
 The government and economists say solving the Icesave issue
will help Iceland get back into financial markets to fund itself
after a financial rescue programme, led by the International
Monetary Fund, runs out this year.
 It will also help the country of 320,000 people remove the
controls on capital flows it imposed to stop its currency from
falling further.
 The controls have left an estimated 465 billion crowns
($4.10 billion), equivalent to one-fourth of the island's
output, in foreign hands, some of which wants to escape.
 ""The protracted dispute over Icesave has complicated many
aspects of Iceland's recovery and economic rehabilitation,"" said
Paul Rawkins, an analyst at ratings agency Fitch.
 Foreign investment has been delayed for example, he said.
 A ""yes"" vote would show the world Iceland wants to normalise
relations with international creditors and could set the stage
for credit rating improvements, he said.
 ""If it remains a 'no', it could stall the resolution of
capital controls and leave Iceland where it's been for the last
18 months or so, which is sort of caught in a state of limbo.""
 Iceland last month outlined a cautious plan to gradually
relax the capital controls, a process expected to take years.
The main steps will only take place once Iceland has showed it
can refinance loans in foreign credit markets.

 By Sakari Suoninen
 FRANKFURT, April 7 (Reuters) - By declaring it is
""essential"" to avoid broad-based pressure for inflation and
raising its overnight deposit rate as well as its key refi rate,
the European Central Bank signalled it will act aggressively if
necessary this year to head off an extended rise of inflation.
 At his news conference after the ECB hiked the refinancing
rate by 25 basis points from a record-low level of 1.00 percent
on Thursday, President Jean-Claude Trichet had the opportunity
to dampen market expectations for more rate rises this year.
 He did say the ECB had not decided its hike would be the
first in a series -- an assurance to nervous markets that the
central bank would weigh each month's rate decision carefully.
But the Governing Council meeting was in any case very unlikely
to agree in advance on a string of hikes.
 By stressing the importance of avoiding an inflationary
spiral, saying the medium-term risks were for higher inflation,
and attributing inflation pressure to strong growth in emerging
economies as well as high oil prices, Trichet made clear where
the ECB's priorities will lie this year.
 ""We will continue to monitor very closely all developments
with respect to upside risks to price stability,"" he said. This
was slightly less hawkish in tone than Trichet's remark last
month that he would adopt ""strong vigilance"" against inflation,
which markets saw as indicating an imminent rate hike, but the
inclusion of the word ""very"" showed continued concern.
 So markets will continue to view Thursday's hike, the first
since July 2008, as the beginning of a series of rate rises
extending at last through the end of this year.
 Portugal's decision on Wednesday night to seek an
international bailout has probably made it easier for the ECB to
tighten policy in coming months, since the bailout will give
Lisbon relatively low-cost financing as market rates rise.
 Before Thursday's rate hike, EONIA overnight rates implied a
rise in the refi rate to 1.75 percent by the end of this year.
After the decision, they were barely changed .

 DEPOSIT RATE
 Also important was the ECB's decision on Thursday to raise
the overnight deposit rate, which acts as a floor for short-term
market rates, by 25 basis points to 0.50 percent.
 About half of economists surveyed by Reuters had expected
the ECB to leave the deposit rate at 0.25 percent, widening the
corridor between it and the refi rate back to its traditional,
pre-crisis size of 1 percentage point.
 The central bank's hike of the deposit rate suggests it is
not willing to sit back and wait for market rates to return to
normal levels above the refi rate as commercial banks gradually
reduce their intake of ECB loans. Instead, the ECB wants to
reassert some control over market rates and dictate the pace at
which they rebound from ultra-low levels.
 However, Trichet did not reveal when or how the ECB would
take a key step towards returning market rates to normal levels:
phasing out its offers of unlimited loans to banks in money
market operations. The loans were introduced as an emergency
step but have now become a liability, putting massive downward
pressure on rates.
 Last month, euro zone official sources told Reuters that the
ECB was close to creating a new liquidity facility that would
support weak banks in Ireland and elsewhere, helping it
eventually to phase out unlimited loans. 
 But disagreements within the ECB's Governing Council over
how much aid the central bank should provide to countries have
caused that plan to be suspended. The ECB may have to resolve
the dispute and put the new facility in place before it can say
anything explicit about ending unlimited loans.
 
 CURRENCY, GROWTH AND INFLATION
 The fact that Trichet did not express concern about the
strong euro, which has been hitting 14-month highs against the
dollar, was also striking.
 He said one of the upside risks for economic growth was
exports, implying he felt they could withstand euro strength,
and did not list currency appreciation as one of the downside
risks to economic expansion.
 Although $1.40 has been seen by some euro zone officials as
a pain level for manufacturers, the strong euro helps curb
commodity price inflation, which probably accounts for Trichet's
acceptance of currency levels. This suggests the euro might have
to rise considerably further, perhaps to $1.50, before the ECB
became concerned about it.
 Movements in other currencies, and the euro zone's
increasing dependence on trade with Asia rather than the United
States, may also reduce the impact on growth of euro
appreciation against the dollar. The euro has risen about 7
percent against the dollar this year but on a trade-weighted
basis , it is up a little over 3 percent.
 The lack of criticism by euro zone government officials and
politicians ahead of the ECB's rate decision, which was
telegraphed well in advance, suggests Trichet succeeded in
convincing them of the central bank's argument that it needs to
be seen to acting against inflation to avoid an upward spiral in
wages and prices.
 Euro zone inflation accelerated to 2.6 percent last month,
well above the ECB's medium-term target of just below 2.0
percent, and record oil prices mean upward pressure may persist.
An inflation-fuelled surge in bond market yields would hurt the
finances of governments around the region.
 From the point of view of growth, weak states -- Greece,
Ireland, Portugal and Spain -- would ideally face lower interest
rates, to ease pressure on their banks and mortgage holders.
 But a 25 bp interest rate hike in itself will have little
impact, especially since market rates already rose in
anticipation of Thursday's decision, meaning they may have
little room to climb further for now.
 Berenberg Bank estimated the annual impact on the Spanish
economy of a 0.5 percentage point rise in ECB rates at between
0.1 and 0.2 percentage point of gross domestic product.
 However, the ECB's series of rate hikes will become a
significant drag on the region's growth over time, especially if
the euro stays firm. In a report issued before the ECB decision,
Morgan Stanley raised its 2011 estimate for euro zone growth
this year from 1.5 percent to 1.7 percent.
 But predicting the refi rate would be hiked a total of 100
bps by next spring, it said tighter monetary policy and a strong
euro would cut next year's growth to 1.2 percent from the 1.7
percent which Morgan Stanley previously forecast.

 (Recasts, updates prices, adds quotes, changes dateline,

 NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Thursday after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the central bank did not decide if the
interest rate hike earlier in the day was the first in a
series..
 Though he later qualified his remarks by saying the bank
always does what they judge as necessary, it was not hawkish
enough for some investors who had been betting on at least two
further rate increases this year..
 Trichet was speaking at a press conference after the ECB
earlier raised rates for the first time since July 2008 by 25
basis points to 1.25 percent as expected.
The euro pared and extended losses in volatile trade as
Trichet began speaking, particularly as he said euro zone
monetary policy was still very accommodative though there were
upside inflation risks from energy prices.
 ""His tone is decidedly neutral right now. He's keeping
things very close to his vest,"" said Boris Schlossberg, head of
research at GFT Forex. ""I think the ECB has done what they
wanted with this rate hike and they don't want to raise
expectations for more right now.""
 The euro was down 0.5 percent on the day at $1.4255, off a
more than 14-month high of $1.4350 touched on Wednesday.
Options traders noted demand for short-term upside strikes in
the $1.4400 region, as market players looked to protect against
a further rise in the euro.
 Some say the euro could fall to as low as $1.4200. ""The
euro trade has been so focused on interest rate differentials,
so some of the fast money might come out of the trade,"" said
Schlossberg. 
 The single currency has risen more than 3 percent since
Trichet's comments on March 3 strongly hinted at a rate hike.
Against the yen, the euro fell one percent on the day,
hitting the day's low around 121.10 yen, with traders citing
real money selling of euros. It was last down at 121.27.
 SPANISH AUCTION
 The currency market was also cautious as Portugal moved to
seek a bailout from the European Union, with the size of the
package expected to be up to 80 billion euro ($114 billion).
 Fears Spain may be the next on the market's radar for its
debt problems eased somewhat after Madrid comfortably sold 4.1
billion euros of a new three-year bond.
 Expectations for higher euro zone rates contrasted with
uncertainty in the United States over when the Federal Reserve
may begin to tighten policy.
 Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Sandra Pianalto,
speaking in Rome, said on Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve
should keep its fed funds target rate very low for a long time
and complete its asset purchasing program as scheduled.
 This followed remarks the previous day from Atlanta Fed
President Dennis Lockhart, who, citing, the fragility of the
U.S. economy remains said it was too early for the Fed to
to begin raising rates.
 The Bank of England kept rates unchanged, as expected.
 Sterling slipped against the dollar after the decision as
some had positioned themselves for the slim chance of a rate
rise. Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.6285.
 The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as expected
and signaled its readiness to ease policy further, bucking a
global trend of central banks withdrawing excess liquidity put
in place during the financial crisis.
 The dollar rose to a six-month high of 85.54 yen in Asia,
almost 10 yen above its record low of 76.25 yen hit in March,
days after Japan's devastating earthquake. It fell back to last
trade around 85.12 yen, down 0.4 percent.
 The Australian dollar scaled a fresh post-float high
against the greenback of $1.0505. The Australian dollar was
floated in December 1983. It was aided by data showing the
Australian economy added a higher-than-expected 37,800 jobs in
March.

 * Move may lead SNB to tighten earlier than expected
 * Futures price in SNB move in Sept, slight chance in June
 
 By Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, April 7 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's
interest rate rise on Thursday opens the way for the Swiss
National Bank to tighten too -- possibly as early as June -- by
taking some pressure off the red-hot franc.
 Despite the economy's strong rebound from the crisis, robust
consumer spending and a booming real estate market, the SNB has
held off raising its target for the three-month Swiss franc
LIBOR -- which has been at 0.25 percent since March 2009.
 But the ECB's rate rise -- its first since July 2008 --
gives the SNB more leeway as it lessens pressure on the
safe-haven franc, which soared 15 percent last year to a record
against the euro during the euro zone debt crisis.
 The Swiss franc slipped slightly against the euro after the
ECB decision but rose again after ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet said the hike was not necessarily the first in a series.
 Swiss interest rate futures were flat, fully pricing in a
hike in September with a slight chance of a June move. While
the franc hit a new all-time high of 0.8963 per dollar in the
wake of Japan's earthquake last month, it has fallen more than 5
percent against the euro from a record high hit on Dec. 30. The
euro zone is Switzerland's biggest trading partner.
 ""It will be interesting to see whether the ECB will hint at
another rate hike before the summer break. Any such outcome
would further increase the pressure on the SNB to act,"" said UBS
economist Reto Huenerwadel, who sees the SNB hiking in June.
 ""They have to be careful about signalling tightening
expectations at an early stage as this could have an impact have
on the franc,"" he said.
 ""Consequently, they will wait to announce something and
carefully look at the next inflation numbers, growth and jobs.""
 The franc jumped on Wednesday after data showed Swiss
inflation rose more than expected in March.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the SNB
should be in a position to tighten in the near-term, barring any
more shocks.
 In a newspaper interview, SNB board member Jean-Pierre
Danthine said monetary policy was appropriate for the economy as
a whole, but the SNB would hike rates if it were to look solely
at the buoyant real estate market or the domestic economy.

 He also said an ECB rate rise would make the SNB's job
easier by taking the pressure off the franc.
 SNB vice-chairman Thomas Jordan said last month the franc's
rise was tightening monetary conditions and limiting the central
bank's room for manoeuvre.
 The SNB's next monetary policy meeting is in June. It kept
interest rates ultra-low at its March quarterly monetary policy
meeting, citing risks from Europe's debt crisis and the Japan
disaster. But the central bank dropped any reference to
deflation risks and raised its growth and inflation forecasts.

plant
 * Eyes trade links with drugs firm and aluminium smelter
 
 By Maja Zuvela
 SARAJEVO, April 7 (Reuters) - Mitsui & Co, Japan's
second-biggest trading house, could invest up to 200 million
euros ($286 million) in Bosnia's energy sector and is also
eyeing opportunities in aluminium and drugs, top officials said.
 Shunsuke Nakagawara, the general manager of Mitsui & Co
business development centre for Eastern Europe and Russia, said
the group is interested in Bosnia's wind, solar and hydro-power
resources and would soon start talks on new projects.
 ""Bosnia has a lot hydro-power potential and for the start we
are interested to invest up to 200 million euros into a new
hydro-power station here,"" he said on the sidelines of a
business conference.
 ""If there are other good business opportunities, we are
ready to invest more,"" Nakagawara added.
 Bosnia gets 40 percent of its electricity from hydro-power
plants and the remainder from coal-fired plants. Unlike other
countries in the region, which rely on imports to cover much of
their consumption, it is able to export power, helped by its
hydro potential.
 Governments of its two autonomous regions, the Muslim-Croat
federation and the Serb Republic, aim to attract some 16 billion
Bosnian marka ($11.7 billion) of investments into the energy
sector over a decade to boost output and meet growing demand.
 The plans include overhaul of units at communist-era
coal-fired plants and building of new, more environment-friendly
units, as well as the construction of a series of new hydro
power plants and wind parks.
 
 DRUGS, ALUMINIUM
 Nakagawara said that Mitsui & Co was also exploring business
cooperation with Bosnia's top drugs firm Bosnalijek.
 ""Bosnalijek is a unique company because of its trade links
with South African and also Middle East markets,"" he said.
 Mitsui Chemicals is planning an expansion to new markets,
said Nakagawara. ""So, maybe we have some business chance with
Bosnalijek to help our Japanese branch channel the
products to Middle East and South Africa"".
 Rikukawa Takao, the general manager of Mitsui & Co Budapest
office, told Reuters the company also wants to establish trade
links with Bosnia's sole aluminium smelter Aluminij Mostar, the
top exporter, with much of its output destined for construction
and car industries in the European Union.
 ""We are mainly interested in trade cooperation but also we
want to study the company and examine what is the energy cost in
its aluminium production,"" he said.
 ""We would first set up trade links to get to know each other
better,"" Takao added.
 The federation government annulled a tender for the sale of
a majority stake in Aluminij last year after the top bidder, the
Swiss-based commodities trader Glencore International AG, had
set cheap power supplies as a condition which the government was
unwilling to meet.
 Aluminij has often complained over high power prices and
urged the government to help it get cheaper electricity arguing
that power prices account for 60 percent of the cost to produce
one tonne of metal.
 The smelter located in the southern town of Mostar expects
to produce a record 128,500 tonnes of primary aluminium this
year, helped by better demand and a return to full capacity in
late 2010.

 (Adds analyst, shipping comment, details, background)
 By Amena Bakr and Jonathan Saul
 DUBAI/LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - China will buy the first
oil cargo from Libyan rebels via trading house Vitol, sources
said on Thursday, in a trial deal which is likely to clear the
way for Europe to resume badly-needed purchases of Libyan oil.
 Traders, however, added that it could take a long time
before flows of crude from Libya reach substantial levels. The
war has cut oil output by 80 percent while rebels and government
forces trade charges over attacks on oil fields
 ""Given that several governments, including some in Europe
that now recognise it as the legal government of the country,
there would be no legal obstacle to buying oil from it or even
paying it directly,"" said J. Peter Pham, Africa director with
U.S. think tank the Atlantic Council.
 ""This is especially convenient for countries like France and
Italy,"" he said, adding the two countries normally get 15 and 20
percent respectively of their oil imports from Libya.
 Trading sources told Reuters earlier on Thursday that the
Liberia-registered tanker Equator, which can carry up to one
million barrels of oil, was taking Libyan crude to China.
 ""The delivery will be made in China, but it's still not
clear who the buyer is,"" said a Gulf-based trader. Other trade
sources said Vitol had been involved in the deal. The trading
house declined to comment.
 AIS live ship tracking data on Reuters showed the tanker
moving into the Mediterranean away from Libya's eastern ports of
Marsa el Hariga and Tobruk, where it loaded oil on Wednesday.
 An official with the vessel's Greek operators, Dynacom
Tankers Management Ltd, declined to comment.
 The tanker is expected to take around 28 days to arrive in
China including transit times through the Suez Canal and Red
Sea, a shipping source said.
 ""China has lifted oil from Libya before on a regular basis,""
the source said.
 The expected shipment will be the first in weeks since an
uprising against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi halted exports.
 ""If the first shipment makes it to China and there are no
problems with the transfer of payments, we should be expecting
to see more trade by the rebels who are being backed by Qatar,""
one Gulf-based trader said.
 Officials from Qatar's oil ministry denied that the Gulf
state is involved in the transfer or marketing of this shipment.
 ""As far as I'm aware, Qatar has not been involved in this
deal,"" said an official, declining to be named. 
 
 FURTHER SHIPMENTS
 The rebel-led government said it had concluded a deal with
Qatar to market crude oil and had discussed plans with a U.N.
envoy to exempt its oil exports from sanctions that have been
imposed on Libya. 
 Traders said they believed that the payments will be made

 ""The value of this first shipment is around $112 million and
will be made in a bank account outside of Libya that the rebels
would have access to,"" one of the traders said.
 Rebels have asked the United Nations to help restart oil and
gas exports from ports they control and said the matter required
""urgent attention"" to enable Libya's economy to function.

 Production at rebel-held oilfields in eastern Libya has
stopped after they came under attack from forces loyal to
Gaddafi, a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday.
 ""This is certainly not the last cargo from opponents of
Gaddafi,"" said John Dalby, chief executive with maritime risk
management specialists MRM.
 ""Libya's importance as an oil producer is being deliberately
underplayed given her reserves and China will buy Libyan oil and
establish its political and economic clout.""

 * Euro off 14-mth high vs dlr, 11-mth peak vs yen
 * Euro vulnerable to paring back of future rate rise chances

(Adds reaction to ECB decision, quote)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro was steady on Thursday
after the European Central Bank raised rates for the first time
since July 2008, but was off its multi-month peaks with
investors edgy that expectations for more tightening this year
could be dampened.
 The ECB raised its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 1.25
percent, as expected, with some having the view the euro may
weaken if President Jean-Claude Trichet, at a news conference at
1230 GMT, does not sound hawkish enough to keep alive
expectations for another two rate hikes by year-end.
 Some say the euro could fall to as low as $1.4200 with all
eyes on the tone of Trichet's introductory statement at the news
conference. That assumes significance after last month's
reference to ""strong vigilance"" regarding price pressures was
widely interpreted as signalling a rate hike was imminent.
 The single currency has risen more than 3 percent since
Trichet's comments on March 3. He will need to make reference to
""close monitoring"" of price pressures in his remarks on Thursday
to signal further rate rises are likely later in the year.
 ""The key will be Trichet's tone in the subsequent conference
and any extension of his hawkish rhetoric from the March meeting
should keep the euro supported,"" said Chris Walker, strategist
at UBS.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent on the day at $1.4280 ,
unchanged after the ECB rate decision, but off a 14-month high
of $1.4350 hit in on Wednesday. Options traders noted demand for
short-term upside strikes in the $1.4400 region, as market
players looked to protect against a further rise in the euro.
 Against the yen, the euro fell one percent on the day
, hitting day's low around 121.24 yen, with traders
citing real money selling of euros. It was last down at 121.58.
 ""The market is fully expecting Trichet to remain (hawkish)
so one would surmise the risk is for a correction lower in the
euro,"" said one trader, who reported strong interest to sell the
euro against the dollar at $1.4350 and versus the yen in the
122.50 area.
 Lutz Karpowitz, currency analyst at Commerzbank said there
was a risk euro bulls could be disappointed by any neutral
comments from Trichet. ""I would rather bet on the downside,
$1.4200 can easily be reached,"" he said.

 * Markets split on chance of May hike, Q1 GDP seen pivotal
 * ECB rate hike may fuel criticism BoE too soft on inflation
 
 By Christina Fincher and David Milliken
 LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - The Bank of England held
interest rates at a record-low 0.5 percent on Thursday, opting
to wait for clearer signs of recovery before following the
European Central Bank in tightening policy.
 Although inflation in Britain is almost twice as high as in
the euro zone -- it hit 4.4 percent in February -- Britain's
recovery is more shaky than that of France or Germany and the
economy unexpectedly lurched into reverse at the end of 2010.
 The on-hold verdict will come as relief to the government,
which is hoping monetary policy will stay loose to cushion the
blow of its fiscal tightening, but may fuel criticism that the
BoE has gone soft on inflation.
 Finance minister George Osborne said again on Thursday that
Britain risked a debt crisis like that of Greece, Ireland and
Portugal if it failed to cut a record peacetime budget deficit.

 The BoE may not keep its powder dry for long, however.
Markets are split roughly 50:50 on the chance of a rate hike in
May and have fully discounted a quarter-point rise by August.

 Three of the BoE's nine policymakers are already convinced
of the need to raise rates and a robust first quarter GDP
estimate, due on April 27, could bring the majority on board.
 ""News since the March meeting has generally supported the
view that the acute weakness in Q4 was a 'one-off' but has not
been conclusive in this regard,"" said Nomura economist Philip
Rush.
 ""Pivotal members of the Monetary Policy Committee have
indicated they are awaiting confirmation of this before voting
in favour of a rate hike.""
 
 CREDIBILITY QUESTION
 Undeterred by the BoE's reticence, the ECB raised interest
rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent, its first increase
since July 2008, signalling a growing worry that price pressures
are becoming entrenched.
 Given the ECB is dealing with a smaller inflation problem,
the move is bound to heighten accusations that Britain's central
bank is falling behind the curve. 
 But the ECB's move is unlikely to worry the BoE, which is
keen to engineer an export-led recovery and may welcome the
pound's export competitiveness against the euro, the currency of
Britain's main European trading partners.
 Anticipation of the ECB's rate rise this week has seen the
euro gain 5 percent against the pound since mid February. At the
same time, the pound has risen slightly against the dollar,
helping buffer the pain of rising oil and commodity prices.
 ""The negative impact of the ECB's rate rise on demand in a
key export market will be balanced for the BoE by the effect of
a more competitive currency,"" said George Buckley, chief UK
economist at Deutsche Bank.
 Minutes of the BoE's meeting this week will be published on
April 20, giving the vote breakdown for Thursday's decision and
policymakers' reasoning.
 At last month's rate-setting meeting, BoE policymakers
viewed the rise in oil prices as having increased the risks to
growth as well as the risks to inflation.
 The BoE's focus on downside risks to consumption contrasts
with the ECB which is more worried that inflation will trigger
'second round' effects -- possibly because wages in some euro
zone countries are directly indexed to prices, unlike in
Britain.
 ""Although high and rising inflation is clearly a problem for
the Bank of England, there are plenty of reasons to err on the
side of caution,"" said Hetal Mehta, an economist at Daiwa.
 ""With economic growth set to remain subdued, unemployment
likely to rise further, continued weakness in credit growth, and
stringent fiscal consolidation yet to bite, the majority on the
Monetary Policy Committee will be in no hurry to tighten
policy.""

 By Elisabeth O'Leary
 MADRID, April 7 (Reuters) - Spain vowed on Thursday it would
not follow ailing neighbour Portugal in seeking a European
bailout, and a successful Spanish bond auction suggested markets
do not immediately fear contagion.
 The fall of another euro zone domino following Greece and
Ireland focused attention on Madrid, testing the efforts that
its government, and European authorities, have poured into
erecting a firewall to buttress its public finances.
 ""(The risk of contagion) is absolutely ruled out ... it has
been some time since the markets have known that our economy is
much more competitive,"" Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado
told national radio station SER.
 News that Greece has fallen behind on its deficit reduction
target, and rising expectations that Athens will have to
restructure its debt, showed that the single currency area has
yet to fully resolve the sovereign debt and banking crisis.
 Caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates announced on
Wednesday that Portugal was asking for financial assistance from
the European Union, saying the economic risks had become too
great to go it alone after borrowing rates soared.
 While European Union officials voiced relief, non-euro zone
Sweden criticised Lisbon for waiting too long.
 ""They should have requested aid much earlier,"" Swedish
Finance Minister Anders Borg told journalists. ""They have placed
themselves and Europe in a very difficult situation.""
 Portugal said it would submit a formal request on Thursday.
A senior euro zone source said Lisbon would have to make clear
if its caretaker government has the authority to negotiate a
bailout before a June 5 general election.
 EU officials said a deal would probably be agreed before a
new government is elected, signalling Brussels was keen to avoid
it being enmeshed in electioneering if possible. But the
campaign may nevertheless complicate talks on austerity measures
required to secure EU/IMF rescue loans.
 The main centre-right opposition Social Democrats said they
supported the minority Socialist government's application, but
both big parties are seeking to score points by blaming each
other for the humiliating resort to aid.
 
 SMOOTH AUCTION
 The head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, an intergovernmental policy think-tank, said Spain
would not face the same problems as Portugal because it was
addressing key challenges.
 ""Spain has addressed the four things that had to be
addressed: the deficit, the labour markets, the pensions and the
financial system,"" the OECD's Angel Gurria said in Budapest.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
confirmed that the ECB, which has been buying Portuguese bonds
and propping up its banks with liquidity, had pressed Lisbon to
seek assistance.
 Speaking after the ECB raised interest rates for the first
time since before the global financial crisis in July 2008,
Trichet said Spain had already done a lot, but needed to
continue. The executive European Commission also said Spain was
on track to fulfil its deficit reduction targets.
 By contrast, a source close to Greece's international
lenders told Reuters that Athens' 2010 budget deficit would be
revised to above 10 percent of gross domestic product, requiring
corrective measures to stem spillover effects.
 EU paymaster Germany's leading economic institutes said they
expect Greece's sovereign debt will be restructured -- a view
shared by a majority of Greeks, according to an opinion poll
released on Thursday.
 That could cast Greece into a deeper economic depression and
cause problems for convalescent European banks, notably in
Germany and France, the two main foreign holders of Greek public
debt. Diplomats say this is one reason why euro zone governments
and the ECB are anxious to delay any such move until after 2013.
 The long-anticipated Portuguese call for help turned the
spotlight back on Spain and its weakened finances, but the
Treasury easily sold 4.1 billion euros of 3-year bonds on
Thursday without yields spiking up.
 ""The auction confirms that investors separate Portugal from
Spain,"" said Estefania Ponte, economist at Cortal Consor in
Madrid.
 The risk premium on Spanish 10-year bonds compared with the
German benchmark rose fractionally to 181 basis points on
Thursday but remained close to a two-month low.
 Spanish 10-year yields are around 5.2 percent compared with
the 6.1 percent Portugal was paying shortly after Ireland was
rescued last November. Benchmark German 10-year yields have
risen by around 50 basis points since then.
 Whether Spanish rates fall further is likely to depend on
investors keeping faith with Madrid's drive to cut its deficit
aggressively and revive an almost-stagnant economy struggling
with high unemployment.
 The next expected step is a reform of collective bargaining,
loosening the link between inflation and wages, expected in
mid-April after the government gave unions and employers longer
to reach an agreement.
 
 SPAIN SHIELDED?
 Spain had about 25 billion euros ($34 billion) in foreign
direct investment in Portugal in 2009, the last available
figures, and Spanish banks have $98.3 billion in total exposure
to their neighbour, around a third of its foreign-owned debt.
 Analysts say Madrid is shielded as long as a rescue package
comes through for Lisbon, but some 8.5 percent of Spain's
exports go to Portugal, so the budget austerity that accompanies
a bailout is likely to have a knock-on effect.
 ""Portugal's bailout request puts the likes of Spain under
the spotlight, but we are of the opinion that Spain will not
follow due to its improving fiscal situation and recovering
economy, while also passing key structural reforms in the labour
market and pensions,"" Credit Agricole analysts said in a note.
 Spain dragged itself out of an 18-month recession at the
start of last year but growth has stuttered since then and the
central bank and many economists doubt the economy can grow as
much as the government expects.
 Official forecasts for growth in 2012 and 2013 were cut to
2.3 percent and 2.4 percent respectively due to the likely
impact of higher interest rates and oil prices.
 But Salgado argued that a widely-expected quarter point
interest rate rise by the European Central Bank on Thursday
would not endanger an economy already dealing with public
spending cutbacks and labour market reforms.
 ""The impact of a small rise in rates is very slow. Mortgages
(in Spain) are only revised once a year and so the transmission
(of a rate rise) is not immediate,"" she said.
 Spanish banks are seen as among the most vulnerable in
Europe to a series of ECB rate hikes. Although one round of
higher rates will not cause problems, further hikes will squeeze
profit at banks and push already-stretched borrowers into
arrears, analysts said

 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, April 7 (Reuters) - World trade will carry the scars
of the financial crisis into 2012, the World Trade Organization
said on Thursday with a prediction of 6.5 percent growth for
this year, less than half of last year's sharp rebound.
 The forecast, for growth in trade of goods as measured by
export volume, is above the 6 percent average for 1990 to 2008.
 The driver will in large part be strong developing
economies, especially China.
 But for worldwide commerce to get back on the growth track
seen before a credit crunch and bank failures tipped trade into
a 12 percent decline for 2009, growth would need to be an
unlikely 19 percent this year, according to WTO statistics.
 ""The hangover from the financial crisis is still with us,""
said WTO Director General Pascal Lamy.
 Developing country trade is projected to grow by 9.5 percent
in 2011, while that of developed countries is set to grow only
4.5 percent, the WTO said.
 The organisation, whose forecasts are limited to
merchandise, or goods, and do not attempt to predict trends in
services such as banking, also revised up its estimate of trade
growth in 2010 to 14.5 percent from 13.5 percent.
 It said activity had recovered more strongly in developed
countries than previously thought.
 The Japanese earthquake and nuclear accident have been
factored into the prediction, but these disasters, together with
volatile commodity prices and turmoil in the Arab world, make
predictions particularly uncertain this year and the risk is to
the downside, it said.
 China's move up the trade rankings continued after the
country became the world's top exporter of goods in 2009. The
WTO data ranked it as top goods exporter again in 2010 with a 10
percent share, while in commercial services it moved up both the
export and import ranks to become fourth and third respectively.
 The WTO added a best and worst case scenario to its 6.5
percent forecast, with the best at 10.5 percent and the worst at
2 percent. The central 6.5 percent prediction contrasts with the
10 percent growth forecast by CPB Netherlands Bureau for
Economic Policy and Analysis.
 The WTO's projections for this year are based on expected
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3.1 percent in 2011, at
market exchange rates, reflecting a consensus of predictions.
The WTO does not produce its own GDP forecasts.

 DOHA GLOOM
 Lamy presented the figures as evidence of ""how trade has
helped the world escape recession in 2010"" and warned of the
dangers of setting trade barriers such as tariffs and subsidies.
 ""High unemployment in developed economies and sharp
belt-tightening in Europe will keep fuelling protectionist
pressures,"" he said.
 Lamy is under pressure because the so-called Doha round of
WTO trade negotiations aimed at keeping tariffs, subsidies and
other barriers to trade at bay is widely seen as in crisis.
 The talks are almost a decade old and have stalled. Failure
to secure an agreement this year could leave the talks in limbo
as a number of key WTO members enter election years in 2012.
 Economists agree that the WTO's work is important to keeping
trade turning over.
 ""This is a matter for the long run,"" said Gerard van
Welzenis of the semi-independent Dutch government body CPB.
 ""Even during the (financial) crisis (of 2008-2009) we might
have expected governments to raise barriers, but not much
happened,"" he said, attributing that success in part to the
WTO's existence. ""It's still important.""

interest rates at a record-low 0.5 percent on Thursday despite a
surge in inflation, ceding the limelight to the European Central
Bank, which was expected to raise borrowing costs less than an
hour later.
 A majority of BoE policy makers continue to judge the
economic recovery too shaky to withstand higher rates, betting
that inflation of 4.4 percent -- more than double the target --
will ease once oil and food prices come down.
 Meanwhile the ECB, dealing with a much smaller inflation
problem, has left little doubt that a first post-crisis rate

 The Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee
said last month that a rise in oil prices, fanned by tension in
the Middle East and North Africa, had increased risks to both
inflation and growth.
 So far there is little evidence that Britain's economy has
enjoyed a strong rebound from the shock contraction at the end

 The survey, conducted on March 3-9 among 950 Poles, showed
the number of people either ""strongly"" or ""tending to be"" in
favour of swapping zlotys for euros had dropped by nine
percentage points from a year ago.
 The total opposed to the euro has now reached 60 percent, up

 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist, pro-EU
government had originally set 2012 as its target date for
joining the euro but the global financial crisis and then the
debt crisis in the euro zone itself scuppered those plans.
 Poland does not currently meet all the criteria for euro
membership, especially with a budget deficit of around eight
percent of gross domestic product, more than twice the European
Union's 3 percent ceiling.
 Tusk's government says the 17-nation euro zone needs to
resolve its sovereign debt crises before adding new members.
 Euro membership remains an official strategic goal for the
Tusk government but some Poles have cooled to the idea as the
sharp fall in the free-floating zloty during the global
financial crisis helped Poland escape recession.
 Poland is by far the largest of the ex-communist economies
that have joined the European Union since 2004.

 * Asset purchase program should be completed as planned
 * Repeats call for explicit 2 pct inflation target
 
 (Adds comment, combines stories)
 By Gavin Jones
 ROME, April 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should
keep its fed funds target rate very low for a long time and
complete its asset purchasing program as scheduled, Cleveland
Federal Reserve Bank President Sandra Pianalto said on Thursday.
 In a speech in Rome, Pianalto said she saw no evidence that
sharp rises in food and energy prices would lead to lasting
inflation, though the Fed is ""watching carefully"" for any signs
of an unanticipated spillover.
 ""My outlook for economic growth and inflation assumes that
we complete our asset purchase program as originally scheduled,
and keep our federal funds rate target at exceptionally low
levels for an extended period,"" Pianalto said.
 The Fed's current $600 billion asset purchase program is
scheduled to end in June.
 ""I don't expect recent rises in food and energy prices to
cause a broad spillover into a wide array of consumer prices, or
in other words a lasting increase in inflation,"" said Pianalto,
who is not a voter on the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open
Market Committee this year.
 ""Specifically, I expect the underlying trend in broad
consumer prices to rise only gradually toward 2 percent by
2013.""
 Pianalto said inflation would likely be kept in check by
slow wage growth, strong competition and soft business
conditions for retailers, and the continuation of low inflation
expectations as measured by bond yields and surveys of economic
forecasters.
 Pianalto, considered a centrist whose views tend to align
with those of Chairman Ben Bernanke, noted that measures of
longer-run inflation expectations remain below 2 percent.
 The Fed would ""eventually"" have to raise its fed funds
target rate and sell the assets in its portfolio, she said, but
she made clear she did not believe this should happen in the
near term.
 ""We have a lot of ground to make up in terms of employment
loss and output loss,"" she said in a panel discussion after her
speech. She noted that the economy has added back only 1.5
million of the 9 million lost jobs.
 She declined to comment on the fact that some voting members
on the Fed's Open Market Committee have suggested that policy
may need to be tightened before the end of this year.
 U.S. consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in February, the
largest increase since June 2009, driven by higher food and
energy prices, but underlying inflation pressures remained
contained.
 In the 12 months to February, inflation accelerated to 2.1
percent from 1.6 percent in January.
 Pianalto also repeated a call she made last month for the
Fed to adopt and publicly announce an explicit inflation
objective of 2 percent over the medium term.
 However, some officials have worried that establishing an
explicit target would limit the central bank's flexibility. In
2009, the Fed began providing a long-run inflation forecast that
is viewed as an informal target.
 Pianalto noted that economic recovery in the United States
was gathering strength, led by strong growth in exports and
manufacturing, though unemployment continues to be ""a
significant problem"".
 She said she expected the economy to continue to expand at a
moderate rate, ""a bit above its long-term average growth rate of
3 percent per year.""

 * Russia's Gazprom woos Ukraine with a $8 bln gas discount
 * Russian PM Putin to visit Kiev April 12
 
 KIEV, April 7 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovich made clear on Thursday the former Soviet republic did
not want to join a Russia-led customs union, suggesting a free
trade deal with it instead.
 Moscow has long urged Kiev to join the union whose other
members, Belarus and Kazakhstan, agreed last year to bring their
foreign trade policy in line with that of Russia and open up
their markets to Russian goods.
 But for Ukraine such a deal would rule out signing a free
trade agreement with the European Union, an essential step
towards deeper European integration.
 In his annual address to parliament, a few days before a
visit by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Yanukovich said
Ukraine would rather stay out of the customs union.
 ""I think the further development of our ties with the
customs union will be based on new agreements -- a free trade
agreement and a possible agreement on cooperation under a '3+1'
scheme,"" Yanukovich said.
 He said Ukraine wanted to finalise the free trade deal with
the EU this year, a move that would make joining the ex-Soviet
trading bloc impossible. Putin visits Ukraine on April 12.
 Just as Yanukovich was deliverng his speech, Russia's
Gazprom said it would give Ukraine a large discount on gas
supplies if it joined the customs union, allowing Kiev to save
$8 billion a year.
 Ukraine, which depends heavily on Russian gas, has long
asked Moscow to cut the price but refused to meet earlier
conditions for a discount, such as merging its state energy firm
Naftogaz with Gazprom.

 * Conservative whip predicts broad German support
 * Sometimes eurosceptic Merkel allies say in favour

(Adds Irish, Spanish and Dutch comments)
 By Stephen Brown and Andreas Rinke
 BERLIN, April 7 (Reuters) - Germany threw its weight behind
Portugal's request for financial help from the European Union on
Thursday with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their
sometimes eurosceptic allies looking likely to back such a deal.
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, mindful of the concerns
among taxpayers in affluent Germany already bearing the brunt of
existing bailouts for Greece and Ireland, pointed out that such
aid could only be granted in return for tough reforms.
 Calling it a ""sensible and necessary step"", Schaeuble said
in a statement that within the current bailout mechanism, aid
was only available in return for ""an adjustment programme"".
 But crucially the first signals from members of Merkel's
coalition were positive for Lisbon, including from her junior
partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), who sometimes talk tough on
bailouts to shore up their flagging popularity at home.
 Senior FDP figures including Volker Wissing, who heads the
German parliament's finance committee, welcomed Portugal taking
a step that has long been widely considered inevitable.
 ""We're relieved that Portugal is now seeking aid and thus
sending a signal that will calm markets,"" said Wissing.
 Portugal's aid request was closely watched across Europe,
especially in countries that have either already sought help --
Greece and Ireland -- or see it as a risk, such as Spain.
 Irish Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore told parliament in
Dublin that Portugal's situation ""underlines the extent to which
the problem has a European dimension"".
 In Spain's El Pais daily, an editorial headlined ""the final
rescue"" hoped Portugal's rescue would draw a line under the euro
crisis. The business daily Expansion said Portugal's inability
to grow economically was similar to that of Spain.
 
 LIVING BEYOND MEANS?
 Dire warnings about the euro zone turning into a so-called
""transfer union"", where Germany with its vibrant economy and
deep pockets has to fund the debts of spendthrift peripheral
European states, get a receptive audience in Germany.
 Hans-Werner Sinn, head of the influential Ifo economic
think-tank, was quoted in the top-selling daily Bild warning:
""The more money flows, the longer the indebted countries are
going to live beyond their means, the more money is lost.""
 However, Werner Hoyer, Germany's FDP deputy foreign
minister, told Reuters Portugal's decision had averted a ""very
dangerous"" threat for the country and the euro zone, saying
market reactions showed there was ""no risk of a chain reaction"".
 Such comments backed the view of Merkel's parliamentary
leader Peter Altmaier that bailing out Portugal was ""the best
solution in the circumstances"" and should get ""unanimous and
cross-party support in parliament"".
 ""We have in the course of the past year made clear under
what conditions this help will be offered, meaning that when you
get help you must in return sort out your finances, save, and
rebuild your competitiveness,"" Altmaier told Reuters.
 ""These are always tough decisions but they are unavoidable
because we want to ensure this aid makes it possible to have a
sustainable Portuguese economic recovery.""
 The Dutch government, closely aligned with Germany on euro
matters, also stressed that any Portuguese aid would ""come under
the strict rules of the IMF and the European emergency fund"",
Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager told ANP news agency.
 Merkel's whip Altmaier, asked about the eurosceptic comments
of some FDP leaders on bailouts, said the strict terms agreed
for the existing European Financial Stability Facility and the
European Stability Mechanism that succeeds it in 2013 meant that
""in the end, the coalition will act in a united fashion"".
 ""The CDU/CSU and FDP have always been Germany's pro-European
parties for the last 60 years,"" Altmaier said in an interview.
 But with the FDP in turmoil after Foreign Minister Guido
Westerwelle quit as party leader, some conservatives wonder
whether his 38-year-old successor, Health Minister Philipp
Roesler, has the power to keep the rest of the party in line.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Thursday
on hopes that Portugal's decision to seek financial aid could
put a brake on the region's debt crisis and as the European
Central Bank raised interest rates.
 Wall Street looked set to open flat to slightly higher.
 The ECB, as expected, raised rates by 25 basis points to
1.25 percent, wary of gathering inflation but confident that
growth could take it despite the ongoing euro zone debt crisis.
 It was the first rise since July 2008 and came a day after
Portugal's caretaker government requested European Union aid at
the urging of leading bankers, who wanted a bailout to help the
economy and safeguard the country's banking system.
 The pan-European European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index was
up 0.2 percent.
 Further contagion in the debt crisis was not being ruled
out, but other countries that have been struggling, notably
Spain, are less likely to be drawn in.
 ""We all knew Portugal was going that way, Spain looks like
it is in a better position,"" said Will Hedden, sales trader at
IG Index,
 But he added: ""It is a bit early to say everything stops
with Portugal.""
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were weak with emerging
markets stepping back from a sharp rally of the past few weeks
to fall more than a quarter of a percent.
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.07 percent, mainly due to
short-covering in energy and domestic-demand stocks.
 
 ECB AHEAD
 The euro fell from an 11-month high against the yen and a
14-month peak versus the dollar ahead of the well-flagged move,
partly on concerns that the ECB may not strongly signal a series
of future hikes.
 ""The euro has rallied considerably on the ECB rate hike view
but it may be the case of buy on the rumour, sell on the fact,""
said Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse,
explaining the day's moves.
 The euro was at $1.4284 and 121.61 yen after the decision.
 German government bond prices were lower on the day as were
Portuguese 10-year bonds.

 LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped from
multi-month highs on Thursday with the market fearful of a
scaling back of expectations for more euro zone interest rate
rises this year, ahead of a widely expected tightening at 1145
GMT.
 The ECB is still set to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis
points for the first time since July 2008. Portugal's request
for a European bailout has not changed the view the ECB would
follow up with more interest rate hikes, but many believe the
euro has risen too fast too far and is overdue a correction.
 Portugal became the third euro zone member to seek a bailout
from the European Union, with the size of the package expected
to be up to 80 billion euro ($114 billion).
 Analysts say ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet must sound
hawkish enough to keep alive expectations for another two rate
hikes by year-end for the euro to hold recent strong gains.
 The tone of Trichet's introductory statement is likely to be
crucial after last month's reference to ""strong vigilance""
regarding price pressures was widely interpreted as signalling a
rate hike was imminent. The single currency has risen over 3
percent since Trichet's comments on March 3.
 Trichet will need to make reference to ""close monitoring"" of
price pressures today to signal further rate rises are likely
later in the year.
 ""The market is generally expecting Trichet to refer to
""close monitoring"" which would probably be the signal for the
next hike in June. This would be net neutral for the euro,"" said
Stephen Gallo, Head of Market Analysis at Schneider Foreign
Exchange.
 Gallo said the market would also focus on a Spanish auction
of around 3.5 billion euros of a new three-year benchmark bond
on Thursday, adding there was a risk that with Portugal's
bailout under way, markets would focus more heavily on Spain's
debt problems.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent on the day at $1.4284, having
risen to $1.4350 on Wednesday, its highest since late January
2010. Traders said option-related supply was widespread into the
$1.4400 area, protecting barriers expiring in the next few
weeks.
 A major Asian sovereign account was reportedly also keen to
sell euros in the $1.4320 region.
 ""The market is fully expecting Trichet to remain (hawkish)
so one would surmise the risk is for a correction lower in the
euro,"" said a London-based trader, who reported strong interest
to sell the euro against the dollar at $1.4350 and versus the
yen in the 122.50 area.
 
 DOLLAR RISES
 The expectation for higher euro zone rates contrasted with
uncertainty in the United States over when the Federal Reserve
may begin to tighten policy. The U.S. economy remains too
fragile for the Fed to begin raising rates, Atlanta Fed
President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday. 
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 75.706 against a basket of
currencies.
 The yen held above a six-month trough against the dollar.
The Bank of Japan met market expectations that it would keep
monetary policy steady and signal its readiness to ease policy
further, bucking a global trend of central banks withdrawing
excess liquidity put in place during the financial crisis.
 The dollar had risen as high as 85.54, almost 10 yen above
its record low of 76.25 yen hit in March, days after northeast
Japan's devastating earthquake. It slipped back to trade around
85.22 in European dealing.
 The euro was down two thirds of a percent at 121.72 yen
after hitting an 11-month peak on Wednesday.
 The Australian dollar scaled a fresh 29-year peak against
the greenback of $1.0481 and rose to 89.45 yen, its highest
since September 2008, after data showed the Australian economy
added a higher-than-expected 37,800 jobs in March.

 By Elisabeth O'Leary
 MADRID, April 7 (Reuters) - Spain will not follow ailing
neighbour Portugal in seeking a European bailout, Spain's
Economy Minister said on Thursday, hoping Lisbon's move will
draw a line under Europe's debt crisis.
 Caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates announced late on
Wednesday that Portugal was asking for financing from the
European Union, the third euro zone member to do so after Greece
and Ireland last year. He argued the economic risks had now
become too great to go it alone after borrowing rates soared.
[ID:nLDE7352DS]
 The much-anticipated bailout could turn market attention
back to Spain and its weakened public finances, ahead of a
Treasury auction of three-year bonds at 10:40 a.m. (0840 GMT) on
Thursday.
 ""The market continues to give Madrid the benefit of any
doubt at the moment, but the auction performance will be
scrutinized for any hints of waning investor interest on this
front,"" Lloyds analysts wrote in a daily note.
 The risk premium on Spanish 10-year bonds compared with the
German benchmark narrowed slightly on Thursday morning, to 179
basis points. [ID:nLDE7331G9]
 Whether they fall further is likely to depend on investors
keeping faith with Madrid's drive to cut its deficit
aggressively and revive an almost-stagnant economy struggling
with high unemployment.
 A three-year bond similar to the one to be auctioned on
Thursday was trading at a yield of 3.34 percent ahead of the
auction , lower than earlier this week, indicating
Spain's borrowing costs could fall at the auction.
 
 SALGADO RULES OUT CONTAGION
 ""(The risk of contagion) is absolutely ruled out ... it has
been some time since the markets have known that our economy is
much more competitive,"" Economy Minister Elena Salgado told
national radio station SER.
 Spain had about 25 billion euros ($34 billion) in foreign
direct investment in Portugal in 2009, the last year of
available figures, and Spanish banks have $98.3 billion in total
exposure to the country next door, holding around a third of its
foreign-owned debt.
 Analysts say Spain is shielded as long as a rescue package
comes through for Lisbon, but some 8.5 percent of Spain's
exports are sent to its western neighbor, meaning that the
budget austerity that will accompany a bailout are likely to
have a knock-on effect. [ID:nLDE71K14K]
 ""Portugal's bailout request puts the likes of Spain under
the spotlight, but we are of the opinion that Spain will not
follow due to its improving fiscal situation and recovering
economy, while also passing key structural reforms in the labour
market and pensions,"" Credit Agricole analysts said in a note to
clients.
 
 ECB IMPACT
 Spain dragged itself out of an 18-month recession at the
start of last year but growth has stuttered since then and the
central bank and many economists doubt the economy can grow as
much as the government expects.
 Official forecasts for growth in 2012 and 2013 were cut to
2.3 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, pointing to the likely
impact of higher interest rates and oil prices.
[ID:nLDE73527C]
 But Salgado argued that a widely-expected quarter point
interest rate rise by the European Central Bank on Thursday
would not endanger an economy already dealing with harsh public
spending cutbacks and labour market reforms. 
 ""The impact of a small rise in rates is very slow. Mortgages
(in Spain) are only revised once a year and so the transmission
(of a rate rise) is not immediate,"" she said.
 Spanish banks are seen as among the most vulnerable in
Europe to a series of ECB rate hikes. Although one round of
higher rates will not cause problems, further hikes will squeeze
profit at banks and push already-stretched borrowers into
arrears, analysts said [ID:nLDE7340WD]

 TOKYO, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped from an 11-month
high against the yen and 14-month peak versus the dollar as
investors focused on how much room the European Central Bank has
for raising interest rates beyond a widely expected tightening
later in the day.	
 The yen held above a six-month trough against the dollar.
The Bank of Japan met market expectations that it would keep
monetary policy steady and signal its readiness to ease policy
further, bucking a global trend of central banks withdrawing
excess liquidity put in place during the financial crisis
[ID:nL3E7F70JG].	
 The ECB is set to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis
points for the first time since July 2008. Portugal's request
for a European bailout has not changed the view the ECB would
follow up with more interest rate hikes, but many believe the
euro has risen too fast too far and is overdue a correction.	
 Analysts also say ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet must
sound hawkish enough to keep alive expectations for around 100
basis points in rate hikes by November and for the euro to
achieve fresh gains.	
 ""The euro has rallied considerably on the ECB rate hike view
but it may be the case of buy the rumour sell on the fact,"" said
Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse.	
 ""The euro zone debt crisis has not stopped the ECB from
making hawkish comments. That means Portugal's story is not
going to stop a rate hike. The market is pricing in 100 bps of
rate hikes, but it may be difficult for us to really see that.""	
 The euro was down a quarter point on the day at $1.4297
, having risen to $1.4350, its highest since late January
2010, on Wednesday. 
 Near-term support is seen in the $1.4285-1.4250 area.
Failure to rise strongly above $1.4282 could open the way for a
move back to around $1.4160. 
 The dollar had risen as high as 85.54 , almost 10 yen
above its record low of 76.25 yen hit in March, days after
northeast Japan's devastating earthquake. By mid-afternoon it
had slipped to 85.17.	
 Resistance around the November high of 85.94 yen is
hindering the dollar's advance. The area around 85.40 to 85.95
includes a 50 percent retracement of the decline from the May
peak, as well as a downtrend line from the 2007 cycle high.	
 The euro was down two thirds of a percent at 121.77 yen
after hitting an 11-month peak on Wednesday.	
 Despite Thursday's rise, the yen is expected to face
long-term downward pressure from low interest rates and an
expected decline in Japan's trade surplus as the country imports
to rebuild the quake-hit region.	
 ""Japan's trade surplus is expected to shrink, which could
scale down fundamental upward pressure on the currency. But in
the near term, a lot of moves have been driven by speculative
flows and it may have moved too fast and now may be the time for
the market to cool down,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst at bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 The yield spread between two-year euro zone and Japanese
government bonds rose to 164.6 basis
points, its highest since December 2008.	
 
 RHETORIC	
 The euro zone debt crisis has had little influence on the
ECB's rhetoric. But higher euro zone interest rates would
likely make it difficult for debt-laden peripheral countries to
finance their deficits, by raising already high borrowing costs.

 Portugal became the third euro zone member to seek a bailout
from the European Union, with the size of the package expected
to be up to 80 billion euro ($114 billion). [ID:nLDE7350HL]	
 Beyond the near-term, higher oil prices are expected to
support the euro as resource-rich countries convert part of
their dollar revenues into the single currency to diversify.	
 Brent crude oil prices stood near the previous day's 2-1/2
year high near $123 a barrel , while the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a global commodities
benchmark, hit a one-month peak on Wednesday.	
 In Asia, where central banks are stepping up intervention,
euro demand from authorities which are also diversifying their
reserves is likely to offer the single currency a solid floor.	
 The expectation for higher euro zone rates contrasted with
uncertainty in the United States over when the Federal Reserve
may begin to tighten policy. The U.S. economy remains too
fragile for the Fed to begin raising rates, Atlanta Fed

 TOKYO, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro held below the previous
day's 11-month high against the yen and 14-month peak versus the
dollar as investors focused on how much room the European
Central Bank has for raising interest rates beyond a widely
expected tightening later in the day.	
 The yen remained near a six-month trough against the dollar.
The Bank of Japan is expected to keep monetary policy on hold
but signal its readiness to ease policy further, bucking a
global trend of central banks withdrawing excess liquidity put
in place during the financial crisis.	
 More tightening signals anticipated from the European
Central Bank helped to offset concerns about euro zone debt
after a Portuguese request for European financial aid, but many
believe the single currency is overdue for a correction after a
recent rally.	
 ""The market ignored Portugal's request for aid because it
was seen unlikely to stop the ECB from raising interest rates.
But the key is how much they are going to raise going forward,""
said Teppei Ino, an analyst at bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.4310 , having
risen to $1.4350, its highest since late January 2010, on
Wednesday. 
 The break of $1.4282 has seen the euro progress towards a
major 76.4 percent retracement at $1.4375 but a failure to rise
strongly beyond there could open the way for a move back to
around $1.4160. Near-term support is seen in the $1.4285-1.4250
area.	
 The dollar stood at 85.34 yen , having risen as high
as 85.54, almost 10 yen above its record low of 76.25 yen hit in

85.95 includes a 50 percent retracement of the decline from the
May peak, as well as a downtrend line from the 2007 cycle high.	
 The euro rose as high as 122.55 yen , just ticks
away from the previous day's 11-month peak.	
 The yield spread between two-year euro zone and Japanese
government bonds rose to 164.6 basis
points, its highest since December 2008.	
 The yen is expected to face long-term downward pressure from
low interest rates and an expected decline in Japan's trade
surplus as the country imports to rebuild the quake-hit region.	
 
 EURO AND ECB	
 The ECB is set to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis
points for the first time since July 2008. Many analysts say ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet must sound hawkish enough to keep
alive expectations for around 100 basis points in rate hikes
expected by November and for the euro to achieve fresh gains.	
 Another concern for the euro is the region's persistent debt
crisis. Portugal became the third euro zone member to seek a
bailout from the European Union, with the size of the package
expected to be around 60 billion to 80 billion euros ($85-114
billion).[ID:nLDE7350HL]	
 Higher euro zone interest rates would likely make it
difficult for debt-laden peripheral countries to finance their
deficits, by raising already high borrowing costs.	
 On the other hand, higher oil prices are expected to support
the euro as resource-rich countries convert part of their dollar
revenues into the single currency for diversification.	
 Brent crude oil prices rose to a 2-1/2 year high above $123
a barrel on Wednesday  while the Reuters-Jefferies CRB
index , a global commodities benchmark, hit a one-month
high on Wednesday.	
 In Asia, where central banks are stepping up intervention,
euro demand from authorities which are also diversifying their
reserves is likely to offer the single currency a solid floor.	
 The expectation for higher euro zone rates contrasted with
uncertainty in the United States over when the Federal Reserve
may begin to tighten policy. The U.S. economy remains too

 The Australian dollar scaled a fresh 29-year peak against
the dollar of $1.0481 and rose to 89.45 yen ,
its highest since September 2008, after data showed the economy

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro clung near a
14-month high against the dollar ahead of an expected euro zone
interest rate rise on Thursday, while gold drifted off a record
it scaled on the back of the U.S. currency's weakness and
inflation worries.	
 Asian shares were lacklustre, with the Nikkei crawling up,
as investors who had bet on falls in recent days realised their
gains, but markets elsewhere in the region lost some ground.
Major European indexes were seen opening flat-to-lower and S&P
500 index futures  weakened a little. 
 Brent crude oil eased off a two-and-a-half year peak struck
amid worries about war in Libya and unrest in the Middle East.	
 The Australian dollar , often seen as a play on
rising commodities prices because of Australia's large resource
sector, rose to a 29-year high against the dollar after stronger
than expected jobs data.	
 
 The Bank of Japan held its ultra-loose monetary policy
steady on Thursday, and signalled its readiness to take further
easing steps to support an economy struggling to avoid sliding
back into recession after a devastating earthquake last month.	
 In contrast, the European Central Bank, meeting later in the
day, was widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis
points from a record low 1 percent to curb inflationary
pressures, widening the single currency's yield advantage over
both the yen and the dollar.	
 Portugal's request for European financial aid -- seen as
inevitable by the bond markets for some weeks but resisted by
Lisbon until Wednesday -- was not expected to throw the ECB off
its hawkish course.	
 ""The yen has been falling on expectations of diverging
monetary policies between Japan, the United States and the euro
zone,"" said Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ analyst Teppei Ino.	
 ""The market ignored Portugal's request for aid because it

 Higher interest rates will make life harder for struggling
peripheral euro zone countries such as Portugal, Greece and
Ireland by increase their borrowing costs as the try to tackle a
crushing debt burden.	
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.4310 having risen
to $1.4350, its highest since late January 2010, on Wednesday. 
 The dollar stood at 85.25 yen , having risen as high
as 85.54 earlier, almost 10 yen above its record low of 76.25
yen hit in March, days after Japan's earthquake and tsunami.	
 The euro rose as high as 122.55 yen , just ticks
away from the previous day's 11-month peak, before easing back
to around 122 yen. 
 Some analysts said the euro has risen too far too fast, and
that ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet must sound hawkish enough
to keep alive expectations for around 100 basis points in rate
hikes by November for the euro to achieve fresh gains.	
 ""The euro has rallied considerably on the ECB rate hike view
but it may be the case of buy the rumour sell on the fact,"" said
Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse.	
 The Australian dollar rose as high as $1.0481, and also rose
to 89.45 yen , its highest since September 2008.	
 
 TURNING POINT	
 Expectations of a turning in the monetary policy cycle, with
other developed markets starting to tighten, knocked Japanese
government bonds lower. 
 Benchmark 10-year JGB futures fell 0.26 point to 138.72,
while the 10-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to 1.305 percent.
The yield spread between two-year euro zone and Japanese
government bonds rose to 164.6 basis
points, its highest since December 2008.	
 There was little immediate market reaction to news that U.S.
lawmakers had not reached an agreement to avert a government
shutdown in budget talks with President Barack Obama. 
 U.S. stocks inched up on Wednesday, with the S&P 500
gaining 0.2 percent, as a weekly survey from advisers Investors
Intelligence showed the percentage of bulls rose to the highest
level in nearly four months. [ID:nWEN0567] 
 Tokyo's Nikkei share average rose 0.1 percent, while
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares excluding Japan
fell the same amount. The MSCI index had hit a
succession of near three-year peaks in recent days. 
 Japanese shares have recouped more than two-thirds of the
losses sustained immediately after the March 11 earthquake, but
remain around 6.5 percent below their close on the day of the
disaster.	
 Market players said Thursday's gains were mostly due to
traders who had gone short -- or bet on falls -- in recent days
closing out their positions by buying back beaten down shares.	
 Investors remain cautious about the disruption to factories
and the crisis at a crippled nuclear power plant, which operator
Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) is still trying to
stabilise nearly four weeks after the quake.	
 ""The market is increasingly feeling that the TEPCO nuclear
problem will take a long time,"" said Takashi Ohba, a senior
strategist at Okasan Securities. ""People are also unsure about
production losses.""	
 Brent crude  eased 0.3 percent to $122.01 a barrel,

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, April 7 (Reuters) - The yen held near a six-month low
against the dollar on Thursday and an 11-month trough versus the
euro ahead of monetary policy meetings in Japan and the euro
zone that are expected to reinforce widening interest rate
differentials.	
 The euro held near the previous day's 14-month peak against
the dollar ahead of an expected euro zone interest rate hike,
with more tightening signals anticipated from the European
Central Bank seen offsetting concerns about the euro zone debt
after Portugal's request for European financial aid.	
 The Bank of Japan is expected to keep monetary policy on
hold but signal its readiness to ease policy further, bucking a
global trend of central banks withdrawing excess liquidity put
in place during the financial crisis.	
 Interest rate differentials have become the major driver in
currency markets, reviving interest in carry trades, which
involve selling the low-yielding yen to make overseas
investments that bring higher returns. 
 Many believe this trade may be running out of steam in the
near term, however, with Thursday's monetary policy meetings by
the BOJ and ECB possibly a catalyst for correction.	
 ""The yen has been falling on expectations of diverging
monetary policies between Japan, the United States and the euro
zone. The market ignored Portugal's request for aid because it
was seen unlikely to stop the ECB from raising interest rates,""
said Teppei Ino, an analyst at bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 ""Japan's trade surplus is expected to shrink, which could
scale down fundamental upward pressure on the currency. But in
the near term, a lot of moves have been driven by speculative
flows and it may have moved too fast and now may be the time for
the market to cool down.""	
 The dollar stood at 85.47 yen , having risen as high
as 85.54 earlier, almost 10 yen above its record low of 76.25
yen hit in March, days after Japan's earthquake. 
 ""Fears that Japanese manufacturing will be 'hollowed out' by
a stronger currency, the risk of further monetary easing by the
Bank of Japan, a lack of compelling investment options at home
for Japanese investors and the desire by local households to
earn higher returns abroad should all weigh on the yen in 2011
and 2012,"" UBS said in a note to clients.	
 UBS raised its long-term dollar/yen forecast to 90 yen by
the end of 2011 from 85, and 100 yen by the end of 2012 from 90.	
 In the near term however, resistance around the November
high of 85.94 yen is hindering the dollar's further advance. The
area around 85.40 to 85.95 includes a 50 percent retracement of
the decline from the May peak, as well as a downtrend line from
the 2007 cycle high.	
 The euro rose as high as 122.55 yen , just ticks
away from the previous day's 11-month peak.	
 The yield spread between two-year euro zone and Japanese
government bonds rose to 164.6 basis
points, its highest since December 2008.	
 The single European currency stood at $1.4328 , having
risen to $1.4350, its highest since late January 2010, on
Wednesday. 
 The ECB is set to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis
points for the first time since July 2008. Many analysts say ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet must sound hawkish enough to keep
alive expectations for around 100 basis points of rate hikes
expected by November and for the euro to enjoy fresh gains.	
 Another concern for the euro is the region's persistent debt
crisis. Portugal became the third euro zone member to seek a
bailout from the European Union, with the size of the package
expected to be around 60-80 billion euros ($85-114
billion).[ID:nLDE7350HL]	
 Higher euro zone interest rates would be likely to make it
difficult for debt-laden peripheral countries by raising their
already high borrowing costs.	
 On the other hand, higher oil prices are expected to support
the euro as oil-rich countries convert part of their dollar
revenues into the single currency for diversification. Brent
crude oil prices rose to a 2-1/2 year high above $123 a barrel
on Wednesday .	
 The expectation for higher euro zone rates contrasted with
uncertainty in the United States over when the Federal Reserve
may begin to tighten policy. The U.S. economy remains too
fragile for the Fed to begin raising rates, Atlanta Fed
President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday [ID:nN06207079]. 
 The dollar was steady at 75.563 against a basket of
currencies.

 * NZ govt would only take control if in public interest
 * Package to ensure no disruption to quake recovery
(Adds quotes, detail, background)	
 WELLINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - New Zealand's government has
agreed to provide financial support for AMI, the country's
second-largest residential insurer, after two major earthquakes
threatened to deplete its capital, Finance Minister Bill English
said on Thursday.	
 English said the potential cost for the government might be
as much as NZ$1 billion ($775 million), straining the budget
further, but would not scupper the government's plan to return
the budget to surplus.	
 ""This provides a financial backstop for policy holders so
the rebuilding of Christchurch is not jeopardised by potential
solvency or liquidity issues and so confidence is maintained in
the insurance sector,"" he said in a statement.	
 A funding shortfall is threatening the insurer as a result
of a flood of claims in the wake of two devastating earthquakes
in the South Island city of Christchurch in the past year.	
 ""This support package will give AMI the time to seek a
market solution,"" English said.	
 Official estimates of the cost of the Christchurch
earthquake on Feb 22 and an earlier quake in the region last
September are around NZ$15 billion ($11 billion), about 7
percent of the economy. 
 The AMI package would be called on only as a last resort if
AMI's own reserves have been exhausted - unless the government
believes it is in the public interest to take control sooner, he
added.	
 Christchurch-based AMI has 485,000 policy holders and 1.2
million policies across the country. The company is mutually
owned, meaning that its customers are also its owners, limiting
its ability to raise capital.	
 It said it had more than NZ$350 million in reserves but
could not allow uncertainty about its financial position to
remain.	
 ""We could not allow such concerns to mount and it was for
this reason that we asked government to stand behind us during
this difficult period,"" Chief Executive John Balmforth said in a
statement.	
 ""We will not draw down on the capital facility from
government unless we have to.""	
 In Christchurch, its home base, it has more than 85,000
policyholders with 225,000 policies - or about 35 per cent of
the residential insurance market in the city.	
 ""This is an unusual situation requiring a special response,""
English said.	
 If the package is called on, it would involve the government
investing up to NZ$1 billion in AMI, with the right to take
ownership and assume control of the company if it needs to, the
finance minister said.	
 English said the government's potential liability was
uncertain and would depend on the extent of claims on the
company.	
 ""There's a range of estimates and they range from zero, that
is the company may be able to meet all the claims, through to
about NZ$1 billion more claims than they are able to meet,""
English told reporters.	
 Asked if the potential cost would delay the government's
planned return to budget surplus by 2015/16, English said it
would be another headwind: ""It will not knock us off track,"" he
said.	
 On March 24 insurer rating firm A.M. Best downgraded AMI's
financial strength rating and issuer credit rating, with
negative implications citing the impact of the earthquake on its
capitalisation. 
 AMI said it would look to raise fresh capital, which could
involve selling parts of the company.	
 New Zealand's insurance sector is dominated by
Australian-owned companies, including IAG and AMP

 * Growth forecasts come as Doha trade talks in crisis
 
 GENEVA, April 7 (Reuters) - World trade will grow faster
than the 7 percent long-term average rate for a second
successive year in 2011 but fall short of last year's dramatic
rebound, the World Trade Organisation is likely to forecast on
Thursday.
 Forecasts based on a similar model of world trade to that of
the WTO by the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy
Analysis put 2011 merchandise trade growth, as measured by
volume of exports, at around 10 percent this year, down from an
estimated 15 percent in 2010 when trade volumes roared back
after shrinking 13 percent in 2009.
 The WTO, which will present its forecast for 2011 at around
1000 GMT, may also revise its estimate of trade growth last year
from a forecast of 13.5 percent made in December.
 China, the world's biggest exporter, saw its exports rise
12.9 percent in 2010, but the rate has slowed dramatically in
2011, according to national figures. Nevertheless, CPB economist
Gerard van Welzenis said growth in global trade is still being
driven by strong emerging market economies.
 ""Anything above 7 percent -- the long-term pre-crisis
average for about 10 years, is a very good performance,"" he told
Reuters.
 WTO Director General Pascal Lamy will present Thursday's
forecasts as he faces growing pressure to deliver progress on
the latest round of global trade talks aimed at keeping tariffs,
subsidies and other barriers to trade at bay.
 The so-called Doha round of WTO negotiations is widely seen
as in crisis because they are now almost a decade old, and
because failure to secure an agreement this year could leave the
talks in limbo as a number of key WTO members enter election
years in 2012.
 So would a failure of Doha restrict world trade growth?
 ""Not in the short term,"" says van Welzenis of the
semi-independent Dutch government body CPB. ""But this is a
matter for the long run. Even during the (financial) crisis (of
2008-2009) we might have expected governments to raise barriers,
but not much happened.""
 The WTO and its predecessor The General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) had played an important role over the past 50
years, he said. ""It's still important.""

(Adds details)
 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Wednesday a day ahead of an expected interest-rate hike in the
euro zone, while Portugal's about-face decision to request
financial aid from the European Union had little impact.
 Lisbon had held out hope that by steadily meeting budget
goals and cutting spending it could regain investor confidence
and avoid a bailout. But Portugal's situation worsened last
month after its government resigned, sending bond yields
soaring and sparking a series of rating downgrades.
 In announcing the decision in a televised statement,
Portugal's prime minister did not specify what type of aid nor
how much was being requested. For details see [ID:nLDE7350HL].
 The lack of market reaction suggested investors had already
viewed the request for aid as a foregone conclusion. The euro
was at a 14-month high against the dollar ahead of the expected
interest rate hike from the European Central Bank on Thursday.
 ""In some ways it is a positive -- I think Portugal was in
denial. On this side of the pond no one understood exactly how
Portugal was going to be able to dig out of its problems
without getting aid,"" said David Dietze, chief investment
strategist at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New
Jersey.
 The slumping greenback and strife and political unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East had sent Brent crude to a
2-1/2-year high above $123 a barrel before settling off its
highs.
 Among other commodities, gold racked up a record high and
silver rallied to a 31-year high for a third consecutive day.
Inflation fears have boosted precious metals, as oil and corn
prices reached new peaks in recent days. A weaker greenback
also makes dollar-priced assets more affordable to holders of
the euro and other currencies.
 Global equities gained on a generally brighter economic
picture and U.S. stocks ended higher with help from tech
shares. Volume on Wall Street was relatively light.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 32.85
points, or 0.27 percent, to end at 12,426.75. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 2.91 points, or 0.22 percent, to
1,335.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 8.63 points,
or 0.31 percent, to 2,799.82.
 World stocks, measured by the MSCI <.MIWD00000OOPUS>,
gained 0.4 percent.
 ECB RATE HIKE IN VIEW
 The euro was strong throughout the day ahead of the rate
decision and on speculation the ECB will also signal further
interest rate rises.
 Japan, on the other hand, looks set to lag other central
banks in tightening and the yen slumped to an 11-month low
against the euro and a six-month low against the dollar.
 The euro  was last up 0.8 percent at $1.4334 and
against the yen  it was up 1.4 percent at 122.45 yen.
 ""The markets are very bullish with respect to the
anticipated Trichet communique tomorrow. They expect quite
strongly that the ECB is heading toward normalization of
monetary policy,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency
strategist at OANDA in Toronto, referring to ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet.
 Spot gold  hit a record $1,461.91 an ounce before
easing to $1,458.90, up 0.6 percent. Silver  rose as high
as $39.75 an ounce. Brent crude  settled up 8 cents at
$122.30 a barrel. U.S. crude  settled up 49 cents at
$108.83.
 Earlier in the day, Portugal sold 1.005 billion euros
($1.43 billion) in 12- and six-month T-bills, but yields rose
sharply from last month's auctions.
 The 12-month T-bill yield rose to 5.902 percent from 4.331
percent in the auction three weeks ago, while the yield on the
shorter maturity rose to 5.117 percent from 2.984 percent in a
sale in early March.
 Demand, however, outstripped supply by 2.6 times for the
12-month bills and by 2.3 times for the six-months.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, April 6 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar 
powered to a three-year high against its U.S. counterpart on
Wednesday, underpinned by firm oil prices and the appeal of the
country's overall economic health, but the latest gains drew
words of caution from analysts.
 Already rising in the overseas session, the currency got a
further shot in the arm after the Ivey Purchasing Managers
Index showed purchasing activity rose to 73.2 last month from
70.8 in February. [ID:nN06114698]
 The data added to the growing view that the Bank of Canada
will raise interest rates in the coming months, which has also
helped the currency's resiliency.
 The currency closed higher for the seventh time in the past
eight sessions, for a gain of about 1.6 percent. It finished at
C$0.9604 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0412, up from Tuesday's
North American finish at C$0.9639 to the U.S. dollar, or
$1.0375.
 But it closed down moderately from an earlier high of
C$0.9569 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0450, its strongest level
since November 2007. It is still a long way from the record
high of that same month, which sits at C$0.9059 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.1039, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 The currency's appreciation, although gradual this year,
has piqued concern among some analysts at current levels,
particularly for a country with an export-oriented economy.
 ""At this point right now, if it continues to be this
strong, businesses might really start to suffer from that,""
said Mazen Issa, macro strategist at TD Securities.
 Still, Canada's high-flying dollar may have already reached
its strongest levels against the U.S. currency for the next
year, according to a Reuters poll. Median forecasts show the
currency is expected to ease throughout the coming 12 months.
[ID:nN06160269] [CAD/POLL]
 Technical chart points are vague around these levels
because the currency has not spent much time here, analysts
say.
 ""The risk for the Canadian dollar is that it moves too far,
too quickly and the central bank delays tightening as a
consequence, or attempts to talk the currency down,"" said
Fergal Smith, managing market strategist at Action Economics.
 He has pencilled in a rate hike call for July, but said a
more hawkish statement by the Bank of Canada at next Thursday's
Monetary Policy Report could bring forward that call.
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the central bank's key policy rate, have fully
priced in a rate hike by September. But odds of July have edged
up in recent sessions. 
 TWO-YEAR BOND NETS STRONG DEMAND
 While tighter monetary policy is expected later this year,
demand was still strong for the two-year bond, the part of the
curve that is particularly sensitive to interest rate changes.
 Canada's C$3.5 billion auction of two-year bonds, due 2013,
netted solid demand. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.6177 for the
new bond, down slightly from 2.69 in March. But Smith said the
ratio still compared favorably to the recent average.
 The ratio is a measure of investor demand and a reading
above 2 generally indicates a decent auction.
 ""Yields have backed up and they're back inside of the peak
reached in February,"" said Smith. ""The Canadian two-year yield
is trading more than 100 basis points over Treasuries.""
 Overall, Canadian bond prices were softer across the curve,
with the two-year bond  down 5 Canadian cents to
yield 1.889 percent, while the 10-year bond  lost 31
Canadian cents to yield 3.422 percent. The bonds mostly
outperformed against their U.S. counterparts.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Wednesday to
a 14-month high against the dollar on speculation the European
Central Bank will signal further interest rate rises following
an expected increase this week, though there's room for
disappointment.
 The yen slid to an 11-month low against the euro and a
six-month low against the dollar. More losses were expected for
the yen as investors such as macro hedge funds add to bearish
bets, with the Bank of Japan looking set to lag other central
banks in tightening policy.
 The ECB is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by
25 basis points on Thursday, its first increase since July
2008. Many analysts expect ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet to
continue sounding a hawkish tone on inflation, which would
stoke market expectations for more rate rises this year.
 ""The markets are very bullish with respect to the
anticipated Trichet communique tomorrow. They expect quite
strongly that the ECB is heading toward normalization of
monetary policy,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency
strategist at OANDA in Toronto.
 The expectation for higher euro zone rates contrasted with
uncertainty in the United States over when the Federal Reserve
may begin to tighten policy. The U.S. economy remains too
fragile for the Fed to begin raising rates, Atlanta Fed
President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4350, according to Reuters
data, its highest since late January 2010. It was last up 0.8
percent at $1.4334, shrugging off an announcement from
Portugal's caretaker government that it needs financing from
the European Union.
 Traders reported steady buying by Asian central banks, but
said large option barriers cited at $1.4350 and $1.4400 could
cap gains in the near term.
 Citigroup currency strategist Todd Elmer said euro zone
rate expectations are close to their recent peaks, with money
markets discounting more than 100 basis points of ECB
tightening through November.
 ""Expectations for ECB hawkishness are at unprecedented
levels since the onset of the financial crisis and this could
leave room for disappointment if President Trichet fails to
validate the moves in market interest rates at his press
conference tomorrow,"" he said in a note to clients.
 CARRY TRADE REVIVES
 The struggling yen was in danger of breaching key long-term
support levels against most currencies, having already fallen
to a 2-1/2-year low against the Australian dollar.
 The yen has slid since the first G7 intervention in a
decade last month after the earthquake in Japan, stirring talk
of a carry trade revival -- a strategy of selling low-yielding
currencies to fund investment in currencies with higher
interest rates.
 ""The yen is taking a lead as the global carry trade makes a
return with the Bank of Japan likely to ease policy while the
other central banks seek to tighten it,"" said Lena Komileva,
head of G-10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in
London.
 The euro was up 1.4 percent at 122.45 yen, having earlier
touched an 11-month peak, with stop-loss buying earlier in the
session adding to its rise.
 The dollar was up 0.6 percent at 85.43 yen, after hitting a
six-month peak of 85.52 yen, almost 10 yen above its record low
of 76.25 yen hit in March, days after Japan's northeast was
devastated by a massive earthquake and tsunami.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar surged to 89.28 yen,
its highest since September 2008, with 90 yen seen as the next
possible target.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.5
percent at 75.540.

 ""In some ways it is a positive -- I think Portugal was in
denial. On this side of the pond no one understood exactly how
Portugal was going to be able to dig out of its problems
without getting aid,"" said David Dietze, chief investment
strategist at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New
Jersey.
 Earlier in the day, Portugal sold a total of 1.005 billion
euros ($1.43 billion) in 12-month and six-month T-bills, but
yields rose sharply from last month's auctions.
 The slumping greenback and geopolitical unrest earlier sent
Brent crude to a 2-1/2-year high above $123 a barrel before
settling off its highs.
 Among other commodities, gold racked up a record high and
silver rallied to a 31-year high for a third consecutive day.
Inflation fears have boosted precious metals, as oil and corn
prices reached new peaks in recent days. A weaker greenback
also makes dollar-priced assets more affordable to holders of
the euro and other currencies.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Wednesday to
a 14-month high against the dollar on speculation the European
Central Bank will signal further interest rate rises following
an expected increase this week, though there's room for
disappointment.
 The yen slid to an 11-month low against the euro and a
six-month low against the dollar. More losses were expected for
the yen as investors such as macro hedge funds add to bearish
bets, with the Bank of Japan looking set to lag other central
banks in tightening policy.
 The ECB is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by
25 basis points on Thursday, its first increase since July
2008. Many analysts expect ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet to
continue sounding a hawkish tone on inflation, which would
stoke market expectations for more rate rises this year.
 ""The markets are very bullish with respect to the
anticipated Trichet communique tomorrow. They expect quite
strongly that the ECB is heading toward normalization of
monetary policy,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency
strategist at OANDA in Toronto.
 The expectation for higher euro zone interest rates
contrasted with uncertainty in the United States over when the
Federal Reserve may begin to tighten policy. The U.S. economy
remains too fragile for the Fed to begin raising interest
rates, the president of the Atlanta Fed, Dennis Lockhart, said
on Wednesday. [ID:nN06207079]
 The euro rose as high as $1.4350 , according to
Reuters data, its highest since late January 2010, and was last
up 0.8 percent at $1.4328.
 Traders reported steady buying by Asian central banks, but
said large option barriers cited at $1.4350 and $1.4400 could
cap gains in the near term.
 Citigroup currency strategist Todd Elmer said euro zone
rate expectations are close to their recent peaks, with money
markets discounting more than 100 basis points of ECB
tightening through November.
 ""Expectations for ECB hawkishness are at unprecedented
levels since the onset of the financial crisis and this could
leave room for disappointment if President Trichet fails to
validate the moves in market interest rates at his press
conference tomorrow,"" he said in a note clients.
 CARRY TRADE REVIVES
 The struggling yen was in danger of breaching key long-term
support levels against most currencies, having already fallen
to a 2-1/2 year low against the Australian dollar.
 The yen has slid since the first G7 intervention in a
decade last month, stirring talk of a carry trade revival -- a
strategy of selling low-yielding currencies to fund investment
in currencies with higher interest rates.
 ""The yen is taking a lead as the global carry trade makes a
return with the Bank of Japan likely to ease policy while the
other central banks seek to tighten it,"" said Lena Komileva,
head of G-10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in
London.

 The euro was up 1.3 percent at 122.35 yen, having earlier
touched an 11-month peak , with stop-loss buying
earlier in the session adding to its rise.
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 85.35 yen , after
hitting a six-month peak of 85.52 yen, almost 10 yen above its
record low of 76.25 yen hit in March, days after Japan's
northeast was devastated by a massive earthquake and tsunami.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar  surged to
89.28 yen, its highest since September 2008, with 90 yen seen
as the next possible target.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.5
percent at 75.504 <.DXY>.

 LISBON, April 6 (Reuters) - Portugal needs to resort to
financial aid from the European Union to overcome its financial
troubles, Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said on
Wednesday.
 ""In this difficult situation, which could have been avoided,
I understand that it is necessary to resort to the financing
mechanisms available within the European framework,"" he said in
comments reported in the online edition of business daily Jornal
de Negocios.
 A finance ministry spokeswoman confirmed the comments.
 It was not clear from his comment whether he was referring
to a short-term loan to secure financing until a June 5 snap
general election or a full-fledged bailout like those received
by Greece and Ireland -- and which markets widely expect Lisbon
to need next.
 So far the government, which will rule in caretaker capacity
until the elecion, has insisted no foreign aid is necessary.
 The country's leading bankers urged the caretaker government
on Tuesday to urgently seek a short-term loan to soothe fears in
financial markets until the election.
 Portugal's bond yields have shot higher and credit rating
agencies have downgraded the country's creditworthiness since
the Socialist government resigned last month after parliament
rejected an austerity plan.
 Economists overwhelmingly believe that Portugal will
eventually need a full bailout.

 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on
Wednesday ahead of an expected interest-rate hike in the euro
zone, while the weaker dollar and safe-haven appeal drove gold
to another record high.
 The slumping greenback and geopolitical unrest earlier
sent Brent crude to a fresh 2-1/2 year high above $123 a
barrel before turning lower as some said its recent gains were
overdone.
 The euro climbed against the dollar to its highest in more
than a year one day before the European Central Bank is widely
expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis
points to curb inflation pressures.
 The ECB has held rates at a record low 1.0 percent since
July 2008. The Bank of Japan, on the other hand, is expected
to keep interest rates low at its policy meeting on Thursday
following last month's massive earthquake and tsunami, and the
yen slid to an 11-month low against the euro and a six-month
low versus the dollar. 
 Among other commodities, silver rallied to a 31-year high
for a third consecutive day. Inflation fears have boosted
precious metals, as oil and corn prices reached new peaks in
recent days. A weaker greenback also makes dollar-priced
assets more affordable to holders of the euro and other
currencies.
""It is unquestionable that the demand for precious metals
derives from the devaluation of the leading currencies -- the
dollar, the pound and the euro,"" said Angelos Damaskos, a fund
manager at Sector Investment Managers.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4350 , according to
Reuters data, its highest since late January 2010. It last
traded up 0.9 percent at $1.4342. Against the yen ,
it was up 1.3 percent at 122.35 yen.
 Spot gold  hit a record $1,461.91 an ounce and was
later up 0.3 percent at $1,455.34 an ounce. Silver  rose
as high as $39.75. Brent crude  was down 39 cents at
$121.83 a barrel after hitting its highest level since August
2008. U.S. crude  was slightly lower around $108.27.
 STOCK MARKET CONSOLIDATION
 Global equities gained on a generally brighter economic
picture though U.S. stocks were little changed in the early
afternoon before the start of earnings season next week.
 Portugal added support after the battered euro zone
peripheral economy successfully sold six- and 12-month
treasury bills but had to pay a steep price in interest.
[ID:nLDE7350HL]
 Emerging markets also rose, helped by renewed interest due
to higher expectations for interest rates in developed
markets. Shares of European banks rose after the successful
Portuguese debt auction. [ID:nLDE7301MN]
 World stocks, measured by the MSCI <.MIWD00000OOPUS>,gained 0.3 percent. An emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> rose
0.7 percent. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.3

 The market is ""basically poised and waiting to see if
these (earnings) numbers will support the upside,"" said Marc
Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in San

 Pado said that earnings could push the S&P 500 to 1,385 by
early May.
 Data showing that German industrial orders soared above
expectations in February brightened the outlook for Europe's
top economy. Orders grew by 2.4 percent on the month, compared
to the Reuters forecast for an increase of 0.6 percent.
[ID:nLDE7350XH].
 Portugal sold a total of 1.005 billion euros ($1.43
billion) in 12-month and six-month T-bills, but yields rose
sharply from last month's auctions.
 The 12-month T-bill yield rose to 5.902 percent from 4.331
percent in the auction three weeks ago, while the yield on the
shorter maturity rose to 5.117 percent from 2.984 percent in a
sale in early March.
 Demand, however, outstripped supply by 2.6 times for the
12-month t-bills and by 2.3 times for the six-month T-bills.

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, April 6 (Reuters) - The world's top economies are
likely to set next week a cornerstone of a system for correcting
economic imbalances, and open the door to future inclusion of
China's renminbi in the SDR currency basket, a G20 source said.
 Finance ministers and central bank governors from the 20
biggest developing and developed economies meet on April 15 in
Washington to decide, among other things, how to use a list of
economic indicators agreed in February to detect worrying trends
that could lead to global economic crises.
 Setting up the list was tough because China, which manages
its currency to help exports and has amassed the world's biggest
currency reserves as a result, blocked the inclusion of exchange
rates and currency reserves in the set of indicators.
 But it does include including public debt and fiscal
deficits, private savings and borrowings, and balance of
payments components.[ID:nLDE71I02C]
 Setting common numerical thresholds for signalling
imbalances would have been even more challenging to agree
because different economic models give different results.
 ""There are now four models on the table, one is structural
and three are statistical,"" a G20 source with insight into the
preparation of the Washington meeting said.
 ""If you give countries a choice, they will never agree on
the best method, as all have limitations. So what we will try to
agree -- and I think it will go through one way or another -- is
to use a combination of these methods,"" the G20 source said.
 ""I think that we will reach an agreement, we are
sufficiently close.""
 A deal would eliminate the need to agree a single threshold
number for an indicator for all G20 countries, which would be
politically sensitive for different countries and indicators.
 ""Within each method of course there will be numbers, but
since the methods are different, there will be no single magic
number,"" the G20 source said.
 ""We would use all the four methods and if two out of the
four or two out of three say that a country might show excessive
imbalances, then you move to the next stage,"" the source said.
 
 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
 The next stage would involve the International Monetary Fund
and the country in question analysing the imbalances and
proposing remedial action.
 G20 countries that would go to the stage of an in-depth IMF
analysis and then get policy recommendations would be limited to
""systemically important"" ones, the source said.
 If the screening methods are agreed in Washington next week,
the process could start immediately with a view to having the
analysis ready for the next G20 ministerial meeting in October.
 Ideally, recommendations would be ready for a G20 leaders'
summit in November, the G20 source said, noting however, that no
timetable has been agreed yet.
 G20 finance leaders will also discuss an overhaul of the
global monetary system, controls on the flow of capital,
financial safety nets, how to identify which financial
institutions are too big to fail and liquidity provision.
 
 RENMINBI AND SDR
 Part of the monetary overhaul could be to include the
currency of the world's now second biggest economy, China, in
the basket that makes up the Special Drawing Right (SDR) -- an
international reserve asset of the IMF.
 Some economists say a bigger base for the SDR could help cut
an overreliance on the dollar as the world's reserve currency.
 The basket is now made up of four currencies -- the dollar,
euro, pound sterling and Japanese yen. Created in 1969 it does
not reflect the rising importance of China.
 But the United States and Europe say China's renminbi could
only become part of the SDR once Beijing allows the market to
set the unit's exchange rate.
 Since this is unlikely to happen very soon, the source said,
the G20 is likely to signal the possibility that the currency
might become part of the SDR basket in the future.
 ""In the G20 conclusions it is likely to be phrased in a more
veiled way,"" the source said.

 LIMA, April 6 (Reuters) - Mexico and Peru signed a trade
agreement on Wednesday after five years of negotiations, one of
many efforts by outgoing President Alan Garcia to find new
markets for Peruvian goods as the local economy booms.
 The agreement should enter force in July, when Garcia
leaves office, Peru's trade minister, Eduardo Ferreyros,
said.
 It marks Peru's 10th trade pact from Asia to Europe. The
country's talks with Mexico stalled during the global recession
of 2009.
 ""We have free-trade agreements with the United States,
China and the European Union for our agricultural and fishery
goods,"" Ferreyros said. ""This agreement is important for our
small businesses and manufacturing sector.""
 Domestic demand and construction have outpaced mining as
the traditional growth engine in Peru, one of the world's
fastest growing economies.
 The Andean nation has talks ongoing with the nine members
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group that would
create the so-called Trans Pacific Partnership trade area.
 ""We already have agreements with Colombia and Chile; this
is going to permit us to have a more profound integration with
the Pacific and integrate with Asian markets,"" Ferreyros said.
 Mexico sought to exclude some agricultural goods from
preferential status during negotiations with Peru to protect
its domestic market. Mexico, Latin America's second largest
economy, sends roughly 80 percent of its exports to the United
States.
 ""This is a step forward for the decade of Latin America,""
Mexican Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari said during the signing
ceremony.

 * Expert says levels not dangerous
 * Tourist arrivals plunge in peak season
 * Sparks debate over nuclear safety in the U.S.
(Adds TEPCO statement, trace radioactivity detected in China)	
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 7 (Reuters) - Japan's neighbours sounded
increasingly alarmed over the risk of radiation from the
crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, while figures showed the
number of foreign visitors to the country had slumped during
what should be the peak tourist season.	
 The world's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years is also
raising concern over safety in the United States, which has more
atomic reactors than any other country, especially at one plant
which is similar to the one in Fukushima wrecked by last month's
9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami.	
 Engineers, who sealed a leak this week that had allowed
highly radioactive water into the sea, are now pumping nitrogen
into one reactor to prevent the risk of a hydrogen gas
explosion, and want to start the process in another two
reactors. 
 Operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) said
late on Thursday it did not expect it would have to dump any
more contaminated water into the ocean after Saturday. 
 Earlier, TEPCO said the chance of a repeat of the
gas explosions that damaged two reactors in the first days of
the disaster was ""extremely small"".	
 But as engineers battle multiple crises -- some the result
of efforts to try to cool reactors -- officials admit it could
take months to bring the reactors under control and years to
clear up the toxic mess left behind at the plant 240 km (150
miles) north of Tokyo.	
 ""Data shows the reactors are in a stable condition, but we
are not out of the woods yet,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio
Edano told reporters.	
 The government has already set up a 20 km (12 miles)
exclusion zone around the plant, banned fishing along much of
the northeast coast and set up evacuation centres for the tens
of thousands forced to leave their homes following the crisis.	
 The March 11 quake and giant tsunami waves it triggered
killed, or left missing, about 28,000 people.	
 
 Trace levels of radioactive material have been detected
in the air in 22 Chinese provinces but the amounts did not pose
a threat to health or the environment, China's state news agency
Xinhua said. 
 Earlier, China's Health Ministry said traces of
radioactivity in spinach had been found in three provinces.
[ID:nL3E7F62LF]	
 India has banned Japanese food imports for three months.
[ID:nL3E7F606G]	
 In South Korea, some schools closed because parents were
worried that rain across the country could be toxic.	
 ""We've sent out an official communication today that schools
should try to refrain from outdoor activities,"" an education
official in South Korea said. [ID:nL3E7F7077]	
 South Korea's nuclear safety agency reported a small level
of radioactive iodine and caesium particles in rain but said it
was not enough to be a public health concern.	
 The few schools that closed on Thursday were expected
to reopen on Friday if the rain stopped. 
 
 CRITICISM	
 There has been repeated criticism of Japan for a lack of
information about the crisis.	
 In Vienna on Wednesday, Japanese nuclear officials faced
some tough questioning from other countries, diplomatic sources
said.
    ""People were asking pointed questions seeking
information, the Russians were critical,"" one source said after
the closed-door meeting, part of a conference scheduled long
before earthquake.	
 The source said a Russian official at the meeting had
suggested there was a need for an improved emergency reaction.	
 Though Japan's capital is back to normal almost four weeks
after the disaster, foreign tourists are staying away. Many
airlines have reduced flights to Japan . 
 This week is the peak of the cherry blossom season which
normally attracts large numbers of tourists. But government
figures released showed that compared with the same time a year
ago, the number of visitors since March 11 had tumbled 75
percent.	
 Japan's central bank highlighted the risks for an already
fragile economy at the end of its two-day policy review.	
 ""Japan's economy is under strong downward pressure, mainly
on production, due to the earthquake,"" the Bank of Japan
said after the review at which it kept interest rates unchanged
and launched measures to help banks in the devastated northeast.	
 It also cut its economic assessment and warned of more
uncertainty over the outlook, signalling it stood ready to ease
monetary policy further as the nuclear crisis and rolling power
blackouts hit output and business sentiment. [ID:nL3E7F70JG]	
 The government is discussing an emergency budget, expected
to be about 4 trillion yen ($47 billion), to help with recovery
and reconstruction but there is no agreement on how to raise
money in a country where public debt is already nearly double
the size of the economy.	
 
 SAFETY CONCERNS	
 In Vienna, the head of a U.N. scientific body said the
accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant was not expected to have
any serious impact on health, based on information he had.	
 Wolfgang Weiss, chairman of the United Nations Scientific
Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, said the disaster
was less dramatic than Chernobyl in 1986 but ""much more serious""
than Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979.	
 ""We have seen traces of iodine in the air all over the world
now but they are much, much, much lower than traces we have seen
at similar distances after Chernobyl,"" he added. [ID:nLDE73529F]	
 In Washington, Democratic lawmakers raised concern about
whether regulators and the nuclear power industry were doing
enough to ensure U.S. reactors could withstand worst-case
scenarios.	
 Worries focused on a Pennsylvania nuclear plant with the
same kind of reactor design as the Fukushima plant.	
 Some lawmakers argued that the U.S. plant could be at risk
of meltdown in the case of a severe emergency. [ID:nL3E7F62A5]	
 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is conducting special
inspections at two Illinois nuclear plants operated by Exelon
Corp after routine checks in February found a problem
with backup pumps that would be used to remove heat from the
reactors in case of an accident.

prices to fresh peaks.
 The euro surged more than 1 percent against the Japanese
yen , hitting an 11-month high, one day before the
European Central Bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark
interest rate by 25 basis points to curb inflation pressures.
 The ECB has held rates at a record low 1.0 percent since
July 2008. The Bank of Japan, on the other hand, is expected to
keep interest rates low at its policy meeting on Thursday
following last month's massive earthquake and tsunami.

 Among commodities, spot gold  rose to a record high,
silver  touched a 31-year high, and Brent crude 
rose $1 to break through $123 a barrel, its highest level since
August 2008. U.S. crude  rose above $109 to its highest

 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a more than
one-year high year against the dollar on Wednesday ahead of an
expected interest rate hike in the euro zone, while global
equities gained on a generally brighter economic picture.
 Gold rose to a record high, silver touched a 31-year high,
and oil held above $122 a barrel, as unrest in the Middle East
continued to drive safety bids and the weaker dollar lent
support. A weaker greenback makes dollar-priced assets more
affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies.
 U.S. stocks opened higher as investors bet the upcoming
earnings season and more merger activity will continue to lift
the market. Mining shares rose with gold prices.
 Emerging markets also rose, helped by renewed interest due
to higher expectations for interest rates in developed markets.

 ""There's optimism earnings will be good for the first
quarter,"" said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook
Investments in Lisle, Illinois.
 ""Semiconductors are up on expectation of more M&A activity
in the tech sector,"" he said.
 Portugal added to the positive tone after the battered euro
zone peripheral economy successfully sold six- and 12-month
treasury bills but had to pay a steep price in interest.
[ID:nLDE7350HL]
 The European Central Bank meets Thursday and is widely
expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis
points from a record low 1.0 percent to curb inflation
pressures. 
 The prospect of the euro zone's first rise in rates since
July 2008 pushed the euro to its highest level against the
dollar since late January 2010.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4317 , according to
Reuters data, and last traded up 0.5 percent at $1.4293.
 Against the yen the euro hit its highest level since May
2010, rising to a high 121.96 yen . It was last up 0.9
percent at 121.88 yen.
 The yen was expected to suffer more losses as investors
continue to expect the Bank of Japan to lag other central banks
in tightening policy.
 The dollar weakness supported oil prices, which held near a
2-1/2-year peak. Brent crude  was up 83 cents at
$123.05.
 ""Central bankers will always claim that they have no
influence on oil prices but recent history has repetitively
shown that in the new world, where commodities are a global
asset, central bankers can have a greater influence on oil
prices than OPEC,"" said Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix.
 Spot gold  hit another record high, rising to
$1,460.60 an ounce. Silver  rose to $39.48 an ounce, its
highest since January 1980.
 OPTIMISM RULES
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000OOPUS> were up
0.4 percent percent. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> gained
0.8 percent, while Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> gained
0.4 percent.
 Shares of European banks rose after the successful
Portuguese debt auction.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 39.51 points,
or 0.32 percent, to 12,433.41. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> rose 5.08 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,337.71. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 15.66 points, or 0.56
percent, at 2,806.85.
 Data showing that German industrial orders soared above
expectations in February brightened the outlook for Europe's
top economy. Orders grew by 2.4 percent on the month, compared
to the Reuters forecast for an increase of 0.6 percent.
[ID:nLDE7350XH].
 ""Optimism continues to rule even though there are still ...
clear and present dangers. Portugal needs to find some
financing fast,"" said Philippe Gijsels, analyst at BNP Paribas
Fortis Global Markets.
 Portugal sold a total of 1.005 billion euros ($1.43
billion) in 12-month and six-month T-bills, but yields rose
sharply from previous auctions last month.
 The 12-month T-bill yield rose to 5.902 percent from 4.331
percent in the previous auction three weeks ago, while the
yield on the shorter maturity rose to 5.117 percent from 2.984
percent in a sale in early March.
 Demand, however, outstripped supply by 2.6 times for the
12-month t-bills and by 2.3 times for the six-month T-bills.
 ""The bill auctions show that Portugal is able to fund
itself in the bill markets, but the cost is substantially
higher than previous auctions,"" said Peter Chatwell, rate
strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""I suspect that as far as the market is concerned, funding
at these levels can only be viewed as a temporary measure.""
 Portugal is struggling hard to avoid being overwhelmed by
its debt burden.

 * Dollar still seen hitting 90 yen in a year's time
 * Swiss franc to depreciate against euro in a year

By Anooja Debnath and Yati Himatsingka
 BANGALORE, April 6 (Reuters) - Coordinated currency
intervention coupled with a possible return to carry trades will
weaken the yen, even as repatriation flows after Japan's
devastating earthquake provide support, a Reuters poll showed.
 A monthly survey of over 60 strategists, taken April 1-6,
saw the dollar at 83 yen in a month from now, 86 in six months
and 90 in a year -- exactly the same levels as seen in the
previous month's survey.
 The dollar closed at 83.15 yen on March 31 and was trading
around 85 earlier on Wednesday as the Japanese currency hit a
six-month low.
 Only two analysts saw the yen over the next year
strengthening past its post-World War Two record of 76.25 per
dollar hit in March, but the poll showed a wide range of views.
 Twenty-two of 58 common analysts in this poll and the last
have downgraded their forecasts and see a weaker yen in a year,
while 17 upgraded them.
 Major central banks from the Group of Seven nations
intervened in currency markets to stabilise the dollar/yen last
month as domestic investors scurried to meet payment obligations
in the aftermath of Japan's biggest earthquake on record.
 ""Now the yen is even weaker than before the catastrophe.
This, to us, looks like an exaggeration as the repatriation need
persists and heightened risk aversion should also play out in
favour of the yen,"" said Sebastian Wanke, economist at DekaBank.
 Japan's former currency czar Eisuke Sakakibara said on
Monday the yen will keep weakening over the next few months and
possibly fall beyond 90 to the dollar as severe market turmoil
might prompt the G7 nations to jointly intervene again.
 The yen has been on a downward trend since the rare joint
intervention last month revived interest in the yen ""carry
trade"" -- a strategy of using cheap yen loans to fund higher
yielding investments.
 The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to keep interest rates
on hold at its two-day meeting starting Wednesday, but signal
its readiness to embark on further easing of its ultra-loose
policy as the environmental disaster triggered by the March 11
earthquake threatens to tip the economy back into recession.
 
 RATE HIKES
 In contrast, there are strong expectations the European
Central Bank will bump its key policy rate up 25 basis points
from a record low 1 percent on Thursday to curb inflationary
pressures, with markets already pricing in more tightening later
in the year.
 ""The determination of the Japanese authorities to prevent
the yen from strengthening, taken together with adverse yield
differentials and prospects of the yen regaining its mantle of
funding currency, point to increasing downside risks,"" said
Mitul Kotecha, head of global foreign exchange research at
CA-CIB.
 Favourable yield differentials as U.S. Treasury yields move
up faster than their Japanese counterparts, coupled with
brightening prospects for the U.S. economy will add strength to
the greenback.
 Minutes from the Fed's March 15 meeting, released on
Tuesday, showed a few officials thought a stronger economy could
warrant tightening monetary conditions this year, although
others believed the Fed could maintain its ultra-loose stance
beyond 2011.
 ""I think the risks (to USD/JPY) are to the upside, but it
won't be so much a yen story as a dollar story should we get
more positive data, and monetary policy expectations in the FOMC
are brought forward,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.
 The yen's annualised volatility hit a 10-month high of 15.6
percent in March in the immediate aftermath of the devastation
caused by the earthquake but is seen falling to 11.6 percent in
April.
 Cross rates calculated by Reuters saw the euro trade at 118
yen in a month, 119 in six and 122 in a year, compared with 113,
115 and 119 yen respectively seen in last month's survey.
 The poll also showed calculated euro Swiss franc cross rates
at 1.31 in a month, 1.32 in six months and 1.35 in a year. Those
consensus forecasts were 1.29, 1.31 and 1.35 in last month's
poll.

 * Sterling to creep higher vs dollar and euro over 12 months
 * Interest rate differentials to give cable a boost
 * Pound volatility seen similar to March, around 7.5 percent
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Sterling will probably waver
near current levels for the next few months before diverging
interest rate policies around the world help push it higher
against the dollar, a Reuters poll found.
 The survey of over 60 foreign exchange analysts this week
showed the pound trading near $1.61 over the next three months,
before appreciating to $1.64 in a year's time -- slightly
stronger than the $1.62 seen in last month's poll.
 Sterling came within sight of a 14-month high on Wednesday,
hovering near a two-week peak of $1.6354, although it later fell
half a cent after data showed British industrial output suffered
a shock fall in February.
 With British economic data still looking temperamental,
analysts looked to the country's expected interest rate profile
as a firmer starting point for sterling forecasts.
 The Bank of England is expected to leave interest rates at a
record low 0.5 percent on Thursday, although several analysts
expect it to hike rates in May, with the consensus pointing to a
third quarter hike.
 That would in any case put the BoE several months ahead of
the U.S. Federal Reserve in starting a cycle of policy
tightening, since most leading economists say the Fed will hold
rates near zero throughout 2011.
 At 4.4 percent in February, UK consumer price inflation was
running more than double the BoE's target of 2 percent and it is
unlikely to ease much over the course of this year. Economic
growth is expected to remain weak.
 ""The policy dilemma the BoE is currently facing between
inflation and growth is quite severe,"" said Roberto Mialich from
UniCredit, historically one of the poll's most accurate
contributors.
 ""Nonetheless, as the BoE is also expected to hike rates
sometime later this year, widening interest rate differentials,
in particular in relation to the USD, should still make a cable
pullback above $1.70 feasible by late December-early 2012.""
 Forecasts for the 12-month timeframe ranged from $1.41 to
$1.82.
 Analysts retained forecasts for a gradual appreciation of
sterling against the euro.
 While the European Central Bank looks almost certain to pip
the BoE to a first interest rate hike since the recession, the
ongoing fiscal crisis afflicting the euro zone's periphery will
depress sentiment for the common European currency.
 The poll showed the euro staying at current levels near 87.7
pence in a month's time, before a slow depreciation to 87 pence
in three months, 85.5 in six, and 84.1 pence in a year.
 Judging from calculations derived from the standard
deviations of the poll's forecasts, sterling should show a
similar level of volatility this month -- around 7.5 percent --
as it did in March, when its actual volatility was 7.6 percent.

 * Euro to slip from current highs versus dollar
 * Common currency to also lose ground against pound

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro will steadily lose the
recent ground it has gained against the dollar in the coming
year as the U.S. Federal Reserve plays catch-up to the European
Central Bank's interest rate hikes, a Reuters poll found.
 The euro  has gained over 11 percent since hitting a
4-month low of $1.286 in January and while median forecasts from
the 66 strategists in the poll did not see it sinking that low
again in the next 12 months, there was a wide range of views.
 The common currency is seen at $1.42 in one month, $1.39 in
six and $1.36 in a year according to the poll taken this week, a
slightly stronger outlook than results in a poll taken in early
March.
 Forecasts for the 12-month outlook ranged from $1.15 to
$2.50, highlighting an uncertain outlook for the euro.
 The euro is seen as the most volatile of the major currency
pairs this month, with the poll implying the highest volatility
since late 2010 of 16.8 percent. Analysts say the divergence of
forecasts in Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator
of exchange rate volatility in the following month. [VOL/POLL]
 But expectations for an interest rate hike by the ECB this
week have helped push the euro to a 14-month high of around
1.43, despite concerns that Portugal will have to seek a bailout
from the European Union. [ID:nN05113951]
 The ECB is widely seen raising interest rates by 25 basis
points from their record low of 1 percent when it meets on
Thursday, and following that with similar hikes each quarter
through to next year. The U.S. Federal Reserve is not seen
tightening policy until early 2012. [ECB/INT] [FED/R]
 ""Markets have already priced in 75 basis points of rate
hikes by the ECB, suggesting little scope for more EUR upside,""
said Mitul Kotecha at CA-CIB, the most accurate forecaster in
Reuters forex polls so far this year. [FX/RANK2]
""Unless there is a sharp improvement in sentiment towards
the euro zone periphery, EUR will likely face growing pressure.""
 The euro zone economy grew 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2010 and is expected to have expanded 0.5 percent in the
first three months of this year, but data indicates a strong
German economy is masking continued weakness in periphery
members of the 17-nation bloc.  [EUR/PMIS]
 Growth in the U.S. service sector slowed last month, data
showed on Tuesday, strengthening the case of some top Fed
officials who argue the economy is not yet strong enough to
warrant removing the massive support provided by its central
bank.
 STERLING STRENGTHENS
 The euro  will weaken against the pound over the
next 12 months as the Bank of England embarks on its own
monetary tightening regime, battling to control inflation
running at more than twice its 2 percent target.
 The common currency was seen worth 87.7 pence in one month,
85.5p in six months and 84.1p in 12. The respective forecasts in
the March poll were for 84.8p, 83.3p and 82.6p.
 ""With inflation running well above the upper band, and
expected to push higher, we believe the BoE could become more
hawkish in its rhetoric, flattening the curve and strengthening
the currency,"" said Meng Xiao at BofAML.

 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro rose to its highest
in more than a year against the dollar ahead of an expected ECB
rate hike, while the yen slid on Wednesday to an 11-month low
against the euro and a six-month low against the dollar.
 More losses were expected for the yen as investors, such as
macro hedge funds, add to bearish bets, with the Bank of Japan
looking set to lag other central banks in tightening policy.
 In contrast, the European Central Bank is widely
anticipated to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis points on
Thursday and follow that with other rate hikes later in the
year.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4317, according to Reuters
data, its highest since late January 2010, with traders
reporting steady buying by Asian central banks. Large option
barriers cited at $1.4350 and $1.4400 could cap gains in the
near term, however. It last traded up 0.5 percent at $1.4293.
 ""The euro (move) is all on interest rate expectations,""
said John Doyle, strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
""It looks more like a series of interest rate hikes.""
 The struggling Japanese currency was in danger of
breaching key long-term support levels against most currencies,
having already fallen to a 2-1/2 year low against the
Australian dollar.
 The yen has slid since the first G7 intervention in a
decade last month, stirring talk of a carry trade revival -- a
strategy of selling low-yielding currencies to fund investment
in currencies with higher interest rates.
 ""The yen is taking a lead as the global carry trade makes a
return with the Bank of Japan likely to ease policy while the
other central banks seek to tighten it,"" said Lena Komileva,
head of G-10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 The euro was up 0.9 percent at 121.88 yen, having earlier
touching an 11-month peak, with stop-loss buying earlier in the
session adding to its rise.
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 85.20 yen, easing from
highs on profit taking by Japanese retail investors.
 It scaled a six-month peak having surged 12 percent from
its post-World War Two record low of 76.25 yen hit in March,
days after Japan's northeast was devastated by a massive
earthquake and tsunami.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar surged to 88.68 yen,
its highest since September 2008, with 90 yen seen as the next
possible target. 
 The dollar fell 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.9176 francs.
 An earlier report showed Swiss consumer price inflation
rose by more than expected in March. Although Swiss inflation
remains low by international standards as the strong franc has
largely shielded the country from rising oil and food prices,
the data could raise pressure on the Swiss National Bank to
tighten rates.

 * Petrolimex's Q1 loss of $127 mln worst quarterly loss
 * Tough to secure fuel supply due to financial woes-co
source

 By Ngo Thi Ngoc Chau	
 HANOI, April 6 (Reuters) - Petrolimex, Vietnam's top petrol
distributor, faces major problems after a record first-quarter
loss and has sought government permission to repay foreign
currency loans at a preferential exchange rate to help it
secure fuel supply, an executive and state media said.	
 The Hanoi-based, state-run group estimated that it incurred
a loss of 2.65 trillion dong ($126.9 million) in the first three
months of this year, its biggest quarterly loss ever, Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Vuong Thai Dung told Reuters.	
 The distributor, which controls around 60 percent of the
country's pumping network, reported a pre-tax profit of 1.21
trillion dong last year.	
 State oil and gas group Petrovietnam's subsidiaries
Petrovietnam Oil Corp and Petec Trading and Investment Corp
faced a combined loss of 780 billion dong, the Saigon Tiep Thi
newspaper cited Vu Quang Nam, deputy CEO of Petrovietnam as
saying, without explaining reasons for the loss.	
 An 8.5 percent devaluation of the dong on Feb. 11 alone
resulted in Petrolimex's loss of 1.85 trillion dong and the
group is now in an ""ailing situation"", Saigon Tiep Thi said.	
 Petrolimex has dollar loans worth $1.1 billion, state media
has reported. It needs around $6 billion a year to import oil
products.	
 The group gets dollar loans from banks for imported fuel,
but the amount it owed on outstanding loans soared in dong terms
after the February devaluation, Dung said.	
 ""We borrowed dollars at the former rate and now have to pay
at a much higher one,"" he said.	
 The loss also resulted from the group's task to secure
supply, which pushed the firm's domestic market share up by more
than 20 percentage points to 80 percent in the first quarter, he
said.	
 ""While other distributors may have stopped supplying (fuel)
or sold in small amounts over the past few months, we had to
keep supply stable to ensure energy safety,"" Dung added.	
 Distributors said they had suffered a loss of around 2,900
dong per litre of petrol in February, which prompted the Finance
Ministry to institute a double-digit price hike on Feb. 24 and
another increase late last month. These came after Vietnam
refrained from price hikes for six months during which time
Brent crude had jumped by about a third.	
 
 
 SEEKING SPECIAL MECHANISM	
 Petrolimex said it was asking for a ""special mechanism"" from
the government under which it would be allowed to fix the
foreign exchange rate at a particular point of time before the
Feb. 11 devaluation and apply that rate to its outstanding
loans.	
 ""We do have cash, but in dong. We cannot buy dollars or pay
the banks at the current rate, which is so tough for us,"" Dung
said.	
 A company source who declined to be identified by name said
it would be difficult for Petrolimex to ensure supply in the
coming time given its financial woes.	
 The group has not restarted buying products from Dung Quat,
Vietnam's only domestic refinery, since the facility resumed
production late last week after a 10-day shutdown for equipment
checks, the source added.	
 Vietnam is Asia's No. 2 importer of gasoline, taking an
average 3.8 million tonnes a year (2.5 million barrels a month),
a third of Indonesia's imports. Vietnam also imports about 4.4
million tonnes a year (nearly 3 million barrels a month) of
diesel, almost 40 percent of import demand from top importer
Indonesia.	
 Economists say importers of essential goods, such as oil
products and fertiliser, would feel the heat from the
devaluation more than others because other importers were
already effectively forced to buy dollars from banks above the
official one before the devaluation.	
 Vietnam has been grappling with some of the highest
inflation in the region, with the March annual rate hitting
13.89 percent and the April rate widely expected to exceed 14
percent.	
 The Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday Vietnam's
inflation may reach an annual rate of 16 percent in the third
quarter of this year.	
 The Finance Ministry said in a statement it had
used all available financial measures to keep petrol prices
unchanged to ease inflationary pressures, but increases were
unavoidable.	
 It had slashed import duties on petrol, diesel, fuel oil and
kerosene to zero and requested distributors to maintain
operation and supply with no profits. The petrol price
stabilisation fund had gone empty, state media quoted
distributors as saying.	
 Dung said the Ministry of Industry and Trade has said it
cares about the group's operation. ""But now we have to wait for
decisions from the government,"" he added.

 GENEVA, April 6 (Reuters) - Rebels fighting Muammar Gaddafi
in Libya have asked the United Nations to help them restart oil
and gas exports from ports they control, according to a U.N.
statement.
 The statement confirmed what the rebel Transitional National
Council said this week after a visit by a U.N. special envoy.
 It did not provide any information on what the U.N. might
do, and a spokeswoman was unable to clarify the U.N. position on
Wednesday.
 ""The council raised concerns about the lack of funds as well
as issues surrounding the marketing and sale of oil and gas in
Libya, stressing that the issues required urgent attention in
order to enable the economy to function effectively,"" the U.N.
statement quoted its special envoy Abdel Elah al-Khatib as
saying after a meeting with Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the chairman of
the council.
 A tanker arrived at an east Libyan port on Tuesday to load
the first crude cargo since unrest shut down exports in early
March, but mystery surrounded the potential buyer.
 Although Qatar has said it will market Libyan crude, oil
traders are wary of breaking U.N. sanctions against the country
which were designed to put pressure on the Gaddafi regime.
 Before the crisis, Libya was exporting around 1.3 million
barrels per day and since exports were halted, Brent crude
futures have risen by around 20 percent to above $120 a barrel.
 Shipping sources said last week Libyan oil shipments were at
a standstill, with no one attempting to hire tankers due to
violence and the impact of sanctions on Gaddafi.
 NATO has also been enforcing a U.N. arms embargo in
international waters aimed at stopping the ""flow of arms and
mercenaries"" to Gaddafi. Ship officials said the move may add
disruptions for Libya-bound vessels.

 * The IMF says more must be done to cut current account gap
 * Minsk has not applied for a Fund facility
(Writes through with IMF comments)
 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, April 6 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund
on Wednesday urged Belarus to tighten its monetary and fiscal
policy as the former Soviet republic's foreign currency reserves
fell to a two-year low.
 Belarus' reserves calculated according to the IMF standards
were down at $3.761 billion as of April 1 from $4.023 billion on
March 1, the central bank said in a statement, as the population
rushed to buy foreign currency.
 Comparative figures showed that this was the lowest level in
reserves since the global economic downturn of 2009 when Belarus
had to turn to the IMF for a $3.6 billion bailout facility.
 This time, however, Belarus has not asked the Fund for
assistance, Chris Jarvis, the head of the IMF mission to Belarus
told reporters in Minsk through a video link.
 ""I can tell you we have not received any requests,"" Jarvis
said through an interpreter.
 After losing a quarter of its reserves so far this year, the
central bank halted foreign currency sales in mid-March as the
government asked Russia and other ex-Soviet states for a $3
billion bailout package.
 It has allowed the Belarussian rouble  to devalue by
10 percent from the official rate on the over-the-counter market
but analysts say further devaluation may be needed.
 The bank restarted forex sales this month but has said it
would only sell as much as it can buy and would not deplete
reserves -- which now cover only about one month of imports --
any further.
 
 'CUT SPENDING, RAISE RATES'
 Belarus' 2009 deal with the IMF has been described by both
sides as successful.
 But after the IMF programme expired -- and in the run-up to
the December 2010 presidential election -- President Alexander
Lukashenko's government embarked on a spending spree that
included generous public sector wage increases.
 Lukashenko won the vote to secure a fourth term in office
but Western governments have criticised the poll and the
subsequent crackdown on opposition protests. The United States
and the EU have since introduced sanctions against Lukashenko.
 Jarvis said the currency measures taken so far gave the
Belarus authorities some time to come up with a comprehensive
action plan but were not a solution by themselves.
 ""I believe that more needs to be done to reduce the current
account deficit and restore trust in the economy and in the
rouble,"" he said.
 ""We think it is necessary to reduce budget deficit and
significantly cut lending under government programmes... (and)
to tighten the monetary policy, in particular, by raising
interest rates so they are positive in real terms.""
 Belarus' central bank raised its key interest by 200 basis
points to 12 percent in February. Consumer prices rose by 13
percent year-on-year in the same month.
 Jarvis said Belarus could add more flexibility to the
exchange rate but declined to say what level of devaluation
would be appropriate.
 Analysts say Western governments could block Belarus'
attempts to secure fresh IMF funding.
 The Fund itself has said that ""any future financial
arrangement should be accompanied by a credible commitment to
strong stability-oriented policies and an ambitious structural
reform agenda"".

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - The yen hit a 11-month low
against the euro and a six-month low against the dollar on
Wednesday, with more losses in store as investors such as macro
hedge funds add to bearish bets on the Japanese currency.
 The euro also rose to a 14-month high of $1.4315 on steady
buying by Asian central banks, with large option barriers cited
at $1.4350 and $1.4400 which could cap gains in the near term.
 The euro has been buoyed by policymakers' signals that the
European Central Bank will raise its benchmark interest rate on
Thursday despite the debt crisis in the bloc's weaker economies.
Portugal's auction of six- and 12-month T-bills met healthy
demand from investors bidding at higher yields.
 The focus in the currency markets was, however, on the
struggling yen which was threatening to breach key long-term
support levels against most currencies, having already fallen to
a 2-1/2 year low against the Australian dollar.
 The yen has slid since the first G7 intervention in a decade
last month, stirring talk about the revival of carry trades, a
strategy of selling low-yielding currencies to fund investment
in currencies with higher interest rates.
 Market players say the broader trend points to a
continuation of yen weakness, given growing expectations that
the Bank of Japan will lag the ECB and the Federal Reserve in
raising interest rates.
 ""The yen is taking a lead as the global carry trade makes a
return with the Bank of Japan likely to ease policy while the
other central banks seek to tighten it,"" said Lena Komileva,
head of G-10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 ""Global risk sentiment is picking up and there is abundant
liquidity which is even isolating the euro from its peripheral
debt problems.""
 The euro hit an 11-month peak of 121.97 yen, up nearly 1
percent, with stop-loss buying earlier in the session adding to
its rise. The high-yielding Australian dollar
, surged to 88.68 yen, its highest since September 2008, with 90
yen seen as the next possible target.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent to 85 yen, easing from highs
on profit taking by Japanese retail investors. It scaled a
six-month peak of 85.53 yen, having surged 12 percent from its
post-World War Two record low of 76.25 yen hit in March, days
after Japan's northeast was devastated by a massive earthquake
and tsunami.
 DOLLAR/YEN NEAR RESISTANCE
 Some market players say the dollar's rise above its 200-day
moving average last week suggests that a long-term uptrend in
the yen is about to shift, drawing investors who may have missed
some yen weakness in late March to jump on the move.
 The dollar is heading toward more chart resistance against
the yen. Trendline resistance drawn off its June 2007 peak
around 124 yen now lies roughly around 85.65 yen. Its 55-week
moving average comes in near 85.80 yen, followed by the dollar's
mid-September peak at 85.94 yen.
 The latter level is key because it was a high in dollar/yen
reached after Japan intervened in currency markets for the first
time in six years in September 2010.
 Commerzbank said in a note dollar/yen was poised to
challenge the next band of resistance. ""We would allow for
profit taking here but then look for a break higher to 87.55 yen
then 94.50,"" it said.
 Indeed, macro funds, already running long dollar and short
yen positions, are said to be looking to buy topside strikes
above 90 yen with 1-3 month maturities.
 The euro is also near some longer term resistance levels. On
weekly Ichimoku charts, a form of Japanese technical analysis
that is widely used among market players, the top of the cloud
comes in right around 122 yen while the 100-week moving average
lies near 121.76 yen.
 The Bank of Japan ends its two-day meeting on Thursday and
should at least signal a willingness to ease further, if needed
. In contrast, the ECB is certain to raise rates for the first
time since July 2008 on Thursday.
 ""The euro has priced in a rate hike by the ECB,"" said Brown
Bothers' Komileva. ""But what is driving the euro/dollar higher
is the contrasting nature of communication between the Fed and
the ECB.""
 Fed minutes released on Tuesday did not spring any major
surprises and there was nothing to suggest an early end to its
""QE2"" programme of bond-buying.

 LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - The yen extended losses on
Wednesday, hitting a 11-month low against the euro and a

investors like macro hedge funds add to bearish bets.
 The Japanese currency was threatening to breach key

 The euro rose to a 14-month high of $1.4292, on buying by

intervening to cap a rise in their currencies in recent sessions
and recycling those proceeds into the euro.

past two days in dollar/yen options with a strike price of 90
yen that mature in August.

 * Stocks buoyant, led by emerging markets
 * Wall Street set for gains
 * Portugal sells bill, but pays price
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Differing prospects for interest
rates sent the euro to a 14-month high against the dollar and
extended the yen's steep decline on Wednesday as investors
prepared for the launch of a tightening cycle in the euro zone.
 World shares ticked higher, with emerging markets leading
the way -- a reflection of renewed interest in the sector
prompted in part by higher expectations for interest rates in
developed markets.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher.
 Focus was also on battered euro zone peripheral economy
Portugal. It successfully sold six- and 12-month treasury bills
but had to pay a steep price in interest.
 The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and is widely
expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points
from a record low 1.0 percent to curb inflation pressures.
 The prospect of the euro zone's first rise in rates since
July 2008 pushed the euro to its highest level against the
dollar since late January 2010.
 It rose as high as $1.4317 and also hit a high of 121.96 yen
, its strongest since May 2010. It was later slightly weaker
than these levels.
 The Bank of Japan also meets on Thursday but if anything it
will ease monetary conditions rather than tighten, adding to the
attraction of higher-yielding currencies such as the euro.
 The generally brighter picture of the world economy that
lies behind the trend towards rising rates has pushed stocks
steadily higher this year and there were more gains, briefly
lifting European shares to a four-week high.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up a third of a
percent. Emerging market stocks gained around three quarters of
a percent. The latter are up more than 10 percent since a
mid-March low.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 gained 0.4 percent.
 ""Optimism continues to rule even though there are still ...
clear and present dangers. Portugal needs to find some financing
fast,"" said Philippe Gijsels, analyst at BNP Paribas Fortis
Global Markets.
 ""The market will continue to be well supported as long as
the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to put liquidity into the
system. Only when the Fed stops printing will we be able to see
the real strength of the economy and markets. And then markets
may be disappointed.""
 
 PORTUGAL
 Portugal sold a total of 1.005 billion euros ($1.43 billion)
in 12-month and six-month T-bills, but yields rose sharply from
previous auctions last month.
 The 12-month T-bill yield rose to 5.902 percent from 4.331
percent in the previous auction three weeks ago, while the yield
on the shorter maturity rose to 5.117 percent from 2.984 percent
in a sale in early March.
 Demand, however, outstripped supply by 2.6 times for the
12-month t-bills and by 2.3 times for the six-month T-bills.
 ""The bill auctions show that Portugal is able to fund itself
in the bill markets, but the cost is substantially higher than
previous auctions,"" said Peter Chatwell, rate strategist at
Credit Agricole.
 ""I suspect that as far as the market is concerned, funding
at these levels can only be viewed as a temporary measure.""
 Portugal is struggling hard to avoid being overwhelmed by
its debt burden.
 Moody's cut the credit ratings of seven Portuguese banks on
Wednesday, pointing to the lenders' weakened financial state and
the likelihood a government struggling with debt would limit
support for them.
 The decision, including downgrades by one or more notches of
the senior debt and deposit ratings of seven banks, and
downgrades of the standalone credit assessment for five of those
banks, comes after Moody's cut Portugal's sovereign rating on
Tuesday.

 * Urges traders to buy c.bank bill, repos
 * China paper says room for more policy tightening
(Adds details)	
 BEIJING/SHANGHAI, April 6 (Reuters) - China still has too
much cash in its economy so the battle to tame inflation is a
challenge, a central bank official told traders on Wednesday,
suggesting more monetary policy tightening lies ahead.	
 Just a day after China raised interest rates for the fourth
time since October, a central bank official told traders the
bank was straining to contain money pouring in from capital
inflows, maturing central bank bills and bond repurchase
agreements (repos).	
 As such, the central bank hopes Chinese banks can buy more
of central bank bills and repos, traders who attended the
meeting quoted the official as saying.	
 The central bank had held the meeting with primary dealers
in its open market operations to discuss the nature of the
operations in the year ahead.	
 At the meeting, an official said the inflation outlook was
""not optimistic"", making this year's credit controls a difficult
task, traders who attended the meeting said.	
 The official added that China needed to consider the policy
changes of foreign central banks when setting its monetary
policy, traders said.	
 Excess cash is among drivers of China's inflation and is a
worry for the government as rising prices have stirred social
unrest in the past.	
 To drain the economy of a surfeit of cash, the central bank
has leaned on raising interest rates and banks' reserve
requirement ratio, as well as selling central bank bills and
bonds repurchase agreements. 
 But some of its efforts are being undone by maturing bills
and repos. In April alone, a total of 870 billion yuan ($133
billion) worth of bills and repos are maturing. 
 The central bank's efforts to sell bills are not always
smooth. 
 Sales flopped at the start of the year after commercial
banks, betting on rate rises, refused to step in as buyers in
the hope of holding out for better returns when rates go up.	
 The central bank's dour outlook on prices echoes that of a
prominent Chinese newspaper.	
 The official China Securities Journal said on Wednesday
China's inflation could run at its fastest in over two years in
coming months by topping 6 percent, keeping up the need for
further policy tightening.	
 ""There is still room for interest rates, the reserve
requirement ratio and the exchange rate to move higher,"" the
newspaper said in a front-page editorial 
 ""It's unlikely that monetary policy will be loosened in the
second quarter or even over a longer period of time."" 
 The paper said the consumer price index will likely stay
above 5 percent and perhaps quicken to an annual pace of 6
percent in the second quarter. 
 To get a handle over price pressures, it said China might
allow the yuan to rise more than 5 percent this year.	
 The prediction seemed to ring true on Wednesday. The yuan
hit a record peak against the dollar after the
central bank guided the Chinese currency to an all-time high.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, April 6 (Reuters) - The yen extended a
steep decline on Wednesday, hitting a 2-1/2 year low against the
Australian dollar and an 11-month trough against the euro,
threatening a breach of long-term support levels that could pave
the way for further losses.	
 The Japanese currency also hit a six-month low against the
U.S. dollar, with traders citing yen-selling by macro hedge
funds and Japanese importers. 
 The yen and other currencies with very low interest rates
such as the Swiss franc have slid over the past couple of weeks
as market volatility declined, stirring talk about the revival
of carry trades, a tactic of selling low-yielding currencies to
fund investment in currencies with higher interest rates. 
 The yen's decline brought it close to a series of support
levels against the dollar clustered roughly between 85.65 yen to
86.00 yen, suggesting that the dollar will slow its ascent
against the yen in the near term.	
 But market players say the broader trend points to a
continuation of yen weakness, given strengthening expectations
that the Bank of Japan will lag behind other central banks in
raising interest rates.	
 ""The yen is weakening due to expectations for interest rates
to rise abroad,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities' foreign securities department in Tokyo.	
 ""In countries other than Japan there are moves toward
raising interest rates or exiting from extreme monetary
easing... But in Japan, a massive amount of funds have been
pumped into the money market as an emergency measure, and there
is no talk of raising interest rates,"" Soma said.	
 The Australian dollar surged 0.7 percent to 88.27 yen
, having earlier climbed to a high of 88.68 yen, its
highest since September 2008, with 90 yen seen as the next
possible target.	
 The euro hit an 11-month peak of 121.91 yen on
trading platform EBS. It last stood at 121.66 yen, up 0.8
percent, with stop-loss buying having added to its rise. 
 The euro rose to a five-month high of $1.4282 . A rise
beyond its November peak of $1.4283 would take the euro to its
highest since January 2010. 
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 85.30 yen. The dollar scaled
a six-month peak of 85.53 yen , having surged 12 percent
from its post-World War Two record low of 76.25 yen hit in
March, days after Japan's northeast was devastated by a massive
earthquake and tsunami.	
 That surge in the yen prompted the G7 into a rare bout of
joint intervention that helped curb market volatility and
ultimately led to the start of the yen's downtrend.

 Some market players say the dollar's rise above its 200-day
moving average last week may be a sign that a long-term uptrend
in the yen is about to shift, inviting investors who may have
missed some yen weakness in late March to jump on the move in
April.	
 The dollar is heading toward more chart resistance against
the yen. Trendline resistance drawn off its June 2007 peak
around 124 yen now lies roughly around 85.65 yen. Its 55-week
moving average comes in near 85.80 yen, followed by the dollar's
mid-September peak at 85.94 yen.	
 The latter level is key because it was a high in dollar/yen
reached after Japan intervened in currency markets for the first
time in six years. 
 ""If you look at longer term charts, it looks like we may be
at a turning point,"" said Soma at Okasan Securities.	
 ""If the dollar breaks above 85.94 yen, we could see a test
of levels around 90 yen,"" he added.	
 In a sign of such market sentiment, market players said
there has been active trade the past two days in dollar/yen
options with a strike price of 90 yen that mature in August.	
 The euro is also right near some longer term resistance
levels. On weekly Ichimoku charts, a form of Japanese technical
analysis that is widely used among market players, the top of
the cloud comes in right around 122 yen while the 100-week
moving average lies near 121.76 yen.	
 The Bank of Japan meets today and Thursday and should at
least signal a willingness to ease further if needed
[ID:nL3E7F53CH]. In contrast, the European Central Bank is all
but certain to hike rates for the first time since July 2008 on
Thursday.[ID:nN05113951]	
 ""We expect that Trichet will confirm the importance of
carefully monitoring inflation, and against a backdrop of a Fed
unlikely to move swiftly to (remove) USD liquidity ... our bias
remains for a higher EURUSD post-ECB,"" BNP Paribas analysts said
in a note, adding that their target for the euro was $1.45.

(Adds details)	
 MADRID, April 6 (Reuters) - Portugal has to prove to its
creditors that it is taking the measures necessary to get its
economy into shape, the head of the International Monetary Fund
said on Wednesday.	
 ""The situation is in the hands of the Portuguese government
... it has to prove to its creditors that it is taking the right
steps,"" IMF Managing Director chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn told
newspaper El Pais in a joint interview with the Washington Post
and La Repubblica.	
 Spain by contrast had no need of financial help, he said.	
 Asked about inflation and pressures on the euro, he said
""Inflation is a great risk for emerging countries whose
economies are overheating, but it is not a great risk now for
developed countries.""	
 He added that exchanges rates should not be used as a excuse
to avoid necessary adjustments.	
 The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates on
Thursday as a signal that it is concerned about inflation,
rather than debt. 
 Those expectations have helped push the euro to a
five-month high against the U.S. dollar, despite concerns that
Portugal will have to seek a bailout from the European
Union.[ID:nN05113951]	
 Strauss-Kahn said no one country could provide a lasting
solution to global or regional issues.	
 ""A large part of the problem is precisely that the eurozone
lacks instruments of collective government. On the other hand,
this is not just a problem of what policy is in force right now,
but of leadership in Europe,"" he said.

 By John Mair	
 MANILA/HONG KONG, April 6 (Reuters) - Some of Asia's
emerging economies are showing signs of overheating,
underscoring the need for further policy tightening and more
flexible foreign exchange rates to tackle growing inflationary
pressures, the Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday.	
 Developing Asia, a diverse group of economies including
China, India, Azerbaijan, Thailand and Fiji, is expected to grow
7.8 percent in 2011 and 7.7 percent in 2012, robust rates albeit
slower than the 9 percent seen in 2010, the ADB said in its
latest Asian Development Outlook report.	
 At the same time, inflation is expected to quicken to an
average 5.3 percent this year from 4.4 percent in 2010, before
easing to 4.6 percent in 2012, the ADB said. Some countries such
as Vietnam and Pakistan could see inflation rates climb well
into the double digits.	
 ""There is some sign of overheating, some need for more
policy tightening in future,"" ADB chief economist Changyong Rhee
said at a media briefing in Hong Kong, speaking generally of
Asian inflation.	
 ""Developing Asia is home to two-thirds of the world's poor
and it is they who are most vulnerable to the effects of price
increases,"" he said. ""Policymakers must therefore consider
preemptive action to control inflation before it accelerates.""	
 Higher interest rates alone may not be enough to tamp down
price pressures, Rhee added, urging policymakers to use a
variety of measures to curb inflation, including allowing
greater flexibility in their currencies and capital controls.	
 ""The region's outlook is for continued strong growth in
2011- 2012, but with the threat of inflation looming closer,""
the ADB said in its report.	
 ""When weighing their macroeconomic policy choices, many of
developing Asia's policy makers see that the balance has tipped
toward avoiding overheating."" 
 Besides rising food and fuel prices, other risks to regional
growth included soft job and housing markets in the United
States, Europe's debt problems, and the economic impact of last
month's massive earthquake in Japan and nuclear crisis, the ADB
said.	
 
 The ADB, which said its report was generally based on data
available up to March 16, said the impact of Japan's disaster
was hard to quantify, but was likely to impact negatively on the
country's economic growth for the next two quarters, with
minimal spillover disruptions to other Asian economies.	
 ""The impact on Japan in the short run will be large . in the
next two quarters for example, but I think the long run economic
prospects will be less dire and the impact on other regions will
be contained. I don't think there will be a very significant
threat to other regions at this moment,"" said Rhee. 
 
 INFLATION THREAT	
 China, in particular, could do more to tighten monetary
policy, the ADB said, even after Beijing raised interest rates
on Tuesday for the fourth time since October. Inflation in China
is running at around 5 percent and could accelerate further in
coming months. See [ID:nL3E7F51LX].	
 ""Unless the Chinese government sees the stabilization of
inflation in a short period of time, I think they may have to
consider more tightening,"" Rhee said.	
 A surge in inflation, particularly food price inflation,
could pull down those who are currently just above the poverty
line, making it a social as well as economic concern, the ADB
said.	
 The report said recent estimates showed a 10 percent rise in
domestic food prices would raise the number of poor in
developing Asia by about 64 million, or more than 7 percent.	
 ""High inflation is a direct threat to stable and inclusive
growth since rising domestic prices can lead to social
tensions,"" the ADB said, singling out Vietnam as among the most
at risk from rising prices.	
 Inflation in Vietnam could reach 13.3 percent this year, the
second highest in the region after Pakistan, which could see
inflation of 16 percent, the ADB said.	
 But tackling inflation driven by global and supply-side
factors can put policymakers in a difficult position.	
 Steps such as tariff cuts and export bans have varying
success, and there could also be problems with local
infrastructure or domestic supply chains that exacerbate price
pressures.
 Raising interest rates can also attract more foreign
inflows, which adds to pressure from currencies to appreciate
and creates greater liquidity in domestic money supply,
compounding problems for policymakers.	
 Allowing currencies to appreciate was effective when dealing
with a sustained surge of inflows, but could cause problems if
the inflows are temporary, the ADB said.	
 ""Unfortunately, distinguishing between permanent and
temporary capital inflows is difficult, so countries will have
to decide on the nature of problem while taking the necessary
actions.""

Chinese central bank said on Wednesday that liquidity in the
country's financial market remained excessive, making its fight

meeting with the official said.	
 The inflation situation this year is still ""not optimistic"",
making this year's credit controls still a difficult task, the

spearheading a global recovery and the challenge for
policymakers is to normalise policy to head off inflation and
overheating, the Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday.	
 Developing Asia, a diverse group of economies including
China, India, Azerbaijan, Thailand and Fiji, is expected to grow
7.8 percent in 2011 and 7.7 percent in 2012, robust rates albeit
slower than the 9 percent seen in 2010.	
 Risks to growth included soft job and housing markets in the
United States, Europe's debt problems, the economic impact of
last month's massive earthquake in Japan and rising commodity
prices, which are being stoked by upheavals in North Africa and
the Middle East.	
 ""The region's outlook, however, is for continued strong
growth in 2011- 2012, but with the threat of inflation looming
closer,"" the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook report.	
 ""When weighing their macroeconomic policy choices, many of
developing Asia's policy makers see that the balance has tipped
toward avoiding overheating.""	
 The ADB, which said its report was generally based on data
available up to March 16, said the impact of Japan's disaster
was hard to quantify, but was likely to be temporary and
limited.	
 ""This benign baseline scenario assumes no major aftershocks,
extended power shortages, or massive radiation leaks from the
Fukushima plant.""	
 
 The ADB said there were two important challenges for Asia to
sustain growth that would cut poverty: the need to tackle rising
inflation and foster new sources of growth.	
 ""High and volatile oil and food prices will in particular
reverberate through the world economy, and they are likely to
stay that way in 2011-2012. They will thus be a significant
source of global inflation, especially in developing countries
where recovery is firmly under way.""	
 Asia's strong recovery from the global financial crisis has
seen its central banks raise interest rates to try to stem
inflationary pressures. On Tuesday, China raised interest rates
for the fourth time since October. See [ID:nL3E7F51LX]	
 South-South ties -- links between the developing countries
of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East -- were
developing, the ADB said, and could potentially create an
alternative growth engine to reliance on the developed world.
 The share of world merchandise trade among countries in the
South more than doubled in less than two decades, from 7% in
1990 to 17% in 2009, the ADB said.	
 
 INFLATION A POVERTY RISK	
 A surge in inflation, particularly food price inflation,
could pull down those who are currently just above the poverty

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, April 6 (Reuters) - The yen fell as the Bank of
Japan began a meeting on Wednesday that may signal its readiness
to further loosen monetary policy to support the economy, while
the prospect of more cheap money from Tokyo helped boost shares
elsewhere in Asia	
 Brent crude oil hovered below a two-and-a-half year high it
struck amid war in Libya and unrest in the Middle East. 
 Gold sat just below its record as China's fourth rate rise
since October and oil prices fuelled concerns about inflation
that helped propel the precious metal, traditionally a hedge
against rising prices as well as a safe haven investment.	
 European shares were seen edging up, extending a rally that
has taken them to their highest in nearly four weeks. Financial
spreadbetters called the major European indexes to open 0.2-0.3
percent higher, while S&P 500 index futures  pointed to
modest gains on Wall Street after a flat finish on Tuesday. 
 
 
 CARRY TRADE	
 The yen has been on a downward trend since a rare joint
intervention by leading central banks to weaken it last month
revived interest in the yen ""carry trade"" -- a strategy of using
cheap yen loans to fund higher yielding investments.	
 ""The yen is weakening due to expectations for interest rates
to rise abroad,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan
Securities' foreign securities department in Tokyo. 
""In countries other than Japan, there are moves towards
raising interest rates or exiting from extreme monetary
easing... But in Japan, a massive amount of funds have been
pumped into the money market as an emergency measure.""	
Japan's Nikkei share average closed down 0.3 percent.
A weaker yen ought to be positive for Japan's heavyweight
exporters, but investors remain concerned about production
capacity knocked out by the devastating March 11 earthquake. 
 ""The dollar going above 85 yen is a significant
breakthrough,"" said Hiroaki Osakabe, a fund manager at Chibagin
Asset Management. ""But carmakers and other manufacturers have to
be able to produce at full capacity first to really feel
positive impact. That's why they're not surging on the news.""	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
reached its highest in nearly three years. It
rose 0.6 percent, led by a 1.5 percent gain for its tech
sub-index . Shanghai stocks were up more
than 1 percent and Taiwan shares gained 1.7 percent. 
 Market players said the yen carry trade was encouraging the
foreign fund flows that often set the direction for emerging
Asia stocks.	
 ""Japan will be pumping lots of money into its financial
system, which would lure foreign investors back to emerging
markets such as South Korea and Taiwan,"" said Robert Hsieh, an
assistant vice president at Shin Kong Financial's fund arm.	
 The Bank of Japan is expected to keep policy on hold at its
two-day meeting that started on Wednesday, but signal its
readiness to embark on further easing as damage from the
earthquake threatens to tip the economy back into recession.	
 In contrast, there are strong expectations the European
Central Bank will bump its key policy rate up 25 basis points
from a record low 1 percent on Thursday to curb inflationary
pressures, with markets already pricing in more tightening later
in the year.	
 The euro bought around 121.60 yen , having rise as
far as 121.89 yen, its highest in 11 months, and the Australian
dollar was at 88.30 yen , having reached a
two-and-a-half year high of 88.68 yen.	
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 85.35 yen, having scaled a
six-month peak of 85.53 yen . The U.S. currency has surged
12 percent from its post-World War Two low of 76.25 yen hit in
March, days after Japan's northeast was devastated by the
magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami.	
 The euro traded around $1.4268 , matching a five-month
high reached on Monday.	
 Minutes of last month's Federal Reserve policy-setting
meeting, released on Tuesday, showed the U.S. central bank
appeared intent to complete a $600 billion bond-buying plan and
to keep rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended
period. [ID:nN05147451] 
 With both the Fed and BOJ keeping ultra-loose monetary
policy in place, investors have been using the yen and dollar as
funding currencies to buy higher yielding assets, including
currencies tied to commodity markets such as the Australian
dollar, or where policymakers are expected to allow appreciation
to help dampen inflation.	
 ""Foreign investors appear to be taking on a yen carry
trade,"" said Kim Soo-young, a market analyst at KB Investment &
Securities in Seoul. 
 
 TIGHTENING CYCLE	
 Copper prices rose in London and Shanghai futures
jumped 1 percent  after a two-day holiday. 
 Past Chinese rate rises have been seen as negative for
stocks and commodities on the worry that a slowing economy might
crimp China's growing demand for industrial raw materials,
manufacturing components and, increasingly, finished goods.	
 But the latest 25 basis point rise, announced by Beijing
late Tuesday, was viewed as just the latest step in a tightening
cycle which has been going on for some time and was expected to
continue.	
 ""The market has become comfortable with tighter Chinese
policy,"" said a metals trader in Singapore.	
 ""We were looking at three rate rises this year so it's not
unexpected and they also seem to be in the habit of announcing
these things during market holidays.""	
 Brent crude  eased 0.2 percent to $122 a barrel,
having jumped to a two-and-a-half year high on Tuesday. U.S.
crude  weakened 0.2 percent to $108.17 a barrel.	
 Gold traded around $1,453.15 an ounce, after rising
as far as $1,456.85 on Tuesday.	
 Japanese government bond futures fell, hurt by a slide in
U.S. Treasuries, with June 10-year futures down 0.29 point at
138.98, while the benchmark 10-year yield rose 2.5 basis point
to 1.295 percent.

 TORONTO, April 5 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar held near
three-year highs against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, resuming
an upward trend in the face of dipping U.S. oil prices.
 Brent crude jumped to a 2-1/2 year peak on ongoing conflict
in the oil-exporting regions of the Middle East and Africa,
while U.S. oil prices, which are a bigger influence on Canada's
currency, slipped. Still, the elevated prices for oil have been
a key support for the commodity-linked currency. [O/R]
 Other commodity prices, such as copper, were able to brush
off an interest rate hike in China, the country's second
increase this year.
 ""As long as they don't pull back significantly I think
you're going to continue to see strength in Canada. On top of
that, there's ongoing M&A activity,"" said Benjamin Reitzes,
economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 Canada has seen a slew of multibillion-dollar deals since
the start of the year, with two Toronto-listed miners currently
facing unsolicited takeover bids.
 Miners, particularly base metal producers, are expected to
drive Canadian merger and acquisition activity through 2011,
top bankers said on Tuesday at the Toronto leg of the Reuters
Global Mergers and Acquisitions Summit. [ID:nN05133056]
 The currency  closed at C$0.9639 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0375, up from Monday's North American finish of
C$0.9675 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0336, when it had snapped a
five-day rising streak.
 The Canadian dollar demonstrated resiliency compared with
its sister commodity currency, the Australian dollar, which
retreated from Monday's 29-year highs, partly on China's rate
move and as the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates
unchanged as widely expected. [ID:nL3E7F40J2]
 The Canadian dollar rose as high as C$0.9628 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0386, approaching Monday's three-year high at
C$0.9616 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0400.
 ""(China's rate hike) was a little bit earlier than the
market expected. Aussie sold off quite a bit, but Canada hasn't
followed suit. It's a little surprising,"" said Steve Butler,
director of foreign exchange trading at Scotia Capital.
 ""You'd think with the little bit of risk aversion that
we've seen overnight that Canada might be a little bit weaker
... I guess it goes to show the resiliency in the currency.""
 BONDS FALL, FOCUS ON CENTRAL BANKS
 Canadian government bond prices slid across the curve,
tracking their U.S. counterparts, with the focus on when North
American central banks might raise interest rates.
 A slew of contrasting comments from U.S. Federal Reserve
officials recently, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on
Monday, also had the markets parsing what it all means for the
U.S. central bank's policy outlook.
 The split over when to start tightening monetary conditions
again was also evident in the Federal Open Market Committee's
minutes for its March 15 policy-setting meeting.
[ID:nN04294041] [ID:nFEDAHEAD]
 By contrast, market participants are betting the Bank of
Canada is likely to start raising rates later this year, with a
September increase fully priced in, according to a Reuters
calculation of yields of overnight index swaps. 
 Market pricing shows the central bank is unlikely to raise
rates next week at its April 12 policy-setting, although
observers expect it will soon lay the groundwork in its
Monetary Policy Report for its resumption of rate hikes.
Canada's key rate has stood at 1 percent since September.
 ""We expect the Bank of Canada to be a little more hawkish
when they meet next week and then the MPR to (have) an upgraded
forecast,"" said Reitzes.
 The two-year bond  fell 9 Canadian cents to yield
1.862 percent, while the 10-year bond  was off 11
Canadian cents to yield 3.373 percent.

 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Prices of spot gold notched a
record high on Tuesday as a downgrade of Portugal's debt
stirred a bid for safety, while Brent crude ended above $122 a
barrel, at a 2-1/2 year high.
 The rise in oil prices on unrest in oil-exporting countries
overshadowed another interest rate hike from China and fed
inflation fears, which supported gold prices. Spot gold 
rose to a record high above $1,450 an ounce.
 ""What it shows is that big money continues to believe gold
will go higher ... because Bernanke wants to grow at any cost,""
said Axel Merk, portfolio manager of the $600 million Merk
Mutual Funds, referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's comments late on Monday suggesting he was committed
to completing a $600 billion stimulus program as scheduled in
June.
 ""The other reason for gold to go up is that there was a
downgrade in Portugal, so people realize there are still some
issues,"" Merk added.
 Corn futures also hit a record high, extending their
biggest rally in six months as traders feared supplies could
run out unless ranchers or ethanol makers cut back on
purchases.
 Corn futures  on the Chicago Board of Trade set a new
high of $7.70-3/4 per bushel after matching 2008's record high
on Monday. Corn has surged more than 15 percent in four days
since a U.S. government report showed unexpectedly low
inventories as of March 1. [ID:nLDE7300TD]
 The euro rose to an 11-month high against the yen and
neared a recent five-month peak against the dollar on
expectations of rising euro zone interest rates. The European
Central Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by a
quarter point when it meets on Thursday.

 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, April 5 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso hit its
strongest level in more than two years on Tuesday and Brazil's
real closed at its highest since August 2008 as the U.S. dollar
weakened broadly ahead of an expected EU interest rate hike.
 The euro neared a recent five-month peak against the dollar
on bets the European Central Bank was poised to raise rates on
Thursday.
 Meanwhile, minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's March
meeting showed differences between members but did not suggest
the Fed would move more quickly than expected to curb its easy
monetary policy. For details, see [ID:nN05140054]
 ""Dollar weakness is a very clear tendency, and the Fed is
not doing anything to change this. Meanwhile, Europe is seen
raising interest rates,"" said Ramon Cordova, a trader at
brokerage BASE in Monterrey. ""This should help the peso.""
 The Fed's ultra-easy monetary policies have supported Latin
American currencies by boosting the allure of the much higher
yields on the region's debt compared with U.S. Treasuries.
 Mexico's peso  firmed 0.2 percent to 11.8245 per
dollar, pulling back slightly after it marked a fresh intraday
high at 11.8055 per dollar, its strongest since October 2008.
 The region's currencies were supported by bets that China's
move to tighten borrowing costs would manage to tame growth
without undermining high prices for the region's commodities.
 China's central bank increased interest rates for the
fourth time since October as it seeks to curb inflation. But
commodity prices took the news in stride. [ID:nL3E7F51LX]
 China is Brazil's top trading partner and also one of
Chile's top customers for its copper.
 Brazil's currency  bid 0.25 percent firmer to 1.607
per dollar, its strongest close on the local spot market since
August 2008.
 Last week, the real broke a key level past 1.65 per dollar
that the government had been seen defending. Some analysts
think authorities could try to contain the real to around 1.60
per dollar.
 Doug Smith, head of Latin America research at Standard
Chartered in New York, said a gradual appreciation of the
Chinese currency could ease concerns in Brazil and Chile that
strong local currencies are undermining their manufacturers'
ability to compete with Chinese-made products.
 Chile's peso  bid up 0.32 percent at 473.10 per
dollar, trading at its strongest intraday levels in a month.
 Surprisingly strong growth data in Chile spurred
expectations of a hefty hike in the benchmark interest rate
next week. [ID:nN05100042]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro rose to an 11-month
high against the yen and neared a recent five-month peak
against the dollar on Tuesday on expectations of rising euro
zone interest rates that could keep the zone's common currency
supported in months ahead.
 Hedge fund adviser Medley Global Advisors said in a report
that the European Central Bank was poised to raise rates on
Thursday -- as expected -- and build in room to tighten policy
further. The report helped the euro recover from losses sparked
by a ratings downgrade of Portugal.
 Expectations of rising UK rates also got a lift after
strong British service sector data drove sterling higher. Rate
differentials have moved against the dollar in recent weeks
after comments by Federal Reserve officials signaled an
uncertain outlook for U.S. monetary policy.
 Going into Thursday's ECB meeting, the euro will likely
stay in its recent range, capped by resistance near $1.4280,
which marks the November high and a trendline drawn from the
July 2008 record high. Traders expect the euro eventually to
take out that resistance and rise toward $1.50.
 ""In the months ahead, we're likely to see more hawkishness
out of the ECB than the Fed,"" said Samarjit Shankar, managing
director of global FX strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston.
 In a sign of divergence over the outlook for U.S. rates,
the minutes of the Fed's March meeting released on Tuesday
showed some policymakers believed they would have to hold to an
easy monetary policy course beyond this year, while a few said
the central bank should move to tighter conditions before
year-end.
 The euro was up 0.9 percent at 120.63 yen after hitting an
11-month high of 120.69, according to Reuters data.
 Against the dollar, the euro was flat at $1.4221, just
below a session high of $1.4245 and near a five-month high of
$1.4268 touched on Monday.
 Expectations for a 25-basis-point rate hike by the ECB on
Thursday have supported the euro in recent weeks, with reported
bids from $1.4140 seen limiting losses.
 CHINA HIKES
 Moody's cut Portugal's sovereign debt rating by one notch,
saying debt problems on the euro zone periphery may prevent the
ECB from raising rates an anticipated three times this year.
 Credit Suisse in a note to clients said while peripheral
area uncertainty clearly remains, with Portugal likely needing
aid, ""Spain, the peripheral economy of real systemic
importance, has seen borrowing costs steadily decline this
year, almost completely decoupling from dynamics in Portugal.
 ""With systemic risks fading, ECB tightening is likely to
keep yield support for the euro elevated."" The firm expects the
euro to overshoot its three-month forecast of $1.44 and rise to
$1.50 in 12 months.
 The Australian dollar fell as low as $1.0289, retreating
further from its post-float high touched on Monday.
 China hiked interest rates by 25 basis points, the fourth
rate increase since October. Given strong trade links, the
Aussie can be the most sensitive currency to tightening moves
by China. The aussie last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.0330.

 The dollar rose 0.9 percent to 84.82 yen, having hit as

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Prices of spot gold notched a
record high on Tuesday as a downgrade of Portugal's debt
stirred a bid for safety, while Brent crude ended above $122 a
barrel, at a 2-1/2 year high.
 The rise in oil prices on unrest in oil-exporting countries
overshadowed another interest rate hike from China and fed
inflation fears, which supported gold prices. Spot gold 
rose to a record high above $1,450 an ounce.
 ""What it shows is that big money continues to believe gold
will go higher ... because Bernanke wants to grow at any cost,""
said Axel Merk, portfolio manager of the $600 million Merk
Mutual Funds, referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's comments late on Monday suggesting he was committed
to completing a $600 billion stimulus program as scheduled in
June.
 ""The other reason for gold to go up is that there was a
downgrade in Portugal, so people realize there are still some
issues,"" Merk added.
 Corn futures also hit a record high, extending their
biggest rally in six months as traders feared supplies could
run out unless ranchers or ethanol makers cut back on
purchases.
 Corn futures  on the Chicago Board of Trade set a new
high of $7.70-3/4 per bushel after matching 2008's record high
on Monday. Corn has surged more than 15 percent in four days
since a U.S. government report showed unexpectedly low
inventories as of March 1. [ID:nLDE7300TD]
 The euro rose to an 11-month high against the yen and
neared a recent five-month peak against the dollar on
expectations of rising euro zone interest rates. The European
Central Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by a
quarter point when it meets on Thursday.
 A large U.S. technology company merger helped keep a floor
under stocks, but indexes were dampened by profit-taking late
in the session.
 Texas Instruments Inc  said on Monday it would buy
rival National Semiconductor Corp  for $6.5 billion,
driving National Semiconductor's stock up more than 70 percent.

China, its fourth increase since October. China is viewed as a
main source of global growth. [ID:nL3E7F51LX]

 By Annika Breidthardt and Thorsten Severin
 BERLIN, April 5 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's Free
Democrat (FDP) coalition partner picked her 38-year-old health
minister as its next leader and deputy chancellor of Germany on
Tuesday after her foreign minister quit the party post.
 Philipp Roesler is to be formally elected at an FDP party
congress in May, succeeding the unpopular Guido Westerwelle, who
gave up the leadership on Sunday after state election defeats
and poor polls brought a long-simmering party revolt to a head.
 Westerwelle, who also quit his job as deputy chancellor, has
said he wants to remain foreign minister but some have voiced
doubts he will be able to cling onto that top cabinet post.
 He is widely blamed for the FDP's plunge in support to about
5 percent from a record 14.6 percent in the 2009 federal
election, which in turn has damaged Merkel's second term in
office. Polls show he is the least liked German politician.
 ""This is about winning back credibility for the FDP,"" said
Roesler as he announced his selection by the party leadership.
 Roesler, adopted as a baby in a Vietnamese orphanage by a
German couple, and trained as a doctor, ranked 15th out of 20 in
a Spiegel magazine popularity poll of politicians.
 That made him the second most-popular Free Democrat after
the justice minister, and put him four places ahead of
Westerwelle in 19th place and the FDP economy minister, Rainer
Bruederle, who came last.
 Critics have said Westerwelle, 49, has been arrogant, lacks
a common touch and failed to convince as foreign minister.
 
 STATE ELECTIONS LAST STRAW
 Roesler must prove he is up to the job of reasserting the
FDP's identity beyond just calling for tax cuts -- which seemed
to make the FDP a single-issue party under Westerwelle, who was
unable to deliver them because of the economic downturn.
 Germany's European partners will also be watching the tone
that Roesler sets on euro zone policy, after attempts by the FDP
to strengthen its appeal by taking a tough stance on bailouts.
 This has not helped the party in state elections this year.
It failed to gain a seat in two of them and just scraped into
the conservative stronghold of Baden-Wuerttemberg last month.
 The FDP's poor performance in this election contributed to
Merkel's Christian Democrats losing the state for the first time
in 58 years, undermining her leadership of the coalition.
 This humiliation, in which the conservatives' pro-nuclear
stance played a big role, fuelled a revolt against Westerwelle.
A prominent critic within the party has called Westerwelle a
""millstone round the neck"" of the FDP.
 When Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat/Greens coalition
lost key states in 2005 in similar fashion, he called a snap
election, and lost. But Merkel is not expected to do the same.
 She may be saved from having to reshuffle her cabinet again
just weeks after the popular defence minister, Karl-Theodor zu
Guttenberg, resigned in a plagiarism scandal.
Predictions that the FDP shake-up could cost Westerwelle and
65-year-old Bruederle their cabinet posts did not materialise
immediately as Roesler, initially seen as keen for the economy
ministry, will remain health minister for now.
 ""There is no need to change things,"" Roesler said.

 * Hopes for decision on Iraq NOC within ""weeks""
 
 (Adds detail)
 LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Iraq and Kurdistan are likely to
reach a long awaited agreement on revenues from crude oil
exports in the second half of 2011, an Iraqi government official
for energy policy said on Tuesday.
 Oil exports from the semi-autonomous region resumed in
February after a long halt, but the controversial issue of
payment has still not been resolved.
 ""The Kurd authorities requested it (the revenue deal) for
June or July, but I think we will miss it. I expect it later
this calendar year,"" said Adnan Al Janabi, chairman of Iraq's
Oil and Energy Committee, on the sidelines of an industry
conference.
 Kurdistan is now exporting around 80,000 barrels per day
(bpd), which could rise to 200,000 bpd by the end of 2011, he
added.
 Bagdhad and Erbil, Kurdistan's regional capital, have
wrangled over oil revenues from the region for years. The
Kurdistan Regional Government, which runs northern Iraq, has
signed around 40 production and exploration deals with
international oil companies.
 Current exports from the Kurdistan region are worth around
$10 million a day, based on Brent oil prices near $120 a barrel.
 But Al Janabi is confident differences can be overcome.
 ""They are big issues but ones that we think can be solved,
instead of having the stoppages of the last few years,"" he said.
 Al Janabi also said that he had submitted a new draft law to
government for the creation of an Iraqi national oil company.
This is seen as an important precursor for a hydrocarbon law to
establish a formal legal framework.
 ""I have already tabled the draft law of the NOC in Baghdad
... I hope we will get it in weeks,"" he said.

 * Euro little changed vs dollar after Medley report
 * Portugal downgrade still hurts the euro in early trade
 * China hikes rates; the aussie dented
 * Sterling rallies as data adds to rate hike chances
 (Updates prices, adds details)
 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro was little changed
against the dollar on Tuesday after a report suggesting the
European Central Bank would tighten rates this week and again
in the future helped the currency recover from losses.
 Hedge fund advisor Medley Global Advisors issued a report
on Tuesday saying the European Central Bank was poised to raise
interest rates at Thursday's meeting and then potentially
beyond, a source reading from the report told Reuters..
 The report helped the euro recover from earlier losses
knocked by a ratings downgrade of Portugal and a Chinese
interest rate hike.
 Higher euro zone interest rates will raise the
attractiveness of euro-denominated securities and increase
demand for the euros to buy them.
 Sterling gained after strong data boosted the chances of a
UK rate hike.
 ""Hints from ECB sources and an opinion from independent
hedge fund advisors Medley Global that the European Central
Bank is set to begin a gradual normalization of interest rates
drove the united currency 70 points higher just before the
London close,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at
FX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey.
 The euro was last up 0.04 percent at $1.4224, closer to the
session high of $1.4239 on Reuters data and still near a
five-month high touched on Monday. The euro was up 0.8 percent
against the yen at 120.50, an 11-month high.
 Despite Tuesday's gains, the euro is expected to stay stuck
in its recent range ahead of the ECB's policy meeting. Monday's
rally to a five-month high stalled ahead of resistance around
$1.4280. That coincides with November's high of $1.4283 and a
trendline drawn from the July 2008 record high.
 ""With the looming ECB decision and press conference the
euro has been well supported but is likely now entering a range
that will hold until Thursday,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""For new
highs to be reached from here, we will need to hear a fairly
hawkish ECB President Trichet.""
 Widespread expectations for a 25 basis point rate hike by
the ECB on Thursday continued to support the euro, with
reported bids from $1.4140 seen limiting losses.
 CHINA HURTS
 Earlier the euro was hurt by the decision by China to hike
interest rates 25 basis points, the fourth rate increase since
October and a decision that also dented higher-yielding
currencies like the Australian dollar..
 Another euro negative came as Moody's cut Portugal's
sovereign debt rating by one notch, saying debt problems on the
euro zone periphery may prevent the European Central Bank from
raising rates an anticipated three times this year.
 The Australian dollar traded down as low as $1.0288, taking
it further from its post float high touched on Monday. The
Australian dollar was floated in December 1983. Given
trade links, the Aussie can be the most sensitive to moves by
China to tighten monetary policy because Australian exports
could fall. The aussie last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.0337.

 An unexpected leap in UK services sector activity to a
13-month high buoyed the pound, which rose as much as 1 percent
versus the euro as the market moved closer toward pricing in a
UK rate hike in June.
 ""Sterling is the main mover after the PMI data was vastly
higher than expected, and there may be a little more potential
for UK rate expectations to be pulled up further,"" Lloyds'
Schmidt said.
 Sterling was last up 1 percent against the dollar at
$1.6283.
 Later on Tuesday, minutes of the Federal Reserve March 15
meeting will be scrutinized for hints on whether U.S.
policymakers may be edging toward a tighter monetary stance.
Some Fed officials have struck a hawkish tone recently, while
others have remained dovish.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.7 percent to 84.64 yen,
and at the session high matched the six-month peak set on
Friday, according to Reuters data. A 200-day moving average at
around 83.55 is now seen acting as support.

 * Belarussians buying more gold, diamonds, dollars - cbank
 * Bailout talks with Russia go on
 
 (Adds Russian cbank comment)
 MINSK, April 5 (Reuters) - President Alexander Lukashenko on
Tuesday blamed a run on the Belarussian rouble  on a spike
in car imports ahead of a customs duty increase.
 Belarus' central bank introduced restrictions on foreign
currency trading and allowed a de facto 10 percent devaluation
of the rouble last month after spending $1 billion -- a fifth of
its reserves -- on supporting the currency in January and
February. [ID:nLDE72U0HB]
 Belarus imported more cars in the first quarter of this year
than in the first two quarters of 2010, the customs office has
said without providing any figures. Import duties are due to
more than double in July.
 Economists, including those at the International Monetary
Fund, say Belarus' current account deficit reflects the weakness
of its Soviet-style command economy and have urged Minsk to
speed up structural reforms and devalue the rouble further.
 They also linked Belarus' growing trade gap to a sharp rise
in government lending and generous wage increases announced last
year in the run-up to a presidential election last December in
which Lukashenko secured a fourth term in office.
 However, Lukashenko said on Tuesday a jump in car imports
was to blame for the foreign exchange problems. Belarus will
raise import duties on cars significantly from July 1 under a
customs union deal with Russia and Kazakhstan.
 ""Of course, we have been weakened significantly by the car
rush,"" state news agency BelTA quoted him as saying.
 ""(But) we will withstand this, so let people buy the cars
that they want,"" Lukashenko said, adding that the situation
would improve within a few months.
 Belarussian officials have said they expect to secure about
$3 billion in loans from Russia and other ex-Soviet nations in
April or May.
 But Moscow has demanded to see a credible action plan and
analysts say talks over the loans may take longer than Minsk
expects.
 Russian central bank chairman Sergei Ignatyev, asked about
the conditions for extending a loan, told reporters on Tuesday:
 ""I cannot tell you that, everything is being discussed
now... We are holding consultations both with our Belarussian
colleagues and the Finance Ministry.""
 Unconvinced by repeated pledges of exchange rate stability,
Belarussians bought $500 million in foreign currency last month,
up from about $75 million in the two previous months.
 They also bought 470 kilograms of gold from the central bank
in March compared with 209 kilograms in January-February and 184
diamonds compared with 263 sold by the bank in the previous two
months, the central bank said on Tuesday.

 * US service sector slips from five-year high
 * China hikes rates, ECB expected to follow suit
 * India services PMI slips slightly from 7-month high
 By Andy Bruce and Kristina Cooke
 LONDON/NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Service industries
powered ahead in Britain and the euro zone in March but slowed
in the United States, surveys showed on Tuesday, highlighting
the different challenges faced by policymakers.
 The U.S. Institute for Supply Management's index of
non-manufacturing activity slipped to 57.3 in March from
February's five-year high of 59.7, falling short of market
expectations.
 ""We're looking at this as a pause,"" said Paul Radeke, vice
president at KDV Wealth Management. A number of U.S. economists
have recently trimmed their first-quarter growth estimates.
 Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) in Britain and the euro
zone told a different story, suggesting economic growth in the
first quarter could surpass economists' expectations.
 PMIs measure business activity at thousands of companies,
 The British services PMI jumped unexpectedly in March to
its highest level in over a year. The equivalent euro zone
survey showed service sector companies enjoying their fastest
upturn since August 2007.
 The British and European surveys showed prices paid by
companies for raw materials and goods soared again in March.
They also revealed a yawning gap between input and output
prices as businesses felt unable to pass on soaring costs to
consumers already facing austerity measures.
""The difference between the input price and output prices
does imply that margins are getting squeezed,"" said Philip
Shaw, chief economist at Investec.
 Countries like China and India have been battling high
inflation for the past two years. The People's Bank of China
raised its deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points on
Tuesday, for the fourth time since October, in an ongoing
battle to rein in inflation.
 The European Central Bank is tipped to follow suit and
raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point from a
record low 1.0 percent on Thursday. It would be the first among
the world's big four central banks -- the U.S. Federal Reserve,
the Bank of Japan, the ECB and Bank of England -- to begin
raising benchmark interest rates.
 By contrast, on Monday, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke signaled
the U.S. central bank is in no hurry to reverse course.
 Bernanke said a recent increase in U.S. inflation is likely
to be transitory, suggesting he is committed to completing a
$600 billion stimulus program scheduled to end in June.
 Cost pressures in the U.S. dipped slightly in March,
according to the ISM services report's prices component which
slowed to 72.1 from 73.3 in March. The employment component
slowed to 53.7 from 55.6.
 BRITISH SURGE
 In Britain, the Markit/CIPS services PMI surged to a
13-month high of 57.1 in March from 52.6 in February, beating
even the most optimistic forecast and remaining comfortably
above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction.
 ""It's extraordinarily strong, and it's puzzling. In some
ways you can argue that maybe last month's print was on the
soft side, though it was in line with the autumn,"" said Ross
Walker, economist at RBS.
 Survey compiler Markit said the data pointed to a 0.8
percent quarterly expansion for the economy as a whole in the
first three months of 2011, compared with the latest consensus
expectations for 0.7 percent. [ECILT/GB]

 The euro zone services PMI rose from 56.8 in February to

component leapt above 60 for the first time since the oil price
boom of 2008. Brent crude oil is trading at just over $120 a
barrel, near a 2-1/2 year high.
 While there are few signs in Europe of higher food and
energy costs fueling broader inflation, the Indian PMI showed
booming wage costs driving input prices there much higher.
 The HSBC Indian PMI slipped to 58.8 in March from a
seven-month high of 60.2 in February, showing a fast-growing
services sector struggling to keep up with rampant inflation.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Spot gold notched a record
high on Tuesday as a downgrade of Portugal's debt stirred a bid
for safety, while on Wall Street a large U.S. technology
company merger helped drive small gains.
 The euro reversed losses to turn positive against the
dollar after talk of a hawkish U.S. think-tank report on
European Central Bank policy. The ECB is widely expected to
raise interest rates by a quarter point when it meets on
Thursday.
 A rise in crude oil prices to 2-1/2 highs on unrest in
oil-exporting countries fed inflation fears and supported the
price of gold. Spot gold  rose to a record high above
$1,450 an ounce.
 Wall Street shares crept higher after Texas Instruments
 said it would buy rival National Semiconductor Corp
 for $6.5 billion, driving National Semiconductor's
stock up more than 70 percent.
 The deal offset the impact of an interest rate hike by
China, its fourth increase since October.[ID:nL3E7F51LX]
 ""These kinds of deals show that even with the rate hike and
the ISM number, prices are still extremely attractive,"" said
Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Burns Advisory Group
in Oklahoma City. ""That's why the market is holding steady
despite some bad news.""
 The Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday reported
that growth in the U.S. services sector slowed in March.
 Rating agency Moody's cut Portugal's sovereign debt by one
notch, saying the incoming government would urgently need to
seek financial aid from the European Union. Portuguese bond
yields rose to euro lifetime highs. [ID:nL3E7F50X6]
 ""Even though Moody's still rates the sovereign two notches
higher than Standard & Poor's, the downgrade is another blow to
sentiment,"" said Gavan Nolan, an analyst at data monitor
Markit.
 Portugal's lending banks told the central bank on Monday
that the country urgently needs a bridge loan and banks have
virtually no more capacity to buy government debt, sources
said. [ID:nLSB001083]
 Yields on Portugal's 10-year government bonds 
rose as high as 9.033 percent, while Portuguese stocks <.PSI20>
slumped 1 percent. The Portuguese market fared worse than the
broader FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which provisionally
closed up 0.2 percent.
 It was the highest close for European shares in almost four
weeks, with energy shares rising with oil prices.
 Credit default swaps implied a 41 percent probability of a
Portuguese default within five years, compared with 33 percent
at the end of February, data provider CMA said.

 Brent crude  prices topped $122 a barrel, recouping
losses as worries about supply from oil-producing countries in
Africa and the Middle East overshadowed China's rate hike.
Brent futures were up $1.47 at $122.51 a barrel, while U.S.
crude futures  were flat around $108.46.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said late on Monday
that the recent spike in U.S. inflation was unlikely to
persist.
 But sustained higher oil prices could pose a serious threat
to the global economic recovery and dampen risk appetite.

 Incumbent: Muhammad Al-Jasser
 Term: Since February 2009
 
 Key Facts:
 -- Jasser replaced Hamad al-Sayari as governor of the Saudi
Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) in February 2009 after almost 15
years as vice governor.
 -- He began his career at the Saudi finance ministry in 1981
and later became executive director for Saudi Arabia at the
International Monetary Fund, a post he held until 1995. He
helped negotiate Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade
Organization in 2005.
 -- Jasser also chairs state-controlled Saudi Telecom, the
kingdom's biggest telecom firm by market value, and sits on the
boards of several other Saudi and regional institutions
including the Islamic Development Bank and Arab Monetary Fund.
SAMA ranks as the fourth biggest central bank in terms of
reserves, after China, Japan and Russia.
 -- After joining SAMA in 1995, Jasser helped devise the
central bank's response to a decade-long oil price rally, an
onslaught of currency speculation in 2007 and, most recently, an
oil price slump and credit crisis. One of his main actions
during the recent financial crisis was to more than double the
central bank's gold reserves.
 -- Jasser stood steadfastly by the dollar as a peg for the
Saudi riyal -- a policy the kingdom has maintained since 1986 --
saying at the height of speculation in 2008 that the peg served
Saudi interests. The kingdom is a major holder of dollar assets
and a top U.S. ally in the region.
 -- Jasser earned a B.A. in Economics from San Diego State
University in 1979 and an M.A. in Economics from the University
of California in 1981. In 1986, he completed his doctorate in
Economics from the University of California.

post-Soviet history -- in June 2009. There are no limits as to
how many four-year terms the central bank governor may serve,
though Ignatyev's current stint officially ends in 2013.
 -- Ignatyev has overseen the inflation battle of the oil
boom years and the scrapping of capital controls.
 -- He also led the central bank during the 2008-2009 crisis,
when the regulator staged a gradual devaluation of the ruble.
The policy was subsequently judged to be successful, as it
managed to avoid panic and mass flight from the ruble seen
during the previous crisis, in 1998.
 -- Under Ignatyev, the central bank has been stepping up its
communication and becoming more open, as it gradually increases
the importance of interest rates and moves toward targeting
inflation rather than the exchange rate.
 -- Ignatyev took his first high-ranking job at the economy
and finance ministry under the pro-reform administration of
Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar when President Boris Yeltsin was in
power.
 -- The grey-haired, bespectacled Ignatyev is reticent with
the press, almost never giving interviews and restricting
contact to occasional news conferences. Colleagues have
characterized him as a very careful man, who takes a balanced
approach and tends to avoid controversial decisions.
 -- Ignatyev, an author of more than 20 academic papers and
holder of a PhD in economics, hails from current Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin's home town of St Petersburg and portrays himself
as a non-party affiliated moderate reformer.
 -- Russia's central bank is officially independent, although
analysts have questioned the scope of the government's influence
on policy. The central bank famously embarked on a campaign of
interest rate cuts in April 2009, just a day after Putin
publicly told Ignatyev rate cuts were possible given lower
inflation.
 -- Ignatyev, a keen smoker, earned 19.5 million rubles
($645,900) in 2009, co-owns a flat with his wife and has the use
of a central bank country house, according to official data.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2011 11:56AM ET</span>",EU to further tighten radiation limits on Japan food," BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Union said it
will further reinforce its radiation controls on imports of food
and animal feed from Japan from next week, in response to the
crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.
 The announcement came the day after Japanese Prime Minister
Naoto Kan asked Europe for a ""calm, logical response"" to the
issue of Japanese food imports, and two weeks after the
27-nation bloc tightened its limits on such goods.
 ""The Commission believes it would be correct to amend the
present levels in force since March 25 as an additional
safeguard measure,"" the President of the bloc's executive, Jose
Manuel Barroso, told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg on Tuesday.
 Barroso said the decision -- which must be approved by EU
governments on Friday -- was taken after Japan introduced
stricter requirements on food products for domestic consumption
and export, and was a purely precautionary measure.
 ""I should like to underline here that all the checks
carried out up to now by member states... demonstrate negligible
levels of radioactivity which are significantly below current
Japanese and European standards,"" he said.
 The tougher EU limits on Japanese imports will remain in
place until the bloc has carried out assessments of the current
permitted levels of radiation in food imports around the world,
which Barroso said would be completed by the end of June.
 Any new EU levels will have to be enforced by the bloc's 27
member states individually. Germany, Britain and France have
started extra checks on Japanese food imports such as soy sauce
and shellfish to ensure they are free from radioactivity.

 Incumbent: Alan Bollard
 Term: Reappointed for a second five-year term in 2007.
 
 Key Facts:
 -- An economic pragmatist, Bollard has spent virtually all
his career in the civil service or private research groups. His
appointment in 2002, from being head of the Treasury department,
was a surprise given his lack of banking or private sector
experience.
 -- Bollard was seen as likely to be less doctrinaire than
his predecessor, Don Brash, who had a reputation as a strong
anti-inflation fighter. Bollard held the RBNZ's cash rate steady
for the first few reviews at a time when many analysts were
clamoring for tighter policy, earning him the nickname of Dr.
No.
 -- Bollard caused something of a stir in February 2010 when
he said one of the government's favored political ambitions --
to catch up to Australia's economic wealth and income levels --
was not obtainable. He said that New Zealand, instead, should
look at how it could benefit from Australia's success.
 -- As head of Treasury between 1998 and 2002 he was
acknowledged as making the department a more credible and
neutral policy advisor.
 -- Prior to his Treasury position, he headed the Commerce
Commission, the main competition and consumer watchdog 1994 to
1998, and was director of the New Zealand Institute of Economic
Research, an independent think tank, from 1987 to 1994. He has
also worked in Europe and the United States. He has a PhD in
economics from the University of Auckland.
 -- He maintains a low profile, rarely giving speeches or

but has a dry sense of humor and once said he aims to make two
improvements in the organization he heads -- the standard of the
coffee and the Christmas cards.
 -- Alongside writing several economic texts and papers,
Bollard has also devised a computer game where the player is a
Minister of Finance. He also helped to restore an hydraulic

 * Kenya accounts for 35 percent of sub Saharan Africa sales

 By Beatrice Gachenge
 NAIROBI, April 5 (Reuters) - General Motors East Africa
(GMEA), Kenya's top vehicle assembler, expects sales to grow by
50 percent this year driven by demand for public transport
vehicles in the country and sub Saharan Africa.
 Rita Kavashe, who took over as chief executive officer this
month from Bill Lay, told Reuters on Tuesday her priority is to
grow the bus segment and take advantage of a new policy in east
Africa's biggest economy, which last year said it would phase
out 14-seater vans used in public transport in favour of buses.
 ""The public service vehicle industry is going to be our key
success factor because of the opportunity to upgrade to higher
occupancy buses and we are going to ride on that,"" said Kavashe
in an interview, shortly after being unveiled in her new role.
 GMEA, the Kenyan unit of New York-listed General Motors Co.
with brands that include Isuzu, Chevrolet and Opel, said it
plans to sell 12,000 vehicles in sub Saharan Africa, compared
with up about 8,000 last year.
 The group's sub Saharan African market comprises of 40
countries of which Kenya accounted for 35 percent of the
vehicles sales in the region, while Angola stood at 25 percent,
followed by Nigeria at 9 percent in 2010.
 The bus business is expected to grow to 1,300 units by 2012
up from the current 700 in east and southern Africa, targeting
more sales in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique.
 GM's sub-Saharan region extends to over 40 countries with
its biggest markets located in South Africa, Angola, Nigeria,
Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Senegal.
 The focus in sub-Saharan Africa is in line with the group's
objective to grow in the world's emerging markets.
 Kavashe, who has worked at GM East Africa for 15 years in
all aspects of the company's operations, said the company is
lobbying governments in the east African region to reform public
transport and help ease traffic congestion in the cities.
 ""We are looking at growing each of the 40 markets in sub
Sahara Africa at a minimum of 10 percent by 2012 and up to 16
percent by 2017,"" said Kavashe, who was GM's Export Manager
based in South Africa prior to taking up her new role.
 In Kenya, Kavashe plans to grow the firm's market share from
24 percent to 26 percent in the next five years, but was
cautious of setting a bigger target citing stiff competition.
 Local media said Foton Motor, a Chinese vehicle
manufacturer, is poised to set up a plant in Kenya this year,
while the vibrant second hand car market continues to mount
pressure on GMEA.
 Kenya's CMC Holdings, a dealer for brands such as Land
Rover, Volkswagen and Mazda, is a key competitor for GMEA in the
public transport segment.
 ""Competition worries me, so I have to up the game in terms
of services,"" said Kavashe. 
 An aggressive Japanese Yen continues to take a toll on GMEA
which sources vehicles such as Isuzu from in the Asian country.
 Following last month's earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the
vehicle manufacturer said it had inventory for the next one
month.
 ""The Japanese Yen has been strengthening a lot and we have
to pass some of that cost to the customer, and look for
strategic ways of cutting costs so that the full impact of the
currency fluctuation is not passed to the end user,"" she said.

 By Olga Popova
 MOSCOW, April 5 (Reuters) - The charge of Russian companies
looking to London to go public picked up pace on Tuesday, as
mid-size bank Nomos confirmed plans to float 20 percent of its
stock and several more issuers eyed talks with investors.
 The easing of market volatility, which spiked last month on
fears of a nuclear crisis in Japan and unrest in the Arab world,
has sparked renewed interest in listings, with Russian firms
leading the charge.
 Nomos kicking off the roadshow for its $700 million listing
means four Russian issuers are now touring investors, seeking to
raise a combined total of just over $3 billion -- more than half
the $5.5 billion raised by Russian firms in the whole of 2010.
 The company, Russia's eighth biggest bank, was the last of
the quartet to announce a price range for its share sale.
 The order book on sugar and pork group Rusagro's $300
million listing is already fully subscribed ahead of a pricing
on Friday, a source close to the deal said.
 Mobile phone retailer Euroset is seeking up to $1.52 billion
it said on April 1, while real estate developer Etalon began
roadshows for an up to $650 million float on Monday.
 Nomos, whose offering will close with pricing on April 19,
said it would place ordinary shares at $32 to $37, or $16.0 to
$18.5 per global depositary receipt (GDR), in London and Moscow.
 The initial public offering (IPO) will largely comprise the
sale of existing shares by 18.7 percent shareholder Roman
Korbacka, as well as the placing of new shares worth around 5.5
billion roubles ($195 million).
 The bank said the offering would value it at $2.8 billion to
$3.2 billion, while a source close to the deal said previous
market estimates of $700 million remained the fund-raising
target.
 SECOND BITE
 A wave of other firms joining the queue to list includes
state holding company Russian Helicopters, which will start
pre-marketing for a possible $500 million IPO next week, a
source close to the deal told Reuters.
 Rostelecom, Russia's state-run telecoms group, will also
list up to 25 percent of its shares in London by the end of the
year, but will not raise new capital.
 Early analyst estimates for 2011 Russian IPO fundraising
were as high as $30 billion, but expectations were tempered in
February when three candidates postponed their plans and a
fourth -- pumps manufacturer Hydraulic -- had to drastically cut
the size of its offering.
 With confidence boosted by current market activity, one of
the three who backed away, steel pipes manufacturer ChelPipe, is
preparing a fresh round of talks with overseas investors as it
considers a second bite at the cherry, three financial market
sources said.
 Investors have been reluctant to invest in IPOs that
represent a simple cashing in for owners, and many of the new
wave have pledged to issue new shares alongside existing stock.
 While Nomos co-owner Korbacka is aiming to sell down his
entire stake, the bank could gain another billionaire tycoon
shareholder in Alexander Mamut, the co-founder and owner of
fellow IPO candidate Euroset.
 Mamut, who is seeking up to $1.35 billion from the Euroset
IPO, may buy around $100 million of Nomos stock, a source close
to the deal said.
 Nomos, whose offering is being run by Credit Suisse,
Deutsche Bank and VTB Capital, plans to use the proceeds of its
float to strengthen its capital position and grow its loan
portfolio.
 Credit Suisse has won mandates for all four of the current
IPO hopefuls, while VTB Capital is on three of the deals.

took on a more dovish mantle. He presided over the slashing of
British interest rates to a record low 0.5 percent in March 2009
and the launch of the country's unprecedented quantitative
easing programme.
 -- Unusually for a central bank governor, King has several
times found himself in a minority on the nine-member Monetary

a majority decision to cut interest rates, and in June 2007 when
he voted to raise interest rates. In August 2009 he was outvoted
with a dovish stance when he argued for a greater expansion of
the BoE's quantitative easing program than the majority.
 -- King gained a first class degree in economics from King's
College, Cambridge and was a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard. After
graduation he taught at Birmingham University and spent a year
as a visiting professor at MIT, where he worked next door to Ben
Bernanke, who was an assistant professor.
 -- King has welcomed the coalition government's decision to
give the Bank greater regulatory powers. In his annual ""Mansion
House"" speech in June 2009, King appeared to criticize the then
Labour government for widening the Bank's regulation remit

 * Nuclear crisis far from under control
 * Fisherman angry over contaminated water being pumped into
sea
 * Vast sea to dilute radioactive water - expert
(Updates with cumulative radiation concerns, angry fishermen)	
 By Shinichi Saoshiro and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 6 (Reuters) - Japan stopped highly radioactive
water leaking into the sea on Wednesday from a crippled nuclear
plant and acknowledged it could have given more information to
neighbouring countries about contamination in the ocean.	
 Despite the breakthrough in plugging the leak at the
Fukushima Daiichi power plant, engineers need to pump 11.5
million litres (11,500 tonnes) of contaminated water back into
the ocean because they have run out of storage space at the
facility. The water was used to cool over-heated fuel rods.	
 Nuclear experts said the damaged reactors were far from
being under control almost a month after they were hit by a
massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11.	
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) said it
had stemmed the leak using liquid glass at one of the plants six
reactors.	
 ""The leaks were slowed yesterday after we injected a mixture
of liquid glass and a hardening agent and it has now stopped,"" a
TEPCO spokesman told Reuters.	
 Engineers had been struggling to stop leaks from reactor No.
2, even using sawdust and newspapers.	
 Neighbours South Korea and China are getting concerned about
the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, and
the radioactive water being pumped into the sea, newspapers
reported.	
 ""We are instructing the trade and foreign ministries to work
better together so that detailed explanations are supplied
especially to neighbouring countries,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary
Yukio Edano told a news conference.	
 
 Experts insisted the low-level radioactive water to be
pumped into the ocean posed no health hazard to people.	
 ""The original amount of radioactivity is very low, and when
you dilute this with a huge body of water, the final levels will
be even lower than legal limits,"" said Pradip Deb, senior
lecturer in Medical Radiations at the School of Medical
Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University.	
 The government is preparing to revise guidelines for legal
radiation levels, designed for brief exposure to high levels of
radiation in emergencies and not cumulative absorption, for
people living near the damaged plant. 
 Workers are struggling to restart cooling pumps -- which
recycle the water -- in four damaged reactors.	
 Until those are fixed, they must pump in water to prevent
overheating and meltdowns, but have run out of storage capacity
for the seawater when it becomes contaminated.	
 Radioactive iodine detected in the sea has been recorded at
4,800 times the legal limit, but has since fallen to about 600
times the limit. The water remaining in the reactors has
radiation five million times legal limits.	
 ""What they are going to have to release is likely
to be highly radioactive. The situation could politically be
very ugly in a week,"" said Murray Jennex at San Diego State
University, who specialises in nuclear containment.	
 Japan's fishermen, who are part of the politically powerful
agriculatural lobby, made it clear they were not assuaged by
assurances that ocean radioactivity levels were low and safe.	
 ""(The release of radioactive water into the sea) is
unforgivable in any circumstance,"" Ikuhiro Hattori, chairman of
the Japan Fisheries Cooperatives, told NHK state television.	
 ""From now on, our fishermen will never cooperate with or
accept nuclear power generation. I would like them to stop even
those reactors that are now in operation right away.""	
 
 COOLING REACTORS KEY	
 Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War Two after
the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami left nearly 28,000
people dead or missing and thousands homeless, and rocked the
world's third-largest economy.	
 It will likely take months to finally cool down the reactors
and years to dismantle those that have been damaged. TEPCO has
said it will decommission four of the six reactors.	
 An opposition lawmaker from Fukushima told
reporters antipathy in the area would make it difficult to
resume operations at the nearby Fukushima Daini plant, where
operations have been halted since March 11.	
 The two Fukushima plants together provide four percent of
Japan's electric power. [ID:nTKB007431]	
 ""Nuclear power plants can run only with local consent. I see
it as being quite difficult to resume operations,"" said
Masayoshi Yoshino of the Liberal Democratic Party.	
 Concerned over a possible buildup of hydrogen gas in reactor
No. 1, engineers will inject nitrogen gas into the reactor on
Wednesday night to prevent an explosion, TEPCO said.	
 Hydrogen explosions ripped through reactors 1 and 3 early in
the crisis, spreading high levels of radiation into the air.	
 The key to bringing the reactors under control is the extent
of damage to the plant's cooling system, said analysts.	
 In a sign the cooling systems may be severely damaged, the
Sankei newspaper reported that the government and TEPCO were
considering building new cooling systems for three reactors to
operate from outside the reactor buildings.	
 ""To put the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in perspective,
Chernobyl involved a single operating reactor core,"" said Kevin
Kamps from Beyond Nuclear, a U.S. radioactive waste watchdog.	
 ""Fukushima Daiichi now involves three reactors in various
stages of meltdown and containment breach, and multiple (spent
fuel storage) pools at risk of fire,"" said Kamps.	
 Kamps said the spent fuel rod pools, which are on the roof
of the damaged reactors, alone have more irradiated nuclear fuel
than that which exploded and burned at Chernobyl.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - An interest rate hike in
China and a downgrade of Portugal's debt pushed the euro
further away from a five-month peak against the dollar on
Tuesday, but a large technology company merger helped put a
floor in U.S. stocks.
 Wall Street shares crept higher after Texas Instruments
 said it would buy rival National Semiconductor Corp
 $6.5 billion. Oil prices also shrugged off the China
rate hike, holding near 2-1/2-year highs.
 China, viewed as a main source of global growth, lifted
interest rates for the fourth time since October to cool
inflation. For details, see [ID:nL3E7F51LX]
 ""The market is getting used to the rate hikes in China, and
there is less concern it will derail global growth,"" said
Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in
Boston of the U.S. stock market.
 ""On the plus side there's this M&A deal in the tech space,""
he said. ""Companies are beginning to spend their cash on merger
deals and also on hiring. They're feeling confident enough to
spend on growth initiatives.""
 Rating agency Moody's cut Portugal's sovereign debt by one
notch, saying the incoming government would urgently need to
seek financial aid from the European Union. Portuguese bond
yields rose to euro lifetime highs. [ID:nL3E7F50X6]
 ""Even though Moody's still rates the sovereign two notches
higher than Standard & Poor's, the downgrade is another blow to
sentiment,"" said Gavan Nolan, an analyst at data monitor
Markit.
 There were also reports that Portuguese banks may be
threatening to stop buying government bonds to pressure Lisbon
into seeking a bailout, following the same path as Greece and
Ireland. [ID:nLDE7340J4]
 Yields on Portugal's 10-year government bonds 
rose as high as 9.033 percent, while Portuguese stocks <.PSI20>
fell 0.7 percent. The Portuguese market fared worse than the
broader FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which gained 0.2
percent.
 Credit default swaps implied a 41 percent probability of a
Portuguese default within five years, compared with 33 percent
at the end of February, data provider CMA said.
[ID:nLDE7341H4]
 The euro  fell against the dollar for the second day
but trimmed losses after talk of a hawkish U.S. think-tank
report on European Central Bank monetary policy. The euro was
last trading at $1.4194, down 0.2 percent on the day, according
to Reuters data.
 The single currency was also supported by expectations the
European Central Bank when it meets on Thursday will raise
rates by 25 basis points from a record low of 1 percent to tame
inflationary pressures.

 Global stocks snapped a five-day winning streak with the

Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 10.66 points, or 0.38
percent, to 2,799.85.
 Brent crude  prices topped $122 a barrel, recouping
losses as worries about supply from oil-producing countries in
Africa and the Middle East overshadowed China's rate hike.
Brent futures were up 98 cents at $122.05 a barrel, while U.S.
crude futures  were down 22 cents at $108.25.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said late on Monday
that the recent spike in U.S. inflation was unlikely to
persist.
 But sustained higher oil prices could pose a serious threat
to the global economic recovery and dampen risk appetite.
Investors were awaiting the release of minutes from the latest
rate-setting committee meeting of the Fed later in the
afternoon.
 ""The recent rally in oil has had virtually no impact on
equities. It was just over a month ago where equities markets
were nervous about the impact of oil prices on the economy,""
Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note.
 ""The difference this time is that the rise has likely been
due to decent growth rather than immediate geopolitical
concerns. Nevertheless one would expect the creeping price of
oil to start to get more attention given the recent rally.""

 * Danes may raise CD rate more than lending rate - analysts
 * Extra CD rate rise would be step to rate normalisation
 
 COPENHAGEN, April 5 (Reuters) - Denmark's central bank will
move in lock-step with the European Central Bank if the latter
raises base interest rates on Thursday, but it might increase a
secondary Danish rate more sharply, analysts said.
 If, as widely expected, the ECB raised interest rates by 25
basis points on Thursday from a record low 1.0 percent,
Denmark's Nationalbank would in turn hike its lending rate by 25
bps from 1.05 percent, where it has been since January 2010.
 Economists said that was a ""done deal"" because Denmark would
want to keep the official rate spread to the euro zone steady.
 The only uncertainty was whether the Danish bank would opt
for an extra increase in its certificates of deposit (CD) rate.
 ""They might hike (the CD rate) by an additional 5 or 10
basis points as part of the (monetary) normalisation in the
market,"" Danske Bank chief forex analyst Arne Lohmann Rasmussen
said.
 The CD rate is a secondary rate, which nonetheless has
played a role in Danish monetary policy during the financial
crisis as the bank began differentiating between the lending
rate and the CD rate in June 2009. Before then, they were equal.
 The Danish central bank, which aims via its monetary policy
to keep the crown currency steady within a narrow band against
the euro, subsequently cut the CD rate more steeply than the
lending rate because of the strong crown.
 In October 2010, the Danish bank independently raised the CD
rate twice by 10 bps, to 0.60 percent from an all-time low 0.50
percent and then to 0.70 percent, after Danish short-term market
interest rates fell below corresponding European rates.
 That negative rate spread had caused the Danish crown to
weaken, and the bank moved to curb that weakening with an early
tightening move in the CD rate while leaving the gap to the euro
zone official rate steady at 5 bps.
 Danske Bank's Rasmussen predicted the Danish central bank
would raise its lending rate by 25 bps ""to follow the ECB, and
then raise its CD rate by an extra 5 to 10 basis points.""
 
 NORMALISATION OF RATES
 The CD rate was earlier lowered by more than the lending
rate when Eonia rates started to trade below Danish short-term
market rates.
 ""Now, as we see a certain pressure on Eonia  rates
going forward, it is time for the central bank to normalise this
CD rate,"" Rasmussen said. ""They might start doing that now.""
 But Nordea Markets senior analyst Troels Theill Eriksen said
his ""main scenario"" was that the Danish central bank would raise
the lending rate and CD rate by the same amount.
 While it could not be ruled out that the bank would raise
the CD rate by more , ""looking at interest rate spreads and the
crown, we do not see any real sign that they would do that.""
 ""When the rate spreads were negative and the crown was weak,
I would have seen a higher possibility for that,"" Eriksen said.
""They do not need to do that now, and the currency reserves are
very high, so they are bolstered.""
 The bank on Monday said its foreign currency reserves
climbed to a record high 453.9 billion Danish crowns ($86.34
billion) in March when it intervened in the forex market with
only a small amount - 400 million - to support the crown.
 Rasmussen said that the only potential market impact would
be on the very front end of the money market curve, and that
would be related to whether the bank raises the CD rate by the
same amount as the lending rate or by more.
 ""We don't expect any impact on the currency,"" he said.
 The Nationalbank can change rates at any time and does not
say when its policymaking board of governors meets, though its
prime time for changing rates is Thursdays at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT).

(Adds Wall Street open, updates prices)
 By Leah Schnurr and Dominic Lau
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell further
from a five-month peak against the dollar on Tuesday as
Portugal moved closer to a possible debt bailout and after a
rate hike by China, which also pressured global stocks.
 Wall Street opened modestly lower. China, which is viewed
as a main source of global growth, hiked interest rates for the
fourth time since October to cool inflation. For details, see
[ID:nL3E7F51LX]
 Brent crude  prices topped $121 a barrel, recouping
earlier losses as worries about supply from oil-producing
countries in Africa and the Middle East overshadowed China's
rate hike. Brent futures were up 51 cents at $121.57 a barrel,
while U.S. crude futures  were down 57 cents at $107.90.
 Rating agency Moody's cut Portugal's sovereign debt by one
notch, saying it believed the incoming government would
urgently need to seek financial aid from the European Union.
Portuguese bond yields rose to euro lifetime highs on
[ID:nL3E7F50X6]
 ""Even though Moody's still rates the sovereign two notches
higher than Standard & Poor's, the downgrade is another blow to
sentiment,"" said Gavan Nolan, an analyst at data monitor
Markit.
 There were also reports that Portuguese banks may be
threatening to stop buying government bonds to pressure Lisbon
into seeking a bailout, following the same path as Greece and
Ireland. [ID:nLDE7340J4]
 Yields on Portugal's 10-year government bonds 
rose as high as 9.033 percent, while Portuguese stocks <.PSI20>
fell 0.7 percent. The Portuguese market fared worse than the
broader FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which was off 0.2
percent.
 Credit default swaps implied a 41 percent probability of a
Portuguese default within five years, compared with 33 percent
at the end of February, data provider CMA said.
[ID:nLDE7341H4]
 The euro fell against the dollar for the second day in a
row and was down 0.3 percent at $1.4183 .
 The single currency was supported, however, by expectations
the European Central Bank when it meets on Thurssday will raise
rates by 25 basis points from a record low of 1 percent to tame
inflationary pressures. 
 CHINA HIKE NOT SEEN TOO WORRISOME
 Global stocks snapped a five-day winning streak with the
MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> off 0.4 percent
after hitting six-week highs in the previous session. On Wall
Street, the broad S&P 500 opened slightly lower.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 17.59
points, or 0.14 percent, to 12,382.44. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> eased 0.90 points, or 0.07 percent, to
1,331.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 1.87 points,
or 0.07 percent, to 2,791.06.
 ""The market is getting used to the rate hikes in China and
there is less concern it will derail global growth,"" said ""
Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in
Boston.
 ""On the plus side there's this M&A deal in the tech space,""
he said. ""Companies are beginning to spend their cash on merger
deals and also on hiring, they're feeling confident enough to
spend on growth initiatives.""

 OIL IMPACT
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said late Monday that
the recent spike in U.S. inflation was unlikely to persist.
 But sustained higher oil prices could pose a serious threat
to the global economic recovery and dampen risk appetite.
 ""The recent rally in oil has had virtually no impact on
equities. It was just over a month ago where equities markets
were nervous about the impact of oil prices on the economy,""
Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note.
 ""The difference this time is that the rise has likely been
due to decent growth rather than immediate geopolitical
concerns. Nevertheless one would expect the creeping price of
oil to start to get more attention given the recent rally.""
 Metal prices dipped modestly after China's rate rise was
overshadowed by other factors ranging from Mideast unrest to a
rise in copper inventories. Silver dipped after rising to its
highest since early 1980 at $38.77 an ounce. [ID:nLDE73414M]

(In U.S. dollars)
 OTTAWA, April 5 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada sold $124
million worth of Japanese yen last month as part of a concerted
G7 intervention in the currency market to stabilize the
Japanese currency following Japan's earthquake and tsunami.
 The Department of Finance revealed the largely symbolic
amount of the transaction by the Bank of Canada in its monthly
report on official international reserves on Tuesday.
 Canada joined the Group of Seven industrial nations on
March 18 in their first foreign exchange intervention in a
decade. The action helped the yen ease from extraordinary high
levels that were seen to be hindering Japan's efforts to
recover from its natural disaster and unfolding nuclear
crisis.
 Japan announced March 31 that it conducted a total of 692.5
billion yen ($8.4 billion) in the intervention. The government
data did not indicate which currency the Bank of Japan bought
and sold, but market players have said the BOJ bought the
dollar against the yen.
 The total size of the G7 intervention is still not known.
 Canada played a minor role, offering moral support as only
a tiny portion of its $60.6 billion in foreign reserves are in
yen.
 G7 finance chiefs will discuss the economic impact of the
Japan disaster at an April 14 meeting in Washington.

(Recasts, adds quote, updates prices, adds details)
 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar for a second straight day on Tuesday, extending declines
from a five-month high, knocked by a ratings downgrade of
Portugal and a rise in Chinese interest rates.
 The decision by China to hike interest rates by 25 basis
points, the fourth rate increase since October, also dented
higher-yielding currencies like the Australian dollar..
 Sterling gained after strong data boosted the chances of a
UK rate hike.
 Moody's cut Portugal's sovereign debt rating by one notch,
saying debt problems on the euro zone periphery may prevent the
European Central Bank from raising rates an anticipated three
times this year. Reports that Portugal's biggest banks
threatened to stop buying government's debt, instead urging the
caretaker administration to seek a short-term loan, also put
pressure on the single currency.
 The euro is expected to stay stuck in its recent range
ahead of the ECB's policy meeting on Thursday, after Monday's
rally to a five-month high stalled ahead of resistance around
$1.4280. That coincides with November's high of $1.4283 and a
trendline drawn from the July 2008 record high.
 ""With the looming ECB decision and press conference the
euro has been well supported, but is likely now entering a
range that will hold until Thursday,"" said Camilla Sutton,
senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""For
new highs to be reached from here, we will need to hear a
fairly hawkish ECB President Trichet.""
 Widespread expectations for a 25 basis point rate hike by
the ECB on Thursday continued to support the euro, with
reported bids from $1.4140 seen limiting losses.
 Adrian Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds, said the
euro ""is still in an uptrend, though people are wary of taking
the euro higher ahead of the ECB meeting.
 ""I think it will break $1.4280 but we may need to see a
narrowing in peripheral yield spreads (over German Bunds)
before it makes much progress above there,"" he said.
 Traders said a break to the topside would expose large
option barriers at $1.4350 and $1.4400, expiring around the
middle of April. They also highlighted a large option at
$1.4100, expiring on Friday, which could influence price
action.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.4183, pulling back from
a five-month high hit on Monday.
 Further resistance was at $1.4374, the 76.4 percent
retracement of the euro's slide from November 2009 to June
2010.
 ""There is a lot of good news priced into the euro already,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen, and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet ""will have to
support the rate view to keep the positive momentum.""
 The Australian dollar traded down as low as $1.0288, taking
it further from its post float high touched on Monday. The
Australian dollar was floated in December 1983.
 Given trade links, the Aussie can be the most sensitive to
moves by China to tighten monetary policy because Australian
exports could fall. The aussie last traded down 0.4 percent at
$1.0320.
 STERLING SHINES; FED MINS AHEAD
 An unexpected leap in UK services sector activity to a
13-month high buoyed the pound, which rose as much as 1 percent
versus the euro as the market moved closer toward pricing in a
UK rate hike in June.
 ""Sterling is the main mover after the PMI data was vastly
higher than expected, and there may be a little more potential
for UK rate expectations to be pulled up further,"" Lloyds'
Schmidt said.
 Sterling was last up 0.8 percent against the dollar at
$1.6261.
 Later on Tuesday, minutes of the Federal Reserve March 15
meeting will be scrutinized for hints on whether U.S.
policymakers may be edging toward a tighter monetary stance.
Some Fed officials have struck a hawkish tone recently, while
others have remained dovish.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 84.29 yen,
edging closer to a six-month peak set on Friday. A 200-day
moving average at around 83.55 is now seen acting as support.

 * OECD sees self-sustained recovery in major countries
 * Inflation risks rising despite slack in the economy
 
 By Leigh Thomas
 PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has
""good reasons"" to raise interest rates this week, and this would
have little impact on weaker euro zone countries struggling with
debt crises, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said on Tuesday.
 The ECB is expected to become the first major central bank
to begin raising interest rates since July 2008 after inflation
in the 17-nation euro zone hit 2.6 percent in March.
 The OECD said central bankers increasingly need to focus on
tackling inflation as the economic recovery takes root in major
economies, adding that some of its members faced the risk of
inflation becoming ""un-anchored"". 
 ""We see inflationary expectations creeping upwards a bit
everywhere, I would say, in Europe, in the United States, in the
UK,"" OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan said in an interview
with Reuters. 
 ""Central banks should keep inflation expectations under
control,"" he said. 
 The OECD also forecast that growth in the G7 excluding
crisis-hit Japan would average 3.2 percent on an annualised
basis in the first quarter and 2.9 percent in the second, after
growth of 2.3 percent and 2.1 percent in the third and fourth
quarters of last year. For table, see
 The forecasts were broadly stronger than the Paris-based
organisation's last forecasts in November but used different
methodology so were hard to compare precisely.
 ""Growth perspectives are higher all across the OECD area,
and the recovery is becoming self-sustained, which means there
will be less need for fiscal or monetary policy support,"" Padoan
told a news conference.
 He also told Reuters that a minor increase in ECB rates
would have a limited impact on weaker euro zone countries as
they are already paying high interest rates.
 ""That is not a source of concern. They would gain from
inflationary expectations being (kept) down because this would
keep market interest rates down,"" he said.
 ""The ECB has a very strong record of keeping monetary
stability at around 2 percent and this has helped growth. I
don't think (an ECB rate hike) will hurt European growth,"" he
added.
 
 NO JAPAN
 The OECD did not include Japan in its forecasts for G7
economies because of the uncertainty over the country's economic
outlook following the earthquake and tsunami there last month. 
 However, it said that in a first estimate the disasters
might cut 0.2-0.6 percent percentage points off first-quarter
growth in Japan and 0.5-1.4 points in the second quarter.
 Some of the slowdown in activity could be offset by a
reconstruction boom starting as quickly as in the third quarter.
 The OECD saw growth in the three biggest euro zone economies
-- France, Germany and Italy -- accelerating rapidly, expanding
3.0 percent as a group in the in the first quarter on an
annualised basis and 2.2 percent in the second quarter. 
 That would mark a sharp upturn from last year when the three
countries saw growth of 1.9 percent and 1.2 percent in the third
and fourth quarters respectively.

 * International prices unlikely to fall on ruling -analysts

 (Adds quotes, background)
 By Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, April 5 (Reuters) - India's top court lifted a
ban on iron ore shipments from the state of Karnataka on
Tuesday, freeing up about a quarter of supplies from the world's
third-largest exporter as strong demand from China keeps prices
firm.
 The southern Indian state had banned shipments of iron ore
from 10 ports and stopped its transport to other ports for
exports in July last year, citing a drive against illegal mining
and the need to preserve the raw material for local steelmakers.
 ""The court ordered that after April 20 the state government
order on the ban will be null and void,"" said Ankur Kulkarni, a
lawyer for S.B. Minerals, one of the petitioners.
 Lawyers of both sides said the April 20 date gives the state
time to put in place infrastructure such as checkpoints and
satellite tracking systems to prevent illegal mining.
 Karnataka's government will return to the court in the first
week of May to report steps taken to curb illegal mining, an
approach the federal government prefers to blanket export bans.
 ""Once the court satisfies itself with the measures taken by
the state it will formalise the lifting of the ban,"" said Sumeet
Goyal, lawyer for iron ore producers and petitioner, MSPL.
 India has quadrupled taxes on iron ore exports and raised
freight rates to boost the domestic steel industry and create
jobs.
 But it does not have the technology to absorb all of its
low-grade fines locally and a total export ban could create
problems of storage besides losing billions of dollars in export
revenues.
 India ranks behind Australia and Brazil in output with most
of its approximately 100 million tonnes of annual shipments
landing in China, which has the world's largest steel industry.
 India's iron ore exports fell for an eighth consecutive
month in February as Karnataka's ban cut sales.
 Tighter supply from India had helped global prices soar,
with spot prices hitting a record near $200 a tonne in
mid-February.
 
 INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIES
 Analysts say iron ore prices are unlikely to collapse
following the court ruling, with demand from China remaining
strong and new additional capacity in the global seaborne market
unlikely to come through until 2013 or 2014.
 Indian traders agreed prices were unlikely to fall.
 ""I do not expect exports to rise due to two important
reasons. The one is high export duty, while the other is the
steep rail freight,"" R. K. Sharma, secretary-general at the
200-member Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI), told
Reuters.
 Prices began to bounce back late last month as Chinese
steelmakers replenished run-down inventories.
 Spot iron ore prices are up a modest 2-5 percent this year
after sliding from the record levels in February.
 India produced around 226 million tonnes of iron ore in
2009/10 and exported some 117 million tonnes, mostly to China.
The western state of Goa is the biggest exporter.
 Exporters and miners from Karnataka had first challenged the
ban in the state's high court, but lost. They petitioned the
Supreme Court in November.
 The court order weakens plans by other top Indian iron ore
producing states Orissa and Chhattisgarh to ban exports.
 Shares in Indian iron ore miner Sesa Goa jumped 6.5 percent
to 314.20 rupees after the top court decision. The company is
owned by Vedanta Resources which is poised to hear whether it
will win government approval to buy a majority stake in Cairn
Energy's Indian assets.

 * Zloty, bond yields rise after Belka comments
 
 (Adds quotes, market reaction, background)
 By Marcin Goettig and Pawel Bernat
 WARSAW, April 5 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank raised
borrowing costs for the second time this year on Tuesday citing
increased inflation risks and signalled more rate rises lay
ahead.
 The bank's 10-strong Monetary Policy Council (MPC) increased
the key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.0
percent, as expected, giving a boost to the zloty currency.
 ""In the assessment of the Council, continuing economic
recovery in Poland and further employment growth may gradually
increase wage and inflationary pressures in the medium term,""
the bank said in a statement.
 ""At the same time, a rise in inflation expectations combined
with a surge in commodity prices across the world create the
risk that heightened inflation will persist.""
 Inflation stood at 3.6 percent in February on an annual
basis, unchanged from the previous month, but well above the
central bank's 2.5 percent target.
 Recent data showed Polish households' expectations for
inflation over the next 12 months had risen to 4.6 percent in
March, up from 3.2 percent in the previous month, raising fears
of greater wage pressures.
 Central bank governor Marek Belka signalled that further
monetary tightening lay ahead after January's and now April's
hikes of 25 basis points each.
 ""I can't say that we are nearing the end of the tightening
cycle,"" Belka told a news conference, adding he did not think
the bank had acted too late in raising rates.
 
 ZLOTY, BOND YIELDS FIRM
 The zloty rose to around 4.004 to the euro and bond yields
at the short end of the curve also firmed after Belka's
relatively hawkish tone.
 ""We expect another 25 basis point rate hike in July and one
more in the autumn,"" said Grzegorz Ogonek, an economist at ING
Bank, after the news conference.
 Twenty-three of 29 analysts polled by Reuters had forecast
Tuesday's interest rate increase.
 Poland's economy is expected to grow by about 4.4 percent in
the first quarter of this year, the same pace as in the last
three months of 2010, the bank's statement said.
 Earlier, a source close to the government told Reuters the
figure could stand at around 4 percent on an annual basis.
 But Belka said the majority view on the MPC was that the
pace of growth in itself did not mean accelerating inflation.
 At this month's sitting, the MPC had to take into account
the likelihood that the European Central Bank will raise euro
zone interest rates on Thursday, a move that would have left the
zloty looking vulnerable in the absence of a Polish rate rise.
 ""The signals coming from the ECB and its decision on
Thursday will be important for the MPC,"" said Maciej Reluga,
chief economist at Bank Zachodni WBK, adding that he did not
expect another rate hike at the next Polish sitting in May.
 ""We expect two more interest rate rises this year,"" he said.

 LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell from a five-month
high versus the dollar on Tuesday, knocked by a Portugal ratings

jumped after strong data boosted the chances of a UK rate hike.
 The Chinese hike, by 25 basis points, also dented

 Moody's cut Portugal's sovereign debt rating by one notch,

policymakers may be edging towards a tighter stance. Some Fed
officials have struck a hawkish tone recently, although others
have remained dovish.
 The U.S. dollar was up 0.2 percent against a basket of
currencies at 76.025.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 84.30 yen, edging closer to a
six-month peak of 84.735 yen set on Friday. A 200-day moving
average at around 83.55 is now seen acting as support.

 * Inflation pressures still strong, could squeeze profits
 * China hikes rates, ECB expected to follow suit on Thursday
 * India services PMI slips slightly from 7-month high
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Service sector businesses in
Britain and the euro zone powered ahead in March, with inflation
squeezing company margins before an expected euro zone interest
rate rise this week, business surveys showed.
 The European Central Bank is tipped to raise rates on
Thursday by a quarter point from a record low 1.0 percent. The
People's Bank of China raised its deposit and lending rates by
25 basis points on Tuesday, for the fourth time since October,
in an ongoing battle to rein in inflation.
 Tuesday's purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), which measure
business activity at thousands of companies, suggested economic
growth in the first quarter could surpass economists'
expectations for both the euro zone and Britain.
 The UK services PMI jumped unexpectedly in March to its
highest level in over a year, while the equivalent euro zone
survey showed service sector companies enjoying their fastest
upturn since August 2007.
 ""The evidence on the euro zone side has been a bit more
consistent (than the UK's), but what the headline figures don't
show is the extent of the diversity between the countries in the
euro zone,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.
 France and Germany again pushed the euro zone services PMI
higher, but growth in Ireland slowed and Spain resumed a
long-term trend of contraction among its services firms.
 The comparable U.S. non-manufacturing ISM survey, due at
1400 GMT, is expected to slip marginally to 59.5 in March from a
five-year high of 59.7.
 The surveys showed prices paid by companies for raw
materials and good soared again in March but a yawning gap opened
between input and output prices, with neither euro zone nor
British businesses feeling they could pass on soaring costs to
consumers already under a pall of austerity measures.
 ""The difference between the input price and output prices
does imply that margins are getting squeezed,"" said Shaw.
 The problem of high inflation is something companies in
emerging markets like India and China have battled for the last
two years -- underlined by the latest policy move from the
Chinese central bank.
 If the ECB follows suit on Thursday, it will become the
first among the big four central banks -- it plus the U.S.
Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and Bank of England -- to
begin raising rates.
 For some sectors, rising costs have already taken their
toll. Sales at euro zone retailers, an area not included in
Tuesday's PMI data, fell unexpectedly in February by 0.1
percent, figures from the European Union showed.
 
 BRITISH SURGE
 In Britain, the Markit/CIPS services PMI surged to a
13-month high of 57.1 in March from 52.6 in February, beating
even the most optimistic forecast and keeping comfortably above
the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction.
 ""It's extraordinarily strong, and it's puzzling. In some
ways you can argue that maybe last month's print was on the soft
side, though it was in line with the autumn,"" said Ross Walker,
economist at RBS.
 Survey compiler Markit said the data pointed to a 0.8
percent quarterly expansion for the economy as a whole in the
first three months of 2011, compared with the latest consensus
expectations for 0.7 percent.

 Sterling hit its strongest rate against the dollar in two
weeks on Tuesday, while gilt futures and stocks fell after the
PMI data renewed expectations of an interest rate hike. Markets
are pricing in a move by the BoE next month.
 The euro zone services PMI rose from 56.8 in February to
57.2, its best showing in almost four years and the input price
component leapt above 60 for the first time since the oil price
boom of 2008. Brent crude oil is trading at just over $120 a
barrel, near a 2-1/2 year high.
 While few signs have emerged that feared second-round
inflation effects are taking hold in Europe so far, the Indian
PMI showed booming wage costs driving input prices there much
higher.
 The HSBC Indian PMI slipped to 58.8 in March from a
seven-month high of 60.2 in February, showing a fast-growing
services sector struggling to keep up with rampant inflation.
 ""Inflation remains the dominant concern, not growth, calling
for the Reserve Bank of India to continue the tightening cycle,""
said Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India & ASEAN at HSBC.
 The official Chinese non-manufacturing PMI on Monday showed
growth of input prices slowed in March for the fourth month
running as headline index hit a five-month high of 60.2, up from
44.1 in February.

831,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2011 07:16AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-After brief hiatus, emerging markets are back"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - The exodus of investors from
emerging market equities that began late last year is reversing,
in part due to the prospects for higher interest rates in
developed economies and partly due to them becoming cheaper.
 Moves to date reflect a classic rotation by investors back
into a long-term bull play that had become overbought. While
still tentative, they may be a precursor for a larger embrace of
high-growth emerging markets later in the quarter.
 Emerging market equities were among the hottest investor
plays for much of 2009 and 2010, with MSCI's benchmark index for
the sector rising nearly 150 percent from March 2009 until
mid-January this year.
 Until recently, however, many investors had switched out of
the sector, believing it to be overbought and at a disadvantage
to resurgent developed markets, particularly the United States.
The index was in the red for most of the first quarter.
 This has changed dramatically in the space of a week or so.
The index has gained around 10 percent since hitting a
post-Japanese earthquake low on March 17. It is now up more than
3.6 percent for the year to date.
 Developed market stocks have underperformed, rising about 7
percent since March 17, although they remain the better bet for
the year to date, up more than 5 percent.
 It is not just market movements that suggest some kind of
return is underway.
 EPFR Global noted that emerging market equity funds it
tracked ended the first quarter with their highest weekly
inflow, a net $2.6 billion, since the first week of January.
This contrasted with a net 24.5 billion being pulled out in
the quarter for a whole.
 U.S. financial services firm State Street, meanwhile, sees
increasing moves towards emerging market equities and currencies
in the multi-trillion dollar portfolios it keeps as custodian.
 ""Flows into certain high-beta currencies -- namely the IDR
(Indonesia), KRW (Korea), MXN (Mexico) and ZAR (South Africa) --
have firmed, while the past month has seen cross-border equity
flows into EM once again outpace developed markets,"" it said.

 CHANGING LANDSCAPE
 Expected rate rises from the European Central Bank starting
this week and the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will
not extend ultra-loose monetary policy have contributed to this
change.
 Part of this year's earlier rotation was based on
assumptions that monetary policy designed to boost economies in
developed economies would remain advantageous while higher rates
designed to cool growth in emerging markets were to be expected.
 That advantage has now dissipated.
 ""We saw food price inflation driving emerging monetary
policy, while nobody expected the ECB and Fed to move,"" said
Maarten-Jan Bakkum, emerging equity strategist at ING Asset
Management.
 ""Now that has changed completely. Emerging market central
banks are probably close to done.""
 China raised interest rates for the second time this year on
Tuesday but economists say it is well into its tightening cycle.
 Goldman Sachs, which predicted emerging markets sliding in
popularity in the first half of this year before picking up
again in the second, suggested that it may be time to switch
already, although it prefers developed stocks with emerging
exposure.
 ""After a few months of underperformance, we believe that
EM-exposed stocks should start outperforming again. The
growth/inflation outlook is improving in EM while developed
markets, especially in Europe, are likely to see an acceleration
in the pace of tightening,"" it said in a note.
 
 EARLY DAYS
 Monetary policy is not the only driver for emerging markets,
of course. Their hiatus from the investment landscape over the
first quarter or so has made them cheaper.
 I/B/E/S data shows the 12-month forward price to earnings
ratio for emerging market stocks at 10.8, compared with 11.6
back in November.
 Developed market stocks, meanwhile, have stayed at around
12.1, which means a valuation gap has opened up.
 Some firms have been taking advantage of this as the flow
data shows.
 Many of the moves to date, however,appear to be investors
shifting their recent underweight positions into more neutral
exposure.
 Credit Suisse has done just that and is eyeing the future
for emerging market gains to accelerate.
 The underlying appeal of fast growing emerging markets --
primarily a shift from West to East -- remains a strategic play
even if there is the occasional short-term tactical setback.
 Explaining his company's recent swing away from emerging
market stocks and then return, Lothar Mentel, chief investment
officer of Octopus Investments, said:
 ""We did not think that the overall massive growth story had
gone away. It was just a little bit over-stretched.""

 MOSCOW, April 5 (Reuters) - Rosneft, Russia's largest oil
company, will pay the full crude export duty from May 1 as oil
prices have reached new peaks, deputy finance minister Sergei
Shatalov said.
 ""Rosneft has agreed that with the current oil prices and in
the current environment, they are doing quite well ... If there

 Rosneft shares were down 1.5 percent at 1030 GMT, with

 Vankor, a key driver behind record oil production in Russia,
the world's top crude exporter, was one of 22 east Siberian
fields exempt from full export duty, set at $423.7 per tonne
this month. Vankor currently pays $191 per tonne.
 With a tax-break extension, Rosneft could have saved over $3
billion a year. Last month, the company head Eduard Khudainatov
asked Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to extend the benefits for
up to two more years, citing harsh Arctic weather and logistical
problems.
 Shatalov said the cancellation of the tax breaks had been
agreed by Rosneft chairman Igor Sechin, Russia's deputy prime
minister and the energy ministry.

833,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2011 06:44AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Weaker yen may be burden in disguise for Japan Inc," * Yen weakness may not help rebuilding after disaster
 * Currency weakness adds to cost of importing fuel
 * Could speed up deterioration in terms of trade
 * Yen down 9 pct from record high, further weakness seen
 * Yen fall already raising official alarm

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Japanese companies will face more
pain than relief from a weaker yen, which may have started a
long-term downtrend after a four-year ascent just when currency
strength would help the country pay for the reconstruction of
the quake-hit economy.	
 A weaker yen enhances export competitiveness for the likes
of Toyota Motor Inc and Canon Inc and is
therefore usually considered a boon for the world's
third-largest economy.	
 However, manufacturers are unlikely to benefit near term
from the yen's fall after the triple disaster of earthquake,
tsunami and nuclear crisis combined to idle production and so
reduce their chances of taking advantage of currency weakness.	
 ""Of course for companies which import raw material, fuel and
resources, a weaker yen makes things difficult and it is in a
way a one-two punch,"" said Kazutaka Oshima, president at Rakuten
Investment Management, a fund manager.	
 The yen , trading on Tuesday at 84.25 per
dollar, has dropped 9 percent since hitting a record high of
76.25 shortly after the earthquake. The descent was helped by
rare coordinated intervention by Group of Seven central banks.	
 Markets are betting the yen will stay weak longer term
because Japan's central bank is likely to keep interest rates
low to aid recovery just as the euro zone and U.S. central banks
are poised to tighten monetary policy.	
 The prospect of rising interest rates tends to attract
capital for the higher returns. Indeed, the European Central
Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates on Thursday for
the first time since the global financial crisis.	
 The longer-term risk is that investors will think Japan's
already weak recovery from the global financial crisis will be
made even more difficult by the natural disaster and the battle
it unleashed to bring a nuclear power station under control.	
 ""After moving above 83 yen the trend seems to have changed.
Yen weakness may be reflecting a re-appraisal of the Japanese
economy and 'Sell Japan' mentality. There is a question mark
over the prospect for Japan's recovery -- partly because few
people realise how deep the impact from the nuclear crisis and
blackouts would be,"" Oshima said.	
 
 The fall in the yen has not gone unnoticed in Tokyo. Economy
Minister Kaoru Yosano warned the yen's weakness means rising
crude oil prices may directly hurt the economy. [ID:nLHE7EO01J]	
 The combination of crisis, high commodity prices and a
weaker yen could, for a time, speed up the decline in Japan's
terms of trade as import prices rise faster than export prices.
The terms of trade index is now below 80 from a high in 1994 of
145.6.	
 Manufacturing activity posted its steepest monthly decline
on record in March, a purchasing managers' survey showed, while
big manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen in the
next three months, another report said. [ID:nL3E7F4006]
[ID:nL3E7EU3P4]	
 Illustrating the plight of automakers, lost car production
in Japan in the two weeks since the quake has topped a third of
a million vehicles.	
 Nomura estimates Japanese firms on its 400 companies index
which include bluechips such as Sony Corp to chalk up
$17 billion in lost profits in the current fiscal year ending
next March.	
 
 DETERIORATING TRADE	
 Some firms, facing rising import bills, want to pass on
those costs to customers but that is proving difficult when
production lines are suspended and demand is falling.	
 Nippon Steel , for example, is seeking a roughly 25
percent price hike from domestic contract manufacturers to cover
surging input costs.	
 Ratings Agency Moody's, which is reviewing Nippon Steel and
rival JFE Holdings for a possible downgrade, said their
profits are likely to deteriorate as they face higher cost for
steel and coking coal, and falling demand.	
 ""We don't like steel. It is oversupplied in the region with
rising input cost and limited pricing power,"" said Arnout van
Rijn, Asia chief investment officer of Robeco, an asset
management firm.	
 ""In the near term we have to quantify the amount of earnings
downgrades that will result from this dramatic sequence of
events.""	
 A likely rise in imports and decline in exports as
production lines struggle to return to normal operations will
weigh on Japan's trade balance . 
 The balance in February was in deficit for first
time in 22 months.	
 Rising energy prices and Japan's increasing
oil-and-gas demand will be the biggest factors driving the rise
in imports.	
 International oil prices   are already hovering
near their highest levels since 2008 off the back of political
turmoil in the Middle East.	
 Japan's oil demand is set to rise sharply in coming months
after the natural disaster put nuclear power plants out of
operation.	
 Credit Suisse estimates higher imports from a shift to
thermal power generation would shave 2.8 trillion yen ($33
billion) off Japan's trade surplus in 2011.	
 That would be a sizeable hit when measures against Japan's
2010 trade surplus of 6.6 trillion yen.	
 ""Power outages may also keep companies from producing at
full capacity for quite a long time. It will take several months
to fix disruptions in supply chains,"" Eiji Hirano, former
executive director of the Bank of Japan, told Reuters.	
 ""While exports will slump mainly for manufacturers, imports
will rise as reconstruction demand picks up. That will affect
Japan's current account balance,"" said Hirano, who is now
executive vice president of Toyota Financial Services.	
 While a gradual yen decline would certainly boost exporters
once they get their production facilities back on track, they
will find it hard to adjust if currency swings were as wild as
they were in the past fortnight.	
 The yen rose to its record high of 76.25 per dollar from 82
per dollar in just two days, a massive rise for a currency. The
G7 intervention pushed it back to around 82 per dollar a day
later.	
 ""In our experience, if the yen weakens about 5 yen, we can
absorb it in six months, for about 10 yen, it takes a year,""
said Akio Nitori, president of Nitori Holdings Co ,
which operates a chain of furniture and interior goods stories.	
 ""As long as there isn't a sudden swing, (a weak yen) can be
dealt with,"" Nitori said at a results briefing. 
 The company, which imports more than 70 percent of the goods
in its Japan stores from overseas, has forecast its first annual
decline in profits in 25 years, citing the disaster and higher
raw materials prices.	
 Lower volatility would also suggest yen weakness over a
long-term horizon. UBS's calculations show that the yen's
nominal effective exchange rate falls 0.4 percent for every 1
percent decline in one-month dollar/yen volatility.	
 Naomi Fink, Japan strategist at Jefferies, says rising
import costs would accelerate the trend for firms to move their
production base offshore.	
 ""Yen weakness only compounds the rising cost of imports. If
you don't have to convert to yen in the first place you don't
need to worry about it,"" she said.

 By Soo Ai Peng and Tony Zhou	
 SHANGHAI/BEIJING, April 5 (Reuters) - China's central bank
increased interest rates on Tuesday for the fourth time since
October, raising suspicions that data next week may show
inflation rose more than expected in March.	
 China's rate rise adds to six official increases in bank
reserves since October and underlines Beijing's determination to
clamp down on inflation, which leaders have declared as their
most important task this year to keep the world's fastest
growing major economy on track.	
 The increase comes before the European Central Bank is
expected to raise its rates on Thursday for the first time since
the global financial crisis, showing how inflation is rising to
the top of the global policy agenda.	
 ""The March inflation figures must be very high,"" said Xu
Biao, economist with China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen.	
 ""It is an aggressive move, and the central bank is acting
more aggressively than the market had expected. The latest
interest rate rise, although at only one quarter point, may hurt
investor confidence and the real economy quite significantly.
More importantly, it is not the end of China's monetary policy
tightening.""	
 Benchmark one-year deposit and lending rates were lifted by
25 basis points to 3.25 percent and 6.31 percent respectively,
the People's Bank of China said in a statement on its website.	
 The rises take effect from April 6, when financial markets
in China reopen following public holidays on Monday and Tuesday.	
 China is due to report the March consumer price index on
April 15. Economists expect the data to show that consumer
inflation rose to 5.1 percent in March, matching a 28-month high
seen in November.	
 Inflation was 4.9 percent in February, unchanged from
January. Beijing is aiming for inflation to average 4 percent
this year.	
 
 Metals and crude prices eased after the news of China's rate
rise on fears tighter policy will restrict the country's demand
for commodities. The Australian dollar, a proxy currency for
commodities, also fell. [ID:nLDE7340FY]	
 ""We did expect a rate hike in April so it's not a complete
surprise,"" said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank
in Copenhagen.	
 ""They are raising rates to stem the inflationary pressures
in the economy. We expect another two hikes of 25 basis points
each this year. We are already seeing a slowdown in the Chinese
economy but they need to raise rates a couple more times.	
 ""They will still use reserve requirement increases but they
also need to raise rates. I think they will use different tools
(to tackle inflation).""	
 
 INFLATION PRESSURES	
 Food prices have been the main driver of China's inflation.
Although monetary policy has little affect on food prices, since
people have to eat, the tightening reflects concerns that price
pressures will spread to other parts of the economy and so raise
inflation expectations.	
 Underscoring those worries, consumer goods giants Procter &
Gamble and Unilever  had both planned to
raise prices for detergent and soap by 15 percent this month,
local media reported on March 28.	
 Unilever agreed to comply with a request from authorities to
postpone its price rises, the Financial Times reported on
Saturday. [ID:nL3E7F200V]	
 Sharply rising commodities prices, including international
crude prices that are hovering around their highest levels in
more than two years, are another inflation threat. 
 The economy, which grew more than 10 percent in 2010, is
vacuuming up commodities globally to satisfy the drive for
growth.	
 Analysts have said they expect inflation in China to peak
around the middle of the year.	
 ""This rate hike suggests that the March CPI that is to be
released early next week may have surprised to the upside. Our
current CPI forecast is 5.2 percent y/y for March,"" said Qing
Wang, an economist with Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, in a note
to clients. 
 ""It also suggests that Chinese authorities are confident in
the sustainability of underlying growth momentum."" 
 There are some signs that the raft of monetary tightening,
which has been accompanied with prices controls, is starting to
take effect. Indeed, the central bank drained 300 billion yuan
($46 billion) in cash from money markets in March through open
market operations after injecting cash in January and February,
to add to the tightening.	
 A central bank survey released in March showed more
households were satisfied with current price levels and saw
less chance of rising inflation. [ID:nTOE72F01E]	
 Purchasing managers' surveys last week also showed price
pressures were easing. [ID:nL3E7F104Q]	
 
 GLOBAL CONCERN	
 Most central banks in emerging markets in Asia and Latin
America have raised interest rates as the regions emerged
strongly from the global financial crisis.	
 But major central banks in the developed world are now
showing signs of starting to catch up.	
 The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest
rates on Thursday by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent after
inflation rose above its target. [ID:nSLAUEE7RO]	
 Comments from some Federal Reserve policymakers have raised
market expectations that the U.S. central bank is moving towards
a tighter policy.	
 So far, complaints among Chinese about rising prices have
amounted to little more than grumbles, but serious inflation has
sparked social unrest in China in the past.	
 ""This is ultimately good news because it reduces the risk of
policy error in China that markets were getting nervous about,""
Benoit Anne, head of emerging markets strategy at Societe
General, said of the rate rise.	
 ""It reduces the danger of Chinese policymakers being too
dovish and shows them addressing the mounting inflation risk
which is a massive tail risk for emerging markets. We will see a
few more hikes as China needs more monetary tightening.""	
 The central bank boosted bank reserves, or the amount of
cash that banks have to put aside, by 50 basis points to 20
percent on March 18.	
 The move locks up cash that banks could otherwise lend out
and potentially fuel inflation. Excess cash stemming from
China's vast trade surplus has been a root cause of the
country's inflation.

corn and soymeal rejected by Vietnam for containing insects have
been sold to Indonesia, while Indian exporters have not resumed
cargo sales to Vietnam, traders said on Tuesday.	
 The two ships held in late January at the northern port of
Haiphong and Cai Mep port in Ho Chi Minh City left for Indonesia
in late March, after the plant protection department rejected
proposals to refumigate the cargoes.	
 The quality of the corn and soymeal remained good after the
detention, traders familiar with the sales said. They did not
give further details.	
 The cargo's departure has ended efforts over the course of
about two months by sellers, buyers, Indian agricultural
officials and diplomats to seek a solution after a type of
beetle typical in India was detected, prompting the rejection.
The efforts included a visit by some Indian officials to Hanoi
and Haiphong ports.	
 
 Indian traders said exporters were still not selling cargoes
to Vietnam as they feared further rejections.	
 Since India has not heard of any other importer complaining
about quality, Indian traders said Vietnam's refusal to accept
cargoes might have some political overtones.	
 Traders in Vietnam have said given the Southeast Asian
country's traditional role as a key buyer of India's corn and
soymeal, they did not expect India to interfere strongly to get
the cargoes in, as this might hurt the overall relationship.	
 Corn prices in Vietnam had risen 11 percent after the
cargoes had been rejected, an industry official said.
[ID:nHAN213200]	
 Feed prices in Vietnam have now nearly doubled from a year
ago due to exchange rate changes, high bank interest rates and
rising production costs, as Vietnam imports 60 percent of the
material used for processing, state media said on Tuesday.	
 Feed prices were set to further increase in coming days
after Vietnam raised retail fuel prices last month following a
hike in electricity and a major devaluation of the dong by 8.5
percent in February. [ID:nSGE72S05A] [ID:nSGE71905S]

 By Nigel Davies
 MADRID, April 5 (Reuters) - Investors are perceiving Spain
in a more positive light and its economy is moving in the right
direction, but a full recovery will not happen until the second
half of 2012, the governor of the Bank of Spain said on Tuesday.
 ""We are on the right track to emerge well and even to emerge
stronger from the difficult situation that our economy and
banking system has (experienced),"" Miguel Angel Fernandez
Ordonez told a conference in Madrid.
 He predicted a difficult 2011 and a stronger recovery in the
second half of 2012.
 Spain has been a focus among international investors
concerned it might need a bailout, though an austerity drive has
help calmed those fears to a large extent.
 Ordonez said he anticipated few problems due to contagion
from the fiscal crisis in neighbouring Portugal, which many
market players do expect will need rescuing like fellow euro
zone members Ireland and Greece.
""It's still too early for vigorous (Spanish) growth to be
re-established. More effort will be needed to digest the
excesses associated with the property boom and it will take time
for net job creation to gather strength,"" Ordonez added.
 Spain's economy is expected to grow tepidly in each quarter
this year and the country may be forced to take additional
deficit-cutting measures should growth not reach a government
estimate of 1.3 percent for the year as a whole.
 Ordonez added in a speech that the central bank would
continue to force banks to provision against bad assets.
 Ongoing financial sector reform had helped narrow the spread

 * Has sugar cane ethanol projects with Tereos Internacional
 * Envisages buy-out as soon as 2013
 * Shares gain 4.2 percent

(Adds shares, additional details, background)
 By Sybille de La Hamaide and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier
 PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - French green biotech firm Deinove
, which hopes to use a 4 billion year old bacterium to develop
the fuel of the future, is eyeing new projects in the United
States and Brazil, its chief executive told Reuters.
 The company is talks with a large U.S. ethanol maker and
with Tereos Internacional, a Brazil-based unit of France's
Tereos group, to develop a bioethanol based not only on food but
also on a bacterium named deinococcus, discovered in a U.S.
corned beef tin in 1956, Deinove CEO Jacques Biton said.
 Deinove, which has a market capitalisation of 43 million
euros ($61 million), was also negotiating a project in Brazil
based on paper pulp, Biton said, but he declined to give further
details.
 Biton said the company was looking for investors who could
provide it with an emergency cash cushion of 1 or 2 million
euros and boost development. But he stressed the company, which
listed in Paris last year, had enough to last until 2014, when
it expects to be profitable.
 ""What we are looking for are industrial partnerships, and
technological, and research, but I would like to have another
industrial firm among our shareholders,"" Biton said in an
interview.
 He said the firm, created in 2006, which also seeks to apply
its technology to antibiotics and green chemistry, could either
buy back some of its own shares, take on a new major
stakeholder, or even become a takeover target as early as 2013.
 ""I really think that if we do very well, as soon as 2013
there will be a firm that will want to buy us,"" he said.
 Deinove is controlled by French venture capital fund Truffle
Capital, whose stake could fall to 64 percent from 75 percent
after some options are exercised. Tereos Internacional, which
invested 1 million euros when the company was launched on the
Alternext stock exchange in April, has a share of 2.5 percent.
 The company's shares were up 4.2 percent at 9.22 euros after
Biton's comments to Reuters were made public, bringing the
stock's gains to 16 percent since its launch in April 2010.
After a poor performance through most of last year it has more
than doubled since Jan. 1.
 Biton stressed that although Deinove was in talks for a
deal, it did not want to rush to sell more biofuel licences and
could afford to wait until it further develops its technology.
 Deinove is already working with Tereos Internacional on a
pilot project due to be launched in 2013 at its wheat-based
ethanol plant in France. It is now looking at how to apply the
process to Tereos's sugar-cane-based ethanol units in Brazil,
Biton said.
 The company discovered 7,000 types of deinococchus, dubbed
""Conan the Bacterium"" for its strength in resisting
radioactivity, heat, cold and dehydration, and says it aims to
develop ""third-generation biofuels"" that would go beyond
ethanol, which can be corrosive to engines.
 ""If we want to remain in the race, we need to aim for
advanced fuels,"" Biton said.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2011 04:12AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS-Portugal yields hit highs; metals fall on China," * Portugal bond yield at new high as bailout fears grow
 * Metal prices, Aussie fall after China rate rise
 * Euro slips; world stocks end five-day winning streak
 
(Adds U.S. stock futures, China graphic)
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Portuguese bond yields rose to
euro lifetime highs on Tuesday as the country moved closer to a
possible debt bailout, hitting the euro, which fell further from
a five-month peak versus the dollar after China raised rates.
 Metal prices and the Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for
Chinese growth because of raw materials exports to the world's
second largest economy, fell after Beijing hiked interest rates
for the fourth time since October to cool inflation.
 China's tightening also dented Brent crude prices, which
pulled back further from 32-month highs but stayed just above
$120 a barrel as markets focused on fears that unrest in
producer states in Africa and the Middle East could disrupt
supply. 
 Global stocks snapped a five-day winning streak, and U.S.
stock index futures fell 0.2 to 0.7 percent, indicating a weak
start on Wall Street.
 Rating agency Moody's earlier cut Portugal's sovereign debt
by one notch, saying it believed the incoming government would
urgently need to seek financial aid from the EU.
 ""Even though Moody's still rates the sovereign two notches
higher than Standard & Poor's, the downgrade is another blow to
sentiment,"" said Gavan Nolan, an analyst at data monitor Markit.
 There were also reports that Portuguese banks may be
threatening to stop buying government bonds to pressure Lisbon
into seeking a bailout, following the same path as Greece and
Ireland.
 Yields on Portugal's 10-year government bonds rose to 9.033
percent, while Portuguese stocks fell 0.9 percent,
underperforming the broader FTSEurofirst 300 index, which was
flat.
 Credit default swaps implied a 41 percent probability of a
Portuguese default within five years, compared with 33 percent
at the end of February, data provider CMA said.
 
 EURO PRESSURED
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4163, off a five-month
high of $1.4268 hit on Monday, and down 0.1 percent at 119.39
yen, while the Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to $1.0318.
 Market doubts over whether the single currency can make
fresh gains given that players have already positioned
themselves for interest rate rises in the euro zone during 2011
also put pressure on the euro, which has risen 5.9 percent
against the dollar and 9.9 percent versus the yen this year.
 ""There is a lot of good news priced into the euro already
and (ECB President Jean-Claude) Trichet will have to support the
rate view to keep the positive momentum,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The European Central Bank is widely expected to raise rates
by 25 basis points on Thursday from a record low of 1 percent to
tame inflationary pressures.

 
 OIL IMPACT
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said late on Monday
that the recent spike in U.S. inflation was unlikely to persist.
 But a sustained higher oil price could pose a serious threat
to the global economic recovery and dampen risk appetite, and
commodity price pressures saw silver rise to a 31-year high.
 ""The recent rally in oil has had virtually no impact on
equities. It was just over a month ago where equities markets
were nervous about the impact of oil prices on the economy,""
Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note.
 ""The difference this time is that the rise has likely been
due to decent growth rather than immediate geopolitical
concerns. Nevertheless one would expect the creeping price of
oil to start to get more attention given the recent rally.""
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index fell
0.3 percent after hitting six-week highs in the previous
session, while emerging market shares were flat.
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average lost 1.1 percent with
investors still wary about the long-term impact of last month's
massive earthquake and tsunami and a resulting nuclear accident
that workers are still struggling to contain.
 Brent crude eased after hitting a 32-month high of $121.29
on Monday as Nigerian election delays and a short-lived strike
in Gabon added to supply jitters for a market already on edge
over fighting in Libya and unrest in Yemen, which borders top
producer Saudi Arabia.
 Silver dipped 0.3 percent after rising to its highest since
early 1980 at $38.77 an ounce before the Chinese rate rise,
while gold fell 0.3 percent and copper lost 0.2 percent, down
for the third day in a row.

 SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - The Australian government said
on Tuesday it was inclined to reject the Singapore Exchange
Ltd's proposed $7.8 billion takeover bid for
Australian stock-exchange operator ASX on national
interest grounds.	
 
 COMMENTARY:	
 BARNABY JOYCE, OPPOSITION NATIONALS SENATE LEADER	
 ""The reality is that the Australian stock exchange being run
from Singapore was never going to be a great outcome for
Australia. The silence has been deafening from those who have
been advocating politically for the ASX to go to Singapore.	
 ""If the Australia Stock Exchange had gone to Singapore, then
a large section of the commerce of Sydney was superfluous to
requirements and those jobs would have gone to Singapore.""	
 
 BOB BROWN, GREENS PARTY LEADER 
 ""If they restructure the deal, we'll look at it. But so
what, it will still be controlled from Singapore regardless.""	
 
 DANIEL GOLDBERG, SPECIALIST M&A LAWYER, ADDISONS	
 ""It's a very unusual decision -- an outright rejection is
very rare, there aren't many of them. It's very surprising that
they didn't take the full time they could have to make this
decision.""

SENG CHOON LENG, HEAD OF RESEARCH AT DMG & PARTNERS	
 ""In the short term, this should lend some strength to SGX's
share price as the majority of the market players feel that if
the deal doesn't go through, it's better for SGX. They were
concerned that the price SGX was paying for ASX was too hefty.
If the deal really falls through, they could look for other
areas of growth, for example, attracting more foreign listings.""	
 
 ANDREW MARTIN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALPHINITY INVESTMENT
MANAGEMENT	
 ""I'm not that surprised, given what we'd heard in the
market. The general view was it was going to be hard to get
over the line. Whether it's with SGX or someone else, ASX will
keep trying to do something, given what's going on with their
peers offshore...A straight-out takeover's probably not going to
happen. If Singapore's not allowed, why would someone else be
allowed to?""	
 
 ANGUS GLUSKIE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WHITE FUNDS MANAGEMENT	
 ""It is not completely surprising but in light of the
consolidation we are seeing in the world of exchanges this kind
of decision is surprising. I think the exchanges themselves will
still see consolidation as being an absolute must for them.""	
 
 SHANE DELPHINE, FUND MANAGER, KARARA CAPITAL	
 ""Clearly the political dynamics were becoming challenging
for the deal and as time passed it looked unlikely. The latest
move is a clear signal if a deal needs to be done, then ASX and
SGX will have to radically change the terms of the deal. A
merger of equals will pass. ASX might also talk to other
exchanges like HKEX.""	
 ""I never thought the logic of consolidation was as
compelling for the ASX like some of its peers in America or
Europe. I believe for quite some time the ASX can stand alone
successfully.""	
 
 MARK DANIELS, HEAD OF EQUITIES, ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT	
 (Aberdeen owns ASX shares) 
 ""Everybody else across the world seems open to it (exchange
consolidation) except Australia. I don't know why it should be
rejected on national interest. ASX and SGX will certainly be
disappointed...Having said that, the ASX is a very well run
company, that is the consolation here.""

 JASON BEDDOW, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ARGO INVESTMENTS	
 ""It's not such a surprise really. Governments are getting
pretty tough on lots of things. I wouldn't say governments are
particularly business-friendly at the moment.	
 ""As this (review of the merger) has gone on longer, most
people were of the view it was getting pretty hard.""	
 
 JOHN SEVIOR, HEAD OF AUSTRALIAN EQUITIES, PERPETUAL
INVESTMENTS	
 ""The duty of the board is to maximise the interests of all
shareholders. I don't think that changes as a result of this
statement. That's what they're there to do. I'm disappointed but
not surprised.""	
 
 MARKET REACTION	
 Shares in ASX fell after Treasurer Wayne Swan said he had
intended to block the deal. The stock ended down 3.3 percent at
A$33.70 after dipping as low as 33.35. Meanwhile SGX shares were
up 4.6 percent at S$8.39.	
 
 BACKGROUND	
 * SGX's bid for ASX, first announced in October, was under
pressure from Australian politicians because it was seen as
ceding control over a key national institution and a de-facto
monopoly.	
 * Investors had deemed the deal likely to fail in its
current form, but said consolidation was still inevitable. The
global finance industry is being transformed by a wave of
mergers that includes a proposed tie-up between NYSE Euronext
and Deutsche Boerse .	
 * Political opposition comes despite the SGX bowing to
pressure and agreeing to give ASX an equal number of directors
in a merged group. Last month, the Sydney Morning Herald quoted
a senior government source as saying that if the Foreign
Investment Review Board did not stop the deal, the Treasury
certainly would.	
 * The SGX was offering 3.473 SGX shares plus A$22 for each
ASX share.

 * Aussie dips on profit-taking
 * RBA keeps interest rates unchaned as expected

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro hovered below a
five-month high against the dollar on Tuesday as investors
assessed whether it can make fresh gains given that market
players have already positioned themselves for a series of
interest rate hikes in the euro zone during 2011.	
 The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates by a
quarter point from a record low of 1 percent at a meeting on
Thursday to rein in inflationary pressures, with two more 25
basis point hikes priced in by year-end .	
 But the single currency has already risen more than 6
percent against the dollar and more than 10 percent versus the
yen this year, making investors reluctant to buy more ahead of
the meeting this week.	
 The euro's rally has stalled right below resistance at its
November high of $1.4283. That level is also crucial as it
roughly coincides with trendline resistance drawn from the
euro's record high set in July 2008. 
 ""For the ECB, an April interest rate hike is a done deal and
one or two more hikes are priced in. It's hard to see a positive
surprise from here,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist
at Barclays Bank.	
 ""Still, the euro zone would be the first to raise interest
rates, which supports the euro. Expectations for diversification
flows from higher oil prices are also positive. There is also a
risk that the Fed minutes may show a hawkish tone.""	
 The euro fell 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday to
$1.4203 , pulling away from a five-month high of $1.4269
hit on Monday on trading platform EBS.	
 A rise above its November peak of $1.4283 could open the way
to $1.4374, the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's slide
from November 2009 to June 2010. Support is seen at $1.4190,
with traders citing stops through to below $1.4150. 
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent against the yen to 119.77 yen
, close to its 11-month peak of 120.073 yen hit on
Monday.	
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 84.33 yen , edging
closer to a six-month peak of 84.735 yen set on Friday. A
200-day moving average at around 83.55 is now seen acting as
support.	
 
 FOCUS ON CENTRAL BANKS	
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.4 percent to $1.0323
, pressured by profit-taking in the wake of its rise to
a 29-year high of $1.0422 the previous day. There was talk of
both bids and stop-loss offers around $1.0300.	
 The Aussie dollar took in its stride the Reserve Bank of
Australia's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.75
percent as widely expected. [ID:nL3E7F40J2]	
 Some market players said, however, that position unwinding
could temper gains in the Aussie from here on.	
 ""In the medium term, the Aussie remains supported, but there
is some room for position reduction. Rather than looking for a
run-up in Aussie/U.S. dollar, you would look at Aussie/yen and
perhaps Aussie/Swiss franc,"" said Robert Ryan, senior G10
currency strategist for BNP Paribas in Singapore. 
 Later on Tuesday, focus will turn to the Fed minutes for
more hints on the Fed's policy outlook. 
 Underscoring the market's focus on Fed speakers, the dollar
edged higher against the yen and the euro earlier on Tuesday,
following comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke.	
 Currency traders, however, said that the move in the dollar
likely was due to the market having been short the dollar rather
than anything else.	
 Bernanke said a recent pick-up in U.S. inflation was driven
primarily by rising commodity prices globally, but added that
was unlikely to persist. [ID:nN04294041]	
 After a string of hawkish comments from Fed officials, some
U.S. central bankers have struck a more cautious tone. 
 On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said U.S.
inflation was likely to remain moderate and St.
Louis Fed Research Director Christopher Waller said the Fed was
likely to buy all the bonds it has said it would purchase by
June 30. [ID:nN04277975] 
 Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve
Bank, told CNBC on Monday the Fed's programme is most likely an
""adequate"" size. [ID:nWEN0460] 
 ""It is becoming increasingly evident (there is) a divergence
in opinions among Fed members. These different opinions among
Fed members may seep into the FOMC minutes later today,"" BNP
Paribas said in a note to clients.	
 ""This may be interpreted as hawkish, but we expect the Fed
to stand pat especially since we expect incoming data through Q2
to be on the weaker side.""

854,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2011 01:24AM ET</span>","WRAPUP 1-Australia central bank holds rates, sounds comfortable"," * RBA keeps rates at 4.75 pct as expected
 * Says inflation contained, Japan effect limited
 * Markets imply scant risk of hike for months yet

 By Wayne Cole	
 SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept
interest rates steady on Tuesday for a fifth month saying a
lofty local dollar, moderate wages growth and intense retail
competition would help keep inflation contained for the year
ahead.	
 The Australian dollar stayed very close to 29-year highs as
the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) surprised no one by leaving
its cash rate at 4.75 percent after its April policy meeting,
and sounded in no rush to move again.	
 ""At today's meeting, the board judged that the current
mildly restrictive stance of monetary policy remained
appropriate in view of the general macroeconomic outlook,"" RBA
Governor Glenn Stevens wrote in a brief statement.	
Interbank futures <0#YIB:> imply little risk of a further
hike until September at the earliest and only a one-in-three
chance of a move by Christmas. Investors have widened the odds
in recent weeks as Japan's quake and surging oil prices clouded
the outlook for global growth.	
 
 Yet the RBA played down the broader impact of the disaster
in Japan, saying it would have a limited impact on the Asian
region, which had been enjoying very strong growth.	
 ""My inclination is they still have a mild tightening bias
but at this stage don't see any great urgency to act on it,""
concluded Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.	
 ""The statement still emphasises terms of trade at the
highest level since the early 1950s, strength in national
income, strength in private investment and also confidence
production should return in the month ahead,"" he said.	
 The RBA led the developed world by hiking interest rates 175
basis points in seven steps from October 2009 to November 2010.
Some Asian nations have also been tightening to control
inflation and the European Central Bank this week is expected to
join the club with its first increase in almost three years.	
 
 CONSUMERS SAVE, MINERS SPEND	
 The RBA's pre-emptive policy seems to have worked well to
tame inflation and curb consumer demand.	
 Underlying inflation slowed to a decade-low around 2.25
percent in the final quarter of 2010 and there are signs it may
have subsided to the floor of the RBA's 2 to 3 percent target
band in the first quarter of this year.	
 ""These moderate outcomes are being assisted by the high
level of the exchange rate, the earlier decline in wages growth
and strong competition in some key markets,"" Stevens wrote.	
 Consumers have helped by spending less and saving the most
in almost two decades, forcing retailers to discount more
heavily. A rising local dollar has also played a part by pulling
down the cost of imported goods and offsetting higher petrol and
food prices.	
 Flooding across the state of Queensland is also proving a
drag on economic growth, at least in the short term. Treasurer
Wayne Swan last week estimated that the total costs of the dire
weather could reach A$9 billion, while a big hit to coal exports
would take a chunk out of tax revenues.	
Japan's earthquake was a further blow to Australia's
second-biggest export market, though spending on rebuilding
could generate greater demand for resources over the longer
term.	
 Still, the disruptions to supply coupled with robust Asian
growth have also led to record contract prices for coal and iron
ore, Australia's two biggest export earners.	
 This has proved a massive windfall for mining profits and
fuelled a stupendous pipeline of investment projects. Firms plan
to lift spending by a fifth to A$128 billion in the year to June
and then to A$160 billion in 2011/12, a huge boost to
Australia's A$1.3 trillion economy.	
 That is a major reason the RBA expects the economy to expand
at a rapid 4.25 percent pace for all of 2011, and grow around 4
percent in the following next two years.

eased to its weakest rate in six months in March, dragged down
by a slower pace of pick up in new business, data showed on
Tuesday.
 The HSBC purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the services
sector fell for the third month in a row, to 53.3 in March from
53.4 in February, heading further away from a seven-month peak
of 56.4 seen in December.
 The index, however, remained above the 50.0 mark that
separates expansion from contraction.
 ""Service sector drags overall economic growth, lagging
behind fast-growing manufacturing,"" said Alexander Morozov,
chief economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) at HSBC.
 ""The good news is that the service sector usually follows
the manufacturing trend with some time lag. If such a
relationship holds, one would expect the service sector to
improve its performance in the coming months.""
 Accompanying the relatively modest growth of activity, the
survey showed, was a slower rise in average input prices.
 But the data still leaves serious concerns about inflation.
 ""First, current levels of input and output prices indexes
are still high by historic standards,"" Morozov said.
 ""Second, the likely improvement in service sector
performance could intensify inflation.""
 Inflation remains one of the greatest problems plaguing
Russia's recovery from the financial crisis and is high on the
list voters' concerns ahead of parliamentary elections in
December and presidential elections next spring.
 The central bank decided in March to leave key interest
rates on hold and raise only minimum reserve requirements on
banks' liabilities, encouraged by small signs of easing
inflationary pressures.
 But prices have risen 3.7 percent so far this year, making
the government's official target of 6-7 inflation for the whole
of 2011 difficult to achieve.
 Analysts polled by Reuters at the end of last month raised
their inflation forecast to 9 percent from 8.5 percent seen
previously.

 It might also raise prices for peak-time power use to try to
balance out supply and demand, a trade ministry official, who
declined to be identified, said last week.	
 TEPCO estimates it can squeeze 54 gigawatts of supply out of
its network by summer, up from around 35 gigawatts now, by
rushing repairs on damaged thermal plants and by plugging
mothballed power stations back into the grid.	
 But that will still fall short of the 60 gigawatts of power
typically demanded during the summer peak months.	
 That means more rolling blackouts that will force Amauchi
and other corporate executives to find longer-term solutions.	
 
 ON YOUR OWN?	
 Konica Minolta , a maker of printers and high-tech
components, said that like Amauchi's company it was adjusting
workers' shifts to deal with the power disruption. It is also
increasing use of its own power generators and is lobbying
officials to adjust the blackout schedule to enable them to get
uninterrupted power for longer periods of time.	
 ""Based on the assumption a cap on total usage will be
implemented from summer to balance out supply and demand, I
believe companies will need to come up with a plan to meet its
target based on last year's peak usage and the expected cut
rate,"" CEO Masatoshi Matsuzaki told Reuters in an email.	
 The government has so far been preoccupied with disaster
relief and containing the nuclear crisis at TEPCO's Fukushima
Daiichi power plant, so has found little time to consider how it
will pay for reconstruction let alone manage the shortage of
power supply, adding to the uncertainty for company managers

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro hovered below a
five-month high against the dollar and an 11-month peak versus
the yen on Tuesday as investors assessed whether it can make
fresh gains given that expectations of interest rate rises have
been largely priced in. 
 The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates by a
quarter point from a record low of 1 percent at a meeting on
Thursday to rein in inflationary pressures, with two more 25
basis point hikes priced in by year-end .	
 But the single currency has already risen more than 6
percent against the dollar and more than 10 percent versus the
yen this year, making investors reluctant to buy more ahead of
the meeting this week.	
 The euro's rally has stalled right below resistance at its
November high of $1.4283. That level is also crucial as it
roughly coincides with trendline resistance drawn from the
euro's record high set in July 2008. 
 ""For the ECB, an April interest rate hike is a done deal and
one or two more hikes are priced in. It's hard to see a positive
surprise from here,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist
at Barclays Bank.	
 ""Still, the euro zone would be the first to raise interest
rates, which supports the euro. Expectations for diversification
flows from higher oil prices are also positive. There is also a
risk that the Fed minutes may show a hawkish tone.""	
 The euro fell 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday to
$1.4188 , pulling away from a five-month high of $1.4269
hit on Monday on trading platform EBS.	
 A rise above its November peak of $1.4283 could open the way
to $1.4374, the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's slide
from November 2009 to June 2010. Support is seen at $1.4190,
with traders citing stops through to below $1.4150. 
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 119.63 yen
, close to its 11-month peak of 120.073 yen hit on
Monday.	
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 84.32 yen , edging
closer to a six-month peak of 84.735 yen set on Friday. A
200-day moving average at around 83.55 is now seen acting as
support.	
 
 AUSSIE DIPS BEFORE RBA 
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.4 percent to $1.0323
, pressured by profit-taking in the wake of its rise to
a 29-year high of $1.0422 the previous day. There was talk of
both bids and stop-loss offers around $1.0300.	
 Investors were awaiting the Reserve Bank of Australia's
policy decision and statement later on Tuesday. The central bank
is seen likely to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent,
given scant signs of a pick up in underlying inflation.	
 A trader for a Japanese brokerage said market positioning
was tilted toward being long the Aussie dollar following its
recent rally, pointing to the potential for some downside risk.	
 Later on Tuesday, focus will turn to the Fed minutes for
more hints on the Fed's policy outlook. 
 Underscoring the market's focus on Fed speakers, the dollar
edged higher against the yen and the euro earlier on Tuesday,
following comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke.	
 Currency traders, however, said that the move in the dollar
likely was due to the market having been short the dollar rather
than anything else.	
 Bernanke said a recent pick-up in U.S. inflation was driven
primarily by rising commodity prices globally, but added that
was unlikely to persist. [ID:nN04294041]	
 After a string of hawkish comments from Fed officials, some
U.S. central bankers have struck a more cautious tone. 
 On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said U.S.
inflation was likely to remain moderate and St.
Louis Fed Research Director Christopher Waller said the Fed was
likely to buy all the bonds it has said it would purchase by

 By Rie Ishiguro	
 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Japan plans to seek continued
cooperation from the Group of Seven countries at a meeting this
month, Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Tuesday, after
joint G7 currency intervention last month to halt yen strength
in the wake of a devastating earthquake.	
 ""After the joint intervention by the G7, I want to express
gratitude and seek continued cooperation,"" Noda told a news
conference after a cabinet meeting.	
 G7 sources told Reuters on Monday that finance chiefs from
the group will meet in Washington on April 14 with the economic
impact of Japan's triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis high on their agenda. [ID:nN04252436]	
 ""The nuclear power problem is ongoing but I want to explain

the quake, and the country's current situation,"" Noda said.	
 The G7 groups the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada and Japan. They would meet just ahead of a
scheduled April 15 gathering of officials from the wider group
of G20 nations, which also includes emerging-market powers such
as China, India and Brazil. 
 The G7 countries carried out a rare coordinated intervention
in the currency markets on March 18 after the yen shot up to a
record high of 76.25 to the dollar, on speculation that Japanese
investors were repatriating overseas funds after the earthquake
and tsunami devastated Japan's northeast coast.	
 Japan's economy is expected to suffer hundreds of billions
of dollars in damage from the disasters, which have also
disrupted global supply lines for products from cars to
electronics.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - Base and precious metals
prices rose and oil hovered near two-and-a-half year highs on
Tuesday, dragging on Asian shares as investors worried rising
commodities prices could erode corporate profit margins.	
 The euro edged off a five-month high against the dollar,
with traders saying a widely expected euro zone interest rate
rise later this week was already factored in.	
 Asian stocks fell, although shares in resources companies
bucked the trend, but higher commodities prices also stoked
worries about global inflationary pressures, pushing silver to a
31-year high.	
 Major European equity markets were seen opening flat,
financial bookmakers said, while S&P 500 futures  were
down 0.2 percent, pointing to a weaker start on Wall Street.	
 The European Central Bank is seen as certain to bump up on
Thursday its key interest rate by 25 basis points from a record
low 1 percent to curb price pressures, with investors expecting
further tightening before the end of the year .	
 ""For the ECB, an April interest rate hike is a done deal and
one or two more hikes are priced in,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief FX strategist at Barclays Bank.	
 
 A euro zone rate rise will widen the yield advantage enjoyed
by the single currency over the dollar, against which it has
appreciated more than 6 percent so far this year.	
 The Federal Reserve's intentions appear more finely judged,
and investors will keenly parse the minutes of its last meeting,
due later in the day, for signals on the timing of the U.S.
central bank's exit from its current ultra-loose policy stance.	
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech that a recent
increase in U.S. inflation was driven primarily by commodity
prices and unlikely to persist, although he added that the Fed
would monitor inflation expectations very closely.
[ID:nN04294041]	
 The euro sat around $1.4195 , off a five-month high of
$1.4268 reached on Monday. The single currency was up a touch
around 119.75 yen , after breaching 120 yen on Monday
for the first time in nearly a year. 
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 84.35 yen , edging
closer to a six-month peak of 84.735 yen set on Friday.	
 
 SHARES DOWN	
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 1.1 percent with
investors still unsure of the long-term impact of last month's
massive earthquake and tsunami and a resulting nuclear accident
that workers are still struggling to contain. 
 The Tokyo market has recouped about two-thirds of its plunge
in the days immediately following the disaster, but remains
around 6 percent below its close on March 11, the day the quake
struck northeastern Japan.	
 ""There was a sharp drop in the Nikkei and we've seen a swift
rebound,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.	
 ""That's normal. But from now on people will start pricing in
fundamentals and that will push the market gradually lower, so
we'll see more moves like today in the coming weeks.""	
 MSCI's broadest measure of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was little changed, with its materials sub-index
, which rose 0.4 percent, the only component in
positive territory.	
 Australia's resource-heavy benchmark index gained
rose 0.3 percent to a six-week high, while South Korean stocks
shrugged off early weakness to end up 0.7 percent at a
new record high as foreign investors snapped up shares in Seoul
for a 15th consecutive session.	
 Markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for
holidays.	
 U.S. stocks finished flat on Monday, with the volume of
shares traded at its lowest this year. 
 After the closing bell on Wall Street, Texas Instruments Inc
said it planned to buy smaller rival National
Semiconductor for about $6.5 billion in one of the
microchip industry's largest deals in years, but news of the
deal did little to lift Asian tech shares. [ID:nN04281619]	
 U.S. crude futures  inched down 0.3 percent to $108.19
a barrel, while Brent crude  was little changed at just
under $121 a barrel. 
 Brent surged more than $2 on Monday as Nigerian election
delays and a short-lived strike in Gabon added to the supply
jitters of a market already on edge over fighting in Libya and
unrest in Yemen, which borders top producer Saudi Arabia.	
 Silver rose to $38.72 an ounce, its highest since
early 1980, while gold was little changed around
$1,436.70 an ounce. 
 Base metals rose by 0.4 percent on average, led by copper,
with three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange up
$79 to $9,409 a tonne. 
 ""The expectation of growing consumption globally, as well as
the supply picture, will lend strong support for copper prices,""
Liu Xiangming, vice president and executive director of Aluminum
Corporation of China (Chinalco), said at the Asia Mining
Conference in Singapore.

 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro held below this week's
five-month high against the dollar and 11-month peak versus the
yen on Tuesday as investors paused to assess how much it can
make in fresh gains given that expectations for interest rate
rises have largely been priced in.	
 The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest
rates by a quarter point from a record low of 1 percent at its

 But the single currency has already risen more than six

 Uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy also prompted
investors to stay on the sidelines ahead of the release of the

 The euro stood at $1.4228 , having risen to a high
around $1.4268 on Monday. A rise above resistance at $1.4281,
the November high, would open the way to $1.4450. Support is
seen at $1.4190, with traders citing stops through to below
$1.4150.	
 Traders also noted trendline resistance drawn from the
euro's record high set in July 2008 coming in around $1.4300. 
 The euro was up around 0.2 percent at 119.76 yen ,
close to its 11-month peak above 120.05 hit on Monday.	
 The dollar ticked higher to 84.19 yen , edging closer
to a six-month peak of 84.72 set on Friday before stalling ahead
of option barriers at 84.75. A 200-day moving average at around
83.55 is now seen acting as support.	
 
 FED POLICY	
 Investors are focusing on the Fed minutes to give more clues
on the future direction of monetary policy after policymakers
suggested on Monday the Fed is likely to keep its $600 billion
asset purchase programme until June.	
 On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said U.S.
inflation was likely to remain moderate and St.
Louis Fed Research Director Christopher Waller said the Fed was
likely to buy all the bonds it has said it would purchase by

 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment and keep policy ultra-loose on Wednesday, a factor
that is keeping the yen under pressure.

(Updates to close)
 TORONTO, April 4 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar eased from
three-year highs against the U.S. dollar on Monday, breaking a
five-day rising streak, as market players mulled where next to
take the commodity-linked currency.
 Backed by oil prices sitting at peaks not seen since 2008,
the Canadian dollar  reached as high as C$0.9616 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.0400, its strongest level since November
2007. It later eased back below Friday's close, where it spent
most of the afternoon in a 20-point range.
 ""Basically, markets are taking a break from the volatility
we've seen in the last couple of weeks. But oil prices continue
to provide strength and support in the short-term,"" said Darren
Richardson, corporate dealer at CanadianForex.
 The currency finished at C$0.9675 to the U.S. dollar, or
$1.0336, down from Friday's North American finish of C$0.9644
to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0369.
 Merger and acquisition activity also helped to buoy the
currency. China's Minmetals Resources <1208.HK>, the country's
biggest metals trading firm, offered C$6.3 billion to buy
Canadian-listed copper producer Equinox Minerals .
 The Bank of Canada's first-quarter business outlook survey
showed companies maintained a positive outlook on the economy,
although sentiment on some forward-looking indicators, such as
future sales growth, have eased from previous surveys.
 Mounting price pressures from rising energy and food costs
are also expected to lift consumer inflation toward the upper
end of the central bank's comfort zone, the survey showed.
 This could push the central bank to raise its key interest
rate by mid-year as it seeks to keep inflation at the center of
its 1-3 percent target range.
 However, swap markets continue to maintain bets that there
is almost no chance the central bank will raise rates in April.
Odds of a May hike are also seen as low. The probability of a
September rate hike is fully priced in. 
 Still, the currency's technical picture remains somewhat
uncertain, given that there are few notable levels for the
currency between its current mark and its modern-day high of
C$0.9059, or US$1.1039, reached in November 2007, according to
Thomson Reuters dealing data.
 BONDS HIGHER
 Canadian bond prices were higher across the curve, rising
after a string of down sessions. There were few economic
releases to provide direction, but market players were on guard
for several U.S. Federal officials to speak in coming sessions,
including Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday night.
 Markets have been absorbing hawkish talk from some central
bankers recently, which has brought forward expectations for
when U.S. interest rates might be increased.
 Canada's two-year bond  rose 4 Canadian cents to
yield 1.811 percent, while the 10-year bond  rose 9
Canadian cents to yield 3.356 percent.

 WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund supports Greece's wishes to avoid a debt restructuring,
the head of the IMF said on Monday.
 In his first comments since a German magazine reported at
the weekend that the IMF was quietly pushing Athens to
restructure its debt, IMF Managing Director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn dismissed the report.
 ""We are supporting the Greek government in its position
that it doesn't want a restructuring of the debt...""
Strauss-Kahn told students at George Washington University.
 He said the challenge for Greece was to make its economy
more competitive and restructuring the country's debt would not
resolve that issue.
 ""To restore growth in Greece, you have to restore
competitiveness. That is the real problem and what we've tried
to address,"" he added.
 Greece is implementing tough austerity measures and
structural reforms in exchange for a 110 billion euro ($155.4
billion) rescue loan from the EU and the IMF.
 But the IMF chief acknowledged that Greece could have been
in a better situation if the IMF and the European Union were
able to help earlier as the country battled a debt crisis last
year.
 ""But for governance problems, political problems within the
European Union, it took more time than necessary and of course,
the later you do what you have to do the worse it is,""
Strauss-Kahn said.

 By Moises Avila and Michael O'Boyle
 SANTIAGO/MEXICO CITY, April 4 (Reuters) - Chile's peso hit
a one-month high on Monday, after the country's central bank
said it would keep raising interest rates, while Brazil's real
dipped after last week's rally despite a debt ratings upgrade.
 Chile's central bank raised its inflation forecast for 2011
to 4.3 percent in a quarterly report and said it would continue
to raise borrowing costs after lifting its key lending rate to
4 percent last month. For more, see: [ID:nN04237988]
 The attraction of higher interest rates in Chile is seen
supporting the currency , which firmed 0.19 percent to
474.60 per dollar.
 ""The market is going to keep probing new lows for the
dollar,"" said Rodrigo Sarria, a trader at Celfin Capital.
 However, rising crude prices could weigh on Chile, which
imports most of its oil. Low reservoirs could force Chile to
ration hydro-electric energy, which, combined with higher oil
prices, could put pressure on the currency. [ID:nN04270880]
 Brazil's real  bid a slight 0.06 percent weaker at
1.611 per dollar on local spot markets, pulling back from its
strongest levels since August 2008 hit earlier in the session.
 The real surged nearly 3 percent last week. Last Wednesday,
the Brazilian currency broke past the key 1.65 per dollar level
the government had been seen defending.
 Brazilian officials told Reuters last week they have ruled
out imposing severe capital controls for now and analysts think
the authorities are seeing a somewhat stronger real as an aid
in the central bank's fight against inflation. [ID:nN01172691]
 Supporting the currency, Fitch upgraded Brazil's credit
ratings by one notch on Monday, saying the country's potential
economic growth has increased while the new government of Dilma
Rousseff has shown greater fiscal restraint. [ID:nN04265221]
 Analysts expect the currency could stake out a new range
between 1.60 and 1.65 per dollar as the central bank uses its
tool box of auctions in the spot, forwards and derivatives
markets to try and slow the currency's advance.
 ""Of course, (the ratings upgrade) could reinforce inflows,
but on the other hand you have the government trying to hold
back this excess,"" said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank.
 Mexico's peso  dipped 0.19 percent to 11.86230, but
still managed to stake out a fresh high at 11.82 per dollar
that was its strongest level since October 2008.
 The peso has benefited from signs of an improving economic
recovery in the United States, Mexico's top trading partner, as
well as expectations Mexican authorities will not increase
their current pace of building dollar reserves.
 BNP Paribas economists revised their outlook for the
Mexican peso and now expect the currency to firm to 11.30 per
dollar by the end of the year.
 Last Friday's U.S. monthly employment report was seen as
solid enough to keep up confidence in the economic recovery of
the United States, but not strong enough to discourage the
Federal Reserve from its ultra-easy monetary policies that have
increased the allure of higher-yielding Latin American debt.
 Peru's sol  bid 0.14 percent weaker at 2.8090 per
dollar after two polls published Sunday showed left-wing
nationalist Ollanta Humala had widened his lead in Peru's
presidential race one week before the election. [ID:nN03302016]
 The sol has slumped around 1.5 percent since March 18 as
Humala took the lead in the race and the currency hit its
lowest since December last week.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
five-month peak against the dollar and an 11-month high against
the yen on Monday, with near-term strength seen limited as an
expected euro zone interest rate rise was mostly priced in.
 The European Central Bank, at its policy meeting on
Thursday, is widely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points
from a record low to battle rising inflationary pressures in
the euro zone. Two more 25-basis-point rate hikes are factored
in by year-end. 
 Traders expect the euro to stay near current levels in the
coming days, with resistance seen around $1.4281, the November
high. The single currency could struggle to extend gains unless
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sounds a surprisingly hawkish
tone on inflation, analysts said.
 ""Market participants will likely remain reluctant to push
too hard on the short side of the euro ahead of the European
Central Bank rate decision,"" said Dan Cook, chief executive of
IG Markets in Chicago.
 ""Once the unknown becomes known, the question becomes 'How
long can 25 basis points remain supportive or do we face a
situation of a quick relief rally that is followed by a rapid
sell-off as market focus returns to sovereign debt?'"" he said.
 The euro  last traded at $1.4217, down 0.1 percent.
Bids from Asian central banks and other investors are likely to
offer the euro solid support at $1.4190, with traders citing
stops through to below $1.4150.
 Traders also noted trendline resistance drawn from the
euro's record high set in July 2008 coming in around $1.4300.
 Investors were in a wait-and-see stance, with a number of
central bank rate decisions in the developed world and a slew
of speakers from the U.S. Federal Reserve later in the week.
 The euro rose above 120 yen  for the first time
since May 2010 and was last at 119.47, down 0.1 percent.
 The dollar was flat at 84.03 yen . It hit its highest
level since September on Friday on trading platform EBS,
stalling ahead of an option barrier at 84.75.
 The pair rose above its 200-day moving average last week,
signaling the downtrend may have run its course.
 Dollar/yen's ""inability to close above the December 2010
high on Friday at 84.51 and the failure to get above that level
today are leading to profit-taking and modest selling for the
pair,"" said Greg Michalowski, chief currency analyst at FXDD.
 ""The market is also concerned that perhaps the Fed may not
be so quick to change their policy course toward less
accommodation.""
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was scheduled to speak later on
Monday. Recent Fed official comments have highlighted
divergence and uncertainty over the outlook for U.S. monetary
policy.
 Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday that
while U.S. inflation is likely to remain low for now,
policymakers will keep a close eye on potentially
self-fulfilling consumer expectations of higher prices.
 The yen hovered near recent lows against higher-yielding
currencies such as the Australian dollar. Expectations of low
Japanese rates have encouraged investors to borrow in yen and
reinvest in higher-yielding assets in the so-called carry
trades.
 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment and keep policy ultra-loose on Wednesday.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2011 04:04PM ET</span>",GlobeOp indexes to shed light on hedge fund flows," * Data to track 8-10 percent of global hedge fund industry
 * Indexes to show actual and expected capital flows
 
 LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - GlobeOp Financial Services is
launching two new indexes tracking capital flows of a tenth of
the world's hedge funds, putting one of the most opaque segments
of the asset management industry under the microscope.
 GlobeOp will publish monthly reports based on actual and
expected capital movement data gathered from all funds it
provides administration services to, providing regular and
independent insight into the mood of hedge fund investors.
 ""There is a real lack of independently confirmed industry
data against which hedge fund managers and investors can
benchmark their allocations and performance,"" Hans Hufschmid,
chief executive of the hedge fund services company, said on
Monday.
 ""We summarise aggregate subscription, redemption and
performance figures for our clients' funds. It was therefore a
logical next step to ... repackage a subset of this data into
consistent, timely indices focused on capital movements.""
 While hedge fund investors tend to make rapid decisions on
investment strategies in volatile markets, operators of the
funds they move money in and out of are often reluctant to
reveal the size or the direction of net flows.
 Investors pulled more than $280 billion net from hedge funds
in 2008 and 2009 as clients reacted to the collapse of Lehman
Brothers and subsequent financial sector turmoil, according to
Hedge Fund Research, which also provides data on flows.
 The GlobeOp Capital Movement Index consists of cumulative
monthly net of subscriptions to, and redemptions from, hedge
funds administered by London-listed GlobeOp, divided by those
clients' total assets under administration (AuA).
 The second index is called the GlobeOp Forward Redemptions
Indicator and consists of redemption notices received from hedge
funds administered by GlobeOp, again divided by total AuA.
 GlobeOp's total AuA represent 8-10 percent of the estimated
assets currently invested in the global hedge fund sector. The
investment strategies of the funds tracked by the index span a
representative industry sample, the company said.
 ""Because data is calculated ... at the same point in time
and using consistent mathematical methodology, the
self-selection and self-reporting biases of many other indices
are eliminated,"" GlobeOp managing director Tony Glickman said,
referring to possible flaws in indexes which rely on funds to
supply data.
 ""In addition, because data is reported within days of the
business month-end close, the delay factor inherent in some
other indices is eliminated,"" he said.
 The GlobeOp Capital Movement Index is due for publication on
April 12, with the GlobeOp Forward Redemptions Indicator due on
April 21.

 NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Commodities rose on Monday as
Brent crude topped $120 a barrel on concerns over the impact on
supply from unrest in the Middle East, while corn surged to
match a record-high price set during the 2008 global food
crisis.
 Merger and acquisition activity helped global equities eke
out gains. Wall Street was little changed, as the broad S&P 500
<.SPX> struggled to break above its high for the year ahead of
the quarterly earnings season that kicks off next week.
 Expectations of higher euro zone interest rates took the
euro briefly to an 11-month high against the Japanese yen,
before easing back with expectations of an increase already
priced in.
 Brent crude oil prices rose above $120 a barrel to the
highest level since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and
the global financial crisis in September 2008. After choppy
trading, U.S. crude settled up 53 cents at $108.47 a barrel,
the highest close since September 2008.
 Libya's continuing conflict and unrest in Yemen could pose
threats to supply in the Middle East, while investors expect
demand for oil could grow on signs of improvement in the U.S.
economy.
 Corn futures extended a rally that began last week when the
U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged quarterly corn stocks as
of March 1 at levels well below trade expectations, with
tightening supply underscoring the strong demand for the feed
grain. For details, see [ID:nLDE7300TD]
 ""There are no signs saying corn won't go higher. Stocks
were bullish for corn and now planting weather doesn't look
good,"" said Mario Balletto, analyst for Citigroup.
 Earlier in the day, spot corn equaled its record high of
$7.65 per bushel set on June 27, 2008. Chicago Board of Trade
corn futures unofficially ended up at $7.59.
 EQUITIES STRUGGLE
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up

was slightly lower in the early afternoon, hovering just under
1,333, a level that it has been unable to close above since
mid-February.
 The S&P recorded its best two-week period since December on
Friday and the Dow industrials <.DJI> hit the highest intraday

 Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global
Asset Management in Boston, said the earnings season would
likely push the S&P 500 to 1,400 by mid-May as stocks come off
the seasonally strong November-April period.
 ""If we make a successful break from here, I think you've
got the 1,400 range and I think that's probably likely during
the final seasonally favorable push,"" Zaro said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro edged lower on
Monday after hitting a five-month peak against the U.S. dollar
and an 11-month high against the yen, with near-term strength
seen limited as an expected euro zone interest rate rise was
mostly priced in.
 The European Central Bank, at its policy meeting on
Thursday, is widely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points
from a record low to battle rising inflationary pressures in
the euro zone. Two more 25-basis-point rate hikes are factored
in by year-end.
 Traders expect the euro to stay near current levels in the
coming days, with resistance seen around $1.4281, the November
high. The single currency could struggle to extend gains unless
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sounds a surprisingly hawkish
tone on inflation, analysts said.
 ""Market participants will likely remain reluctant to push
too hard on the short side of the euro ahead of the European
Central Bank rate decision,"" said Dan Cook, chief executive of
IG Markets in Chicago.
 ""Once the unknown becomes known, the question becomes how
long can 25 basis points remain supportive or do we face a
situation of a quick relief rally that is followed by a rapid
sell-off as market focus returns to sovereign debt?"" he said.
 The euro last traded at $1.4207, down 0.2 percent. Bids
from Asian central banks and other investors are likely to
offer the euro solid support at $1.4190, with traders citing
stops through to below $1.4150.
 Technical analysts also highlighted trendline resistance
drawn from the euro's record high struck in July 2008 coming in
around $1.4300.
 Risks abound this week, including a number of central bank
rate decisions in the developed world and a slew of speakers
from the U.S. Federal Reserve that could result in investors
adopting a wait-and-see stance.
 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment and keep policy ultra-loose on Wednesday, while
comments from Federal Reserve officials highlighted divergence
and uncertainty over the need to tighten monetary policy in the
United States.
 The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the first time
since May 2010 but retreated to 119.29, down 0.3 percent on the
day.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 83.99. It
had hit its highest level since September on Friday on trading
platform EBS, stalling ahead of an option barrier at 84.75.
Traders reported good interest to sell dollars into the 85.00
area.
 It rose above its 200-day moving average last week, in a
sign that the downtrend against the yen may have run its
course.
 Better-than-expected U.S. employment data on Friday,
hinting at a stronger recovery and the possibility for higher
U.S. rates, gave the greenback some support.
 The pair will be sensitive to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke,
who is scheduled to speak later on Monday.
 The dollar fell to session lows against the yen after
Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that while U.S.
inflation is likely to remain low for now, policymakers will
keep a close eye on potentially self-fulfilling consumer
expectations for higher prices.
 William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, on Friday blunted the hawkish tone of some other Fed
officials worried about inflation, saying he saw no need for
the central bank to reverse course.
 Dollar/yen's ""inability to close above the December 2010
high on Friday at 84.51 and the failure to get above that level
today are leading to profit taking and modest selling for the
pair,"" said Greg Michalowski, chief currency analyst at FXDD.
""The market is also concerned that perhaps the Fed may not be

The yen hovered near recent lows against higher-yielding
currencies such as the Australian dollar. Expectations of low
Japanese rates have encouraged investors to borrow in yen and
reinvest in higher-yielding assets in the so-called carry
trades.
 The Australian dollar again traded to its highest since
being freely floated in 1983. It slipped back to trade at
1.0349, down 0.4 percent on the day.

 * Italy also advances after 2009 drop

By Robert Evans
 GENEVA, April 4 (Reuters) - China increased the number of
trademarks it filed through an 85-nation international
registration system by a massive 42 percent last year, the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) reported on Monday.
 But European countries, with Germany in first place,
dominated the 2010 rankings, allowing only the United States
into the first five and China, Japan and Russia into the top 10,
WIPO figures showed.
 Reflecting a recovery from the global financial and economic
crisis of 2008-09, overall filings through the United Nations
agency's system rose by 12.8 percent after a 16 percent drop the
previous year.
 ""International trademark activity has rebounded and has
nearly recovered the ground lost in 2009,"" commented WIPO
Director General Francis Gurry.
 China's 1,928 applications across a wide range of industrial
activity, accounting for 4.9 percent of all filings, marked a
sharp turnaround from the previous year when amid the global
downturn its applications dropped by 14.3 percent against 2008.
 U.S. filings were also up sharply last year, by 29.6 percent
for a total of 4,147, putting the United States in third place
among applicants after Germany -- with 5,006 -- and the European
Union's common trademark office with 4,707.
 WIPO officials say trademark applications reflect the
introduction of new products and services to the market and are
sensitive to business cycles. In a downturn, they say, consumers
opt for tried and trusted brands and products.
 Larger countries in the 27-nation European Union file to
WIPO through their own national systems but taken together with
those filed through the EU office accounted, with a total of
22,403 applications, for more than half the global total.
 Germany, the world's largest single trading nation, filed
12.6 percent of the global total but with a growth of only 4.4
percent over 2009.
 Applications channeled through the EU's Office of
Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) accounted for just
under 12 percent of the global total with a hefty growth of 27
percent, according to the WIPO figures.
 France, which saw a decline of 16.5 percent in 2009, only
boosted filings by just over 1 percent last year, ceding its
third place in the league table to the United States.
 But Italy, after reducing applications by 32.2 percent in
2009 against 2008, rebounded in 2010 to a growth of 38.7
percent, retaining 7th place with a total of 6.5 percent of
world filings.
 Japan, which bucked the trend in 2009 when it saw a growth
of 2.7 percent, increased its total further by 20.2 percent,
while Russia, after a decline of 10.3 percent in 2009, picked up
by 14 percent to increase filings by 4 percent.
 The biggest percentage increase -- although from a low base
-- was notched up by South Korea which boosted filings by a
whopping 42.2 percent. But at 17th place in the table, it
accounted for just under 1 percent of the world total.

 * Fukushima politicians meet PM Kan to demand compensation
(Adds India imposes blanket ban on food imports from Japan)	
 By Mayumi Negishi and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The operator of Japan's crippled
nuclear power plant said on Tuesday it had found water with 5
million times the legal limit of radioactivity inside a reactor
as it struggles for a fourth week to contain the world's biggest
nuclear disaster in quarter of a century.	
 Underlining the concern over spreading radiation, the
government said it was considering imposing radioactivity
restrictions on seafood for the first time in the crisis after
contaminated fish were found in seas well south of the damaged
nuclear reactors.	
The plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co
(TEPCO) offered token ""condolence"" money to those
affected in the Fukushima region where the plant is based, but
the local mayors who came to Tokyo to meet Prime Minister Naoto
Kan made clear they expected far more help.	
 ""We have borne the risks, co-existed and flourished with
TEPCO for more than 40 years, and all these years, we have fully
trusted the myth that nuclear plants are absolutely safe,""
said Katsuya Endo, the mayor of Tomioka town.	
 He was one of eight Fukushima prefecture mayors who went to
Kan to demand compensation and support for employment, housing
and education for the tens of thousands of people evacuated as a
result of the radiation crisis . 
 
 In desperation, engineers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant
have turned to what are little more than home remedies to stem
the flow of contaminated water. On Tuesday, they used ""liquid
glass"" in the hope of plugging cracks in a leaking concrete pit.	
 ""We tried pouring sawdust, newspaper and concrete mixtures
into the side of the pit (leading to tunnels outside reactor
No.2), but the mixture does not seem to be entering the cracks,""
said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of Japan's
Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA).	
 ""We also still do not know how the highly contaminated water
is seeping out of reactor No.2,"" said Nishiyama.	
 TEPCO said it suspected that a stone layer beneath the
trench feeding into the pit at reactor No. 2 might be the source
of the contaminated water, but added they were still
investigating the exact causes and were prepared for the
possibility that there were other sources of radioactive water.	
 Engineers also plan to build two giant polyester
""silt curtains"" in the sea to block the spread of more
contamination from the plant. 
 Workers are still struggling to restart cooling pumps --
which recycle the water -- in four reactors damaged by last
month's 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami. 
 Until those are fixed, they must pump in water from outside
to prevent overheating and meltdowns. In the process, that
creates more contaminated water that has to be pumped out and
stored somewhere else or released into the sea.	
 There is a total of 60,000 tonnes of highly contaminated
water in the plant after workers frantically poured in seawater
when fuel rods experienced partial meltdown after the tsunami
hit northeast Japan on March 11.	
 TEPCO on Monday had to start releasing 11,500 tonnes of
low-level radioactive seawater after it ran out of storage
capacity for more highly contaminated water. The release will
continue until Friday.

 FIVE MILLION TIMES LEGAL LIMIT	
 Radioactive iodine of up to 4,800 times the legal limit has
been recorded in the sea near the plant. Caesium was found at
levels above safety limits in tiny ""kounago"" fish in waters off
Ibaraki Prefecture, south of Fukushima, local media reported.	
 Iodine-131 in the water near the sluice gate of reactor No.
2 hit a high on April 2 of 7.5 million times the legal limit.
The water, which was not released into the ocean, fell to 5
million times the legal limit on Monday.	
 TEPCO said it had started paying token ""condolence
money"" to local governments to aid people evacuated from around
its stricken plant or affected by the radiation crisis.	
 It faces a huge bill for the damage caused by its crippled
reactors, but said it must first assess the extent of damage
before paying actual compensation.	
 ""We are still in discussion as to what extent we will pay on
our own and to what extent we will have assistance from the
government,"" TEPCO executive vice-president Takashi Fujimotohe
told a news conference.	
 TEPCO offered just 20 million yen ($238,000) in condolence
money each to towns near the reactors whose residents were
forced to evacuate. A second TEPCO official said they offered
that sum to 10 towns but one refused to take the money.	
 
 FISH PRICES TUMBLE	
 Fishermen from neighbouring Ibaraki prefecture saw prices
for flounder and sea bream tumble as buyers shunned their catch.	
 ""Unless problems at the plant end soon, fishermen won't be
able to go on living without compensation. We want compensation
from TEPCO, the government and the prefecture,"" said Hikaru
Sugiyama a fishing cooperative official in Ibaraki.	
 India on Tuesday announced a three-month ban on imports of
processed foods, fruits and vegetables from the whole of Japan,
becoming the first country to introduce a blanket ban. 
 ""After detailed discussions, it was concluded that since the
radiation is spreading/expanding horizontally in other parts of
Japan, it may result in further radioactive contamination in the
supply chain of food exports from Japan,"" a statement from the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said. 
 TEPCO's shares plunged to a record low of 363 yen on Tuesday
on uncertainty over the nuclear crisis, and are now over 80
percent of their value before the quake struck.	
 The quake and tsunami have left nearly 28,000 people dead or
missing, thousands homeless and Japan's northeast coast a wreck.	
 The world's costliest natural disaster has caused power
blackouts and cuts to supply chains, threatening Japan's
economic growth and the operations of global firms from
semiconductor makers to shipbuilders.	
 Fujimoto said TEPCO wants to avoid having to impose rolling
power blackouts in summer, when demand surges due to heavy use
of air-conditioning. Analysts say blackouts could cause the
biggest economic damage to Japan.[ID:TFD006728]

893,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2011 12:24PM ET</span>","UPDATE 2-Fitch upgrades Brazil on growth, spending cuts"," 
 * Fitch first to raise Brazil to BBB, outlook stable
 * Fitch sees higher potential growth, fiscal restraint
 * Moody's may upgrade Brazil soon, S&P has stable outlook
(Recasts, adds analyst comment, market reaction)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Fitch on Monday upgraded
Brazil's credit ratings by one notch, saying Latin America's
largest economy, once a chronic underperformer, has expanded
its potential for growth.
 The upgrade underscores the increasing importance of
Brazil's economy on the world stage, even as many developed
nations continue to struggle, in some cases seeing their own
ratings tumble.
 The move means Brazil's rating from Fitch is now one notch
higher than Portugal's as a sovereign debt crisis among several
euro zone nations has roiled markets for more than a year. For
more, see: [ID:nWNA5226]
 Fitch singled out spending cuts promised by new President
Dilma Rousseff that would shave $30 billion off the country's
budget. Public spending bloated last year ahead of October's
presidential elections in what many analysts called a bid to
boost Rousseff's candidacy.
 Rousseff won -- but she also inherited a fiscal mess from
her mentor and predecessor, former President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva.
 ""The hard part now will be going beyond this,"" said Flavio
Serrano, a senior economist with Espirito Santo Investment
Bank. ""This challenge, of an upgrade, has to be met on the
fiscal side. The government has to implement a more rigorous
fiscal policy.""
 The government's free spending has pressured inflation and
interest rates. That, in turn, indirectly contributed to a
worrisome currency rally as yield-chasing investors have poured
money into Brazil.
 The Fitch upgrade could spur further inflows, the country's
finance minister, Guido Mantega, said on Monday.
 ""It's true, the more solid the Brazilian economy is the
more it tends to attract foreign investments in dollars, which
at the moment is a problem,"" he said.
 ""But it's better to have this problem, of excess dollars,
than the problem we had in the past, a lack of dollars,"" he
said. ""The government will keep taking measures to contain the
excess dollars.""
 Brazil's currency, the real , strengthened 0.06
percent to 1.609 per dollar in the afternoon. Brazil's
benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> briefly accelerated gains
on the news.
 Analysts see Brazil's economy growing 4.0 percent this
year, according to a weekly central bank survey of local
economists. [ID:nN04241036]
 While that's a slowdown from the brisk 7.5 percent pace of
last year, it's still likely good enough to make Brazil a
better performer than most other major economies this year.
 Fitch estimates the sustainable potential growth rate of
the Brazilian economy has increased to 4 to 5 percent, which
should support the medium-term fiscal outlook and the continued
strengthening of the country's external liquidity position.
 Fitch raised Brazil's foreign- and local-currency issuer
ratings to BBB from BBB-minus. It was the first among the
big-three ratings agencies to upgrade the country to the
second-lowest level of investment grade. The outlook on the new
ratings is stable.
 Moody's has also said it may upgrade Brazil before summer,
while Standard & Poor's still has the country at BBB-minus with
a stable outlook. Both agencies currently have Brazil at the
lowest investment-grade level.

894,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2011 12:24PM ET</span>",FOREX-Euro eases from peaks; ECB hikes now priced in," * Euro slips after hitting 5-month high vs dollar
 * Single currency eases from 11-month high vs yen
 * ECB rate-hike expectations may be fully priced
(Adds quote, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro fell from 11-month
highs against the yen on Monday and a five-month peak against
the dollar with any gains seen muted as expectations of an
increase in euro-zone interest rates this week are fully
priced in.
The European Central Bank, at its policy meeting on
Thursday, is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points from a
record low in reaction to rising inflationary pressures in the
euro zone. Two more 25-basis-point rate hikes are factored in
by year-end.
 Bids from Asian central banks and other investors are
likely to offer the euro solid support at $1.4190 against the
dollar, with traders citing stops through to below $1.4150.
 Analysts said event risks abound this week, including a
number of central bank rate decisions in the developed world
and a slew of speakers from the U.S. Federal Reserve, that
could result in investors adopting a wait-and-see stance.
 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment and keep policy ultra-loose on Wednesday, while
comments from a senior Federal Reserve official on Friday
highlighted divergence and uncertainty over the need to
tighten monetary policy in the United States.
 ""It's difficult to sell the euro going into Thursday's ECB
meeting,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""But there is
limited upside and we would need to hear surprisingly hawkish
comment from ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet for a
sustainable move higher in the euro.""
 The euro stalled ahead of its November 2010 high as
resistance around $1.4281 loomed. It was last at $1.4223, down
0.04 percent.
 Technical analysts also highlighted trendline resistance
drawn from the euro's record high struck in July 2008 coming
in around $1.4300.
 The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the first time
since May 2010 but retreated to 119.50, down 0.1 percent from
late U.S. trade on Friday.
 One of the Federal Reserve's most powerful policymakers,
William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, on Friday went against an increasingly hawkish tone from
some other Fed officials worried about inflation, saying he
saw no need for the central bank to reverse course.
 FED POLICY DIVERGENCE
 Better-than-expected U.S. employment data on Friday,
hinting at a stronger recovery and the possibility for higher
U.S. rates, gave the greenback some support.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 83.98 yen.
It had hit its highest level since September on Friday on
trading platform EBS, stalling ahead of an option barrier at
84.75. Traders reported good interest to sell dollars into the
85.00 area.
 It rose above its 200-day moving average last week, in a
sign that the downtrend against the yen may have run its
course.
 The pair will be sensitive to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke,
who is scheduled to speak later today.
 The dollar fell to session lows against the yen after
Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said at a business
conference on Monday that while U.S. inflation is likely to
remain low for now, policymakers will keep a close eye on
potentially self-fulfilling consumer expectations for higher
prices.
 Last week, hawkish comments from a number of Fed
policymakers helped the dollar rebound on the yen, before it
ran out of steam following Dudley's dovish comments.
 Dollar/yen ""inability to close above the December 2010
high on Friday at 84.51 and the failure to get above that
level today, is leading to profit taking and modest selling
for the pair,"" said Greg Michalowski, chief currency analyst
at FXDD. ""The market is also concerned that perhaps the Fed
may not be so quick to change their policy course toward less
accommodation.""
The yen hovered near recent lows on the crosses,
particularly against higher-yielding currencies like the
Australian dollar.
 The Australian dollar again traded to its highest since
being freely floated in 1983. It slipped back to trade at
1.0348, down 0.4 percent on the day.

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Merger and acquisition
activity helped buoy global equities on Monday, but gains were
kept in check after recent highs, while expectations of higher
euro zone interest rates took the euro briefly to an 11-month
high against Japan's yen.
 Brent crude oil prices rose above $120 a barrel to the
highest level since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and
the global financial crisis in September 2009. driven up on
worries over the unrest in Libya and the Middle East and
potential supply threats.
 On Wall Street the broad S&P 500 <.SPX> edged higher as it
faced levels where selling has clustered in recent sessions. It
was hovering just above 1,333, a level that it has been unable
to close above since mid-February.
 The S&P recorded its best two-week period since December on
Friday and the Dow industrials <.DJI> hit its highest intraday

hit an 11-month high against the yen and touched a five-month
peak against the dollar. The single currency later slipped back
with expectations of an increase in rates already priced in by
investors.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2011 11:32AM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-Germany turns power importer after nuclear freeze," * Germany shuts nuclear units, buys power from abroad
 * Domestic coal, gas capacity may be driven harder instead
 
 (Adds grid operator comment in paras 10, 11)
 By Vera Eckert
 FRANKFURT, April 4 (Reuters) - Germany has become a net
power importer from France and the Czech Republic since shutting
its oldest nuclear plants last month, utility group BDEW said on
Monday, sourcing much of it from reactors abroad.
 German wholesale power prices have surged since the
government ordered seven of the country's oldest nuclear plants
to shut after a tsunami crippled a Japanese plant on March 11.
 Berlin's reaction has made Europe's biggest economy a more
attractive market for nuclear power producers such as EDF and
CEZ.
 Since the March 17 order to close around 7,000 megawatts
(MW) of nuclear capacity, Germany gas gone from being a net
exporter of 70-150 gigawatt hours (GWh) a day to a net importer
of 50 GWh of electricity a day, BDEW said on Monday.
 ""Power imports from France and the Czech Republic have
doubled,"" BDEW said. ""German power exports to the Netherlands
and Switzerland have halved.""
 France gets more than 80 percent of its electricity from
nuclear plants, and the Czech Republic generates around a
quarter of its electricity from reactors and most of the rest by
burning coal.
 Some of Germany's lost nuclear capacity has been made up for
by burning more coal, which has driven up coal prices, increased
Germany's climate-warming gas emissions and driven up the price
of EU permits to pollute..
 Wholesale prices of German quarterly power in 2011 and the
benchmark contract for round-the-clock power supply in 2012 have
both risen by 12 percent, BDEW said.
 Germany has some cleaner burning gas plants, which could run
for longer, but it currently makes more economic sense to import
power from French nuclear reactors or Czech coal and nuclear
plants than running Germany's gas plants around the clock.
 For the short term, Germany's neighbours have enough spare
plant capacity to keep systems supplied and in balance, European
grid operators' group Entso-E said.
 But if summer peakload demand, driven by heightened air
conditioning needs, coincides with the nuclear shutdowns in
Germany, reserve power supply margins may shrink, Entso-E
Secretary General Konstantin Staschus told Reuters.
 In the longer term, German utilities plan big capacity
increases to make up for the loss of nuclear energy, BDEW said,
hours before Germany's deputy environment minister said all
nuclear plants should be shut down before 2020.
 ""In the medium term, other strategies may be used, for
example greater exploitation of existing, conventional domestic
capacity (coal and gas-based),"" it said.
 ""This will depend among other things on the central European
merit order,"" it added, referring to a market mechanism whereby
the first plants to be used are those with the lowest marginal
costs.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2011 09:44AM ET</span>",South Korea pulls EU trade deal to fix translation errors ," By Jack Kim	
 SEOUL, April 4 (Reuters) - South Korea will withdraw the
text of a free trade agreement with the European Union from
parliament because it is riddled with translation errors and
introduce a new one in the hope of getting it ratified by July,
its chief trade official said.	
 The admission by Minister for Trade Kim Jong-hoon that the
bill before parliament is unacceptable for further debate until
32 newly discovered errors are fixed is fresh embarrassment for
President Lee Myung-bak's government as it tries to pass
legislation as it enters its final two years in office.	
 The ruling Grand National Party has said it wants to pass
the deal in April, but a politically charged by-election late in
the month make it questionable whether the assembly can muster
the discipline for serious legislative work.	
 ""We will soon be sending a new trade bill to parliament that
corrects the errors,"" Kim told a briefing. ""I feel deep
responsibility as the person in charge. I apologise for not
paying greater and detailed attention.""	
 Kim said a new audit of the text of the translation put
before parliament discovered 32 new errors due largely to stress
on overworked employees. His ministry would be replacing the
bill with a new one at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he said.	
 The European Parliament approved the deal in February,
clearing the way for the EU's largest bilateral free trade deal
to take effect from July as pledged by the two sides.	
 The pact aims to scrap 98 percent of import duties -- 1.6
billion euros of South Korean duties and 11 billion euros of EU
duties -- as well as trade barriers in manufactured goods, farm
products and services over the next five years.	
 The trade bill with the European Union was expected to face
little opposition in South Korea's parliament compared with a
similar pact with the United States, which also needs approval
by the ruling party-controlled assembly.	
 Asia's fourth largest economy has a small but politically
vocal farm lobby that has voiced opposition to the deal with the
United States, claiming it does not do enough to protect farmers
who will be hurt by a surge in imports.

 DHAKA, April 4 (Reuters) Bangladesh in March received a
record monthly high of $1.09 billion in remittances from
citizens abroad, despite the departure of some workers from
turmoil-hit North Africa and the Middle East, the central bank
said on Monday.
 The March figure compared with $956.5 million a year
earlier.
 The central bank said that remittances for the first nine
months of the current fiscal year, from July through March, were
$8.6 billion. That compared with $8.3 billion in the same period
one year earlier.
 Remittances from more than 7 million citizens working abroad
are critical for Bangladesh. They offset its trade deficit and
have kept the country's overall balance of payments in surplus
in recent years.
 For the fiscal year that ended in June 2010, remittances
totalled $10.97 billion, 13 percent above the previous year.
 At the end of March, foreign exchange reserves fell to
$10.73 billion from $11.16 billion in February on the back of
higher costs for imports.
 Analysts say Bangladesh should now tap the labour market in
quake and tsunami-hit Japan which needs people for its
reconstruction, as thousands of Bangladeshis are fleeing from
troubles Libya and Middles East countries.
 Majority of Bangladesh expatriates are employed in those
countries and lion share of the remittances come from there.
 The return of thousands of workers from Libya and other
nations is likely to have a lasting impact on Bangladesh's
economy and jeopardise the government's growth target of 6.7
percent this fiscal year, analysts have said.

 LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro slipped back from
11-month highs against the yen on Monday and a five-month peak
against the dollar, as analysts said expectations for higher
euro zone interest rates were mostly priced in.
 Bids from Asian central banks and other investors are likely
to offer solid support to the euro at $1.4190 against the dollar
with stops through to below $1.4150 also cited by traders.
 Analysts said there were plenty of event risks this week,
including a number of central bank rate decisions in the
developed world and a slew of speakers from the U.S. Federal
Reserve. That could see investors adopt a wait and see stance.
 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment and keep policy ultra-loose on Wednesday, while
comments from a senior Federal Reserve official on Friday
highlighted divergence and uncertainty over the need to tighten
monetary policy in the United States.
 Markets expect the European Central Bank to react to rising
inflationary pressures in the euro zone by raising interest
rates from a record low on Thursday, with a further two 25 basis
point hikes factored in by year-end.
 The euro rose to $1.4269 in Asian trade but stalled ahead of
its November 2010 high, seen as resistance around $1.4281. It
was last at $1.4227, flat for the day.
 ""I think the euro is close to putting in a top now as the
monetary policy divergence story is almost fully priced,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 Technical analysts also highlighted trendline resistance
drawn from the euro's record high struck in July 2008 coming in
around $1.4300.
 ""The move wider in EUR/USD rate differentials seems to have

 Latest speculative positioning data suggests the euro could
be due for a pull-back. Longs in the single currency rose to
56,630 from the previous week's 48,353.
 The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the first time
since May 2010 but retreated to 119.40, down 0.2 percent from
late U.S. trade on Friday.
 ""The yen is likely to continue to gradually weaken but we

bln
 * Economic contraction could wipe out $160 bln of GDP
 * Major costs for Japan if nuclear plant operator
nationalised
 * Power blackouts could cost companies $17 bln - Nomura
 * Bill to decommission damaged reactors could be $19 bln
(Edits paragraph 5)	
 By Rie Ishiguro and Kaori Kaneko	
 TOKYO, April 4 (Reuters) - Japan's government expects last
month's earthquake and tsunami to cost up to $300 billion in
material damage, but the ultimate cost will be far higher.	
 Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) , operator of the
crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, could leave the
government with additional costs in excess of $200 billion
covering nationalisation of the company and compensation claims.	
 Then there is the hit to GDP.	
 The March 11 quake and tsunami knocked out more than 20
percent of Tokyo Electric's power generation capacity and the
shortages will reduce industrial output and could fuel recession
in the world's third-biggest economy.	
 Under a scenario in which Japan's economy shrinks in both
the first and second quarters, close to $160 billion in economic
activity would be wiped out, a Reuters calculation shows.	
 ""A crucial difference for previous earthquakes is the
large-scale power outages and supply chain disruptions caused by
the crippled power plant,"" said Naohiko Baba, chief economist at
Goldman Sachs in Tokyo.	
 ""We assume that power outages will depress production
throughout 2011.""	
 
 The 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that followed dealt
a crushing blow to Japan and will require the country's biggest
reconstruction effort since World War II. More than 12,000
people are confirmed dead and over 15,000 are missing.	
 Most importantly for the economy, the natural disaster
damaged power plants, leaving shortages. Specifically, it left
engineers scrambling to control radiation leaks and avert a
meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant run by Tokyo Electric.	
 
 DAMAGE	
 The government estimated that the disaster damage would cost
at least $190 billion and at most over $300 billion.	
 By either count that would make it the world's costliest
disaster, surpassing both Hurricane Katrina that levelled much
of New Orleans in 2005 and Japan's Kobe earthquake in 1995.	
 Even before Tokyo issued the assessment on March 30, most
private-sector analysts had forecast the damage alone would cost
$200 billion to $250 billion in repairs.	
 Close to 170,000 homes in the north of the country that took
the brunt of the disaster are without power and 200,000 have no
running water. About 46,000 buildings were destroyed or burnt
down, and 155,000 others are damaged. More than 2,000 roads, 56
bridges and 26 railways were either damaged or destroyed.	
 Economic growth will benefit longer term once reconstruction
gets into full swing. But analysts expect the economy to take a
hit until TEPCO and Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc , which
supplies northern Japan, can bring back enough power supply to
meet demand.	
 Nomura estimates the Japanese corporations on its Nomura 400
companies index, which includes all Japan's blue chips such as
Toyota Motor Corp and Sony Corp , to chalk up
$17 billion in lost profits owing to diminished power supply in
the financial year that began on Friday.	
 ""We see a growing risk of prolonged problems with
electricity supply at companies covered by Tokyo Electric Power
and Tohoku Electric Power,"" Nomura said.	
 The areas served by these companies produce half of Japan's
economic activity, Nomura estimates.	
 Analysts forecast the economy will either shrink by 1.4
percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, or expand
around 0.6 percent. GDP fell 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter.	
 However, a Reuters GDP poll for the second quarter of the
year produced a median forecast that the economy would contract
by 1.4 percent.	
 In the worst case scenario, where the economy shrinks by 1.4
percent for two consecutive quarters, $158.6 billion would be
wiped off the economy, according to Reuters calculations.	
 Assuming growth in the first quarter of 0.6 percent followed
by a quarterly contraction of 1.4 percent, a much smaller $46
billion would be lost in GDP.	
 Japan's economy pretty much sailed through the Kobe
earthquake in January 1995, expanding for the first three
quarters of the year before experiencing a slight pull back in
the fourth quarter.	
 
 OTHER COSTS	
 Other costs are adding up.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the crippled nuclear plant
needed to be decommissioned, a process experts said could take
more than a decade and cost up to $19 billion.	
 The world's top insurers have so far said the disaster will
cost them $5 billion, although risk modelling agencies suggest
the overall cost to insurers would be as much as $30 billion.	
 The government, though, could face a much higher bill from
the disaster than first thought as confidence in TEPCO plunges.	
 The firm's shares have dropped as much as 81 percent
since March 11 and analysts said the firm faces huge
compensation claims, factors driving speculation the government
will be left with little choice but to nationalise the company.	
 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch estimated compensation claims
could add up to $133 billion. How quickly TEPCO can resolve the
crisis will be critical to the ultimate bill, analysts said.	
 ""If TEPCO can stabilise their nuclear plant quickly,
compensation claims will likely be less than 1 trillion yen ($12
billion) with payments limited to reimbursing farmers for lost
crops,"" said Nomura analyst Shigeki Matsumoto. 
 ""However, if it remains unstable, meaning long term or
permanent evacuation, then the cost will balloon beyond TEPCO's
means. In that case the government will have to pick up the
portion of compensation costs that TEPCO can't pay.""
[ID:nL3E7EV46V]	
 It could take months to stem radiation leaks, one official
warned, and even longer to regain control of the power station.	
 Under law, TEPCO could be exempt from compensation for
nuclear accidents caused by natural disasters. But in this case,
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said in March that ""it is
impossible that Tokyo Electric would easily be exempted from
liability for this accident.""	
 More than 70,000 people have been evacuated from a 20-km (12
mile) evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi plant.
Another 130,000 people, who live in a 10-km (6 mile) band beyond
the evacuation zone have been advised to leave or stay indoors.	
 If the government stepped in to rescue TEPCO, it could also
be assuming considerable debt.	
 Before the disaster, the company had $91 billion in debt on
its books. Since the catastrophe, it has signed a $24 billion
bank loan, which Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata warned might not
be enough to keep the company going.	
 Added to which, Nomura estimates that TEPCO is paying more
than $1 billion a month for oil and gas to make up for lost
nuclear power generation capacity.

 * Letter: EU fuel law discriminates against Canada's oil
 * Letter: EU's fuel quality laws at odds with ""freer trade""
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, April 4 (Reuters) - The Canadian government has
stepped up lobbying in Europe for its highly-polluting tar sands
industry, repeating its threats of trade conflict, a leaked
letter shows.
 The letter dated March 18 to Europe's commissioners for
climate, trade and energy follows Canada's denial it threatened
to scrap a free trade deal unless the European Union alters
planned environmental laws.
 ""Given the desire for freer trade between us, it is
important that our individual efforts to address climate change
do not lead to the creation of unnecessary barriers,"" Canadian
trade official Mark Richardson said in a document sent with the
letter.
 ""The Government of Canada believes this approach raises the
prospect of unjustified discrimination and is not supported by
the science.""
 The dispute centres around EU plans to make fuel suppliers
reduce the carbon footprint of fuels by 6 percent over the next
decade. The EU is now fine-tuning a ranking of fuels to help
suppliers identify the most carbon-intensive imports.
 Canada could challenge that ranking by launching a lawsuit
at the World Trade Organization, where it has already disputed
other EU initiatives.
 Canada says the standards would instantly constrict a
possible future market for its oil sands -- oil that is trapped
in sediment and forms the world's second-largest proven crude
reserves after those of Saudi Arabia.
 Environmentalists oppose the tar sands industry, saying the
extra energy needed to extract the oil intensifies the impact on
climate by about a quarter, while polluted waste water harms
wildlife and pollutes rivers.
 Canada does not deny exploiting its oil sands is carbon
intensive, but says the EU overestimates the impact and is wrong
to single out such production without giving equal attention to
other carbon-intensive crude oils, such as heavy grades from the
Middle East and Nigeria.
 
 DISCRIMINATORY
 Though couched in the gentle words of diplomacy, the letter
from Canada's ambassador to the European Union, Ross Hornby, has
left EU officials in little doubt they are being threatened with
action at the World Trade Organization and possibly over the
trade talks.
 Further warnings came in another note sent with the letter.
 ""Singling out oil sands crude creates an artificial and
potentially discriminatory regulatory distinction,"" said the
note from Mark Corey of Canada's natural resources department.
 Canada's Trade Minister Peter Van Loan has denied any link
between the tar sands dispute and trade talks. 
 The evidence of further threats of trade conflict comes at a
difficult time for Canada's Conservative government, which was
toppled 10 days ago by opponents accusing it of sleaze and
mismanagement.
 Canada has challenged the EU at the World Trade Organization
in various disputes, such as over hormone-treated beef,
genetically modified foods and seal products, so the European
Commission is readying itself for another legal fight.
 The Commission had initially proposed that tar sands should
be ascribed a greenhouse gas value of 107 grams per megajoule of
fuel, making it clear to buyers that it had far greater climate
impact than average crude oil at 87.1 grams.

 * Higher PPI to add to ECB inflation concerns
 * ECB tipped to raise rates several times this year
 
 (Adds economists' comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, April 4 (Reuters) - Surging energy costs drove
euro zone factory gate prices higher in February, likely setting
the seal on the European Central Bank's first interest rate rise
since 2008 later this week.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on
Monday producer prices in the 17 countries using the euro rose
0.8 percent month-on-month for a 6.6 percent year-on-year
increase, signalling growing pressures early in the inflation
pipeline.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7 percent
monthly gain and a 6.7 percent annual rise in producer prices,
which are often a precursor to changes in consumer prices.
 ""The further spike up ... will reinforce the ECB's concern
that high energy and commodity prices are exerting serious
inflationary pressures lower down the supply chain,"" said Howard
Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 Energy prices rose 1.2 percent on the month for a 12.8
percent annual increase, Eurostat said.
 It revised down gains in factory gate prices for January to
1.3 percent month-on-month from 1.5 percent and to 5.9 percent
year-on-year from 6.1 percent.
 Producer price increases, unless absorbed by intermediaries
and retailers, translate into higher consumer prices, annual
growth of which the ECB aims to restrict to below but close to 2
percent in the medium term.
 The bank is widely expected to raise interest rates on
Thursday for the first time since October 2008.
 Consumer price inflation was 2.6 percent in March, Eurostat
estimated last week, up from 2.4 percent in February.
 According to an indicator designed to predict inflation
trends from the Economic Cycle Research Institute, inflationary
pressures in the euro zone reached a 29-month high in February.
 
 'TOUGH ON INFLATION'
 ""The ECB hopes by sending out the message that it will be
tough on inflation it can contain households' inflation
expectations and companies' pricing expectations,"" Archer said.
 ""(It would) thereby limit the risks that the current
inflation spike up resulting from high energy and commodity
prices will feed through to have significant second-round
inflationary effects.""
 Economists expect consumer inflation will remain above the
ECB target in 2011 and that an April 7 rate rise from a record
low of 1 percent could be just the first of several this year.
 ""We are now leaning towards the view that the ECB will hike
interest rates by a further 25 basis points in both the third
and the fourth quarters, taking them up to 1.75 percent by the
end of the year,"" Archer said.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro slipped back from
11-month highs against the yen on Monday and a five-month peak
against the dollar, as analysts said expectations for higher
euro zone interest rates were becoming priced in.
 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment on Wednesday, while comments from a Federal Reserve
official on Friday highlighted uncertainty over the need to
tighten monetary policy in the United States.
 Markets expect the European Central Bank to react to rising
inflationary pressures in the euro zone by raising interest
rates from a record low on Thursday, with a further two 25 basis
point hikes factored in by year-end.
 The euro rose to $1.4269 against the dollar in Asian trade
but stalled ahead of its November 2010 high, seen as resistance
around $1.4281. It slipped back to $1.4194 in Europe, down
around 0.2 percent for the day.
 ""I think the euro is close to putting in a top now as the

Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.

 ""The move wider in EUR/USD rate differentials seems to have

indicating that some euro positives are already priced in by the
market."" said Valentin Marinov, currency analyst at CitiFX in a
note.
 Latest speculative positioning data suggests the euro could
be ripe for a pull-back. Longs in the single currency continued
to bulk up, rising to 56,630 from the previous week's 48,353.
 The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the first time
since May 2010 but retreated to 119.40, down 0.2 percent from
late U.S. trade on Friday.
 ""The yen is likely to continue to gradually weaken but we
see more upside for dollar/yen rather than euro/yen. We think
the market is underestimating U.S. rate hike expectations,"" said
Hardman at BTM-UFJ.
 One of the Federal Reserve's most powerful policymakers on
Friday went against an increasingly hawkish tone from some other
Fed officials worried about inflation, saying he saw no need for
the central bank to reverse course.
 William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, said the Fed was ""still very far away"" from achieving its
mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability,
even though the economy is on a firmer footing.
 The dollar was slightly firmer versus a currency basket on
Monday, trading up 0.1 percent at 75.929. Better-than-expected
U.S. employment data on Friday, hinting at a stronger economic
recovery and the possibility for higher U.S. interest rates,
leant the greenback some support.
 
 AUSSIE OFF HIGHS
 The dollar was flat around 83.95 yen. It had hit a six-month
high of 84.735 yen on Friday on trading platform EBS, stalling
ahead of an option barrier at 84.75. Traders reported good
interest to sell dollars into the 85.00 area.
 The dollar was up around 11 percent from its post-World War
Two record low of 76.25 yen struck in March.
 It rose above its 200-day moving average at 83.57 last week,
in a sign that its downtrend against the yen may have run its
course, while a potential upside target lies at its
mid-September high of 85.94 yen.
 The yen hovered near recent lows on the crosses,
particularly against higher yielding currencies like the
Australian dollar.
 The Aussie reached highs not seen since early May 2010 at
87.69 yen, and was last at 87.12. It has gained roughly 16
percent from a low hit on March 17.
 The Aussie hit a fresh 29-year high against the greenback in
the Asian session of $1.0422. It slipped back to trade at 1.0370
in European dealing, down 0.2 percent on the day. (Editing

(Adds background, detail, analyst quote)
 STOCKHOLM, April 4 (Reuters) - A Swedish central banker said
the strength of ECB signals pointing to a rise this week in euro
zone interest rates had surprised her, sparking talk she might
soon switch her policy stance in favour of faster hikes at home.
 Riksbank Deputy Governor Karolina Ekholm said on Monday
clear indications by the European Central Bank it would hike
rates had come as a surprise.
 ""What it means for my position is too early to say. I will
have to make a comprehensive assessment at the next (Swedish
monetary policy) meeting,"" she told reporters after giving a
speech.
 The ECB is widely expected to hike rates on Thursday to tame
rising inflationary pressure. 
 Sweden's central bank, which meets again later this month,
has raised rates at each of its last five meetings as the
domestic economy bounced back faster from the global downturn
than most of the rest of the developed world.
 The consensus from its policymakers is for further steep
rises ahead, while Ekholm was one of two central bankers who
disagreed with the most recent hikes.
 Danske Markets Chief Economist Roger Josefsson said she may
shift her stance on rates soon.
 ""I wouldn't be very surprised if the board's two doves,
Ekholm and Lars Svensson, revised up their rate paths already in
April in light of the fact the rest of the world more clearly
has indicated they will tighten policy,"" he said.
 She and Deputy Governor Svensson have wanted lower rates and
a lower rate path.
 The next Swedish interest rate announcement is due on April
20, a day after the central bank meets.
 
 CROWN IN FOCUS
 In her speech published on the Riksbank's website, Ekholm
said the Swedish crown could appreciate more than the central
bank's forecasts suggested, while the gap between Swedish
interest rates and those of key central banks in other regions
was likely to remain wider than anticipated.
 ""As a stronger crown dampens both inflationary pressures
and resource utilisation, I believe that a lower repo rate path
than that decided upon would lead to better target fulfilment,""
she said.
 Analysts said that her speech broadly repeated her stance
from the last policy meeting, but that there were indications
she could move towards the majority on the Riksbank's board.
 ""She probably won't change her stance at the April meeting
but there are elements in her reasoning that could indicate she
may change her stance later on,"" said Torbjorn Isaksson, analyst
at Nordea.
 ""She expresses she is vigilant about inflation expectations,
and these have come up and we expect them to rise further. Also,
it now seems key rates around the world will rise (more) than
the Riksbank forecasts.""
 Sweden's economy grew 5.5 percent in 2010, the biggest
increase since at least 1970. 
 The robust growth rate as well as rising borrowing costs
pushed the crown to a 10-year high against the euro in
mid-February but the Swedish currency has eased back since then
as expectations for the timing of anticipated rate rises in
Europe have been pushed forward.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro slipped back from
11-month highs against the yen on Monday and a five-month peak
against the dollar, as analysts said expectations for higher
euro zone interest rates were becoming priced in.
 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment on Wednesday, while comments from a Federal Reserve
official on Friday highlighted uncertainty over the need to
tighten monetary policy in the United States.
 Markets expect the European Central Bank to raise interest
rates by 25 basis points from a record low on Thursday, with a
further two hikes factored in by year-end.
 The euro rose to $1.4269 against the dollar but stalled
ahead of its November 2010 high, seen as resistance around
$1.4281. It later eased to $1.4230 to trade around flat on the
day.
 ""I think the euro is close to putting in a top now as the
monetary policy divergence story is almost fully priced,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 Technical analysts also highlighted trendline resistance
drawn from the euro's record high struck in July 2008 coming in
around $1.4300.
 ""The move wider in EUR/USD rate differentials seems to have
lost some of its impetus in the run up to the ECB rate decision
indicating that some euro positives are already priced in by the
market."" said Valentin Marinov, currency analyst at CitiFX in a
note.
 The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the first time
since May 2010 and last traded at 119.55 yen, down 0.1 percent
from late U.S. trade on Friday.
 ""The yen is likely to continue to gradually weaken but we
see more upside for dollar/yen rather than euro/yen. We think
the market is underestimating U.S. rate hike expectations,"" said
Hardman at BTM-UFJ.
 One of the Federal Reserve's most powerful policymakers on
Friday went against an increasingly hawkish tone from some other
Fed officials worried about inflation, saying he saw no need for
the central bank to reverse course.
 William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, said the Fed was ""still very far away"" from achieving its
mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability,
even though the economy is on a firmer footing.
 The dollar was little changed versus a currency basket on
Monday, trading around 75.786. Stronger-than-expected U.S.
employment data on Friday, hinting at a stronger economic
recovery and the possibility for higher U.S. interest rates,
leant the greenback some support.
 
 AUSSIE BUOYANT
 The dollar was flat around 84.04 yen. It had hit a six-month
high of 84.735 yen on Friday on trading platform EBS, stalling
ahead of an option barrier at 84.75. Traders reported good
interest to sell dollars into the 85.00 area.
 The dollar was up around 11 percent from its post-World War
Two record low of 76.25 yen struck in March.
 It rose above its 200-day moving average at 83.57 last week,
in a sign that its downtrend against the yen may have run its
course, while a potential upside target lies at its
mid-September high of 85.94 yen.
 The yen hovered near recent lows on the crosses,
particularly against higher yielding currencies like the
Australian dollar.
 The Aussie reached highs not seen since early May 2010 at
87.69 yen, and was last at 87.25 yen, down 0.1 percent from late
U.S. trade on Friday. It has gained roughly 16 percent from a
low hit on March 17.
 The Aussie also hit a fresh 29-year high against the
greenback, reaching $1.0422 after breaching a barrier at
$1.0400, which triggered stop-loss buying. It eased back to
trade flat for the day around 1.0400 in European dealing.

 * Wall Street to open higher
 * Euro slips back after hitting multi-month highs
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Solid signs of growth in the
world economy and prospects for M&A supported global equities on
Monday while expectations of higher euro zone interest rates
took the euro briefly to an 11-month high against Japan's yen.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher, having hit its
highest intraday level on Friday since June 2008.
 Investors were generally upbeat about the global economy
following solid U.S. jobs data on Friday.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up a third of a
percent, flirting with a month high and close to gaining 5
percent for the year to date.
 There were underpinned mainly by emerging stocks, up 0.6
percent. Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.1 percent.
 European stocks opened lower but posted gains soon after,
adding to three-week highs hit on Friday with a quarter of a
percent rise for the FTSEurofirst 300.
 Corporate activity was in focus with shares in chemical
group Rhodia jumping after Belgium's Solvay launched a bid for
its French rival.
 Vodafone rose after selling its 44 percent stake in France's
second biggest telecom operator SFR to Vivendi.
 But it is the improving macroeconomic backdrop that has been
primarily responsible for equities bouncing back from their
March tumble, related to Japan's disaster and civil unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East.
 This growth improvement has cemented expectations that the
European Central Bank will raise interest rates on Thursday and
led to speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve may be getting
closer to withdrawing exceptional liquidity.
 ""As the economy turns the corner and gets back on its feet,
central bankers are beginning to see inflation as a greater
threat than lack of growth,"" said Jonathan Sudaria, dealer at
Capital Spreads.
 
 RATES DRIVE EURO
 Reflecting expectations of differing rate paths, the euro
hit fresh 11-month highs against a broadly weaker yen and
touched a five-month peak against the dollar.
 The single currency later slipped back.
 In contrast to the ECB, the Bank of Japan is likely to
downgrade its economic assessment at its meeting on Wednesday
and may consider finding more ways to help the economy recover
from last month's massive earthquake and devastating tsunami.
 Key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rates hit new 21-month
highs on Monday, boosted by rate hike expectations.
 The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the first time
since May 2010 and was later at 119.51 yen. It hit a five-month
high against the dollar of $1.4269 and was later at $1.4215.
 ""I think the euro is close to putting in a top now as the
monetary policy divergence story is almost fully priced,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 There was little respite for the euro zone periphery's bond
sector with Fitch cutting Portugal's credit ratings by three
notches to BBB- late on Friday, one notch above junk, and
signalling further downgrades are likely.
 Traders also said Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero's decision not to seek a third term in 2012 elections
would raise questions over Madrid's future commitment to
economic reforms.

 * Loosened grip seen as temporary - analysts
(Recasts with analysts' comments, details)	
 By Yoo Choonsik	
 SEOUL, April 4 (Reuters) - A surprisingly small increase in
foreign reserves in March has highlighted South Korea's decision
to loosen its grip on the rising won to curb inflation, though
Seoul's tolerance of a stronger currency may not last long.	
 Analysts and traders believe the shift in currency policy
was largely a short-term one, aimed at calming public anger over
quickening inflation ahead of key by-elections later this month.	
 The won hit a low for the year on March 17 but has since has
risen 4.4 percent on the U.S. dollar to around 1,086. The sharp
run-up has surprised hedge funds and other investors who had
expected authorities to continue to rein in the Korean currency
to ensure robust export growth. 
 ""The pace of appreciation in the past couple of weeks has
certainly been impressive, but it will eventually come to a
pause and the won will consolidate back to a more sustainable
pace of appreciation,"" Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Hong Kong.	
 South Korea's inflation in February was double the average
rate for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). In March it picked up further to a
29-month high of 4.7 percent.	
 The government has pledged to keep inflation at around 3
percent on average for the whole of the year, while the central
bank has forecast inflation would average at 3.5 percent.	
 Growing price pressures have emerged as a hot issue as
President Lee Myung-bak's party faces tough competition from the
opposition in by-elections later this month in several regions,
which will be a test for next year's presidential race.	
 Bitter memories of a near sovereign insolvency in the late
1990s, sparked in part by an overvalued won and big
current account deficits, have since led South Korea to maintain
zero tolerance to any sharp currency appreciation.	
 
 MEMORIES OF 1997-98 CRISIS 
 But central bank data released on Monday showed some signs
of a change in policy. Foreign exchange reserves in Asia's
fourth-largest economy rose only $0.95 billion last month even
as the won rose the most in six months.	
 The Bank of Korea attributed the gain to strength in
non-dollar assets and investment gains. Central bank officials
do not comment on market talk of intervention.	
 The reserves were at a record $298.62 billion in March, some
30 percent of the country's annual gross domestic product that
passed $1 trillion last year.	
 The country's foreign reserves added $1.71 billion in
February and $4.39 billion in January after reports by currency
traders of government dollar-buying interventions aimed at
smoothing the won's rise.	
 The small rise in reserves also came as the won rose nearly
3 percent against the dollar in March, making it the best month
since September last year.	
 Traders on Monday reported South Korean authorities were
buying dollars as the won rose to its strongest level against
the dollar since early September 2008, but intervention was not
so strong as to wipe out all of the won's gains. 
 Analysts said South Korean authorities, mindful of a firmer
won's impact on the country's exporters, could turn more active
in checking the currency's sharp appreciation should oil and
other raw materials prices show signs of easing.	
 ""The authorities will see the need for intervention ease
anyway once oil prices rose further above $120 (per barrel) and
the yen kept weakening (against the dollar),"" a veteran currency
trader in Seoul said. Currency traders would comment mostly on
condition they are not named.	
 Even if upward pressure on the won lasted a long time, the
government of President Lee Myung-bak would probably tighten
its grip on the currency against after the April 27
by-elections, analysts said.	
 South Korea's foreign reserves ranked seventh in the world
at the end of February.

 By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto	
 TOKYO, April 4 (Reuters) - The yen will weaken in coming
months possibly beyond 90 yen per dollar, Japan's former
currency czar Eisuke Sakakibara said on Monday, underlining
expectations a near four-year rally in the currency may be over.	
 A former senior Bank of Japan official also forecast the yen
would decline, weighing into an intensifying debate in financial
markets on whether the currency is poised for a lasting reversal
after striking a record high of 76.25 per dollar in March.	
 The push to the record high was sparked by speculation that
Japanese would repatriate funds for reconstruction following an
earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that also shut down a nuclear
power plant to leave engineers scrambling to prevent a meltdown.	
 G7 intervention to knock the yen back and expectations
Japan's central bank may further ease its already ultra-loose
monetary policy just as the European Central Bank and the
Federal Reserve look poised to raise rates could fuel the yen's
longer-term turnaround.	
 The currency traded at 84.05 per dollar on Monday.	
 ""I would not be surprised if the dollar/yen exceeds 90,""
said Sakakibara, who was known as Mr Yen in the 1990s when he
spearheaded currency intervention by Japan to stem a rise in the
yen.	
 ""This atomic power issue is an incident which would result
in depreciation of the exchange rate... This kind of
depreciation of the currency will probably continue at least for
some time to come, for the next three to six months,"" Sakakibara
told foreign correspondents in Tokyo.	
 
 Sakakibara served as vice minister for international affairs
at the finance ministry between 1997 to 1999. Although he is now
a professor at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, his currency
comments are still closely followed by investors.	
 The yen has risen steadily from 124 yen in the middle of
2007 and speculation that its trend may be turning has also
spurred talk of a return of the yen carry trade, a trading
tactic where the low-yielding currency is used to fund
investments in higher-yielding assets. [ID:nL3E7EV00H]	
 That explains a roughly 16 percent rally in the Australian
dollar against the yen since a low on March 17, currency traders
said. 
 While Japan's central bank has set official interest rates
at 0-0.1 percent, the Reserve Bank of Australia has set its
rates at 4.75 percent, suggesting a significant yield pick up
from investing in Australia assets.	
 Japan's yield differences are also set to deteriorate
against the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
 The ECB is widely expected to raise its policy rate on
Thursday to 1.25 percent from 1.0 percent on worries about
inflation.	
 Fed officials have sounded more hawkish in recent remarks as
U.S. unemployment has fallen steadily, raising expectations that
the U.S. central bank is moving closer to boosting rates, which
were pushed to effectively zero during the global financial
crisis.	
 The Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy would likely
weaken the yen in the medium- to long-term, Eiji Hirano, former
executive director at the BOJ, said in separate comments on
Monday.	
 But if the yen spikes up sharply again, the Group of Seven
is likely to step into the currency market again, Hirano, who
used to attend G7 meetings, told Reuters in an interview.	
 "" The yen's move just after the quake was a perfect
case for concerted intervention,"" he said. ""The markets are
still unstable. In the event of severe market turmoil, the G7
nations may jointly intervene again.""	
 At its April 6-7 policy meeting, the BOJ is likely to
underline its dovish policy stance by discussing the launch of a
credit line to financial institutions in the quake-affected
areas. 
 It may also consider further monetary easing to help the
economy cope with the disaster that caused power shortages in
Tokyo and areas north of the capital, regions that Nomura says
produces half of the economy's activity. [ID:nL3E7F105M]	
 ""The yen would naturally be investors' least favourite if
the global economy is to recover as expected, given various
risks facing Japan's economy, most notably the nuclear crisis,""
said Yuichi Kodama, economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance in
Tokyo.	
 ""The BOJ is unlikely to consider a rate hike probably
through next year while the Federal Reserve may raise rates late
this year. This is a good enough factor to revive the yen carry
trade, although the chances of safe-haven buying of the yen are
still there if commodity prices surge.""	
 A reversal of the yen's long-term uptrend would seem to be
positive news for Japan's export-reliant economy.	
 But policymakers are starting to worry that a weak yen could
hamper a recovery as import needs grow for energy and resources
for reconstruction. [ID:nL3E7EU3P6]	
 Not all investors are signalling the yen's fall would be
sustained.	
 Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer of top bond
fund PIMCO, said last week Japan will repatriate more funds than
markets expect to finance its reconstruction efforts,
strengthening the yen.	
 In contrast, Sakakibara told reporters that foreign money
leaving the country was a cause for concern.	
 ""This atomic energy crisis will continue for a long time, so
that risk could be perceived as a very serious country risk for
this country.""

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro hit fresh
11-month highs against a broadly weaker yen on Monday and
touched a five-month peak against the dollar with markets all
but certain the European Central Bank will raise interest rates
later this week.	
 In contrast, the Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its
economic assessment at its meeting on Wednesday and may consider
finding more ways to help the economy recover from last month's
massive earthquake and devastating tsunami. 
 This is likely to weigh on the Japanese currency, which is
already under pressure following a rare coordinated G7
intervention to temper runaway yen gains on March 18.	
 The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the
first time since May 2010 and last traded at 119.65 yen, up 0.1
percent from late U.S. trade on Friday.	
 ""Coming into the ECB meeting this week, we have to
anticipate further euro gains,"" said Todd Elmer, currency
strategist at Citi in Singapore.	
 The single currency hit a five-month high against the dollar
of $1.4269 on trading platform EBS earlier on Monday, having
gained a lift from some stop-loss buying, traders said, adding
that more stops were seen towards $1.4300.	
 The euro later trimmed its gains to stand at $1.4225 ,
down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday.	
 The euro's earlier rise brought it close to resistance at
its November peak of $1.4283, a level that also roughly
coincides with trendline resistance drawn from the euro's record
high struck in July 2008. 
 A clear breach of that resistance could open the way for the
euro to climb further, with one possible target seen at $1.4374,
the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's slide between
November 2009 to June 2010.	
 ""I don't think investors are overly long at this stage. You
could see some people forced to chase the move. That has the
potential to fuel further gains,"" said Elmer at Citi in
Singapore.

 YEN DIPS DOLLAR, EURO	
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 84.11 yen . It had
hit a six-month high of 84.735 yen on Friday on trading platform
EBS, up 11 percent from its post-World War Two record low of
76.25 yen struck in March.	
 The dollar rose above its 200-day moving average against the
yen last week, in a sign that its downtrend against the yen may
be drawing to a close, and one potential upside target lies at
its mid-September high of 85.94 yen.	
 ""However, we think the further rise of USD will be limited
or even reversed as recent market expectation over the early end
of U.S. QE2 and the start of rate hiking within this year looks
overdone,"" analysts at Barclays Capital wrote in a report.	
 Indeed, one of the Federal Reserve's most powerful
policymakers on Friday pushed back against an increasingly
hawkish tone from some other Fed officials worried about
inflation, saying he saw no need for the central bank to reverse
course. 
 William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, said the Fed was ""still very far away"" from achieving its
mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability,
even though the economy is on a firmer footing. [ID:nN01154414]	
 ""He did not disappoint, other than those hoping that he
would change his tune, and those scrambling on the USD
bandwagon,"" said David Watt, strategist at RBC.	
 While this means further gains in dollar/yen may be
difficult, weakness in the yen will most likely continue to be
expressed on the crosses, particularly against higher yielding
currencies like the Australian dollar, market players say.	
 The Australian dollar has reached highs not seen since early
May 2010 at 87.69 yen earlier on Monday, and was last
at 87.35 yen, down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday.
It has gained roughly 16 percent from a low hit on March 17.	
 The Aussie also hit a fresh 29-year high against the
greenback, reaching $1.0422 earlier on Monday after
breaching a barrier at $1.04, which triggered stop-loss buying.

 By Leika Kihara	
 TOKYO, April 4 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will not
hesitate to buy more government bonds from the market if needed
to calm investors, as the country's economy may contract this
fiscal year due to the earthquake, a former senior BOJ official
said.	
 While the yen is likely to weaken in the medium to long term
as the BOJ maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy, the Group
of Seven will likely step into the currency market again if the
yen spikes at an alarming rate, said Eiji Hirano, who as
executive director at the Japanese central bank attended
numerous G7 gatherings.	
 ""The yen's move just after the quake was a perfect case for
concerted intervention,"" Hirano told Reuters in an interview on
Monday.	
 ""The markets are still unstable. In the event of severe
market turmoil, the G7 nations may jointly intervene again.""	
 In their first joint intervention since 2000, the Group of
Seven nations sold the yen after it spiked to record
highs after the March 11 earthquake, threatening to deal another
blow to an export-reliant economy that was just picking up from
a lull when the disaster struck.	
 G7 nations are unlikely to issue a statement on currencies
when they gather on the sidelines of an IMF meeting later this
month, but will stick to their stance of taking action in
currency markets when necessary, said Hirano, who left the BOJ
in 2006 but has close ties with central bankers across the
globe.	
 Japan is struggling to contain a nuclear crisis triggered by
the quake and subsequent tsunami but also needs to start finding
ways to cover the huge cost of disaster relief and keep damage
to the fragile economy to a minimum amid the threat of
electricity blackouts due to the loss of power plants.	
 Some lawmakers have called on the BOJ to directly underwrite
government bonds to help pay for disaster relief, although key
cabinet ministers and senior ruling party lawmakers have
dismissed the idea as unlikely and inappropriate.	
 Hirano toed the BOJ's official line, saying that for the
central bank to print money to directly finance government debt
would further undermine market confidence in Japan's fiscal
discipline and could backfire by triggering sharp rises in bond
yields.	
 But he said there was more the BOJ could do, such as further
expanding its asset buying programme or buying more government
bonds from the market.	
 ""The BOJ already buys government bonds from the market. I
think it won't hesitate to buy more government bonds if it feels
doing so would help keep markets stable,"" Hirano said.	
 The BOJ is expected to revise down its assessment of the
economy at a meeting ending on Thursday and to discuss launching
a new scheme to offer quake-hit financial institutions one-year
loans at an interest rate of 0.1 percent, sources say.
[ID:nL3E7F105M]	
 The BOJ board may also consider easing monetary policy
further if it is convinced that the disaster could sharply delay
the economy's return to a moderate recovery, although the
dominant market view is for the BOJ to stand pat at least until
the following review, due on April 28.	
 The government last month estimated direct damage from the
quake and tsunami at as much as $310 billion, making it the
world's costliest natural disaster.	
 But the estimate does not take into account the effect of
power blackouts on factory output and business sentiment, which
Hirano says could weigh on Japan's economy for several years and
nudge it into a contraction in the financial year that began on
April 1.	
 ""The biggest problem is shortage of power supply. Factory
output will slump in the near term. But the long-term pain will
be felt more by the service sector, which consumes a lot of
electricity,"" said Hirano, who is now executive vice president
of Toyota Financial Services, the financial arm of Toyota Motor
Corp .

 * More bodies recovered from tsunami-hit coast
 * Damages bill could top $300 billion
 * Business sentiment turns negative after disaster

 By Chizu Nomiyama and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 4 (Reuters) - Japanese engineers put dye into
radioactive water on Monday to check if they had managed to stop
a leak from one reactor at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant
but one official warned it would be months before the crisis was
under control.	
 In the face of Japan's biggest crisis since World War Two,
one newspaper poll said that nearly two-thirds of voters want
the government to form a coalition with the major opposition
party and work together to recover from the massive damage from
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.	
 Underlining the concern over the impact on the world's third
largest economy, a central bank survey showed that big
manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen significantly
in the next three months, though they were not quite as
pessimistic as some analysts had expected. [ID:L3E7F4006]	
 An aide to embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Sunday
that the government's priority now was to stop radiation leaks
from the Fukushima nuclear plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of
Tokyo, and that the situation had ""somewhat stabilised"".	
 ""How long will it take to achieve (the goal of stopping the
radiation leaks)? I think several months would be one target,""
said Goshi Hosono, a ruling party lawmaker and aide to Kan.	
 
 Engineers at plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO)
have been scrambling to find anything that will help
stop the leaks and prevent reactors from overheating.	
 They mixed sawdust and newspapers with polymers and cement
to try to seal a crack in a concrete pit at reactor no.2, where
radioactive water has been seeping into the sea. 
 ""We were hoping the polymers would function like diapers but
are yet to see a visible effect,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a
deputy director general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency. 
 Nishiyama said three of the six reactors were now generally
stable. TEPCO has said it will scrap at least four reactors once
they are under control, but this could take years or even
decades.	
 Japan's crisis has rocked the nuclear industry and the
European Union said on Sunday it will affect the fight against
climate change as energy policies are reviewed. [ID:nL3E7F3049]	
 Germany and Switzerland have said they will shut older
reactors or suspend approvals, China has suspended approvals for
new plants, and Taiwan is studying cutting nuclear output.	
 Japan may review its pledge to cut its 2020 greenhouse gas
emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels in the wake of the
Fukushima nuclear power plant crisis, Japanese media quoted a
senior environment ministry official as saying.	
 ""It is true that our reduction target will be affected
significantly,"" Hideki Minamikawa, vice minister for global
environmental affairs, was quoted by the Yomiuri newspaper as
saying. [ID:L3E7F30F3]	
 
 PM UNDER PRESSURE	
 The 9.0 magnitude quake and tsunami left nearly 28,000
people dead or missing and Japan's northeast coast a splintered
wreck. The disaster has hit economic production and left a
damages bill which may top $300 billion.	
 Prime Minister Kan is under intense pressure to steer Japan
through the crisis, but after three weeks many Japanese are
angry the humanitarian disaster seems to have taken a back seat
to the nuclear crisis.	
 Though criticised for his crisis management, voter support
for Kan's government rose to 31 percent in a Yomiuri newspaper
poll, from 24 percent in a survey conducted before the quake.	
 Almost 70 percent of respondents, however, believed Kan was
not exercising leadership, 19 percent wanting him to step down
soon. 
 There has been talk that Kan's ruling Democratic Party of
Japan join forces with its main political opponent, the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP). But so far there has been no sign the
two are close to any deal.	
 Kan last month invited LDP head Sadakazu Tanigaki to join
the cabinet as deputy premier for disaster relief, but he
declined.

 MOVES TO STOP POWER BLACKOUTS	
 More than 163,710 people are living in shelters, with more
than 70,000 people evacuated from a 20 km (12 mile) no-go zone
area the nuclear plant. Another 136,000 people living a further
10 km out have been told to leave or stay indoors.	
 The government estimates damage from the earthquake and
tsunami at 16 trillion to 25 trillion yen ($190 billion-$298
billion). The top estimate would make it the world's costliest
natural disaster.	
 Manufacturing has slumped to a two-year low as a result of
power outages and quake damage hitting supply chains and
production.	
 The Bank of Japan's tankan business sentiment survey,
although negative, was not as grim as analysts had expected,
With some suggesting the results were not reliable.	
 ""I think many firms will have filled out the surveys before
the quake and sent them after the quake, so this reading may be
misleading to gauge the impact of the quake,"" said Masamichi
Adachi, senior economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan.	
 General Electric , which helped build the Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear power plant will help TEPCO supply electricity
in the coming months when demand soars. [ID:nL3E7F304N]	
 Demand for power jumps in Japan in summer due to
heavy use of air conditioners. More than 168,500 households in
the north are still without electricity after the tsunami.	
 The government has said it will restrict maximum power use
by companies during the hotter months in an effort to avoid
further blackouts.	
 Japan's health ministry said on Sunday it had detected
radioactive substances higher than legal limits in mushrooms
from Iwaki in Fukushima, said Kyodo.	
 ""Grown in Fukushima"" has become a warning label for those
nervous of radiation which has already been found in some
vegetables close to the nuclear plant.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, April 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose to their
highest in nearly 3 years on Monday after strong U.S. jobs
growth spurred optimism about the global economy, while the euro
hit an 11-month peak against the yen amid expectations of a euro
zone rate hike later this week.	
 But European shares were seen dipping after hefty gains at
the end of last week, with investors turning more cautious ahead
of policy meetings later in the week by the European Central
Bank and Bank of England.	
 ""As the economy turns the corner and gets back on its feet,
central bankers are beginning to see inflation as a greater
threat than lack of growth,"" said Jonathan Sudaria, dealer at
Capital Spreads. 
 Bookmakers called the major European indexes to open down
0.2-0.5 percent, while S&P 500 futures  eased 0.2 percent,
pointing to a weaker start for U.S. shares. 
 U.S. crude oil rose to its highest in 2-1/2 years as unrest
in the Middle East and fighting in Libya stoked fears of supply
disruptions. Gold edged up, supported by crude prices and the
stronger euro. 
 
 Data showing U.S. employment grew solidly for a second month
in March boosted Wall Street on Friday. Investors interpreted it
as a sign of a strengthening economic recovery, although most
analysts did not expect it to prompt the Federal Reserve to
change its ultra-loose monetary policy for the time being.	
 In contrast, the ECB Bank is seen as almost certain to raise
borrowing costs by 25 basis points on Thursday, supporting the
single currency despite worries about the crushing debt burden
of some euro zone countries.	
 Most Asian central banks -- with the major exception of
Japan -- have already begun tightening due to concerns about
inflation and asset bubbles, contributing to a patchy
performance of the region's equity markets so far this year.	
 ""Share market valuation is at best neutral for Asia-ex-Japan
but rising inflation and worries about policy tightening means
that returns could lag the rest of the world this year,"" said
Andrew Pease, chief investment strategist Asia-Pacific at
Russell Investments.	
 
 UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK	
 Japan's Nikkei gave up some early gains to finish up
0.1 percent, supported by gains on Wall Street on Friday, when
the S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent. 
 ""Firmness in U.S. shares and the weakness of the yen,
especially against the euro, encouraged buying in the
export-related sector,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund
manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo.	
 The weakening yen may help Japanese exporters, although the
outlook for Japan remains clouded by uncertainty over the full
cost of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11.	
 Big Japanese manufacturers expect business conditions to
worsen in the next three months, responses to a Bank of Japan
survey collected after the quake showed, as rolling power
blackouts and a nuclear safety crisis threaten to delay the
return to a moderate economic recovery. [ID:nL3E7F4006]	
 Although it has recovered more than two-thirds of the ground
lost during its steep tumble in the aftermath of the quake, the
Nikkei remains around 5 percent below its March 11 close.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.6 percent and touched its highest level
since May 2008, its second near 3-year peak in as many sessions.	
 Emerging markets -- led by Asia -- saw their first monthly
gain of the year in March, outperforming world and developed
market stocks for the first time since September, strategists at
Citi said in a note. 
 Data from fund tracker EPFR Global on Friday showed
investors returning to emerging market equity funds, with the
end of March seeing the second largest weekly inflow this year,
although the first quarter still showed the largest outflow
since the third quarter of 2008.[ID:nN01157918]	
 
 EURO GAINS	
 The euro traded around 119.80 yen , after
breaching the 120 yen level for the first time since last May.
The dollar was steady at 84.15 yen , having reached a
six-month high around 84.72 on Friday. 
 Investors are positioning for an increase in the ECB's key
interest rate to 1.25 percent, widening the euro zone's yield
advantage over the United States, Britain and Japan, where
policy rates remain at record lows.	
 The euro slid around 20 percent against the dollar between
November 2009 and the middle of last year, but has been on a
broadly appreciating trend since then.	
 Against the dollar, the single currency hit a five-month
high against of $1.4269 on trading platform EBS earlier on
Monday, having gained a lift from some stop-loss buying, traders
said, and was later buying around $1.4230 .	
 ""Coming into the ECB meeting this week, we have to
anticipate further euro gains,"" said Todd Elmer, currency
strategist at Citi in Singapore.	
 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economic
assessment this week, which is likely to weigh on the yen. The
currency has been under pressure since a rare coordinated G7
intervention to weaken it last month.	
 Market players have even started talking about a return of
the yen ""carry trade"", the strategy of using cheap yen loans to
fund investments in higher yielding assets or currencies.	
 U.S. crude oil CLc1> edged up 0.4 percent to $108.34 a
barrel, having risen as high as $108.74 earlier in the session,
while Brent crude  was up 0.4 percent at $119.15. Gold
traded around $1,430 an ounce.	
 ""We have supply concerns which we haven't had for the last
few years and this is mostly related to Libya now,"" said John
Vautrain of energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz. ""The tension
has disrupted crude supplies, and that is affecting Europe."" 
 Japanese government bond 10-year futures were little changed
ahead of a 2.2 trillion yen auction on Tuesday, seen as a litmus
test of investor appetite in the new financial year, while the
benchmark 10-year yield rose 1.5 basis point to 1.29 percent.

 By Chizu Nomiyama and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 4 (Reuters) - Japan warned on Sunday it could
take months to stop radiation leaking from a nuclear plant
crippled by a huge earthquake and tsunami three weeks ago, while
voters said a coalition would better handle the crisis and
post-quake recovery effort.	
 An aide to embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the
government's priority was to stop radiation leaks which were
scaring the public and hindering work on cooling overheated
nuclear fuel rods.	
 ""We have not escaped from a crisis situation, but it is
somewhat stabilised,"" said Goshi Hosono, a ruling party lawmaker
and aide to Kan.	
 ""How long will it take to achieve (the goal of stopping the
radiation leakage)? I think several months would be one target,""
Hosono said on a nationwide Fuji TV programme on Sunday.	
 In the face of the prolonged crisis, nearly two-thirds of
Japanese voters believe the ruling Democratic Party should join
hands with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), a
Yomiuri newspaper poll showed, potentially warming lawmakers in
both camps to the scheme.	
 Kan last month invited Sadakazu Tanigaki, head of the LDP,
to join the cabinet as deputy premier for disaster relief, but
Tanigaki rejected the offer.	
 
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO)
found a crack in a concrete pit at its No.2 reactor in the
Fukushima Daiichi complex at the weekend, generating readings of
1,000 millisieverts of radiation per hour in the air inside. 
 The leaks did not stop after concrete was poured into the
pit, and TEPCO turned to water-absorbent polymers to prevent any
more contaminated water from flowing out.	
 The latest effort to stop radioactive water entering the
Pacific started on Sunday afternoon.	
 ""We were hoping the polymers would function like diapers but
are yet to see a visible effect,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a
deputy director general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency.	
 Officials believe the crack may be one source of the
radiation leaks that have hobbled efforts to control the
six-reactor complex and sent radiation levels in the sea to
4,000 times the legal limit.	
 Nishiyama said three of the six reactors were now generally

 * Reserves fell to $33.2 bln at end-February
(Adds detail, background)
 CAIRO, April 3 (Reuters) - Egypt's deputy Central Bank
governor said the bank had no target for the Egyptian pound and
the level of the currency would depend on supply and demand,
state news agency MENA reported on Sunday.
""The central bank's strategy is clear,"" MENA cited Hisham
Ramez as saying. ""Our goal is not the price, but leaving it to
supply and demand.""
Ramez said the central bank would ""intervene firmly"" if
speculators target the pound, as it did on Feb. 8 during
protests that led to the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak.
 Ramez said last month the Central Bank was prepared to allow
the pound to fall gradually in coming months if demand for the
currency were to decrease, and that it was not targeting a
specific exchange rate.
 On Feb. 8 the Central Bank intervened in the market to prop
up the pound, helping the local currency to strengthen against
the dollar for the first time since the eruption of political
protests on Jan. 25. 
 It had last intervened directly in early 2009 in the wake of
the global financial crisis, it said.
 Before the revolt, the central bank had foreign currency
reserves of $36 billion, falling to $33.2 billion at the end of
February, said Ramez, owing to a balance of payments deficit
caused by a decline in tourism and other revenues.
 A central bank statement in March estimated that the balance
of payments would show a deficit of $3 billion in the Jan-March
quarter compared with a surplus of about $557 million in the
Oct-Dec quarter. Ramez added that he expected reserves to
fall further, without giving a figure, adding that the number
would be announced within days.
 The pound was trading at 5.962 to the dollar at 1344 GMT.

 By Chizu Nomiyama and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 3 (Reuters) - Japan's government warned on
Sunday it may take months to stop radiation leaking from a
nuclear plant crippled by a huge earthquake and tsunami three
weeks ago, as more bodies were recovered in devastated areas of
northeast Japan.	
 An aide to embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the
government's priority was to stop radiation leaks which were
scaring the public and hindering work on cooling overheated
nuclear fuel rods.	
 ""We have not escaped from a crisis situation, but it is
somewhat stabilised,"" said Goshi Hosono, a ruling party lawmaker
and aide to Kan.	
 ""How long will it take to achieve (the goal of stopping the
radiation leakage)? I think several months would be one target,""
Hosono said on a nationwide Fuji TV programme on Sunday.	
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO)
found a crack in a concrete pit at its No.2 reactor in the
Fukushima Daiichi complex at the weekend, generating readings of
1,000 millisieverts of radiation per hour in the air inside. 
 The leaks did not stop after concrete was poured into the
pit, and TEPCO turned to water-absorbent polymers to prevent any
more contaminated water from going out.	
 The latest effort to staunch the flow of radioactive water
into the Pacific started on Sunday afternoon. Workers then
topped the polymers with more concrete.	
 ""We were hoping the polymers would function like diapers but
are yet to see a visible effect,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama,
deputy director general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency.	
 
 Officials believe the crack could be one source of the
radiation leaks that have hobbled efforts to control the
six-reactor complex and sent radiation levels in the sea soaring
to 4,000 times the legal limit.	
 The battle to cool overheated reactors and avoid dangerous
meltdowns of the highly radioactive fuel rods has seen workers
hose saltwater into reactors, but this has left the facility
awash with contaminated saltwater, preventing workers getting
closer to the reactors.	
 Nishiyama said fresh water was now being pumped into No. 1,
2 and 3 reactors using external power, which was more stable
than the emergency diesel generators previously being used.	
 He said the three reactors were now generally stable.	
 
 PM UNDER PRESSURE	
 The 9.0 magnitude quake and tsunami on March 11 has left
nearly 28,000 people dead or missing and Japan's northeast coast
a splintered wreck. The disaster has hit economic production and
left a damages bill which may top $300 billion.	
 After a three day intensive air and sea search by thousands
of U.S. and Japanese forces another 77 bodies were recovered,
Kyodo news agency said on Sunday.	
 Prime Minister Kan is under intense pressure to steer Japan
through its worst crisis since World War Two, but after three
weeks many Japanese are angry that the humanitarian disaster
seems to have taken a back seat to the nuclear crisis.	
 Unpopular and under pressure to quit or call a snap poll
before the disaster, Kan has been criticised for his crisis
management.	
 When Kan visited the devastated fishing port of
Rikuzentakata on Saturday, survivors struggling to rebuild their
lives complained that he had not visited them earlier.	
 More than 163,710 people are living in shelters, with more

area the nuclear plant, and another 136,000 people living a
further 10 km out have been told to leave or stay indoors.	
 Harrowing stories are still emerging of just what happened
on the fateful afternoon of March 11.	
 Civil servant Takako Suzuki, 40, narrowly escaped when water
rose to within a few inches from the ceiling of an evacuation
centre she had rushed to. ""I was thinking 'if the water rises a
little bit, I'm finished' - but fortunately the water suddenly
stopped rising and began receding,"" she said.	
 Suzuki spent a night huddled with 11 other survivors in the
deep water, bodies floating around them. [ID:L3E7F300G]

963,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2011 09:48PM ET</span>",Radiation worries hit Japan's farmers hard," By David Dolan	
 FUKUSHIMA CITY, Japan April 3 (Reuters) - On his farm on the
rural outskirts of Fukushima City, 73-year-old Akio Abiko digs
up burdock roots and worries about the future.	
 For now, he is donating the roots to a nearby evacuee
centre, to garnish rice and help feed those who have fled from
the crippled Daiichi nuclear plant about 70 kilometres (53
miles)away.	
 But Abiko and other local farmers wonder if anyone outside
this part of northeast Japan will ever again want to buy produce
from Fukushima.	
 Abiko used to sell carrots, potatoes and other vegetables
from his 3,000 tsubo (9,900 square metre) farm to Tokyo. But the
chances of that now look unlikely. 
 ""Grown in Fukushima"" has become a warning label for those
nervous of radiation which has already been found in some
vegetables close to the nuclear plant savaged by last month's
earthquake and tsunami.	
 ""There is no way we will be able to sell anything,"" he said.
""People in Tokyo are just too sensitive about this kind of
thing.""	
 A group of farmers came to Tokyo from Fukushima at the
weekend, using Geiger counters to show their produce was safe.	
 Japan's worst crisis since World War II, with the
authorities still trying to bring the damaged reactors under
control, has sparked widespread fears about the safety of its
food. 
 The radiation worries are likely to put a further squeeze on
farmers in northeast Japan, where the economy has been on a
steady decline for years, hit by a falling birthrate and a
rapidly ageing population.	
 Japan is already home to some of the world's most demanding
consumers, who inspect freshness, quality of packaging and place
of origin with almost religious zeal.	
 Even the most run-down markets separate produce by the place
where it was grown. At a modest fruit stand in a Fukushima truck
stop, all the produce was clearly labeled: apples from Aomori,
bananas from the Philippines, mushrooms from Yamagata.	
 
 JUST KEEP WORKING	
 When asked about the outlook for business this year, Takao
Watanabe leans against his white truck and just laughs. The
apple and peach trees around him show little signs of fruit, but
he already knows the outcome.	
 ""This year will be no good. Just because it is from
Fukushima."" 
 The 52-year-old Watanabe owns an orchard not far from
Abiko's farm. He used to sell more than half of the fruit
outside Fukushima.	
 ""You can't worry about it. That won't make it any better.
There's not a damn thing we can do except keep working.""	
 Fukushima produced just a sliver of the total carrots and
radishes harvested in Japan in 2008, according to the latest
data available from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries. But, it harvested 4 percent of all the apples that
year and a whopping 20 percent of all the peaches.	
 Some consumers in Fukushima are supporting their local
farmers, for now.	
 ""I think the vegetables are still okay, and I'm still buying
them,"" said 53-year-old Takashi Endo, who carried a bag full of
vegetables out of small market run by Japan's union of
agricultural cooperatives in Koriyama City, about 60 km from the
reactor.	
 ""But I'm worried about the long-term effects. I'm concerned
about the next harvest of peaches and apples.""	
 Unlike a standard supermarket, those run by agricultural
cooperatives are even more precise in their labelling, breaking
down the place of origin to smaller districts.	
 That is enough to reassure 70-year-old Takashi Uchida, who
walked out of the Koriyama shop with a large radish tucked under
his arm.	
 As long he avoids districts close to the Fukushima plant, he
feels secure, he said.	
 Watanabe reckons the next three years will be lean ones.	
 ""We're just going to have to tough it out until everyone
forgets about this.""

 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Chisa Fujioka
 TOKYO, April 3 (Reuters) - Japanese officials grappling on
Sunday to end the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl
were focusing on a crack in a concrete pit that was leaking
radiation into the ocean from a crippled reactor.
 Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) <9501.T> said it had found a
crack in the pit at its No.2 reactor in Fukushima, generating
readings 1,000 millisieverts of radiation per hour in the air
inside the pit. [ID:nL3E7F2039]
 ""With radiation levels rising in the seawater near the
plant, we have been trying to confirm the reason why, and in
that context, this could be one source,"" said Hidehiko

Agency (NISA), said on Saturday.
 He cautioned, however: ""We can't really say for certain

 Leakage did not stop even after concrete was poured into the
pit, and Tokyo Electric is now planning to use water-absorbent
polymer to prevent contaminated water from leaking out into the
sea.
 Officials from the utility said checks of the other five
reactors found no cracks.
 Nishiyama said that to cool the damaged reactor, NISA was
looking at alternatives to pumping in water, including an
improvised air conditioning system, spraying the reactor fuel
rods with vaporized water or using the plant's cleaning system.
 PM UNDER PRESSURE
 As the disaster that has left more than 27,000 dead or
missing dragged into a fourth week, Prime Minister Naoto Kan
toured devastated coastal towns in northern Japan on Saturday,
offering refugees government support for rebuilding homes and
livelihoods.
 ""It will be kind of a long battle, but the government will
be working hard together with you until the end,"" Kyodo news
agency quoted him as telling people in a shelter in
Rikuzentakata, a fishing port flattened by the tsunami which
struck on March 11 after a massive earthquake.
 Unpopular and under pressure to quit or call a snap poll
before the disaster, Kan has been criticised for his management
of the humanitarian and nuclear crisis. Some tsunami survivors
said he came to visit them too late.
 Kan also entered the 20-km (12-mile) evacuation zone and
visited J-village just inside the zone, a sports facility
serving as the headquarters for emergency teams trying to cool
the six-reactor Fukushima Daiichi plant.
 Operators of the plant are no closer to regaining control of
damaged reactors, as fuel rods remain overheated and high levels
of radiation are flowing into the sea.
 Japan is facing a damages bill which may top $300 billion --
the world's biggest from a natural disaster.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday the
Japanese economy would take a short-term hit and it could not
rule out further intervention for the yen. [ID:nEBE7DA00J]
 The consequences for the world's third largest economy have
already seen manufacturing slump to a two-year low. Power
outages and quake damage have hit supply chains and production.
 Hundreds of thousands remain homeless, sheltering in
evacuation centres, as the death toll from the disaster rises.
 Thousands of Japanese and U.S. soldiers on Saturday
conducted a search for bodies using dozens of ships and
helicopters to sweep across land still under water along the
northeast coast. The teams hope when a large spring tide recedes
it will make it easier to spot bodies.
 Radiation 4,000 times the legal limit has been detected in
seawater near the Daiichi plant and a floating tanker was to be
towed to Fukushima to store contaminated seawater. But until the
plant's internal cooling system is reconnected radiation will
flow from the plant.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2011 10:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-IMF denies pressing Greece to restructure debt," * IMF supports Greek government's position
 * Greek finance minister says ""no chance"" of restructuring
 
 (recasts with IMF denial of Der Spiegel report)
 WASHINGTON/BERLIN, April 2 (Reuters) - The International
Monetary Fund on Saturday denied a report in German magazine Der
Spiegel that it was privately pressing Greece to restructure its
debt.
 ""As we have said consistently, the IMF supports the Greek
government's position of no debt restructuring and its
determination to fully service its debt obligations. Any reports
claiming otherwise are wrong,"" an IMF spokeswoman told Reuters.
 Without citing any sources, Der Spiegel reported that the
IMF had reversed its previous opposition to the idea of a Greek
restructuring and now believed one was necessary soon.
 It wrote that senior IMF officials were recommending this to
European governments because Greece's debt mountain was now
roughly one-and-a-half times its annual economic output.
Early in March, IMF European Director Antonio Borges told
reporters he was ""confident that Greek debt is sustainable"",
adding that the Greeks had made ""quite a bit of progress on
their banks"" as well.
 But since the IMF now believes current measures no longer
suffice, it would like to see interest rates on Greek sovereign
debt lowered, maturities extended or the amount of principal
which Greece has to repay cut, Der Spiegel said.
 European governments and the IMF are jointly contributing to
and administering Greece's 110 billion euro ($155 billion)
bailout, so a split between them on policy could be damaging to
Greece's prospects for recovery.
 Greek and European officials have long insisted that Greece
can recover without restructuring its debt, and that even
discussing a restructuring now would be counter-productive by
damaging banks across Europe and causing panic in markets.
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou, speaking to
Reuters at a conference in Italy on Saturday, responded to the
Der Spiegel report by saying: ""There is absolutely no chance of
a restructuring of Greek debt.""
 He added, ""People (who talk about a restructuring) fail to
understand that the costs would much outweigh the benefits.""
 European Commission spokesman Jens Mester said: ""All support
measures are in place, and there is no reason now to start
thinking of this possibility of restructuring Greece's debt.""
 Der Spiegel reported that the IMF was still not willing to
call openly for a Greek restructuring out of fear this could
increase market pressure on Portugal. Portuguese bond yields
have soared in the last several weeks because investors think
Lisbon may soon be forced to seek a bailout.
 Many investors and analysts think an eventual Greek
restructuring may be inevitable. Cutting its credit rating of
Cyprus on Wednesday, Standard and Poor's cited an ""increasing
likelihood that the Greek government will restructure its debt"".
 Former European Central Bank chief economist Otmar Issing
told Der Spiegel last month that Greece's sovereign debt would
have to be restructured as soon as other euro zone countries
were out of danger.
 Before any restructuring, however, Greece may try another
strategy. Papaconstantinou said on Wednesday that Athens might
use some proceeds from state asset sales to buy back outstanding
bonds from the market; since market prices of its debt have
dropped sharply below face value, this could have the effect of
a restructuring in lightening Greece's debt load without
requiring Athens to conduct difficult talks with creditors.

 Prime Minister Naoto Kan spoke with refugees living in a
makeshift camp in the fishing village of Rikuzentakata,
levelled by the tsunami which struck on March 11 when Japan was
rocked by a massive earthquake, leaving 28,000 dead and
missing.
 ""It will be kind of a long battle, but the government will
be working hard together with you until the end. I want
everyone to do their best, too,"" Kyodo news agency quoted Kan
as telling one survivor in a school that is now an evacuation
shelter by Japan's shattered northeast coast.
 But some survivors were angry Kan took three weeks to
visit, accusing the government of doing little to help them
rebuild their lives amongst the twisted rubble.
 ""The timing of his visit is too late,"" said Ryoko Otsubo.
""I wish he had visited this place earlier. I wanted him to see
the piles of debris where there were no roads. Now the roads
are cleaned.""
 Despite its tsunami seawalls, Rikuzentakata was flattened
into a wasteland of mud and debris and many of its 23,000
residents killed or injured, some swept away by the waves.
 ""A person that used to have a house near the coast told me
'Where am I supposed to build a house after this?', so I
encouraged this person and said the government will provide
support until the end,"" Kan told reporters.
 Unpopular and under pressure to quit or call a snap poll
before the disaster, Kan has been criticised for his management
of Japan's humanitarian and nuclear crisis and his leadership
remains in question.
 ""There are some evacuation centres that lack electricity
and water. There are people who can't even go look for the
dead. I want him to pay attention to them,"" Kyodo quoted Kazuo
Sato, a 45-year-old fisherman, as saying.
 Kan later entered the 20-km (12-mile) evacuation zone and
visited J-village just inside the zone, a sports facility
serving as the headquarters for emergency teams trying to cool
the six-reactor Fukushima Daiichi plant.
 ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
 After three weeks, operators of the plant are no closer to
regaining control of damaged reactors, as fuel rods remain
overheated and high levels of radiation flow into the sea.
 TEPCO, Asia's largest power company, has seen its shares
lose 80 percent -- $32 billion in market value -- since the
disaster.
 Japan is facing a damages bill which may top $300 billion
-- the world's biggest from a natural disaster.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday the

 The IMF is set to cut its 2011 forecast for Japanese growth
when it unveils updated figures on April 11 in its World
Economic Outlook, said IMF Japan mission chief Mahmood Pradhan.
 Japan's central bank is expected to revise down its
economic assessment when it meets on April 6-7 in the wake of
the crisis.
 The consequences for the world's third largest economy have
already seen manufacturing slump to a two-year low. Power
outages and quake damage have hit supply chains and production.
 There has been growing talk of a coalition between the
ruling Democratic Party of Japan and the main opposition
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to tackle the aftermath of the
crisis.
 But there has been no agreement and the Yomiuri newspaper
said some in the LDP would likely insist Kan step down first.
 The government has already been battling the opposition to
get laws in place to make the new budget, from April 1,
workable.
 Kan wants an extra budget soon for reconstruction which
would also need help from opposition parties to function.
 RADIATION BATTLE CONTINUES
 Hundreds of thousands remain homeless, sheltering in

 It could take years, possibly decades, to make safe the
area around the plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.
 With its president, Masataka Shimizu, in hospital, an
enormous compensation bill looming and mounting criticism of
both its handling of the crisis and prior safety preparations,
TEPCO may need state help, according to media reports.
 Kan has all but ruled out nationalising TEPCO but some sort
of injection of public funds looks inevitable.
 Standard & Poor's on Friday cut its long-term rating on
TEPCO by three notches to ""BBB+"", in its second downgrade on
the electric utility in as many weeks.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2011 05:40AM ET</span>","""BRICS"" to talk economic coordination, not yuan-China"," By Ben Blanchard	
 BEIJING, April 2 (Reuters) - Leaders from five of the
world's top emerging economies will discuss a coordinated stance
on economic issues such as commodity price fluctuations, but the
yuan's exchange rate is off the agenda, a senior Chinese
diplomat said on Saturday.	
 The mid-April ""BRICS"" summit will gather leaders from China,
Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa in the southern Chinese
beach resort of Sanya.	
 The summit is unlikely to achieve much concrete, though it
will give the world's big rising economies a venue to coordinate
views on global financial reforms, commodity prices and other
shared concerns.	
 ""The BRICS countries have similar concerns or stances on
important questions like the global economy, international
finance and development,"" Assistant Chinese Foreign Minister Wu
Hailong told a news conference.	
 ""We hope all sides can strengthen coordination and mutual
cooperation on reform of the international currency system,
commodity price fluctuations, climate change and sustainable
development,"" he added.	
 China hoped the summit would in particular be able to
coalesce views on commodity price fluctuations ahead of the G20
summit in Cannes, France, later this year, Wu said.	
 ""This is a topic at the G20 summit in Cannes and ... the
leaders of the five countries will exchange views on this,"" he
added. ""We hope that the five countries' leaders can have a
joint stance on this issue and reach a broad consensus.""	
 But Wu said the Chinese currency's exchange rate would not
be talked about at the Sanya summit. Some countries say China
keeps the yuan artificially undervalued to help boost
Chinese exports.	
 ""The renminbi's exchange rate is not on the agenda for
discussion,"" he said, repeating China's standard line that its
currency was not the cause of global imbalances.	
 China's hard work at perfecting the yuan's exchange rate
mechanism was ""clear for all to see"", he added. Renmibi is the
yuan's formal name.	
 Brazilian government officials have said they want to
discuss the issue of the yuan, whose cheap value they say has
helped fuel a flood of Chinese imports and deteriorated Brazil's
trade balance. [ID:nN28214216]	
 The BRICS group has emerged as a loose united front to press
the rich Western economies, especially the United States, which
has traditionally dominated global diplomacy. 
 Yet there are many disparities among the BRICS member
countries, and the past two summits of the evolving group have
not achieved much. This time, too, strains over China's currency
policies and trade surpluses could make real agreement even
harder to reach. 
 The leaders may also discuss Libya and the broader situation
in the Middle East. 
 ""It would be natural if the leaders discussed this issue,
but at the moment we have not heard that any country has said
they wish to make a dedicated statement on it,"" Wu said. 
 China, with Russia, India, Brazil and other developing
countries have condemned the U.S.-led air strikes on Libyan
forces. South Africa, on the other hand, voted in favour of the
United Nations Security Council resolution authorising the air
strikes.

 * IMF likely to cut 2011 growth forecast for Japan
 * Repatriation flows won't be big driver of yen
 By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely
to maintain its easy monetary policy stance when it meets next
week, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on
Friday.
 Mahmood Pradhan, IMF mission chief to Japan, said the
devastating March 11 earthquake would have a short-term impact
on Japanese growth, although reconstruction efforts could bring
a sharp recovery next year.
 The IMF is set to cut its 2011 forecast for Japanese growth
when it unveils updated figures on April 11 in its World
Economic Outlook, he added.
 ""It would be appropriate of the BOJ to maintain a very
accommodative stance,"" Pradhan told Reuters Insider. ""I think
that is what they will do.""
 Japan's central bank is expected to revise down its
economic assessment when it meets on April 6-7 in the wake of
the nuclear crisis. For now, the dominant market view is that
it will stand pat on monetary policy although the central bank
has expressed its readiness to ease policy if the quake impact
threatens Japan's fragile economy.
 Pradhan said there had been an impressive coordinated
effort by Japanese agencies to address the immediate
humanitarian in the aftermath of the disaster.
 He said short-term movements in the Japanese yen were hard
to explain, but dismissed the role of speculators in driving up
the currency.
 ""I think the yen in the longer term sense is where it
should be,"" Pradhan said, adding, ""The yen reflects the
underlying performance of Japan's economy.""
 He said there was no evidence that the repatriation of
funds to pay for reconstruction costs was driving up the
currency.
 ""Our assessment is that the yen repatriation flows over the
medium term will not make a material difference to value of the
yen,"" Pradhan said. ""Put it another way, we do not see
repatriation flows to be the big driver of the yen.""

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. blue chips surged to an
early 3-year high on Friday as encouraging jobs growth kicked
the second quarter off to a strong start for world stocks,
even as a Fed official's cautious views on the economy hurt the
dollar.
 Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> hit its
highest level since June 2008 after the government reported a
second straight month of robust job gains in March.
 Oil closed at peaks not seen since the third quarter of
2008, while gold slipped as investors' appetite for risk grew.
 But U.S. Treasuries rose after New York Federal Reserve
Bank President William Dudley said recovery in the economy and
labor market still lagged the central bank's expectations, and
interest rates were unlikely to rise so soon, as some in the
market feared.
 The Labor Department said a total of 216,000 nonfarm jobs
were added in March, well above the 190,000 expected in a
Reuters poll. It also said revised January and February figures
showed more jobs than previously reported. The unemployment
rate for March fell to a two-year low of 8.8 percent. For
details, see [ID:nNOAT00477]
 JOB NUMBERS WIDELY CHEERED
 Notwithstanding Dudley's comments, the job numbers were
widely cheered by the market.
 ""We are growing, we are getting more profitable, we are
going to see more jobs. That means consumers are going to do
better. That is the better picture to look at,"" said Marc Pado,
U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San
Francisco.
 The Dow closed up 56.99 points, or 0.46 percent, at
12,376.72.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 6.56 points, or
0.49 percent, to 1,332.39. The S&P 500 managed to push through
a technical level it has been unable to sustain in the past,
but it may need help to break to new multiyear
highs.
 The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added
up 8.53 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,789.60.
 Global stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, rose 0.7 percent.
 The dollar fell against the euro and a broad basket of
currencies after Dudley, one of the Fed's key policymakers,
signaled further support for the economy.
 Markets have been getting mixed signals from various Fed
officials over the past two weeks on growth and whether the
central bank is keen to keep the easy monetary policy it
maintained since the financial crisis or is looking to raise
interest rates.
 Dudley said he saw no reason yet to reverse course.
 ""I would be surprised if we didn't finish the full QE2,"" he
said, referring to the central bank's $600 billion stimulus
program, which some other Fed officials have indicated could be
ended prematurely.
 ""If they indicated they were going to continue with QE2,
then that is a lot of the market,"" said Terry Morris, senior
equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust Company in
Reading, Pennsylvania. ""A lot of good news, a lot of momentum
and the Fed is accommodative.""
 ECB RATE HIKE FEAR HURTS DOLLAR
 Another factor that hurt the dollar was growing belief that
the European Central Bank will be the first central bank to
raise interest rates at a policy meeting next Thursday.
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.4231 , well off a
$1.4059 low. Traders said stop-loss orders around $1.4060 led
to some euro buying.
 The single currency has risen some 6 percent in 27 days --
from a low of $1.3428 on Feb. 14 to $1.4249 last week, the 2011
high. Traders said a break of that level could prompt a run at
$1.4283, the Nov. 4 peak.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which pits the greenback
against a basket of major currencies, was off 0.02 percent at
75.842.
 OIL, TREASURIES UP; GOLD DOWN
 London Brent crude futures for May  finished up
$1.34 at $118 a barrel. U.S. crude  settled up $1.22, or
1.14 percent, at $107.94 a barrel, its highest close since
September 2008.
 U.S. Treasuries erased early losses almost entirely on
Dudley's remarks.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
4/32 in price for the day, yielding 3.46 percent after being
down 10/32 right after the bullish March employment report.
U.S. federal fund futures were slightly lower, with the January
2012  contract down 0.01 percent at 99.6600.
 Safe-haven gold slipped as the jobs data increased
investors' risk appetite. Spot gold  , which tracks
trades in bullion, dropped 0.1 percent to trade above $1,428 an
ounce, off its low at $1,412.55 hit earlier in the session.
U.S. gold futures for June delivery  finished down 0.7
percent at $1,428.10 an ounce.

 By Pedro da Costa and Jonathan Cable
 WASHINGTON/LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. and European
factory growth eased slightly in March but remained at levels
consistent with a brisk recovery, while America's jobless rate
retreated for a fourth straight month, data on Friday showed.
 Chinese and Indian firms ratcheted up their production,
skirting any major effects from Japan's devastating earthquake
and tsunami thus far.
 Worryingly for European policymakers, sustained growth in
orders allowed eurozone manufacturers to pass on the costs of
soaring raw materials to customers at a pace not seen since at
least late 2002.
 The inflation outlook in the United States was less clear
cut. Rising gasoline prices have raised some eyebrows, but
hiring remains anemic and wages stagnant, making an upward
price spiral less likely.
 ""The level of slack in the labor market remains great
enough not to allow inflation to remain a problem for the
(Federal Reserve) in the next year,"" said Lena Komileva, head
of G10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London.
 ""The debate surrounding the Fed's outlook is likely to move
towards the level of accommodation that the economy needs,
rather than about the need to tighten policy,"" she said.
 The U.S. jobless rate dropped to 8.8 percent in March. It
has now fallen a full percentage point since November, the
biggest four-month decline since the period ending February
1984. At the same time, the Institute for Supply Management's
survey of U.S. manufacturing sentiment dipped slightly but
remained at an elevated 61.2.
 The ISM's employment measure also slipped, while prices
paid reached their highest level since July 2008.
 ""There was some cooling in the details of the ISM survey in
March relative to February, but overall the ISM has looked very
strong throughout the first quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an
economist at JPMorgan.
 In Europe, Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index dipped to 57.5 last month from February's near
11-year high, marking the 18th month above the 50 mark that
divides growth from contraction.
 The output price index rose to its highest level since
Markit began tracking it in November 2002 and, coupled with
data on Thursday that showed euro zone inflation at 2.6 percent
in March, will cement expectations of a rate rise next week.
 ""They are still at very robust levels and pointing to
healthy growth in the industrial sector, suggesting that the
euro zone recovery will continue in the near term and gain some
steam,"" said Ben May at Capital Economics.
 Similar surveys of firms in Asia's major economies showed
oil prices had thus far done little to dent growth, even though
China's outlook was clouded by signs of disruptions to trade
with Japan.
 A pair of China PMIs showed factories were growing
moderately rather than booming, and while some economists
warned of a continued slowdown, few thought slowing production
would slam the brakes on the world's second largest economy.
 China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI), compiled
by the government, rose to 53.4 in March from a six-month low
of 52.2. A comparable survey published by HSBC steadied near
seven-month lows at 51.8.
 ""It's growing at a slow and steady speed as tighter
monetary policy impacts,"" said Stephen Green, an economist at
Standard Chartered in Shanghai. ""I'm not overly worried about
growth.""
 In India, the mood among manufacturers was more upbeat. An
HSBC-sponsored PMI there compiled from a survey of around 500
firms held steady at a four-month high of 57.9.
 British manufacturing growth weakened from a survey record
high the prior month after the inflow of orders slowed sharply
but the prices charged index hit a survey record, showing
manufacturers' pricing power is rising.
 RESTIVE RATES
 The European Central Bank has already signaled it intends
to raise interest rates next week from a record low of 1.0
percent and the Bank of England, facing inflation more than
double its target, may follow suit as soon as May.
 And China, worried that rising prices could stir social
unrest, has steadily tightened policy since October, when it
declared that fighting inflation was a priority.
 The PMI surveys suggest this may be working. While prices
climbed, they did so at a slower pace and most analysts expect
China to raise interest rates at least once more this year. A
government researcher said on Friday a rate rise could happen
as soon as this month.
 In the United States, hawkish comments from a number Fed
officials has caused some investors to wonder whether the
central bank might begin to raise rates by year-end. However,
such musings may prove short-lived if Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke, slated to speak in Atlanta on Monday, hints that he
favors maintaining policy accommodation for longer.

 (Updates with Fitch downgrade of Portugal)
 By Andrei Khalip and Carmel Crimmins
 LISBON/DUBLIN, April 1 (Reuters) - Credit rating agency
Fitch downgraded Portugal on Friday saying the debt-laden
country needed a bailout, while rival agency S&P cut Ireland's
rating after bank stress tests revealed another black hole.
 Despite a successful Portuguese debt sale on Friday, Fitch
slashed its rating to the lowest investment grade rank of BBB-.
 ""The severity of the downgrade by three notches mainly
reflects Fitch's concern that timely external support is much
less likely in the near term following yesterday's announcement
of general elections to take place on 5 June,"" said Douglas
Renwick, Director in Fitch's Sovereign Ratings Group.
 ""The agency views external support as necessary to bolster
the credibility of Portugal's fiscal consolidation and economic
reform effort, as well as secure its financing position,""
Renwick said in a statement.
 Earlier Standard & Poor's became the last of the three major
rating agencies to strip Ireland of its 'A' rating. However, the
one notch cut and stable outlook was less severe than feared and
it gave the thumbs up to stress tests which on Thursday showed
its four troubled banks needed a further 24 billion euros to be
properly capitalised.
 Portugal sold 1.645 billion euros of short-dated bonds on
Friday, but had to offer an interest rate of 5.79 percent, lower
than other current market rates but 2.5 percentage points more
than it paid at similar auctions last year.
 Lisbon is now having to pay a higher interest rate to borrow
money for the next 15 months than Spain is paying to raise funds
for 10 years -- a clear indication of how much risk investors
now attach to Portugal.
 Portugal's 10-year bond yields went on rising despite the
smooth auction, hitting 8.77 percent, up more than a percentage
point in the past week. Ireland's reached 10.1 percent, nearly
6.5 percentage points higher than benchmark German Bunds.
 Richard McGuire, a debt strategist at Rabobank, said that
while Friday's auction showed Lisbon could still tap the markets
if needed, the trend was bleak.
 ""(Portugal) is fundamentally insolvent -- i.e. it is clearly
in a situation where debt will have to be issued to cover
servicing costs, thereby resulting in a snowballing of
liabilities,"" he said.
 S&P, whose rubbishing of a previous ""final bill"" for
Ireland's banking sector sent the country's debt crisis into
overdrive last year, said the assumptions underlying the latest
round of tests of bank resilience were robust.
 But rival agency Fitch took the shine off S&P's modest
downgrade when it warned it could cut its BBB+ rating on the
back of weaker growth and a jump in the bank bailout costs.
 A Reuters poll of economists gave a consensus forecast of
just 0.5 percent growth in Ireland this year, well below the
official forecast of 1.7 percent and weaker than the 0.9 percent
pencilled in by the European Commission and IMF.
 
 GREEK MEMORIES
 Underscoring the tenuous nature of Portugal's finances, the
statistics agency had to restate the 2010 budget deficit on
Thursday, increasing the shortfall to 8.6 percent of gross
domestic product from 7.3 percent.
 The adjustment was down to methodology and will not affect
2011 figures, but still undermines broader confidence, reviving
memories of the Greek deficit revision of 2009 that lit the fuse
of the euro zone debt crisis.
 Financial markets are convinced Lisbon will have to ask the
European Union and International Monetary Fund for a bailout.
 However, caretaker Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates,
who resigned last week after parliament rejected his latest
spending cuts, has made it a point of honour not to accept
EU/IMF help.
 Portugal's president dissolved parliament on Thursday and
set June 5 as the date for the next polls, meaning the country
is effectively in limbo for two more months.
 While Portugal can probably go on funding itself for the
next eight weeks -- it has to refinance 4.3 billion euros ($6.1
billion) of debt in April and 4.9 billion in June -- the cost of
doing so is likely to go on being punitively high.
 
 IRISH BANK BILL
 The debt crisis in the euro zone has already consumed Greece
and Ireland and shows few signs of relenting.
 The 24 billion euros extra bank bill for Ireland, which
received an 85 billion euro package of aid from the EU and IMF
in November, was in line with market expectations and, coupled
with the European Central Bank's decision to suspend collateral
requirements for loans from Ireland, gave the Irish banking
sector a lift on Friday.
 The European Commission said it believed the stress tests
had been ""extremely rigorous"" and that there should now be no
more surprises lurking for the financial markets.
 But Ireland still has accumulated bank liabilities of nearly
45 percent of GDP and will have total debts of well over 100
percent of GDP if forecasts from the stress tests are right.
 If the European Central Bank raises interest rates next week
as expected, the impact on growth will be even greater in both
Ireland and Portugal, driving up debt-to-GDP ratios without the
debt increasing.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. blue chip stocks opened
the second quarter on Friday by hitting their highest level
since June 2008 as investor optimism rose after an upbeat U.S.
employment report.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> climbed above the
12,400 mark on views the U.S. economy is on a solid recovery
track.
 The government reported a second straight month of solid
job gains in March and a slight drop in the unemployment rate
to a 2-year low.
 The dollar initially rose against the euro after the report
but turned negative after a senior Federal Reserve official
cautioned against views the March job numbers might cause the
Fed to reverse course.
 A total of 216,000 nonfarm U.S. jobs were added in March,
well above the 190,000 expected in a Reuters poll, and January
and February figures were revised to show 7,000 more jobs than
previously reported. The unemployment rate fell to a two-year
low of 8.8 percent. For details, see [ID:nNOAT00477]
 Analysts said the data signaled that recovery in the
world's largest economy remained firmly on track.
 ""It's hard to argue with the case that we have further to
go in this bull market economic recovery cycle,"" said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC
in Albany, New York.
 Around 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 83.67 points, or 0.68 percent, The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 9.92 points, or 0.75
percent, at 1,335.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up
16.76 points, or 0.60 percent, at 2,797.83.
 Global stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, rose 0.92 percent.
 The improving jobs picture initially helped the U.S. dollar
gain against a basket of major currencies <.DXY >, as well as
the euro . The dollar stayed at 0.16 percent above other
majors. But the euro rebounded by midday and was up 0.2 percent
versus the greenback, trading above $1.4190.
 New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley said
economic recovery was not looking as good as a month ago, and
while jobs numbers were encouraging, he did not want to
overstate the growth.
 Markets have been getting mixed signals from various Fed
officials over the past two weeks on growth and whether the
central bank is keen to keep the easy monetary policy it has
maintained since the financial crisis or is looking to raise
interest rates soon.
 ""I would be surprised if we didn't finish the full QE2,""
Dudley said, referring to the central bank's $600 billion
buying program, which some other Fed officials have indicated
could be ended prematurely.
 OIL REBOUNDS
 While many analysts viewed the U.S. job figures as
encouraging, some expressed concern that rising energy and
commodity prices could squeeze investments in business
expansion, threatening the employment outlook.
 ""One has to wonder whether we'll see the pace of hiring
slow as a result,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist
at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.
 London Brent crude futures rose more than $1 per barrel to
$118.03 a barrel by 12:33 p.m EDT (1633 GMT) in choppy trading,
after the jobs report. Brent had risen 2.0 percent on Thursday,
hitting 2-1/2 year highs.
 U.S. copper's benchmark contract May  was down 1.2
percent at $4.2580 a lb.
 TREASURIES RISE
 U.S. Treasuries erased early losses after the remarks by
Dudley, who also said the nation was still ""very far away"" from
achieving the dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment
and price stability.
 ""One side of the Fed's mandate, falling unemployment, is
saying exit. The other side of their mandate, low core
inflation, is saying not so fast,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief
financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi UFJ in New
York.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were unchanged on the day,
yielding 3.47 percent after being down 10/32 right after the
employment report. U.S. federal fund futures were slightly
lower, with the January 2012 contract down 3 ticks at 99.645.
 Safe-haven gold  slipped as the jobs data boosted
investors' risk appetite. Spot gold, which tracks trades in
bullion, dropped 0.9 percent to $1,425.25 an ounce, off its low
at $1,412.55 hit earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures for
June delivery  fell 1 percent to $1,425.70.

 NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped
against the euro on Friday, with more losses likely over the
near-term given expectations that the European Central Bank
will soon tighten monetary policy, while the Federal Reserve
remains on hold.
 Despite a good March U.S. employment report, New York
Federal Reserve president William Dudley said the Fed was
""still very far away from achieving"" its dual mandate of
maximum sustainable employment and price stability.
 ""Dudley is taking a much more cautious view than the Fed
hawks that have been speaking over the last 24 hours, and
that's helped the euro,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""The hawks are known
quantities but Dudley is among the three policymakers at the
core of the FOMC.""

reason for the U.S. central bank to reverse course any time
soon, causing U.S. Treasuries prices to erase losses incurred

 The ECB is widely expected to be the first central bank to
raise rates at its policy meeting next Thursday.
 The euro was around $1.4197  at midsession in New
York, up 0.2 percent, well off the session low of $1.4059. A
trader said stop-loss orders between $1.4040 and $1.4060 and
the defense of an options barrier around $1.4060 had prompted
buying as the euro approached those levels.
 DOLLAR, EURO JUMP VERSUS YEN
 The U.S. dollar hit its highest level in more than six
months against the yen and was on pace to show its strongest
weekly gains since December 2009 as yield differentials favor
the greenback.
 Prior to the New York session, the dollar/yen  blew
past its 200-day moving average for the first time since June
2010. The dollar last traded up 1.3 percent at 84.22.
<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The euro  hit an 11-month high against the yen,
leaping 1.5 percent to 119.52.
 The Bank of Japan is widely expected to lag behind the
Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in raising
interest rates, especially in the wake of the March 11
earthquake and tsunami.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar <.DXY> was up
0.2 percent at 76.972.
 An improving U.S. economy bolsters the argument for tighter
monetary policy and should further widen dollar/yen yield
differentials. Investors are increasingly looking to sell the
yen and buy high-yielding currencies, called carry trades.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2011 12:32PM ET</span>",US biodiesel makers rap EU trade tariff extension," * U.S. biodiesel group says decision breaks EU law
 * Duties to hit all U.S. blends, some Canadian shipments
 * EU officials discussed risks of U.S. legal claim - source
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. biodiesel makers said on
Friday that a European Union decision to extend tariffs on
imported biodiesel blends was illegal, fuelling a transatlantic
battle for a share in the world's renewable energy market.
 On Thursday, EU government representatives backed a plan to
extend tariffs on evidence that U.S. exporters have either been
smuggling biodiesel to Europe via Canada or mixing it into
weaker blends to avoid high tariffs at EU borders, diplomatic,
EU and industry sources said. 
 ""We think this would be a bad decision that runs directly
counter to current EU law,"" said Manning Feraci, vice president
of federal affairs at the U.S. National Biodiesel Board, the
country's leading biodiesel industry group.
 ""We're waiting to get final confirmation of the decision and
will go from there.""
 The fight over EU biodiesel duties, which sliced U.S.
exports to less than a third of their 1.5 million tonne level
when they launched in 2009, highlights the global race for a
share of the world's booming renewable energy market.
 EU firms accuse U.S. producers of being involved in a
""splash and dash"" scheme, whereby they may import cheap
biodiesel from countries such as Brazil and add less than 5
percent of U.S. diesel. The producers then qualify for a subsidy
from Washington before exporting it to Europe.
 Sources said the extension, due to launch in May and apply
until 2014, was approved by 25 votes to two.
 
 LEGAL ROWS OVER BLENDS
 Specifically, the plan foresees tariffs of up to 400 euros
($566.40) per tonne of biodiesel on all U.S. blends, regardless
of strength, and some blends entering the EU from Canada in an
effort to fight tariff evasion, the sources told Reuters.
So far duties have hit only U.S.-shipped blends made up of at
least one fifth biodiesel. Exporters who can prove they have
always exported weaker blends than that - rather than making a
calculated switch - may be granted an exemption.
 Previously sources said the EU had backed away from slapping
the duty on weaker blends.
 Sources said EU diplomats approved extending the duties
after debating whether they risked U.S. legal action.
 ""The sense was that Canada wouldn't really mind the
extension, because it only affects the imports that are coming
from the United States,"" said a person familiar with the issue.
 ""The sense seemed to be that there was a higher risk of the
United States challenging the extension,"" the person added.
 An investigation into whether ports in Singapore had served
as illegal trans-shipment sites was dropped after finding too
little evidence that such smuggling was hurting EU industry.
 Canadian exporters BIOX Corp and Rothsay Biodiesel,

 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Chisa Fujioka	
 TOKYO, April 2 (Reuters) - Japan's prime minister made his
first visit to the country's tsunami-devastated region on
Saturday as the operator of the stricken Fukushima nuclear
complex said it had found radioactive water leaking into the sea
from a cracked concrete pit.	
In a discovery regulators said might explain the radioactive
water that has hobbled efforts to quell Japan's nuclear crisis,
Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) said the radiation in
the pit at its No.2 reactor in Fukushima measured 1,000
millisieverts per hour. [ID:nL3E7F2039]	
""With radiation levels rising in the seawater near the plant,
we have been trying to confirm the reason why, and in that
context, this could be one source,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama,
deputy head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.	
 He cautioned, however, ""We can't really say for certain
until we've studied the results.""	
 TEPCO is preparing to pour concrete into the pit to stop the
leak, added Nishiyama.

 Prime Minister Naoto Kan spoke with refugees living in a
makeshift camp in the fishing village of Rikuzentakata, levelled
by the tsunamis which struck on March 11 when Japan was rocked
by a massive earthquake, leaving 28,000 dead and missing.	
 ""It will be kind of a long battle, but the government will
be working hard together with you until the end. I want everyone
to do their best, too,"" Kan told one survivor in a school that
was now an evacuation shelter. 
 Despite its tsunami seawalls, Rikuzentaka was flattened into
a wasteland of mud and debris and most of its 23,000 residents
killed or injured, many swept away by the waves.	
 ""A person that used to have a house near the coast told me
'Where am I supposed to build a house after this?', so I
encouraged this person and said the government will provide
support until the end,"" Kan told reporters.	
 Unpopular and under pressure to quit or call a snap poll
before the disaster, Kan has been criticised for his management
of Japan's humanitarian and nuclear crisis and his leadership
remains in question.	
 ""There are some evacuation centres that lack electricity and
water. There are people who can't even go look for the dead. I
want him to pay attention to them,"" said Kazuo Sato, a
45-year-old fisherman.	
 Kan later entered the 20-km (12-mile) evacuation zone and
visited J-village just inside the zone, a sports facility
serving as the headquarters for emergency teams trying to cool
the six-reactor Fukushima Daiichi plant.

 ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES	
 After three weeks, operators of the plant are no closer to
regaining control of damaged reactors, as fuel rods remain
overheated and high levels of radiation flow into the sea.	
 TEPCO, Asia's largest power company, has seen its shares
lose 80 percent - $32 billion in market value - since the
disaster.	
 Japan is facing a damages bill which may top $300 billion --
the world's biggest from a natural disaster.	
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday the
Japanese economy would take a short-term hit and it could not
rule out further intervention for the yen. [ID:nEBE7DA00J]	
 The IMF is set to cut its 2011 forecast for Japanese growth
when it unveils updated figures on April 11 in its World
Economic Outlook, said IMF Japan mission chief Mahmood Pradhan.	
 Japan's central bank is expected to revise down its economic
assessment when it meets on April 6-7 in the wake of the crisis.	
 The consequences for the world's third largest economy have
already seen manufacturing slump to a two-year low. Power
outages and quake damage have hit supply chains and production.	
 There has been growing talk of a coalition between the
ruling Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) and the main opposition
Liberal Democratic Party to tackle the aftermath of the crisis.	
 But there has been no agreement and the Yomiuri newspaper
said opposition parties would likely insist Kan step down first.	
 The government has already been battling the opposition to
get laws in place to make the new budget, from April 1,
workable. Kan wants an extra budget soon for reconstruction
which would also need help from opposition parties to function.	
 
 RADIATION BATTLE CONTINUES	
 Hundreds of thousands remain homeless, sheltering in
evacuation centres, as the death toll from the disaster rises.	
 Thousands of Japanese and U.S. soldiers on Saturday
conducted a search for bodies using dozens of ships and
helicopters to sweep across land still under water along the
northeast coast. The teams hope when a large spring tide recedes
it will make it easier to spot bodies.	
 Radiation 4,000 times the legal limit has been detected in
seawater near the Daiichi plant and a floating tanker was to be
towed to Fukushima to store contaminated seawater. But until the
plant's internal cooling system is reconnected radiation will
flow from the plant.	
 ""We are trying to employ as many measures as possible (to
put the plant under control). We are holding high hopes (for
this storage),"" said a TEPCO official.	
 In its attempt to bring the plant under control, TEPCO is
looking for ""jumpers"" -- workers who, for payment of up to
$5,000 a shift, will rush into highly radioactive areas to do a
quick task before racing out as quickly as possible.	
 ""My company offered me 200,000 yen ($2,500) per day,"" one
subcontractor, unidentified but in his 30s, told Japan's Weekly
Post magazine. ""Ordinarily I'd consider that a dream job, but my
wife was in tears and stopped me, so I declined.""	
 TEPCO was also spraying resin onto radioactive dust in an
attempt to stop it from being carried in the wind.	
 ""We sprayed 2,000 litres over 500 square metres of land. We
plan to evaluate the result of the test spraying on April 2nd
and 3rd. It takes about 24 hours for this scattering-prevention
solution to get dried,"" said the official.	
 It could take years, possibly decades, to make safe the area
around the plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.	
 With its president, Masataka Shimizu, in hospital, an
enormous compensation bill looming and mounting criticism of
both its handling of the crisis and prior safety preparations,
TEPCO may need state help, according to media reports.	
 Kan has all but ruled out nationalising TEPCO but some sort
of injection of public funds looks inevitable.	
 Standard & Poor's on Friday cut its long-term rating on
TEPCO by three notches to ""BBB+"", in its second downgrade on the
electric utility in as many weeks.

 * Gbagbo departure would clear way for ample mid, main crops
 * ICE cocoa could fall as low as $2,600 - Rabobank analyst
 
 By David Brough and Jonathan Saul
 LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - Cocoa futures, which hit a
34-year peak last month, are likely to fall to levels seen
before Ivory Coast's election in November if forces loyal to
claimant Alassane Ouattara defeat presidential incumbent Laurent
Gbagbo.
 But the lifting of EU trade sanctions and a resumption of
shipments will take time as the new government seeks to win over
port officials and shippers to restart operations, potentially
limiting price declines.
 ICE cocoa futures slid to a 2-1/2-month low this week,
falling around 10 percent as breakthroughs in the fighting by
forces loyal to Ouattara, who won a Nov. 28 poll according to
U.N.-certified results, raised prospects that exports could be
freed.
 Cocoa trade is now at a standstill in Ivory Coast, which
accounts for more than a third of the world's supply.
 Analysts said investors who piled into long positions would
liquidate them if it seemed Gbagbo would lose power.
 Keith Flury, a soft commodities analyst with Rabobank, said
ICE cocoa futures could fall as low as $2,600 per tonne if
Gbagbo fell, but a long-term lack of investment in plantations
in Ivory Coast was likely to set a floor to prices.
 ""The best case scenario if Ouattara were installed would be
that the Ivorian mid-crop would be harvested and the main crop
(from October) would arrive on the market,"" Flury said.
 ""That would push prices lower, to levels not seen since
before the election.""
 Favourable weather has aided development of the mid-crop.
which is due to be harvested this month.
 ICE second-month cocoa, which was around $2,800 per tonne
before the bitterly disputed Ivorian elections, on Friday was at
$2,955, down $11 or 0.4 percent as fierce fighting spread across
Abidjan.
 Gary Mead, VM Group analyst and editor of Worldcrops.com,
said cocoa futures could fall further if the speed of change
were high in Ivory Coast.
 ""If the speed of change is not quick, we could see it
(price) staying relatively high,"" he added.
 
 EU SANCTIONS
 Even if Gbagbo loses power soon, EU sanctions that have
crippled trade in Ivory Coast could linger.
 The EU is the leading market for Ivorian cocoa. Annual
Ivorian imports into the EU, mainly cocoa, typically amount to
around 3 billion euros ($4.2 billion) by value.
 ""If the pro-Ouattara forces are able to maintain control,
there may well be an argument for the sanctions to be revised to
allow exports, but it will not happen overnight,"" said Michelle
Linderman, a partner with law firm Ince & Co.
 The capture by pro-Ouattara forces of San Pedro, which ships
half of the country's production, could kick-start the flow of
beans that dried up in January due to sanctions.
 ""In terms of legal constraints, the cocoa can move, but it
may take time. The problem for Ouattara is going to be that the
people in the south have overwhelmingly supported Gbagbo,"" said
J. Peter Pham, Africa director with the Atlantic Council, a U.S.
think-tank.
 ""Getting them and the people who are capable of making the
infrastructure run, the civil servants and others to cooperate
-- that is going to be a task.""
 Mead said it would also take time to assess the condition of
the cocoa stored in Ivory Coast before it could be shipped.
 One short-term risk is that beans now sitting in Ivorian
warehouses could rot, also propping up prices.
 Ship operators said even if sanctions were modified or
lifted, it would take time before shipments would resume
smoothly. Banks would need to be notified, letters of credit
would need to be opened, and any other counterparties would have
to be involved again.
 ""The trade and shipping are pretty hard hit by these
measures,"" said Herman de Meester, deputy secretary general with
the European Community Shipowners' Associations, representing
ship owners in the EU bloc and Norway.

 * Brazil resigned for now to real below 1.65/dlr level
 * ""Wait and see"" attitude before any new capital controls
 * Stance could change quickly if real appreciates further
(Adds market movement, graf 4)
 By Brian Winter
 SAO PAULO, April 1 (Reuters) - Brazil will continue to be
the land of the $6 Big Mac and the $65 filet mignon, as
government officials see no good short-term options to weaken
one of the world's most overvalued currencies.
 Government sources told Reuters that President Dilma
Rousseff will -- at least in the short term -- tolerate the
real's rise to a 31-month high rather than try to fight it with
major new capital controls, taxes or other measures.
 ""The attitude for now is to wait and see,"" said one of the
officials, speaking like others on condition of anonymity. ""We
don't have any good options.""
 The real strengthened on Friday after the official's
comments were published, firming 0.61 percent to about 1.62 per
dollar.
 The dilemma Rousseff faces illustrates how policymakers
throughout the emerging market world may be running out of easy
solutions to deal with their strong currencies. Brazil's robust
economy and double-digit interest rates have made it an
especially juicy target as investors from the developed world,
where rates are extremely low, seek high yields elsewhere.
 Rousseff's government had previously defended the real
 at the unofficial threshold of 1.65 per dollar,
implementing new intervention measures such as taxes on foreign
bond purchases when the currency threatened to strengthen
beyond that level.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Scenario piece on possible forex measures: [ID:nN14145427]
 Graphic on interest rates: http://r.reuters.com/rur78r
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Yet the real burst through that barrier this week. It is
now up more than 2.5 percent this year, and 40 percent since
2009.
 The real's rise hurts some local manufacturers, a major
Rousseff constituency. But her economic team has decided to
hold off for now on any major new intervention measures,
believing that a slightly stronger currency could help act as a
brake on rising inflation and ease the threat from higher
global oil prices, the officials said.
 Officials are also worried that any of the potential
capital controls still at their disposal would carry negative
side effects by curtailing productive investment from abroad.
 One official compared the measures still available to
choosing a stronger set of chemotherapy drugs to deal with
cancer. ""You have to be careful,"" the official said.
 Rousseff could shift strategy quickly and implement severe
new controls if the real continues to strengthen, the officials
warned. They also said the central bank would continue its
regular interventions in the currency market to limit the
real's rise as much as possible.
 OIL PRICES A BIG CONCERN
 The officials declined to specify what the new unofficial
threshold for the real is. But their comments amount to a
decision to retrench just above the 1.60-per-dollar level as
the torrent of speculative and long-term capital flowing into
Brazil shows no sign of abating soon.
 Recent measures aimed at curtailing the inflows have had
diminished results. Brazil on Tuesday raised a tax on foreign
borrowing for loans of up to 360 days, but the effect on the
foreign exchange market was practically nil. [ID:nN29248075]
 ""That was a disappointment,"" one official said.
 The strength of the real, which Goldman Sachs has called
the world's most overvalued major currency, is a product of
factors both beyond and within Brazil's control.
 Global trends such as the weak U.S. dollar and the
availability of cheap money in the developed world have caused
problems for many emerging economies. Yet Brazil's heavy
government spending and 11.75 percent benchmark interest rate
have made the situation worse.
 One of the triggers for this week's currency rally was a
report by the central bank, which stated that inflation would
likely rise to near the top of its target range this year.
Markets took that as a sign of weakness, betting that
authorities would have to let the real rise or resort to
interest rate increases in months ahead to control prices.
 That bet looks to be right, so far.
 Officials said they are particularly worried that continued
high global oil prices could eventually trickle down to
Brazilian consumers. State-run oil company Petrobras 
has so far not passed along the brunt of higher costs to the
gasoline pump, but that could change if prices rise further,
the officials said.
 Another possible factor in the government's thinking:
Brazilian industrial output posted an unexpected sharp rise in
February, according to new data published Friday, meaning that
the strong currency's effect on the sector may not be as
corrosive as previously believed. [ID:nN01126425]

995,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2011 10:56AM ET</span>","WRAPUP 2-Portugal pays heavily to borrow, S&P cuts Ireland"," * Portugal short-term borrowing costs hit 5.8 percent
 * S&P cuts Irish rating, Fitch may follow suit
 * Economists see even lower Irish growth
 * Bailout remains on for Portugal, Spain seen sheltered

(Adds ratings agency actions, details, quotes)
 By Andrei Khalip and Carmel Crimmins
 LISBON/DUBLIN, April 1 (Reuters) - A successful Portuguese
debt sale on Friday did little to cull expectations it will soon
join the euro zone bailout list, while Ireland's credit rating
was cut after bank stress tests revealed another black hole.
 Portugal sold 1.645 billion euros of short-dated bonds, but
had to offer an interest rate of 5.79 percent, lower than other
current market rates but 2.5 percentage points more than it paid
at auctions of similar bonds last year.
 The result means Lisbon is now having to pay a higher
interest rate to borrow money for the next 15 months than Spain
is paying to raise funds for 10 years -- a clear indication of
how much risk investors now attach to Portugal.
 Portugal's 10-year bond yields went on rising despite the
smooth auction, hitting 8.77 percent, up more than a percentage
point in the past week. Ireland's reached 10.1 percent, nearly
6.5 percentage points higher than benchmark German Bunds.
 Richard McGuire, a debt strategist at Rabobank, said that
while Friday's auction showed Lisbon could still tap the markets
if needed, the trend was not bleak.
 ""(Portugal) is fundamentally insolvent -- i.e. it is clearly
in a situation where debt will have to be issued to cover
servicing costs, thereby resulting in a snowballing of
liabilities,"" he said.
 Standard & Poor's stripped Ireland of its last 'A' rating
but the one notch cut and stable outlook was less severe than
feared and it gave the thumbs up to stress tests which on
Thursday showed its four troubled banks needed a further 24
billion euros to be properly capitalised.
 S&P, whose rubbishing of a previous ""final bill"" for
Ireland's banking sector sent the country's debt crisis into
overdrive last year, said the assumptions underlying the latest
round of tests were robust.
 But rival agency Fitch took the shine off S&P's modest
downgrade when it warned it could cut its BBB+ rating on the
back of weaker growth and a jump in the bank bailout costs.
 A Reuters poll of economists found a consensus forecast of
just 0.5 percent growth in Ireland this year, well below the
official forecast of 1.7 percent and weaker than the 0.9 percent
pencilled in by the European Commission and IMF.
 Underscoring the tenuous nature of Portugal's finances, the
statistics agency had to restate the 2010 budget deficit on
Thursday, increasing the shortfall to 8.6 percent of gross
domestic product from 7.3 percent.
 The adjustment was down to methodology and will not affect
2011 figures, but still undermines broader confidence.
 Financial markets are convinced Lisbon will have to ask the
European Union and International Monetary Fund for a bailout,
but Portuguese leaders are adamantly opposed. Credit ratings
agencies have already downgraded Portugal.
 Caretaker Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who
resigned last week after parliament rejected his latest spending
cuts, has made it a point of honour not to accept EU/IMF help
and is likely to hold that line until new elections.
 Portugal's president dissolved parliament on Thursday and
set June 5 as the date for the next polls, meaning the country
is effectively in limbo for two more months.
 While Portugal can probably go on funding itself for the
next eight weeks -- it has to refinance 4.3 billion euros ($6.1
billion) of debt in April and 4.9 billion in June -- the cost of
doing so is likely to go on being punitively high.
 
 SPAIN MAY ESCAPE
 The debt crisis in the euro zone has already consumed Greece
and Ireland and shows few signs of relenting.
 Greece, which agreed 110 billion euros of bilateral loans
with the EU and IMF last May, is making efforts to cut spending
and increase revenue to overhaul its economy, but questions
remain about whether it can get on top of its finances.
 The 24 billion euros extra bank bill for Ireland, which
received an 85 billion euro package of aid from the EU and IMF
in November, was in line with market expectations and, coupled
with the European Central Bank's decision to suspend collateral
requirements for loans from Ireland, gave the Irish banking
sector a lift on Friday.
 The European Commission said it believed the stress tests
had been ""extremely rigorous"" and that there should now be no
more surprises lurking for the financial markets.
 But Ireland still has accumulated bank liabilities of nearly
45 percent of GDP and will have total debts of well over 100
percent of GDP if forecasts from the stress tests are right.
 If the European Central Bank raises interest rates next week
as expected, the impact on growth and debts will be even
greater.
 Portugal finds itself in a similar conundrum. Its economy is
forecast to contract by around 1.0 percent this year, according
to the latest European Commission forecasts. As a result, the
debt-to-GDP ratio will climb without the debt increasing.
 Spain, though, continues to look as if it has done enough to
stave off the pressure from financial markets.
 While Spain shares many of the features of Ireland and
Portugal -- high deficit, high public sector debt, structural
banking issues -- it has bitten the bullet on making spending
cuts and retooling its economy.
 ""Resilience in the Spanish macroeconomic performance since
the summer of 2010, in spite of painful fiscal consolidation and
very elevated unemployment, is likely into the next few years,""
Deutsche Bank said in an economic report.
 ""This country should be able to deliver a positive, albeit
slow, growth rate consistent with a sustainable path for public
debt,"" it said.

 By Barani Krishnan and Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose to its highest level since June 2008, and shares
on other major markets rose too, as investors began the second
quarter with optimism, after an upbeat U.S. employment report.
 Shares on Wall Street [.N] jumped after the U.S.
government reported a second straight month of solid gains in
jobs and a slight drop in unemployment, which stood at 2-year
lows.
 Analysts said the job numbers signalled that recovery in
the world's largest economy remained firmly on track.
 The jobs data is ""very consistent with the view that the
recovery is gaining some momentum,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New
York. ""It's hard to argue with the case that we have further to
go in this bull market economic recovery cycle.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 88.97

of 12,391.29 for 2011 and the highest level since June 2008.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 10.25 points,
or 0.77 percent, at 1,336.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index

 The improving jobs picture was a short-term positive for a
stronger U.S. dollar also. The greenback added to early session
gains and was up 0.9 percent against a basket of major

.
 A total of 216,000 nonfarm U.S. jobs were added in March,
the government said, well above the 190,000 expected in a
Reuters poll.
 January and February employment figures were revised to
show 7,000 more jobs than previously reported, and the
unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 8.8 percent. For
details, see [ID:nNOAT00477]
 ENERGY COSTS RISING
 While the latest job statistics looked encouraging, there
was concern that rising energy and commodity prices could
squeeze investments in business expansion, threatening the
employment outlook.
 ""One has to wonder whether we'll see the pace of hiring
slow as a result,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist
at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.
 Oil prices rose 2.0 percent to hit 2-1/2 year highs on
Thursday. They extended the rally briefly on Friday, after the
release of the job numbers, before turning lower on
profit-taking. At 10:11 ET (1411 GMT), crude futures were down
0.1 percent at $106.62 a barrel in New York  and off 0.3
percent at $116.98 in London .
 U.S. copper's benchmark contract May  was down 1.8
percent at $4.2310 a lb.
 BOND YIELDS RISE
 U.S. Treasuries fell as the rise in stock prices indicated
higher risk appetite, but trimmed losses after New York Federal
Reserve Bank President William Dudley said the nation was still
""very far away"" from achieving the dual mandate of maximum
sustainable employment and price stability.
 Dudley's remarks, prepared in a statement, countered more
hawkish comments from other Fed officials, notably one
non-voting member of the Fed's policy committee.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes , down 8/32

 * Tactical move puts pressure on U.S. to speed up next move
 * Wooden letterbox marks latest stage in epic trade fight
(Updates with additional USTR comment)
 By Tim Hepher and Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 GENEVA/BRUSSELS, April 1 (Reuters) - The European Union
filed an appeal against an aircraft subsidies ruling on Friday
just hours after calling it a victory, a tactical move in a
transatlantic game of global trade chess.
 Europe's appeal came after the World Trade Organization
ruled Boeing had received at least $5.3 billion in subsidies
that were against the WTO rules, hailed as a ""crystal-clear""
win by the European Commission.
 Washington has also claimed victory in the verdict by
comparing it to recent WTO condemnation of what the United
States says are even larger European subsidies to Airbus.
 Together the cases represent the world's largest trade
dispute.
 The case against EU aid to Airbus -- lodged by the United
States -- is several months ahead of the case against U.S. aid
to Boeing, raising European fears that Airbus could eventually
have to stop receiving disputed aid months before its U.S.
rival. The EU's appeal was made quickly in order to close that
gap.
 Both sides have 30 days to appeal, but once one side
appeals, the other must decide whether to respond in five
days.
 ""The EU's victory in this case against Boeing remains very
clear for all to see. However, the EU has chosen to quickly
appeal technical elements of the ruling for legal strategic
reasons -- including to reduce what has been a growing time gap
between the two parallel aircraft disputes,"" said John Clancy,
EU trade spokesman.
 A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
accused the EU of dragging out the dispute instead of moving to
comply with a separate WTO ruling that found Airbus had
received some $20 billion in subsidies.
 ""We believe the panel's findings challenged by the EU are
correct and that the Appellate Body will affirm them. The
Europeans haven't gotten the message. Instead of prolonging the
dispute at the WTO, they should be figuring out how to comply
with the findings against them,"" spokeswoman Nefeterius
McPherson said.
 The United States says Thursday's decision found only $2.7
billion in subsidies for Boeing that it still has to remove
because it has already eliminated some of its support.
 To see what happens next over the $2 trillion plane market
and 100,000 affected jobs, all eyes are on a wooden letterbox.
 A modern trade war is waged with a combination of
electronic communications, light footwork and almost balletic
stagecraft on the shores of Lake Geneva, home to the 153-nation
WTO.
 To start the clock on possible sanctions or appeals,
delegates step across a path from the WTO's marbled
headquarters lined with murals and slip a note into an A4-sized
pigeon-hole.
 DIPLOMATIC DANCE
 Like most diplomatic dance steps in a city hosting more
than 20 international organizations, even the most apparently
trivial move, like the timing of Friday's EU appeal, is quickly
scanned for anything political.
 By narrowing the nine-month gap between the two competing
cases, the EU may reduce the vulnerable period during which the
nerve of member states could wobble once the WTO gives its
verdict on appeals in the case against Airbus next month.
 Washington has already said Airbus must rapidly repay or
restructure disputed European loans after that verdict.
 In the case the EU is appealing on Friday, the United
States could now respond with its own early appeal, or try to
slow proceedings down by calling for a WTO hearing to discuss
technical matters such as how to handle confidential data.
 The dispute over aircraft subsidies is the largest case
ever handled by the WTO, set up in 1995 to police global
trade.
 Rulings on the case run to 2,000 pages. If allowed to run
their course, the mutual subsidy complaints could trigger
sanctions and a possible trade war, but most analysts say that
point is years off and may be prevented through negotiation.
 ""The reality is that ... settlement of this dispute could
yet be years off,"" said aviation expert Howard Wheeldon, senior
strategist at BGC Partners in London.
 The case has kept dozens of lawyers, diplomats, lobbyists
and trade delegates active for six years, not only from the
United States and Europe but other countries indirectly
affected like Australia, China, Brazil, Canada, Japan and South
Korea.
 One source involved in the case estimated the total cost of
the proceedings so far at tens of millions of dollars, reaching
possibly $60 million for one side alone -- more than 1 percent
of the subsidies identified in the most recent finding.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - The dollar gained broadly on
Friday, rallying to its highest level in more than six months
against the yen as solid U.S. employment data further widened
yield differentials.
 U.S. employment recorded a second straight month of solid
gains in March and the jobless rate fell to a two-year low of
8.8 percent, marking a decisive shift in the labor market that
should help to underpin the economic recovery.
 Prior to the New York session, the dollar/yen blew past
its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2010.
The dollar last traded up 1.6 percent at 84.48, a high of more
than six months.
 Against the yen, the euro leaped to an 11-month high. It
last traded up 1.1 percent at 119.05.
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4102. Market
participants said options-related barriers around $1.4250 would
cap any upside in the single currency for the moment. A break
above that level would open the way to $1.4293, a peak hit in
November.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.7
percent at 76.379.
 While the European Central Bank will likely be the first
central bank to raise rates at its policy meeting next week,
Friday's payrolls report brings closer the day when the Federal
Reserve may raise benchmark interest rates.
 U.S. federal fund futures extended losses after the
payrolls data, with the January 2012 contract trading 6.5 ticks
lower at 99.605.
 ""We expect more (jobs) to be created the rest of the year.
It's definitely a short-term positive for the likes of
dollar/yen and we also got a move in the dollar versus the
euro,"" said David Mann, regional head of research for the
Americas at Standard Chartered in New York.
 The Bank of Japan is widely expected to lag behind the Fed
and the European Central Bank in raising interest rates,
especially in the wake of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
 An improving U.S. economy bolsters the argument for tighter
monetary policy and should further widen dollar/yen yield
differentials.
 That would enhance the yen's appeal as a funding currency
of choice amongst investors like hedge funds and model funds,
which are increasingly looking to sell the yen and buy
high-yielding currencies, called carry trades.
 Boris Schlossberg, director of research at GFT Forex in New
York, said the carry trade has ""come back with a vengeance"" and
the ""yen could assume its former status as the funding currency
for the carry trade, weakening progressively as rates in the
rest of the G-20 begin to rise.""
 A series of hawkish comments by Fed officials recently has
helped drive U.S. Treasury yields higher this week and caused
the dollar's yield advantage over the yen to widen.
 That spread widened further on Friday, with two-year
Treasury yields, the most responsive to Fed policy, hitting
their highest levels since May 2010.
 While markets are pricing in at least three ECB rate hikes
this year, investors are wary that a sustained rise in rates
could push up funding costs for peripheral euro zone countries
and add to their debt woes.

 By Angus MacSwan
 BENGHAZI, Libya, April 1 (Reuters) - The rebel movement in
eastern Libya is discussing plans to exempt its oil exports from
sanctions and has also raised the issue with a U.N. envoy, a top
rebel financial official said on Friday.
 Ali Tarhouni, the rebel official in charge of economic,
financial and oil matters, said Qatar would provide fuel,
medicine, food and other humanitarian needs to rebels as part of
a deal to market oil from the rebel-held east of the country.
 Much of Libyan oil production comes from fields in the east
of Libya, an area controlled by rebels seeking to oust Muammar
Gaddafi. But output has dwindled because shipments have halted,
and there is limited storage and refining capacity.
 U.N. diplomats in New York said on Monday that U.N.
sanctions on Libya did not bar rebels from exporting oil as long
as they bypass firms linked to Gaddafi.
 ""Our demands are simple and clear. Our top priority is
lifting the sanctions that stop us exporting our oil,"" Tarhouni
told a news conference, adding the issue of lifting sanctions
had been raised with a visiting U.N. envoy, Abdelilah al-Khatib.
 He said that Khatib, who was in the rebel-held stronghold of
Benghazi, had responded that he would convey the rebel request
to the United Nations.
 Speaking earlier in the day, Tarhouni said: ""What we want is
an exemption from the sanctions. This is our main problem. It is
very hard for us, it is an obstacle.""
 He said rebels were discussing an exemption with what he
described as ""friends"" in the international community, but did
not give details.
 Qatar recognised Libyan rebels on Monday, a day after rebels
said the Gulf Arab state had agreed to market crude oil produced
from east Libyan fields no longer under the control of Gaddafi.

 
 SUPPLY LINES
 Providing further details of that deal, Tarhouni said: ""The
Qataris agreed they would market crude oil for us, and we would
put the money in an escrow account. We will receive what we need
in fuel, medicine, food and humanitarian needs from them.""
 Tarhouni said rebels had set up a ""quasi-ministry of oil""
and that oil staff were now working under that body or for the
east-based Arabian Gulf Oil Company (Agoco), which has said it
has cut ties with its parent, state-owned National Oil Corp.
 Rebels continue to provide basic domestic fuel needs,
although towards the frontline of fighting during a rapid
advance by rebel forces earlier this week supply lines were
stretched and some fuel stations ran out of petrol.
 Rebels had controlled all the oil terminals in the east
briefly this week but were ejected after Gaddafi's forces
bombarded their positions and chased them back east.
 Gaddafi's forces now control Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, while
Brega is now on the frontline and rebels control Zueitina and
Tobruk further east.
 Asked how the loss of Ras Lanuf or Brega could affect the
Qatari pact, Tarhouni said: ""The deal has nothing to do with
Brega and Ras Lanuf. We are talking about oil production in the
southeast. The oil that flows from there is stored in liberated
areas,"" adding that the oil would be exported from Tobruk.
 ""The only delay is finding vessels that will carry the oil.
That is the only obstacle we have,"" he said.
 Officials of Agoco, the main producer based in the east,
have said production was running about a quarter of the more
than 400,000 barrels per day the company produces under normal
conditions.
 U.N. Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 slapped
sanctions on Gaddafi, his family and inner circle, the National
Oil Corp, the central bank and other firms linked to Gaddafi.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose and the
U.S. dollar extended gains on Friday after an upbeat U.S.
employment report signaled the recovery in the world's largest
economy remained firmly on track.
 U.S. stock index futures  pointed to a
higher open after the report, while European equities <.FTEU3>
extended early gains, rising 1.1 percent.
 The improving jobs picture was a short-term positive for a
stronger dollar. The greenback added to early session gains and
was up 0.7 percent against a basket of major currencies <.DXY>
and up 0.5 percent versus the euro .
 A total of 216,000 nonfarm U.S. jobs were added in March,
the government said, well above the 190,000 expected in a
Reuters poll.
 January and February employment figures were revised to
show 7,000 more jobs than previously reported, and the
unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 8.8 percent. For
details, see [ID:nNOAT00477]
 The data is ""very consistent with the view that the
recovery is gaining some momentum,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New
York. ""It's hard to argue with the case that we have further to
go in this bull market economic recovery cycle.""
 Crude oil prices extended slight gains on the stronger jobs
picture. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, May crude 
rose 50 cents to $107.22 a barrel
 ""The numbers are obviously good, and one can hope that we
will continue to see the market rise in continuing months,""
said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic
Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.
 Baumohl cautioned that rising energy prices could threaten
the employment outlook by putting a squeeze on household
spending and business investment.
 ""One has to wonder whether we'll see the pace of hiring
slow as a result,"" Baumohl said.
 U.S. Treasuries extended losses after the data, as
investors' hunt for risk picked up pace, while safe-haven gold
 also fell to a session low.
 ""Bonds weakened on the news because the payrolls number was
a little bit stronger than expected,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief
financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""If the economy has lifted off and the labor market
continues to produce jobs, that can only mean one thing ...
we're getting closer to the day when the Fed starts to
normalize interest rates,"" Rupkey said, referring to the U.S.
central bank.
 ""And if the Fed is going to do that, that means 10-year
yields under 3.5 percent don't have a lot of value.""

 * Government official: proposals looks ""cosmetic""
 * Investors: implementation will be key
 
 By Guy Faulconbridge
MOSCOW, April 1 (Reuters) - If Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev wants to convince the world he has dared to split with
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, he may have to show more mettle.
 Medvedev's call for oil tsar Igor Sechin and other Putin
allies to relinquish their posts as board chairmen of state
companies has stoked speculation he may be challenging his
mentor ahead of the March 2012 presidential election.
 It sent a strong signal, but Medvedev has floated vaguer
versions of the same idea since he was steered into the top job
by Putin in 2008, so the real test is how far he succeeds in
whittling down their influence in practice.
 Many investors and analysts believe Russia's head of state
and its most powerful man are enacting an elaborate charade to
give the impression of competition in a tightly controlled
political system.
 ""I'm still of the view that the gap between Putin and
Medvedev is much smaller than a lot of people think. The success
of both of them depends on stability,"" said Roland Nash, chief
investment strategist at Verno Capital in Moscow.
 ""There is good reason to portray a sense of conflict to
enable them to execute their agenda. I don't believe we are
seeing some massive split in the duopoly. But the evidence may
be accumulating against me.""
 Medvedev's demand for the removal of ministers from state
company boards came 10 days after he chastised Putin, indirectly
but clearly, for comparing the U.N. resolution authorising
Western airstrikes in Libya to ""medieval calls for crusades"".
 Putin responded to the Libya criticism by saying calmly
there was no division between him and Medvedev on the issue. But
if Medvedev challenges the powerful clans which support Putin,
he could provoke a backlash.
 The stakes of taking on Deputy Prime Minister Sechin, the
informal leader of a group of powerful former security service
officers and conservatives around Putin, are huge.
 Russia is the world's largest commodity producer and Sechin
oversees energy and industrial policy.
 He has been board chairman at state-controlled Rosneft,
Russia's biggest oil company, since 2006, and has built it into
a global energy major as well as organising the now blocked $16
billion share swap between BP and Rosneft.
 
 COSMETIC OR REAL?
 Ejecting officials such as Sechin and Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin from the boardrooms of Russia's national champions
by mid-year certainly appears like a bid to curb the economic
clout of Putin's allies.
 But even if Sechin is removed from his unpaid post at
Rosneft, he may continue to wield influence.
 One senior government official told Reuters Medvedev's
proposal would be taken up but would have little impact.
 ""Since we have been told to, we will have to go,"" said the
source, who sits on the boards of some state-controlled
companies. ""But this measure is cosmetic because the government
will still issue key directives.""
 So why do it and why do it now?
 Some suspect the Kremlin's political managers are trying to
toughen Medvedev's image ahead of the election to dispel fears
of stagnation.
 ""This has been done just to attract people's attention to
the elections, to create a whirlpool,"" said a source in the
Russian oil industry. ""There is nothing really behind this
initiative but PR.""
 Putin is viewed as Russia's most powerful man despite
stepping down as president in 2008 after serving the maximum two
consecutive terms allowed in the constitution.
 They have said they will decide together which one of them
will run for president in 2012.
 Medvedev's announcement on shaking up boardrooms was made in
a sharply critical speech which amounted to a dissection of the
growth of the state's role in the economy during Putin's
2000-2008 presidency.
 The Kremlin chief said endemic graft was driving capital
flight and called on Gazprom and pipeline monopoly Transneft to
slash costs, which he said were higher than competitors because
of corruption.
 ""The grip of corruption is not weakening: it is holding the
economy by the neck,"" Medvedev said. ""The result is obvious:
money is fleeing.""
 Investors said that, if successful, Medvedev's plans could
result in some of the vast state-controlled companies which
dominate the oil, gas and financial sectors of Russia's $1.5
trillion economy focusing on profits rather than politics.
 ""This is a very credible measure and if achieved it would be
fantastic but that is the question that the market may be
cynical about,"" said Jochen Wermuth, managing partner of Wermuth
Asset Management which has $300 million under management.
 ""I do not know whether Putin and Medvedev are laughing at
everyone for thinking they are separating,"" he said. ""Their gut
instincts do seem to be different.""

 (Corrects figure for 2010 Porgtuguese budget deficit in
paragraph 4)
 By Andrei Khalip and Carmel Crimmins
 LISBON/DUBLIN, April 1 (Reuters) - Portugal's successful
debt sale on Friday did little to ease speculation it will soon
join the euro zone bailout list, while investors repriced Irish
assets after absorbing the results of bank stress tests.
 Portugal sold 1.645 billion euros of short-dated bonds, but
had to offer an interest rate of 5.79 percent to attract buyers.
That was lower than other current market rates but 2.5
percentage points more than it paid at auctions of similar bonds
last year.
 The result means Lisbon is now having to pay a higher
interest rate to borrow money for the next 15 months than Spain
is paying to raise funds for 10 years -- a clear indication of
how much risk investors now attach to Portugal.
 Underscoring the tenuous nature of the government's
finances, the statistics agency had to restate the 2010 budget
deficit on Thursday, increasing the shortfall to 8.6 percent of
gross domestic product from 7.3 percent.
 The adjustment was down to methodology and will not affect
2011 figures, but still undermines broader confidence.
 Financial markets are convinced Lisbon will have to ask the
European Union and International Monetary Fund for a bailout,
but Portuguese leaders are adamantly opposed. Credit ratings
agencies have already downgraded Portugal.
 Caretaker Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who
resigned last week after parliament rejected his latest plans
for cutting spending, has made it a point of honour not to
accept EU/IMF help and is likely to hold that line until new
elections.
 Portugal's president dissolved parliament on Thursday and
set June 5 as the date for the next polls, meaning the country
is effectively in limbo for two more months. The caretaker
government does not have the power to request a bailout.
 While Portugal can probably go on funding itself for the
next eight weeks -- it has to refinance 4.3 billion euros ($6.1
billion) of debt in April and 4.9 billion in June -- the cost of
doing so is likely to go on being punitively high.
 Richard McGuire, a debt strategist at Rabobank, said that
while Friday's auction showed the government could still tap the
markets if needed, the long-term trend was not encouraging.
 ""This does not, though, obviate the fact that (Portugal) is
fundamentally insolvent -- i.e. it is clearly in a situation
where debt will have to be issued to cover servicing costs,
thereby resulting in a snowballing of liabilities.""
 
 IRELAND WAKES UP TO BIG BANK BILLS
 The debt crisis in the euro zone has already consumed Greece
and Ireland and shows few signs of relenting, despite the fact
that international investor attention has shifted to events in
Japan and the United States and to the unrest in North Africa.
 Greece, which agreed 110 billion euros of bilateral loans
with the EU and IMF last May, is making efforts to cut spending
and increase revenue to overhaul its economy, but questions
remain about whether it can get on top of its finances.
 With debt approaching 150 percent of GDP this year,
economists say the burden is bordering on unsustainable. That
makes a debt restructuring more likely unless Athens can
maintain a high primary surplus and generate more than 50
billion euros of income from privatisations.
 In Ireland, which received an 85 billion euro package of aid
from the EU and IMF in November, stress tests on Thursday showed
that the four troubled banks examined needed a further 24
billion euros to be properly capitalised.
 That was in line with market expectations and, coupled with
the European Central Bank's decision to suspend collateral
requirements for loans from Ireland, gave the Irish banking
sector a minor lift on Friday.
 The European Commission said it believed the stress tests
had been ""extremely rigorous"" and that there should now be no
more surprises lurking for the financial markets.
 Some analysts seemed to share that view, with Barclays
Capital saying in a research note that there was reason to be
reassured, although the restructuring, in its view, should
include some bank bondholders taking on losses.
 ""The government had already indicated that they would seek
some bail-in by bondholders in the spirit of burden-sharing,""
Barclays said. ""As we have indicated... we consider burden
sharing as a sine qua non for a successful fiscal consolidation
plan and hence for sovereign solvency.""
 But Ireland still has accumulated bank liabilities of nearly
45 percent of GDP and will have total debts of well over 100
percent of GDP if forecasts from the stress tests are right.
 With low growth prospects this year and unemployment of more
than 13 percent, Ireland is in a race to get its economy back in
gear before its debts become too much of a burden. If the
European Central Bank raises interest rates this month as
expected, the impact on growth and debts will be even greater.
 Portugal finds itself in a similar conundrum. It's economy
is forecast to contract by around 1.0 percent this year,
according to the lastest European Commission forecasts, and
unemployment is 11 percent and rising. Under those conditions,
the debt-to-GDP ratio will climb without the debt increasing.
 Spain, though, continues to look as if it has done enough to
stave off the pressure from financial markets, despite its 10
year bond yields standing at 5.03 percent, with the spread over
German Bunds at more than 160 basis points.
 While Spain shares many of the features of Ireland and
Portugal -- high deficit, high public sector debt, structural
banking issues -- it has bitten the bullet on making spending
cuts and retooling its economy.
 ""Resilience in the Spanish macroeconomic performance since
the summer of 2010, in spite of painful fiscal consolidation and
very elevated unemployment, is likely into the next few years,""
Deutsche Bank said in an economic report.
 ""This country should be able to deliver a positive, albeit
slow, growth rate consistent with a sustainable path for public
debt,"" it said, pointing out that the sovereign interest rate
spread over Bunds had stabilised over the past three months.

 * Also calls for physical markets data, position limits
 
 By Sybille de La Hamaide
 PARIS, April 1 (Reuters) - France gained a new ally in its
drive to better regulate commodities markets during its G20
presidency when on Friday the French financial markets lobby
said regulation should start with information.
 Paris Europlace, a private and public body representing
major players in the financial markets, said in a report that
transparency on both the physical and financial markets was the
starting point to limit manipulative trades and speculation.
 It put forward eight proposals including the creation of a
global trade repository, which would register all financial
transactions based on agricultural assets.
 ""Information seems to be a prerequisite. To have a more
complete and real-time outlook of all the data is crucial,""
Pierre Moraillon, managing director at Credit Agricole Corporate
and Investment Banking, who chaired the report, told reporters.
 France has put the regulation of commodities markets, mainly
agricultural products, at the top of its agenda for heading the
Group of 20 economies. It blames speculation in these markets
for exacerbating a surge in prices of food staples last year.
 Farm minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters earlier this month
that, although it was close to getting a green light on plans to
improve transparency on agricultural data, coordination on
export policies and emergency stocks, a deal regarding the
financial markets would be harder to reach.
 Most key observers agree market transparency and data will
be at the top of the G20 agriculture conclusions.
 
 TRADE REPOSITORY
 In line with France's proposals, Paris Europlace said the
market also needed better information on physical markets,
something it says would tame volatility. It said the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) could manage
such information.
 ""Today stocks, production, exchanges, even data provided by
big states are distorted, arrive six months or one year later or
are false, so I would say it is the prerequisite and as
important and indispensable as a repository,"" Moraillon said.
 Paris Europlace, which advocates creating a European
regulator of agricultural markets, said there was little proof
of the link between speculation and volatility.
 ""But there are exceptions. Brutal entrance and pullout of
financial actors in derivative markets can create abnormal
situations,"" Moraillon said.
 Setting position limits on derivatives, as long as they do
not threaten market liquidity, could be a way to head off brutal
moves and market squeezes, the report said.
 These limits would differ between types of operators --
those players who do purely financial transactions on an
opportunistic basis and those who need to cover physical needs.
 The lobby said governments should encourage food storage
both in developed countries and to meet potential humantarian
needs in developing countries but stressed that these should be
managed by private firms.

 * Fed sounding more hawkish
 * Investors look to life with tighter policy
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - The new quarter is bringing with
it a new danger for investors -- the withdrawal of the easy
money that saw them through the financial crisis.
 The European Central Bank is widely expected to raise
interest rates on Thursday, fearful that above-target inflation
will become embedded.
 At the same time, members of the U.S. Federal Reserve have
been making hawkish sounds about what will happen when its
pump-priming quantitative easing programme closes in June. They
meet later in the month.
 The Bank of England, meanwhile, should keep rates on hold
at its meeting on Thursday, but the panel's tightening advocates
are getting noisier.
 What is behind it all, of course, is the fact that the
global economy, including its lagging western bits, is doing
quite well and central banks want to make unusually
accommodative policy just that -- unusual.
 ""When things get better, ironically, this is the time to
worry as authorities could withdraw support and subsequently
impact on the corresponding risk markets,"" London & Capital told
its clients.
 There are already signs that the prospect of higher interest
rates is weighing on the bond market, with the ECB's likely move
particularly hard on the euro zone's embattled peripheral debt
in Greece, Portugal and Ireland.
 Overall, March was a month of extraordinary risks for
investors -- from Japan's triple disasters to civil war in
oil-producer Libya -- yet there was no flight to the supposed
safety of bonds.
 Reuters asset allocation polls for the month found that
global investors actually cut overall bond allocations as well
as generally walking away from government, investment grade and
high-yield fixed income.
 Investment bank Citi's government bond returns data,
meanwhile, shows overall losses for March and the year as a
whole. In local currency terms, its World Government Bond Index
lost 0.14 percent in the month and 0.65 percent for the
year-to-date.
 It is not all because of interest rate expectations, but it
is hard to imagine this pressure will dissipate in the weeks
ahead as tightening approaches.

 GOOD AND BAD
 The story for equities -- which are barrelling along again
after cooling for much of March -- is more complex.
 Typically, the beginning of a tightening cycle is often good
for stocks because, as Klaus Wiener, head of research at
Generali Investments puts it, investors see the moves as a vote
of confidence in the economy.
 The first hikes are also generally meaningful only as a
message rather than having a fundamental impact. The ECB, for
example, may raise rates from 1 percent to just 1.25 percent --
which would still be a negative real-term rate given inflation
is running at 2.6 percent.
 The big impact comes later, when the tightening cycle starts
to bite on the economy and the yield curve flattens, essentially
making short-term borrowing expensive.
 Wiener reckons that is a long way off, but does add that
there is a different wrinkle at the moment -- easy monetary
policy in a number of places has included quantitative easing,
pumping money into markets by buying bonds.
 Such a flood of money has been a major driver in the stock
market rally that began in summer last year and has lifted the
MSCI all-country world stock index by 30 percent or more.
 ""If they stopped adding liquidity, that would hurt a bit,""
he said.
 Different rate expectations, meanwhile, have a profound
effect on currencies. The euro and dollar have already
strengthened while Japan's yen has weakened.
 The Bank of Japan on Thursday is expected to say it has left
rates on hold, but additional monetary easing cannot be ruled
out given the economic damage from the earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear breakdown.
 
 IT'S THE ECOOMY
 What is allowing the other major central banks to start
thinking about or actually withdrawing their hugely
accommodative policies is the growing belief that the world
economy is not only on the mend but growing sustainably.
 The banks have to balance the danger of allowing growth to
fire up inflation against tightening too soon and throwing the
baby out with the bathwater.
 This makes investors even more keen than usual to get
evidence about how well various economies are faring.
 March global services PMIs will take the temperature during
the coming week.
 And the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development will put out its latest economic outlook on Tuesday,
a taster ahead of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank
reports that accompany their spring meeting the following week.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Friday to a
10-month low against the euro and below its 200-day moving
average versus the dollar, with the greenback likely to push
higher if a key U.S. jobs report beats expectations.
 Speculation grew for a strong reading of non-farm payrolls
at 1230 GMT, which would reinforce perceptions an improving U.S.
economy would bolster the argument for tighter monetary policy
and further widen dollar/yen yield differentials.
 That would enhance the yen's appeal as a funding currency of
choice amongst investors like hedge funds and model funds, which
are increasingly looking to sell the yen and buy high-yielding
currencies. These investors are also going long on the
dollar/yen pair ahead of the U.S. jobs numbers.
 Analysts are forecasting the U.S. economy will add 190,000
jobs in March. The data comes a day after hawkish comments from
a U.S. Federal Reserve official gave traders more reason to
think the Fed will raise rates before the Bank of Japan.
 The BOJ is widely expected to lag behind the Fed and the
European Central Bank in raising interest rates, especially in
the wake of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated
Japan's northeast.
 ""A strong payrolls number would be reflected in the
dollar/yen and it could rise to 84.50 in the short term,"" said
Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York
Mellon. ""We expect to see prolonged yen weakness due to loose
monetary and fiscal policy in Japan.""
 The dollar was up 0.6 percent at 83.65 yen. It touched a
six-week high of 83.748 yen on trading platform EBS earlier, and
the next major peak on daily charts is its mid-February high of
83.98 yen. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.3
percent at 76.115.
 The dollar rose above its 200-day moving average against the
yen at 83.60 yen for the first time since June, suggesting
upside potential for the greenback.
 DOLLAR HIGHER ON HAWKISH COMMENTS
 The dollar was supported after the Wall Street Journal
reported that Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Narayana
Kocherlakota signaled the Fed could raise interest rates by 75
basis points by the end of the year.
 A series of hawkish comments by Fed officials recently has
helped drive U.S. Treasury yields higher this week and caused
the dollar's yield advantage over the yen to widen. President of
the New York Fed, William Dudley, and Dallas Fed chief Richard
Fisher were due to speak later on Friday.
 Analysts said improving risk appetite was drawing more
investors towards yen-funded carry trades. The yen fell broadly
on the crosses, hitting an 11-month low against the Australian
dollar and its lowest in more than 10 months against the euro.
 The single European currency rose as high as 118.675 yen on
trading platform EBS, the euro's highest against the yen since
mid-May 2010. The euro last stood at 118.35 yen, up 0.6 percent
on the day.
 The euro was slightly lower against the dollar at $1.4157,
barely reacting to an extraordinary issue of 2012 bonds by
Portugal. Talk of sovereign demand at $1.4140-50 and at
$1.4125-30 put a base under the single currency.
 Market participants said options-related barriers around
$1.4250 would cap any upside in the single currency for the
moment. A break above that level would open the way to $1.4293,
a peak hit in November.
 Portugal sold 1.645 billion euros of one-year debt at a high
price after yields soared this week on the back of political
uncertainty and rising expectations the country will need
financial aid.
 ""The euro has been incredibly resilient to the sovereign
debt woes,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe
Generale.
 The euro's resilience is partly due to expectations the ECB
will raise rates next week. Markets are pricing in at least
three rate hikes this year. But investors are wary that a
sustained rise in rates could push up funding costs for
peripheral euro zone countries and add to their debt woes.
 ""So the ECB's path towards normalising rates will depend
upon the reaction from the bond markets,"" added Juckes.

 By Chizu Nomiyama and Chisa Fujioka	
 TOKYO, April 1 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
said on Friday he was ready for a long fight to bring a
quake-hit nuclear plant under control but was convinced Japan
would overcome the world's worst nuclear crisis since the
Chernobyl disaster in 1986.	
 ""I am prepared for a long-term battle over the
Fukushima nuclear plant and to win this battle,"" he said in a
nationally broadcast news conference as the country marked three
weeks
since a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered the crisis.
[ID:nTFD006725]	
 ""We cannot say that the plant has been sufficiently
stabilised. But we are preparing for all kinds of situations and
I am convinced that the plant can be stabilised,"" Kan said,
promising a quake relief budget by the end of April.	
 As Tokyo Electric Power Co tries to regain control
of its stricken nuclear plant in the face of mounting public
criticism and a huge potential compensation bill, the government
was reportedly moving to take control of the utility.
[ID:nnL3E7EV46V]	
 Kan said the government had to ""responsibly""
support TEPCO as it faced obligations to compensate for the
accident. But he said he wanted the firm to continue to ""work
hard as a private company"".	
 The utility may have to deal with compensation claims
topping $130 billion, according to one U.S. investment bank.	
 In the devastated northeast, many Japanese still see only
the splintered remains of their homes and lives after a 9.0
magnitude earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that left more than
28,000 people dead or missing and damaged six nuclear
reactors.	
 
 Japan's Nuclear and Industry safety Agency (NISA) says
radiation may be continuously flowing out into the sea.	
 Radiation 4,000 times the legal limit has been detected in
seawater near the plant as contaminated water used to cool down
reactor rods leaks into the ocean, and high levels of radiation
outside a 20 km (12 mile) exclusion zone have put pressure on
Japan to widen the restricted area.	
 ""They are throwing water on what they can't see and hoping
that they don't get more radiation out. They are flying blind,
partially, at least,"" said Ed Lyman, senior scientist with the
Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S. nuclear safety watchdog
group.	
 
 SHATTERED LIVES	
 More than 172,400 people were still living in shelters
around northeast Japan. Many devastated areas looked like
rubbish-strewn junk yards, with cars lodged in the side of
toppled buildings and boats still high and dry on roads.	
 More than 70,000 have been evacuated from the exclusion ring
and another 136,000 who live in a 10-km (6-mile) zone beyond
that have been encouraged to leave or to stay indoors.	
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the evacuation of
people from near the damaged Fukushima Daiichi complex, 240 km
(150 miles) north of Tokyo, would be a long-term operation.	
 Nuclear experts say it could take years, possibly decades,
to make the area around the plant safe.	
 With thousands still missing and many areas off-limits to
rescuers due to the high levels of radiation, Japanese and U.S.
forces will soon begin a joint search for bodies.	
 The recovery of the bodies of up to 1,000 people killed by
the tsunami has been delayed by fears that they are
contaminated, police told Kyodo news.	
 The damage bill may top $300 billion, making it the world's
costliest natural disaster and raising concerns about the
world's third-biggest economy.	
 Japanese manufacturing activity slumped to a two-year low in
March and posted the sharpest monthly fall on record as the
quake and tsunami hit supply chains and output. [ID:nLHE7EO00C] 
 Japan's government may need to spend over 10 trillion yen
($120 billion) in emergency budgets for disaster relief and
reconstruction, the country's deputy finance minister, Mitsuru
Sakurai, signalled on Thursday. [ID:nL3E7EV0H6] 
 
 EMERGENCY NUCLEAR WORKERS RECRUITED	
 Nuclear workers have been offered up to 400,000 yen ($5,000)
per day to work in risky high-radiation conditions inside
reactors at the Fukushima plant, according to Japanese media.	
 TEPCO says it was considering using ""jumpers"", or workers
who rush into highly radioactive reactors for quick jobs, such
as installing water pumps, then ""jump"" out to avoid prolonged
exposure to radiation. The practice was common in the United
States in the 1970s and early 80s.	
 France is a global leader in the nuclear industry and Paris
has flown in experts from state-owned nuclear reactor maker
Areva  to work with Japanese engineers.	
 Areva has also shipped 11,000 hazmat suits and thousands of
protective breathing masks to be used in and around the nuclear
plants. 
 The United States and Germany are sending robots to work in
the highly radioactive parts of the reactors. Kyodo said around
140 U.S. military radiation safety experts would arrive.	
 U.S. nuclear workers were also being recruited to join the
recovery teams at Fukushima and will begin flying in on Sunday.
[ID:nnN31284409]	
 ""These are not 'jumpers' rushing into a room. TEPCO is
bringing in robots to help limit human exposure to high levels
of radiation,"" said Joe Melanson, a recruiter at specialist
nuclear industry staffing firm Bartlett Nuclear in Plymouth,
Massachusetts.	
 Japan's NISA has warned TEPCO to ensure the health of
workers after it was reported the company did not have enough
radiation dosemeters.	
 The Japanese disaster has revived the debate over the safety
and benefits of atomic power. In Switzerland a parcel bomb
exploded at the office of the national nuclear lobby, injuring
two employees. It was not known who sent it.	
France -- the most nuclear-dependent country in
the world -- has called for new global nuclear rules and
proposed a global conference in France. 
 Illustrating the terrible, surreal times through which Japan
is living, one newborn baby's first medical appointment was not
with a paediatrician but a Geiger counter. 
 ""I am so scared about radiation,"" Misato Nagashima said as
she took her baby Rio, born four days after the earthquake and
disaster, for a screening at a city in Fukushima prefecture. 
 Food and milk shipments from the region have been stopped,
devastating the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen. Various
countries have banned food imports from the area.	
 But life in Tokyo, Japan's capital of 13 million people, was
slowly returning to normal after the early days of the disaster
when train services were patchy, workers stayed home and
groceries like bread, milk, toilet paper and diapers were rare.	
 Yet Tokyo residents still worry about the spread of
radiation and another big quake.	
 ""I only go as far from home as I can walk back and I take
emergency gear with me,"" said Noriko Ariura, rummaging in a bag
holding a radio, flashlight, bottled water and medicine.

 * Wooden letterbox marks latest stage in epic trade fight
(Recasts, adds details, background)
 By Tim Hepher and Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 GENEVA/BRUSSELS, April 1 (Reuters) - The European Union
filed an appeal against an aircraft subsidies ruling on Friday
just hours after calling it a victory, a tactical move in a
transatlantic game of global trade chess.
 Europe's appeal came after the World Trade Organization
ruled Boeing had received at least $5.3 billion in subsidies
that were against the WTO rules, hailed as a ""crystal-clear"" win
by the European Commission.
 Washington has also claimed victory in the verdict by
comparing it to recent WTO condemnation of what the U.S. says
are even larger European sudsidies to Airbus.
 Together the cases represent the world's largest trade
dispute.
 The case against EU aid to Airbus -- lodged by the United
States -- is several months ahead in the WTO's appeals process,
raising European fears that Airbus could eventually have to stop
receiving disputed aid months before its U.S. rival.
 Appeals by both sides are common in the WTO system, but
players often wait until the last available opportunity to do
so. Sources familiar with the matter said the EU's appeal the
latest was made quickly in order to close that gap.
 Both sides have 30 days to appeal, but once one side
appeals, the other must decide whether to respond in 5 days.
 ""It is pure tactics,"" said a source close to the case.
 To see what happens next over the $2 trillion plane market
and 100,000 affected jobs, all eyes are on a wooden letterbox.
 A modern trade war is waged with a combination of electronic
communications, light footwork and almost balletic stagecraft on
the shores of Lake Geneva, home to the 153-nation WTO.
 To start the clock on possible sanctions or appeals,
delegates step across a path from the WTO's marbled headquarters
lined with murals and slip a note into an A4-sized pigeon-hole.
 
 DIPLOMATIC DANCE
 Like most diplomatic dance steps in a city hosting over 20
international organizations, even the most apparently trivial
move, like the timing of Friday's EU appeal, is quickly scanned
for anything political.
 By narrowing the nine-month gap between the two competing
cases, the EU may reduce the vulnerable period during which the
nerve of member states could wobble once the WTO gives its
verdict on appeals in the case against Airbus next month.
 Washington has already said Airbus must rapidly repay or
restructure disputed European loans after that verdict.
 In the case the EU is appealing on Friday, the United States
could now respond with its own early appeal, or try to slow
proceedings down by calling for a WTO hearing to discuss
technical matters such as how to handle confidential data.
 The dispute over aircraft subsidies is the largest case ever
handled by the WTO, set up in 1995 to police global trade.
 Rulings on the case run to 2,000 pages. If allowed to run
their course, the mutual subsidy complaints could trigger
sanctions and a possible trade war, but most analysts say that
point is years off and may be prevented through negotiation.
 ""The reality is that ... settlement of this dispute could
yet be years off,"" said aviation expert Howard Wheeldon, senior
strategist at BGC Partners in London.
 The case has kept dozens of lawyers, diplomats, lobbyists
and trade delegates active for six years, not only from the
United States and Europe but other countries indirectly affected
like Australia, China, Brazil, Canada, Japan and Korea. 
 One source involved in the case estimated the total cost of
the proceedings so far at tens of millions of dollars, reaching
possibly $60 million for just one side alone -- more than one
percent of the subsidies identified in the most recent finding.

 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - World stocks rose and the dollar
strengthened on the opening day of the second quarter, ahead of
U.S. jobs data expected to show that a recovery in the world's
largest economy remains firmly on track.
 Concerns over euro zone debt, Japan's nuclear crisis and
conflicts in the Middle East could all nix the rally, however,
while a bullish jobs reading may stoke inflation fears and
embolden central bank hawks looking to raise interest rates more
quickly.
 U.S. stock futures point to a higher open on Wall Street,
with the Dow Jones industrial average, Standard & Poor's 500
and Nasdaq composite seen up 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent.
 On the flip-side, U.S. Treasuries slipped ahead of the jobs
data as investors looked to take on more risk and became more
wary of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.
 In Europe, equities had eaked out a small gain in the
previous quarter and set about extending that run in early
Friday trade. By 1025 GMT, the index was up 0.6 percent, just
off its intraday high.
 Traders said all eyes were on the release of U.S. non-farm
payrolls data at 1230 GMT, which is expected to show 190,000
people were hired in March, fuelling optimism about the
sustainability of growth in the world's largest economy.
 A positive reading ""is set to boost risk appetite as the
global recovery begins to gather momentum, said Jonathan
Sudaria, night dealer at Capital Spreads, although it could be a
""double-edged sword"", added Jean-Yves Dumont, head of asset
allocation strategy and funds at Dexia Asset Management.
 ""Stronger-than-expected data will embolden the Fed's hawks,""
Dumont warned, after a senior U.S. Federal Reserve official
suggested, in a Wall Street Journal report, the Fed could raise
interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point by the
end of the year.
 Among the top movers were Irish banking shares, a day after
Dublin released details of stress tests showing its banks needed
an extra 24 billion euros, in line with expectations but pushing
the total bailout cost to $100 billion.
 That news had caused a late sell-off in European stocks on
Thursday, although buyers piled back in on Friday, and by 1025
GMT, the STOXX Europe 600 Banks was up 0.9 percent.
 The MSCI world equity index and the Thomson Reuters global
stock index were also higher, up around 0.1 percent to 0.2
percent, but neither could eclipse emerging stocks as the
standout gainer.
 The index rose 0.7 percent in early trade to a
near-three-year high, fuelled by robust manufacturing numbers
from India and China and fund flows back into emerging market
equities.
 Chinese factory data proved particularly supportive as it
showed production rose while cost inflation slowed, easing
concerns over further monetary tightening by Beijing.
 Building on these later in the session will be the latest
U.S. ISM numbers, due out at 1400 GMT, which, while expected to
weaken slightly to 61 from 61.4, would still remain strong,
adding weight to the recovery theme.
The Nikkei proved the major loser in overnight Asian trade,
closing down 0.5 percent after hitting technical resistance and
on concerns about corporate profits in the wake of its recent
natural disasters.

 BUNDS FALTER, PORTUGAL FRAGILE
 The pre-jobs report, risk-on mode was also evident in the
currency markets as the yen fell to a 10-month low against the
euro and slid beneath a key technical level against the dollar,
which could be set for further gains.
 ""A strong non-farm payrolls number would be reflected in the
dollar/yen and it could rise to 84.50 in the short term,"" said
Simon Derrick, head of currency research, at Bank of New York
Mellon. ""We expect to see prolonged yen weakness due to loose
monetary and fiscal policy in Japan.""
 The dollar was up 0.6 percent to 83.65 yen at 1028 GMT,
after earlier hitting a six-week high of 83.748 yen on trading
platform EBS and rising above its 200-day moving average against
the yen.
 The dollar also firmed 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies and strengthened against the euro to $1.4149.
 Among commodities, Brent crude futures hit a four-week high
near $118 a barrel on prospects for increased demand from the
United States, the world's biggest importer, before scaling back
to trade flat around $117.
 Portuguese government bonds were hit again on Friday, a day
after yields tested fresh record highs, with a successful,
extraordinary debt auction to friendly buyers failing to win
over the broader market.
 The Portuguese/German 10-year government bond yield spread
was steady on the day, but outright yields were slightly
higher, with five-year yields up 13 basis points at 9.78
percent.
 The peripheral euro zone nation -- seen next in line by the
markets for an international bailout -- missed its 2010 budget
deficit target in the previous session, prompting a widening in
its spread to benchmark bunds.
 Elsewhere, Irish bonds were steady after the bank
stress-test results, while bund futures were down 24 ticks,
continuing a broad downtrend since the start of the year, as
traders position themselves for a European Central Bank interest
rate rise next week.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2011 04:20AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-G20 keeps up snail's pace of global monetary reform," * Surface progress at G20 seminar belies big differences	
 * How to add yuan to SDR basket is latest cause of dispute	
 * West hopes to advance cause of Chinese reformers	
 
 By Alan Wheatley, Global Economics Correspondent	
 BEIJING, April 1 (Reuters) - Another month, another
inconclusive meeting of G20 finance ministers: reform of the
international monetary system is proving a hard, thankless slog.	
 True, Thursday's seminar in the eastern city of Nanjing
confirmed the consensus that changes are needed to put the world
economy on a firmer financial footing, keep a closer eye on
capital flows and ensure the global monetary order better
reflects the clout of China and other emerging giants.	
 But the devil is in the detail, and, for all the ministerial
proclamations of progress, the latest talks served mainly to
show that French President Nicolas Sarkozy will have his work
cut out to devise a reform blueprint in time for a summit in
November.	
 France is this year's chair of the Group of 20 leading
economies [ID:nL3E7EV06].	
 One analyst, Citi's Steven Englander, was struck by the
Alice-in-Wonderland feel to Thursday's gathering.	
 ""So there is this meeting in Nanjing where all countries but
one are trying to figure out how to get rid of the dollar as the
world's major reserve currency, one country is trying to keep
its currency as the world's major reserve currency but have it
depreciate against all the others, and one country wants its
currency to become a reserve currency but doesn't want anyone to
buy it without permission.	
 ""The intended outcome is reform of the international
monetary system,"" Englander said in a note.	
 The country trying to preserve its hegemony is, of course,
the United States. The aspiring reserve-currency country that
wants to have its cake and eat it, too, is China.	
 
 LOCKING HORNS	
 The tug of war between the two led to a stalemate at
February's Paris G20 over whether a big current account surplus
or deficit is a good indicator of an unbalanced economy. The
answer might seem obvious. But China, feeling picked upon
because of its hefty surplus, dug in its heels and objected.	
 The bone of contention in Nanjing was over the conditions
for including the yuan in the Special Drawing Right (SDR), the
International Monetary Fund's quasi-currency that is part
reserve asset and part in-house accounting unit.	
 The technical aspects of the debate are arcane, but the
political significance is straightforward.	
 Adding the yuan to the basket of four currencies that now
make up the SDR would confer prestige on China but also impose
responsibilities: for the step to be of practical importance and
not just a symbol of China's rise, the currency would have to be
freely convertible and no longer semi-pegged to the dollar.	
 And that, for China, is a two-step too far. Beijing wants to
dismantle capital controls and free up the yuan, also known as
the renminbi (RMB), on a timetable of its own choosing. So being
in the SDR would be nice, but it is not a paramount objective.	
 ""If everyone welcomes the yuan's inclusion in the SDR, we'll
also be happy to see that happening a bit early. But we are not
in a hurry. We are patient,"" Chinese central bank governor Zhou
Xiaochuan said after the meeting.	
 
 CHANGE IN THE OFFING?	
 Privately, Western ministers and central bank governors hope
that laying out the terms of entry will give ammunition to
reformers such as Zhou who are locked in constant battle with
conservatives over the pace of financial liberalisation.	
 ""Nothing happens immediately, but it certainly sets the
stage for those inside China who want to say 'look at what the
world is prepared to give us if we do a bit more reform',"" Jim
O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said.	
 O'Neill, who took part in the Nanjing seminar, judged that
the talks had brought the yuan's inclusion in the SDR a step
closer and speculated that the IMF might not wait until its next
scheduled review of the SDR basket in 2015 to change its
make-up.	
 ""Obviously it isn't going to happen right now, but the
consensus that the RMB should be in the SDR pretty soon suggests
to me that they are going to find some way of getting round the
capital convertibility criterion,"" he said.	
 After all, O'Neill and others noted, not even the German
mark was fully convertible when it was included in the SDR.
Where there's a political will, there's a way.	
 
 MEANING OF INDEPENDENCE	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner raised eyebrows in
Nanjing by insisting that a country whose currency is part of
the SDR should have an independent central bank. [ID:nL3E7EV0FC]	
 This would appear to be erecting a new barrier to the yuan
because the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is far from
independent.	
 But Eswar Prasad from the Brookings Institution, a
Washington think tank, said Geithner was not demanding legal
independence. Rather, he was signalling the need for China to
scrap the yuan's peg to the dollar so the PBOC can focus
squarely on fighting inflation without worrying about the impact
on the exchange rate.	
 ""He was trying to make the point that currency flexibility
has to be associated with a central bank that is allowed to get
on with its main job of focusing on price stability,"" said
Prasad, who was also in Nanjing.	
 Comments by Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of
France, lent weight to this interpretation.	
 ""The basic idea is that, to have the SDR truly reflect
stable currencies over time, you need to be sure that each
currency that is part of the basket has a monetary policy that
is conducted in a credible way and an independent way,"" he told
a news conference.	
 Seen in that light, the West is giving Chinese proponents of
reform another card to play in their internal political battles.
The independence criterion should not be unsurmountable.	
 So does that mean there was some substance to the Nanjing
talking shop and that the divergences on display mask an
emerging consensus? Not quite.	
 ""While there was agreement on general principles, when it
came to specifics there was clearly a bit of dissension,"" said
Prasad, a former IMF official who is also now a trade professor
at Cornell University.	
 At least G20 ministers will not have to wait long to have
another crack at narrowing their differences. They meet yet
again in mid-April, this time in Washington.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - The euro zone's manufacturing
sector remained buoyant last month, allowing factories to ramp
up their prices at the fastest rate since at least late 2002, a
business survey showed on Friday.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), which records manufacturing activity across all the major
euro area economies, dipped to 57.5 last month from February's
near 11-year high of 59.0.
 The figure was revised down from a flash reading of 57.7 but
marked the index's 18th month above the 50 mark dividing growth
from contraction.
 But in a worrying sign for policymakers, the resurgence
remained two-speed, with a weaker performance in Spain and
continued sub-50 readings in Greece masked by surging output
growth in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
 The euro zone manufacturing PMI output index dropped to 58.5
from the previous month's 61.4 and the flash estimate of 58.9.
 ""Despite the slight easing since February, the data are
consistent with industrial production growing at a quarterly
rate of 2 percent, spearheading the region's recovery,"" said
Chris Williamson at data compiler Markit.
 The euro zone economy grew 0.3 percent in the final three
months of 2010 but is expected to have expanded 0.5 percent in
the first quarter of this year.
 Earlier data from Germany showed its manufacturing sector
grew at a slightly slower pace than February's record high,
while in neighbouring France growth also slowed. Spain saw a
downturn in growth from February's 10-month high and Italy's PMI
fell from the previous month's 11-year high.
 
 PRICE INFLATION
 The output price index bounced to 61.5 last month, revised
up from a flash reading of 61.4, hitting its highest level since
Markit began tracking such prices in November 2002.
 Official data released on Thursday showed consumer prices
rose 2.6 percent in March, up from 2.4 percent in February and
ahead of expectations for 2.3 percent.
 ""The record jump in average prices charged for goods will
further encourage the European Central Bank to increase interest
rates sooner rather than later, which may drive further
divergences among member states as higher borrowing costs hit
already weak demand in the periphery,"" Williamson said.
 The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest
rates from a record low 1.0 percent next week and follow with a
couple more hikes by the end of the year as it focuses on
controlling inflation, a Reuters poll showed.

 By Ngo Thi Ngoc Chau and John Ruwitch	
 HANOI, April 1 (Reuters) - Vietnam's central bank raised two
key interest rates on Friday as it battles soaring inflation,
which economists expect to be exacerbated by rising fuel prices.	
 The State Bank of Vietnam hiked the reverse repurchase rate
which it charges banks for loans via open market operations to
13 percent from 12 percent, according to an announcement seen by
Reuters. A central bank official confirmed the change.	
 The bank also lifted the refinance rate to 13 percent from
12 percent where it had stood since March 8, the central bank
said in an announcement.	
 The Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said in a
report that the increase in the OMO rate would ""contribute to
reining in credit and money growth"".	
 ""As inflation pressures persist, we expect the SBV will need
to hike its key interest rates further to 14-15 percent this
year, which will set the stage for more moderate inflation and
higher growth in 2012,"" it said.	
 The Vietnamese government has been grappling with
double-digit inflation for several months, and in February
announced it would tighten monetary and fiscal policy to
stabilise the economy.	
 The State Bank of Vietnam has increased several key interest
rates, some multiple times, since Feb. 17.	
 
 The latest interest rate hikes come after the government's
General Statistics Office released data this week and last that
showed economic growth decelerating but inflation remaining
high.	
 The annual consumer price index in March rose 13.89 percent,
the GSO said, its highest level in 25 months. [ID:nSGE72N01C]	
 On Tuesday the Finance Ministry announced increases in the
price of petrol by 10.36 percent and raised the price of diesel
by 15.3 percent. It was the second double-digit hike in fuel
prices since late February.	
 The ministry said it expected the fuel price rises to add
0.4 percentage point to the monthly consumer price index in
April.	
 Dragon Capital, a Vietnam-focused fund management firm, said
it now expected annual inflation to a peak above 16 percent and
remain over 15 percent through the third quarter before ending
the year at 12-13.5 percent.	
 Meanwhile, economic growth slowed to 5.43 percent in the
first quarter of the year from 7.34 percent in the last quarter
of 2010, which some economists interpreted as evidence that the
government's measures to stabilise the economy were starting to
bite. [ID:nSGE72S016]	
 The central bank's last increase of the reverse repurchase
rate was on Feb. 22, when it hiked the rate by 100 basis points.
It has been increased 6 percentage points since early November
in the face of high inflation.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2011 03:04AM ET</span>",Turkish March PMI eases to 5-month low of 56.1," ISTANBUL, April 1 (Reuters) - Turkey's manufacturing sector
expanded at its slowest pace in five months in March as growth
in new orders slowed, partly due to unrest in the Middle East,
while input price acceleration eased, a survey showed on Friday.
 The HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Turkey fell to
56.1 points in March from a record high of 58.5 in February --
its weakest level since last October, but still well above the
50 point mark separating growth from contraction.
The input price index weakened to 77.4 points from a record
high of 79.5 points, data firm Markit reported.
""The slight slowdown in the rate of expansion was caused by
output and new orders, both of which also expanded at slightly
lower, but still markedly strong rates. There was a solid
slowdown in new export order growth, possibly reflective of
uncertainties in the Middle East & North Africa region,"" said
Murat Ulgen, chief economist for Turkey at HSBC.
 North Africa and the Middle East have become increasingly
important markets for Turkish exports, particularly amid fragile
euro zone growth. The Arab world accounted for 22 percent of
Turkish exports in 2010.
 The data will send mixed messages to the central bank, which
is battling to keep credit growth in Turkey to 20-25 percent
this year after loans last year rose 34 percent, fuelling a
domestic demand boom which sent GDP up 8.9 percent.
 Slower manufacturing growth may signal that credit growth is
finally calming after the central bank raised banks' required
reserve ratios in December and January and made another surprise
hike last week.
 But persistent price acceleration is keeping the bank under
pressure to convince the markets it has inflation in hand,
particularly given its reluctance to raise interest rates.
 ""While input and output prices rose at slower rates than in
February, they both continued to signal pipeline inflationary
pressures in the manufacturing industry,"" Ulgen said.
 Turkey's consumer inflation fell to a 41-year low in
February of 4.16 percent but producer price inflation of 10.87
percent fanned concern the bank may fall behind the curve if it
fails to ditch its new policy mix and raise its policy rate from
a record low of 6.25 percent.
 Central bank governor Yilmaz said last week the bank's
measures had been sufficient. 
 But much stronger than expected fourth-quarter GDP again
raised fears of economic overheating.
 According to the PMI data, Turkey's manufacturing sector has
now seen monthly growth since May 2009, following 18 months of
contraction.

 By Richard Leong	
 HONG KONG, April 1 (Reuters) - Asian shares outside Japan
rose to their highest in nearly three years on Friday, looking
to extend a three-quarter winning streak, while the yen slipped
on the view Japanese interest rates will stay near zero for a
long time to help the quake-ravaged economy.	
 MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan
hit its highest level since May 2008 on optimism
about global economic growth. It was up 0.63 percent to 489.10
at 0630 GMT.	
 Japan's Nikkei was up till shortly before the close,
but then slipped back into negative territory, falling 0.48
percent to 9708.39. A weaker yen is seen as supportive of the
nation's exporters during a period of domestic rebuilding but
the country's struggle to recover will be a long-term one. 
 The resilience of most Asian stock market in the face of
geopolitical risks indicates further gains are likely, but some
investors cautioned the upswing might be overdone and is
vulnerable to deterioration with Japan's nuclear predicament,
Europe's debt crisis and/or  Middle East's political situation.	
 ""The markets have absorbed these events pretty well, but
things are still very fluid,"" said Binay Chandgothia, portfolio
manager at Principal Global Investors in Hong Kong. The firm
manages more than $200 billion in assets worldwide.	
 In commodity trading, U.S. oil prices started the new
quarter by climbing after closing at their highest in 2-1/2
years on Thursday against the backdrop of continued fighting in
Libya and unrest in the Middle East.	
 Gold, which had a 10th straight quarterly gain in the
January-March period, fell on more tough inflation talk from
U.S. central bankers.	
 While risky assets generally shone on the first day of the
new quarter, investors are treading cautiously ahead of the
latest payroll data from the United States later on Friday.	
 Another month of solid U.S. hiring, expected in the 200,000
area, should reinforce expectations of further global economic
expansion but also of an accelerated shift in policy focus among
central bankers to stem inflationary pressure.	
 ""At the moment, we're getting dragged higher by the momentum
we're seeing in the U.S. economy,"" said IG Markets analyst Ben
Potter in Melbourne.	
 Signs of improving business activity and rising inflation
globally have led the U.S. Fed and the European Central Bank to
ratchet up their inflation rhetoric, causing traders to
second-guess whether U.S. and European rates will be on hold
this year.	
 In the U.S., Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota
told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the Fed could
raise rates by the end of 2011, far sooner than expected by
financial markets. Most analysts do not expect rate hikes until
the second half of 2012. See [ID:nN31230020]	
 
 INFLATION TALK BOOSTS DOLLAR 
 A recent spate of hawkish comments from Fed officials has
helped boost the dollar and U.S. bond yields with two-year
yields rising to 0.84 percent, the highest in six weeks.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.21 percent at
76.018. It climbed to a six-week high against the Japanese
currency as it has recovered from a record low of 76.25
yen on March 17 before G7 central banks intervened to halt the
yen's rise. It last traded at 83.53 yen.	
 The euro also strengthened against the yen,
hitting a fresh 10-month high of 118.66, in the wake of a
weaker-than-expected BOJ tankan business survey. 
 Growing expectations of the Fed hiking rates and the BOJ
leaving rates steady have widened the yield differential between
two-year U.S. and Japan government debt. That gap touched above
63 basis points, the widest since early February. 
 Japan will likely stick to a near-zero rate policy as the
world's No. 3 economy faces the risk of a slowdown due to the
March 11 natural disasters and the ongoing nuclear crisis. 
 In the latest developments, a local newspaper reported that
the government will take control of Tokyo Electric Power
whose shares and public image have been hammered after
a series of missteps and mistakes at its quake-stricken
Fukushima nuclear plant. [ID:nL3E7EV46V]	
 At a G20 meeting in Nanjing, China, Japan's top currency
diplomat said on Thursday his country, while satisfied with last
month's rare coordinated move to stem yen's rise, will stay
vigilant for further invention needs. [ID:nL3E7EV1V2]	
 In addition to Japan, tension in Africa and the Middle East
and the festering public debt problems in Europe are other
factors that threaten global growth. But those concerns have
receded for now, analysts say, as most economies have showed
steady growth, which will further stoke the rise in oil, food
and commodity prices. 
 U.S. crude  was up 15 cents at $106.88 a barrel after
earlier touching $107.65, an intraday peak since September 2008.
Brent crude  fell 13 cents to $117.23. 
 Spot gold traded at $1,432.80 an ounce, down from
$1,436.48 late in New York on Thursday, after hitting a record
high of $1,447.40 in March.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, April 1 (Reuters) - The yen slid to a
10-month low against the euro and fell below its 200-day moving
average versus the dollar on Friday, poised for more weakness as
widening yield differences increased the appeal of using the yen
to fund investments in other currencies.	
 The yen came under renewed pressure after comments from a
U.S. Federal Reserve official gave traders more reason to think
the Fed will raise interest rates before the Bank of Japan,
underscoring the diverging outlook for their monetary policies.	
 The BOJ will likely lag behind the Fed and the European
Central Bank in raising interest rates, especially in the wake
of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan's
northeast.	
 Such market expectations have stirred talk of a revival in
the yen carry trade, which involves selling the low-yielding yen
to fund investment in higher-yielding currencies and assets.
[ID:nL3E7EV00H]	
 ""The global economy is in relatively good shape, equities
are performing solidly and volatility has been low,"" said Koji
Fukaya, director of global foreign exchange research at Credit
Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 ""In this risk-on environment, there is a growing contrast in
monetary policies among the G3, and that situation is likely
leading to some yen carry trades,"" Fukaya said, adding that the
dollar could rise to around 86 yen by the end of June.	
 The dollar rose above its 200-day moving average against the
yen at 83.63 yen for the first time since June, a sign that the
yen's uptrend may be coming to an end. 
 Since the Lehman crisis, the dollar has never risen more
than 4 yen above the 200-day moving average, said Masato Chin,
president of Chin Associates, adding that the next possible
target for the dollar is 4 yen above its moving average.	
 If the dollar rises above that level it would likely signal
that the yen has hit a historic peak with its rise in March,
Chin added.	
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent to 83.56 yen . It
touched a six-week high of 83.748 yen on trading platform EBS
earlier, and the next major peak on daily charts is its
mid-February peak of 83.98 yen. 
 The dollar tumbled to a post-World War Two record low of
76.25 yen in March, as the yen surged on the back of market
speculation that Japanese investors may repatriate funds from
abroad after the earthquake.	
 There has been little sign that such repatriation has taken
place, and the yen later fell back after the Group of Seven
industrialised nations intervened jointly to sell the yen on
March 18. Japan conducted a total of 692.5 billion yen ($8.4
billion) in FX intervention in March, the Ministry of Finance
said on Thursday.

 YEN'S BROAD FALL	
 The yen fell broadly on the crosses, hitting an 11-month low
against the Australian dollar and its lowest in more than 10
months against the euro.	
 The single European currency rose as high as 118.675 yen
on trading platform EBS, the euro's highest since
against the yen since mid-May 2010. The euro last stood at
118.40 yen, up 0.6 percent on the day.	
 The dollar gained a lift against the yen after the Wall
Street Journal reported that Minneapolis Federal Reserve
President Narayana Kocherlakota signaled the Fed could raise
interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point by the
end of the year. [ID:nN31167243]	
 A recent series of hawkish comments by Fed officials have
helped drive U.S. Treasury yields higher this week and caused
the dollar's yield advantage over the yen to widen.	
 Still, not all market players are convinced that investors
have regained their appetite for carry trades just yet.	
 Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchange at State Street
Global Markets in Tokyo, said there was little sign that global
investors have regained their appetite for carry trades. 
 ""What is happening now is just a reaction to the fact that
the yen had been bought without much meaning,"" Tomita said,
referring to the yen's surge in March that was partly driven by
speculation about possible Japanese repatriation.	
 Later on Friday, focus turns to the closely watched U.S.
non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT. Forecasts centre on a
rise of 190,000 jobs in March, a Reuters poll showed.	
 The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0346, hovering
near a 29-year high of $1.0373 hit on Thursday.

 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.3 percent at
76.071. The greenback has rebounded against the yen, a move that
has propelled Asian stock markets because it would help the
region's exporters. 
 The MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.08 percent on the day, but Japan's
Nikkei was down 0.50 percent, erasing early gains.	
 U.S. crude  was up 70 cents at $107.42 a barrel, while
Brent crude  rose 31 cents to $117.67. 
 Spot gold traded at $1,432.55 an ounce, down from
$1,436.48 late in New York on Thursday.

(Adds analyst quote, details)	
 By Rie Ishiguro	
 TOKYO, April 1 (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business
sentiment improved slightly in the three months to March, the
Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan survey showed, but
analysts anticipate a downturn in confidence this quarter
following last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami and a
subsequent nuclear safety crisis.	
 Policymakers and analysts warn that widespread power outages
and supply chain disruptions from the March 11 quake will
severely damage factory output and delay the economy's return to
a moderate recovery.	
 The BOJ's quarterly tankan survey showed the headline index
for big manufacturers' sentiment improved to plus 6 in March
from plus 5 in December, compared with a median market forecast
of plus 7.	
 But 72 percent of replies for the survey came in before the
earthquake, which means it did not much reflect the impact of
the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that flattened coastal
towns and cities in the country's northeast, killed more than
11,000 and triggered the world's worst atomic crisis in 25
years.	
 The BOJ will release reference data for pre-quake and
post-quake sentiment at 8:50 a.m. Monday (2350GMT Sunday).	
 ""Today's data alone won't be of much use so the reference
data next week was something that was needed,"" said Takeshi
Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in
Tokyo.	
 ""We're focusing on when companies see reconstruction demand
picking up. But we can assume business conditions will be very
severe ahead.""	
 The index for June was seen at plus 2, showing that
companies expected business conditions to worsen over the next
three months . 
 The sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the
percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those
who say they are good. Negative readings mean pessimists
outnumber optimists.

 By Kazunori Takada and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 1 (Reuters) - Japan plans to take control of
Tokyo Electric Power Co , the operator of the country's
stricken nuclear plant, in the face of mounting public concerns
over the crisis and a huge potential compensation bill, a
newspaper reported on Friday.	
 Shares of the company, also known as TEPCO, fell as much as
10 percent after the Mainichi newspaper said the government
plans to inject public funds into the firm, although it is
unlikely to take more than a 50 percent stake.	
 ""It will be a type of injection that will allow the
government to have a certain level of (management) involvement,""
the daily quoted a government official as saying. ""If the stake
goes over 50 percent, it will be nationalised. But that's not
what we are considering.""	
 Peppered with questions about TEPCO, Japan's Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano told a news conference the government had
not decided on how it would support the company but buying a
stake had not been ruled out.	
 Analysts say more palatable options for the government may
include meeting some or all of TEPCO's compensation liabilities,
letting it raise electricity prices or spinning off and
nationalising the company's nuclear business alone.
[ID:nL3E7ET1BC]	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said TEPCO should remain in
private hands .	
 ""TEPCO has been operating as a private company. As I
said, now we would need to support them, but I would basically
like for TEPCO to work hard as a private company,"" he told a
news conference. 
 TEPCO has come under fire for its handling of the
emergency at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex, triggered by
a March 11 earthquake and tsunami that left more than 28,000
people dead or missing.	
 A series of missteps and mistakes, combined with scant signs
of leadership, have undermined confidence in the company. Shares
in TEPCO are down 80 percent since the disaster, wiping out
about $32 billion in market value.	
 The stock fell to an intraday low of 399 yen on Friday,
near a lifetime low of 393 yen dating back to 1951, and closed
down 3.7 percent at 449 yen. 
 Including this week's round of emergency loans from lenders
and some $64 billion in bonds, TEPCO now has around $115 billion
in debt versus equity at the end of December of about $35
billion.	
 The cost of insuring against debt default or restructuring
by TEPCO fell on the newspaper report. The company's five-year
credit default swap spread narrowed to 335/375 basis points from
a record high of 475 basis points reached earlier this week,
according to Markit, a financial information company.	
 TEPCO domestic bonds maturing within three years were
quoted to yield around 200-500 basis points over Japanese
government bonds on Friday, Thomson Reuters publication IFR
reported. Before the quake, they were about 10 basis points over
JGBs. 


 
 SUPPORT NOT NATIONALISATION?	
 TEPCO said it was unaware of any government plan to inject
public funds into it, adding now was not the time to discuss the
future structure of the company.	
 While government intervention is seen as positive for TEPCO
debtholders, shareholders risk further losses.	
 ""Putting TEPCO under government control is not necessarily
good for the company's shareholders because TEPCO would probably
be overwhelmed to repay the public money for a long time and
won't be able to return anything to investors,"" said Fujio Ando,
an adviser at Chibagin Asset Management.	
 ""In any case, they will have to make clear who will be
taking responsibility. They can't keep their current management,
that's something people would not want to see.""	
 Anger against the company has seen protests outside its
Tokyo headquarters, with people demanding an end to nuclear
power and calling the company ""criminal"".	
 The company could face compensation claims topping $130
billion if the nuclear crisis drags on, Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch estimated this week, further fuelling expectations the
government would step in to save Asia's largest utility.	
 
 EVACUATION ZONE	
 More than 70,000 people have been evacuated from a 20-km (12
mile) exclusion zone and another 130,000, who live in a 10 km (6
miles) band beyond the exclusion zone, have been advised to
leave, or to stay indoors.	
 ""If TEPCO can stabilise their nuclear plant quickly,
compensation claims will likely be less than 1 trillion yen
($12 billion) with payments limited to reimbursing farmers for
lost crops,"" Nomura Holdings analyst Shigeki Matsumoto said.	
 ""However, if it remains unstable, meaning long term or
permanent evacuation, then the cost will balloon beyond TEPCO's
means. In that case, the government will have to pick up the
portion of compensation costs that TEPCO can't pay.""	
 Some experts say a final resolution of the nuclear disaster
is likely to take decades and there could be many further
setbacks. [ID:nN30198196]	
 Under law, TEPCO could be exempt from compensation for
nuclear accidents caused by natural disasters. But Mainichi
quoted the official as saying it would not be possible to apply
the legislation given strong public sentiment.	
 Investor concern about TEPCO mounted after its president,
Masataka Shimizu, was admitted to hospital this week and the
company said 2 trillion yen in emergency loans from Japan's
major banks would not cover its rising costs.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2011 06:32PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-World reserves hit 9.3 $trillion; US dollar share up," (Updates to add table)
 NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's share of
known global currency reserves rose slightly in the fourth
quarter, while total central bank holdings hit a record above
$9 trillion, International Monetary Fund data showed on
Thursday.
 Between October and December, the dollar's share of the
roughly $5.12 trillion of world reserves of which the
composition is known increased to 61.4 percent from 61.3
percent in the prior quarter.
 Overall reserve accumulation rose for a seventh straight
quarter, soaring to $9.258 trillion as of the end of December.
 The euro saw a modest decline in its share of known
reserves to 26.3 percent from 26.9 percent and the yen's share
rose to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent.
 The share of ""other currencies,"" which excludes the dollar,
euro, yen, sterling and Swiss franc, rose further to 4.4
percent from 4.0 percent in the third quarter of 2010.
 For table on world FX reserves in Q4, see [ID:nN31186026]
 ""All told, COFER data for the fourth quarter supports the
notion that central banks are sticking to relatively stable
allocations of major currencies (the U.S. dollar and euro)
rather than pursuing aggressive diversification strategies,""
Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura in New
York, wrote in a research note.
 ""Furthermore, the data suggest renewed demand for 'other'
currencies and the yen. The continuation of this trend will be
a supportive factor for currencies such as the Canadian and
Australian dollars and could also mean that yen strength will
persist for longer than most anticipate,"" he said.
 Interest has grown in currencies such as the Australian and
Canadian dollars in recent years and some central banks have
talked of increasing allocation to these currencies as well as
the yen.
 In the fourth quarter of 2009, the share of ""other
currencies"" in known global reserves stood at around 3
percent.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - The euro firmed against the
U.S. dollar in the first quarter, buoyed by expectations of
euro zone rate hikes, but gains could stall in the next few
weeks due to nagging peripheral debt concerns.
 Technical indicators suggested the euro was in the midst of
a correction to the downside after gaining 6 percent in 27 days
from its low of $1.3428 on Feb. 14 to last week's high at
$1.4249. The $1.4249 level is the euro's resistance, and if
that goes, euro bulls could target $1.4283, the Nov 4 peak.
 On the way down, analysts said a strong break below the key
$1.4000 psychological level would signal a shift in the euro's
uptrend, with downside support at $1.3850.
 More importantly, the fundamental outlook for the euro zone
remains cloudy, particularly at the periphery, even though an
interest rate increase seems imminent at a European Central
Bank monetary policy meeting next week.
 ""In our view, the euro will weaken on a longer-term horizon
... There's an awful lot of (rate hikes) priced in at the
moment and that's because of the change in language from ECB
President (Jean-Claude) Trichet,"" said Frances Hudson,
investment director for strategy at Standard Life Investments
in Edinburgh.
 Standard Life has about $214 billion in assets under
management and the firm maintains a long dollar/short euro
position in its Global Absolute Return Strategy portfolio.
 ""If the ECB does hike, they would not hike massively. One
percent to 1.25 is not a big leap. After the first move, they
will wait and give it time and see what happens,"" Hudson said.
 The latest challenge to the euro zone was a bank stress
test in Ireland released on Thursday, which indicated that the
country's banks need another 24 billion euros in capital to
plug potential losses. For more, click on [ID:nLDE72U2EF].
 Analysts said the capital requirements would be tough to
meet and at some point the Irish government would have to
restructure the whole banking industry. This should weigh on
the euro as it begins the second quarter.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro rose 0.4 percent to
$1.4178 . It has gained 6 percent against the dollar
and 8 percent against the yen in the first quarter, largely due
to the outlook that the ECB would raise rates well before the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.

points of ECB hikes in 12 months from a low 1.0 percent.

 In the options market, benchmark volatilities implied by
one-month at-the-money euro/dollar options  fell to

debt worries were not at the forefront for investors.
 Six-month  and one-year implied vols 
remained elevated though, trading at 11.5 percent and 12.35
percent respectively.
 Markets were also looking to Friday's U.S. payrolls report,
which could likely dictate the euro's direction against the
dollar in the near term.
 Economists polled by Reuters have estimated 190,000 jobs
were added to non-farm payrolls in March after payrolls
expanded by 192,000 jobs in February.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index fell 0.4 percent to 75.872
<.DXY>, dropping 4 percent in the first quarter as the euro,
the currency with the largest share in the index, surged. Some
analysts have started to raise their forecasts on the dollar
given increasing hawkishness from Fed speakers.
 The latest Fed speaker to raise the need for higher U.S.
interest rates was Minneapolis Fed President Narayana
Kocherlakota, who said on Thursday that the fed needs to raise
rates by 75 basis points in 2011. See [ID:nWEN0344]

 * Hochberg optimistic goal of doubling exports will be met
 WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has
become more aggressive in financing exports to help the United
States move ahead of China and Germany to become the world's
largest exporter of manufactured goods, the head of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank said on Thursday.
 ""We are the number one manufacturer in the world,"" Eximbank
President Fred Hochberg said in a speech at the bank's annual
conference.
 ""However, when it comes to selling overseas, we fall to
number three behind China and Germany. And that is
unacceptable,"" Hochberg said.
 Many of the biggest U.S. companies face ""unfair""
competition from other government export agencies as they try
to make sales around the world, he said.
 A recent example involved a $500 million rail project to
supply 150 diesel-electric locomotives to Pakistan.
 Pakistan officials told U.S. manufacturer GE  that
they preferred the GE locomotives.
 But the Chinese government offered below-market financing
that gave the Chinese manufacturer ""an advantage that GE could
not make up in quality, price or service,"" Hochberg said.
 The U.S. Eximbank put together a competitive financing
package ""to match China,"" even though it involved offering more
generous rates than usual, he said.
 ""This significant policy change meant an American company
could compete solely on the quality and value of its products
and the services it provides. And they would not be undercut
because of unfair terms,"" Hochberg said.
 The transaction is still up in the air as Pakistan has not
made a final decision yet, he told reporters.
 Eximbank was able to match China's cheap financing terms
without any subsidies, Hochberg said.
 President Barack Obama last year set a goal of doubling
U.S. exports to more than $3 trillion by 2015 to help stimulate
economic growth and create jobs.
 Hochberg said he was optimistic that goal would be met, in
part because of an estimated $21 trillion in global
infrastructure spending expected over the next 10 years.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world
markets headed for their third straight quarter of gains on
Thursday and commodities surged, feeding inflationary pressure
that could boost equities further.
 Global stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, hit three-week highs and were poised to
close the first quarter up 4.0 percent. The index rose 0.2
percent and was up a total of 22 percent in the two previous
quarters.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was flat
but still 7 percent higher for the quarter after gaining 18
percent in the previous six months.
 In commodities, prices of wheat , corn  and
soybeans  -- raw materials for bread, syrup and animal
feed -- rose by as much as 5 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  jumped 2 percent to 2-1/2 year highs.
Brent crude oil was poised to finish the quarter up 24 percent
as the best performing major asset.
 Oil prices rose as Middle East protests and Libya's
conflict kept threats to supply in focus. Grains shot up as
strong demand ate into stockpiles.
 Analysts said they expected price pressures from
commodities to channel into other markets, pushing up shares of
natural resource producers.
 ""To see another couple of percent moves in stocks going
into the end of the second quarter will not surprise us at
all,"" said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial
Services, which manages over $500 million, in Suffern, New
York.
 ""We think commodity-related stocks such as Mosaic ,
Cliss Natural Resources and Deere  will particularly do
well, although we could see more market volatility as the QE 2
nears its June expiry,"" Pursche said, referring to the Federal
Reserve's $600 billion stimulus effort, which proved to be the
lifeblood of capital markets.
 Despite strong quarterly gains, Wall Street has recorded
some of the year's lightest trading over the last week as
investors played safe by riding on winning stocks.
 Prices on Thursday were little changed, with investors
reluctant to make big bets before Friday's monthly employment
report. For more see [.N]
 By 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), the Dow <.DJI> was up 2.04 points,

<.SPX> was up 0.36 point, or 0.03 percent, at 1,328.62. For the
quarter, it was up 5.6 percent as of Wednesday's close.
 The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 1.23 points, or
0.04 percent, at 2,778.02 and has risen 4.7 percent in the
quarter.
 ""I think at this point, the market deserves the bullish

oil-producing countries, debt panic in Ireland and other

 ECB MULLS RATE HIKE
 The euro rose on expectations the European Central Bank
will raise interest rates in April despite the euro zone debt
crisis, which intensified on Thursday.
[ID:nLDE72U17E][ID:nWLA6919] [USD/]
 Portugal's budget deficit reached 8.6 percent of gross
domestic product in 2010, above a target of 7.3 percent agreed
with the EU.
 The yield premium investors demand to hold Portuguese bonds
rather than benchmark German bonds rose to 508 basis points, 12
bps wider on the day, as the country's 10-year yields
 hit 8.476 percent.
 Despite the financial mess faced by some nations, the ECB
has signalled it could raise rates next week to curb inflation,
a message that has kept the euro strong against other
currencies.
 The yen fell to a 10-month low of 117.90 versus the euro

 By Aaron Maasho
 NAIROBI, March 31 (Reuters) - Global trade talks meant to
help poor countries prosper are ""on the verge of failure"" due to
vast differences among countries, the head of the World Trade
Organisation said on Thursday.
 The Doha Round of world trade talks has been dogged by
disagreements over how far the United States and the European
Union should cut farm subsidies and tariffs -- and how far major
developing countries should open their markets in exchange.
 ""The Doha Round is on the verge of failure. Leaders of the
G20 said they wanted to conclude talks by Easter, but that won't
happen,"" Lamy told journalists in Nairobi after talks with
Kenyan officials.
 Leaders of the world's richest nations have identified 2011
as a ""window of opportunity"". Lamy said earlier this month he
expected negotiators to present an initial version of a draft
final agreement covering subsidies, anti-dumping rules,
non-tariff barriers and other regulatory elements by late April.
 Lamy blamed the lack of a breakthrough on some countries
which he said preferred bilateral trade deals to a global deal.
 ""Big players may believe they can go the bilateral way, but
most WTO members know the place they can go to where (they) can
get a fairer system of international trade is the multilateral
place,"" he said.
 Since their start in 2001, the talks have stalled
repeatedly, most recently in July 2008. Some experts said
earlier this year that 2011 might be the last chance to secure a
deal.
 Countries including Mexico and Indonesia have said failure
would damage the multilateral rules-based trading system that is
umpired by the WTO and is credited with having prevented a
return to 1930s-style protectionism during the financial crisis.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2011 02:20PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-EU states back extending U.S. biodiesel duties-sources," BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - European Union governments on
Thursday approved the extension of import duties on U.S.-made
biodiesel after hearing evidence that U.S. exporters had been
evading EU tariffs by shipping via Canada, sources said.
 Representatives of EU countries gave majority backing to
extend duties worth up to about 400 euros per tonne to biodiesel
arriving from Canada, the sources said.
 The vote follows a year of investigations prompted by
suspicions that U.S. exporters were smuggling their goods into
the EU via third countries to avoid the tariffs.
 The duties, which should stay in place until 2014, aim to
counteract what the EU says are illegal U.S. subsidies for
biodiesel blenders and illegal pricing by exporters.
 However, the EU's executive Commission backed down from a
previous plan to extend duties even further, to all biodiesel
blends arriving from the Unites States, the sources said. 
 Currently, only diesel blends containing at least 20 percent
of biodiesel are subject to the tariff.

 (Adds quote from additional source, background) 
 BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - European Union governments on
Thursday endorsed a five-year import tariff on imports of glossy
paper from China, the EU's first challenge to Chinese state
subsidies, diplomatic and industry sources said.
 Representatives from EU capitals gave majority backing to
the duties, worth up to 39.1 percent, during a meeting in
Brussels, the sources said. The duties are to be launched by May
17, replacing provisional duties in place since late last year.
 The European Union's executive Commission proposed the
long-term duties after it ruled that China gives illegal
subsidies to its paper makers, and that exporters dump paper on
the EU market at artificially low prices. China has denied this.
 Although the sector is small -- Europe imported about 130
million euros' worth of Chinese coated fine paper in 2009 for
brochures and coffee-table books -- its challenge could trigger
similar moves in other areas.
""There is a general feeling that the Chinese are subsidising
a lot, so there is an interest in sending a political signal
that this will be tackled,"" said one source.
 ""Now the question is whether China will start a legal
challenge,"" the source said.
 China may challenge the EU's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
duties at the World Trade Organization. Beijing scored an
important victory there earlier this month, when the WTO ruled
that the United States had broken international trade law when
it applied dual duties to certain Chinese goods.
 The EU Commission, which leads EU trade policy, has said its
dual duties are legal.
 The Chinese operations of Indonesia's Asia Pulp & Paper
(APP) face a duty of 20 percent, the sources said.

(Adds quotes, updates prices)
 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - The euro has put in a banner
performance in 2011 but the second quarter will be challenging,
with euro zone debt issues moving back to the forefront and
perhaps a shift in expectations for Federal Reserve policy.
 Portuguese government bond yields hit fresh highs on
Thursday, highlighting debt issues in peripheral euro zone
member countries are far from over.
 Portugal's IGCP debt agency said on Thursday it will hold
an extraordinary auction on Friday of up to 1.5 billion euros
($2.13 billion) of 2012 bonds because of demand for that
issue.
 ""Peripheral debt issues have taken a backseat to monetary
policy for most of this year, but that should change in the
coming months,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist
at Wells Fargo in New York, who sees the euro drifting slightly
lower to $1.40 by the end of June.
 ""May will be a big month for Spain in terms of its debt,
while June is an important month for Portugal,"" he said.
 The euro gained nearly 6 percent against the dollar and 8
percent against the yen in the first quarter, largely due to
the outlook the European Central Bank would raise rates well
before the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 Stronger-than-expected euro zone inflation data on Thursday
reinforced foreasts of an ECB rate hike next week. For details,
see The euro was last up 0.4 percent at $1.4184 and against the
yen was up 0.3 percent at 117.41.
 Futures markets see 125 basis points of ECB tightening over
the next 12 months from a record low 1.0 percent.
 The euro briefly pared gains against the dollar on Thursday
after Reuters quoted sources saying the ECB would not announce
plans for a new liquidity facility to help Irish banks. Most
analysts, however, contend Ireland was not a big risk to the
euro since there is no systemic risk due to the euro zone
rescue fund.
 ""The euro has priced in a lot of good news, so it's hard to
see it moving rapidly higher. But it can definitely continue on
the upside,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency analyst at Barclays
Capital.
 ""The ECB wants to show they are concerned about inflation,
but there are clearly other risks and they have kept the full
allotment of open market operations, given concerns about
financial stability.""
 In the options market, volatility was generally pressured,
with 1 month EUR/USD extending recent 11-month lows to 9.7 amid
sales of 1-week vol from 10.7-10.4.
 The euro also hit a 10-month high versus the yen at around
117.90 yen.
 While the euro remains volatile, Friday's U.S. payrolls
report could be the most likely catalyst for either a break
above the November 2010 highs or a drop below the recent
trading range, Wells Fargo's Serebriakov said.
 Economists polled by Reuters have estimated 190,000 jobs
were added to non-farm payrolls in March after those payrolls
expanded by 192,000 jobs in February.
 ""A strong payrolls report would firm the dollar and could
very well have an influence on Fed policy,"" he said. ""If the
Fed becomes more hawkish in 2011, expect the euro to suffer.""
 Serebriakov said he sees the euro dropping to $1.34 by the
end of the year.
The dollar rose to a three-week high of 83.21 yen before
running into selling by Japanese banks and foreign players
along with some fiscal year-end yen demand from Japanese
exporters. It last traded at 82.76.
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 29-year high of $1.0362
after favorable retail sales and credit growth data.

 * High levels of radiation continue near crippled plants
 * Thousands still living in makeshift shelters
 * Animals said to be eating each other in evacuation zone
(Fixes link)	
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, April 1 (Reuters) - Japan's nuclear and humanitarian
crisis stretched to three weeks on Friday with radiation still
leaking from a crippled nuclear power plant, thousands of
homeless people struggling to rebuild their lives, and little
hope of a quick resolution to either.	
 As Tokyo Electric Power Co tries to regain control
of its stricken nuclear plant in the face of mounting public
criticism and a huge potential compensation bill, the government
was reportedly moving to take control of the utility.
[ID:nL3E7EV46V]	
 The government said it had yet to decide on how to support
the utility, which is grappling with the world's worst nuclear
crisis since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and may have to deal
with compensation claims topping $130 billion according to one
U.S. investment bank.	
 Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano held his daily
news briefing on Friday having swapped his 'bosai fuku'
emergency jacket for a suit for the first time since the early
days of the disaster in an apparent effort to portray a return
to normality, but angry Japanese see very little change.	
 ""We have changed our clothes to show that the government is
stepping into the next stage towards restoration and
reconstruction,"" said Edano.	
 In the devastated northeast, many Japanese still see only
the splintered remains of their homes and lives after a 9.0
magnitude earthquake and tsunami on March 11, leaving around
28,000 people dead or missing.	
 
 Radiation 4,000 times the legal limit has been detected in
seawater near the plant as contaminated water used to try and
cool down reactor rods leaks or spills into the ocean, and high
levels of radiation outside a 20 km (12 mile) exclusion zone has
put pressure on Japan to widen the no-man's land.	
 More than 172,400 people were still living in shelters
around northeast Japan. Many devastated areas looked like a
rubbish-strewn junkyard, with cars lodged in the side of toppled
buildings and boats still high and dry on roads.	
 More than 70,000 have been evacuated from the exclusion ring
and another 136,000 who live in a 10-km (6-mile) zone beyond
that have been encouraged to leave or to stay indoors.	
 Despite his positive message, Edano said the evacuation of
people from near the damaged Fukushima Daiichi complex, 240 km
(150 miles) north of Tokyo, would be a ""long-term"" operation.	
 Nuclear experts say it could take years, possibly decades to
make the area around the plants safe.	
 With thousands still missing and many areas off-limits to
rescuers due to the high levels of radiation, Japanese and U.S.
forces will soon begin a joint search for bodies. 
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan is under enormous pressure as he
struggles to manage Japan's toughest test since World War Two.	
 The damage bill may top $300 billion, making it the world's
costliest natural disaster, and raising concerns about the
world's third-biggest economy.	
 Japanese manufacturing activity slumped to a two-year low in
March and posted the sharpest monthly fall on record as the
quake and tsunami hit supply chains and output. [ID:nLHE7EO00C]	
 Japan's government may need to spend over 10 trillion yen
($120 billion) in emergency budgets for disaster relief and
reconstruction, the country's deputy finance minister, Mitsuru
Sakurai, signalled on Thursday. [ID:nL3E7EV0H6] 
 
 RADIATION FEARS CONTINUE	
 France -- the most nuclear-dependent country in the world --
called for new global nuclear rules and proposed a global
conference in France for May as President Nicolas Sarkozy made a
quick visit to Tokyo on Thursday to show support. 
 France is a global leader in the nuclear industry, and Paris
has flown in experts from state-owned nuclear reactor maker
Areva  to work with Japanese engineers.	
 Other nations are also scrambling to help Japan.	
 The United States and Germany are sending robots to help
repair and explore the damaged Daiichi plant. Kyodo said some
140 U.S. military radiation safety experts would soon visit to
offer technical help.	
 U.S. nuclear workers were being recruited to join the
recovery teams at Fukushima and will begin flying in on Sunday.
[ID:nnN31284409]	
 ""These are not 'jumpers' rushing into a room. TEPCO is
bringing in robots to help limit human exposure to high levels
of radiation,"" said Joe Melanson, a recruiter at specialist
nuclear industry staffing firm Bartlett Nuclear in Plymouth,
Massachusetts.	
 ""Jumpers"" is the industry term for people who enter highly
radioactive environments to quickly perform a task. The practice
was common in the United States in the 1970s and early 80s.	
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says
the situation at the Fukushima plant remains very serious,
already has two teams in Japan, monitoring radiation levels. 
 The Japanese disaster has revived heated debate over the
safety and benefits of atomic power.	
 The controversy took an alarming twist in Switzerland when
a parcel bomb exploded at the office of the national nuclear
lobby, injuring two employees. It was not known who sent it.	
 
 ""CANNIBALISATION"" 
 Illustrating the terrible and surreal times through which
Japan is living, one newborn baby's first medical appointment
was not with a paediatrician, but a Geiger counter. 
 ""I am so scared about radiation,"" Misato Nagashima said as
she took her baby Rio, born four days after the earthquake and
disaster, for a screening at a city in Fukushima prefecture. 
 Trade Minister Banri Kaieda said chickens and pigs left
behind by farmers in the evacuation zone were resorting to
desperate means. ""A considerable amount of time has passed and I
am hearing there were episodes of cannibalisation,"" he said. 
 The U.N. atomic agency IAEA said radiation at a village 40
km (25 miles) away exceeded a criterion for evacuation, while
the head of a group of independent radiation experts said Japan
must hand out iodine tablets now and as widely as possible to
avoid a potential leap in thyroid cancers.	
 Government officials are pleading for Japanese, and the
world, to avoid overreacting to what they say are still low-risk
levels of radiation away from the plant. 
 Food and milk shipments from the region have been stopped,
decimating the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen. Various
nations have banned food imports from the area.	
 Contaminated milk was one of the biggest causes of thyroid
cancer after the nuclear accident in Chernobyl because people
near the plant kept drinking milk from local cows.	
 Life in Tokyo, the capital of 13 million people, was slowly
returning to normal from the early days of the disaster when
train service was patchy, workers stayed home and groceries like
bread, milk, toilet paper and diapers were rare.	
 But Tokyo residents still worry about the spread of
radiation and another big quake.	
 ""I only go as far from home as I can walk back and I take
emergency gear with me,"" said Noriko Ariura, rummaging in a bag
holding a radio, flashlight, bottled water and medicine.

(Adds graphic on yen)
 By Jennifer Ablan and Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Japan will repatriate more
funds than markets expect to finance its reconstruction efforts
following its devastating earthquake and tsunami, Mohamed
El-Erian, co-chief investment officer of top bond fund PIMCO,
said on Thursday.
 A significant repatriation of Japanese overseas investments
would likely strengthen the yen despite efforts by the Bank of
Japan to curb the currency's appreciation and protect the
country's exporters.
 ""Right now people say there will be very little
repatriation. I look at the numbers and I believe there will be
more repatriation than the markets think right now,"" El-Erian,
who helps oversee more than $1.1 trillion in assets at the
Newport Beach, California-based firm, said in an interview with
Chrystia Freeland, Reuters Global Editor at Large. To see
video, click on http://link.reuters.com/qyv78r
 To a lesser extent, El-Erian expects Japan to resort to
additional government borrowing and monetization of its debt to
help fund an estimated $300 billion worth of rebuilding.
 ""I think it will be a combination of all three,"" he said.
 Forecasts that Japan will issue a large amount of debt in
coming years are mostly based on the experience of the Kobe
quake in 1995, El-Erian said. This time, however, the country's
debt situation is much more complicated, he said.
 ""The Japanese are inherently cautious. They recognize that
the debt dynamics are at a state where you don't want to take
chances.""
 Japan's debt burden currently stands at 200 percent of its
gross domestic product, compared with about 85 percent when
Kobe struck.
 Japan will also be ""tempted"" to print money to pay for the
reconstruction bill. But concerns about inflation and higher
interest rates will likely limit that option too, El-Erian
said, noting that higher interest rates would have negative
consequences given the country's massive debt burden.
 Last week, the International Monetary Fund said that even
if Japanese insurers were to sell foreign assets to pay
rebuilding claims, it believes that would not materially affect
the yen's value.
 El-Erian said the U.S. dollar, the euro and the yen all
have ""issues"" right now, and he has consequently been using
those currencies to fund purchases of currencies of
""successful"" and higher-yielding emerging markets.
 But PIMCO can adjust the composition of the currencies it
uses to fund those so-called carry trades if the yen
strengthens due to repatriation flows, he said. For the yen's
historical move, click on http://r.reuters.com/zag78r
 GOING BACK TO TREASURIES?
 PIMCO, which earlier this month said its Total Return Fund
had dumped all its holdings of U.S. government debt, would
reconsider dipping back into that market, including Treasuries,
if it sees value in them again, El-Erian said.
 PIMCO decided to sell out of its position in Treasuries
last month because, he said, ""we were finding Treasury-like
instruments offering better value elsewhere.
 ""If the valuations of Treasuries get cheaper, we will
revisit that"" decision, El-Erian said.
 To see video, click on http://link.reuters.com/maw78r
 Bill Gross, who shares the title of co-chief investment
officer at PIMCO and oversees the $236.9 billion Total Return
Fund, has repeatedly warned against U.S. deficit spending and
its inflationary impact, which undermines the value of
government debt and pushes up yields as investors demand more
compensation for risk.

to curb inflation, a message that has kept the euro strong
against other currencies.
 The yen fell to a fresh 10-month low versus the euro and
touched a three-week trough against the U.S. dollar as

central banks in raising interest rates. So far this year, the

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2011 10:40AM ET</span>",UPDATE 4-WTO raps U.S. subsidies to Boeing," * Aid included unfair research payments from NASA
 * Verdict follows WTO ruling against Airbus last year
 * Both sides claim the edge in world's largest trade row

(Adds EU to appeal)
 By Tim Hepher and Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, March 31 (Reuters) - Planemaker Boeing received at
least $5.3 billion of illegal U.S. subsidies, the World Trade
Organization said on Thursday in a dispute that shows no signs
of an end to years of inconclusive wrangling.
 The banned aid included $2.6 billion of research funding
from space agency NASA. But a WTO verdict sparked an immediate
row over whether trade judges were right to include more than $2
billion of further support on the charge sheet against Boeing.
 The ruling is the latest chapter in a six-year battle
between the industry's two giants. The spat has already entered
the record books as the world's largest and costliest trade
dispute.
 The WTO verdict backs some, but not all, of a tit-for-tat
legal case over Boeing aid brought by the European Union.
 A separate WTO trade panel condemned European support for
Boeing rival Airbus in a parallel case last year.
 As so often in a row which now extends to 2,000 pages of
complex trade court rulings, both sides claimed victory.
 ""This WTO panel report clearly shows that Boeing has
received huge subsidies in the past and continues to receive
significant subsidies today,"" European Union trade chief Karel
De Gucht said.
 Airbus, part of European aerospace group EADS, said it had
lost $45 billion in plane sales because of the subsidies. Boeing
has made similar claims about the impact of Airbus subsidies.
 In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said the
ruling vindicated a longtime U.S. position that ""the subsidies
the Europeans give to Airbus dwarf anything that the U.S.
government does for Boeing"".
 According to the United States, the European subsidies for
Airbus faulted by the WTO last year exceeded $20 billion.
 As the latest telephone book-sized report was wheeled out of
WTO offices in Geneva, the companies at the heart of the dispute
opened fire with another salvo of claims through the media.
 ""It's time for Boeing to stop denying or minimizing the
massive illegal subsidies it gets,"" said Rainer Ohler, head of
public affairs and communications at Toulouse-based Airbus.
 Boeing acknowledged receiving $2.7 billion of aid on top of
a dispute that has already been aired, but accused its rival of
diverting attention from more pernicious types of European aid.
 ""This WTO ruling shatters the convenient myth that European
governments must illegally subsidize Airbus to counter U.S.
government assistance to Boeing,"" said Michael Luttig, executive
vice-president and general counsel at Boeing.
 Speaking in private, however, sources involved in the case
clashed over whether the $5.3 billion figure cited by the WTO
against Boeing was a fair account of where it went wrong.
 The figure includes $2.2 billion of export assistance under
a previous assistance programme known as Foreign Sales
Corporations, which the U.S. says is defunct.
 ""It is interesting but irrelevant,"" a U.S. source said.
 A European source said Boeing was still living off the
benefits of the scheme even though it had been scrapped.
 The WTO judges appeared to shy away from going over ground
well covered in earlier rulings, saying they had nothing to add.
 Both sides can appeal the ruling, as they did when the WTO
focused on Airbus. That appeal verdict is expected next month.
 Sources familiar with the case said the EU could appeal as
early as Friday in a tactical move aimed at reducing the time
gap between the two cases.
 
 LENGTHY PROCESS
 The dispute over the $2 trillion plane market is a running
sore in relations between the world's trading superpowers.
 Most recently, it spilled over into a politically charged
battle for a contract to supply air tankers to the Pentagon,
which was first awarded to Airbus but eventually went to Boeing.
 The WTO decisions could help determine how not only Airbus
and Boeing, but future competitors in China, Russia, Brazil,
Japan and Canada, run their fast-growing aircraft sectors.
 Boeing Chairman Jim McNerney hailed what he called a
""dramatic victory"" in clarifying rules and suggested this would
prove helpful as China challenges the Airbus and Boeing duopoly.
 However, analysts say it could be years before appeals are
exhausted and the case can lead to any trade sanctions.
 ""Boeing began its complaint with a strong argument, but
Europe's counter-complaint has muddied the waters,"" said
aircraft analyst Richard Aboulafia of Virgina-based Teal Group.
 ""At the end of the day it won't matter much. Both sides will
continue to see exactly what they want to see, and will do
exactly what they want to do.""
 Even if the WTO verdicts against both sides are upheld, both
sides disagree over what that would mean for the future.
 The WTO has criticised public loans to Airbus, especially
for the world's largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo.
 The United States has warned Airbus not to go back to its
host governments -- Britain, France, Germany and Spain -- for
similarly structured loans for its next plane, the A350. 
 But an EU official insisted the ability of governments to
use the loans system in the future had not been altered.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - The euro outperformed rival
currencies on Thursday as inflation data firmed expectations
the European Central Bank would raise interest rates, but the
currency's strength may prove temporary with peripheral debt
issues seen persisting in the second quarter.
 Traders said significant quarter-end flows helped boost the
euro at the expense of the dollar in particular.
 Official euro zone estimates showed consumer prices jumped
2.6 percent year-on-year in March, up from 2.4 percent in
February and above forecasts.
 Jens Nordvig, global head of FX strategy at Nomura
Securities in New York. said an ECB rate hike at its next
monetary policy meeting on April 7 was a ""done deal.""
 Comments from ECB policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi Wednesday
implied the central bank's policy would gradually raise rates.
Markets see the tightening cycle starting in April.
 The euro gained nearly 6 percent against the dollar in the
first quarter, partly on expectations the ECB would raise rates
well before the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 ""The first quarter we saw a generally weak dollar
environment, an ECB turning hawkish, and the risk premium being
taken out of the euro,"" Nordvig said.
 The euro briefly pared gains against the dollar after
Reuters quoted sources as saying the ECB would not announce
plans for a new liquidity facility to help Irish banks. The
euro fell to $1.4176 from $1.4185 just before the report. The
euro was still up 0.4 percent from the prior New York close.
 Most analysts contend Ireland was not a big risk to the
euro since there is no systemic risk due to the euro zone
rescue fund.
 In the options market, volatility was generally pressured,
with 1 month EUR/USD extending recent 11-month lows to 9.7 amid
sales of 1-week vol from 10.7-10.4.
 The euro also hit a 10-month high versus the yen at around
117.90 yen.
 ""The euro has priced in a lot of good news, so it's hard to
see it moving rapidly higher. But it can definitely continue on
the upside,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency analyst at Barclays
Capital.
 ""The ECB wants to show they are concerned about inflation,
but there are clearly other risks and they have kept the full
allotment of open market operations, given concerns about
financial stability.""
 Anticipation that Japan would buck the global tightening
cycle and leave interest rates low to support its quake-hit
economy encouraged players to sell the yen to fund
higher-yielding investments in a revival of the carry trade.
 The dollar rose to a three-week high of 83.21 yen before
running into selling by Japanese banks and foreign players
along with some fiscal year-end yen demand from Japanese
exporters.
 Strong offers were seen from 83.30 to 83.50, with more
around 84.00. It last traded at 82.73.
 ""The yen should trade in the 80-85 range over the near
term, but we should see a break to the upside in the
secondquarter,"" said Nomura's Nordvig.
 Nordvig recommended six-month dollar calls in dollar/yen.
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 29-year high of $1.0362
after favorable retail sales and credit growth data.

 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - After a first quarter in which
seismic political upheaval in the Middle East has pushed oil
prices up some $20 a barrel, investors and companies are
struggling to gauge the political risks for the rest of 2011.
 While global equities look to be finishing the quarter in
positive territory on robust growth hopes, many market players
and corporate planners admit that politics is likely to
determine how the rest of the year will play out.
 In the last week, daily moves on oil and cocoa markets have
been driven by the ebb and flow of new civil wars in Libya and
Ivory Coast. Company contingency plans have been tested to their
limits by Libya, the wider ""Arab Spring"" and Japan's earthquake.
 The rejection of austerity measures by Portugal's parliament
this month shows the euro zone debt crisis is far from over. And
political attempts to tackle it have been potentially further
dented by Chancellor Angela Merkel's defeat in important state
polls as her opponents benefited from Japan's nuclear crisis.
 In the background, a host of potent geopolitical issues --
from growing strains between Israel and neighbours to Korean
peninsula confrontation and perhaps Western-China tensions --
simmer at a higher temperature than in previous years.
 Veteran market players say they have not seen such a wide
range of political market drivers since the early 1990s, when
the collapse of communism, first Gulf War and European exchange
rate crisis followed in quick succession. Such events often
frustrate economic and market models, they say, and many market
players are too young to have experience handling them.
 ""Financial markets are very, very bad at dealing with
political risk,"" said Paul Donovan, chief global economist at
UBS. ""Not that many traders recall what (it) is all about.""
 While a handful of economists and market analysts have tried
to build models to predict revolutions or otherwise begin to
numerically quantify political dangers, others are simply
scanning the news more closely to react quickly to events.
 Ultimately, it might never be possible to predict that the
self-immolation of a vegetable seller in Tunisia would spark
uprisings in half a dozen states and war in Libya -- or that the
Japanese quake could influence election results in Germany.
 Charles Robertson, chief global economist for Renaissance
Capital, said some in markets were turning to one variable they
could roughly model -- weather -- as a guide to the immediate
future on the streets of the Middle East.
 WATCHING THE WEATHER?
 ""There's a consensus developing that... politics will cool
down as the temperature heats up, so May-September will be
calmer,"" he said -- but in the longer term he believed regional
unrest would return.
 With elections coming up next year in the U.S., France,
Russia and a change of key leadership positions due in China,
many politicians are likely to be focused on domestic issues --
making global coordination to tackle issues much harder.
 Political risk consultancies such as Eurasia Group say they
have seen an uptick in demand for their services as investors
try to assess which crises could spiral out of control and which
might peter out.
 ""That's where expertise really comes in,"" said Eurasia Group
president Ian Bremmer. ""There are risks you need to watch
closely but there are also some that are overstated.""
 Bremmer said he believed the oil-rich rulers of the Gulf --
particularly number one global producer Saudi Arabia -- were
stronger than some have suggested and should withstand ongoing
protest relatively intact.
 The ""fat tail"" fringe risk of wider conflict in the Middle
East remained small, he said. Nonetheless, the danger had risen
sharply with heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions and with
rulers in Syria and Iran under growing domestic pressure, which
could drive them to take a tougher anti-Israeli line.
 He said Europe could expect more street unrest such as that
seen in London last weekend -- again, some of the worst in two
decades -- but with relatively little policy impact.
 
 NORTH KOREA, CYBER THREATS
 While North Korea had been relatively quiet this year after
a lethal cross-border artillery exchange with South Korea and
warship sinking last year, he said it remained a major danger to
the global economy ahead of a likely leadership transition.
 The rise of cyber attacks could also have unpredictable
consequences, he said. A growing number of countries have
complained of mounting hacking attempts and other attacks often
blamed on China, although security experts say proving direct
state involvement is often impossible.
 Overall, it was the growing rivalry between emerging powers
such as China and developed states led by the U.S. that would
have the greatest impact on currency, commodity and other assets
in the months and years ahead, Eurasia's Bremmer said.
 ""It's the global rebalancing and aftermath of the
(financial) crisis that is really driving this rising political
risk,"" he said. 
 For some reeling from the events of the recent months, the
main lesson is simply to expect the unexpected.
 One oil executive said all the expertise in the world only
got one so far: ""My main take-away here is that nobody seems
capable of forecasting the actual events.""

 * Commits to continue providing funds
 * But appears to shelve plan for new liquidity facility
 * Disagreements over plan within Governing Council
 
 (rewrites throughout, adds quotes, details, background)
 By Marc Jones and John O'Donnell
 FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - The European
Central Bank threw a lifeline to Irish banks on Thursday by
suspending collateral requirements for loans to them, but it
stepped back from a more ambitious plan to create a new funding
facility for the banks.
 As Ireland released results of stress tests of the health of
its banks, revealing a 24 billion euro capital shortfall among
them, the ECB said it would no longer insist on minimum credit
ratings for Irish sovereign debt, or for debt guaranteed by the
Irish government, when accepting it as collateral in money
market operations. [ID:nLDE72T20R]
 That will help Irish banks, which are major holders of their
country's debt, continue to borrow in ECB operations if
Ireland's bonds are downgraded further. Last year the ECB took a
similar step to aid Greek banks.
 Ireland's banks are heavily dependent on ECB funding, in the
form of short-term loans of up to three months, because other
euro zone banks refuse to lend to them in open markets. On top
of the 85 billion euros which they borrowed from the ECB in
February, Irish banks took a record 70 billion euros in
emergency funding from the Irish central bank.
 But while the ECB suspended collateral requirements, it did
not proceed with broader plans to establish a new facility that
would provide medium-term funding to Irish banks and potentially
banks from other weak euro zone states in future.
 This facility, by providing loans with longer tenors than
ECB money market loans, might be cheaper for the banks. It would
also relieve the Irish central bank of a burden by taking the
place of its emergency aid.
 The idea for the facility had been broadly welcomed by
financial markets, where it was seen as an important tool in the
euro zone's fight against the debt crises in weaker economies.
 
 DISAGREEMENTS
 A euro zone central bank source had told Reuters last week
that the ECB was close to finalising plans for the facility. But
official euro zone sources said on Thursday that the ECB would
not announce the plans because of internal disagreements within
the central bank's Governing Council.
 ""There will not be a formal structure through which
medium-term funding will flow either from the central bank or
from one of the European funds that are now being put in place,""
Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan said.
 ""But there is assurance from the European Central Bank that
there will be a medium-term flow of money which underpins the
restructuring and will continue into future years,"" he added.
 The news that the ECB would not announce the new facility
hit the euro  slightly on Thursday, though full financial
market reaction will not be clear until European markets reopen
on Friday.
 Ireland's central bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, suggested
their was little hope of the new ECB facility being created in
the near term.
 ""I don't see any prospect of anything imminent on the
cards,"" he told a news conference.
 Two sources with knowledge of the ECB's discussions said
there had been substantial internal opposition to the plans for
the new facility by some of the bank's policymakers.
 ""They underestimated the resistance to the idea in the
Governing Council. There has been a push back...There will be
another week or two of uncertainty,"" one of the sources said.
 ""This is a political negotiation with high stakes. It's a
hard one for them (the ECB) to swallow,"" he added.
 
 HURDLES
 The ECB would have to clear a number of legal hurdles before
putting such a facility in place. 
 There is a risk that it could be challenged in court for
being at odds with the European Treaty that covers the operation
of the euro zone. Since Ireland's banks are now almost
completely state-owned, the facility could potentially be seen
as breaking restrictions on the financing of governments.
 Dutch central bank governor Nout Wellink on Thursday
indicated he wanted the Irish government and perhaps other euro
zone governments to do more to solve the banking problem, not
the ECB.
 The Irish banking sector ""has become a very big black hole"",
he told Dutch public broadcaster NOS.
 ""We (Europe) will take care of the bridging facility but the
Irish will have to solve it. They will have to slim down banks,
slim down very strongly. They will have to close down some
banks. They will have to merge some banks.""
 He added, ""We (the ECB) are not there to finance a budget
deficit nor plug holes of banks which are not solvent.
Governments need to do that. Our boundaries have more or less
been reached.""

 The group emerged as a loose united front to press the rich
Western economies, especially the United States, which
traditionally dominated global diplomacy.	
 But there are many disparities among the BRICS member
countries, and the past two summits of the evolving group have
not achieved much. This time, too, strains over China's currency
policies and trade surpluses could make real agreement even
harder to reach.

 China, with Russia, India, Brazil and other developing
countries have condemned the U.S.-led air strikes on Libyan

 (Recasts after close of meeting)
 By Daniel Flynn and Annika Breidthardt
 NANJING, China, March 31 (Reuters) - Finance ministers made
modest progress on Thursday towards reform of a global monetary
system that French President Nicolas Sarkozy said is so unstable
that it could tip the world economy back into crisis.
 Ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 leading
economies edged towards a consensus on the need to include
China's yuan in the basket of currencies that makes up the
Special Drawing Right, the International Monetary Fund's
in-house money.
 Adding China's currency to the SDR would be a recognition of
China's ever-growing economic clout and would be a concrete step
toward making the global monetary order more representative and,
ministers hope, more solid.
 ""Without rules, the international monetary and financial
system is incapable of forestalling crises, financial bubbles
and the widening of imbalances,"" Sarkozy said in opening a
day-long G20 seminar in this eastern Chinese city.
 ""Without rules and supervision, the world runs the risk of
being condemned to increasingly serious and severe crises,"" he
told an audience that included IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
who is widely expected to run for president against Sarkozy next
year.
 France is the chairman this year of the G20, which brings
together developed and emerging economies accounting for some 85
percent of global output.
 Beijing, despite being asked to host the forum, has not
shown great enthusiasm for Sarkozy's initiative.
 ""The reform process will be long-term and complex,"" Chinese
Vice-Premier Wang Qishan said in his opening remarks.
 
 LET'S GET STUDYING
 China suspects that the West is looking for new levers to
force Beijing to let the yuan, now tightly managed by the
central bank, trade more freely and to dismantle its capital
controls more quickly than it wants to.
 These conflicting interests crystallised in Nanjing over the
conditions for including the yuan, also known as the renminbi
(RMB), in the SDR.
 The SDR, now comprised of the dollar, euro, yen and
sterling, is a synthetic quasi-currency that is mainly used as
an accounting tool for the IMF's internal operations.
 Its reach is otherwise limited -- Libya pegs its currency to
the SDR and transit fees through the Suez Canal are calculated
in SDRs -- but some experts believe the SDR could evolve over
time into an important international reserve asset alongside the
dollar.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said there was no
particular timetable for adding the yuan to the SDR, a step that
would come with strings attached.
 ""We discussed the conditions that apply to belonging to the
SDR basket and in particular we focused on the convertibility
and flexibility of the currency and the relative independence of
the central bank,"" she told a closing news conference.
 Studies along those lines could start soon, she said.
 As much as Beijing would like the kudos that being a
component of the SDR would entail, Chinese officials bristled at
the idea of strict conditions.
 Yi Gang, a vice-governor of the central bank, disputed the
notion -- voiced by European Central Bank Governor Jean-Claude
Trichet among others -- that a currency must be freely-floating
before it can be included in the SDR.
 Yu Yongding, a former central bank policy adviser, took
issue with the demand that an SDR component currency must be
managed by an independent central bank -- a demand most
forcefully articulated by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner.
 The People's Bank of China is far from autonomous: the most
important decisions concerning the exchange rate and monetary
policy are made by Communist Party leaders.
 ""It will take time for the RMB to be part of SDR,"" Yu told
Reuters.
 
 PROGRESS AHEAD?
 Nevertheless, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaueble
said he expected more headway on the issue in coming months.
 ""I believe we made a lot of progress in this direction
today. I am confident that a lot will be achieved in this
direction in the French presidency,"" he said.
 In his prepared remarks for the seminar, Geithner questioned
whether an international effort was really needed to cure the
ills in the global monetary system. Inconsistency in exchange
rate policies was the biggest flaw, he said.
 Without naming China, he noted that some emerging countries
ran tightly-managed currency regimes that fuelled inflation
risks in their own economies, magnified appreciation pressures
in others and also generated calls for protectionism.
 ""This asymmetry in exchange rate policies creates a lot of
tension,"" Geithner said. ""This is the most important problem to
solve in the international monetary system today.""
 But he said the solution was not complicated.
 ""It does not require a new treaty, or a new institution. It
can be achieved by national actions to follow through on the
work we have already begun in the G20 to promote more balanced
growth and address excessive imbalances,"" he said.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2011 09:00AM ET</span>","UPDATE 2-Evraz bullish on 2011 outlook at home, abroad"," * Evraz 2010 net profit $532 mln, Reuters forecast $149 mln
 * EBITDA $2.35 bln, Reuters forecast $2.40 bln
 * Sees Russian demand for construction steel rising
 * Shares up 1.3 percent in London
 
 By Alfred Kueppers
 MOSCOW, March 31 (Reuters) - Evraz, Russia's second largest
steelmaker, expects domestic demand for construction steel to
rise more than 10 percent this year while the global economic
recovery helps lift its foreign operations.
 The optimistic outlook followed smaller peer NLMK's forecast
for a 10 percent increase in output this year as the domestic
market recovers. 
 Evraz, part-owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich, said it
sees first quarter core profit between $725 million and $800
million, putting it on target to meet previously announced
guidance for 2011 underlying earnings of between $3.0 billion
and $3.6 billion.
 ""Provided strong guidance for the first quarter, and if we
see continued strong results in Q2, for example $1 billion, then
the upper range of their earlier forecast...looks quite
realistic,"" Renaissance Capital analyst Boris Krasnojenov said.
 Steel makers in Russia, the world's third-largest producer,
are benefiting from their position as leading low cost producers
after suffering through a difficult 2009 when global steel
demand declined.
 ""We expect Russian demand for construction steel
to grow by more than 10 percent in 2011 compared with 2010,""
chief financial officer Giacomo Baizini said in a statement on
Thursday.
 ""We are also experiencing improved demand from our
international markets as the global economy continues to
recover.""
 Evraz is one of the sector's few global players, with
significant operations in South Africa, the United States and
the European Union, though it produces the majority of its steel
at home.
 It also reported forecast-beating 2010 results on Thursday,
swinging to a $532 million net profit last year from an adjusted
$292 million loss in 2009 thanks to stronger steel prices and
increased output.
 The figure smashed the $149 million Reuters forecast, but
was largely the result of an accounting change.
 ""They changed the method of how they measure depreciation on
PP&E (plant, property and equipment) and that added $600-$700
million to the operating profit line,"" Krasnojenov said.
 Evraz's London-listed GDRs were up $0.41 or 1.0 percent at
$39.7 at 1139 GMT.
 The company also said earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) reached $2.35 billion
last year, up 90 percent on 2009.
 Last year's revenues reached $13.4 billion, up 37 percent
and ahead of the $12.89 billion forecast.
 The shares are trading near the top of their 52-week range
of $21.59-$43.15, but Krasnojenov said further gains are
possible.
 Evraz said last month it is ""considering options"" with
regard to its 40 percent stake in Raspadskaya, which was
Russia's largest coking coal miner until a May, 2010 accident
crippled production at its main mine.
 The RenCap analyst said a sale could result in a
extraordinary dividend payment.
 ""If they sell Raspadskaya, they can use the proceeds for an
extra payout, and the market would like this,"" Krasnojenov said.
 Chief executive Alexander Frolov said in an interview
shareholders could receive an ordinary dividend for the first
half of 2011.
 He did not provide any new details on Raspadskaya.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2011 08:32AM ET</span>","Russia to grow 4.6 pct in 2011, inflation a risk -poll"," By Maya Dyakina and Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW March 31 (Reuters) - Russia will cash in on high oil
prices through better growth and bigger surpluses, but soaring
commodity prices have prompted economists to raise their
inflation forecast this year to 9 percent, a Reuters poll shows.
 The poll estimated economic growth this year of 4.6 percent,
up from 4.2 percent in a poll in February, with analysts citing
stronger industrial production and higher capital investment.
 Inflation of 9 percent this year would exceed the 8.8
percent posted in both 2010 and 2009 and far overshoot the
central bank's 6-7 percent target, according to the median
forecast in a Reuters poll of 16 analysts.
 The forecast is up from the 8.5 percent estimate in last
month's poll, despite some signs of moderating inflation in the
short term, which the central bank thought sufficiently
encouraging to pause in its rate hike cycle in March.
 ""Food prices on global markets are setting records. The
catastrophe in Japan could extend the rising trend, which in the
end must have an impact on the price tags in Russia too,"" said
Alexander Gruzdov, chief analyst at MDM Bank.
 At the same time, ""oil prices are pushing higher, which
leads to an inflow of liquidity onto the domestic market and
thus negates the impact of tighter monetary policy.""
 Russia's Ural's crude export blend is above $110 a barrel,
or nearly 50 percent higher than planned in the government's
budget.
 The advantage of higher oil prices is that they bring in
more money for exporters and boost trade revenues. This means
bigger surpluses, with the trade surplus forecast in the poll
raised to $165 billion, from $140 billion a month ago, and the
current account to $80 billion, from $60 billion. The budget
deficit forecast was cut to 1.5 percent of GDP, from 2.0
percent.
 Rising oil prices also help stimulate economic growth in the
world's biggest oil producer. But higher inflation will take its
toll on consumers, with the retail sales forecast revised down
to 4.6 percent growth this year from 5.1 percent, and real wage
growth also seen lower.
 That leaves Russia in a difficult situation, analysts said.
Economic growth is not strong enough to weather aggressive
interest rate rises, but by leaving policy on hold Russia risks
further fanning inflation and hurting consumer demand.
 ""April is likely to be the last month when the central bank
can raise interest rates to fight inflation expectations,"" said
Anton Nikitin, economist at Renaissance Capital.
 The poll showed the benchmark refinancing rate increasing by
25 basis points by June to 8.25 percent, with the possibility of
one more hike by the end of the year.
 The overnight deposit rate -- seen as the most effective
tool for managing liquidity -- was expected to be hiked more, to
3.50 percent by end-June, to 3.75 percent in the third quarter
and to 4.0 percent by year-end from 3.0 percent now, in line
with the central bank's plan to narrow the gap between different
rates.
 The rouble was seen appreciating in the short term, firming
2.3 percent over the next three months to 32.99 versus the euro
dollar basket thanks to interest rate hikes, high oil prices and
the surpluses.
 ""The rouble remains under a strong influence of fundamental
factors -- the balance of payments surplus could post a record
in the first quarter, topping $40 billion,"" said Maxim Oreshkin,
senior strategist at Credit Agricole.

 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, March 31 (Reuters) - Belarus has brought in a 20-30
day moratorium on changing foreign exchange regulations or
devaluing the rouble, expecting to secure Russian financial aid
by then, a banking source said on Thursday.
 Analysts say a de facto 10 percent rouble  devaluation
announced this week was not enough to support the former Soviet
republic's economy. Talks with Russia on $3 billion in aid may
take longer than Minsk expects as Moscow wants to see a
comprehensive action plan.
 ""Everybody is expecting a devaluation from April 1. This
will not take place from April 1 nor in the following days,"" the
source told Reuters, adding that the decision on a moratorium
was made at a session of the central bank's board on Wednesday.
 The source said this meant that over the 20-30 day period
rules for operating in the internal market would not change.
 ""By that time we expect to get a loan (from Russia),"" the
source said.
 The central bank later on Thursday issued a statement
confirming it had no intention of introducing any additional
foreign exchange controls.
 ""All the measures needed to preserve and increase gold and
foreign currency reserves have been implemented by now,"" it
said. However, the bank made no official pledges on exchange
rate stability.
 Separately, the Finance Ministry sought to reassure
investors, including the holders of Belarus' two Eurobonds,
saying servicing foreign debt was a priority.
 
 FURTHER DEVALUATION MAY BE NEEDED
 On Tuesday, the central bank effectively allowed the
Belarussian rouble to devalue by 10 percent on the interbank
market by widening the trading band for local banks.
 The currency has come under pressure because of a big trade
deficit and generous wage increases and loans handed out by the
government in the run-up to last December's presidential
election, when President Alexander Lukashenko secured a fourth
term.
 Analysts say that Tuesday's move could help Belarus secure
bailout loans from powerful partners such as Russia but would
not by itself fix an unsustainable foreign trade gap.
 ""Our estimates suggest that the fair (exchange) rate may
stand within 3,500-4,000 roubles per dollar now,"" ING said in a
note on Thursday.
 The official rate is 3,045 roubles per dollar.
 ""Therefore, the recent central bank move may turn out to be
not enough,"" ING said.
 The central bank, whose forex reserves fell 20 percent in
the first two months of this year to $4 billion due to the trade
deficit, had prior to Tuesday's move allowed banks to deal at
only 2 percent above or below the official rate.
 Moscow has said it wanted to see a credible anti-crisis plan
before extending loans to Belarus and analysts say the limited
devaluation may have been part of it.
 
 QUEUES FOR FUEL, RAIL TICKETS
 However, the interbank market remains illiquid.
 ""There is barely any interbank market at all,"" said a trader
at one Belarussian bank.
 ""Banks quote foreign currency 10 percent above the central
bank rate but there is no excess foreign currency (that could be
traded), it all goes towards meeting the demand of banks' own
customers.""
 The ""soft"" devaluation, along with the absence of foreign
currency cash at foreign exchange bureaux and planned increases
in fuel and public transport prices, has prompted Belarussians
to spend money on goods rather than keep the rouble.
 Unusually long queues formed at gas stations this week ahead
of a 10 percent price increase announced earlier.
 Minsk residents were also queuing up to buy underground rail
tickets ahead of a 20 percent price hike and the underground
rail operator had to limit sales to two tickets per person.
 Importers of consumer electronics and other durable goods
say demand has risen as Belarussians expect prices to increase
and foresee shortages.
 ""The situation could be described as a crisis,"" said a
businessman who imports computers, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ""Large importers are afraid to import goods because
they expect a devaluation and are unsure about pricing.""

 * Joint intervention more effective than unilateral action
 * Exact total size of G7 intervention not known
(Adds details)	
 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japan conducted a total of 692.5
billion yen ($8.4 billion) in foreign exchange intervention in
March, when Group of Seven (G7) countries conducted their first
joint intervention in more than a decade, the Ministry of
Finance said on Thursday.	
 The Japanese yen has since eased back to around 82.80 yen to
the dollar , compared with a level of 79.50 yen just
before Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on March 18
that the G7 had agreed to step in the currency market. The day
before that, the yen hit a record high of 76.25 yen. 
 The data only covers Japan's intervention and the total size
of the G7 intervention is still not known, although many market
players think Japan did most of the job. 
 But the joint move appears to be working more effectively
than Japan's unilateral intervention in September, when it sold
a record 2.12 trillion yen to stem a rise in the yen.	
 ""The announcement effect of coordinated intervention was
effective, making the latest intervention more efficient,"" said
Teppei Ino, an analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 The data does not specify which currencies were bought and
sold but market players said the Bank of Japan bought the dollar
against the yen.	
 The release from the Finance Ministry simply said the total
amount of foreign exchange intervention operations for the
period from February 25, 2011 through March 29, 2011 was 692.5
billion yen.	
That amount was not too far off market players'
estimates of coordinated intervention of around 530 billion yen,
give or take a few hundred billion yen that had been based on
BOJ money market data.	
 Those estimates were based on several assumptions,
including one that all the yen settlements related to G7
intervention cleared with the BOJ, which some analysts say may
not be the case.	
 Also, if a foreign central bank finances its yen selling by
selling Japanese short-term bills or bonds, the BOJ data may not
capture the flows because the data only shows net, and not
gross, yen payments to banks from the public sector, including
foreign central banks.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Thursday as above-forecast euro zone inflation cemented the case
for higher interest rates from the European Central Bank, though
analysts cautioned against a rapid rise in the currency.
 Traders said significant quarter-end and fiscal year-end
flows were helping to boost the euro, at the expense of the
dollar in particular.
 Official euro zone estimates showed consumer prices jumped
2.6 percent year-on-year in March, up from 2.4 percent in
February and more than market expectations.
 They supported comments from European Central Bank
policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi who on Wednesday implied the
central bank's policy is to gradually raise interest rates.
Markets see the tightening cycle starting in April.
[ID:nLDE72T1ZS]
 ""The euro has priced in a lot of good news so it's hard to
see it moving rapidly higher, but it can definitely continue on
the upside,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency analyst at Barclays
Capital.
 ""The ECB wants to show they are concerned about inflation
but there are clearly other risks and they have kept the full
allotment of open market operations given concerns about
financial stability.""
 Ireland later on Thursday announces the results of stress
tests that are expected to signal the effective nationalisation
of the entire financial system, but few analysts were expecting
a major reaction from the single currency.
 ""Ireland is not a big risk to the euro as there is no
systemic risk thanks to the euro zone rescue fund. Confidence is
being driven by the larger euro zone countries,"" said Manuel
Oliveri, currency analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 The euro rose 0.6 percent against the dollar  to
$1.4220, approaching its 2011 high of $1.4249. Traders cited
demand from European central banks, while adding that a break of
option barriers at $1.4250 would be needed for further momentum
on the upside.
 The single currency hit a 10-month high versus the yen
 around 117.90 yen.
 Given the market's certainty that the ECB will deliver a 25
basis point rate rise next month, analysts said the market's
focus was on how far and how fast rates will continue to rise,
adding that such forecasts will determine the euro's outlook.
""There is nothing in the inflation figures that suggests
that the ECB needs to move forward more aggressively and the
euro is vulnerable to a repricing of tightening risk once next
week's rate hike is out of the way, said Lena Komileva, global
head of G10 strategy at BBH.

 DOLLAR PRESSURED
 The dollar came under broad selling pressure, falling
roughly 0.5 percent against a currency basket <.DXY>.
 Market participants said U.S. investors were likely selling
the dollar to rebalance their portfolios given significant
losses in European and Japanese stock markets this month.
 Despite the U.S. currency's broad losses, it was flat
against the yen at 82.80 yen, as the yen stayed on the backfoot
versus most major currencies.
 Anticipation that Japan would buck the global tightening
cycle and leave interest rates low to support its quake-hit
economy is encouraging players to sell the yen to fund
higher-yielding investments, in a revival of the carry trade
that flourished before the credit crisis began in 2007.
 The dollar rose to a three-week high of 83.21 yen 
before running into selling by Japanese banks and foreign
players along with some fiscal year-end yen demand from Japanese
exporters. Strong offers were seen from 83.30 to 83.50, with
more around 84.00.
 The Australian dollar hit a fresh 29-year high of $1.0362

 (Adds detail, background)
 BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - European Union sanctions on
Ivory Coast remain in force, including an embargo on cocoa
shipments from major exporting port San Pedro, EU diplomats in
Brussels said on Thursday.
 Forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara -- internationally
recognised as the winner of November's presidential election --
seized control of San Pedro overnight, raising hopes of a
resumption in cocoa exports from the world's top producer.
[ID:nLDE72U004
 ""All the sanctions remain in place, including sanctions on
San Pedro port ... No exemptions were foreseen in the initial
list of sanctions,"" one EU diplomat in Brussels told Reuters.
 ""No such (exemption) is actually being discussed, but if
that were to be the case, it would take at least four to five
days to enter into force,"" a second diplomat said.
 The EU placed sanctions on the San Pedro port authority in
January which blocked its cocoa exports to Europe, in an attempt
to stop presidential incumbent Laurent Gbagbo using funds from
the lucrative trade to retain his grip on power.
 Despite Ouattara's forces having taken swathes of territory
in Ivory Coast in recent days, including in the country's
western cocoa-producing belt, the EU is currently ruling out any
sudden end to its sanctions on the west African state.
 The quickest option to resume cocoa exports from Ivory Coast
could be for Ouattara to create a new entity with a separate
administrative and financial structure from the current San
Pedro port authority, one of the EU diplomats said.
 The EU is currently considering extending its sanctions to
new entities and individuals in Ivory Coast, possibly including
adding more officials to the list of people subject to EU visa
bans and asset freezes.
 The U.N. Security Council imposed travel bans and asset
freezes on Gbagbo and his closest associates on Wednesday, with
all 15 council members voting for a resolution that echoes
earlier U.N. calls for Gbagbo to step down and seeking to
prevent use of heavy weapons in Abidjan.

 Tests are expected to reveal an additional 20-25 billion

radical restructuring of the sector, the Irish Independent
newspaper reported.
 ""Ireland is not a big risk to the euro as there is no
systemic risk thanks to the euro zone rescue fund. Confidence is

China more than fulfilled expectations, with progress towards

on Thursday.	
 At the conclusion of a forum of the Group of 20 wealthy and

that comprises the SDR, the International Monetary Fund's unit
of account, would help stabilise the global currency system.	
 Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said that while he

China's yuan, certain conditions had to be met.	
 ""That includes the free convertibility of a currency,"" he
told reporters.

 ""I believe we made a lot of progress in this direction
today. I am confident that a lot will be achieved in this
direction in the French presidency,"" he said.	
 Schaueble also said that he disagreed with the view that
there was too little cash in the global economy, saying that the
key was to get what money is already out there to flow to where
it is most needed.	
 ""I am not very open for ideas to create more liquidity but
rather for a better distribution of liquidity,"" he said.

 LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - The yen hit a fresh 10-month
low versus the euro on Thursday and touched a three-week trough
against the dollar as expectations mounted that Japan would lag
the euro zone and U.S. central banks in raising interest rates.
 Traders said significant quarter-end and fiscal year-end
flows were likely to make trade in the major currency pairs
volatile on the day.
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi on Wednesday implied that the central bank's policy is to
gradually raise interest rates, with markets expecting the
tightening cycle to begin in April.
 Two U.S. Federal Reserve Bank officials on Wednesday said
the Fed needs to exit its unprecedented monetary stimulus,
suggesting the debate over future policy is heating up as the
U.S. central bank nears the end of its current round of
stimulus.
 Anticipation that Japan would buck the global tightening
cycle and leave interest rates low to support its quake-hit
economy is encouraging players to sell the yen to fund
higher-yielding investments, in a revival of the carry trade
that flourished before the credit crisis began in 2007.
 ""Rate differentials are playing a big role, especially as
there is no probability for the BOJ to become more hawkish, even
in the medium- to long-term."" said Manuel Oliveri, currency
strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 ""There is scope for rate expectations to stay supported in
the euro zone. German demand and the service sector is strong so
price rises are likely to become domestically driven, not just
commodity driven,""
 Euro zone flash inflation data for March is due for release
at 0900 GMT, with economists in a Reuters poll forecasting a 2.3
percent rise in prices on the month. 
 The euro rose to 117.54 yen in Asian trade, its highest
since May 2010, up around 0.4 percent on the day.
 ""I see little resistance until 119.90, which was a pivotal
area back in May 2010,"" said a London-based spot trader.
 The dollar rose to a three-week high of 83.21 yen before
running into selling by Japanese banks and foreign players along
with some fiscal year-end yen demand from Japanese exporters.
Strong offers were seen from 83.30 to 83.50, with more around
84.00.
 The dollar was up around 9 percent from its record low of
76.25 yen set on March 17 before G7 central banks intervened in
a rare coordinated move to stem the yen's rise. It was last at
82.85, unchanged on the day.
 Jefferies analyst Naomi Fink said the start of the new
fiscal year could bring more yen selling although it was
unlikely to fall in a straight line.
 ""I see a trend of greater tolerance. Households and
companies have a lot of cash and they will need to invest in
overseas ventures. Overseas investments in the new financial
year should weaken the yen a bit more,"" she said.
 
 STRESS TESTS
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.4180, still within its March
range, with traders saying a break of option barriers at
$1.4250 would be needed for fresh upside momentum.
 BNP Paribas is recommending buying euros from $1.4120 to
target $1.45 with a stop at $1.4020.
 Ireland later on Thursday announces the results of stress
tests that are expected to signal the effective nationalisation
of the entire financial system.
 Tests are expected to reveal an additional 20-25 billion
euro hole in Irish banks' capital and will be followed by a
radical restructuring of the sector, the Irish Independent
newspaper reported.
 ""Ireland is not a big risk to the euro as there is no
systemic risk thanks to the euro zone rescue fund. Confidence is

 * Both forecasts higher than previous estimates
 * Sees slightly higher repo rate vs Dec forecast

(Adds analyst comment, detail, background)
 By Niklas Pollard and Daniel Dickson
 STOCKHOLM, March 31 (Reuters) - Sweden's leading economic
think tank raised its forecast for economic growth to 4.2
percent this year and 3.1 percent in 2012 and said it expected
slightly higher interest rates than previously.
 The National Institute of Economic Research's (NIER)
estimates compared with a previous outlook, published in
December, when it saw the economy growing 3.8 percent in 2011
and 2.9 percent in 2012.
 Following a quick recovery from its worst downturn since
World War 2, Sweden's economy grew at a record pace in the
fourth quarter and expanded 5.5 percent for the full year,
accelerating away from most of its European peers.
 ""The strong recovery of the Swedish economy is continuing,
and the employment rate will rise to a level unsurpassed in 20
years,"" the institute said in a statement.
 ""Unemployment, however, will still be high. It will
therefore be appropriate to keep monetary and fiscal policies
expansionary,"" it added.
 The institute, which supplies forecasts for the government,
said it saw the central bank's key repo rate -- currently at
1.50 percent -- at 2.25 percent by the end of 2011. This
compared with an end-2011 forecast of 2.0 percent in December.
 ""It is a very positive, bright picture of the Swedish
economy. Inflation pressures will remain pretty low, so
therefore the repo rate doesn't need to be raised that much in
the coming years,"" Swedbank analyst Knut Hallberg said.
 ""We have a slightly more restrained view of comsumption in
the coming years (than NIER). We believe higher mortgage rates
will have a bigger impact.""
 NIER said it saw the repo rate rising to 3 percent by the
end of next year.
 But it said monetary as well as fiscal policy remained
expansionary, with the government expected to roll out
additional unfunded measures totalling 5 billion crowns this
year and 25 billion in 2012.
 It saw budget measures in 2012 being more focussed on tax
cuts than expenditure rises.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a three-week
high on Thursday and the euro firmed, but Portuguese government
bond yields hit fresh euro lifetime highs as the country missed
a budget target and its credit rating was downgraded again.
 World stocks have now recovered all of the losses from a
sharp sell-off after disaster struck Japan earlier this month
and are heading for their third quarterly gain in a row thanks
largely to improving U.S. growth.
 But the euro zone debt crisis intensified with news of
Portugal's troubles and ahead of the publication of Irish bank
stress tests.[ID:nLDE72U17E][ID:nWLA6919]
 Portugal's budget deficit reached 8.6 percent of gross
domestic product in 2010, above a target of 7.3 percent agreed
with Brussels, statistics agency INE said on Thursday.
 The yield premium that investors demand to hold Portuguese
rather than benchmark German bonds rose to 508 basis points, 12
bps wider on the day, as the country's 10-year yields
 hit a fresh euro lifetime high of 8.476 percent.
 Portugal's stocks <.PSI20> lost 0.9 percent.
 Despite the debt crisis, the European Central Bank has
continued to signal that it could raise its benchmark interest
rate next week to curb inflation, a message that has kept the
euro strong against other currencies.
 The yen fell to a fresh 10-month low versus the euro and
touched a three-week trough against the dollar as expectations
grew that Japan would lag the euro zone and U.S. central banks
in raising interest rates. So far this year, the euro has risen
nearly 8 percent against the yen.
 ""Rate differentials are playing a big role, especially as
there is no probability for the BOJ to become more hawkish, even
in the medium to long-term."" said Manuel Oliveri, currency
strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 The euro was up 0.6 percent at 117.77 yen  and the
dollar was steady at 82.83 yen  after reaching 83.21 yen
earlier.
 The European common currency was up 0.6 percent at $1.4219
, boosted by quarter-end and fiscal year-end flows,
traders said.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> share index fell 0.5
percent, while Irish shares <.ISEQ> rose 0.5 percent and yields
on Ireland's 10-year government bond  remained
elevated above 10 percent.
 The Irish Independent said Dublin's stress tests would show
an additional 20-25 billion euro hole in its banks capital --
broadly in line with expectations -- and will be followed by a
radical restructuring of the sector. [ID:nLDE72U0DD]
 A source familiar with the process said Ireland would merge
EBS building society into Allied Irish Bank  as part the
overhaul [ID:nDUB003347]. Trading in Allied Irish Bank and Bank
of Ireland  was suspended.
 U.S. stock index futures    were flat to
up 0.1 percent, indicating a steady start on Wall Street.
 
 OIL TENSIONS
 Brent crude  rose 1 percent above $116 a barrel and
were up 22.7 percent for January-March, on track to become the
best performing major asset in the first quarter of 2011 as
political unrest in the oil-rich Middle East and North Africa
ignited supply concerns.
 Copper , however, was down 2.5 percent this quarter.
 Higher oil prices, seen as a tax on global growth, have not
yet knocked world equities off their stride. Global equities
measured by MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>
advanced 0.3 percent, on track for a 4.1 percent gain for
January-March -- the third straight quarterly rise.
 MSCI emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> rose for the third
day, up 0.7 percent and were on track to gain 1.4 percent for
the first quarter, recovering losses from earlier this year when
investors shifted their money to developed market equities on
concerns over inflation in developing countries.
 However, emerging market shares still underperformed
developed market equities, whose strong performance was mainly
driven by gains in U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> is up 6.7 percent this quarter.
 ""While we remain comfortable with being overweight
financials, we see less need in making such hard distinctions
now given the improving background in China and the reduced

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Akiko Takeda	
 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers reduced
their global stock weighting to a 12-year low in March, while
raising their bond weighting to an all-time high as they
lightened risk positions after a devastating earthquake in
Japan, a Reuters survey showed.	
 Fund managers increased their cash position in March to the
highest level since November 2009 after the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami in northeastern Japan severely damaged Tokyo
Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.	
 Money managers also had to actively cut their risk positions
as increasing unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
bolstered global oil prices.	
 ""The massive disaster in Japan was the major factor. But
even leaving that aside, uncertainty was already building due to
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa,"" said Yoshinori
Nagano, a senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.	
 ""The market was relatively stable despite many
uncertainties. There are expectations that investment conditions
will improve potentially, but this doesn't mean that the market
can ease its caution towards taking risks.""	
 Fund managers' average weighting for global equities in
March fell 3.4 percentage points from the previous month to 42.6
percent -- the lowest since January 1999.	
 The weighting for bonds climbed to the highest since the
survey was first compiled in February 1995. It jumped to 49.5
percent in March from 47.6 percent a month earlier.	
 ""Shares prices are expected to be under selling pressure for
a while as the market is still not sure about the impact of the
nuclear problem and power shortages,"" said Yuichi Kodama, an
economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.	
 ""Stocks are likely to be supported later in the year as we
are expecting to see demand related to reconstruction in the
damaged areas, but gains are likely to be limited due to
uncertainty over potential economic growth in the country.""	
 Japanese money managers piled into more cash positions, with
exposure to cash jumping 0.9 percentage point to 5.1 percent --
the highest since November 2009. 
 Their weighting for alternative assets rose by 0.6 point to
1.5 percent in March, while the weighting for property inched up
by 0.1 point to 1.4 percent.	
 The Reuters poll was based on responses from 12 Japan-based
institutional investors, instead of the usual 13 as one company
was unable to finalise its allocation due to the earthquake.

 The poll of asset management companies was conducted March
14-24 when Japan's benchmark Nikkei average rapidly
plunged to a two-year intraday low of 8,227.63 on March 15.	
 The Nikkei regained some strength, climbing to around 9,500
this week as foreign investors flocked to purchase oversold
Japanese shares, but the market lacked the energy to post
convincing gains amid views that the nuclear crisis in Japan was
far from over, equities fund managers said. 
 In terms of regional allocations, fund managers have lowered
their weightings for Japanese stocks and bonds.	
 The equities weighting for Japan fell 0.4 percentage point
to 28.4 percent in March and the bond weighting dropped 1.0
point to 34.8 percent.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - The yen hit a fresh 10-month low
versus the euro on Thursday and touched a three-week trough
against the dollar as expectations mounted that Japan would lag
the euro zone and U.S. central banks in raising interest rates.	
 The dollar's advance slowed into the Asian afternoon with
the March 11 high of 83.30 yen proving tough resistance, while
selling by Japanese banks and foreign players along with some
fiscal year-end yen demand from Japanese exporters pushing the
pair close to the 100-day moving average around 82.60.	
 The yen was unable to recover strongly, however, as hawkish
comments by euro zone and U.S. central bank officials reinforced
the view that the global economic recovery is on track,
bolstering risk-friendly sentiment at the end of a volatile
quarter.	
 Anticipation that Japan would buck the global tightening
cycle and leave interest rates low to support its quake-hit
economy is encouraging players to sell the yen to fund
higher-yielding investments, in a revival of the carry trade
that flourished before the credit crisis began in 2007.	
 ""Interest rate differentials are the strongest driver of the
market. The Fed is starting to communicate to the market that
QE2 is ending in June. The focus is now moving to the exit from
the strategy,"" said Teppei Ino, analyst at Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 ""The dollar is catching up with the euro in terms of
interest rate expectations, as euro rate hike expectations have
been largely priced in.""	
 The dollar rose to 83.21 yen before stepping back to
82.71. At Thursday's high, the dollar was up 9 percent from its
record low of 76.25 yen set on March 17 before G7 central banks
intervened in a rare coordinated move to stem the yen's rise. 
 However, dollar buying fizzled in the face of key resistance
at 83.30 and offers from Japanese exporters at 83.50. A break of
the 100-day moving average around 82.60 may trigger more
selling.	
 The euro rose as high as 117.54 yen , its highest
since May 2010, bringing its gains this year to 8 percent. 
 Jefferies analyst Naomi Fink said the start of the new
fiscal year could bring more yen selling although it was

of its current round of stimulus. [ID:nN30180403]	
 Still, the European Central Bank is set to be the front
runner in the tightening cycle, which is helping the euro across
the board.	
 ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on
Thursday the central bank's policy is to gradually raise
interest rates, while another board member, Juergen Stark, said
rates are exceptionally low, cementing expectations for an April
interest rate hike. 
 ""The barrage of ECB commentary shows a central bank wanting
to keep liquidity operations separate from rate policy; the
agenda has already moved on to how hawkish Mr. (ECB President
Jean-Claude) Trichet will sound at the April 7 press
conference,"" BNP Paribas said in a note to clients.	
 Credit Agricole said the euro may struggle to advance
further against the dollar, however, given that the euro zone
rate outlook is largely priced in.	
 The bank said the correlation between euro/dollar and the
three-month eurozone-U.S. interest rate spread stands at 0.95,
showing an extremely close relationship.	
 Investors are also nervous about the risk that the euro zone
debt crisis may spread to other peripheral countries.

(Recasts with executive comments)	
 By Alison Leung	
 HONG KONG, March 31 (Reuters) - Russia's United Company
RUSAL Plc , the world's top aluminium maker, said its
2010 net profit more than tripled, beating forecasts, and
expects strong global demand for the light metal to continue
this year.	
 RUSAL shares rose more than 4 percent to their highest
level in more than a month, outperforming a 0.4 percent rise in
the broader market .	
 ""The emerging markets of China, Brazil, India and Russia
will be driving the growth of aluminium consumption in 2011,""
RUSAL said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.	
 Prices for aluminium, used widely in the transport,
packaging and building sectors, should remain supported by
increasing demand for the metal as the global economy recovers,
analysts say.	
 The Russian firm , also listed in Paris, forecast
aluminium prices to continue to trade at the $2,500-2,600 level
throughout 2011. 
 RUSAL said it has dropped plans to issue yuan-denominated
bonds in the offshore market of Hong Kong as the cost of issuing
such bonds is higher than that of U.S. dollar or rouble bonds. 
 It is currently preparing to issue $500 million worth of
rouble bonds in April, the second tranche of a rouble bond issue
plan announced in February, Oleg Mukhamedshin, a deputy CEO of
RUSAL, told reporters at its results briefing.	
 ""At the moment we are not interested in borrowing in
renminbi (yuan). If you compare renminbi and U.S. dollars, the
current market seems a bit expensive for us,"" Mukhamedshin said,
adding, however that the firm might look at the possibility of
issuing yuan bonds when market conditions improve.	
 While the offshore renminbi market in Hong Kong has been
popular with issuers recently, analysts say the process for
remitting yuan funds into the mainland still remains an onerous
task and issuers still cannot do large deals, reducing the
market's attractiveness.	
 
 CHINA DEMAND TO GROW	
 RUSAL posted a net profit of $2.87 billion last year, up
from $821 million in 2009 and against an average forecast of
$1.96 billion from 10 analysts polled by Reuters. 
 For the fourth quarter, RUSAL made a profit of $1.45
billion, down from $1.65 billion for October-December 2009,
based on a Reuters calculation from the full-year data.	
 Higher aluminium prices lifted RUSAL's adjusted earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
in 2010 by 336 percent to $2.6 billion, largely in line with a
consensus $2.62 billion from 10 analysts polled by Reuters.	
 Demand in China, the world's largest producer and consumer
of aluminium, is expected to rise 12 percent this year, higher
than an estimated 8 percent increase in global consumption,
RUSAL said.	
 It said the average aluminium price on the London Metal
Exchange rose 30.3 percent last year from 2009 and the average
price of alumina, the key material for aluminium production,
also gained 36.5 last year.	
 However, rival Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (Chalco)
, which returned to the black in the fourth quarter,
cautioned earlier this month that the sector faced headwinds in
China from high costs and excess capacity. 
 RUSAL has said it planned to increase aluminium output by 2
percent in 2011 and lift alumina production by 8 percent.	
 Analysts said RUSAL's net income had been volatile because
of the impact from the revaluation of its 25 percent stake in
metals producer Norilsk Nickel . The market value of
RUSAL's stake in Norilsk Nickel increased by 66.8 percent in
2010 to $11.12 billion, the company said.	
 RUSAL's First Deputy CEO Vladislav Soloviev said the company
had no plans to invest in Glencore International AG's
initial public offering.	
Glencore, the world's largest commodities trader, is an
indirect shareholder of RUSAL. The trader is seeking to list on
the London and Hong Kong stock exchanges in an initial public
offering estimated at $10 billion.

cap its total output of rare earth oxides at 93,800 tonnes this

resources ministry said in a statement posted on its website on
Thursday.	
 The statement also said the ministry would not approve any
new prospecting or production licenses for rare earths, tungsten
or antimony until June 30, 2012. 
 Beijing has sought to impose more discipline on its chaotic
rare earths industry, but a series of policies aimed at cleaning
up the sector has alarmed foreign markets. 
 China produces 97 percent of global rare earth supplies,
giving it a stranglehold over a range of elements used in mobile
phone handsets and hybrid car batteries as well as wind turbines
and weapons guidance systems. 
 Beijing has already slashed export quotas by 35 percent for
the first half of 2011, and the decision has choked off global
supplies and driven prices up to record levels. [ID:nL3E7EO07X]	
 The country also plans to set up a strategic stockpile that
will give it more say over global prices. 
 It is also cracking down on an illegal rare earth export
market that amounted to as much as 10,000 tonnes of supply last
year, according to some estimates.	
 Chinese officials have said high levels of rare earth
production were not environmentally sustainable, and that China
also needed to retain supplies for domestic industries.

 Dai said the euro's global role should not be underestimated
despite the debt woes of some euro zone countries. The debt
crisis was caused not by the currency but by unfettered budget
deficits in some small countries, he argued.
 In the long run, the euro and a long-mooted Asian currency
unit should be the mainstay of the global monetary system, Dai
said.
 ""Because the Asian currency has yet to take shape, we should
let the renminbi play a bigger role,"" said Dai, now the head of
China's national pension fund.
 The Chinese yuan is also known as the renminbi.

 * U.S. stresses need for national action
(Recasts with new quotes, background)	
 By Daniel Flynn and Kevin Yao	
 NANJING, China, March 31 (Reuters) - China pushed back on
Thursday against pressure from Paris and Washington for swift
reform of a global monetary system that French President Nicolas
Sarkozy said is so unstable that it could tip the world economy
back into crisis.	
 The diverging views, on display at the start of a meeting of
the Group of 20 leading economies, underscored the difficulty
Sarkozy faces to meet his goal of drafting a blueprint for the
overhaul of the global monetary order by the end of the year.	
 ""Without rules, the international monetary and financial
system is incapable of forestalling crises, financial bubbles
and the widening of imbalances,"" Sarkozy told a gathering of
finance ministers, central bankers and prominent academics.	
 ""Without rules and supervision, the world runs the risk of
being condemned to increasingly serious and severe crises.""	
 France is the chairman this year of the G20, which brings
together developed and emerging economies accounting for some 85
percent of global output. 
 Beijing, despite being asked to host the forum, has not
shown great enthusiasm for the initiative or for Sarkozy's broad
plans for reform. China fears the thinly veiled aim is to force
it to let the yuan trade more freely and to dismantle its
capital controls more quickly than it wants to.	
 ""The reform process will be long-term and complex,"" Chinese
Vice-Premier said in his opening remarks. [ID:nB9E7EM00K]	
 
 TALKING SHOP	
 The meeting in the eastern city of Nanjing is billed as a
seminar to air ideas, not to take decisions.	
 In that spirit, Sarkozy asked whether it was not time to
broaden the Group of Seven industrial countries, one of whose
principal purposes is to police the global currency markets.	
 The group reasserted its role earlier this month when G7
central banks acted in concert to sell the yen. In doing so, it
reversed a surge in the currency that threatened to deepen the
damage to Japan's economy, already reeling from a devastating
earthquake on March 11.	
 A senior German official, who declined to be identified,
said Berlin was also in favour of currency questions being
addressed by a broader group than the G7, perhaps incorporating
the four BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China -- along
with Mexico.	
 But U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner questioned
whether an international effort was really needed to cure the
ills in the global monetary system. Inconsistency in exchange
rate policies was the biggest flaw, he said. [ID:nL3E7EV0FC]	
 Without naming China, he noted that some emerging countries
ran tightly managed currency regimes that fuelled inflation
risks in their own economies, magnified appreciation pressures
in others and also generated calls for protectionism.	
 ""This asymmetry in exchange rate policies creates a lot of
tension,"" Geithner said. ""This is the most important problem to
solve in the international monetary system today.""	
 But he said the solution was not complicated.	
 ""It does not require a new treaty, or a new institution. It
can be achieved by national actions to follow through on the
work we have already begun in the G20 to promote more balanced
growth and address excessive imbalances,"" he said.	
 
 AT OUR PACE	
 Wang, the Chinese vice-premier, said Beijing was indeed
taking steps to wean its economy off exports by boosting
domestic demand.	
 He was speaking shortly after the People's Bank of China,
the central bank, let the yuan rise to its strongest level yet
against the dollar since it allowed the Chinese currency to
resume climbing higher last June.	
 The yuan has gained more than 4 percent against the U.S.
currency in the interim, somewhat dampening U.S. complaints
about the way Beijing manages the currency.	
 But senior Chinese academics echoed Wang in stressing that
Beijing would change at a pace of its own choosing.	
 Reform of the global monetary system must be gradual and
China's priority is to avoid an abrupt fall in the dollar, said
Li Daokui, an academic adviser to the Chinese central bank who
is attending the seminar.	
 Sarkozy, who later left for Japan, floated the idea of
letting the International Monetary Fund (IMF) float bonds on the
global capital markets.	
 In his audience was the head of the IMF, Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, who is widely expected to run for president
against Sarkozy next year.	
 Sarkozy also suggested it was time to lay out a timetable
for emerging currencies like the yuan to become part of the
IMF's Special Drawing Right (SDR).	
 The SDR, a quasi-currency used as the Fund's unit of
account, is currently composed of the dollar, euro, yen and
sterling.	
 Economists say that adding the yuan to the basket would make
it more representative and credible and could set the stage for
the SDR to play a greater role as an international reserve asset
in future, thus giving countries an alternative to accumulating
huge reserves of dollars.	
 Although China regularly voices criticism of U.S monetary
policies and the dominance of the dollar, it has acted
cautiously as France has ratcheted up the calls for global
monetary reform.	
 In talks with Sarkozy on Wednesday, Chinese President Hu
Jintao said only that his government was willing to ""strengthen
communication and coordination"" with France ahead of the main
G20 summit later in November.	
 Beijing's caution stems, in large part, from being the
country with the most to lose should the dollar suddenly lose
its status as the anchor of the global economy.	
 China has the world's biggest pile of foreign reserves,
$2.85 trillion and rising, and about two-thirds are estimated to
be held in dollar-denominated assets.

 * Calls for stronger IMF to highlight monetary risks
 * Says U.S. is working to stabilise its debt level
(Adds details, background)	
 NANJING, China, March 31 (Reuters) - Tightly controlled
exchange rate regimes are the main flaw in the international
monetary system and the solution is simple, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner told a G20 meeting on Thursday.	
 In a thinly veiled swipe at the Chinese hosts of the seminar
of the Group of 20 wealthy and developing economies, Geithner
said that countries should have flexible exchange rates and
permit free flows of capital to be major players in the global
currency order.	
 He also used his speech to call for a stronger International
Monetary Fund and to defend U.S. policies, acknowledging that
past failures had caused much damage but saying the government
was aiming to stabilise debt levels to avoid future problems.	
 The G20 seminar was spear-headed by France, which is pushing
a bold reform agenda in its year-long presidency of the group,
and was meant to be focused on ills in the monetary system.	
 Geithner offered a straightforward diagnosis. While major
currencies moved freely and most emerging economies were well
along that path, there were still some with little exchange rate
flexibility and extensive capital controls, he said.	
 This asymmetry fuelled inflation risks in the economies
whose exchange rates are undervalued, magnified currency
appreciation in others and also generated protectionist
pressures, he added.	
 ""This is the most important problem to solve in the
international monetary system today. But it is not a
complicated problem to solve,"" he said, according to the
prepared text of his remarks.	
 ""It does not require a new treaty, or a new institution. It
can be achieved by national actions,"" he added.	
 Although Geithner did not mention China by name, the United
States has long called on Beijing to let its currency rise more
quickly, accusing it of keeping its exchange rate artificially
cheap to give its exporters an unfair advantage.	
 In recent months, Geithner has taken to casting the Chinese
currency as a broader global problem, saying that it is making
life difficult for other developing economies. India and Brazil,
among others, have agreed, saying that a cheap yuan has
undermined their competitiveness.	
 The Chinese government told countries attending the G20
seminar in the eastern city of Nanjing not to mention specific
currencies in their speeches and to keep their focus on broader
questions in the global monetary system, according to a source
attending the meeting.	
 
 PLAN FOR CHANGE	
 While saying that national governments held the key to
reform in their own hands, Geithner called for a stronger
International Monetary Fund to shine a spotlight on risks.	
 ""We would also support giving the IMF a greater capacity to
help influence the policy choices made by the major economies,
including greater independence to publish its analysis,"" he
said.	
 The IMF should be able to make recommendations for how to
preempt the emergence of large imbalances in the global economy,
he said.	
 On the Special Drawing Right (SDR), the IMF's unit account
that France and China believe should take on a bigger role in
the international monetary system, Geithner was clear.	
 Both French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese officials
have said it is time to consider bringing the yuan into the
basket of currencies that constitutes the SDR, which is
currently restricted to the dollar, euro, yen and pound.
Geithner suggested that certain conditions should be met first.	
 ""We believe that currencies of large economies heavily used
in international trade and financial transactions should become
part of the SDR basket, and that to achieve this objective, the
concerned countries should have flexible exchange rate systems,
independent central banks, and permit the free movement of
capital flows,"" he said.	
 Emphasising that solutions to the global monetary system's
problems rest at the national level, Geithner said the United
States had made progress in fixing the policy mistakes that
caused damage in the global financial crisis but still had work
to do.	
 ""We are committed to ... fiscal reforms that will reduce
deficits as a share of the economy to three percent over the
next several years so that we stabilize the ratio of debt to GDP
at a level that will not threaten future economic growth,"" he
said.

out a bold agenda, China warning that change must be gradual and

 CAUTIOUS CHINA	
 Although China regularly voices criticism of U.S monetary

cautiously as France has ratcheted up the calls for global
monetary reform.	
 In Hu Jintao's talks with Sarkozy on Wednesday, the Chinese
leader said only that his government was willing to ""strengthen

G20 summit later this year.	
 The Chinese government has also emphasised that France is
the organiser of the Nanjing seminar and China simply the venue.
It has insisted that a small think tank headed by a retired
vice-premier is responsible for the Chinese side of the
planning.

 By Richard Leong	
 HONG KONG, March 31 (Reuters) - Asian stocks advanced on
Thursday, heading for a quarterly gain despite a sharp sell-off
earlier this month after disaster struck Japan, while the yen
was poised for a quarterly loss on expectations Tokyo will have
to maintain super-loose monetary policy far longer than Europe
and the United States.	
 Concerns about the impact on high oil and food prices on
global growth and central bank moves to curb inflation have
overtaken worries about Japan's nuclear crisis and unrest in the
Middle East. This has caused some analysts to remain cautious
even on investments in faster-growing Asian markets.	
 ""Most of the Asian economies will grow more moderately than
last year. They are encountering more hurdles like inflation and
controls in capital flows. This could create some disincentives
to invest in Asia broadly. You have to invest in selective
markets"" said Thomas Lam, group chief economist at OSK-DMG in
Singapore.	
 Lam cited Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore as likely better
performers than Hong Kong and Thailand. 
 Still analysts predict emerging Asian markets will on
average fare than developed ones this year. 
 MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.5 percent on the day, putting it on track
for a 4.7 percent gain in March despite a sharp downward spike
following the massive earthquake and tsunami which hit Japan on
March 11, severely damaging a nuclear power plant and knocking
many factories offline. 
 For the year to date, the Asia ex-Japan index has gained 1.2
percent.	
 By comparison, the MSCI world index dipped
0.2 percent in March, but has gained around 4 percent so far in
2011. Relative weakness in Asia was offset by strong gains early
in the year in major U.S. and European indexes as investors
rotated from emerging markets to large, developed ones.	
 The U.S. S&P 500 index has risen 6.3 percent so far
this year and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading
European shares has managed a 1.2 percent rise.	
 
 EMERGING VS DEVELOPED MARKETS	
 A key investment decision for Asian stock investors in the
coming months will likely be whether to pile bets on China and
the faster-growing economies in Asia over safer but
lower-returning investments in developed economies, analysts
said.	
 Gross domestic product of emerging markets will on average
expand 6.0 percent in 2011 and 2012, more than double those of
developed markets, according to JPMorgan economists.	
 In Asia, Japan is expected to lag its neighbors as the
world's No. 3 economy faces huge rebuilding cost from the twin
disasters this month and the still unknown toll from the damaged
nuclear plant, which is still leaking radiation.	
 The yen has declined to the lowest since May 2010 against
the euro in the wake of recent hawkish comments by euro zone
officials signalling interest rate hikes, and has slid against
the dollar as well after U.S. central bank officials indicated
the economy may now be strong enough that it no longer needs
further stimulus. 
 On the last day of Japan's fiscal year, the Nikkei index
was up nearly 0.5 percent late in a choppy session. So
far in March, it has shed 8.3 percent, heading for its worst
month since May 2010. Year to date, the benchmark has fallen
around 5 percent. 


 WEAKER YEN BOOSTS EXPORTERS' SHARES	
 The weaker yen is expected to boost the demand for Japanese
goods in overseas markets, though investors remain concerned
about the impact of power shortages on Japanese manufacturers
following the disasters.	
 It is also seen as a cheap way to fund higher-yielding
assets such as the Australian dollar which reached a 10-month
high against the yen and a 29-year high against the
U.S. dollar in early trading.	
 But the yen on Thursday pulled back from its earlier lows,
trading flat to slightly higher against major currencies.	
 The dollar was last at 82.74 yen , up 9 percent from
its record low of 76.25 yen on March 17 before G7 central banks
intervened in a rare coordinated move to stem the yen's rise.	
 The euro last traded at 117.11 yen. It had risen high as
117.54 yen earlier , its highest since May 2010,
bringing its gains this year to 8 percent.	
 Concerns over Japan's nuclear crisis, conflicts in the Libya
and nagging fiscal problems in Europe have eased, for now, with
expectations that stocks worldwide will move higher into the new
quarter on an improving economic outlook, analysts said. 
 
 Gold rebounded from initial losses tied to profit-taking. It
snapped a four-session losing streak on Wednesday. For the
quarter, gold as well as bonds generated small returns.	
 Barclays Capital's global aggregate bond index has risen
1.05 percent so far this year. 
 Spot gold traded at $1,426.86 an ounce, compared with
$1,423.38 late in New York on Wednesday. It has been running 2
percent below the record of $1,447.40 set on March 24. 
 U.S. oil prices rose after falling on Wednesday on data
showing ample inventory in the United States, the world's
biggest energy consumer. This offset worries over supply
disruption from the turmoil in Libya and the Middle East.	
 U.S. crude  was up 41 cents to $104.68 a barrel, while
Brent crude  advanced 42 cents to $115.55, posting more
than a 24 percent increase so far this year.

 By Chizu Nomiyama and Yoko Kubota 
 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy
called on Thursday for the creation of new global nuclear
regulations by the end of 2011 during a first visit by a foreign
leader to Japan since the earthquake and tsunami that triggered
its atomic disaster.	
 Group of 20 chairman Sarkozy said France wanted to host a
meeting of the bloc's nuclear officials in May to fix new norms
in the wake of the crisis at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant.	
 ""We must address this anomaly that there are no
international safety norms for nuclear matters,"" he said.	
 The world's worst atomic crisis since Chernobyl in 1986 is
proving hard to contain and has forced an international rethink
on the benefits and safety of nuclear power. 
 U.N. body the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sets
standards and recommendations, but they are not legally binding
and safety is primarily the responsibility of member states.	
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan backed the French proposal
for a global nuclear review. ""In order to avoid recurrence of
such an accident, it is our duty to accurately share with the
world our experience,"" Kan said at a joint news conference. 
 The nuclear drama at the Fukushima Daiichi plant has piled
on the agony for Japan after the quake and tsunami left nearly
28,000 people dead or missing and caused damage that may top
$300 billion. 
 First data on the economic impact of the March 11 disaster
showed manufacturing suffered its biggest drop on record this
month as factories shut and supply chains were disrupted,
especially in the car and technology sectors for which Japan is
renowned.	
 
 France, the world's most nuclear-dependent country, is
taking a lead in assisting Japan.	
 ""Dear Japanese friends, know that in this appalling
catastrophe, the world is watching and admiring you,"" Sarkozy
said during his visit to Tokyo.	
 As well as his show of solidarity by his personal
presence, Paris has flown in experts from state-owned nuclear
reactor maker Areva .	
 ""Consider me your employee,"" Areva Chief Executive Anne
Lauvergeon told Japanese officials. 
 The United States and Germany have weighed in too, offering
robots to help repair the damaged nuclear plant. 
 In an alarming development in Switzerland, a parcel bomb
exploded in the offices of the national nuclear lobby, injuring
two female employees. It was not known who sent it.	
 Switzerland has frozen he approvals process for three new
nuclear stations pending a safety review after Japan's disaster.	
 Pressure has been growing on Japan to expand the evacuation
zone around the Fukushima Daiichi plant where radiation hit
4,000 times the legal limit in the sea nearby and hindered the
battle to contain the crisis.	
 Both the U.N. nuclear watchdog and Japan's own nuclear
safety agency have advised Kan to consider widening the 20-km
(12-mile) zone round the plant on the northeast Pacific coast.	
 High radiation was detected twice that distance away. 
 Government officials are pleading for Japanese, and the
world, to avoid overreacting to what they say are still low-risk
levels of radiation away from the plant. 
 
 EVACUATION CONTROVERSY	
 More than 70,000 people have been evacuated from the 20-km
ring. Another 136,000 who live in a 10-km (6-mile) band beyond
that have been encouraged to leave or to stay indoors.	
 The IAEA, said radiation at Iitate village, 40 km (25 miles)
from the plant, exceeded a criterion for evacuation. 
 Consistently high levels of radiation found in the sea near
the complex could mean radiation is leaking out continuously,
Japan's nuclear watchdog said. The source is still unknown,
adding to the headaches for engineers on the site. 
 Radioactive iodine in seawater near drains running from the
plant was 4,385 times more than the legal limit, the highest
recorded so far during the crisis.	
 In a sign of the extraordinary times Japan is living, one
newborn baby's first medical appointment was not with a
paediatrician but a Geiger counter. 
 ""I am so scared about radiation,"" Misato Nagashima said as
she took her baby Rio, born four days after the earthquake and
disaster, for a screening at a city in Fukushima prefecture. 
 Concern over radiation beyond Japan grew further after
Singapore detected radiation nine times the limit in cabbages
from Japan, while the United States reported ""minuscule"" levels
of radiation in milk samples on its west coast.	
 Several countries have banned milk and produce from areas
near the damaged nuclear plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of
Tokyo. Japan has itself stopped exports of vegetables and milk
from there.	
 Contaminated milk was one of the biggest causes of thyroid
cancer after the 1986 nuclear accident in Chernobyl because
people near the plant kept drinking milk from local cows.	
 
 LENGTHY BATTLE	
 Experts say the battle to control Fukushima's six reactors
could take weeks, if not months, followed by a clean-up
operation that may drag on for years. 
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co could face
compensation claims of up to 11 trillion yen ($133 billion) --
nearly four times its equity -- if the nuclear crisis drags on
for two years, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.	
 Experts said the continued lack of a permanent cooling
system was hindering efforts to stop fuel rods overheating.	
 Workers have been forced to pump in seawater to cool the
rods, but this in turn creates contaminated water flows.	
 Radiation readings around the evacuation zone vary widely.	
 Daily readings published by the government show that 30 km
(19 miles) northwest of the reactors levels are climbing up to
42 microsieverts per hour, about six times the cosmic radiation
experienced during a Tokyo-New York flight.	
 Elsewhere at that distance around the reactor it is just
1.0-1.2 microsieverts per hour.	
 A Reuters reading in downtown Tokyo on Thursday showed a
radiation level of 0.18 microsieverts per hour. This is still
quite low by global standards as Japan has lower levels of

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - The yen slipped across the board
on Thursday, hitting fresh 10-month lows versus the euro and
holding near a three-week trough against the dollar as
expectations grew that Japan will lag euro zone and U.S. Central
banks in raising interest rates.	
 Strong U.S. private jobs data and hawkish comments by euro
zone and U.S. central bank officials reinforced the view that
the global economic recovery is on track, leading to stronger
risk-taking by investors as the volatile first quarter ends.	
 Anticipation that Japan would buck the global tightening
cycle to leave yen rates low to support its quake-hit economy is
encouraging players to sell the currency to fund higher-yielding
investments, in a revival of the carry trade that flourished
before the credit crisis began in 2007.	
 ""Interest rate differentials are the strongest driver of the
market. The Fed is starting to communicate to the market that
QE2 is ending in June. The focus is now moving to the exit of
the strategy,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst at Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 ""Looking at flows, players are buying fresh dollar/yen
positions instead of covering shorts. Weakness of the yen
against the crosses may be reflecting moves by Japanese retail
investors.""	
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent on the day at 83.12 yen
, up 9 percent from its record low of 76.25 yen set on
March 17 before G7 central banks intervened in a rare
coordinated move to stem the yen's rise.	
 The dollar's immediate resistance is seen at 83.30, the
March 11 high, before 83.99-84.51 November-February range highs.	
 Top Federal Reserve officials said on Wednesday the central
bank needs to exit its $600 billion bond buying plan, adding to
expectations that it is nearing the end of its current round of
stimulus. [ID:nN30180403]	
 The spread between the two-year U.S. and Japanese government
bond yields widened to 62 basis points
this week, compared with just 33 two weeks ago.	
 The euro rose as high as 117.46 yen , its highest
since May 2010, bringing its gains this year to 8 percent.	
 The euro was steady at $1.4123 , facing resistance at
$1.422 and $1.4248. BNP Paribas is recommending long euro
positions from $1.4120 to target $1.45 with a stop at $1.402.	
 In a sign that investors are increasingly confident about
taking risks, the Volatility Index or VIX -- Wall
Street's favorite gauge of investor fear -- fell to 17.71, its
lowest level since Feb. 18. 
 
 EURO'S CHALLENGES	
 European Central Bank executive board member Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi said on Thursday the central bank's policy is to
gradually raise interest rates, while another board member,
Juergen Stark, said rates are exceptionally low, cementing
expectations for an April interest rate hike .	
 ""The barrage of ECB commentary shows a CB wanting to keep
liquidity operations separate from rate policy; the agenda has
already moved on to how hawkish Mr. (ECB President Jean-Claude)
Trichet will sound at the April 7 press conference,"" BNP Paribas
said in a note to clients.	
 Three-month euro interbank lending rates rose as high as
1.213 percent , a level not seen since June 2009. 
 However, Credit Agricole said the euro may struggle to
advance further against the dollar given that the euro zone rate
outlook is largely priced in. 
 The bank said correlations between euro/dollar and
three-month eurozone-U.S. interest rates spread stand at 0.95 --
a number that shows an extremely close relationship.	
 Investors are also nervous about the risk that the euro zone
debt crisis may spread to other peripheral countries. 
 Ireland will announce the results of stress tests later on
Thursday that are expected to signal the effective
nationalisation of the entire financial system. [ID:nLDE72T086]

 NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world
markets rose on Wednesday as data showing strong hiring by U.S.
private employers provided a boost, while the euro gained
against the U.S. dollar on remarks by a European policymaker
indicating higher eurozone interest rates ahead.
 U.S. stocks ended higher, with activity dominated by money
managers buying recent winners, including energy and
small-caps, as the quarter nears its end. But volume remained
thin and the S&P 500 index failed to hold above the key 1,330
level.
 ""A lot of what you're seeing for the entire week is
everybody wanting to be either in or out of whatever they want
to show their clients for quarter-end,"" said Neal Dietz,
managing director at Dietz & Lynch Capital in Newburyport,
Massachusetts.
 A report by ADP that U.S. private sector businesses added
201,000 jobs in March buoyed expectations about the pace of
economic recovery in the United States, the world's largest
economy, and gave stocks on Wall Street an early boost.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained
more than 1.0 percent while European shares hit a three-week
closing high.
 EURO JUMPS
 In currency markets, the euro hit a 10-week high against
the yen. It also rose against the dollar, erasing early losses,
after European Central Bank policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi
said the ECB intends to raise rates gradually, suggesting next
week's expected hike may be the first of several. For more,
see: [ID:nLDE72T1ZS]
 The euro hit $1.4147  and was last at $1.4128,
after falling as low as $1.4049 earlier.
 The Australian dollar rallied too, surging to levels last
seen in the early 1980s.
 The Japanese yen slipped to a 10-month low versus the euro
and a near three-month low against the dollar as recent hawkish
comments from euro zone and U.S. officials on interest rates
contrasted with Japan's loose monetary policy stance.
 The yen fell against the euro to 117.28 yen, and against
the U.S. dollar it fell to 83.19 yen .
 Rising risk appetite encouraged investors to seek
higher-yielding assets, with the Australian dollar ,
climbing to a 29-year high over the U.S. dollar and a 10-month
high against the yen.

 The ADP report on U.S. private sector jobs -- showing

non-farm payrolls. While it indicated the economy is on the
mend, the job numbers themselves were not overly bullish.

Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin.
 COMMODITIES DOWN
 U.S. crude oil  settled down 52 cents, or half a

of supply due to unrest in Libya and the Middle East. [O/R]
 Copper, an industrial metal seen as an economic bellwether,
fell almost 2 percent as investors worried about lack of demand

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - The United States and
Colombia are moving toward an agreement in talks on anti-union
violence in Colombia that has blocked approval of a free trade
deal, the top U.S. trade official said on Wednesday.
 ""We're making very good progress,"" U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk told the Reuters Latin American Summit.
""We're very encouraged with what we've heard from the
Colombians thus far.""
 During his recent trip to South America, President Barack
Obama reaffirmed his commitment to resolve issues blocking the
trade deal with Colombia and another with Panama in order ""to
present them to Congress this year,"" Kirk said.
 The administration of former President George W. Bush
negotiated the trade deal with Colombia, which the countries
signed in November 2006.
 But Democrats, who won control of Congress in elections the
same month, objected strongly to the pact on the grounds that
then-President Alvaro Uribe had not taken strong enough steps
to protect workers rights and killings of union leaders by
paramilitaries and other right-wing groups.
 ""We did believe it was important that we address the
continued concern ... over what many believe is targeted
violence against labor leaders and the absence of any real
mechanism to protect their basic rights and hold accountable
those who have perpetrated that violence,"" Kirk said.
 ""We think we have a unique opportunity with the carrot of
the FTA to work with Colombia to do some things that they might
otherwise undertake to do over the next several years,"" he
added.
 The former Dallas mayor and friend of Obama declined to
provide detail on what steps the two countries were discussing
to address the concerns or to give an estimate of how much
longer it would take to finish discussions.
 But he said an agreement could include U.S. technical
assistance to help Colombia strengthen its labor ministry and
enforcement of labor laws.
 ""I think we would welcome the opportunity to share our
expertise. But we want it to be something the Colombians would
welcome, rather than see as forced upon them,"" Kirk said.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 10-month high
against the yen and rose against the dollar on Wednesday as
markets braced for higher euro zone interest rates, while the
Australian dollar hit levels last seen in the early 1980s.
 The euro erased losses against the U.S. currency after a
European Central Bank policymaker said the ECB intends to raise
rates gradually, which traders said suggests next week's
expected hike may be the first of several.
 The prospect of higher euro zone borrowing costs bolstered
hopes the world economy was improving and encouraged investors
to take on more risk, a trend that looks set to carry the euro
higher in coming weeks and continue to hurt the yen.
 The euro in particular has shown exceptional staying power.
It is up 5 percent against the dollar in 2011 despite lingering
fiscal problems in several euro zone states, prompting some
traders to refer to it as the ""Teflon euro.""
 Wednesday's remarks from the ECB's Lorenzo Bini Smaghi
should help the currency extend gains, as they ""hint that a
series of rate hikes may be coming this year,"" said Brian
Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com.
 The euro's move above its 200-hour moving average around
$1.4125 suggests a renewed uptrend, and a break of $1.4250
would make a rally to $1.44-45 likely, Dolan said.
 The euro hit $1.4147 and was last at $1.4128, well off a
$1.4049 session low. It was also trading at 117.12 yen, just
below its highest level since May 2010.
 ""I would be confident in the euro at these levels,"" said
Pierre Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors.
""I like the euro, basically, and I see some upside.""
 The dollar rose to around 83.19 yen, a level last seen on
March 11, when the yen initially fell after Japan's earthquake.
It last traded at 82.89 yen, up 0.5 percent.
 Traders reported offers from 83.30-50, with orders said to
be thin until more supply placed at around 84.00.
 REVIVING THE CARRY TRADE
 The dollar hit a record near 76 yen this month when an
earthquake in Japan fed speculation the diaster would force
Japanese investors to bring money home from abroad.
 Japanese intervention stopped runaway yen gains and rising
U.S. Treasury yields have since carried the dollar higher.
Remarks from some Federal Reserve officials about the need to
tighten U.S. monetary policy may have contributed to the rise.
 Yield differentials are key to the revival of the ""carry
trade,"" in which investors borrow in low-yielding, low-risk
currencies such as the yen to fund more lucrative trades.
 ""You can see the euro/yen relationship indicating that yen
carry trade is being put back into play,"" said Paul Mendelsohn,
chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte, Vermont.
 AUSSIE SHINES
 Investors also snapped up the high-yielding Australian
dollar, which rose to $1.0338, its highest level since it was
first floated in the early 1980s. It also hit a 10-month high
against the yen.
 Scotia Capital strategist Camilla Sutton said repatriation
flows into Japan may yet materialize, which could help push the
yen higher, at least against the dollar.
 Faros Trading analyst Dan Dorrow said the Aussie dollar's
recent highs are no reason to sell it. The market, he said, is
overestimating the chances of tighter U.S. monetary policy and
underestimating chances that the Reserve Bank of Australia
could still lift interest rates from 4.75 percent.
 ""While domestic weaknesses may keep the RBA on hold for
awhile, risks are for an upside surprise,"" he said.

 * Adviser: business cooperation a must for tax, trade deals
(Adds context, background)
 WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate tax reform
could be accomplished this year if agreement can be reached
among businesses and policymakers on simplifying the tax code
and devoting the savings to cutting rates, said a senior Obama
administration economic adviser on Wednesday.
 ""If we can come together. we have a chance to do something
very significant this year with this Congress and with this
president,"" said Gene Sperling, director of the National
Economic Council, at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event.
 He cautioned, however, that agreement will not happen
without cooperation from business.
 ""This is not going to happen if the attitude of each
company or business is simply to go to one's accountant and
figure out if you are a winner or loser in the particular year
that the bill is passed,"" he said.
 President Barack Obama has said he wants to trim the U.S.
corporate tax rate, now at 35 percent, among the highest in the
industrialized world. Most companies pay far less, with
deductions and credits that are not evenly spread across the
business community.
 Most observers believe the chances are low that a deal on
revamping corporate taxes will happen before the 2012
presidential election, given the inevitable winners and losers
that would result from such an overhaul.
 Sperling added that the administration is working on
winning congressional approval for free trade agreements,
particularly with Colombia.
 Like corporate tax reform, Sperling said he sees trade as
an area of common ground with the business community.
 ""We're very committed to moving forward on the trade
agenda,"" he said. ""As we speak, we are working very hard to
resolve the outstanding issues in the Colombia free trade
agreement.""
 The administration is working to get Congress to pass trade
deals with Colombia, Panama and South Korea.

 * Unclear if EU prepared to quickly lift shipping curbs
 * Cocoa stocks brimming at dockside warehouses
 
 By Loucoumane Coulibaly
 ABIDJAN, March 30 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast cocoa farmers and traders are hopeful a dramatic
sweep south by the country's former rebel fighters could soon pave the way for a partial
resumption of cocoa exports.
 Output from the world's top cocoa grower has been blocked since late January after a
dispute over who won the West African country's presidential election triggered an export ban
and EU restrictions on shipping at its ports.
 More than 1 million tonnes of cocoa have reached Ivorian ports since the current season
began in October, but at least 450,000 tonnes of that is believed to be languishing in
warehouses at the dock side, at risk of rotting.
 The dispute has broken into open conflict between the country's former rebels, now loyal
to internationally backed presidential claimant Alassane Ouattara, and the national army
supporting incumbent Laurent Gbagbo.
 The United Nations, Western nations and African states have recognised Ouattara as the
poll's legitimate winner.
 A dramatic offensive in recent days by Ouattara forces has put them within 130 km (80.78
miles) of the coastal town of San Pedro, home to Ivory Coast's second biggest export port, and
within striking distance of the commercial capital Abidjan.
 ""If (Ouattara's) forces capture the port of San Pedro, we believe that exports of beans
that were previously blocked will resume,"" said a purchases manager for a major export
company, who asked not to be named.
 ""There will be a sigh of relief because we'll be able to work again. We would not hesitate
to pay taxes to the Ouattara government,"" he added.
 Other exporters said if San Pedro, where more than a third of Ivorian cocoa is shipped,
were to fall to Ouattara forces there would likely be some delay to a restart in exports
pending a structure to pay taxes to the Ouattara government and arrangements by traders for
the arrival of ships.
 The European Union imposed restrictions on EU vessels operating at Ivorian ports in
January in an effort to squeeze Gbagbo, days after Ouattara declared a ban on cocoa exports
for the same reason.
 EU officials were not immediately available to comment on whether the shipping
restrictions would be amended if San Pedro came under Ouattara's control.
 Cocoa futures fell to the lowest point in over two months on Wednesday as gains by
pro-Ouattara forces increased prospects for an end to the crisis.
 ""Whether there will be a rapid opening of the captured ports to cocoa exports is still
being doubted but it certainly seems possible,"" one cash trader said.
 ""Rapid exports would probably require a scaling-back of EU sanctions and the EU is not
well known for making very quick decisions on matters like this.""
 Ivory Coast produces about 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa per year, or about a third of
global supply.
 Farmers have complained the export halt has decimated buying interest, leading farmgate
prices to dive and growers to leave ripe beans unharvested as they pursue subsistence crops on
spare land to feed their families.
 ""If the capture of the port of San Pedro will allow exporters to start buying from us
again, that would be good news for us. All of the farmers are tired and can't wait for buying
to start again,"" said farmer Salam Kone in Soubre.
 Industry players noted any fighting in Abidjan, a Gbagbo stronghold, would be more likely
to be protracted with exports there remaining at a standstill.
 Moving beans from Abidjan warehouses to San Pedro for shipment in the meantime would be
difficult.
 ""Gbagbo's camp would try to prevent that,"" said a buyer from a European exporter.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - World stocks rose more than
1 percent on Wednesday as strong hiring by U.S. private
employers boosted both U.S. and European markets, while the
euro rose against the dollar after remarks by a European policy
maker.
 A report by ADP that U.S. private employers added 201,000
jobs in March buoyed expectations over the pace of economic
recovery in the United States, the world's largest economy.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained
more than 1.0 percent while European shares hit a three-week
closing high, and U.S. shares rose.
 In currency markets, the euro turned higher against the
dollar after European Central Bank executive board member,
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, said the bank's policy is to gradually
raise interest rates.
 The euro rose to the day's highs at $1.4148  on
electronic trading platform EBS. It was last at $1.4138, up 0.2
percent, after falling as low as $1.4052 earlier.
 Bini Smaghi's comments suggested that ""a series of rate
hikes may be coming this year,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com.
 The Japanese yen slipped to a 10-month low versus the euro
and a near three-month low against the dollar as recent hawkish
comments from euro zone and U.S. officials on interest rates
contrasted with Japan's loose monetary policy stance.
The yen fell against the euro to 117.28 yen. Against the
U.S. dollar, the yen fell to 83.19 yen .
 Rising risk appetite encouraged investors to seek
higher-yielding assets, with the Australian dollar ,
climbing to a 29-year high over the U.S. dollar and a 10-month
high against the yen.

 * Yen falls broadly, EUR/JPY hits 10-month high
 * Market focus on rate differentials
 * Asset managers go tentatively long carry trades
(Recasts, updates prices, adds detail, comment)
 NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - The yen weakened across the
board on Wednesday, sliding to a 10-month low against the euro,
as recent hawkish comments from euro zone and U.S. officials
contrasted with Japan's loose monetary policy.
 The euro rose to around 117.28 yen  on
electronic trading platform EBS, its strongest since May 2010,
and was seen climbing more on expectations the European Central
Bank will start raising interest rates as early as next month.
 Rising risk appetite encouraged investors to seek
higher-yielding assets, with the Australian dollar climbing to
a 29-year high over its U.S. counterpart  and a
10-month high against the yen. 
 ""The new high in the Australian dollar, combined with
weakness in yen, suggest that the carry trade is building
momentum,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""This could put significant
weakening pressure on yen, but we would not be surprised to see
some dollar/yen downside (yen strength) on the back of ongoing
repatriation in late in April.""
 The U.S. dollar rose to around 83.19 yen , a level
last seen on March 11, when the yen initially fell after
Japan's earthquake. It last traded at 82.98 yen, up 0.6
percent.
 Traders reported offers at 83.30/50, with orders said to be
thin until more supply placed at around 84.00.
 Hawkish comments in recent days from U.S. Federal Reserve
and European Central Bank officials contrasted with the stance
taken by the Bank of Japan, which is set to leave interest
rates near zero for some time to support the world's
third-largest economy as it recovers from the effects of the
earthquake.
 Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said on Tuesday he
would vote against further monetary easing after the Federal
Reserve's $600 billion bond-buying program ends in June.
[ID:nN2984973]
 That pushed up short-dated U.S. Treasury yields, widening
their differential with Japanese yields as investors took the
comments as an indication of eventual monetary tightening.
 Those yield differentials are key to the revival of the
""carry trade,"" in which investors borrow in low-yielding,
low-risk currencies such as the yen and buy riskier assets
elsewhere. The yen has also become a prime funding vehicle
because of large injections of cash by the Bank of Japan into
the Japanese economy after the recent earthquake and tsunami.
 ""You can see the euro/yen relationship indicating that yen
carry trade is being put back into play,"" said Paul Mendelsohn,
chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte, Vermont.
 The euro  was down 0.1 percent on the day at $1.4097
but up 0.5 percent against the yen at 116.95 yen 
on electronic trading platform EBS.
 The euro is more than 5.0 percent higher against the dollar
this year, and its apparent resilience to fiscal problems
facing weak euro zone countries has led some to nickname it the
""Teflon euro.""
 ""I would be confident in the euro at these levels,"" said
Pierre Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors.
""I like the euro, basically, and I see some upside.""
 AUSSIE SHINES
 Speculation that Japanese investors may reduce dollar
hedging positions related to their overseas investments, and
the absence of huge repatriation flows following the quake, are
shifting the focus back to economic fundamentals and
reinforcing the yen's status as a funding currency.
 ""We're seeing asset managers and hedge funds starting to
dip their toes back into carry trades, but it's quite tentative
at this stage,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS,
in an interview with Reuters Insider.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2011 12:04PM ET</span>",Global trade seen limiting food price volatility," * EU, World bank economists say trade can limit price shocks
 * Export restrictions a key contributor to price volatility
 
 BRUSSELS, March 30 (Reuters) - Increased global trade in
agricultural commodities can help to limit world food price
volatility, while trade restrictions help to fuel it, economists
from the World Bank and European Union said on Wednesday.
 France is seeking greater international coordination to
limit unilateral trade restrictions during its presidency of the
G20 group of major economies this year, after Russia's ban on
grain exports this summer sent world prices soaring.
 ""In our view, higher volumes of trade can help to mitigate
volatility,"" said Willi Schulz-Greve, head of the economic
analysis unit in the European Commission's agriculture
department.
 ""Export restrictions on the other hand would increase
volatility, and that's why there's a strong focus in the G20 and
international discussions to get away from these kinds of
instruments,"" he said at a seminar on food security in Brussels.
 Will Martin, an agricultural economist at the World Bank,
said he understood why countries often sought to insulate
themselves from price rises through export restrictions.
 ""The problem is if all countries attempted to insulate
themselves from all price rises, the world price just goes up
more. It's completely ineffective,"" he said.
 ""It's very similar to the situation you get when everyone in
the crowd of a grandstand stands up to get a better view -- it's
clearly ineffective,"" he added.
 Martin said he and his colleagues had recently published a
study showing that 45 percent of the increase in rice prices in
2008 was due to measures taken by countries trying to insulate
themselves from the rising cost of the food staple.
 The answer, according to Martin, is to secure a rules-based
agreement to liberalise global trade.
 But with an agreement to prohibit export bans altogether
seemingly unlikely, some -- including the head of the World
Trade Organization -- say humanitarian aid should be made exempt
from export embargoes, in order to limit the impact on the
world's poorest populations.

 By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, March 30 (Reuters) - Central banks around the
world are struggling to regain their inflation-fighting
credibility in the face of high commodity prices, but the Bank
of Israel may have succeeded -- for now at least -- with an
aggressive interest rate hike.
 Israel's central bank on Monday raised its benchmark lending
rate by a larger-than-expected half a percentage point to 3.0
percent. Virtually all analysts had predicted a third straight
quarter-point move from the bank's governor Stanley Fischer.
 ""The bravest central banker in the world"", read a headline
in the Haaretz newspaper.
 Haaretz columnist Eytal Avriel wrote on Tuesday that Fischer
was not the only central banker facing a terrible dilemma
between supporting economic growth and keeping a lid on
inflation and asset bubbles -- but that he might be more
effective than most.
 ""Many will think Fischer is crazy. But Fischer is simply
doing his job properly, uncompromisingly, ignoring political
pressure,"" Avriel said.
 ""Other central bank governors are the crazy ones. They are
keeping interest rates too low and sacrificing the medium and
long term for the short term.""
 In its rate hike statement, the central bank cited a high
inflation environment of more than 4 percent and expanding
economic activity; the economy grew an annualised 7.7 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2010. [ID:nLDE72R1Z6]
 ""The pre-emptive move to hike rates more than expected will
be conducive for restoring the Bank of Israel's credibility,""
said Kubilay Ozturk, an economist at Deutsche Bank.
 ""This will also send a good signal to the markets that
inflationary expectations will not remain unanchored.""
 
 PRESSURE
 Before the latest rate increase, the Bank of Israel had
already boosted its key rate eight times since August 2009 from
a low of 0.5 percent. But as consumer prices started to rise
rapidly in the past few months, repeatedly topping analysts'
monthly forecasts, many investors believed policymakers were
losing the battle with inflation.
 Despite the rate hikes, the benchmark 10-year government
bond yield  rose 30 basis points over the past
month, peaking at 5.35 percent on Monday just before the latest
rate move. In all, the yield -- a barometer for the inflation
outlook -- jumped some 70 bps since the beginning of the year.
 That trend was at least temporarily reversed on Tuesday,
when the 10-year yield slipped to 5.33 percent, while short-term
yields rose to reflect expectations for more rate hikes this
year. Most analysts and the Bank of Israel's own model now
forecast the key rate rising another percentage point to 4.0
percent by the end of the year. [ID:nLDE72T1KA]
 Gil Chen, head bond trader at the IBI brokerage, said there
had been heavy selling of inflation-linked bonds in favour of
fixed-rate bonds after the Bank of Israel's action.
 HSBC economist Jonathan Katz noted that before the latest
hike, the market was expecting inflation to exceed the
government's target of 1 to 3 percent for the next five years.
It is not yet clear how much those expectations are changing;
the central bank will next release monthly data on inflation
expectations in late April. [ID:nLDE72L0LH]
 But Katz said, ""People were basically saying that he will
consistently miss the inflation target, so he was losing a bit
of credibility. I think he has regained that in part.""
 
 SHEKEL
 Inflation, boosted by housing, energy and food costs,
reached an annual rate of 4.2 percent in February and is
expected by private analysts to stay around 4 percent for the
rest of 2011. [ID:nJES000058] 
 Fischer had been reluctant to move interest rates more than
a quarter-point at a time to prevent rapid appreciation of the
shekel  , which would damage exports -- more than
40 percent of Israel's econonic activity.
 The shekel, currently at a 29-month high of 3.51 per dollar,
has moved little since the latest rate hike, largely because of
expectations that the central bank could intervene in the market
if necessary or authorities could conceivably impose stricter
capital controls.
 Also, investors are expecting a European Central Bank
interest rate hike next week, while the U.S. Federal Reserve
might raise rates sooner than originally anticipated.
 Analysts are unsure whether Monday's half-point increase in
Israel was a one-off event or the start of a trend for the
central bank.
 But Barclays economist Daniel Hewitt, the lone analyst who
had predicted a half-point move this week in a Reuters poll,
expects a similar move next month.
 ""Its gradual rate increases have not been enough to keep
inflation under control,"" he said of quarter-point hikes.
 David Lubin, an emerging markets strategist at Citigroup,
wrote in a note to clients that the half-point hike ""appears to
be an admission of failure to some extent and probably leaves
the market in a state of confusion about how the bank will
pursue its tightening strategy.""

 ROME, March 30 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund
has cut its forecast for Japan's 2011 GDP growth after this
month's devastating earthquake and has also lowered its near
term outlook for the United States, Italian news agency ANSA
reported on Wednesday.
 The IMF cut Japan's 2011 growth forecast to 1.4 percent from
a previous projection of 1.6 percent in January and cut its
forecast for the United States to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent,
ANSA said, citing a draft of the IMF's World Economic Outlook
report to be issued in April.
 However, the Fund's forecasts for 2012 have been increased
to 2.1 percent from 1.8 percent for Japan and to 3.0 percent
from 2.8 percent for the United States, ANSA reported.
 The IMF slightly raised its forecast for euro zone growth
this year to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent and increased the 2012
forecast to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent, ANSA said.
 The IMF made no change to its growth forecasts for China,
seen at 9.6 percent in 2011 and 9.5 percent in 2012, and also
left unchanged its global growth forecast for this year, seen at
4.4 percent, ANSA said.
 Its report did not include the IMF's forecast for 2012
global growth.
 The IMF trimmed its projection for Indian growth to 8.2
percent from 8.4 percent, and lowered its 2012 outlook to 7.8
percent from 8.0 percent.
 Italian growth has been raised marginally to 1.1 percent
from 1.0 percent for 2011 and left unchanged at 1.3 percent for
2012, significantly lagging the euro zone average in both years.
 Italy has been one of the euro zone's most sluggish
economies for over a decade.

 NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - World stocks rose to near
three-week highs on Wednesday and U.S. stocks climbed in early
trade as optimism about potential gains in the coming quarter
eclipsed concerns about Japan's nuclear crisis and turmoil in
the oil-rich Arab world.
 Wall Street was also boosted by data that showed solid
gains in private sector jobs in March and by merger and
acquisition activity.
 The yen slipped to a 10-month low versus the euro and was
broadly weaker as recent hawkish comments from euro zone and
U.S. officials contrasted with Japan's loose monetary policy
stance.
 ""It does seem as if markets are now keen to try and turn
the page,"" said Ben Potter, analyst at IG Markets.
 Although the ongoing unrest in Libya, which has shut down
oil exports from the OPEC producer, and Japan's earthquake and
nuclear are still affecting financial markets in a big way,
investors appeared ready to move on from these crises. ""There
is...appetite to speculate on these outcomes for now,"" Potter
said.
 Some investors continued to seek safe havens, driving up
the price of gold about 1 percent as the Middle East unrest fed
market jitters. Gains were capped by expectations that monetary
policy in Europe and the United States may tighten.
 Recent hawkish comments from the euro zone and from U.S.
officials that have contrasted with Japan's loose monetary
policy stance drove the yen to 10-month low versus the euro of
117.28 yen. The euro was seen climbing further on expectations
the European Central Bank will start raising interest rates as
early as April.
 Against the dollar, the yen fell to a near three-week low
at 83.19 yen .
 ""We've had comments from the Fed and a shift in sentiment
towards the U.S. policy from a rate perspective that has really
pushed U.S.-Japan yield differentials, driving the dollar
higher,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of global FX strategy at
Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
 The market's focus on rate differentials benefited
higher-yielding currencies including the Australian dollar
, which traded at $1.03090, near a 29-year high of
$1.0334 hit earlier in the global trading day.
 Oil prices fell, with U.S. crude  losing almost half
a percent to hover below $104.50 a a barrel, hurt by swelling
crude inventories in the United States and expectations that
the Obama administration will set a long-term target to cut oil
imports.

 * Commercial uncertainty over dealing with rebel shipments
 
 By Jonathan Saul
 LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - Libyan oil shipments remain at
a standstill, with no one attempting to hire tankers at the
moment due to violence and the impact of sanctions, shipping
sources said on Wednesday.
 Oil shipments from Africa's third-largest producer have been
blocked for weeks due to heavy fighting and western sanctions on
the Libyan government. A NATO arms embargo at sea on leader
Muammar Gaddafi has also meant further potential shipping
disruptions.
 ""There has been no crude oil, no fuel oil and no clean
products out of Libya for about 10 or 12 days,"" a shipping
source said. ""There is no Libya enquiry at the moment from
anywhere.""
 Libyan rebels pulled out of the oil town of Ras Lanuf on
Wednesday under heavy bombardment from Gaddafi's forces, showing
their weakness without Western air strikes to tip the scales in
their favour.
 ""Forget Libyan trade for a while, it's war there,"" another
shipping source said.
 Libya produced about 1.6 million barrels of oil per day
before the crisis, or almost 2 percent of world output.
 ""A large number of shipping firms are avoiding comment on
working in Libya, mainly because of reputation concerns,"" said
John Drake, a senior risk consultant with security firm AKE.
 Sources said the mounting uncertainty involved in potential
Libya trades was also killing off activity.
 Highlighting the growing risks, Libya's government warned on
Wednesday it would sue any international company that concluded
energy deals with the rebels.
 ""Firms and organisations are also likely going to be wary of
doing business with one side or the other while the situation
remains so fluid,"" AKE's Drake said.
 ""If you establish a partnership with one side, it will
likely rule out the possibility of future trade with the other,
so many will not want to commit when the frontline continues to
shift and the final outcome remains uncertain.""
 
 REBEL EXPORTS
 A senior Libyan rebel official has said Gulf oil producer
Qatar, which this week became the first Arab country to
recognise the rebels, had agreed to market oil produced from
east Libyan fields that are no longer under Gaddafi's control.
 Separately, the United States has said crude oil sales by
Libyan rebels would not be subject to U.S. sanctions if they
avoid Gaddafi-linked entities.
 International sanctions are designed to cut off funding to
Gaddafi, but shipping sources said there were still too many
unknowns at the moment in trading with rebels, especially in
relation to payment mechanisms.
 ""It's all very well the U.S. and Qatar making statements, but
whether they are backed by something that is fundamentally
commercial remains to be seen,"" said John Dalby, chief executive
with maritime risk management specialists MRM.
 ""If they are not, there will be a lot of doubt and worry
about getting involved.""

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2011 10:04AM ET</span>",WTO to rule on claims Boeing received subsidies," By Tim Hepher and Andrew Callus
 PARIS/GENEVA, March 30 (Reuters) - A long-running
transatlantic trade dispute over illegal state handouts for
Airbus and Boeing comes to a head on Thursday with the latest
ruling from the World Trade Organisation.
 The United States and European Union, both trading
superpowers, have been fighting cases against each other in the
WTO for more than six years over each other's subsidies for
manufacturers of large passenger aircraft.
 Thursday's document will contain the WTO's 1,000-page
findings on European Union claims that U.S. planemaker Boeing
won billions of dollars in unfair U.S. support.
 The trade bloc brought the case after the United States
protested against subsidies benefitingEuropean planemaker
Airbus. The WTO found parts of the financing for Airbus planes
was illegal in its report on that case last year.
 The two cases represent the world's largest trade dispute
and could help determine how not only Airbus and Boeing, but
potential future competitors in China, Russia, Brazil, Japan and
Canada, run their growing aircraft sectors for years to come.
 However, analysts say it could be months or even years
before appeals and possible compliance procedures are exhausted.
 
 DISAGREE STRONGLY
 EADS subsidiary Airbus said the final report on the case
against the United States over Boeing subsidies would damage its
rival's past claims that it was market-funded. The EU says NASA,
states and the Pentagon all pumped in funds unfairly.
 ""Boeing can no longer hide they received massive illegal
subsidies that have severely harmed Airbus. Despite years of
denial and attempts to minimize the research grants and state
subsidies it receives, the public report will show the
contrary,"" spokeswoman Maggie Bergsma said.
 Boeing has acknowledged that the WTO backed some of the EU
claims. However, the two sides disagree strongly over the amount
of condemned Boeing subsidies and how they compared in size and
effect with those given to Airbus. 
 ""We are fully confident that the WTO will reveal tomorrow
the massive market advantage Airbus has enjoyed from illegal
government subsidies for more than 40 years,"" Boeing spokesman
Charlie Miller said. 
 ""From media reports quoting people who have seen the ruling,
it is clear that the WTO has rejected the vast majority of the
EU's claims in sharp contrast to last year's ruling that Airbus
had received illegal subsidies totalling more than $20 billion.""
 After an interim confidential report was delivered to the
parties in January, Airbus said it showed Boeing had received at
least $5 billion in illegal subsidies and was only able to
launch its 787 Dreamliner with such support. 
 Boeing denied the assertions and said Airbus had in any case
received a much larger boost from taxpayers.
 The two sides also disagree over whether the WTO's findings
in the earlier case will automatically disqualify possible
future government loans for the Airbus A350, an aircraft which
is being developed to compete with the Dreamliner.
 Both sides appealed aspects of the WTO's verdict on the
original U.S. case and U.S. sources say the WTO's appeals body
is expected to insist next month that Airbus remedy about $5
billion worth of illegal aid given in preferential public loans.
 European sources say both cases should be considered
together and say the best outcome would be political compromise.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
raise interest rates when it meets next week and is set to
follow with a couple more hikes by the end of the year as it
focuses on controlling inflation, a Reuters poll found.
 The poll of 80 economists, taken this week, found all but
four of them expecting the ECB to raise rates by 25 basis points
from a record low of 1.0 percent when it meets on April 7.
 ""Though southern Europe continues to struggle, the (ECB)
Governing Council believes that the risk of a wage-inflation
spiral developing in northern Europe poses a greater risk to
their price stability mandate,"" said Azad Zangana at Schroders.
 Inflation in the 17-country euro zone accelerated to 2.4
percent in February, further above the ECB's target of close to,
but below 2 percent, and has now been above target since
December.
 ""Inflation rates ... are now durably above the common
definition of price stability in the euro zone,"" ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet said on Monday.
 Trichet shocked markets at the bank's last policy meeting by
saying that an April rate rise was possible, putting it in pole
position to raise rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve and the
Bank of England.
 The poll gave a median 90 percent chance of a rate hike by
end-June and 97 percent by the end of the year, a massive jump
from the respective 25 and 68 percent medians ahead of the March
meeting.
The euro zone economy grew 0.3 percent in the final three
months of 2010 and recent data has suggested that a recovery
that was being led by Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has
started to filter down to struggling periphery members.
 Analysts polled by Reuters two weeks ago predicted first
quarter growth of a healthier 0.5 percent for the bloc.
 The poll predicted the ECB would raise rates by 25 basis
points per quarter through to next March. It would then pause
and then add 25 points in the third and fourth quarters of 2012,
ending next year at 2.5 percent, in line with an earlier poll.
 
 CORRIDOR WIDENING UNLIKELY
 In the final throes of slashing rates at the height of the
financial crisis, the ECB narrowed the gaps between its marginal
deposit rate and its main rate and between the main rate and an
emergency borrowing rate.
 Some policymakers had suggested the bank would widen the
'corridor' again when the time came to raise interest rates. ECB
board member Jozef Makuch suggested in an interview with Reuters
earlier this month, however, that it was not yet on the cards.
 ""The change in interest rates does not need to be
necessarily connected to a change in the interest rate
corridor,"" he said.
 Economists in the poll tended to agree with him as 32 of 55
said the bank would not widen the corridor back to 200 basis
points if it raises rates next month.
 An ECB interest rate hike next month would not carry the
normal sting if the bank takes the first opportunity to rewiden
its interest rate corridor, although any delay would leave the
rest of the job up to the euro zone's banks.
 ""Eventually the ECB may want to widen the corridor back to
200 basis points, but in terms of policy signalling it may be
best to do so under less volatile circumstances,"" said Elwin de
Groot at Rabobank.
 ""Because the next two rate hikes should be seen as 'warning
shots' to prevent second-round effects, a widening of the
corridor might blur that message.""

 NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - The yen slipped to a
10-month low versus the euro and was broadly weaker on
Wednesday as recent hawkish comments from euro zone and U.S.
officials contrasted with Japan's loose monetary policy stance.
 The euro rose to around 117.28 yen  on
electronic trading platform EBS, its strongest since May 2010,
and was seen climbing more on expectations the European Central
Bank will start raising interest rates as early as next month.
 Rising risk appetite encouraged investors to seek
higher-yielding assets, with the Australian dollar rising to a
29-year high over its U.S. counterpart  and a 10-month
high against the yen. 
 The U.S. dollar rose to around 83.19 yen , a level
last seen on March 11 when the yen initially fell after Japan's
earthquake. It lasst traded at 83.04 yen, up 0.7 percent.
 Traders reported offers at 83.30/50, with orders then said
to be thin until more supply placed at around 84.00.
 The dollar briefly trimmed gains against the euro and yen
on Wednesday after data showed the U.S. private sector added
jobs in March in line with expectations. [ID:nN30284764].
 ""The new high in the Australian dollar combined with
weakness in yen suggest that the carry trade is building
momentum,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""This could put significant
weakening pressure on yen, but we would not be surprised to see
some dollar/yen downside (yen strength) on the back of ongoing
repatriation in late in April.""
 Hawkish comments in recent days from U.S. Federal Reserve
and European Central Bank officials contrasted with the stance
taken by the Bank of Japan, which is set to leave interest
rates near zero for some time to support the world's
third-largest economy as it recovers from the effects of the
earthquake.
 Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said on Tuesday he
would vote against further monetary easing after the Federal
Reserve's $600 billion bond buying programme ends in June.
[ID:nN2984973]
 That pushed up short-dated U.S. Treasury yields, widening
their differential with Japanese ones as investors took the
comments as an indication of eventual monetary tightening.
 ""The yen is very sensitive to rate differentials, and with
U.S. short-end yields going up on expectations the Fed will at
some point raise rates, the dollar is rising against the yen,""
said Marcus Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in Zurich.
 The comments supported the U.S. dollar across the board,
nudging the euro  down 0.2 percent on the day to $1.4082.
 Credit Suisse's Hettinger said dollar gains may be
short-lived as an actual rate rise by the Fed is still expected
to be a long way off, while expectations the ECB will raise
rates next month and beyond would continue to support the euro.
 Such anticipation has pushed the euro more than 5.0 percent
higher against the dollar this year, and its apparent
resilience to fiscal problems facing weak euro zone countries
has led some to nickname it the ""Teflon euro"".
 ""I would be confident in the euro at these levels,"" said
Pierre Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors.
""I like the euro, basically, and I see some upside.""
 AUSSIE SHINES
 Speculation that Japanese investors may reduce dollar
hedging positions related to their overseas investments, and
the absence of huge repatriation flows following the quake, are
shifting the focus back to economic fundamentals and
reinforcing the yen's status as a funding currency.
 ""We're seeing asset managers and hedge funds starting to
dip their toes back into carry trades, but it's quite tentative
at this stage,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS,
in an interview with Reuters Insider.

 Credit Suisse's Hettinger said dollar gains may be
short-lived as an actual rate rise by the Fed is still expected
to be a long way off, while expectations the ECB will raise
rates next month and beyond would continue to support the euro.
 Such anticipation has pushed the euro more than 5 percent
higher against the dollar this year, and its apparent resilience
to fiscal problems facing weak euro zone countries has led some
to nickname it the ""Teflon euro"".
 ""I would be confident in the euro at these levels,"" said
Pierre Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors.
""I like the euro, basically, and I see some upside.""
 He said he would be interested in the euro even if it moved
towards $1.45-1.50, arguing that authorities were unlikely to
voice opposition to the euro at $1.50 given the outlook of
rising inflation and a pick-up in economic growth in the region.
 The sovereign debt crisis was unlikely to significantly
weaken the euro in the longer term as long as it did not lead to
a break-up of the euro zone, Lequeux said, while a weak jobs
picture would keep the Fed from raising rates any time soon.

(Adds background, detail, quote)
 BUDAPEST, March 30 (Reuters) - Hungary's banks are very
close to an agreement with the government on how to handle the
country's large stock of non-performing loans, Bank Association
Chariman Tamas Erdei said on Wednesday.
 ""Negotiations are very advanced,"" Erdei told reporters. ""I
think it's very likely that we'll reach a deal by the middle of
April, or the second half of April at the latest.""
 Hungary's households took out trillions of forints worth of
loans that were denominated mainly in Swiss francs at a time
when the franc was much weaker than it is now, which has lead to
a spike in payments and non-paying customers.
 At the end of 2010, 11 percent of household loan holders
were not able to pay their loans, according to the central bank.
The government last year imposed a moratorium on evictions to
avoid masses of people being forced out of their homes.
 A deadline on lifting the moratorium was recently extended
to July 1 from April 15.
 Erdei said banks were open to a range of solutions that
include temporarily freezing conversion rates on foreign
currency mortgage payments, but he insisted that the moratorium
be lifted by July 1.
 ""It is very important that an agreement is sealed and the
accompanying legislation is passed by July 1 because the
moratorium must be lifted - with some conditions, so as to avoid
big market swings,"" he said.
 Hungary's government is planning to offer all household
Swiss franc loan holders the option of fixing monthly repayments
below 200 forints per franc to make debt servicing more
predictable, a government lawmaker said on Tuesday.
 The option is part of a package of solutions formed by the
government and the banking sector, which the prime minister said
he expected to be wrapped up in May.

 LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - The yen slipped to a 10-month
low versus the euro and suffered broadly on Wednesday after
recent hawkish comments from euro zone and U.S. officials
contrasted with Japan's loose monetary policy stance.
 The euro rose to around 117.30 yen, its strongest since May,

with further tightening possible.
 The dollar rose to around 83.15 yen, a level last seen on

Offers around that level capped further gains for the moment and

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2011 06:12AM ET</span>",Germany seen raising renewable energy output 50 pct," By Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, March 30 (Reuters) - German companies plan to raise
investment in renewable energy production capacity by 50 percent
to an annual 6.2 billion euros ($8.74 billion) within the next
three years, the country's renewable energy authorities said.
 A survey of 304 companies involved in producing equipment
for renewable energy production, carried out for industry bodies
BEE and AEE, found that 80 percent expect turnover to rise each
year by 2014, with over half hoping for double-digit growth.
 Some 4 billion euros will be invested in new production
capacity in Germany this year, the survey found.
 The survey was completed in early March before the nuclear
disaster in Japan prompted the German government to revise its
plans on extending the lifespans of the country's 17 nuclear
reactors. Officials said that should boost growth even further.
 ""We'll most probably have to adjust the findings upwards if
the government is serious about changing its energy strategy,""
BEE managing director Bjoern Klusmann told a news conference.
""We could easily ramp up production to be able to replace
nuclear energy in Germany by 2020 at the latest.""
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's government passed legislation
last year to extend the lifespan of the 17 nuclear reactors by
an average of 12 years beyond a previous 2022 cut-off date.
 But after the Japanese nuclear disaster, Merkel retreated
and declared a three-month moratorium on the extensions. She
also temporarily shut seven older plants. That upset her party's
business wing and did not impress voters in Baden-Wuerttemberg,
where the CDU suffered a major election defeat on Sunday.
 German firms are among world leaders in renewable energy and
making equipment used for machines that turn wind and sunshine
into electricity. The country gets 17 percent of its electricity
from renewables and aims to raise that to 40 percent by 2020.
 Germany overtook the United States to move into second place
behind China in clean-energy investment last year, according to
a report released on Tuesday called ""Who's Winning the Clean
energy Race"" by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
 A total of $41.2 billion was invested in renewable energy
in Germany last year, the survey found, compared with $54.4
billion invested in China and $34 billion in the United States.

 * China already has strict capital controls in place
 * Analyst says measures to help ease hot money inflows
(Adds details and quotes)	
 BEIJING, March 30 (Reuters) - Chinese banks must cut their
short dollar positions and also reduce their short-term foreign
debt holdings, the currency regulator said on Wednesday.	
 The tightening of existing restrictions is the latest step
by China to cut the scope for capital inflows betting on faster
yuan appreciation.	
 In a short statement on its website, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said it wanted to
prevent illegal inflows and protect national financial security.	
 ""SAFE is taking various measures to repel potential
speculative inflows and I think the recent steps will definitely
show some results,"" said E Yongjian, an economist at Bank of
Communications.	
 China already has strict controls in place to block
speculative inflows and regularly tries to reinforce them, an
objective that has become more important in recent months as
yuan appreciation has edged up.	
 ""It will also help reduce the foreign exchange purchases,
which could ease pressure on the central bank to sterilise in
the money market,"" E Yongjian said.	
 To keep the yuan from rising too quickly against the dollar,
China buys most of the foreign exchange that enters the country
and must then mop up -- or sterilise -- the yuan that is created
in the process to guard against inflation.	
 
 NEW RULES	
 Under SAFE's new rules, Chinese banks that had dollar-short
positions of $2 billion or more as of November 8 must reduce
them by 60 percent, SAFE said. Banks with short positions of $2
billion or less must cut these in half.	
 Banks whose foreign exchange positions are lower than the
required minimum amount must gradually increase them to meet the
quota requirement before September 30, it said.	
 It did not spell out the change in foreign debt quotas, but
said they would be lowered again after last year's 1.5 percent
cut. Short-term foreign debt is seen in part as a bet on yuan
appreciation. 
 Banks must also first check that trade deals are genuine
before they make any foreign exchange transaction for their
clients, according to the statement.	
 In another tightening on capital flows, Chinese enterprises
must cut their advanced payments from importers and delayed
payments to exporters to, respectively, 20 percent of the total
foreign exchanges they sold or bought over the past twelve
months, the statement added.	
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said its order
would go into effect on April 1.

of the state of the country's beleaguered banking sector.
 ""We need finally an honest assessment, one that is based on
best international practices,"" he told German newspaper
Handelsblatt.
 ""Afterwards there can be no feeling that people are looking
at Irish banks through rose-tinted glasses ... Our ambition is
to clean the table and we will do that.""
 Bruton said it was hard to ease Irish banks' dependence on
central bank liquidity as long as they were undercapitalised.
 ""It is very difficult to improve banks' liquidity need, when
there is a feeling that banks do not have enough capital,""
Bruton told the daily.
 He also said Ireland was committed to meeting all its fiscal
obligations under the EU/IMF rescue package. He also warned
against raising the corporate tax rate, saying it would have hit
investor confidence.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2011 04:48AM ET</span>","UPDATE 2-Japan orders nuclear safety steps, plans energy review"," * New steps aimed at ensuring nuclear plant safety against
tsunami
 * Mobile generators, fire trucks, training must be in place
in April
 * Japan to review energy policy to promote renewables -trade
minister
 * Ministry studying ways to expand power supply from west to
east
(Rewrites with review of energy policy, adds details)	
 By Risa Maeda	
 TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - Japan's trade ministry ordered
nuclear power plant operators to take immediate steps to improve
emergency preparedness and will review energy policies to
promote renewable sources and ease power shortages as it
grapples with a nuclear safety crisis.	
 The ministry said on Wednesday that nuclear plants would be
required by mid-April to deploy back-up mobile power generators
and fire trucks able to pump water, while beefing up training
programmes and manuals, aiming to avoid a repeat of the crisis
at the Fukushima nuclear plant.	
 It will also look at longer-term solutions such as requiring
higher sea walls at nuclear stations and will review its energy
policy to encourage renewables, although it reiterated that
nuclear power was expected to retain an important role.	
 ""As Prime Minister (Naoto) Kan has said in parliamentary
debates, I think we should also put emphasis on renewable energy
sources, such as solar power,"" Trade Minister Banri Kaieda told
a news conference.	
 ""We should discuss our energy policy as a whole.""	


 The crippled Fukushima complex in northeastern
Japan continues leaking radiation more than two weeks
after it was battered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a
14-metre (46-foot) tsunami.	
 The government and the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric
Power Co , have conceded there is no end in sight to the
world's worst nuclear crisis since the Chernobyl accident a
quarter of a century ago.	
 
 IMMEDIATE STEPS	
 The immediate safety measures ordered by the ministry are
intended to prevent a tsunami from knocking out power, and
especially cooling systems, at nuclear reactors and pools of
spent fuel rods, which was the main cause of the crises at four
Fukushima Daiichi reactors.	
 The plants would be allowed to continue operations during
the implementation of the safety measures, which must be
verified by the government by end-April, in order to ensure
sufficient power supplies.	
 ""These are the minimum steps we can think of right now that
should be done immediately,"" Kaieda said.	
 Japan's regional utilities have already announced plans to
address safety concerns.	
 Central Japan's Chubu Electric Power Co said
last week it would build a 12-metre tsunami wall over
the next few years to protect its Hamaoka plant, located in a
coastal region where the government has predicted a high
probability of a major earthquake within the next three decades.
[ID:nL3E7EN18J]	
 Kansai Electric Power Co , which serves Japan's
second-largest metropolis in Osaka, said it would spend 50
billion to 100 billion yen ($620 million-$1.23 billion) on
improving safety for its nuclear plants. [ID:nL3E7ES0UN].	
 Nearly 90 percent of Japan's 54 reactors have yet
to comply with upgraded 2006 safety guidelines for protection
from a massive tsunami.	
 Kaieda said nuclear power, which accounts for 30 percent of
Japan's electricity output, was an important part of its energy
portfolio, and running reactors in the undamaged west was
essential to secure power for overall industrial output.	
 The Tokyo area has been hit by rolling power blackouts since
the quake took out more than 20 percent of Tokyo Electric's
generating capacity, including the Fukushima complex.	
 Fears are mounting that wider power outages in the peak
demand months of summer could severely harm Japan's economy.	
 Incompatible power frequencies in eastern and western Japan
make it impossible for Tokyo and the battered northeast to tap
power from the west, except through special linkage facilities
that so far can only provide a modest 1,000 megawatts (MW).	
 ""We're studying measures now, but we'd like to have more
power being provided to the east from the west,"" Kaieda said.	
 Tokyo Electric, which on Wednesday said it would scrap the
Fukushima plant's four troubled reactors, could face a shortfall
of nearly 10,000 MW in the summer.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - World stocks rose to near
three-week highs on Wednesday, driven by optimism about
potential gains in the coming quarter and setting aside concerns
about Japan's nuclear crisis and turmoil in the Arab world.
 Wall Street also looked set to open higher.
 Japan's yen dipped to a 10-month low against the euro and
neared a three-week trough versus the dollar on expectations
that interest rates will rise in Europe and the United States.
 In recent days, several top U.S. central bank officials have
said further bond purchases by the Federal Reserve are not
needed to support the economy, while the European Central Bank
is seen as all-but certain to raise rates in April.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was up 0.6 percent,
taking its year-to-date gains to nearly 3.5 percent and up more
than 6 percent since a post-Japan earthquake low on March 15.
 Emerging markets were up more than 1 percent on the day at a
two-month high.
 This has occurred despite serious headwinds from political
revolts in North Africa and the Middle East, and the economic
fears stemming from Japan's triple disasters.
 ""The two big geopolitical stories -- the aftermath of the
earthquake in Japan and unrest in Libya -- remain vary much in
play but with the backdrop not changing significantly on a
day-by-day basis, it does seem as if markets are now keen to try
and turn the page,"" said Ben Potter, an analyst at IG Markets.
""Clearly there is still scope for significant developments
here but there is little appetite around to speculate on these
outcomes for now.""
 The pan-Europe FTSEurofirst 300 gained 0.9 percent.
 ""It does not seem to want to go down despite everything that
is thrown at it,"" said Andrea Williams of Royal London Asset
Management.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average climbed 2.6 percent, hitting
its highest level since suffering a post-quake panic sell-off.
 
 RATE DIFFERENTIAL
 On currency markets, the yen fell broadly, hitting 10-month
lows against the euro and touching its lowest level in nearly
three weeks versus the dollar as interest rate differentials
widened in favour of U.S. and European currencies.
 ""We've had comments from the Fed and a shift in sentiment
towards the U.S. policy from a rate perspective that has really
pushed U.S.-Japan yield differentials, driving the dollar
higher,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of global FX strategy at
Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
 The dollar gained 0.8 percent to 83.11 yen and the euro
gained 0.6 percent to 117.11 yen.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.4091.
 German 10 year bond yields were slightly higher, tracking
price losses in U.S. Treasuries after Fed officials enccouraged
expectations of broadly tighter monetary policy.
 Portuguese and Greek bonds also looked set to remain
pressured after a new round of rating downgrades.

 China rejected the container ship, the MOL Presence, when it
arrived at the port of Xiamen in eastern Fujian province, saying
it detected ""abnormal"" radiation levels, but did not disclose
China's standard level.	
 ""The MOL Presence is now off Kobe port and undergoing

unloading its cargo at a foreign port over radiation concerns
since Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant was crippled by the March
11 earthquake.

port after Xiamen, a company spokeswoman said.	
 The MOL Presence originated in California, stopping in Tokyo
for only a few hours on March 17 before arriving in China four
days later, port authorities said.	
 Ports in Tokyo Bay, located 240 km (150 miles) south of the
Fukushima nuclear plant, is considered safe by most shipping

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2011 03:04AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Should the world be more like Belgium?," HELD TOGETHER BY RED TAPE
 One requirement for any country considering a spell without
an elected government is a functioning bureaucracy. Belgians
like to carp about the size and cost of theirs -- the business
federation says it has 7 more civil servants per 1,000 citizens
than its nearest neighbours, at an extra cost of 5 to 6 billion
euros a year -- but it keeps things working, which may be a
cost worth paying for now.
 ""It may have faced criticism, but our government
administration is certainly functioning,"" said Ghent
University's Devos. Unlike in some countries, such as the United
States, senior civil servants in Europe are generally not
elected or appointed by ruling parties, which makes any period
of transition smoother.
 On top of that, many players besides politicians have
pivotal roles. ""The system is less dependent on a dominant
leader. You have unions and employer groups, controlling
agencies,"" said Keukeleire, of the University of Leuven and
College of Europe. ""The European Union, international
organisations and international agreements also determine the
limits of government.""
 In fact, central government in Belgium doesn't actually have
all that much power at all. It's restricted to managing public
finances, the army, judicial system, foreign affairs and certain
other issues such as social security and nuclear power. That
makes leadership a less coveted prize than in more centralised
countries.
 It's a similar story in the Netherlands, next door.
 ""In some countries, the president can appoint ministers,
judges and people in administrative functions and in the army,""
says Jan Tuit, a senior adviser at the Netherlands Institute for
Multiparty Democracy. ""If you look at for example the power of
the Dutch prime minister, it's really very limited. He cannot
even reshuffle the cabinet.""
 And the longer Belgium's caretaker government has been in
charge, the more powers it is assuming, or being given.
 ""Of course it's better to have a government with full
competence, but it's possible as a caretaker government to take
many decisions and we are doing that,"" acting Finance Minister
Didier Reynders told Reuters.
 The country's constitution has nothing to say on caretaker
governments. In theory, a stand-in government would just cover a
month or two before a new administration is sworn in, but the
prolonged deadlock means the unwritten rules are changing.
 ""As time goes by, the scope of decisions taken by the
government is widening. You could not have imagined six months
ago that the government would nominate a new director of the
national bank. Now they have done so,"" said Rudi Thomaes, chief
executive of the Federation of Enterprises in Belgium.
 Having a monarch has also helped. As head of state, King
Albert II has been busy appointing mediators, but he has also
demanded the caretaker government revise the 2011 budget, a
highly unusual intervention.
 
 NOT ONE, BUT MANY GOVERNMENTS
 And despite the vacuum at the top, Belgium has plenty of
government to keep it ticking over. The country has five
federated regional governing bodies, not counting provincial and
local authorities. ""You cannot say that Belgium is stuck,"" says
Ghent University's Devos. ""We have many other governments
running the country.""
 There are separate administrations representing the regions
of Wallonia and Brussels, for French speakers and for
German-speaking minority and a joint one covering the province
of Flanders and Dutch speakers.
 In a series of reforms since 1970, the powers of the regions
and language communities have grown and those of the federal
state shrunk. That's at the heart of the current impasse:
Dutch-speaking Flemish people, who make up about 60 percent of
the Belgian population, have voted for parties seeking yet more
control for the regions and fewer subsidies for French-speaking
Wallonia, where the unemployment rate is double that of
Flanders.
 Yet in some ways it's a boon: already, culture and education
are the exclusive preserves of the language communities. The
regions control a wide range of policy areas including the
economy, employment, agriculture, housing, energy, transport and
foreign trade.
 Lambertz, premier of Belgium's German speakers, says the
federal system has helped in the present crisis. ""The current
system isn't all that bad. Otherwise, it would have collapsed or
the country would have found itself in crisis and that is not
the case. Whoever travels through Belgium doesn't notice much of
the current difficulties,"" he said.
 DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME
 Federal states from Australia to Switzerland might also
benefit from their multiple layers of government in the absence
of a national administration.
 But in most places, and especially in the developing world,
strong political leaders are needed to fill the hole created by
a lack of bureaucracy. In Iraq last year, for example, nine
months of political limbo delayed investments to rebuild the
war-torn country and left people short of basic services such as
water and power.
 Even in developed democracies, being without political
leadership can be crippling. The lack of a plan to manage its
debts has sent Portugal's bond yields to new highs this week,
inflating the cost of borrowing and increasing the chances the
country will need an international bailout. Portugal faces a
political vacuum of at least two months, if a snap election is
called, with a caretaker government reduced to basic management
of public affairs.
 ""It's a pretty messy situation,"" says Ken Wattret, chief
euro zone economist at BNP Paribas. ""In the Belgian context that
may be fine, but Portugal has a pressing need to deliver a
credible consolidation programme.""
 And even Belgium has had to put important decisions on hold.
Analysts and economists say it needs to reform its pensions
system and its labour market, reduce energy consumption and
determine what to do with asylum seekers. It's muddling along
with unresolved questions about the future of nuclear power.
These are decisions for the long term that a caretaker
government simply cannot take.
 ""The longer these items are unresolved, the more costly they
become We have a fire brigade to put out fires, but we cannot
renovate the building,"" said Ghent University's Devos.
 The business federation says a government is urgently needed
to rein in the debt and tackle the rising cost of an ageing
population. Its chief, Rudi Thomaes, said the deadlock really
began four years ago at the 2007 election, as disputes over the
future of the country stalled progress elsewhere.
 ""If I make the comparison with other countries I see a huge
difference,"" Thomaes says, poring over a chart listing the
budgetary efforts of six countries - France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.
 Yet Devos and others say that Belgium might need a crisis
such as this to force through change acceptable to its Dutch and
French speakers. It may indeed look back on nine month or even a
year of political deadlock as a price worth paying.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2011 03:04AM ET</span>",China economist blasts dollar dominance on eve of G20," * Paper by economist from group organising China G20 meeting
 * Says countries, IMF must act to stabilise reserve
currencies
 * Proposals unlikely to garner support from developed
economies

 BEIJING, March 30 (Reuters) - Dollar dominance is sowing the
seeds of financial turmoil, and the solution is to promote new
reserve currencies, a Chinese government economist said in a
paper published on the eve of a G20 meeting about how to reform
the global monetary system.	
 Although not an official policy statement, the paper by Xu
Hongcai, a department deputy director at the China Center for
International Economic Exchanges, offered a window onto the
domestic pressures bearing on Beijing to move away from a
dollar-centric global economy.	
 The China Center, a top government think tank, has
represented the Chinese government in organising a forum on
Thursday in Nanjing that will bring together finance ministers,
central bankers and academics from the Group of 20 wealthy and
developing economies.	
 Xu's paper, ""Reform of the international monetary system
under the G20 framework"", was published in Chinese on the
center's website this week (www.cciee.org.cn).	
 ""Nations around the world have no way of restricting dollar
issuance by the Federal Reserve. The current international
monetary system lacks both stability and fairness,"" Xu wrote.	
 He said the global monetary system had fallen into a ""dollar
trap"". While it would be sensible to reduce dollar holdings in
official currency reserves, nations cannot easily cut back,
because doing so would only lead the dollar to weaken and so hit
the value of their assets, he said.	
 
 
 CHINA'S DILEMMA	
 China's dollar dilemma is particularly acute, though Xu did
not say as much. China had $2.85 trillion in foreign exchange
reserves at the end of last year, more than any other country.
About two-thirds are estimated to be invested in dollars.	
 Beijing has repeatedly warned that loose U.S. monetary
policy threatens the dollar, but it has continued to accumulate
dollar assets at the same time, adding about $260 billion of
Treasury securities last year, according to U.S. data.	
 With the Chinese government determined to limit yuan
appreciation, it must buy a large amount of the dollars
streaming into the country from its trade surplus and recycle
those into U.S. investments.	
 Xu was not shy about proposing ways to remake the global
monetary system.	
 For a start, he said diversification was needed, with
several reserve currencies. Other countries could reinforce
these currencies' status by buying or selling them to keep their
exchange rates stable, Xu said.	
 He said the International Monetary Fund should also play a
policing role.	
 ""If any international reserve currency depreciates, the IMF
would be responsible for issuing a timely alert, increasing
international pressure to force the country in question to take
measures to stabilise its currency,"" he said.	
 
 LITTLE SUPPORT	
 Xu's call for regular intervention to keep key currencies
steady is unlikely to find much support among developed
economies, which have come to view a system of floating, largely
market-determined exchange rates as the most stable underpinning
of the global economy.	
 When the G7 rich countries banded together to weaken the yen
earlier this month, it was their first joint intervention since
2000 and came against the extraordinary background of
speculator-driven yen appreciation after Japan's devastating
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis.	
 Xu also suggested that the Special Drawing Right, the IMF's
unit of account, should gradually be built into a global reserve
currency, although he noted this would still be a long time off.	
 Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said two years
ago that the SDR would be better than the dollar as a
supra-national reserve currency, disconnected from the interests
of any single country.	
 With France at the helm of the G20 this year, French
President Nicolas Sarkozy has seized on the SDR idea, promoting
it as a possible alternative to the dollar-led global monetary
order. But China itself appears to have cooled on the SDR,
instead describing it as a largely symbolic issue.	
 For all the defects in the global monetary system identified
by Xu, foreign officials, especially from the United States,
have said that China has a much easier solution within its
grasp.	
 By allowing the yuan to float freely, the Chinese central
bank would no longer need to buy dollars flowing into the
country and so could drastically slow its accumulation of
foreign exchange reserves.

 By Richard Leong	
 March 30 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rallied on Wednesday as
investors snapped up riskier assets on attractive valuations,
while Japanese exporters were helped by the yen's weakness on
expectations of interest rate rises in Europe and the United
States.	
 Renewed demand for shares came despite concerns the global
economy could be hurt by Japan's struggle to contain the world's
worst nuclear crisis in decades, conflicts in Libya and the
Middle East and Europe's festering sovereign debt problems.	
 Concerns over those risks have eased, for now, with
expectations that stocks worldwide will move higher into the new
quarter, analysts and traders said. 
 ""Global equities are stronger and it's risk-on again,"" a
trader at a U.S. investment bank said.	
 Japan's Nikkei index rose 2.4 percent in afternoon
trading, after two days of losses. So far in March, it has shed
8.8 percent, heading for its worst month since May 2010. Year to
date, the benchmark has fallen 5.3 percent.	
 Among individual stocks, Tokyo Electric Power was
the spotlight again, tumbling nearly 18 percent on concerns that
the operator of the quake-stricken nuclear reactors in
northeastern Japan may be nationalised. 
 
 
 Other Asian equities have recovered from their losses since
a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit northeast Japan on
March 11. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 1.5 percent on the day. It has risen 4.0
percent so far in March and up 0.6 percent this year.	
 MSCI's world index rose 0.3 percent, taking
its gains for the year so far to more than 3.1percent, with
weakness in Asia offset by strong gains early in the year in
major indexes in the United States and Europe as investors
rotated from emerging markets to large, developed ones.	
 The yen dipped to a 10-month low against the euro and neared
a three-week trough versus the dollar early in Asia, having
suffered broad losses after several chart support levels were
breached plus expectations of rising rates in Europe and United
States.	
 In recent days, several top U.S. central bank officials said
further bond purchases by the Federal Reserve were not needed to
support the economy, while European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet signaled his inflation concerns because of
rising food and energy prices.	
 
 SHIFT TO GRADUAL POLICY TIGHTENING	
 ""We've had comments from the Fed and a shift in sentiment
towards the U.S. policy from a rate perspective that has really
pushed U.S.-Japan yield differentials, driving the dollar
higher,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of global FX strategy at
Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.	
 The yield gap between two-year U.S. and Japanese government
debt has ballooned over the past 1-1/2 weeks to a tad more than
61 basis points, the widest since early February.	
 Two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to
traders' views on changes in Fed policy, hovered at their
highest in six weeks at 0.83 percent on Wednesday, while
two-year JGB yields have bounced in a tight range of 0.18
percent to 0.25 percent so far this year.	
 Traders have been adjusting their books and most investors
have moved to the sidelines in advance of the last day of the
quarter and Japan's fiscal year. Light volume has heightened
intraday volatility across financial markets.	
 The dollar rose as high as 83.02 yen , well above the
76.25 all-time low, which it scaled in the week after the quake.
It last traded at 82.94.	
 The euro touched 116.95 yen after breaking
through major resistance around 115.50/60, a level that has
capped the pair since May 2010. It last traded about 116.73.	
 Among precious metals, gold turned up modestly, snapping a
four-session losing streak as hawkish central bank comments
reduced its appeal as an inflation hedge. 
 Spot gold traded at $1,417.70 an ounce, after being
as high as $1,419.50 earlier. This compared with $1,415.95 late
in New York on Tuesday. It is 2 percent below the record high of
$1,447.40 set on March 24. 
 U.S. oil prices fell as an expected rise in U.S. domestic
crude stocks offset worries over turmoil in Libya and the Middle
East. 
 Several OPEC producers have boosted output recently to make
up for supply disruptions in Libya, easing supply concerns.	
 U.S. crude  fell 32 cents to $104.47 a barrel, while
Brent crude  declined 23 cents to $114.91.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - The yen fell broadly on
Wednesday, hitting 10-month lows against the euro and touching
its lowest level in nearly three weeks versus the dollar as
interest rate differentials widened in favour of U.S. and
European currencies.	
 Hawkish comments by Federal Reserve and European Central
Bank officials contrasted with the stance taken by the Bank of
Japan, which is set to leave interest rates near zero for some
time to support the world's third-largest economy as it recovers
from the effects of the March 11 earthquake.	
 Speculation that Japanese investors may reduce dollar
hedging positions related to their overseas investment and the
absence of huge repatriation flows following the quake are
shifting the focus back to economic fundamentals, which are
reinforcing the yen's status as a funding currency.	
 ""We've had comments from the Fed and a shift in sentiment
towards the U.S. policy from a rate perspective that has really
pushed U.S.-Japan yield differentials, driving the dollar
higher,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of global FX strategy at
Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.	
 ""The fiscal year-end isn't a story any more. The market is
coming round to the view we're not going to see the scale of
repatriation once expected.""	
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent on the day to a three-week peak
of 83.02 , having breached its 50-day moving average of
82.10. The next resistance level is seen at 83.30, the March 11
high.	
 The move gathered pace when Dallas Fed President Richard
Fisher told Fox Business he would vote against any further
monetary easing after the current $600 billion bond buying
programme ends in June. [ID:nN2984973]	
 The greenback is now above an 82.00 yen high marked on March
18, when Japanese authorities and other G7 central banks worked
in concert to stop runaway yen gains. This level will now act as
support.	
 A Japanese brokerage trader said there is a possibility
Japanese investors could reduce their hedges if they turn
negative on the yen's medium-term outlook, a factor that could
push the dollar towards 90-100 yen.	
 Some analysts also said there is a risk that Japan's trade
deficit could shrink, reducing natural upward pressure on the
yen, as exports are likely to fall in the aftermath of the quake
and energy and resource-related imports could rise.	
 The dollar is up nearly 9 percent against the yen since
hitting a record low of 76.25 yen on March 17.	
 
 YIELD BACK IN FOCUS	
 Wednesday's move came as the two-year U.S. Treasury yield
climbed to near six-week highs around 0.83 percent
after St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard urged the U.S. central
bank to begin reversing its campaign of monetary easing.	
 Bullard, who does not have a vote on Fed policy this year,
said the Fed could trim its $600 billion bond-buying programme
by $100 billion. [ID:nPRC003447]	
 ""Non-voting, regional Fed presidents might rarely have been

 The euro rose to 116.95 yen after breaking
through major resistance around 115.50/60, a level that has
capped the pair since May 2010.	
 The single currency has been driven by expectations that the
ECB, worried about inflation, may raise rates in April.	
 That view was supported by ECB Governing Council member
Jozef Makuch, who said on Tuesday the ECB was ""highly"" likely to
raise its main interest rate from the current record low level
of 1.0 percent next month. [ID:nFLATEE7LX] 
 ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark was also quoted as
saying the ECB should not delay raising interest rates.

 Wednesday's data is expected to show euro zone inflation
above the ECB's target of ""close to but below"" 2 percent.	
 Three-month euro interbank lending rates rose as high as
1.219 percent , the highest since June 2009. 
 The euro was down a quarter percent at $1.4078 while
the dollar index rose 0.1 percent against a basket of
major currencies, although it stayed well off last week's
15-month lows of 75.340.	
 Elsewhere, the Australian dollar rose to a fresh 29-year
peak of $1.0334 . It hit highs not seen since early
1982, when it was a managed currency. 
 Traders cited a confluence of supportive factors including
persistent talk of M&A flows, solid demand for higher-yielding

(Adds details, background)	
 BEIJING, March 30 (Reuters) - China's $300 billion sovereign
wealth fund is prepared to invest more in resource-rich Latin
America because it is confident in the region's growth
prospects, a senior official said on Wednesday.	
 Jin Liqun, chairman of the China Investment Corp.
supervisory board , told an investor forum he had just
returned from a trip to Brazil, Argentina and Chile and saw
great potential for trade and investment.	
 ""We are also optimistic on growth in Latin America and are
prepared to increase our investment there,"" Jin said. ""Brazil is
fast growing, but Chile, Colombia are also providing interesting
opportunities for private equity investors.""	
 He did not say which sectors CIC is interested in. 
 In the past, however, Chinese firms have bought into energy
and resource businesses in Latin America to feed China's
voracious appetite for raw materials and help fuel growth in the
world's second-largest economy.	
 ""My impression during my short-trip to Latin America
countries is that they would like us to invest in their home
countries,"" he said.	
 Jin, who was trying to persuade foreign private equity firms
to invest in China, said CIC is hunting for good deals and
recently invested in distressed assets including U.S. commercial
property.	
 The U.S. investment, made in the middle of 2010, earned a
return of 40 percent by the end of 2010, he said.	
 To boost CIC's overall performance, Jin said the state
investor has also invested in stand-lone funds such as those in
the energy and resource sector, and one that focuses on Europe. 
 He did not say if these funds were mutual funds, hedge funds
or private equity.	
 When asked if CIC had suffered any loss resulting from
Japan's earthquake and radiation disasters, Jin said the
sovereign wealth fund has no direct investment in Japan.	
 CIC was set up in 2007 to invest a slice of China's giant
foreign exchange reserves, which have ballooned to $2.85
trillion.	
 It earned 12 percent on its global investment in 2009,
reversing from a loss of 2 percent in 2008.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - The yen fell broadly on
Wednesday, hitting 10-month lows against the euro and touching
its lowest level in nearly three weeks versus the dollar as
interest rate differentials widened in favour of U.S. and
European currencies.	
 Hawkish comments by Federal Reserve and European Central
Bank officials contrasted with the stance taken by the Bank of
Japan, which is set to leave interest rates near zero for some
time to support the world's third-largest economy as it recovers
from the effects of the March 11 earthquake.	
 The absence of huge repatriation flows by Japanese investors
in the wake of the quake has shifted the focus back to economic
fundamentals, which are reinforcing the yen's status as a
funding currency for buying higher-yielding assets.	
 ""We've had comments from the Fed and a shift in sentiment
towards the U.S. policy from a rate perspective that has really
pushed U.S.-Japan yield differentials, driving the dollar
higher,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of global FX strategy at
Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.	
 ""The fiscal year-end isn't a story any more. The market is
coming round to the view we're not going to see the scale of
repatriation once expected.""	
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent on the day to a three-week peak
of 82.83 , having breached its 50-day moving average of
82.10. 
 The move gathered pace when Dallas Fed President Richard
Fisher told Fox Business he would vote against any further
monetary easing after the current $600 billion bond buying
programme ends in June. [ID:nN2961086]	
 It is now above a 82.00 high hit on March 18, when Japanese
authorities and other G7 central banks worked in concert to stop
runaway yen gains. This level would now act as a support.	
 A trader for a Japanese brokerage said yen-buying by
Japanese exporters may temper gains in dollar/yen during Tokyo
hours, and levels around 82.90 may become heavy.	
 He said there tends to be a dollar shortage before the
fiscal year-end, which is on Thursday, that may push the dollar
above 83.	
 Some analysts also said there is a risk that Japan's trade
deficit could shrink, reducing natural upward pressure on the
yen, as exports are likely to fall in the aftermath of the quake
and energy and resource-related imports could rise.	
 The dollar is up more than 8 percent against the yen since
hitting a record low of 76.25 yen on March 17.	
 
 YIELD BACK IN FOCUS	
 Wednesday's move came as the two-year U.S. Treasury yield
climbed to near six-week highs around 0.83 percent
after St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard urged the U.S. central
bank to begin reversing its campaign of monetary easing.	
 Bullard, who does not have a vote on Fed policy this year,
said the Fed could trim its $600 billion bond-buying programme
by $100 billion. [ID:nPRC003447]	
 ""Non-voting, regional Fed presidents might rarely have been
so important ... so long as they say what the market wants to
hear,"" David Watt, a strategist at RBC, wrote in a client note.	
 The euro briefly rose to 116.62 yen after

 By Richard Leong
 HONG KONG, March 30 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on
Wednesday as investors were drawn back to riskier assets by
attractive valuations, while Japanese exporters were helped by
the yen's weakness on expectations of interest rate rises in
Europe and the United States.
 Renewed demand for equities came despite concerns the
global economy could be hurt by Japan's struggle to contain the
world's worst nuclear crisis in decades, conflicts in Libya and
the Middle East and Europe's festering sovereign debt problems.
 Investor concerns over those risks have eased, for now,
with expectations that stocks worldwide will move higher into
the new quarter, analysts and traders said.
 ""Global equities are stronger and it's risk-on again,"" a
trader at a U.S. investment bank said.
 Japan's Nikkei index rose 0.48 percent in early trading,
after two days of losses. So far in March, it has shed 9.9
percent, heading for its worst month since May 2010. For the
year to date, the benchmark has fallen 6.4 percent.
 Other Asian equities have recovered from their losses since
a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit northeast Japan on
March 11. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.49 percent on the day. It has risen 3.5 percent so
far in March and up 0.1 percent quarter-to-date.
 MSCI's world index rose 0.2 percent, taking its gains for
the year so far to about 3 percent, with weakness in Asia
offset by strong gains early in the year in major indexes in
the United States and Europe as investors rotated from emerging
markets to large, developed ones.
 The yen dipped to a 10-month low against the euro and
neared a three-week trough versus the dollar early in Asia,
having suffered broad losses after several chart support levels
were breached and on expectations of rising rates in Europe and
United States.
 In recent days, several top U.S. central bank officials
said further bond purchases by the Federal Reserve were not
needed to support the economy, while European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled his inflation concerns
from rising food and energy prices.
 SHIFT TO GRADUAL POLICY TIGHTENING
 ""We've had comments from the Fed and a shift in sentiment
towards the U.S. policy from a rate perspective that has really
pushed U.S.-Japan yield differentials, driving the dollar
higher,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of global FX strategy at
Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
 Traders have been adjusting their books and most investors
have moved to the sidelines in advance of the last day of the
quarter and Japan's fiscal year. Light volume has heightened
intraday volatility across financial markets.
 The dollar rose as high as 82.87 yen , well above the 76.25
all-time low, which it scaled in the week after the quake.
 The euro climbed to 116.69 yen after breaking through major
resistance around 115.50/60, a level that has capped the pair
since May 2010. It last traded at 116.67.
 Among precious metals, gold was flat, paring initial gains,
after four consecutive losing sessions as hawkish central bank
comments reduced its appeal as an inflation hedge.
 Spot gold traded at $1,415.89 an ounce, after traded as
high as $1,419,50 earlier. This compared with $1,415.95 late in
New York on Tuesday. It is 2 percent below the record high of
$1,447.40 set on March 24.
 U.S. oil prices fell as an expected rise in U.S. domestic
crude stocks offset worries over turmoil in Libya and the
Middle East.
 Several OPEC producers have boosted output recently to make
up for supply disruptions in Libya as rebels fight government
forces, easing supply concerns.
 U.S. crude fell 61 cents to $104.19 a barrel, while Brent
crude slipped 57 cents to $114.59.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Rising U.S. bond yields on
Tuesday lifted the dollar above 82 yen for the first time since
Japan's recent currency intervention, and technical indicators
suggested the greenback may be poised to extend those gains.
 The euro also rose to its highest level against the yen
since May as markets braced for higher euro zone interest
rates. But the single currency was flat against the dollar as
another Federal Reserve official mused about the need to
tighten monetary policy.
 The dollar rose to 82.51 yen , its highest in more
than two weeks and above the 81.98 peak of March 18, the day
Japanese authorities intervened to stop runaway yen gains.
 A wider gap between U.S. and Japanese yields helped, with
the two-year U.S. Treasury yield up eight basis points at 0.81
percent. It was up 21 basis points since March 15.
 A dollar close above 81.50 yen in coming days could signal
a re-test of 83.30 yen, a level hit immediately after the March
11 earthquake, followed by the February high of 83.98, said BNP
Paribas technical strategist Andrew Chaveriat.
 ""The 82.25-82.50 area is key, and if we get above there,
you could see a substantial retracement of the overall February
decline,"" he said.
 The euro rose 1 percent to 116.24 yen , a
10-1/2-month high.
 The yen hit a record high after the earthquake and tsunami
on speculation the diaster would force Japanese investors to
liquidate overseas assets and bring money home.
 But Steven Englander, head of G10 strategy at Citigroup,
said ""it is becoming increasingly clear that repatriation flows
(to Japan) are not panning out and if anything will be
limited.""
 He said recent Bank of Japan data suggests investors' share
of foreign assets was already low before the quake.
 FED SEEN LAGGING ECB
 A steady rise in U.S. yields gained traction this week as
several Fed policymakers said the central bank would have to
start tightening monetary policy soon to avoid inflation.
 St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a non-voting member
of the Fed's rate-setting committee, said Tuesday the U.S.
economy was strong enough to curtail the Fed's $600 billion
bond-buying program by $100 billion [ID:nLDE72S0RJ].
 That weakened the euro briefly, though it recovered from
$1.4045 to trade up 0.1 percent at $1.4096 .
 But analysts said markets still expect the ECB to beat the
Fed by hiking rates next week and have noted that Fed officials
do not all agree.
 Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, unlike Bullard a
voting member, said late Monday that the Fed should complete
its bond-buying program as planned. [ID:nN28211644]
 ""We do need to see a shift from the Fed (for the dollar to
rally), but not just from the known hawks,"" said Vassili
Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo.
 However, if the euro were to close below $1.3994, an
ascending channel base, that could signal a significant price
correction, said RBC Capital Markets strategist George Davis.
That could expose $1.3754, followed by the February low of
$1.3428, he said.
 On the upside, heavy options-related barriers around
$1.4250 were expected to cap gains, but a break of that level
may see a test of the November high of $1.4283.

 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on
Tuesday on speculation the Federal Reserve might curtail a
program aimed at keeping interest rates low, pulling U.S.
stocks higher, while oil and other key commodities prices also
rose.
 The yen fell the most against the dollar since intervention
by the Bank of Japan and other major central banks to stop
runaway gains in the Japanese currency.
 U.S. Treasuries widened losses after the sale of $35
billion in five-year notes. It was the second of the Treasury's
three auctions of coupons this week, totaling $99 billion.
 The dollar rose against the euro after the president of the
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, James Bullard, told an audience
in Prague the U.S. economy was strong enough for the Fed to
curtail its $600 billion asset purchase program by about $100
billion. For details, see [ID:nLDE72S0RJ].
 The euro hit a session low of $1.4060 versus the dollar on
the EBS trading platform after falling through reported bids at
$1.4080. It last traded at $1.4088 . Traders said
sovereign bids at $1.4050 could limit losses in the single
currency.

 The dollar rose to 82.42 yen  while the euro hit a
10-month high against the yen at 116.08  .

 U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds briefly fell a point in price

Greece's credit-worthiness below that of Egypt, deepening the
debt woes of two of the weakest countries in the euro zone.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2011 03:32PM ET</span>",WRAPUP 3-IAEA suggests Japan widen exclusion zone near nuclear plant," * France's Sarkozy to be first leader to visit since
disaster
 * Japan calls for calm over fears radiation has tainted
exports
 * Decades may be needed to scrap damaged nuclear plant
(Recasts throughout)	
 By Shinichi Saoshiro and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog
suggested Japan consider widening an evacuation zone around a
stricken nuclear plant as French President Nicolas Sarkozy was
due to arrive on Thursday, the first leader to visit since a
devastating earthquake and tsunami sparked the worst nuclear
crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.	
 In the latest sign of widening consequences from the nuclear
crisis, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said
radiation measured at the village of Iitate, 40 km from Japan's
crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, exceeded a criterion
for evacuation.	
 Japan has ordered those within a 20 km (12.4 mile) radius
from the plant to leave and is encouraging those living in a
20-30 km ring to do the same, and if they don't, to stay inside.	
 ""We have advised (Japan) to carefully assess the situation
and they have indicated that it is already under assessment,""
Denis Flory, a deputy director general of the IAEA, said.	
 The finding comes as Sarkozy, who chairs the G20 and G8
blocs of nations, is due to meet his Japanese counterpart, Naoto
Kan, to show support for Japan's efforts to end its nuclear
crisis and rebuild after the March 11 quake and tsunami. 
 
 
 Kan has been criticised by the opposition for not expanding
the evacuation zone. Greenpeace this week said it had confirmed
radiation levels in this village northwest of the plant high
enough to evacuate, but Japan's nuclear safety agency has
rebuffed the environmental group's call. 
 Several countries have banned milk and produce from the
areas near the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, 240 km
(150 miles) north of Tokyo, due to contamination fears. Japan
has itself stopped exports of vegetables and milk from near the
plant, which is leaking radiation. [ID:nL3E7EN0JP]	
 As radiation fears linger, Singapore has told the IAEA that
some cabbages imported from Japan had radiation levels up to
nine times the levels recommended for international trade. 
 While vowing to monitor radioactive contamination to prevent
potential food safety risks and provide the World Trade
Organisation quick and precise information, Japan called on the
world not to impose ""unjustifiable"" import curbs on its goods.	
 ""In return, Japan asked members not to overreact,"" said a
WTO official. 
 While food makes up only 1 percent of Japan's exports, the
tsunami-crippled nuclear plant poses a serious risk to an
economy burdened with huge public debt, an ageing population and
a big bill for rebuilding, possibly topping $300 billion.

 SAFETY UPGRADE 
 Radioactive iodine in the sea off the damaged plant has hit
record levels. The state nuclear safety agency said the amounts
were 3,355 times the legal limit and highly toxic plutonium has
been detected in the soil at the Fukushima Daiichi
plant.	
 As operators struggle to regain control of the damaged
reactors three weeks after the quake and tsunami, smoke was
reported to be coming from a second damaged nuclear plant nearby
on Wednesday. 
 Authorities said an electric distribution board powering a
water pump was the problem and incident would not cause
radiation effect externally.	
 France, the world's most nuclear-dependent country, has
offered help and already flown in experts from its state-owned
nuclear reactor maker Areva . 
 ""The problem which worries TEPCO is water, so we are trying
to see, because they are specialists in the treatment of
radioactive waste, what they could advocate,"" said Areva Chief
Executive Anne Lauvergeon, who arrived in Japan on Wednesday.	
 Japan has ordered an immediate safety upgrade at its 55
nuclear power plants, its first acknowledgement that standards
were inadequate.	
 A Reuters investigation showed Japan and plant operator
Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) repeatedly played down
dangers at its nuclear plants and ignored warnings, including a
2007 tsunami study from the utility's senior safety engineer.
[ID:nL3E7EU0HO]	
 Nuclear plants will now be required by mid-April to deploy
back-up mobile power generators and fire trucks able to pump
water, while beefing up training programmes and manuals.	
 Longer-term solutions such as higher sea walls at nuclear
stations will be considered and Japan will review policy to
encourage renewable energy.	
 
 DECADES TO SCRAP DAMAGED REACTORS	
 The discovery of highly toxic plutonium in soil at Daiichi
this week raised alarm over the disaster, which has overshadowed
the humanitarian calamity triggered by the earthquake and
tsunami, which left more than 27,500 people dead or missing.	
 Anger at Japan's nuclear crisis saw more than 100 people
protest outside the Tokyo headquarters of TEPCO.	
 ""We don't want to use electric power that can kill people,""
said Waseda University student Mina Umeda.	
 But the Japanese government says nuclear power will remain
an integral supplier of power. Before the disaster, Japan's
nuclear reactors provided about 30 percent of the country's
electric power. That had been expected to rise to 50 percent by
2030, among the highest in the world.	
 TEPCO said it was inevitable it would have to scrap four of
its six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.	
 But even just scrapping the damaged nuclear reactors may
take decades , said Hidehiko Nishiyama,
deputy director-general of the Nuclear and Industry Safety
Agency (NISA).	
 ""Even if they decide on scrapping the reactors, water
spraying needs to be continued to prevent the fuels from
overheating, and a sustainable cooling system needs to be
established,"" he said.	
 ""It would be 10 to 20 years before the scrapping process
runs its course."" 
 Jesper Koll, director of equity research at JPMorgan
Securities in Tokyo, said a drawn-out battle to bring the plant
under control and manage the radioactivity being released would
perpetuate uncertainty and act as a drag on the economy.	
 ""The worst-case scenario is that this drags on not one month
or two months or six months, but for two years, or
indefinitely,"" he said. ""Japan will be bypassed. That is the
real nightmare scenario.""	
 Japan's Nikkei index has slid about 9 percent since
the tsunami while TEPCO shares have fallen almost 80 percent. 
 TEPCO will test sprinkling synthetic resin in some areas of
the Daiichi complex to prevent radioactive dust from flying into
the air or being washed into the ocean by rain. The resin is
water-soluble, but when the water evaporates, it becomes sticky
and contains the dust.
    Pollution of the ocean is a serious concern for a country
where fish is central to the diet. Experts say the vastness of
the ocean and a powerful current should dilute high levels of
radiation, limiting the danger of marine contamination.	
 Hundreds of thousands of Japanese whose homes and
livelihoods were wiped away by the tsunami that obliterated
cities on the northeast coast have heard next to nothing from
the government about whether it will help them rebuild.	
 About 173,600 were living in shelters on high ground above
the vast plains of mud-covered debris, with temporary housing
for only a few hundred currently under construction.

 * Minister sees G20 progress on global monetary system
 * Wants China, BRIC states' help in G7 interventions
(Adds quotes and details from wide-ranging interview)
 By Annika Breidthardt
 BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - Germany's finance minister
told Reuters on Tuesday that Ireland must present more savings
measures, as Greece did, if it feels the need to renegotiate
the terms of its bailout from the European Union and IMF.
 ""If Ireland sees the need to renegotiate the conditions,
then, as we told Ireland on March 11, it has to show first what
additional measures it can take itself,"" Wolfgang Schaeuble
told Reuters in an interview en route to China.
 ""Greece did that and therefore was honoured with a change
in the conditions. Ireland hasn't done that so far,"" he said.
""I don't want to criticise, the Irish government has only been
in office shortly, but it is a clear precondition.""
 Ireland's new government has been seeking a reduction in
the interest rate it pays on loans under the 85 billion euro
rescue package it sought late last year to prop up its failing
banks after being frozen out of debt markets.
 ""The ball is now in Ireland's court,"" said the minister. He
would not comment on Germany's proposals that Ireland increase
its low corporate tax rate as a condition for easier terms.
 Another struggling euro zone member, Portugal, was deemed
by the European Union at a March 11 summit to have drawn up
tough enough austerity measures to preclude the need for a
bailout and that assessment had not changed yet, Schaeuble
said.
 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned last week
after parliament failed to endorse his reform programme to cut
the budget deficit.
 ""If Portugal sticks to its commitments, independently of
new elections, that would be the right path,"" said Schaeuble,
whose boss, Angela Merkel, strongly backed Socialist Socrates'
reform package and chided Portugal's parliament for not
supporting him.
 Even so, Schaeuble said, the risk of contagion in the euro
zone had been reduced since one year ago, and there would be no
impact on the stability of Merkel's coalition or its euro-zone
policy from an election setback last weekend in a German
state.
 CHINA, BRIC STATES MUST HELP
 The German minister spoke on his way to a high-level G20
meeting on currency reform and said there would be ""concrete
movements"" on this issue this year, while the group would also
be giving more importance to energy and commodity policy to
help guard against speculation.
 Schaeuble said there would also be a push to help
developing countries build up their capital markets with
adequate rules so they can ""reduce ... dependency on
speculative developments.""
 The German minister said exclusive reliance on the dollar
was ""not especially helpful for the dollar nor for the rest of
the world and a somewhat more balanced situation would
naturally be in everyone's interests.""
 The recent G7 currency intervention to stabilise the
Japanese yen after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis
had proved helpful because of the agility of this mechanism by
a small group of nations, Schaeuble said.
 ""But in the future it would be important for other strong
states to contribute, especially China and the other BRIC
states,"" he said, using the acronym for the fast-developing
economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on
Tuesday on speculation the Federal Reserve might curtail a
program aimed at keeping interest rates low, while U.S. stocks
rose and Treasuries prices fell.
 European shares ended flat after weakness in the banking
sector. World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were
up 0.1 percent after slipping about 0.3 percent earlier.
 U.S. Treasuries widened losses after the sale of $35
billion in five-year notes. It was the second of the Treasury's
three auctions of coupons this week, totaling $99 billion.
 The dollar rose against the euro after the president of the
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, James Bullard, told an audience
in Prague the U.S. economy was strong enough to curtail the
Fed's $600 billion asset purchase program by some $100 billion.
For details, see [ID:nLDE72S0RJ].
 Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece and Portugal's ratings,
citing risks that their debt could be subordinated to any
future European bailout mechanism. The downgrades left Portugal
one notch above junk and Greece's credit-worthiness below that
of Egypt, deepening the debt woes of two of the weakest
countries in the euro zone. [ID:nLDE72S1LY]
 EUROPEAN BOND YIELDS
 Among European bonds, Portugal's 10- and 2-year yields
jumped to euro lifetime highs and Greece's 2-year yields rose
10 basis points to 15.46 percent following the S&P downgrade.
 U.S. stocks rose on strength in large-cap technology shares
after falling a day earlier on the lowest volume for 2011.
 ""The quarter is ending with a lot of uncertainties out
there,"" said Michael Shaoul, chairman of the New York-based
Marketfield Asset Management, which oversees $973 million.
 ""There's nothing obvious about what investors need to do in
this environment, and that's why you're seeing such low
volume,"" he said. ""No one has any reason to recommit capital.""
 Wall Street remained cautious over crises in Japan and the
Middle East and north Africa.
 But Amazon.com Inc  was up almost 3 percent,
hovering near $174, after it introduced a service offering
remote access to music.
 Cisco Systems  rose more than 1.0 percent to trade

for an undisclosed amount to boost its cloud computing
services.[ID:nL3E7ET0TS] [ID:nN29243506]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 64.48
points, or 0.5 percent, at 12,262.36. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> was up 5.52 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,315.71.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 17.99 points, or 0.7
percent, at 2,748.67. [.N]
 European banking shares had pushed world stocks lower after
a surprise capital increase by an Italian bank.
 The announcement by Italy's UBI Banca's  of a 1
billion euro ($1.4 billion) capital hike dragged down Italian
banks on speculation that other lenders could be heading down
the same road. UBI shares fell more than 12 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed up 0.04 percent at 1,125.94 points.
 The euro hit a session low of $1.4060 on the EBS trading
platform after falling through reported bids at $1.4080. It
last traded at $1.4088 . Traders said reported sovereign
bids at $1.4050 could limit losses in the single currency,
however.
 UNCERTAINTY FOR COMMODITIES
 The dollar and euro both reached their highest levels
against the yen since March 18 when the Bank of Japan and
others intervened to stop yen gains.
 The dollar rose to 82.42 yen  while the euro hit a
10-month high against the yen above 116.03  .
 In commodity markets, uncertainty over Libya drove up the
price of oil as government troops halted a rebel advance aimed
at restoring oil exports from the OPEC member.
 Analysts said unrest in the Middle East was lending broad
support to oil and other commodities while Japan's nuclear
crisis posed growth worries over demand for raw materials
.
 ""We have two factors that are countervailing,"" said Harry
Tchilinguirian, analyst at BNP Paribas.
 ""There is a risk premium in the Middle East built in on
risk of further contagion. On the other hand we have the fact
Japan is a major component of the global supply chain, so the
potential for a price correction in the second quarter
remains.""

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2011 02:08PM ET</span>",U.S. sanctions Belarusian company for Iran ties," WASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - The United States said on
Tuesday it had imposed sanctions on Belarusneft, a state-owned
Belarussian energy company, for its involvement in the Iranian
petroleum sector.
 The United States suspects Iran of seeking to develop
nuclear weapons under cover of its civil atomic program. Iran
denies this, saying its nuclear program is solely to produce
energy so that it can export more of its valuable oil and gas.
 Major powers have tightened sanctions on Iran via the U.N.
Security Council and unilateral steps to try to pressure Tehran
to meet U.N. demands that it halt sensitive nuclear work and
provide more information about its atomic program.
 The U.S. State Department said Belarusneft had entered into
a $500 million contract with NaftIran Intertrade company in
2007 for the development of Iran's Jofeir oilfield.
 The Iran Sanctions Act requires sanctions be imposed on
firms that make certain investments over $20 million in Iran.
 State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. move
bars Belarusneft from receiving aid from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank, from obtaining U.S. government export licenses, from
getting private U.S. bank loans of more than $10 million in any
12-month period and from winning U.S. government contracts.
 The spokesman said he was not aware of Belarusneft having
any such loans or any intent of getting into the U.S. market
but he said the sanctions would prevent it from doing so in the
future and deter other companies from Iranian investments.
 ""They limit the company's ability to access the U.S. market
and, even if they don't have any U.S. commercial activities at
present, they will limit their options to operate in the U.S.
in the future,"" Toner told reporters at his daily briefing.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - The yen slid to
post-intervention lows on Tuesday and analysts anticipate more
losses if the spread between U.S. and Japanese yields continues
to widen and if repatriation flows into Japan fail to emerge.
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 0.81 percent, eight
basis points above Friday's close and up 18 basis points in six
days, widening its gap over comparable Japanese yields.
 The wider spread helped the dollar reached its highest
levels against the yen since March 18, when the Bank of Japan
and other major central banks intervened to stop runaway yen
gains.
 ""While there are no obvious catalysts for the yen's moves,
we suspect that the combination of recent equity market
resilience and higher U.S. Treasury yields is weighing on the
Japanese currency,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency
strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York.
The dollar rose to 82.48 yen while the euro was last at
116.08 yen, a 10-month high.
""There are a lot of yen negatives right now,"" said Steven
Englander, head of G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 ""First, the rate differential between U.S. and Japanese
yields has widened, working in the dollar's favor,"" he said.
""Second, it is becoming increasingly clear that repatriation
flows (to Japan) are not panning out and if anything will be
limited.""
 The yen hit a record high against the dollar during the
week following Japan's massive earthquake and tsunami, largely
due to expectations investors would repatriate funds from
overseas back into Japan.
 CitiFX said there are several reasons why repatriation
flows should be limited, one of which is that Japanese
households are still accumulating foreign assets.
 Japanese firms also appear to have enough funds to deal
with the costs of rebuilding.
 ""Life insurance companies can cope with payments because of
their cash holdings. Casualty insurance companies may encounter
some difficulty but government reinsurance should cover the
payments,"" the firm said in a research note.
 Also, pension funds and retail investors need not raise yen
cash and repatriate.
 ""Japanese banks will meet huge loan demand in the area,
whereas the government is to increase JGB issuance. The BOJ
(Bank of Japan) will be obliged to embark upon further monetary
easing,"" the firm said.
 CitiFX said this policy mix could be negative for the yen
in the medium and long run.
 FED SEEN LAGGING ECB
 The dollar rose against the euro early on Tuesday after
St. Louis Federal Reserve bank President James Bullard told an
audience in Prague the U.S. economy was strong enough to
curtail the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program by $100
billion.
 The program, aimed at keeping interest rates low to bolster
the economy, has been widely deemed a bane for the dollar on
views it is tantamount to printing money.
 But the dollar's gains versus the single currency were
short lived, as many expect the European Central Bank to
tighten policy well before the Fed.
 The euro hit a session low of $1.4060 on the EBS trading
platform after falling through reported bids at $1.4080. It
last traded nearly unchanged at $1.4084.
 The euro has retreated from a 4 1/2-month high of $1.4249
hit last week, but has been supported on the view the ECB may
raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on April 7.
 The $1.40 level is supported by a trendline drawn from the
low below $1.30 hit in January, while the euro's 21-day moving
average stands just above that level, at around $1.4006.
 On the upside, heavy options-related barriers around
$1.4250 were expected to cap gains. A break of that level may
see a test of the November high of $1.4283.

 * Rates must rise over time to keep prices stable mid-term
 * Urges parliament to pass tighter bank regulation 
 
 (adds details background)
 ZURICH, March 29 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc's surge against
the dollar limits the Swiss central bank's leeway to raise
interest rates, Swiss National Bank vice-chairman Thomas Jordan
said in a newspaper interview.
 However, Jordan indicated that resuming market interventions
was not on the cards because the global economic outlook was
much better than in 2009 and early 2010, when the SNB sold
billions of francs to stem the currency's rise.
 ""We are concerned. The (franc's) rise is tightening monetary
conditions and that limits our room for manoeuvre in normalising
interest rates,"" Jordan told twice-weekly business newspaper
Finanz und Wirtschaft when asked about the dollar's decline.
 The franc is trading around 0.92 per dollar, not too far off
an all-time high of 0.8963 hit in the wake of this month's
devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
 The Swiss currency's strength has been the key reason for
the central bank to keep borrowing costs at ultra-low levels,
despite a brighter growth outlook.
 The SNB raised its growth forecast to around 2 percent at
its quarterly meeting on March 17 but warned against risks from
the disaster in Japan, the debt crisis in the euro zone and the
turmoil in the middle east.
 Jordan said that while monetary conditions were appropriate
overall, interest rates were at a ""comfortable"" level for the
domestic economy while exporters faced a big challenge from the
franc's strength.
 ""Monetary policy will certainly have to become more
restrictive over time in order to ensure price stability in the
medium-term,"" Jordan said.
 The SNB was not pursuing an exchange rate target. ""But the
exchange rate is an important indicator for interest rate
policy,"" he said. ""A strong franc dampens the economy and
inflation. We take that into account.""
 
 TOUGHER BANK RULES
 Financial markets currently price in a first post-crisis
interest rate hike for September.<0#FES:>
 However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its
recent assessment of the Swiss economy that the central bank
should be in a position to tighten borrowing costs in the
near-term, barring any more shocks. [ID:nLDE72R13M]
 Jordan repeated the SNB's recent stance that currency
interventions were not warranted given the better economic
outlook. But the SNB retained the option to intervene, should
the economic developments call for it, he added.
 The SNB vice-chairman, who is also in charge of financial
stability at the central bank, called on parliament to rapidly
approve proposed ""too big to fail"" legislation, aimed at
ensuring that the collapse of a big bank would not pull down the
whole economy.
 ""Only when the rules are fully in force would the risk to
taxpayers be significantly reduced,"" Jordan said.
 The rules Switzerland is proposing would require banks like
UBS   and Credit Suisse   to hold
more capital than the new international standards known as Basel
III. [ID:nLDE6BL11E]
 The country's political parties all agree that tougher rules
are needed but have criticised parts of the proposals. The
government is expected to issue a formal message to parliament
soon and it is possible that a law could be passed this year.

1227,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2011 12:52PM ET</span>",Brussels think-tank calls for yuan inclusion in SDR," BRUSSELS, March 29 (Reuters) - An overhaul of the global
monetary system by the world's top 20 economies should entail a
bigger role for the IMF's SDR reserve asset and the inclusion of
China's renminbi in the Special Drawing Rights, the influential
Brussels-based Bruegel think tank said.
 In a paper by the Bruegel's head Jean Pisany-Ferry, Agnes
Benassy-Quere of France's CEPII think tank and Yu Yongding, a
former academic adviser to China's central bank, the three
economists said the overhaul should also include international
monitoring of exchange rates and stronger financial safety nets.
 The call comes before G20 finance ministers and central
bankers meet in mid-April in Washington, where the international
monetary system will be one of the topics discussed.
 A basket of four currencies -- the dollar, euro, pound
sterling and Japanese yen -- make up the International Monetary
Fund's Special Drawing Rights which can be used as an
international reserve asset.
 Created in 1969, SDRs do not reflect the rise of China to
become the second biggest economy in the world after the United
States.
 The world's 20 biggest developing and developed economies,
the G20, are discussing ways to overhaul the global monetary
system to adjust it to changing realities and prevent economic
and financial crises.
 The three economists said there was little chance of a grand
redesign of the monetary system in the short term, but concrete
steps should still be taken. G20 leaders will meet to discuss
the issue in France in November.
 ""First, consensus is needed on exchange rates, capital flows
and reserves. This consensus is closer than often assumed, and
should be codified in some form of soft law, with provisions for
surveillance agreed on,"" the economists said.
 ""Second, financial safety nets must be improved so that
countries do not have to self-insure by accumulating reserves.
The least difficult route could be a new regime for deciding on
Special Drawing Right allocations that would facilitate more
frequent use of this instrument,"" they said.
 ""Third, a change in the composition of the SDR should be
planned for, to strengthen the multilateral framework by
including the renminbi. These reforms would be a partial move,
and would prepare the ground for further developments.""
 Many G20 countries would like to see the Chinese currency
included in the SDR basket as a way of better engaging China in
global economic governance, but not before Beijing allows the
exchange rate of the mow managed currency to be set by the
market. 
 A free float of the yuan would entail its appreciation and
China is reluctant to allow this to happen too quickly for fear
of killing off its vibrant exports sector.
 ""We suggest adapting the existing SDR to the new global
environment through more frequent allocations, and by planning
the inclusion of the renminbi in the SDR basket in the context
of an opening up of China's financial account and a move towards
a flexible exchange-rate regime in China,"" the paper said.
 The three economists also said the role of the SDRs, of
which there are 204 billion currently in issue ($318 billion),
should be expanded with more allocations of the asset to IMF
members.
 ""They would provide countries with SDR reserves that they
could exchange for reserves denominated in the currency of their
choice,"" the paper said. 
 ""If provided in limited volumes and in response to
increases in the demand for reserves only, such allocations
would be unlikely to have far-reaching consequences for global
liquidity while providing a welcome buffer for vulnerable
countries,"" the economists said.

 * Purchases already near previous season target
 * Next season output could reach 900,000 tonnes
 
 (Adds details, quotes including on syndicated loan plans)
 By Kwasi Kpodo
 ACCRA, March 29 (Reuters) - Cocoa output from Ghana, the
world's second-largest grower of the key ingredient in
chocolate, is running nearly 43 percent higher than in the last
season, according to official data released on Tuesday.
 The boost could ease the impact of supply disruptions from
top grower Ivory Coast, where a post-election standoff has
triggered fighting between the forces of two claimants for the
presidency.
 Declared purchases by private cocoa buyers to Ghana's
industry regulator Cocobod -- the best indication of output from
the West African state -- reached 734,150 tonnes by March 17
from the start of the season in October.
 That is up 42.6 percent over the same period last year and
also well above the roughly 632,000 tonnes produced during the
full 2009-10 season, the data from Cocobod showed.
 Cocobod said this month it had raised its target for
full-season purchases to a record 850,000 tonnes from 750,000,
citing favourable weather and improved husbandry.
 Analysts have said the escalating conflict in Ivory Coast
could pad the Ghanaian figures by spurring massive cross-border
smuggling, though Ghanaian officials have said they have seen
only limited volumes of smuggled beans so far. Ghana is
hoping to further raise its cocoa production to 1 million tonnes
per year by the 2012-13 season and may be able to hit between
850,000-900,000 tonnes during the 2011-12 season, Cocobod Deputy
Chief Executive Yaw Adu-Ampomah said on Tuesday.
 ""We could get very close to the 1 million target,"" he said,
adding that an official forecast for 2011-12 was not yet ready.
 He said Cocobod expected to raise $2 billion through
syndicated loans in September to fund next season's cocoa crop
purchases.
 Some 7,544 tonnes of purchases were recorded in Ghana during
the week to March 17, the 24th of the 33-week main crop,
according to the Cocobod data, marking a decline from 11,917
tonnes the week before.
 Increased output from Ghana could help offset supply losses
from Ivory Coast, which have raised fears of tight supply and
have pushed up cocoa futures prices.
 Cocoa arrivals to Ivory Coast's ports have ground to a
virtual halt due to an export ban, while traders and farmers
complain that rising stockpiles in warehouses there are at risk
of rotting.

 * Tax on foreign borrowing not seen hurting real
 * Brazil real firms 0.24 pct, Mexico peso flat
 By Silvio Cascione and Michael O'Boyle
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, March 29 (Reuters) - Brazil's real
on Tuesday shrugged off the government's latest effort to
curb financial flows that have inflated the currency's value,
although authorities could step up efforts.
 Brazil's government on Tuesday raised a tax on foreign
borrowing for loans of up to 360 days. But the move had been
widely expected by financial markets. Some had feared the
government could take more drastic measures.
 ""This measure will not make any difference,"" said Flavio
Serrano, senior economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank.
 The real firmed 0.24 percent to 1.656 per dollar on the
local spot market.
 The country's finance minister called a press conference
for after 1530 GMT.
 Financial flows into Brazil have been tempted by the huge
spread between interest rates in developed markets and
Brazil's double-digit rates.
 In October, Brazil tripled to 6 percent the so-called IOF
tax it charges foreigners when they buy local bonds.
 But analysts said the lack of a tax on locals was allowing
domestic banks and companies to borrow abroad, invest in
Brazil's high-yielding debt and pocket the difference between
interest rates.
 Analysts said market players would likely find ways around
any new measures, short of a broad flat tax on all inflows.
 ""We are skeptical that this new measure will change the
trend of (the real's) appreciation,"" Barclays Capital wrote in
a note to clients.
 Barclays noted much of current and future inflows would
likely be related to equity investments, which are only taxed
at a rate of 2 percent.
 The real has firmed about 5 percent from a November low
despite increased government and central bank efforts.
However, analysts said the government could try more measures
if the real firms back past 1.65 per dollar.
 Mexico's peso traded flat around 11.9750 per dollar. The
cost of dollars in pesos could not push through support at
11.95 per dollar, and pulled back after weak data in the
United States, Mexico's top trade partner.
 Data showed U.S. consumer confidence fell in March as
households worried about inflation, while home prices fell for
the seventh straight month in January, pointing to a loss in
momentum in the economy.
 Mexico's peso hit its strongest in nearly 2-1/2 years this
month on signs of recovery in the United States, which buys
most of Mexico's exports.
 Chile's peso bid 0.33 percent weaker to 481.90 per dollar,
hurt by a fall in the price of copper, the country's main
export.
 Peru's sol edged back after it slumped by the most in
nearly two years in the previous session following polls that
showed a left-wing nationalist presidential candidate leading
the race.
 The sol firmed a slight 0.07 percent to 2.811 per dollar
as it edged back from its weakest close since December in the
prior session.

 * Party had been big backer of keeping plants open
 * FDP is junior partner in Merkel's coalition
 
 (Recasts with background, quotes and reactions)
 By Thorsten Severin
 BERLIN, March 29 (Reuters) - Germany's Free Democrats,
junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, said on
Tuesday they want to shut down permanently seven older nuclear
plants temporarily idled after Japan's nuclear disaster.
 The liberal FDP had been a driving force behind a law to
extend the use of nuclear power. Deputy leader Christian Lindner
announced the U-turn after the coalition lost power in a state
vote on Sunday where the anti-nuclear Greens won record support.
 Germany has a total of 17 reactors. Merkel's centre-right
government passed legislation last year to extend the lifespan
of the 17 by an average of 12 years beyond a previous 2022
cut-off date. The FDP has been strongly pro-nuclear until now.
 ""We've got to reach an agreement with the utilities in which
the old reactors won't be put back on line,"" said Lindner,
tipped as the possible next FDP chairman if Foreign Minister
Guido Westerwelle relinquishes the party leadership. 
 ""We want to move quickly to change the energy policies.""
 While other leaders in Merkel's Christian Democrats added
their voice to a chorus calling for Germany to make a quicker
exit from nuclear power, some conservatives such as
parliamentary whip Volker Kauder remained firmly opposed.
 ""We're going to go further than even the Social Democrats
and Greens could ever imagine,"" said another senior CDU
lawmaker, Norbert Barthle, referring to the centre-left parties
that passed a 2000 law to phase out nuclear power by 2022.
 Merkel said on Monday her view on nuclear energy had changed
after Japan's earthquake triggered a nuclear crisis, but she did
not say concretely if the existing law would be changed.
 Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen, however, said Germany
should shut its nuclear reactors faster than planned because the
loss on Sunday of the conservative stronghold Baden-Wuerttemberg
-- in a vote where Japan's nuclear disaster played a major role
-- showed the public wanted a quicker exit.
 Merkel's government last year scrapped the law passed by the
red-green coalition even though polls showed most Germans
opposed that policy shift.
 But after the Japanese nuclear disaster, Merkel retreated
and declared a three-month moratorium on the extensions.
 She also temporarily shut seven nuclear plants built before
1980. The policy flip-flop upset her party's business wing and
failed to impress voters in Baden-Wuerttemberg, some of whom saw
it as an election ploy.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Tuesday
after a top Federal Reserve official said the central bank's
asset purchase plan should be curtailed, but analysts said the
dollar would remain under pressure on views the Fed would lag
other monetary authorities in tightening policy.
 The dollar was up sharply versus the yen, which retreated
to post-intervention lows, and was trading little changed
against the euro after initially rising on comments by St.
Louis Federal Reserve bank President James Bullard.
Bullard told an audience in Prague the U.S. economy was
strong enough to curtail the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying
program by $100 billion..
 The program, aimed at keeping interest rates low to bolster
the economy, has been widely deemed a bane for the dollar on
views it is tantamount to printing money.
 The euro hit a session low of $1.4060 on the EBS trading
platform after falling through reported bids at $1.4080. It
last traded at $1.4088. Traders said reported sovereign bids at
$1.4050 could limit losses in the single currency, however.
 Views the European Central Bank would tighten before the
Fed also supported the euro.
 ""Euro/dollar is trading at the moment on two factors --
interest rate differentials and the technical configuration,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.
 ""The euro failed to break below $1.40 yesterday, and last
week it disappointed on the upside, failing to test the
November highs (at $1.4283), so it is likely to stay in a
$1.40-$1.42 range"".
 The euro has retreated from a 4 1/2-month high of $1.4249
hit last week, but has been supported on the view the ECB may
raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on April 7.
 The $1.40 level is supported by a trendline drawn from the
low below $1.30 hit in January, while the euro's 21-day moving
average stands just above that level, at around $1.4006.
 On the upside, heavy options-related barriers around
$1.4250 were expected to cap gains. A break of that level may
see a test of the November high of $1.4283.
 One-month euro/dollar implied vol traded around 9.9 percent
on Tuesday, near its lowest level in roughly a year.
 YEN AT POST-INTERVENTION LOWS
 Meanwhile, the dollar and euro both reached their highest
levels against the yen since March 18, when the Bank of Japan
and other major central banks intervened to stop runaway yen
gains.
 ""There are a lot of yen negatives right now,"" said Steven
Englander, head of G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 ""First, the rate differential between U.S. and Japanese
yields has widened, working in the dollar's favor,"" he said.
""Second, it is becoming increasingly clear that repatriation
flows (to Japan) are not panning out and if anything will be
limited.""
 The dollar rose to high of 82.42 yen on trading platform
EBS.
 Solid support should continue to underpin it at 81.30,
Monday's low, and this should stem near-term corrections,
according to IFR Markets, a Thomson Reuters service.
 The rise in the U.S. currency versus the yen has quelled
speculation of further Japanese intervention. Many in the
market anticipate a fall to around 80 yen or lower will be
required for Tokyo to re-enter the market to sell the Japanese
currency.
 The euro, meanwhile, rose to 115.86 yen. It was on course
to test 116.03, above which would mark a 10-month high.
 IFR Markets showed that euro/yen continues the recovery
from 113.56, last Thursday's low and breaking above 115.56, the
March 18 high, would unlock 116.00, the 2011 high posted on
March 4.

(Adds AB InBev comment)
 BRUSSELS, March 29 (Reuters) - A European Union court must
review its decision to ban Anheuser-Busch InBev from using the
""Bud"" trademark in the European Union after mistakes in the
ruling, the EU's top court ruled on Tuesday.
 The European Court of Justice referred the case back to the
General Court -- the second highest in the European Union --
arguing that the latter made three errors of law in its December
2008 ruling.
 AB InBev has been in a long-running dispute with Czech
brewer Budejovicky Budvar over the rights to the trademark names
""Budweiser"" and ""Bud"" -- a David versus Goliath litigation that
has run on and off for a century.
 Budvar had argued that its 'Bud' was a protected brand in
Austria, France, Italy and Portgal, preventing AB InBev from
registering the trademark throughout the European Union.
 The top court on Tuesday said this was only the case if a
sign or trademark was actually used significantly in the course
of trade, something the lower court had not taken into account.
 AB InBev, which owns the rights to Budweiser or Bud
trademarks in 23 of the 27 EU states and launched Bud in Russia
last year, said it welcomed Tuesday's verdict.
 ""As a result of the ruling, we are confident that we will
obtain an EU-wide registration for Bud,"" the company said in an
emailed response.
 Last July, the European court ruled that AB InBev could not
register ""Budweiser"" as a trademark in the bloc.
 AB InBev has said the July ruling would have no effect on
its business.

* ""Novel food"" rules to be redrawn after 3 years of talks

(Adds quotes from EU consumer commissioner, diplomat)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, March 29 (Reuters) - Talks within the European
Union broke down on Tuesday over how to deal with food from
cloned animals, sending EU proposals on the sale of new types of
foods back to the drawing board after three years of debate.
 The failure to reach an agreement means EU rules on cloning
and on so-called ""novel foods"" -- defined as foodstuffs not
consumed significantly in the EU before 1997 -- must now be
redrafted and could take several years to agree.
 ""This was the pity of not coming to an agreement, because
the present situation -- where there is no control at all on
cloning techniques or clones -- will be again the rule in
Europe,"" EU consumer commissioner John Dalli told reporters.
 Following all-night negotiations in Brussels, EU lawmakers
were ready to drop their demand for a ban on the sale of food
from the conventionally bred offspring of cloned animals, in
return for mandatory labelling for all such products.
 But EU governments said that would risk dragging the
27-nation bloc into a ""full blown trade war"" with countries that
export goods derived from the young of cloned animals, such as
the United States.
 ""The European Parliament ... tried to push the (European)
Council to accept a misleading, unfeasible 'solution' that in
practice would have required drawing a family tree for each
slice of cheese or salami,"" said Hungary's farm minister Sandor
Fazakas.
 Hungary, which chaired the showdown talks as holder of the
EU's rotating presidency, said it had been ready to accept a ban
on cloning for food production in Europe and ""the gradual
introduction of labelling"" for products from the offspring of
clones, starting with beef.
 A Brussels-based diplomat from a non-EU country told Reuters
the failure of the talks was good for states that export meat
and other products to Europe.
 ""We are happy about the current situation because it keeps
the status quo. Parliament's position would have had very hard
consequences for international trade,"" the diplomat said.
 
 CONSUMER CONCERNS
 The European Parliament's negotiators in the talks accused
EU governments of ignoring public opinion, citing a 2008
consumer survey that showed that 58 percent of Europeans
believed cloning should never be used for food production.
 ""We made a huge effort to compromise, but we were not
willing to betray consumers on their right to know whether food
comes from animals bred using clones,"" lawmakers Gianni Pittella
and Kartika Liotard said in a joint statement.
 The use of cloning for food production is not currently
believed to be widespread in Europe, but Denmark is the only EU
country to have banned the practice, and the lack of EU rules
means there is a dearth of reliable data on its use.
 The United States is the most advanced country in terms of
cloning for food production, with estimates provided by
companies suggesting that ""thousands of cattle"" and ""hundreds of
pigs"" have been cloned there so far.
 The United States currently has a voluntary moratorium on
the marketing of food from cloned animals but not from their
offspring.
 Animal cloning, which uses DNA transfer to create an exact
genetic copy of an animal, currently has a success rate below 20
percent, with most cloned animals dying during or shortly after
birth.
 The technique is complex and costly, ensuring that cloned
animals are unlikely to be used themselves as food, but they can
be bred traditionally to produce offspring that share similar
traits, such as high milk production or rapid growth.
 The EU's executive -- the European Commission -- said it
would reflect on the failure of the talks before deciding
whether to redraft rules on cloning and on novel foods, which
includes the approval and labelling of nanotechnology in foods.

 By David Milliken and Keith Weir
 LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Britain's economy suffered its
sharpest contraction since mid-2009 late last year, despite
shrinking slightly less than previously estimated, according to
figures that highlight the uncertain nature of its recovery.
 Economists said Tuesday's final estimate for fourth-quarter
GDP data confirmed a weak start point for Britain as the
government sets major spending cuts in train and Bank of England
policymakers argue over whether to raise interest rates to
tackle above-target inflation.
 However, it is first-quarter economic data next month that
will be key in clearing up whether the fall in gross domestic
product was a one-off exacerbated by the coldest December in 100
years, or the start of a longer period of sub-par growth.
 The Office for National Statistics said GDP fell by 0.5
percent in the last three months of 2010 -- the same as its
initial estimate in January but a slightly smaller fall than a
revised estimate of 0.6 percent made last month.
 Heavy snow knocked 0.5 percent off output, the ONS said, and
some economists say the looming public spending cuts are already
prompting retrenchment by households and businesses reliant on
government jobs and contracts.
 The fourth-quarter economic contraction makes Britain an
outlier among other major developed economies, including those
such as the United States, Germany and France which also
suffered harsh winter weather but managed to grow.
 ""It's still a pretty lacklustre backdrop and that probably
sets the tone for the first half of this year,"" said Ross
Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 Year-on-year, fourth-quarter GDP growth was unrevised at 1.5
percent, in line with economists' forecasts.
 Share prices pared losses after the data, but there was
little reaction from sterling or the government bond market.
 ""The figures generally have relatively few implications for
monetary policy,"" said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec.
 
 BOE DILEMMA
 The weak data has cast doubt on whether Britain's economic
recovery is back on track after the deepest recession since at
least World War Two, as under normal circumstances GDP should
grow by just over 0.5 percent a quarter.
 With inflation more than double its target at 4.4 percent,
three BoE policymakers argued last month that rate rises were
overdue, and that delaying risked creating a wage-price spiral.
 But the six other members of the BoE's Monetary Policy
Committee were worried about dismal consumer morale and
spending, and that wage growth was likely to remain tepid.
 Tuesday's GDP data showed that household spending fell by
0.3 percent in real terms in the last three months of 2010, its
biggest drop since the depths of the recession in 2009.
 For 2010 as a whole, household disposable income suffered
its biggest real-terms fall since 1977.
 Separate Bank of England data also released on Tuesday
showed a bigger-than-expected rise in mortgage approvals and the
amount of consumer lending, though both remained well below
pre-recession averages.
 The ONS data showed that both the services sector and the
construction sector suffered their biggest contractions since
the second quarter of 2009, though the declines were less steep
than the ONS had earlier estimated. 
 Industrial output grew at its fastest pace since the second
quarter of 2010, but this did not stop Britain recording its
biggest goods trade deficit since records began in 1955.
 Economists at Citi said that some of the sharp rise in
imports could have been due to businesses increasing inventories
before a rise in sales tax took effect at the start of 2011.
 Both the BoE and the government have forecast that British
exports should recover strongly in time, given that sterling
suffered its steepest fall in trade-weighted terms since the
1930s during 2007 and 2008.
 However, the opposition Labour Party said Tuesday's data
reinforced its view that the government should scale back plans
to cut spending -- which currently aim to largely eliminate a
budget deficit of over 10 percent of GDP over the next 4 years.

 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, March 29 (Reuters) - The United States dealt a heavy
blow to struggling global trade talks on Tuesday, saying the
race to produce a working deal text by Easter could do ""more
harm than good"".
 The negotiations are aimed at opening up world trade for the
benefit of all nations, but they are stalled on a series of
sticking points over tariffs, subsidies and market access.
 ""Texts are an important tool, but if we don't quickly solve
some of the problems we are encountering in our work, we will
have to reassess whether tabling new texts in late April risks
more harm than good,"" said Michael Punke, U.S. Ambassador to the
World Trade Organisation (WTO), in a meeting aimed at completing
a full deal by year-end and a working text in less than a month.
 U.S. disputes with China constitute some of the main factors
holding up a deal in the so-called Doha round. But WTO Director
General Pascal Lamy has pressed ahead with a plan to have a text
ready by Easter for government ministers to discuss.
 China and the United States, however, were as far apart as
ever at the end of this informal session of the WTO's Trade
Negotiations Committee, which has special responsibility for the
decade-old Doha talks and reports to the WTO's General Council.
 The United States repeated demands for zero tariffs on
certain industrial good imports. China said such a move would
cover more than half its imports in that sector and ""goes beyond
the capacity of a developing nation,"" delegates said.
 Punke expressed the reasons for his concerns about a new
text to reporters after the meeting. ""Any text should come from
the members and should not be imposed,"" he said -- a reference
to fears that the WTO chief and chairmen of negotiating groups
might produce a compromise text that they have devised.
 He said his position was widely supported in the room.
 Lamy insisted that he and the chairmen of key working groups
were ""committed to working in a bottom-up way.""
 India was among the countries that later confirmed support
for the U.S. position, saying it would object to any text
showing ""imagination by chairs.""
 
 ""ZOMBIE"" ROUND AND ""FRAMING FAILURE""
 On Monday a U.S. business group said the chances of reaching
a Doha deal this year were fading fast unless world leaders
became personally involved.
 One delegate taking a break from the meeting said he doubted
success this year, but that saving face for the WTO was
important. ""It will be about how failure is framed,"" he said.
 Another, speaking after the meeting had ended, raised the
prospect of a ""zombie"" round of talks continuing for years into
the future and going nowhere.
 Lamy gave delegates in the meeting one of his starkest
warnings yet that time was running out for Doha.
 ""With less than a month to go (to Easter) are we on track to
meet this target?"" he said in a text of his statement released
by the WTO. ""In all honesty I must tell you we are not.""
 Lamy has repeatedly said progress is too slow.
 Diplomats say a deal this year is crucial because elections
in some key countries, including the United States, could raise
obstacles in 2012 and because the talks are already years late
in reaching a conclusion.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - The euro struggled to hold
gains against the dollar on Tuesday, as expectations for a euro
zone interest rate rise were offset by a Federal Reserve warning
about keeping U.S. monetary policy loose for too long.
 The euro rose to around $1.4150 before retreating as traders
took profits on its gains after Fed President James Bullard said
the U.S. central bank may normalise monetary policy before
global uncertainties are resolved. [ID:nLDE72S0RJ]
 Further comments about a possible cut to the Fed's second
round of quantitative easing pushed the euro to a session low,
although bids around $1.4050, including those from sovereign
names, were seen limiting further near-term losses.
The euro has retreated from a 4 1/2-month high of $1.4249
hit last week, but has been supported on the view the European
Central Bank may raise interest rates as early as next month.
 Comments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on Monday
bolstered this view as he said inflation was ""durably"" above the
central bank's target. [ID:nLDE72R20A]
 ""Euro/dollar is trading at the moment on two factors --
interest rate differentials and the technical configuration,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.
 ""The euro failed to break below $1.40 yesterday, and last
week it disappointed on the upside, failing to test the November
highs (at $1.4283), so it is likely to stay in a $1.40-$1.42
range"".
 The euro  was a touch lower on the day at $1.4060. It
pushed through bids seen around $1.4080, but hovered above a low
of $1.4021 hit on Monday.
 The $1.40 level is supported by a trendline drawn from the
low below $1.30 hit in January, while the euro's 21-day moving
average stands just above that level, at around $1.4006. 
 On the upside, heavy options-related barriers around $1.4250
were expected to cap gains. A break of that level may see a test
of the November high of $1.4283.
 Many in the market argued the euro would likely stick to the
$1.40-$1.4250 range ahead of U.S. payrolls data due on Friday,
while low implied volatility levels suggested a break-out on
either side was unlikely in the near term.
 One-month euro/dollar implied vol  traded around
9.9 percent on Tuesday, near its lowest level in roughly a year.
 ""One-month (vol), which still covers the post-Easter lull,
remains reasonably offered,"" Citi analysts said in a note. ""We
feel that it is hard to see it pop with everyone keen to jump on
the selling bandwagon whenever it does start moving higher.""

 RATE OUTLOOK SUPPORT
 Investors continued to focus on the prospect of higher rates
and shrugged off the euro zone debt crisis, despite rising
concerns about Portugal's ability to finance itself as the
country prepares for a snap election. [ID:nLDE72R1RI]
 The euro also rose 0.5 percent against the yen  to
around 115.64 yen, its highest level since Group of Seven
central banks intervened jointly at Japan's request to curb the
yen's appreciation following a devastating earthquake. It was on
course to test 116.03, above which would mark a 10-month high.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.10 yen , with
traders citing demand from UK and European banks. Gains were
capped by offers, including those from Japanese exporters,
around 82.00 yen. Further up, orders were seen around 82.50 and
83.00.
 The rise in the U.S. currency versus the yen has quelled
speculation of further Japanese intervention. Many in the market
anticipate a fall to around 80 yen or lower will be required for
Tokyo to re-enter the market to sell the Japanese currency.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the U.S. currency's
performance against a basket of major currencies, edged up 0.2
percent to 76.298.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2011 07:48AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-In new Egypt and Tunisia, some buyers return"," * Egypt, Tunisian stocks attracting attention
 * Companies associated with old regimes under pressure
 * Wariness stretching to other protest-hit markets
 
 By Carolyn Cohn and Sujata Rao
 LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Egypt and
Tunisia are starting to lure back foreign investors after the
ousting of decades-old autocratic regimes, but some blue-chip
shares could struggle because of links to previous governments.
 While conflict and protest continue to hit countries in the
Middle East and North Africa from Libya to Syria, these markets
have traditionally not attracted large international portfolio
flows, due to underdeveloped markets or lack of foreign access.
 Economies like Egypt and Tunisia, however, were increasingly
a favourite with emerging market investors prior to regime
change, and investors and investors who fled during the
countries' revolutions are now looking for ways to get back in.
 Fund tracker EPFR estimates around $80 million left
dedicated Middle East and North Africa funds this year.
 Egypt opened its stock exchange last week for the first time
in nearly eight weeks, following the downfall of President Hosni
Mubarak. The reopening headed off worries that Egypt could be
ejected from the MSCI emerging equities index, used as a
benchmark by many emerging market investors.
 Before its closure and after it reopened,"" Cairo, the
region's most liquid and biggest bourse, saw a big cash exodus.
Its main index fell to a two-year low last week, with 2011
losses reaching 30 percent.
 Tunisia's market has closed twice for several days at a
time, after the ousting of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in
January. State telecoms operator Tunisie Telecom was forced to
postpone a planned listing in Paris and Tunis.
 But the tide could be turning; on Sunday, Cairo posted its
first gain since mass protests erupted on Jan 25, and markets
rose again on Monday. 
 Tunis fell 20 percent this year up until the second closure
on Feb 28, but has risen 10 percent since it reopened on March
7.
 Traders say investors are grabbing stocks they believe have
become cheap. Egyptian heavyweight Orascom Telecom, for example,
is up 20 percent since the reopening.
 ""We have been buying, we like the look of some of the banks,
construction companies, telecoms,"" Graham Stock, chief
strategist at Insparo Asset Management, told Reuters Insider TV.
 But he added: ""We are wary of companies that are too
associated with the Mubarak regime.""
 Stock's concerns are shared by many. They stem from action
taken by the new government against the many businesses that are
seen to have benefited from links to the Mubarak family.
 Investors say the Egyptian stock exchange has required them
to confirm their clients do not include a number of individuals
associated with the Mubarak regime. In Tunisia, firms say a
blacklist of companies associated with the Ben-Ali regime has
been drawn up by the new authorities.
 There was an undeniable nexus between business and the
government in both countries. In Egypt, 70-80 top businessmen
sat in Egypt's old parliament as members or allies of the
govermment. Tunisia's central bank estimated recently that 180
companies were controlled by associates of Ben Ali and his wife.
 Yet many investors worry that asset expropriations and
action against big businesses may end up causing more capital
outflows and harm the ability to attract foreign investments.
 One London-based fund manager who was previously positive on
Egypt said he had become more cautious.
 ""Things have changed a bit. There is a concern that the
country may spend a bit too much time looking backwards rather
than forwards and there could be some scapegoats,"" the investor
said. ""Most of the successful companies pretty much had a good
relationship with the powers-that-be. 
 Shares in Egyptian firms Ezz Steel and property developer
Palm Hills have tumbled 40 and 50 percent on the year
respectively, with both firms' chairmen facing charges for
alleged crimes under the former government.
 
 WARINESS SPREADS
 Few doubt the countries' long-term potential, with some even
likening Egypt to Turkey in terms of demography and companies. 
 But these are challenging times for North Africa where
economies are suffering the fallout from months of protests.
 Tourism and direct investments are down, remittances from
citizens employed in Libya and Bahrain are suffering and it is
costlier to raise cash on bond markets.
 Investors are also wary of other markets where there have
been protests, but no regime change, such as Morocco.
 Oliver Bell, who helps manage $10 billion in emerging stocks
at Pictet, recently cut his underweight on Egypt and says the
newsflow on witchhunts has in fact started to abate.
 He attributes recent buying partly to the looming dividend
season -- some firms such as Telecom Egypt and petrochem firm
Sidi Kerir have 10 percent dividend yields, he notes. 
 But Bell is steering clear of Morocco and Tunisia.
 ""Morocco has escaped the turmoil so far but there were
35,000 people on the streets recently so you can't rule it out,""
he said.
 ""The money that goes into Morocco also tends to look at
Tunisia. The newsflow on Tunisia has been positive but with
everything else going on, I want to see the whole picture.""

 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, March 29 (Reuters) - Divided global trade
negotiators risk moving further apart if a revised text on a
global deal is pushed through by Easter as planned, the United
States told World Trade Organisation (WTO) delegates on Tuesday.
 The United States' disputes with China over tariffs, access
and subsidies constitute some of the main sticking points
holding up a deal in the decade-old Doha round of trade talks.
 But the U.S., led by Ambassador Michael Punke, told
delegates at a WTO meeting that ""those consultations were not
the full extent of the U.S. concerns,"" according to a delegate
who was in the meeting but did not want to be named. The U.S.
intervention also said that ""a revised text might exacerbate
problems,"" according to the delegate.
 WTO Director General Pascal Lamy gave delegates in the same
closed-door meeting one of his starkest warnings yet that time
was running out for Doha.
""He pretty much said 'you need to decide what you are going
to do. Are you going to do this thing or not,'"" said another
delegate who left the meeting early for another appointment.
 Lamy was opening an informal session of the WTO's Trade
Negotiations Committee, which has special responsibility for the
Doha round and reports back to the WTO's General Council.
 The ambitious negotiations are aimed at opening up world
trade for the benefit of all nations, but they are stalled on a
series of sticking points over tariffs, subsidies and market
access.
 Lamy has repeatedly said progress is too slow. The latest
deadline negotiators have set themselves is a deal by the end of
this year, since elections in some key countries including the
United States could cause problems in 2012 and the talks are
already years late in reaching a conclusion.
 They hope to have a viable text ready to take to ministers
by Easter, now less than a month away.
 The first delegate said he doubted success this year, but
that saving face for the WTO was important. ""It will be about
how failure is framed,"" he said.
 A Geneva newspaper on Tuesday pronounced the talks ""dead"".
 ""The Doha round is dead, but Pascal Lamy doesn't want to
recognise it,"" Le Temps quoted a senior trade diplomat as
saying.

 (Adds analysts, Russian Deputy FinMin on debt talks)
 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, March 29 (Reuters) - Belarus on Tuesday effectively
allowed the Belarussian rouble  to devalue by 10 percent,
in a move that analysts say could help it secure bailout loans
but would not by itself fix an unsustainable foreign trade gap.
 The Belarussian rouble has come under pressure from the
country's big trade deficit and increased spending by the
government in the run-up to the December presidential election,
when President Alexander Lukashenko won a fourth term.
 To plug the gap, Belarus has asked Russia and other
ex-Soviet nations for $3 billion in loans. Moscow says it wants
to see credible adjustment proposals before it considers
emergency help.
 The Belarussian central bank said local banks were now able
to trade more freely on the over-the-counter market which should
account for up to 70 percent of total foreign exchange turnover.
 ""Banks ... have been allowed to buy and sell foreign
currency to other banks and customers at rates deviating from
the official rate by no more than 10 percent,"" it said in a
statement.
 The central bank, whose forex reserves fell 20 percent in
the first two months of this year to $4 billion due to the trade
deficit, had previously allowed banks to deal at only 2 percent
above or below the official rate.
 This tight restriction would remain in place for exchange
points dealing with retail customers, it said.
 
 POSITIVE SIGNAL
 Analysts said the move -- urged by the International
Monetary Fund -- could be taken as a positive signal by markets,
where Belarus Eurobond yields have surged since the start of
this year <0#BYEUROSAZ=>.
 ""The widening of the corridor, in essence, means a 'soft
devaluation' of the Belarussian rouble,"" said Alexander Kudrin,
head of fixed income research at Troika Dialog.
 ""This step is one of the obvious measures directed at
reviving the economy and evening out the balance of payments,
and the sooner it happens, the better for the economy.""
 However, analysts have said the rouble could devalue by
20-30 percent if a free float was allowed. Kudrin said the
exchange rate should be 50 percent lower than the current 3,038
roubles per dollar.
 
 MOSCOW ACTS TOUGH
 The limited devaluation, though, could help Belarus obtain
additional funding to plug the current account gap, said Ivan
Tchakarov, chief economist for Russia and CIS at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.
 ""This kind of devaluation could be consistent with
fundamentals but it will not close that gap... They need to get
more money -- either from the International Monetary Fund or
Russia,"" he said.
 Belarus has not applied for IMF financing, opting to seek
aid from Russia instead. But, just like the Fund, Russia would
require a credible adjustment package before agreeing to Minsk's
request, an international financial source said.
 ""There are (loan) talks, but it is a lengthy process,""
Russian Deputy Finance Minister Dmitry Pankin told Reuters.
""This week they must present to us their proposals on how to
stabilise the situation.""
 Short of money and friends, Lukashenko may have to offer key
assets for sale to Russia, further undermining the viability of
Belarus's Soviet-style command economy, already squeezed after
Moscow cut subsidies on oil and gas supplies.
 
 ELECTION PROMISES
 The central bank, which effectively halted forex trading
this month, said last Thursday it would restart sales of foreign
currency to banks from April 1 but would sell only as much as it
could buy from exporters.
 Until mid-March, it was selling foreign currency to support
the rouble, trying to keep the exchange rate loosely pegged to a
basket made up of the dollar, the euro and the Russian rouble.
 Raising the average monthly wage to an equivalent of $500
was one of the key items on Lukashenko's election agenda and
this makes devaluation politically painful.
 ""The currency crisis is destroying people's trust in the
government,"" said Leonid Zaiko, the head of Minsk-based
Strategiya think tank.
 ""(It means) the central bank and the government would have
to renege on the promises Lukashenko... made before the
elections.""

* Bullard says waiting too long will bring inflation

 By Jan Lopatka and Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE, March 29 (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve chief
James Bullard urged the U.S. central bank on Tuesday to begin
reversing its campaign of monetary easing, saying it could trim
its $600 billion bond-buying programme by $100 billion.
 Bullard, who does not have a vote on Fed policy this year,
added that U.S. policymakers may not be willing or able to wait
for all global uncertainties to be resolved before they begin
normalising their very loose monetary policy.
 ""One of the things that I'm concerned about is that policy
is so easy right now that we have to get started on the process
of getting back to normal because it will take a long time,""
Bullard told reporters on the sidelines of an economic
conference in Prague on Tuesday.
 When asked if he thought that process should begin now, he
said: ""Yes, we're still buying treasuries. We're feeding the
fire at this moment.""
 Bullard, seen as a centrist on the policy-setting committee,
said the Fed could start tapering off its asset purchases and
then pause for several policy meetings before taking further
tightening steps.
 His comments contrasted with comments from other senior Fed
officials who have said this week only that they did not see a
need for another round of asset buying.
 Bullard's comments drove the euro to a session low against
the dollar. The single European currency  was trading bid
at 1.4060 at 1315 GMT.
 He added that there was a difference of opinion on the speed
of reversing monetary easing and cutting back the asset
purchasing programme.
 ""I think it could be on the order of $100 billion less than
what we had initially thought, but I would leave that up to how
the rest of the committee would want,"" Bullard told reporters.
 Still, analysts say it is highly unlikely the Fed will stop
short of purchasing the full $600 billion in U.S. government
bonds, and top Fed officials said on Monday the economy still
needed support. [ID:nN28221312]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Bullard said in late February that he would support scaling
back the central bank's $600 billion bond buying programme in
light of a strengthening economy. 
 Even before the Fed launched the current round of monetary
easing in November, Bullard was arguing that the central bank
should move policy in increments of $100 billion worth of
securities purchases from meeting to meeting.
 ""We're purchasing securities at a rapid rate. If we stop
that process and we just let the balance sheet stay at a high
level and keep the policy rate near zero, and keep our extended
period language, we could pause for a couple of meetings like
that,"" he said on Tuesday. 
 ""Then we could start to take other measures to start to
reduce the size of the balance sheet, to think about possible
language changes with the extended period, to eventually get the
policy rate off zero.""
 
 RISKS
 Risks clouding the outlook include the turmoil in the Middle
East and North Africa, the aftermath of the Japanese tsunami,
the European sovereign debt crisis and the U.S. fiscal situation
and possibility of a government shutdown, Bullard said.
 ""Because we are so accommodative right now, the FOMC may not
be willing or able to wait until every single global uncertainty
is resolved before we can begin normalising policy,"" he said.
 ""If we wait too long we will get a lot of inflation in the
United States and around the world.""
 Still, he said that the most likely prospect was that the
main risks for the outlook would be resolved ""without becoming
global macroeconomic shocks"".
 The Fed has kept short-term interest rates near zero since
December 2008 and has bought more than $2 trillion in long-term
securities to push borrowing costs down further and boost
recovery from the 2007-2009 recession.
 Bullard said that the process of normalising policy would
still leave unprecedented policy accommodation on the table, and
that growth prospects remained reasonably good and had improved
since last summer. 
 ""As 2011 started we were about 18 months past the end of the
recession, and that's about the kind of timing when I would
expect the economy to pick up and start growing fairly rapidly,""
he said.
 But he said any failure to address the U.S. fiscal situation
would pose a risk to U.S. and global recovery.
 President Barack Obama's Democrats on Monday offered to cut
another $20 billion from the U.S. budget in an attempt to reach
a deal with congressional Republicans that would avert a
government shutdown. [ID:nLDE72S05T]

* ""Novel food"" rules to be redrawn after 3 years of talks
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, March 29 (Reuters) - Talks within the European
Union broke down on Tuesday over how to deal with food from
cloned animals, sending EU proposals on the sale of new types of
foods back to the drawing board after three years of debate.
 Following all-night negotiations in Brussels, EU lawmakers
were ready to drop their demand for a ban on the sale of food
from the conventionally bred offspring of cloned animals, in
return for mandatory labelling for all such products.
 But EU governments rejected the compromise and said it
risked dragging the 27-nation bloc into a ""full blown trade war""
with countries that already export food products derived from
the young of cloned animals, such as the United States.
 ""The European Parliament ... tried to push the (European)
Council to accept a misleading, unfeasible 'solution' that in
practice would have required drawing a family tree for each
slice of cheese or salami,"" said Hungary's farm minister Sandor
Fazakas.
 Hungary, which chaired the showdown talks as holder of the
EU's rotating presidency, said it had been ready to accept a ban
on the use of cloning for food production in Europe and ""the
gradual introduction of labelling"" for products from the
offspring of clones.
 But failure to reach an agreement means the proposals on
regulating so-called ""novel foods"", which are defined as
foodstuffs not consumed significantly in the EU before 1997,
must be redrafted, and could take ""several more years"" to
finalise, Hungary said.
 CONSUMER CONCERNS
 The European Parliament's negotiators in the talks accused
EU governments of ignoring public opinion, citing a 2008
consumer survey that showed that 58 percent of Europeans
believed cloning should never be used for food production.
 ""We made a huge effort to compromise, but we were not
willing to betray consumers on their right to know whether food
comes from animals bred using clones,"" lawmakers Gianni Pittella
and Kartika Liotard said in a joint statement.
 The use of cloning for food production is not currently
widespread in Europe.
 The United States is the most advanced country in terms of
cloning for food production, with estimates provided by
companies suggesting that ""thousands of cattle"" and ""hundreds of
pigs"" have been cloned there so far.
 The United States currently has a voluntary moratorium on
the marketing of food from cloned animals but not from their
offspring.
 Animal cloning, which uses DNA transfer to create an exact
genetic copy of an animal, currently has a success rate below 20
percent, with most cloned animals dying during or shortly after
birth.
 The technique is complex and costly, ensuring that cloned
animals are unlikely to be used themselves as food, but they can
be bred traditionally to produce offspring that share similar
traits, such as high milk production or rapid growth.
 The EU's executive -- the European Commission -- is now
expected to propose separate regulation to control the use of
cloning in Europe, as well as new proposals on novel foods,
which includes the use of nanotechnology in food production.

 By David Milliken and Keith Weir
 LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank
slightly less than previously estimated at the end of 2010, but
still suffered its biggest drop since 2009, according to data
that underlines the uncertain nature of its recovery.
 Tuesday's figures did not shift economists' view that
first-quarter GDP data due next month will be the key to whether
the Bank of England raises interest rates in the first half of
this year, and illustrate the economy's vulnerability as the
government embarks on a tough austerity programme.
 The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic
product (GDP) contracted by 0.5 percent in the last three months
of 2010 -- the same as its initial estimate in January but a
slightly smaller fall than a revised estimate made last month.
 ""It's still a pretty lacklustre backdrop and that probably
sets the tone for the first half of this year,"" said Ross
Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 Year-on-year, fourth-quarter GDP growth was unrevised at 1.5
percent, in line with economists' forecasts.
 Share prices pared losses after the data, but there was
little reaction from sterling or the government bond market.
 ""The figures generally have relatively few implications for
monetary policy,"" said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec.
""Our view is that what's going to be very important is the
retail figures over the next few months, and our readings of
those trends is that they trend to argue against a May rate
hike.""
 The ONS said that Britain's coldest December in 100 years
had knocked 0.5 percentage points off national output, causing
the biggest fall in GDP since the second quarter of 2009, and
that growth would have been flat without the adverse weather.
 The services sector and the construction sector both
suffered their biggest contractions since the second quarter of
2009, when Britain's economy was deep in recession. Household
expenditure also suffered its biggest fall since then.
 Industrial output grew at its fastest pace since the second
quarter of 2010, but this did not stop Britain recording its
biggest goods trade deficit since records began in 1955.
 The overall current account deficit totalled 2.9 percent of
GDP in the fourth quarter, also the biggest since the second
quarter of 2009.

 * Rising oil prices also putting brakes on air traffic
 * Aftereffects of Japanese quake to hit march numbers

(Adds details, background, CEO quote)
 GENEVA, March 29 (Reuters) - Growing unrest in the Middle
East and North Africa stifled air passenger traffic in February,
reducing growth sharply from January levels, International Air
Transport Association figures released on Tuesday showed.
 International passenger traffic grew 6 percent compared with
a year earlier, down from a revised 8.4 percent rise in January
as would-be travellers delayed or postponed their journeys to
the region, depressing monthly numbers.
 ""The political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
during February is estimated to have cut international traffic
by about 1 percent. As such it is responsible almost entirely
for the slippage in passenger demand growth,"" IATA said.
 Air freight -- an important measure of world trade -- was
also impacted by the unrest, as well as by factory shutdowns due
to the Chinese New Year, which occurred in the first part of
February. 
 Air cargo traffic was up just 2.3 percent in February after
rising 8.7 percent in January, IATA said in its monthly traffic
figures.
 Rising oil prices, pushed up by concerns the unrest could
force oil prices up further, are also choking air traffic.
 The Japanese earthquake and ensuing concerns over a damaged
nuclear power plant combined with continuing unrest in the MENA
region are expected to squeeze March air traffic further.
 ""As the unrest in Egypt and Tunisia spreads across the
Middle East and North Africa, demand growth across the region is
taking a step back,"" said IATA Chief Executive Giovanni
Bisignani in a statement.
 ""The tragic earthquake and its aftermath in Japan will most
certainly see a further dampening of demand from March."" 
 IATA represents 240 airlines operating 94 percent of all
international traffic. Domestic flights are excluded from its
data.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - European banking shares
helped lead world stocks lower on Tuesday after an Italian bank
announced a capital increase, while the dollar rose after a top
Federal Reserve official said the U.S. central bank's asset
purchase plan should be curtailed.
 U.S. stocks rose on strength in large-cap technology
stocks, but investors remained cautious due to the continuing
global crises and the approach of the end of the first
quarter.
 Uncertainty over Libya drove up the price of oil, as
government troops under Muammar Gaddafi halted a rebel advance
aimed at restoring oil exports from the OPEC member.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.1 percent, after slipping about 0.3 percent earlier, mainly
as a result of weakness in Europe. Emerging market stocks
<.MSCIEF> gained around 0.4 percent.
 The surprise announcement by Italy's UBI Banca's 
of a 1 billion euro ($1.4 billion) capital hike dragged down
Italian banks on speculation that other lenders could be
heading down the same road. UBI shares fell more than 11
percent. Investors also remained cautious ahead of the results
of stress tests on Irish banks, due on Thursday.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 0.3 percent.
 ""We are still very cautious on the banking sector as a
whole,"" said Felicity Smith, fund manager at Bedlam Asset
Management. ""The big problem is that they need to hold more
capital and that means in future, even if the economy grows,
the returns they generate would be lower.""
 Volume has begun to fall on European bourses in line with
2011 lows on Wall Street.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 36.37
points, or 0.30 percent, at 12,234.25. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 1.48 points, or 0.11 percent, at
1,311.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 11.35
points, or 0.42 percent, at 2,742.03.
 ""The quarter is ending with a lot of uncertainties out
there, resulting in messy intraday moves at the same time that
nothing is really happening,"" said Michael Shaoul, chairman of
the New York-based Marketfield Asset Management, which oversees
$973 million.
 ""There's nothing obvious about what investors need to do in
this environment, and that's why you're seeing such low
volume,"" he said. ""No one has any reason to recommit capital.""
 The Nasdaq was helped by strength in large-cap tech shares.
Amazon.com Inc  rose 2.2 percent to $173.12 after it
introduced a service offering remote access to music.
Cisco Systems  rose 1.6 percent to $17.40 after it said
it plans to buy newScale Inc for an undisclosed amount to boost
its cloud computing services.[nL3E7ET0TS] [nN29243506]
 EURO/DOLLAR
 The dollar rose against the euro after the president of the
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, James Bullard, told an audience
in Prague that the U.S. economy was strong enough to curtail
the Fed's $600 billion asset purchase program by some $100
billion. [ID:nLDE72S0RJ].
 The euro hit a session low of $1.4060 on the EBS trading
platform after falling through reported bids at $1.4080. It
last traded at $1.4085 . Traders said reported sovereign
bids at $1.4050 could limit losses in the single currency,
however.
 Portugal's debt remained under pressure, with yields on its
10-year bonds near record levels above 8 percent, complicating
the country's attempts to avoid a European Union bailout.
 The dollar extended gains against the euro after data
showed U.S. single family home prices fell for a seventh
straight month in January, offering fresh evidence that the
housing market recession in the United States was not over yet.
[ID:nDZE7DS003].
 Meanwhile, the dollar and euro both reached their highest
levels against the yen since since March 18, when the Bank of
Japan and other major central banks intervened to stop runaway
yen gains.
 The dollar rose to high of 82.42 yen  on trading
platform EBS. The euro rose to 115.86  .It was on
course to test 116.03, above which would mark a 10-month high.
 In commodity markets, U.S. crude's benchmark May contract
 for May delivery was flat at just above $104 a barrel,
after earlier falling more than a dollar earlier. [O/R]
 Analysts said Japan's lack of progress in containing the
nuclear crisis was likely to delay the world's third-largest
oil user's return to full industrial strength, but the downside
for oil prices could be limited by unrest in the Middle East.
 ""We have two factors that are countervailing,"" said Harry
Tchilinguirian, analyst at BNP Paribas.
 ""There is a risk premium in the Middle East built in on
risk of further contagion. On the other hand we have the fact
Japan is a major component of the global supply chain, so the
potential for a price correction in the second quarter
remains.""
 U.S. gold remained under pressure after Monday's losses as
the prospect of interest rate increases undermined its appeal
as an inflation hedge. Copper also slipped as demand from top
consumer China waned. [GOL/] [MET/L]

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2011 04:40AM ET</span>",UK economy shrank less than thought in Q4 2010," LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Britain's economy contracted by
slightly less in the final three months of 2010 than
statisticians had earlier estimated, due to broad-based upward
revisions to a range of sectors.
 The Office for National Statistics revised fourth-quarter
GDP growth upwards to -0.5 percent on the quarter from its most
recent previous estimate of -0.6 percent, though the new figure
is still the biggest decline since the second quarter of 2009.
 The annual rate of growth was unrevised at 1.5 percent.
Economists had expected both rates to remain unrevised at -0.6
percent and 1.5 percent respectively.
 The ONS said that Britain's coldest December in 100 years
had knocked 0.5 percentage points off GDP, and that growth would
have been flat without the adverse weather.
 The services sector and the construction sector both
suffered their biggest contractions since the second quarter of
2009, when Britain's economy was deep in recession. House hold
expenditure also suffered its biggest fall since then.
 However, industrial output grew at its fastest pace since
the second quarter of 2010.

 * France had seen China as partner in global monetary reform
 * China is proving to be more cautious than expected
 * Its main aim is bigger role for yuan, not global change

 By Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - A lack of cohesion on global
monetary reform will be on display this week when the Group of
20 wealthy and developing economies meets in China for a
seminar, an event that was supposed to have been a starting
point for Sino-French efforts to design a new global currency
order.	
 At the start of its year-long G20 presidency, the French
government thought it could count on China as a partner in
spearheading change. Four months on, those hopes have been
dashed by the reality of conflicting national interests and the
enormity of the challenge in any serious attempt at reform.	
 Discussion topics at the seminar, which takes place on
Thursday, still sound ambitious.	
 A first panel is set to look at shortcomings in the
international monetary system. In a sign of the importance that
France attaches to the event, President Nicolas Sarkozy will
deliver the opening speech, though he will be the only head of
state attending the meeting.	
 But all the signals from China are that it is a most
reluctant host, its commitment to the cause of reform less
extensive than France had believed.	
 Stuttering cooperation stems in part from a rancorous G20
meeting in France in February, when China fought hard against a
plan to include exchange rates and currency reserves as
indicators for identifying economic imbalances.	
 ""China doesn't think that there's really much room for
progress in the G20 under France. The government (Beijing) has
become more realistic in pushing instead for yuan
internationalisation ... something it can achieve itself,"" said
Zhang Ming, an economist in the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, a top government think-tank in Beijing.	
 ""It's not as enthusiastic as before about getting into the
currency reform issue,"" Zhang added	
 Despite being a showpiece of Sarkozy's G20 agenda, basic
details about the seminar have only been finalised at the last
minute. China agreed just a month ago to hold it in Nanjing, a
second-tier city that was the national capital in the past but
has little economic or political clout today.	
 The Chinese foreign ministry has also taken pains to
distance itself from the seminar, emphasising that France is the
organiser and China merely the staging ground. It has insisted
that a small think-tank headed by a retired vice premier is
responsible for the Chinese side of the planning.	
 
 TOUGH ROAD	
 Even if France and China were getting along swimmingly,
reform of the global monetary system was never going to be a
simple task.	
 France seized on a proposal made two years ago by People's
Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan to build up the special
drawing right (SDR), the International Monetary Fund's unit of
account, into a global reserve currency that would eventually
displace the dollar.	
 In an essay that garnered much attention at the time, Zhou
said the objective was to have a super-sovereign currency, one
that is ""disconnected from the economic conditions and sovereign
interests of any single country"".	
 Laying out his G20 priorities, Sarkozy said in December that
he wanted to look at widening the SDR's role and reducing
reliance on the dollar. Given that China had mooted this idea,
its backing would have seemed a foregone conclusion.	
 But as France is learning, China's enthusiasm for the SDR
has cooled along the way. A series of Chinese officials have
said Zhou's essay was mainly an academic exercise. Zhou himself
later said that he had put the proposal forward as a way of
deflecting criticism of China's own currency, which many other
governments say is artificially cheap.	
 ""China understands that reforming global financial and
monetary institutions will be a gradual process. It won't be
looking for radical or dramatic outcomes from the G20 summit,""
said Guo Xian'gang, vice president of the China Institute of
International Studies in Beijing.	
 ""China will prefer a more cautious path than Sarkozy might
want to support,"" he said.	
 
 YUAN OR SDR?	
 Beijing's fundamental concern about the dollar may in fact
be much narrower than the supposed dysfunctions it causes in the
global economy. With about two-thirds of its $2.85 trillion
invested in U.S. assets, China worries that any fall in the
dollar will erode its own wealth.	
 The solution need not be so complicated as fashioning a new
global reserve currency, Owen Humpage, a senior economic adviser
in the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland, wrote in a rejoinder to Zhou's initial essay.	
 ""Countries, like China, that worry about their expanding
dollar portfolios have another option: allow their currencies to
appreciate,"" he said.	
 China has followed that advice to a limited extent since the
middle of last year, letting the yuan rise about 4 percent
against the dollar.	
 Beijing has also intensified efforts to shape the yuan into
an international currency, especially for settling trade deals,
a transition that will limit its exposure to the dollar over
time.	
 China has not entirely forgotten the SDR. But rather than
beefing up the IMF currency in its own right,
internationalisation of the yuan has become the prism through
which Beijing views the SDR.	
 Xia Bin, an academic adviser to the Chinese central bank,
wrote in a book this year that Beijing should aspire to have the
yuan join the dollar, pound, yen and euro as a component of the
SDR basket.	
 ""This would be a reflection of the yuan's international
status and it would also be a basic foundation for the process
of further internationalising the yuan,"" he said.	
 Practically, including the yuan in the SDR would make little
difference, because the Chinese currency would still not be
fully convertible. However, in a symbolic sense, it would
capture China's vision of the future global monetary order, one
in which the yuan plays an increasingly central role.

 By Richard Leong	
 HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks rebounded on
Tuesday from early losses tied to Japan's struggle to contain
the world's worst nuclear crisis in decades, while the euro
steadied after comments by the European Central Bank's chief
bolstered the view it would raise interest rates soon.	
 Japan's Nikkei index was down about 0.3 percent in
late trading after falling as much as 1.5 percent earlier.	
 Early price-drops enticed bargain-minded investors who feel
stocks are undervalued and poised to rise after Thursday's end
of first quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year,
analysts said.	
 ""Some investors concluded now it's an opportunity to pick up
some shares,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at
AMP Capital Investors in Sydney. ""The broad trend is up and dips
are being bought.""	
 Stocks fell initially following Monday's losses on Wall
Street and news that plutonium was found in soil at the
earthquake-stricken Fukushima nuclear plant. [ID:nL3E7ES2ND]	
 Heightening the uncertainty for investors, some Japanese
companies said there would be delays in reporting full-year
financial results as they assessed the damage from the
devastating quake and tsunami which hit the country's northeast
on March 11, and the impact of widespread power outages which
are still preventing many firms from restarting production
lines. [ID:nTKZ006904]	
 Shortages of key components made in Japan have forced some
manufacturers, particularly auto makers, to cut back production
in North America, Europe and parts of Asia.	
 MSCI's index of Asian shares outside Japan
rose 0.37 percent after slipping 0.06 percent earlier.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 indexed gained 0.47 percent to 4755.80.	
 In Japan, shares of Fukushima's operator Tokyo Electric
Power (TEPCO) were untraded on a flood of sell orders
on a newspaper report. The Yomiuri paper citing unidentified
government sources as saying there was talk about temporarily
nationalising the utility, which a top Japanese official denied.
[ID:nLJE7EI00H]	
 ""TEPCO is the ground zero of the problem,"" said Adrian
Foster, head of financial markets research Asia-Pacific at
Rabobank International in Hong Kong. ""This is disproportionately
a Japan issue.""	
 A tepid session on Wall Street overnight reinforced
investors' aversion to piling back into riskier assets. Data
showed U.S. consumers increased spending in February but much of
the gain went to cover rising food and energy costs, giving the
economy only a modest lift.

 
 
 EURO FINDS FOOTING	
 In currency markets, the euro stabilised after ECB chief
Jean-Claude Trichet said inflation in the euro zone was
""durably"" above the central bank's target, reinforcing the view
it will raise interest rates early next month. The move would
boost the value of the single currency and returns on
euro-denominated investments.	
 Still, the euro remained under pressure because of 
 the region's festering sovereign debt problems and
uncertainties stemming from Sunday's loss of a key state
election by Germany's ruling party. 
 The euro last traded at $1.4108 , compared with
$1.4078 late in New York on Monday. Early in the session, it was
as high as $1.4111.	
 The yen firmed against the dollar as the discovery of
plutonium leak at the Fukushima plant, together with the
fighting in Libya and unrest in the Middle East, stoked some
safe haven demand for the Japanese currency.	
 The dollar fell about 0.2 percent to 81.64 yen ,
moving further away from 82.00 -- the March 18 high hit after
the world's major central banks intervened to stem the yen's
strength. 
 A steady euro fostered support for gold after losing ground
on Monday. Spot gold was last $1,419.69 an ounce in
tight-range trading, compared with $1,419.50 late in New York on
Monday. It is 2 percent below the record high of $1,447.40 set
on March 24. 
 Brent oil prices fell for a third straight day after rising
on a weak dollar and the political turmoil in North Africa and
Libya.	
 Several OPEC producers have boosted output recently to make
up for supply disruptions in Libya as rebels fight government
forces.	
 Brent crude  fell 38 cents to $114.42 a barrel, while
U.S. crude  slipped 26 cents to $103.72.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2011 02:08AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 10-Japan finds plutonium in soil at stricken nuclear plant ," * Japan's nuclear safety agency worried about reactor breach
 * Radiation increases, bad news piles up from site
 * PM Kan lambasted in parliament over disaster
 * French president to visit this week
(Adds details)	
 By Chizu Nomiyama and Kazunori Takada	
 TOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - Plutonium found in soil at the
Fukushima nuclear complex heightened alarm on Tuesday over
Japan's battle to contain the world's worst atomic crisis in 25
years, as pressure mounted on the prime minister to widen an
evacuation zone around the plant.	
 Some opposition lawmakers blasted Naoto Kan in parliament
for his handling of the disaster and for not widening the
exclusion zone. Kan said he was seeking advice on such a step,
which would force 130,000 people to move in addition to 70,000
already displaced.	
 The drama at the six-reactor facility has compounded Japan's
agony after an earthquake and tsunami on March 11 left more than
28,000 people dead or missing in the devastated northeast.	
 In a gesture of support, France said it had sent two nuclear
experts to Japan to help contain the accident and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy will visit on Thursday for a meeting
with Kan. 
 France is the world's most nuclear-dependent country,
producing 75 percent of its power needs from 58 nuclear
reactors, and selling state-owned Areva's reactors around the
world. Sarkozy will be the first foreign leader to visit since
the earthquake.	
 In the latest blow to hopes authorities were gradually
getting the plant under control, operator Tokyo Electric Power
Co said plutonium was found at low-risk levels in soil
samples at the facility.	
 A by-product of atomic reactions and also used in nuclear
bombs, plutonium is highly carcinogenic and one of the most
dangerous substances on the planet, experts say.	
 They believe some of the plutonium may have come from spent
fuel rods at Fukushima or damage to reactor No. 3, the only one
to use plutonium in its fuel mix.	
 Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said while the
plutonium levels were not harmful to human health, the discovery
could mean the reactor's containment mechanism had been
breached.	
 ""Plutonium is a substance that's emitted when the
temperature is high, and it's also heavy and so does not leak
out easily,"" agency deputy director Hidehiko Nishiyama told a
news conference.	
 ""So if plutonium has emerged from the reactor, that tells us
something about the damage to the fuel. And if it has breached
the original containment system, it underlines the gravity and
seriousness of this accident.""	
 
 Sakae Muto, a Tokyo Electric vice-president, said the traces
of plutonium-238, 239 and 240 were in keeping with levels found
in Japan in the past due to particles in the atmosphere from
nuclear testing abroad.	
 ""I apologise for making people worried,"" Muto said.	
 With towns on the northeast coast reduced to apocalyptic
landscapes of mud and debris following the quake and tsunami,
more than a quarter of a million people are homeless. The event
may be the world's costliest natural disaster, with estimates of
damage topping $300 billion.	
 
 PARTIAL MELTDOWN	
 Workers at Fukushima may have to struggle for weeks or
months under extremely dangerous conditions to re-start cooling
systems vital to control the reactors and avert total meltdown.	
 On Monday, highly contaminated water was found in concrete
tunnels extending beyond one reactor, while at the weekend
radiation hit 100,000 times over normal in water inside another.	
 That poses a major dilemma for Tokyo Electric, which wants
to douse the reactors to cool them, but not worsen the spread of
radiation.	
 Japan's nuclear safety agency said fuel rods in
the plant's reactors 1, 2 and 3 were damaged and there was a
high possibility of some leakage from their containment vessels.	
 The crisis, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in
1986, has contaminated vegetables and milk from the area, as
well as the surrounding sea. U.S. experts said groundwater,
reservoirs and the sea all faced ""significant contamination"".	
 A Tokyo Electric official told a briefing he could not rule
out the possibility that radioactive water could still be
entering the sea, though there was no continuous flow.	
 Tokyo Electric has sought help from French
companies including Electricite de France SA and Areva
SA .	
 French Ecology Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet
said on Tuesday that experts from Areva and nuclear research
body CEA had been sent to Japan ""to share our experience on
pumping and the treatment of radioactive water"".	
 As well as seeking help from France, Japan is also
consulting the United States.	
 The government has declined to outline any specific plan for
its nuclear energy policy but said renewable energy would play
an important role in future.	
 
 EVACUATION ZONE DILEMMA	
 Experts have said the lack of information and some
inconsistent data made it hard to understand what was happening
at Fukushima, which appears to have moved from a core-meltdown
phase to one in which management of released radioactivity is
paramount.	
 Another pressing concern has been the well-being of people
living near the plant. More than 70,000 people have been
evacuated from within 20 km (12 miles) of the facility. 
 But opposition MP Yosuke Isozaki blasted Kan for not
ordering people living between 20 km and 30 km (12-19 miles)
from the plant to also leave.	
 ""Is there anything as irresponsible as this?"" Isozaki asked.	
 The 130,000 people living inside the wider zone have been
encouraged -- but not ordered -- to leave.	
 Environmental group Greenpeace has urged an extension of the
20-km evacuation zone while the United States has recommended
its citizens who live within 80 km (50 miles) of the plant to
leave or shelter indoors.	
 Kan, leading Japan during its worst crisis since World War
Two, was already deeply unpopular and under pressure to resign
when the crisis began.	
 He repeatedly defended his decision to fly over the stricken
nuclear site a day after the quake, saying it had been important
to see it for himself. His top spokesman on Monday denied the
visit had delayed operations to cool the reactors, as some media
had reported.	
 The crisis has also put enormous pressure on Tokyo Electric,
criticised for safety lapses and a slow disaster response. Its
boss, Masataka Shimizu, has barely been seen.	
 The government might nationalise Tokyo Electric to deal with
the crisis, National Strategy Minister Koichiro Gemba said. Its
shares have fallen almost 75 percent since the quake including a
19 percent tumble on Tuesday to a 47-year low.	
 Beyond the evacuation zone, traces of radiation have been
found in tap water in Tokyo and as far away as Iceland.	
 Japanese officials and international experts have generally
said the levels away from the plant were not dangerous for human
beings, who in any case face higher radiation doses on a daily
basis from natural sources, X-rays or flying.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Tuesday after comments by the head of the European Central
Bank the previous day reinforced expectations for higher
interest rates, while the yen held steady with the focus on
Japan's nuclear crisis.	
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Monday inflation
in the euro zone is ""durably"" above the ECB's target, cementing
expectations that the central bank would raise interest rates
next month. 
 His comments also helped relieve pressure on the single
currency from the euro zone debt crisis, with concerns rising
about Portugal's ability to finance itself.	
 ""Investors are focused on inflation expectations in the euro
zone. An April hike may be a done deal, although there's still
some uncertainty about what's going to happen beyond that,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Barclays
Capital.	
 ""A recent rise in oil prices is also raising expectations
that oil producers will diversify away from the dollar, which
would also benefit the euro.""	
 The euro rose 0.1 percent on the day to $1.4101 ,
moving away from the previous day's 1-1/2 week low around
$1.4020. 
 Reflecting rising rate hike expectations, key euro-priced
interbank lending rates rose to a 22-month high on Monday with
the level of excess liquidity in money markets
falling.[ID:nLDE72R0W1]	
 The European single currency is one of the best performing
currencies against the dollar this year, having risen 5.4
percent since January. The euro's resistance levels are seen at
$1.4220 and $1.4248.	
 The dollar was slightly weaker at 81.67 yen , having
fallen to 81.51 earlier as the discovery of plutonium in soil at
the quake-hit Japanese nuclear plant soured risk sentiment.	
 The low-yielding yen tends to rise in times of risk aversion
because Japan's current account surplus puts upward pressure on
the yen in the absence of portfolio outflows into risky overseas
assets.	
 A customer dealer for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo
reported a significant amount of dollar offers, mainly from
Japanese exporters, at and above 82 yen -- the March 18 high hit
after coordinated G7 intervention to curb the yen at Japan's
request. 
 He said the dollar is vulnerable to a fall towards 80.80.	
 Analysts say players would be reluctant to push the dollar
below 80 yen on worries about further intervention.	
 Others also reported talk that Japanese exporters may have
over-hedged for the April-June period following production and
sales cuts, a factor which could also weigh on the yen.	
 
 QE2 ENDGAME	
 Following hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve last week,
interest rate differentials widened in favour of the dollar
against the yen.	
 But that rate support for the dollar waned after another Fed
official said on Monday that the U.S. economy still needed
support from the central bank's full $600 billion planned bond
purchases [ID:nN28221312].	
 ""The likely dip in confidence in the wake of the Japan
earthquake and evidence of deepening housing deflation can both
serve as reminders that the majority of FOMC members are
unlikely to consider current economic performance good enough to
meet the hurdle rate for a premature end to QE2,"" BNP Paribas
said in a note to clients.	
 The dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was slightly
higher on the day at 76.150.	
 The two-year U.S. Treasury yield had risen to a three-week
high at 0.785 percent at one stage, up more than 14
basis points in five days, widening its gap over comparable
Japanese yields.	
 Preliminary estimates from Citi's month-end hedge
rebalancing model suggested foreign buying of Japanese yen may
dominate the March month-end fix. 
 Citi said Japan's March 11 earthquake and subsequent nuclear
crisis had hit local equities hard, leaving foreign investors
over-hedged. This means that passive index-following investors
may need to buy the yen at the month-end to reduce the value of
their hedges. 
 In other currencies, the signals pointed to net dollar
buying against the euro and sterling.

levels
 * MOL's ship expected to arrive at port of Kobe on Wednesday
(Adds industry reaction)	
 By Chikako Mogi and Randy Fabi	
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, March 29 (Reuters) - Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
has not yet decided what it will do with its container
ship when it returns to Japan this week, a company official said
on Tuesday, after China rejected the vessel for ""abnormal""
radiation levels.	
 The MOL Presence is the first ship barred from unloading its
cargo at a foreign port over radiation concerns since Japan's
Fukushima nuclear plant was crippled by the March 11 earthquake,
a spokesman for the Japanese Shipowners Association said.	
 Governments, including China and the United States, have
begun screening for radiation on ships that travelled from
Japan's quake-hit northeast, threatening to slow seaborne trade
for the world's third largest economy.	
 ""The container ship is expected to arrive in the port of
Kobe on Wednesday,"" said a spokeswoman for MOL, the world's 11th
largest container shipper. ""The travel plan on when or whether
the container ship will depart Kobe is not decided as of now.""



 If radiation levels are confirmed to be too high on the
vessel, MOL may be forced to dispose of the machinery, furniture
and other cargo on the ship and reimburse its clients since
insurance companies do not cover radiation exposure linked to
nuclear accidents, industry experts said.	
 The vessel would also need to be thoroughly cleaned before
it can set sail again.	
 Chinese authorities detected a maximum of 3.5 microsieverts
per hour on MOL's ship when it arrived at the port of Xiamen in
eastern Fujian province last week, the company
spokeswoman said.	
 That is above the global average of naturally occurring
background radiation, but half of the cosmic radiation
experienced on a Tokyo-New York flight. [ID:nL3E7ER02S]	
 The Chinese standard level was not disclosed.	
 
 U.S. SHIPMENT	
 The MOL Presence originated in California, stopping in Tokyo
for only a few hours on March 17 before arriving in China four
days later, port authorities said.	
 Ports in Tokyo Bay, located 240 km (150 miles) south of the
Fukushima nuclear plant, remain outside the exclusion zone for
most shipping companies.	
 However, at least three container firms -- Germany's
Hapag-Lloyd , Claus-Peter Offen and Hong Kong's Orient
Overseas Container Line -- have widened their ""no-go""
area to more than double the industry norm to include Tokyo Bay.	
 ""At this point, there is no change to our shipping schedule,
including location of the ports we call at,"" the MOL's
spokeswoman said. She said this is the first case a Mitsui ship
was turned back.	
 Radiation levels as of late Monday in Tokyo Bay ports were
considered ""very safe"", Japan's transport ministry said on its
website.	
 ""Thus far, the flow of traffic to and from Japan
has not been impacted by radiation fears,"" said a U.S.-based
shipping source.	
 ""Although some owners have been reluctant to trade cargoes
to Japan, there have been sufficient owners willing to do so and
that has minimized the impact.""

 * Gold flat on euro, oil slides again despite Libyan turmoil

 By Richard Leong	
 HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters) - Japanese shares fell on
Tuesday as workers struggled to contain the world's worst
nuclear crisis in decades, while the euro steadied after
comments from the European Central Bank's chief bolstered the
view that it would raise interest rates soon.	
 Plutonium found in soil at the earthquake-stricken Fukushima
nuclear plant added to anxiety over Japan's protracted fight to
prevent further radiation leaks. [ID:nL3E7ES2ND]	
 Heightening the uncertainty for investors, some Japanese
companies said there would be delays in reporting full-year
financial results as they assessed the damage from the
devastating quake and tsunami which hit the country's northeast
on March 11, and the impact of widespread power outages which
are still preventing many firms from restarting production
lines. [ID:nTKZ006904]	
 Shortages of key components made in Japan have forced some
manufacturers, particularly auto makers, to cut back production
in North America, Europe and parts of Asia.	
 Japan's Nikkei fell 1.5 percent, while MSCI's index
of Asian shares outside Japan dipped 0.06
percent.	
 Shares of Fukushima's operator Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO)
were untraded on a flood of sell orders on a newspaper
report. The Yomiuri paper citing unidentified government sources
said there is talk to temporarily nationalise the utility, which
a top Japanese official denied. [ID:nLJE7EI00H]	
 ""TEPCO is the ground zero of the problem,"" said Adrian
Foster, head of financial markets research Asia-Pacific at
Rabobank International in Hong Kong. ""This is disproportionately
a Japan issue	
 A tepid session on Wall Street overnight reinforced
investors' aversion to piling back into riskier assets. Data
showed U.S. consumers increased spending in February but much of
the gain went to cover rising food and energy costs, giving the
economy only a modest lift.

 
 
 EURO FINDS FOOTING	
 In currency markets, the euro stabilised after ECB chief
Jean-Claude Trichet said inflation in the euro zone was
""durably"" above the central bank's target, reinforcing the view
it will raise interest rates early next month. The move would
boost the value of the single currency and returns on
euro-denominated investments.	
 Still, the euro remained under pressure on the region's
festering sovereign debt problems and uncertainties stemming
from Sunday's loss of a key state election by Germany's ruling
party. 
 The euro last traded at $1.4075 , compared with
$1.4078 late in New York on Monday. Early in the session, it was
as high as $1.4088.	
 The yen firmed against the dollar as the discovery of
plutonium leak at the Fukushima plant, together with the
fighting in Libya and unrest in the Middle East, stoked some
safe haven demand for the Japanese currency.	
 The dollar fell about 0.2 percent to 81.68 yen ,
moving further away from 82.00 -- the March 18 high hit after
the world's major central banks intervened to stem the yen's
strength. 
 A steady euro fostered support for gold after losing ground
on Monday. Spot gold was last $1,417.30 an ounce in
tight-range trading, compared with $1,419.50 late in New York on
Monday. It is 2 percent below the record high of $1,447.40 set
on March 24. 
 Oil prices fell for a fourth straight session after rising
on a weak dollar and the political turmoil in North Africa and
Libya.	
 Several OPEC producers have boosted output recently to make
up for supply disruptons in Libya as rebels fight government
forces.	
 Brent crude  fell 55 cents to $114.25 a barrel, while
U.S. crude  slipped 65 cents to $103.33.

 * Euro above 1-1/2 week low after Trichet comments

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - The yen ticked up versus the
dollar and euro on Tuesday as concerns about Japan's nuclear
crisis and Middle East unrest prompted flows into the
low-yielding Japanese currency, while expectations of an
interest rate hike supported the euro.	
 Risk sentiment soured after the discovery of plutonium in
soil at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant heightened alarm
over Japan's battle to contain the world's worst atomic crisis
in 25 years. [ID:nL3E7ES2ND]	
 Uncertainty over the impact of the fighting in oil producer
Libya and spreading unrest in the Middle East further clouded
the corporate earnings outlook, weighing on U.S. and Tokyo
shares.	
 The yen had come under pressure earlier this week as hawkish
comments from Federal Reserve officials raised speculation the
Fed is preparing the ground for ending its easing programme,
widening an interest rate gap in favour of the dollar.	
 ""In the near term, there are some risk aversion-related
flows from the nuclear problem and the Middle East, which are
lending support to the yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief
currency strategist at Barclays Capital.	
 ""The impact of the earthquake is not fully realised. The
current risk environment is preventing the dollar/yen from
tracking interest rate differentials.""	
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 81.55 yen , moving
further away from 82.00 -- the March 18 high hit after the
world's major central banks intervened to stem the yen's
strength.	
 A customer dealer for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo
reported a significant amount of dollar offers at and above 82
yen, mainly from Japanese exporters. 
 He also said the dollar may be pulling back after rising the
previous day, when there was talk of buying by model funds and
macro funds, adding that the dollar could fall as low
as 80.80 on Tuesday.	
 However, analysts said players would be reluctant to push
the dollar below 80 yen on worries about further intervention.	
 Rate support for the dollar waned after Fed officials said
on Monday that the U.S. economy still needed support from the
central bank's full $600 billion planned bond purchases
[ID:nN28221312].	
 ""The likely dip in confidence in the wake of the Japan
earthquake and evidence of deepening housing deflation can both
serve as reminders that the majority of FOMC members are
unlikely to consider current economic performance good enough to
meet the hurdle rate for a premature end to QE2,"" BNP Paribas
said in a note to clients.	
 The dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was slightly
higher on the day at 76.193.	
 The two-year U.S. Treasury yield had risen to a three-week
high at 0.785 percent at one stage, up more than 14
basis points in five days, widening its gap over comparable
Japanese yields.

 EURO STABILISES	
 The euro was steady at $1.4068 , stabilising above a
1-1/2 week low. The euro briefly rose above $1.41 on Monday
after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said inflation in the
euro zone is ""durably"" above the ECB's target.	
 The euro's support levels are seen at $1.4000 and $1.3997.	
 Trichet's comments reinforced expectations for a rate hike
next month and helped to relieve pressure on the single currency
from the euro zone debt crisis, with concerns rising about
Portugal's ability to finance itself.	
 ""EU periphery issues remain raw, but Trichet reminded that
the ECB remains poised to hike rates soon. The ECB Governing
Council meets on 7 April and is expected to hike rates 25 basis
points,"" David Watt, strategist at RBC, wrote in a client note.	
 Still, the common currency is not out of the woods yet with
investors closely watching the results of the European Union
bank stress tests on Thursday, where Irish banks are in focus.	
 The test of the banks' reserves under adverse scenarios is
required under the terms of the EU/IMF bailout and is expected
to show a fresh capital hole of between 18 billion and 23
billion euros, local Irish media have reported. [ID:nLDE72R05Q]	
 Sterling nursed losses after weak UK data raised questions
about how soon the Bank of England can raise rates. 
 The pound last traded at $1.5988 , having fallen as
low as $1.5937. It is seen vulnerable to a drop towards $1.5750,
after piercing $1.60. 
 In contrast, the high-flying Aussie was consolidating at
$1.0232 after striking a fresh 29-year high at $1.0315.	
 Westpac analysts said the Aussie was looking tired after
gaining 6 cents in 11 days, and looked ready for a modest
correction towards $1.02.

 * Mexico peso rises 0.15 pct, Brazil real dips 0.12 pct
 * Peru sol slumps as Humala takes lead in poll
 By Michael O'Boyle and Ursula Scollo
 MEXICO CITY, March 28 (Reuters) - Peru's sol slumped the
most in nearly two years on Monday after a poll showed a
left-wing nationalist presidential candidate leading the race,
boding further volatility in the currency.
 Investors were also wary of new measures in Brazil to
contain the real's strength, while Mexico's peso got a lift
from solid U.S. and Mexican economic data. [ID:nN28186066]
 Peru's sol hit its weakest level since December after polls
showed nationalist Ollanta Humala had narrowly taken the lead
in Peru's five-candidate race, but they also showed he would
struggle to win a run-off. [ID:nPOLLSPE]
 The sol has lost nearly 1.6 percent since Humala's support
surged in a poll released the previous weekend.
 Humala has gained by toning down radical rhetoric that hurt
him in the 2006 race. He and all other main candidates in the
race support market-friendly economic policies in place for the
last two decades.
 Business leaders still view Humala warily due to his
radical past and fear he could roll back economic reforms in
one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
 ""It is perceived that he could put the progress that has
been made over the last several years in jeopardy,"" said
Roberto Melzi, a strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.
 The Peruvian currency  bid down around 0.9 percent
to 2,813 per dollar, its worst one-day slide since June 2009.
 Melzi said the central bank could begin selling dollars to
contain losses in the currency if it weakens much more.
 Barclays expects Peru to deliver a 50-basis-point hike in
April. Melzi said that could also shore up demand for the
currency.
 The Mexican peso got some support from data showing an
unexpected February rise in sales of previously owned homes in
the United States, Mexico's leading trade partner.
Stronger-than-expected Mexican economic activity in January
also helped the currency. [ID:nN28284475] and [ID:nN28114561]
 The peso  firmed 0.15 percent to 11.9711 per dollar.
 Mexico sends around 80 percent of its exports to its
northern neighbor. Signs of economic recovery in the United
States have supported the peso during recent global financial
jitters related to Japan's earthquake and nuclear crisis and
unrest in the oil-producing Middle East and North Africa.
 Chile's peso  bid 0.33 percent weaker to 480.30,
hurt by a fall in the price of copper, the country's main
export.
 Brazil's real  bid 0.12 percent weaker at 1.660 per
dollar. Local media reported that the government will impose a
tax of probably 6 percent on foreign currency debt issued in
the private sector.
 Analysts said the plan had been expected by financial
markets and may not have much of a negative impact on the real
if it is announced.
 The government has introduced a series of measures in
recent months to contain the real's gains, which are hurting
local manufacturers.
 Financial flows into Brazil have been tempted by the huge
spread between interest rates in developed markets and Brazil's
double-digit rates.
 In October, Brazil tripled to 6 percent the so-called IOF
tax it charges foreigners when they buy local bonds. But
analysts said the lack of a tax on locals was allowing domestic
banks and companies to borrow abroad, invest in Brazil and
pocket the difference between interest rates.
 ""The market is always going to find a way to bring the
money in when you have such a huge interest rate differential,""
said Tony Volpon, head of emerging markets research for the
Americas at Nomura Securities in New York.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2011 05:08PM ET</span>",Hungary PM sees at least one more 2011 forex bond issue," * Hungary has regained financial independence-PM Orban
 * Budget ""under control"" despite surge in deficit
 * New constitution to contain clause on forint -PM
 BUDAPEST, March 29 (Reuters) - Hungary plans at least one
more foreign currency bond issue this year after the sale of
dollar-denominated bonds last week, Prime Minister Viktor Orban
told state television M1 on Monday.
 The country placed a 10-year dollar bond worth $3 billion
and a further $750 million in a 30-year bond last week amid
optimism over its fiscal reforms despite a shaky global market
environment. [ID:nLDE72N133]
 Orban said the foreign bond issues help refinance expiring
debt and demonstrate the economic independence of the country.
 His centre-right government, which came to power last year,
stunned markets when it decided not to apply for a new credit
deal with the International Monetary Fund and the European
Union. An earlier deal with the IMF and the EU helped the
indebted country survive the 2008-2009 global crisis.
 ""We have regained our financial independence,"" Orban told
television.
 The proceeds of the dollar bonds will cover more than half
of Hungary's 4 billion euro ($5.64 billion) foreign currency
debt refinancing need this year.
 When asked whether Hungary will have more foreign currency
bond issues this year, Orban said: ""There will be at least one
more.""
 Orban said the budget deficit overshot the target last year
due to a weak fiscal performance of local municipalities, which
underpinned the need for a new law to regulate the financing of
local governments.
 One-off budget revenues in the second half of 2011 will
ensure that fiscal trends remain on the right course this year
despite a surge in the budget deficit to over 80 percent of the
full-year target by February, he added.
 ""Things are under control,"" he said.
 The prime minister also said that talks with banks about
lifting a government-imposed moratorium on evictions by July
were advancing well and would be hopefully concluded in May.
 FORINT ENSHRINED IN CONSTITUTION
 He said his government planned to include a clause about
the forint in the new constitution, which the ruling Fidesz
party wants to pass in parliament in April, because ""Hungary
arranges its economic deals in the forint, and the forint must
be defended.""
 When asked what would happen in the future when the country
will adopt the euro to meet its European Union obligations, he
said: ""We will need to amend this rule then.""
 According to Hungarian laws, the constitution can be
amended only with a two-thirds parliament majority. Orban's
Fidesz party controls more than two-thirds of the votes in
parliament, and their term will end in 2014. Hungary is seen
adopting the euro only at the end of this decade.
 Orban also confirmed that his government had not abandoned
plans to freeze public utilities prices and was working on a
scheme to keep the price of district heating used by hundreds
of thousands of families unchanged in the long term.

 * Radiation increases, bad news piles up from site
 * Plant operator seeks help from French companies
 * Over 28,000 people dead or missing from March 11 disaster
(Adds details)
 By Yoko Nishikawa
 TOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - Plutonium found in soil at the
crippled Fukushima nuclear complex heightened alarm on Tuesday
over Japan's protracted battle to contain the world's worst
atomic crisis in 25 years.
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co <9501.T (TEPCO) said
the radioactive material, a by-product of atomic reactions and
also used in nuclear bombs, was traced in soil at five locations
at the complex, hit by an earthquake and tsunami on March 11.
 The drama at the six-reactor facility has compounded the
Asian nation's agony after the natural disasters left more than
28,000 people dead or missing in the devastated northeast.
 ""I apologise for making people worried,"" Sakae Muto,
vice-president of under-pressure TEPCO, said at a briefing
around midnight in Tokyo. 
 Yet he stressed the traces of plutonium 238, 239 and 240
were not dangerous and work would not be stopped.
 ""It's not at the level that's harmful to human health.""
 Muto said the readings were similar to those found in the
past in other parts of Japan due to particles carried in the
atmosphere after nuclear testing abroad.
 TEPCO said it was unclear where the plutonium was from,
though it appeared two of the five finds were related to damage
from the plant rather than from the atmosphere.
 Experts believe that as well as from the air, plutonium may
have come from spent fuel rods at Fukushima or damage to reactor
No. 3, the only one to use plutonium in its fuel mix.
 U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) IAEA, said the find was expected due to known fuel
degradation.
 The U.N. body has called a summit, possibly in June, to
coordinate the international response to mounting concern over
nuclear safety in the wake of Japan's crisis.
 Japan's own nuclear safety agency was concerned at the
plutonium samples which ranged from 0.18-0.54 becquerels per kg.
 ""While it's not the level harmful to human health, I am not
optimistic. This means the containment mechanism is being
breached so I think the situation is worrisome,"" agency official
Hidehiko Nishiyama was quoted as saying by Jiji news agency.
 The plutonium discovery, from samples taken a week ago, was
the latest bad news from the Fukushima plant where engineers are
resigned to a protracted struggle of weeks or possibly months to
reestablish cooling systems vital to control the reactors.
 On Monday, TEPCO said highly reactive water showing 1,000
millisieverts per hour had been found in concrete tunnels that
extend beyond one reactor.
 Fires, blasts and leaks have forced engineers to stop work
at times, including at the weekend when radiation spiked to
100,000 times above normal in water inside reactor No. 2.
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said a partial meltdown
of fuel rods inside the reactor vessel was responsible.
 
 APOCALYPTIC SCENES
 With Japan's towns and villages in the northeast coast
reduced to apocalyptic landscapes of mud and debris, more than a
quarter of a million people are homeless. The cost of damage
could top $300 billion, the world's costliest natural disaster.
 Environmental group Greenpeace said its experts had
confirmed dangerous radiation of up to 10 microsieverts per hour
in Iitate village, 40 km (25 miles) northwest of the plant.
 It called for the extension of a 20-km (12-mile) evacuation
zone. ""It is clearly not safe for people to remain in Iitate,
especially children and pregnant women, when it could mean
receiving the maximum allowed annual dose of radiation in only a
few days,"" Greenpeace said in a statement.
 It urged Tokyo to ""stop choosing politics over science"".
 More than 177,000 people have been evacuated from an area
within 20 km (12 miles) of the plant and people within a zone
extending a further 10 km are told by the government to stay
indoors or, better still, leave too.
 Beyond the evacuation zone, traces of radiation have been
found in tap water in Tokyo and as far away as Iceland.
 Japanese officials and international experts have generally
said the levels away from the plant were not dangerous for
people, who in any case face higher radiation doses on a daily
basis from natural sources, X-rays or flying.
 
 LEADERSHIP PROBLEMS
 TEPCO, which has conceded it faces a long and uncertain
operation to contain the crisis, sought outside help from French
firms including Electricite de France SA and Areva SA, a French
government minister said.
 Japan is also seeking American help, said Robin Grimes, head
of the centre for nuclear engineering at Imperial College in
London. ""Each country has its own expertise.""
 Mark Prelas, a professor of nuclear engineering at
University of Missouri in the United States, warned against
overreaction to the fast-moving events in Japan.
 ""It's worth remembering that millions of Americans in the
west of the country would have been exposed to tiny traces of
plutonium during the above ground bomb tests prior to the
1960s,"" he said.
 The risk of a core meltdown had receded, he added, and
hopefully water pumps would be restarted in the next couple of
weeks to get the reactors into a safe ""cold shutdown"" stage.
 ""From what I've seen so far, what has been released so far
would not require the exclusion zone to become permanent. I
don't think that's realistic. The eventual clean-up still looks
like it should be easily manageable,"" he added.
 The crisis has put huge pressure on TEPCO, which has been
criticised for safety lapses at the plant and a slow response to
the disaster. Its boss Masataka Shimizu has barely been seen.
 Prime Minister Naota Kan, leading Japan during its worst
crisis since World War Two, has been similarly low-profile.
 Even though Japan's culture stresses group efficiency over
individual charisma, many are unhappy and a weekend poll showed
two-thirds of people felt Kan was not showing leadership.
 ""The characters involved are too weak to take decisive
actions,"" said Jesper Koll, analyst at JP Morgan Securities.

 * Interest rate differential boosts dollar vs yen
 * Trichet's comments highlight chances of ECB rate hike
 * Dollar still vulnerable; market misreading Fed comments
(Recasts throughout, adds comment, detail; changes byline)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The dollar gained on the yen
on Monday as the gap between U.S. and Japanese yields widened
in the greenback's favor, but the greenback may be vulnerable
to renewed selling, especially if forthcoming U.S. jobs data
disappoints.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 0.77 percent, four
basis points above Friday's close and up 14 basis points in
five days, widening its gap over comparable Japanese yields.
 That helped push the dollar to a session peak of 81.84 yen
, its highest since March 18, when the Bank of Japan and
other major central banks intervened to stop runaway yen
gains.
 Meanwhile, the euro held above $1.40  as markets
braced for higher euro zone interest rates.
 Some upward pressure on the dollar and U.S. yields was
sparked by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve president, who on
Friday said the central bank would have to tighten policy soon
to avoid inflation.
 But analysts said the market overreacted to the comments
from the Fed's Charles Plosser, a traditional policy hawk, and
noted that recent U.S. economic data, particularly regarding
the housing market, has shown signs of weakness.
 While the Commerce Department on Monday said consumer
spending rose more than expected in February, its eighth
consecutive monthly gain, higher gas and food prices are
expected to slow spending growth in the first quarter.
[ID:nCAT005399]
 ""On balance and at the margin, the evidence is tilted in
the direction of a weak economy and no need for Fed concern
about changing its easy policy any time soon,"" said Dan Dorrow,
head of research at Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
""Recent market pricing to the contrary is an overreaction.""
 U.S. employment data is due on Friday, and economists
polled by Reuters expect 190,000 job gain in March, steady with
the 192,000 jobs added the prior month.
 EURO HOLDS FIRM
 Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman, said the euro was flashing similar signals.
While it fell Friday and hit a one-week low near $1.40
overnight, it was last up 0.1 percent at $1.4096 .
 That was well within an uptrend that persisted through last
week's credit downgrade of Portugal and expectations that it
could soon become the third indebted euro zone country to
require emergency aid.
 The market expects the European Central Bank to lift
interest rates on April 7, a view that gained credence Monday
when ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said inflation rates are
above the central bank's price stability target.[nWEA1186].
 Chandler said the euro gains may falter after an ECB rate
hike, partly on the view that the euro zone economy is too
fragile to withstand a series of interest rate hikes.
 ""But if we're going to see a 'buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact'
reaction, we still have to wait for the fact,"" he said. ""April
7 is far away for the foreign exchange world, and you could see
the euro push up another couple of big figures before then.""
 The possibility of higher interest rates as early as next
month softened concerns about Germany's ruling party losing a
key state election.
 YEN APPRECIATION A RISK
 The dollar may also drift back toward 80 yen in the near
term, said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of currency sales at
Mizuho Corporate Bank, particularly if Japanese investors
repatriate funds ahead of month end on Thursday.
 One-month dollar/yen volatility traded around 10 percent
, compared with around 20 percent when the yen rose
to a record high of 76.25 earlier this month.
 Should volatility pick up and yen gains accelerate, though,
the G7 could step in again to weaken it, Eliasson said.
 ""I don't think the BoJ has a specific level in mind,"" he
said. ""Theirs is more of a defensive strategy aimed at keeping
any further appreciation from getting too rapid.""
 Japan and other Group of Seven countries joined forces to
stem yen appreciation earlier this month after it hit a record
high near 76 per dollar.

 ABU DHABI, March 28 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is
stepping in to fill the gap from a drop in Libyan oil supply by
pumping more oil, the country's OPEC governor said on Monday.
Since the start of disruptions in Libya's oil supplies, OPEC
members have taken unilateral action to boost production. Saudi
Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has produced just
under 9 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in March.
 ""As oil exports from Libya were affected, other OPEC members
stepped in including Saudi, Kuwait, Angola and the UAE,"" Ali

damage report of infrastructure of Libya's oil production, so
once the problems are resolved, (exports) will go back to
normal.""
 Al-Yabhouni said that, with plenty of supply in the market,
he saw no sign that OPEC would meet before June. 
 ""As far as I'm aware, there is no need for an extraordinary
meeting.""
 Oil last month hit a two-and-a-half year high of nearly $120
per barrel, driven by turmoil in Libya, which had been producing
around 1.6 million bpd before protests erupted.
 Brent crude futures for May delivery rose 13 cents to

 CAPE TOWN, March 28 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's 80,000 barrel
per day (bpd) SIR refinery may be forced to shut from the middle
of next month unless it gets fresh supplies of crude oil, the
refinery's managing director said on Monday.
 The refinery, located in Abidjan, has been struggling to
secure crude oil due to European sanctions aimed at forcing
incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo from power.
 ""We still have some strategic stocks, so we have no problem
supplying the market until the end of May, but the refinery will
be stopped by mid-April if we don't get any crude,""Joel
Dervain, the refinery's managing director, told Reuters on the
sidelines of an African Refiners Association meeting.
 Dervain said the refinery was currently operating at 25,000
bpd, less than half of its capacity.
 The refinery, which also serves a number of neighbouring
countries, has been targeted by the European Union to prevent
Gbagbo from clinging onto power after an election that
U.N.-certified election results showed was won by rival Alassane
Ouattara.
 ""The measure taken by the European Union -- all the assets
that we had were frozen and we ran out of cash to pay for the
crude,"" Dervain said.
 ""We've attacked the decision in court. We are waiting for a
decision of the European Tribunal.""
 The refinery is one of a number of institutions as well as
senior civilian and military figures to be targeted by the EU,
which along with other Western and African organisations, is
trying to force Gbagbo to step down after the U.N.-monitored
poll.

* Trichet's comments soften concerns about Merkel's loss
* Monetary policy seen as key driver for euro and dollar
* Higher rates seen adding pressure to peripheral zone
(Updates prices, adds quotes)
 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro outperformed most
major currencies on Monday, with more gains likely over the
near term, given that investors believe that tighter monetary
policy by the European Central Bank is around the corner.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Monday inflation
rates are durably above the central bank's price stability
target.
 The possibility of higher interest rates as early as next
month softened concerns about Germany's ruling party losing a
key state election.
 The euro gained after Trichet's comments. It was up 0.1
percent for the day at $1.4096 after sliding as much as 0.3
percent on the back of concerns about Chancellor Angela
Merkel's loss. The euro, nevertheless, is off a 4-1/2 month
high of $1.4249 hit last week on EBS.
 The euro also fared well against the yen, gaining 0.5
percent to 115.14.
 Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York, said markets are highly
anticipating that the ECB is going to raise rates.
 ""Although Trichet says the ECB does not pre-commit, the
failure to raise rates at the April 7 meeting would likely be
disruptive,"" he said.
 The tightening of monetary policy and the strength of the
euro, however, will likely exacerbate the pressure in the
debt-strapped countries in the periphery, he said.
 ""Although the periphery is a relatively small part of the
euro-zone GDP, the potential contagion and political fallout
still needs to be reckoned with,"" he said.
 Merkel's conservatives' loss on Sunday after the vote in
Germany's region of Baden-Wuertemberg, which they had held for
nearly six decades, led markets to bet that she will have less
leeway to shore up financially stricken members of the single
currency bloc.
 But expectations of an interest-rate increase in the euro
zone continue to offset worries about heavily indebted
Portugal and Spain.
 Near-term euro support lies at the 20-day moving average
near $1.40, and trendline support around $1.3975, which is
drawn through the euro's Jan. 10 low of $1.2860 and its March
11 low of $1.3752.
 The U.S. dollar index was down 0.1 percent at 76.118 and
has been bouncing around a 15-month low. Monetary policy
should remain a key driver for the dollar and recent hawkish
comments from Federal Reserve officials have highlighted how
sensitive the greenback has become to any potential shift in
the stance at the central bank.
""A shift to a more hawkish stance at the Fed, is an
important risk to our USD bear view,"" said Camilla Sutton,
chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
""However, we continue to believe that the Fed will remain on
hold for many quarters to come, and prove one of the last
central banks to finally tighten policy.""
 This, in the medium term, should prove a weight against
the dollar, she said.
 U.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than expected in
February for the eighth straight month of gains as households
tapped their savings, U.S. Commerce Department data showed on
Monday, while inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since
June 2009.
 Data on the U.S. housing market, meanwhile, showed
strength.
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 81.64 yen with implied
volatilities staying low, which traders said was ruling out
the need for any further official yen selling intervention in
the near-term.
 One-month dollar/yen volatility traded around 10 percent,
compared with around 20 percent when the yen rose to a record
high of 76.25 earlier this month.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2011 12:28PM ET</span>",Libyan oil still blocked despite rebels' deal," * Sanctions clarification important but more needed
 * Shipping and legal risks to play a major role
 * No clarity how Qatar can market Libyan oil
 
 By Ikuko Kurahone and Dmitry Zhdannikov
 LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - Europe's prospects of receiving
Libyan oil shipments would be weeks away even if rebels were
quickly removed from the international sanctions list, as big
buyers say shipping and legal risks are still a concern.
 A senior Libyan rebel official said on Sunday Gulf oil
producer Qatar had agreed to market oil produced from east
Libyan fields that are no longer under the control of Muammar
Gaddafi.. On Monday, Qatar became the first Arab country to
recognise Libya's rebels. 
 Trading sources told Reuters they didn't think the latest
developments changed anything about the status of Libyan oil,
whose shipments have been suspended for weeks due to U.S., U.N.
and EU sanctions and heavy fighting.
 ""I still cannot touch this crude. I guess dozens of things
need to happen -- both internally and externally -- for me to
start looking at it again,"" said a trader with an oil major.
 Two Italian firms, which have previously been among major
buyers, also said they had not yet been approached by rebels,
although offers to sell crude were still coming from Libya's
National Oil Co, controlled by the government.
 ""Even though Qatar recognised rebels in Libya, this is not
in line with the United Nations resolutions. We all have to
comply with U.N. sanctions,"" a trader with an Italian firm said.
 The rebel official in charge of the economy, Ali Tarhouni,
said over the weekend he expected the next shipment to take
place in less than a week and that an escrow account monitored
by auditors had been set up.
 Libya produced about 1.6 million barrels of oil per day
before the crisis, or almost 2 percent of world output. 
 Emboldened by the Western-led air strikes against Gaddafi's
forces, the rebels have quickly reversed earlier losses and
regained control of all the main oil terminals in the east of
the OPEC member country.
 
 CLEAR TITLE
 International sanctions are designed to cut off funding to
Gaddafi, and the U.S. government has said the list of targeted
companies could change should they come under different
ownership, while EU sanctions omitted rebel oil firm Agoco from
the list.
 However, trading and shipping sources said a clarification
of sanctions would not immediately reopen business.
 ""It goes beyond the sanctions issue. It's all about having
clear title. You have to be 110 percent sure you have legal
title, and it will take months to sort it out. You want to know
who you are paying,"" said an oil trader working for a bank.
 ""We need to understand are we are trading with, what sort of
company is selling crude, who controls it, who manages it. Can
we sign ship-owners to the area, and if we can, what sort of
risk premium we are talking about,"" the trader with a major oil
company said.
 Ship brokers said there had been no indications of fresh
cargoes being booked from Libya.
 ""It will be hard to find an owner willing to enter in to
Libyan waters due to safety,"" a shipping source said.
 Shipping sources have also said Western sanctions on Libya's
government have already hurt shipping, with a virtual shutdown
of its vital seaborne trade on the cards.
 John Drake, a senior risk consultant at UK-based consultancy
Ake, said a major problem would be to bring back specialist
staff to get operations at fields and ports restarted.
 ""Insurance may also be more of a challenge. It's also
difficult at the moment to know what kind of authorities you
might be dealing with in the rebel areas.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on signs
of a brighter economic outlook while the euro rose against the
dollar on Monday after concerns eased following the rout of
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party in elections.
 Growing speculation that the European Central Bank will
raise interest rates as early as next month supported the euro,
which climbed to a session peak of $1.4115 after data on
contracts for U.S. home sales for February showed an unexpected
rise.
 The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home
Sales Index, based on contracts signed in February but not yet
closed, rose 2.1 percent to 90.8. Economists had expected the
index, which leads existing home sales by a month or two, to
fall 1.0 percent. For details see: [ID:nWALSEE73Y].
 Global stocks gained as an upgrade of U.S. telecom shares
and a rise in U.S. consumer spending in February lifted
sentiment.
 U.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than forecast as
households tapped their savings to cover higher food and energy
prices, while inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since
June 2009. [ID:nCAT005399]
 While Japan's nuclear disaster and civil unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa still hang over markets, much of
the losses over recent weeks have been recouped.
 ""To some degree investors have become used to the bad news
that's out there, and things continue to look good
domestically,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist
at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.
 The S&P telecom sector <.GSPL> rose 1.3 percent after
Robert W. Baird upgraded a number of telecoms to ""outperform,""
including Dow members AT&T Inc  and Verizon Communications
Inc , saying AT&T's deal to buy T-Mobile would help
stabilize the hyper-competitive industry. [ID:nL3E7ES19O]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 21.04
points, or 0.17 percent, at 12,241.63. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 1.98 points, or 0.15 percent, at
1,315.78. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.02
points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,746.08.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was up 0.1 percent at 1.125.65 points.
 Brent crude rebounded as rebels regained control of key oil
towns in Libya. [ID:nL3E7ES07Y]
 North Sea Brent for May delivery  rose 18 cents to
$115.77 a barrel.
 U.S. Treasuries slipped as traders trimmed positions to
make way for new supply and looked ahead to mid-year when the
Federal Reserve's program of buying Treasuries is set to end.
 The government data showing U.S. personal spending and
inflation accelerated in February also weighed on prices.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  pared
some losses, off 5/32 in price to yield 3.46 percent.
 The dollar was down against a basket of trading-partner
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.16 percent
at 76.097.
 The loss by Merkel's party in Baden-Wuertemberg, which the
conservatives had held for nearly six decades, led markets to
bet the chancellor will have less leeway to shore up
financially stricken members of the single currency bloc.
 But expectations of a euro-zone interest rate rise continue
to offset worries about heavily indebted Portugal and Spain.

above its price stability target. [nWEA1186][ID:nLDE72Q0E6]

 AMSTERDAM, March 28 (Reuters) - Libyan-controlled oil
company Tamoil has lodged a complaint before a Dutch court
against oil major Royal Dutch Shell over halting fuel supplies,
a Tamoil spokesman said on Monday.
 The court in Rotterdam will rule on the legality of Shell's
decision to stop supplying nine gas stations in the Netherlands,
which operate under the Shell brand but are owned by Tamoil.
 Major international oil firms BP and Shell have stopped
supplying oil to Tamoil because of international sanctions.
 ""The hearing is scheduled for Thursday, March 31 in
Rotterdam,"" Tamoil's Frank Kromer told Reuters. ""The ruling
could come in the next week or two.""
 Kromer said Tamoil is questioning the legality of Shell's
move, because the company is not on the European Union list of
sanctions.
 He said Tamoil has found other suppliers for its petrol
stations in the Netherlands and will continue to work with them
until the issue with Shell is resolved.
 ""Tamoil has started a legal proceeding, and we await this
with confidence,"" a Shell spokesman in The Hague told Reuters.
""As you know we have suspended all business agreements with
companies and organisations controlled by the Libyan government,
and this is how we support EU sanctions imposed against Libya,""
he said.
 Tamoil runs around 3,000 gas stations in Italy, Germany,
Switzerland, Netherlands and Spain, according to its Dutch web
site.
 But its refineries in Italy, Germany and Switzerland will be
hit by disruptions as well.
On Friday, Tamoil's Swiss refining unit said it had brought
forward a full maintenance shutdown at its 72,000 barrel-per-day
Collombey refinery by two months to April, partly due to
concerns about the impact of sanctions.

 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro was flat against
the dollar on Monday as expectations that the European Central

 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro erased losses
against the dollar on Monday as expectations that the European
Central Bank will tighten monetary policy as early as next
month softened concerns about Germany's ruling party losing a
key state election.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on Monday said inflation
rates are durably above its price stability target.
 The euro erased losses after Trichet's comments and was
last trading flat on the day at $1.4074 after sliding as much
as 0.3 percent lower on the back of concerns about Chancellor
Angela Merkel's loss. The euro, nevertheless, is off a 4-1/2
month high of $1.4249 hit last week on EBS.
 While the loss by Merkel's conservatives of
Baden-Wuertemberg, which they had held for nearly six decades,
led markets to bet Merkel will have less leeway to shore up

expectations of a euro-zone interest rate rise continue to
offset worries about heavily indebted Portugal and Spain.
 ""The effect should be seen in less freedom for the German
government to take unpopular political stands, such as in
nuclear power and economic assistance to periphery countries,""
Brown Brothers Harriman said in a note. ""This does not bode
well for the periphery, in light of near term issues with
Ireland and Portugal.""
 Irish bank stress tests are to be released Thursday and
forecasts have 20 billion euros as the additional capital
required.
 Near-term euro support lies at the 20-day moving average
near $1.40, and trendline support around $1.3975, which is
drawn through the euro's Jan. 10 low of $1.2860 and March 11
low of $1.3752.
 While the euro should stay under pressure in the short run
on concern about a worsening debt crisis in Portugal following
the collapse of the country's government, the euro should be
supported as long as it holds above $1.40. Expectations of a
euro-zone interest rate rise as early as next month have mostly
offset worries about heavily indebted Portugal and Spain.
 The U.S. dollar index was flat at 76.202, bouncing from a
recent 15-month low. Monetary policy should remain a key driver
for the dollar, with Friday's reaction to Philadelphia Fed
President Plosser's speech highlighting how sensitive the
greenback has become to any potential shift in the stance at
the Fed. Plosser said the Fed needs to lean against inflation.
 ""A shift to a more hawkish stance at the Fed, is an
important risk to our USD bear view,"" said Camilla Sutton,
chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
""However, we continue to believe that the Fed will remain on
hold for many quarters to come and prove one of the last
central bank to finally tighten policy.""
 This, in the medium term, should prove a weight against the
dollar, she said.
 U.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than expected in
February for the eighth straight month of gains as households
tapped their savings, U.S. Commerce Department data showed on
Monday, while inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since
June 2009.
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 81.67 yen with implied
volatilities staying low, which traders said was ruling out the
need for any further official yen selling intervention in the
near-term.
 One-month dollar/yen vol traded around 10 percent, compared
with around 20 percent when the yen rose to a record high of
76.25 earlier this month.

 By Anirban Nag and Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro eased on Monday,
heading into a cluster of Asian demand and technical support,
after Germany's ruling party lost a key state election, while
hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials lifted the dollar.
 The loss by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives of
Baden-Wuertemberg, which they had held for nearly six decades,
led markets to bet Merkel will have less leeway to shore up
financially stricken members of the single currency bloc.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar , hit a
29-year peak of $1.0315, breaking past option barriers at $1.03.
Recent intervention to weaken the yen and stronger risk appetite
were factors underpinning the Aussie's rise, traders said.
 For the euro, the failure to break through option barriers
near $1.4250 last week saw some paring of speculative long
positions, moving it towards reported Asian central bank bids at
$1.4030/10.
 ""It is a combination of setbacks to German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's party and the dollar being lifted by those comments
from Fed officials which led some investors to short the euro,""
said Adam Myers, senior currency strategist at Credit Agricole.
 The euro  was down 0.2 percent to $1.4044, off a 4-1/2
month high of $1.4249 hit last week on EBS. It fell to around
$1.4020 in the Asian session.
 Near-term support lies at the 20-day moving average near
$1.40, and trendline support around $1.3975, which is drawn
through the euro's Jan. 10 low of $1.2860 and March 11 low of
$1.3752.
 ""Events provide downside risks (for the euro) in our
opinion,"" said fx analysts at Barclays Capital in a note.
 ""These include discussion over bank funding and
recapitalisation in Ireland ahead of the bank stress-test
results (published on 31 March), concerns about Portugal, and
about the impact of potentially waning political support in
Germany for its financial contribution to the euro rescue
package,"" said fx analysts at Barclays in a note.
 The euro had been due for a pull-back, and the dollar for a
bounce, judging from market positioning. Latest data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows speculators raised
the value of dollar net short positions to $29.82 billion in the
week ended March 22, up from $27.07 billion. [IMM/FX]
 
 DOLLAR MOVING UP
 Sunday's election loss to the Greens, who surged to their
first premiership in Baden-Wuerttemberg, was the second defeat
for Merkel's Christian Democrats in states usually regarded as
strongholds for the party. [ID:nLDE72Q0E6]
 The defeat was blamed on Merkel's reversal of nuclear policy
following Japan's nuclear crisis and foreign policy issues, but
could cast doubt on whether Merkel's policy on Europe has the
support of the German people.
 Losses in the currency are likely to be limited, however,
with the European Central Bank still expected to raise rates
next month. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet speaks at 1300 GMT
and is likely to reiterate his hawkish stance towards inflation.
 The dollar meanwhile held on to Friday's gains sparked by
hawkish comments from regional Fed officials Charles Plosser and
James Bullard. [ID:nLDE72O009][ID:nLDE72O1T3]
 ""Comments from Bullard, who is a cheerleader for
quantitative easing, shows a sea-change as to whether the
endgame for QE2 is approaching,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of
currency strategy at CIBC.
 ""If we get reasonably supportive ISM manufacturing data and
U.S. payrolls this week, we could see the dollar index testing
its 50-day moving average.""
 The dollar index edged up 0.2 percent to 76.348 <.DXY>,
pulling away from a 15-month low of 75.340 set on March 21. Its
50-day moving average comes in at 77.285 on Monday. 
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 81.70 yen with implied
volatilities staying low, which traders said was ruling out the
need for any further official yen selling intervention in the
near-term.
 One-month dollar/yen vol traded around 10 percent ,

Unilever Plc became the first European company to tap
the growing offshore yuan market by raising $46 million, amid
signs of a pickup in issuance activity after a slow start to the
year.	
 The maker of Knorr soups and Dove soap joins a growing list
of issuers that includes casino operators and Chinese state-run
banks as Beijing seeks to increase use of the Chinese currency
in international trade. 
 The deal was priced at 1.15 percent, 10 basis points cheaper
than an initial guidance of 1.25 percent, and the multinational
raised 300 million yuan bankers familiar with the matter
said. 
 Yuan-denominated debt, or ""dim sum"" bonds as they
are known, have been snapped up by hungry investors who are
betting on further yuan gains, driving yields steadily lower in
this market since its launch last July. 
 U.S. fast food group McDonald's Corp was the first
foreign company to sell bonds at 3 percent last August followed
by Caterpillar Inc , which raised 1 billion yuan at 2
percent.	
 In another sign that activity in the dim sum bond market is
heating up, Singamas Container Holdings Ltd has
mandated three banks for an offshore yuan bond, although size
and tenor has not been decided yet.	
 New yuan bond sales could triple to 120 billion yuan this
year as a big pipeline of issuers including big state-run banks
await final approval from the mainland Chinese authorities, RBS
analysts said last week.	
 So far this year, yuan bond sales have been at a low 14
billion yuan because of geopolitical developments and general
market uncertainty. Yuan bond issues in Hong Kong last year
totalled about 40 billion yuan, with the majority in the second
half of the year.	
 Unilever and its dim Sum bond were rated ""A1"" by Moody's and
""A+"" by S&P. The settlement date is March 31.	
 Deutsche Bank AG  and HSBC Holdings Plc
were the arrangers of the Unilever deal.

 * Inflation to tumble to 1.5 percent by middle of 2012
 * Wages will not drive up future inflation
(Recasts with analyst reaction, detail)
 By David Milliken and Karolina Tagaris
 LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker
Adam Posen will not seek a second term on the Monetary Policy
Committee if his persistent lone call for more quantitative
easing proves to have been a mistake.
 In an interview with the Guardian newspaper published on
Monday, Posen said he was still convinced that a looming slump
in inflation would vindicate his call since October for an extra
50 billion pounds to be pumped into the economy.
 ""If I have made the wrong call, not only will I switch my
vote, I would not pursue a second term. They should have
somebody who gets it right and not me. I am accountable for my
performance. I'm holding my nerve because it is the right thing
to do,"" he said.
 Inflation has been more than double the BoE's 2 percent
target so far this year, and the balance of argument on the
nine-member MPC is shifting away from Posen, with three members
voting for a rate rise in both February and March's meetings.
 Nomura economist Peter Westaway, who used to work at the
BoE, said he was shocked by Posen's statement.
 ""That's unprecedented in my experience. Not even David
Blanchflower threatened to step down,"" he said, referring to a
dovish predecessor of Posen who had a jaundiced relationship
with other members of the MPC.
 Posen's three-year term on the MPC expires at the end of
August 2012, but can be renewed once.
 One print edition of the Guardian carried the headline ""Bank
of England dove predicts 1.5 percent inflation -- or he'll
quit"", though Posen's direct quotes in the article tied his
departure to the appropriateness of QE rather than a specific
inflation forecast.
 Posen does expect inflation to fall to 1.5 percent by the
middle of next year, a bigger fall than that expected by most of
the rest of the council. The BoE's February inflation report
shows a roughly one in three chance of inflation being 1.5
percent or lower in the second half of 2012.
 The central forecast was for inflation to peak at around 4.5
percent in the third quarter of this year, before falling
steadily to return to its 2 percent target 12 months later.
 Westaway said that he forecast inflation dropping as low as
1.6 percent in November 2012, and that 1.5 percent inflation was
not an unreasonable forecast either -- though he believed it
would rise soon thereafter.
 British financial markets did not move after Posen's
comments, with short sterling futures in fact pricing in a
marginally faster pace of rate-tightening than on Friday.
 ""It's a slightly melodramatic statement by Adam,"" Westaway
said. ""He's always been one who enjoys debate, and now feels as
if the debate is shifting towards the ones who are wanting to
raise interest rates.""
 
 NO WAGE RISK
 Posen disputed the view of those calling for higher interest
rates that wage rises were likely to put upward pressure on
inflation next year.
 ""Wages will be the dog that doesn't bark,"" he said.
Reiterating his commitment to more QE, he said: ""I have laid
awake at night thinking about it.""
 ""It would not just be terrible that I had messed up for
other people but it is also my fundamental world view that I
have been testing.""
 Posen's call for more QE finds little support from most
other economists.
 ""He thinks the consumer is under extreme pressure, and we've
some sympathy with this,"" said Royal Bank of Scotland economist
Ross Walker. ""I'm personally not sympathetic to more QE. Even if
we knew that inflation was going to be 1.5 percent, it's not a
dramatic undershoot.""

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2011 06:48AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Russia could invest in EFSF in 2011 if liquid enough," By Elena Fabrichnaya
 MOSCOW, March 28 (Reuters) - Russia may invest some of its
$500 billion reserves in the bonds of the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) this year if the bonds prove
sufficiently liquid, a senior central banker told Reuters.
 ""If we see that it is sufficiently liquid, we will consider
it as an investment instrument,"" central bank deputy chairman
Sergei Shvetsov said. ""Yes, it is possible already this year.""
 Unlike the Finance Ministry, the central bank does not need
any changes in the law to invest in the EFSF paper, he said.
 Russia -- which holds the world's third-largest reserves
after China and Japan -- currently does not have any investments
in Spanish bonds after all its holdings matured, but does not
rule out such investments in the future, Shvetsov said.
 ""Spain has a suitable rating. The situation is difficult
today, and thus we do not have such investments. But that does
not mean that we have renounced investment in Spanish sovereign
debt for good,"" he said.
 The Finance Ministry this month added Spain back to the list
of possible investments for its National Welfare Fund, managed
by the central bank as part of the reserves.
 It had excluded Spain from its list of permissible
investments at the height of the euro zone debt crisis last
autumn, along with Ireland, which remains off limits.
 Shvetsov reiterated that Russia has no plans to reduce its
holdings of Japanese yen in the forex component of its reserves
from the current 2 percent.
 The Canadian dollar, which was added to the reserves last
year as part of a long-term diversification strategy, accounts
for ""slightly less"" than the yen. Russia still plans to add the
Australian dollar to its reserves in the future but not this
year, he said.
 Gold holdings in the reserves is currently worth $36
billion, and Shvetsov said their value would probably continue
to rise as overall reserves grow -- even if gold's percentage
share may remain unchanged.

official who has direct knowledge of the situation said on
Monday.	
 Normally the tariff commission of China's Ministry of

changes to the tariffs effective from July 1. Another meeting in
September or October would draft tariff changes as of Jan 1.

imminent tax cut on imports of various agricultural crops and

 Earlier this year China's Ministry of Commerce asked other
ministries for opinions on a proposal to cut taxes on a range of
imports, including agricultural commodities and high-tech
products, sources told Reuters in February. [ID:nL3E7DH0TO]	
 So far there has been no conclusion or agreement on the
proposal for agricultural goods, although a document has been
issued to encourage state owned companies to import
manufacturing machinery and high-tech products, the source said.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro weakened on Monday
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives were
routed in elections in a key state, while world shares eased
back after their recent rally.
 Wall Street looked set to open flat to slightly higher after
the S&P 500 <.SPX> had its best week in seven.
 Concerns also lingered in equity markets about reports of
soaring radiation levels at a damaged nuclear plant in Japan,
and about the impact of the fighting in oil-producer Libya,
although oil prices slipped back to $115.18 a barrel after
rebels regained control of key Libyan oil towns.
 Merkel's conservatives lost power in regional stronghold
Baden-Wuerttemberg on Sunday, with early poll results showing
the Greens, buoyed by Japan's nuclear crisis, surging to their
first state premiership. [ID:nLDE72Q0E6]
 Barclays Capital said in a note that the result meant
Merkel, the leader of Europe's largest economy, would be more
reliant on support from opposition parties and that it could
feed uncertainty about political support for a euro zone bailout
package.
 The euro eased against the dollar as a result, down 0.3
percent to around $1.4040  but the dollar was also aided
by hawkish comments from some Federal Reserve officials.
 ""It is a combination of setbacks to German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's party and the U.S. dollar being lifted by those
comments from the Fed officials which led some investors to
short the euro,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency strategist at
Credit Agricole.
 St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on
Saturday that lengthening the ""extended period"" of low interest
rates could encourage a liquidity trap. [ID:nL3E7EQ03Q]
 His remarks followed comments on Friday from Philadelphia
Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser, who said the Fed
would have to reverse its easy money policy in the
""not-too-distant future"" to avoid sowing the seeds of inflation.
[ID:nDZE7DA02M]

 WEAKER SHARES
 World shares as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
around 0.3 percent with the pan-European FTSEurofirst <.FTEU3>
up 0.1 percent.
Japan's Nikkei <.N225> earlier closed down 0.6 percent.
The slip in global sentiment followed a fairly strong rally
last week that belied the overall negative news from
disaster-hit Japan and turmoil in the Arab world.
 ""We had a nice bounce last week. Markets have been resilient
in the face of some hideous news,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart,
director at Seven Investment Management.
 The Western-led military intervention in Libya was allowing
rebel forces to gain ground. Syria deployed its army to the
country's main port over the weekend in an attempt to rein in
spreading protests across the country, while in Yemen talks
stalled between the government and opposition. [ID:nLDE72Q0C3]
[ID:nLDE72Q054]
 The price of crude fell though, with Brent  down 50
cents at just over $115 a barrel after Libyan rebels regained
control of key oil towns and a rebel official said oil output
could be increased. [O/R]
 The price of gold  fell nearly 1 percent, pressured by
a firmer dollar.
 In bond markets, German government bond prices traded lower
after the election result.
 Yields on Portuguese government bonds, meanwhile, hit new
euro lifetime highs after Standard & Poor's cut the credit
ratings of five Portuguese banks.
 Yields on five-year bonds  jumped to as high as
8.764 percent, putting further pressure on Lisbon to seek an
international bailout as it faces snap elections which could
make it difficult for Lisbon to finance itself ahead of bond
redemptions in April and June. [ID:nLDE72P0DF]

 * Euro eyes Asian support clustered $1.4030/10
 * Hawkish comments from some Fed officials help dollar
 
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro eased on Monday and
could fall toward mid-March lows after a state election loss by
Germany's ruling party raised doubts about the tackling of
Europe's debt crisis, while the dollar was aided by hawkish
comments from Federal Reserve officials.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar, hit a 29-year peak of
$1.0307, breaking past option barriers at $1.03. The recent
yen-weakening intervention and stronger risk appetite were
factors underpinning the Aussie's rise, traders said.
 For the euro, the failure to break through option barriers
around $1.4250 last week saw some paring in speculative long
positions, although support around $1.4015/35 appeared to be
holding for now with bids by Asian central banks around $1.4030
were also cited.
 ""It is a combination of setbacks to German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's party and the dollar being lifted by those comments
from Fed officials which led some investors to short the euro,""
said Adam Myers, senior currency strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""Those positions could get squeezed out and that could see
the euro rise towards $1.4125, but beyond that looks unlikely.
The chips in the table are moving as we could see positive
dollar sentiment dominate.""
 The euro was down 0.1 percent to $1.4070, off a 4-1/2 month
high of $1.4249 hit last week on EBS. It fell to around $1.4020
earlier, after having triggered stops below $1.4050.
 The euro has support at the 20-day moving average near
$1.40, and trendline support around $1.3975, which is drawn
through the euro's Jan. 10 low of $1.2860 and March 11 low of
$1.3752.
 A drop through such support could open the way for further
falls, with Credit Agricole's Myer adding that it could drop to
around $1.3850--its low on March 15.
 The euro had been due for a pull-back, and the dollar due
for a bounce, judging from market positioning. Latest data from
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows speculators
raised the value of dollar net short positions to $29.82 billion
in the week ended March 22, up from $27.07 billion.
 
 DOLLAR MOVING UP
 Merkel's conservatives lost power in a regional stronghold
on Sunday, with early poll results showing the Greens, buoyed by
Japan's nuclear crisis, surging to their first premiership in
the Baden-Wuerttemberg state.
 Losing two elections in a row in states where there is
normally strong support have cast doubts about whether Merkel's
policy on Europe has the support of the German people. This
could call into question Germany's role with respect to the
bailout fund and any future agreements.
 This uncertainty could cause peripheral bond spreads to
widen and weigh on the euro this week.
 Still, the ECB seems to be on track for a rate hike next
month with Governing Board member Ewald Nowotny on Sunday saying
it wanted to move towards a more ""normal"" monetary policy
despite recent events in Japan.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet speaks
at 1300 GMT and is likely to reiterate his hawkish stance
towards inflation.
 Meanwhile, the dollar held on to Friday's gains sparked by
hawkish comments from regional Fed officials.
 Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser,
a well-known inflation hawk, said on Friday the U.S. central
bank will have to reverse its easy money policy in the
""not-too-distant future"" to avoid sowing the seeds of inflation.
 Plosser's comments were supported by St. Louis Federal
Reserve President James Bullard, who said on Saturday that
lengthening the 'extended period' of low rates could encourage a
liquidity trap.
 ""The prospect of further QE is looking ever more remote and
the market is probably still unsure how to respond to liquidity
to withdrawal,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at USB. 
 ""With key data prints this week expected to offer further
confirmation of improving conditions in the U.S....the stage may
be set for a dollar to once again attempt to recover its growth
currency status.""
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, edged up 0.24 percent to 76.40, pulling
well away from a 15-month low of 75.340 set on March 21.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.5 percent to about 81.71
yen, pulling away from a record low of 76.25 yen struck on March
17, when the yen jumped on stop-loss buying by retail margin
traders and as option barriers were taken out.

$400 million loan for a river bridge in Bangladesh, as it
focuses instead on reconstruction at home following the March 11
earthquake and tsunami, a senior Bangladeshi official said on
Monday.	
 ""Tokyo has officially conveyed this to us as the country
needs to focus more on reconstructing its quake and
tsunami-battered economy,"" said Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan,
secretary of the economic relations division at the finance
ministry.	
 The loan agreement with Japan was scheduled to be signed

 The Japanese government was part of an international
consortium, led by the World Bank, that agreed last year to lend
Bangladesh up to $2.9 billion for the 6-km (3.8 mile)
multi-purpose bridge over the river Padma.	
 Musharraf said the project would go ahead as planned despite
the delay over the Japanese loan, as the other lenders including
the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Islamic Development
Bank, will make funds available as promised.	
 Construction of the bridge -- which should boost the south
Asian country's economy by linking the underdeveloped southwest
with the capital Dhaka and the main Chittagong port -- is due to
begin this year and complete in 2015.

 By Richard Leong	
 HONG KONG, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives were
routed in elections in a key state, while Asian shares fell as
turmoil in the Middle East and Japan's nuclear crisis left
investors with little appetite for riskier assets.	
 European shares also dipped in early trade, while U.S.
stock index futures  pared initial gains to stand little
changed.	
 Investors in Asia booked profits on bank shares in Hong
Kong, computer maker stocks in Taiwan and in mining shares in
Australia, weighing on the region's equity markets after those
sectors racked up solid gains over the last week.	
 However, most analysts reckoned Asian stock markets would
bounce back on foreign demand after the first quarter and
Japan's fiscal year comes to a close later this week.	
 ""There's still room to rise as foreign buying on dips is
likely to continue, although trading may be directionless before
the end of the fiscal year,"" said Hajime Nakajima, a wholesale
trader at Cosmo Securities in Tokyo. 
 Japan's Nikkei finished down 0.6 percent. Shares
elsewhere in Asia were mainly weaker, with MSCI's index of Asian
shares outside Japan easing 0.4 percent.	
 
 
 
 GERMAN ELECTION HURTS EURO	
 Merkel's Christian Democrats lost power on Sunday in the
rich state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where a rush of anti-nuclear
sentiment following Japan's nuclear crisis mobilised voters
against the party, which has been supportive of nuclear power.	
 The loss of the regional stronghold could limit Merkel's
ability to pass legislation as her coalition centre-right
government deals with nuclear power, military action in Libya
and the euro zone debt crisis. See [ID:nLDE72Q0E6]	
 While erosion of Merkel's clout at home weighed on the euro,
prospects of a European Central Bank rate was an important
element holding up the single currency, Gibbs said.	
 ""Clearly risks are rising, but not sufficient to tip the
euro over the edge yet. There's also a range of support on the
way down, it's not going to collapse even if it falls through
$1.40,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in Sydney. 
 The euro last traded at $1.4061 , compared with
$1.4065 late in New York on Friday. Early in the session, it was
marked down to around $1.4020.	
 Along with its gains versus the euro, the dollar firmed
against the yen , helped by Friday's comments from a U.S.
central bank official who said the Federal Reserve is poised in
the ""not-too-distant future"" to begin rolling back its super
loose monetary policy to avert inflation.	
 Easier U.S. policy has helped boost global financial markets
by flooding them with cheap money in search of higher returns,
though it has also added to inflationary pressures in emerging
economies.	
 The U.S. dollar last traded at 81.70 yen, up from 81.43 late
Friday in New York.	
 Further Western air strikes in Libya and tension in Syria,
Yemen and Bahrain continued to fuel investor uneasiness over
supply disruptions from the oil-rich Middle East and from North
Africa, supporting so-called safe havens such gold.	
 Spot gold was last at $1,423.49 an ounce, down from
Friday and below a record high of $1,447.40 reached on March 24.
It still up about 2 percent since March 15. 
 U.S. crude oil futures  fell 30 cents to $105.09 a
barrel and Brent crude  was down 26 cents at $115.33.

 * Rises could be minor stumbling block to inflation fight
 * Government sensitive to inflation expectations
 * Moves Monday to cap prices on certain drugs

(Adds comment and background from Unilever)
 By Jason Subler and Melanie Lee
 SHANGHAI, March 28 (Reuters) - Consumer goods giants Procter
& Gamble and Unilever will both raise detergent and soap prices
in China by up to 15 percent next month, local media reported,
underscoring the battle the government faces with inflation.
 Policy makers in the world's second-largest economy have
been racing to contain consumer prices, which rose 4.9 percent
in February from a year earlier, to prevent inflationary
expectations from settling in and contributing to further rises
in the prices of everything from broccoli to beer.
 State television on Monday showed images of empty store
shelves in some Chinese cities as residents raced to pick up P&G
and Unilever products before the price rises went into effect,
highlighting the sensitivity to prices of especially poorer
Chinese people, who are hit hardest by inflation.
 Unilever confirmed there will be price rises across its
portfolio to offset hikes in raw material costs but did give
details after the Shanghai Daily said they would be up to 15
percent. P&G could not be reached for comment.
 The two companies, which sell a variety of products
including shampoo, bath lotion and toothpaste, have a
significant portion of the consumer goods market in China.
 Anglo-Dutch Unilever has said raw material costs will rise
by 4 percent of its turnover in 2011 which analysts calculate as
a rise of 12 percent as prices of vegetable oils, crude oil and
packaging have risen sharply, but it hopes to offset these by
rising its own prices and making cost savings.
 Unilever has the highest proportion of sales from emerging
countries, at 53 percent, compared to other big consumer goods
groups and said it had a particularly strong year in China
during 2010 with products such as Omo detergents, Clear and Dove
shampoos, Rexona deodorants, Lipton tea and Wall's ice cream.
 The group saw its fastest growth in 2010 from emerging
markets despite tougher competition, and sees these areas as key
as it aims to grow ahead of its market and push up margins.
 Unilever Plc shares were up 0.5 percent at 1,895 pence by
1139 GMT in a slightly firmer London stock market.
 Economists said they did not think the price rises would
impact the government's fight against inflation significantly.
 ""I'm sure there has been a lot of monetary policy
tightening, and if that's the case, then inflation will start to
come down,"" said Paul Cavey, an economist at Macquarie in Hong
Kong. ""This doesn't really change our view on that, although it
could make getting there a bit more difficult.""
 China does not publish the makeup of its consumer price
basket, but bank economists estimate the ""health, medical and
personal products"" category, within which consumer products
fall, has a weighting of about 9.5 percent.
 
 UNDER CONTROL?
 China has raised interest rates and banks' required reserves
multiple times in the past several months in an effort to tame
inflation, which has stabilised at under 5 percent after hitting
a peak of 5.1 percent in November.
 Although food is the main driver of consumer price
pressures, the government wants to prevent inflation
expectations growing. There are some signs its efforts are
starting to take effect. A central bank survey released this
month showed more households were satisfied with current price
levels and saw less chance of rising inflation.
 A flash purchasing managers' index (PMI) from HSBC Markit
last week showed that rises in factory input prices were their
slowest in at least half a year and increases in output prices
their weakest in seven months.
 With overall rises in the prices of raw materials slowing
from last year and Chinese monetary policy now tighter, Cavey
said he thought China could keep the situation under control.
 ""Now, commodity prices aren't rising so quickly, monetary
policy has been tightened domestically. There is still some
inflation, but the government is getting ahead of the curve. I'm
not that worried about inflation in the second half,"" he said.
 Yi Yang, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China,
said last week that China was facing strong price pressures but
inflation in the second half of the year would be lower.
 ""So for the year, we will be able to meet the 4 percent
goal,"" he told a business conference in Hong Kong, referring to
the government's 2011 inflation target.
 Still, policymakers are sensitive to rising prices, so on
Monday required hospitals and clinics nationwide to cap the
price of certain drugs..
 Planned price rises by P&G, Unilever and other Western
companies have also drawn the attention of the public and
authorities. Shanghai's Development and Reform Commission, the
local planning body, is investigating the matter of P&G and
Unilever raising prices, the Shanghai Daily said.
 Earlier this month, P&G said it would raise its U.S.
detergent prices by 4.5 percent in June in response to rising
costs of raw materials, packaging and transport.
 Global commodity prices have risen sharply in the past year.
Commodity prices, measured by the Reuters-Jefferies price index
, reached their highest levels this year since 2008. The United
Nations food agency has said global food prices hit a record
high this year.

 SYDNEY/TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Monday
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives lost a key
state election and it could pull back towards $1.39 in the
near-term, with the dollar supported after hawkish comments from
some Fed officials.	
 Failure to break through option barriers around $1.4250 last
week also saw some traders pare long exposure to the common
currency, although support around $1.4015/35 appeared to be
holding for now.	
 ""It's being driven by the positioning in the market. Events
in Portugal and German elections injected a little bit of
uncertainty so the first reaction was to sell the euro,"" said
Robert Reilly, co-head of flow fixed income and currencies at
Societe Generale in Hong Kong. 
 The euro fell 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday to
$1.4051, pulling further away from a 4-1/2 month high of $1.4249
hit last week on trading platform EBS.	
 Earlier on Monday, it was marked down to around $1.4020,
after having triggered stops below $1.4050, with one U.S. bank
cited as the main seller of the euro earlier in the day.	
 The euro has support at the 20-day moving average near
$1.40, and trendline support around $1.3975, which is drawn
through the euro's Jan. 10 low of $1.2860 and March 11 low of
$1.3752.	
 A drop through such support could open the way for further
falls, and traders said one-near term target may be $1.39.	
 The euro had been due for a pull-back, and the dollar due
for a bounce, judging from market positioning.	
 The latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission shows that currency speculators raised the value of
dollar net short positions to $29.82 billion in the week ended
March 22, up from $27.07 billion a week earlier.

yen , pulling away from a record low of 76.25 yen struck
on March 17, when the yen jumped on stop-loss buying by retail

 That jump in the yen prompted joint yen-selling intervention
by Group of Seven industrialised nations the very next day, and
one factor limiting the dollar's downside against the yen now is
wariness that Japanese authorities may intervene further if the
dollar were to drop below 80.00 yen.	
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar was last at $1.0259

 ""The case is a major victory in how China uses the WTO rules
to protect its legal interests, and will greatly increase the
confidence that WTO members have in multilateral rules,"" the
treaty and law representative of China's commerce ministry said
in a statement on the agency's website.	
 ""We hope the United States will ... change its mindset that
China's approach on exports is wrong, maintain a fair trading
environment and the healthy development of Sino-U.S. economic
and trade relations.""	
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said he was disappointed
with the court's verdict, and U.S. lawmakers also criticized the
ruling, which they said would make it more difficult for the
United States to fight the trade-distorting effects of China's
""state capitalism.""	
 The appeals court did not back all the points in China's
appeal, but its 241-page ruling found the United States had
acted unlawfully in some instances. It called on Washington to
bring its practices into line with international trade rules.

 * Volunteer spirit reminiscent of 1995 Kobe disaster

 By Chisa Fujioka	
 HIGASHIMATSUSHIMA, Japan, March 28 (Reuters) - Two weeks
after a tsunami submerged his home in northeast Japan, Naoki
Ishimori is busy not only restoring his own life but helping
others do the same. 
 Often led by survivors, volunteer groups are sprouting in
the area to clear wreckage, salvage supplies and lift battered
spirits in once-vibrant fishing and farming communities that
were flattened by the March 11 quake and tsunami. 
 The disaster killed nearly 11,000 people and left more than
16,000 missing. About a quarter of a million people are
homeless.	
 ""I would get bored if I just stayed in the evacuation centre
all day,"" said Ishimori, 38, a construction site worker in the
Pacific coast town of Higashimatsushima. 
 ""My house was flooded but other houses here are worse off.""
    Ishimori, who lost his job after the tsunami, is part of a
70-strong volunteer group in the town. Members shovel mud out of
homes, dry drenched tatami mats and clear away debris. 
 Such groups have been formed across the region in a sign of
Japan's famed social cohesion and community commitment.	
 The spirit of unity is reminiscent of Japan's last major
quake in the western city of Kobe in 1995, regarded by many as a
precious legacy born out of tragedy.
    In a volunteer movement that united the nation, more than
1.3 million people rushed to Kobe to fill gaps left by a
sluggish government response.
    A similar mass volunteer movement is taking hold after this
disaster, though authorities are for now stemming the influx of
well-wishers from outside.	
 Professional aid groups and disaster experts try to
discourage volunteers from abroad, unless they are trained
emergency responders or have medical or logistics experience in
post-disaster zones. 
 
 ""MY HEART HURTS""	
 ""Right now, this area cannot handle a large number of
volunteers coming in,"" said Yasushi Yokoyama, who was helping
run a volunteer centre at Ofunato City Hall.
    ""There will come a time when we will need a lot of people to
come and help, but now is not that time.""	
 The rebuilding effort will be colossal. Damage could top
$300 billion, making it the world's costliest natural disaster.
    The government has posted a long list of ""do's and don'ts""
for aspiring volunteers on a web site, encouraging people to
book hotels in advance, bring their own food and avoid coming if
they cannot register with a volunteer group on the ground.	
 Authorities are worried about relief efforts becoming
chaotic, especially when the military and police are still
picking through debris looking for bodies. The area is also
suffering from a fuel shortage, limiting transport.
    Many people from outside, though, are eager to help and
those who have already made it to the region say they have been
welcomed.
    ""The biggest challenge was people before we came saying we
should not go. But now that we are, people have been
encouraging,"" said Chad Huddleston, a missionary from the
Japanese church network ""Be One"".    He was delivering food,
blankets, socks and underwear to survivors in Kesennuma, another
town ravaged by the tsunami.
    ""My heart hurts for the people so I just want to help as
much as I can.""

 * Sees investment flows to emerging markets gathering pace
(Adds comments on reserve accumulation, policy meetings)
 By Jason Lange
 CALGARY, Alberta, March 27 (Reuters) - Investment flows
into Mexico and other emerging markets are recovering as
investors digest widespread unrest in the Arab world, Mexico's
finance minister told Reuters in an interview on Sunday.
 ""We had evidence about a slowdown in the arrival of the
flows to emerging markets and in particular to Mexico,"" Finance
Minister Ernesto Cordero said.
 After appreciating sharply in the final three months of
last year, Mexico's peso  has traded in a much tighter
range since unrest exploded in the Arab world during recent
months, including the eruption of civil war in Libya.
 ""But as the news has been analyzed and assimilated, the
flows have picked up some of their pace,"" Cordero said.
 Mountains of cash have flowed into Latin American over the
last year as investors seek higher yields than those offered in
the developed world where central bankers are keeping interest
rates low to help their slow-growing economies. In Mexico,
foreign purchase of debt more than tripled in 2010.
 Investment flows into Mexico and other developing countries
will probably not reverse until the United States and Europe
start to raise interest rates, Cordero said.
 Mexico is increasing its international reserves to deal
with any sudden reversal in investment flows, but Cordero said
he expects the transition will be gradual.
 He said Mexico has no plans to accelerate the accumulation
of dollars. ""We are comfortable with the pace at which we are
building reserves.""
 Cordero also said commodities prices have not been boosting
Mexican inflation.
 ""That is giving us room to maneuver on both monetary and
fiscal policies,"" he said.
 Cordero participates in monetary policy discussions with
the country's central bank policy board but does not have a
vote on interest rate decisions. He said he does voice his
opinion at the meetings regarding where the government thinks
interest rates should be.
 While high commodities prices have been boosting inflation
across Latin America, Cordero said he doesn't think prices for
raw materials will remain high in the long term.

 * Asian shares slip on Japan nuclear concerns

(Fixes word in paragraph 4)	
 By Richard Leong	
 HONG KONG, March 28 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives were
routed in elections in a key state, while Asian shares slipped
as turmoil in the Middle East and Japan's nuclear crisis left
investors with little appetite for riskier assets.	
 ""Clearly risks are rising, but not sufficient to tip the
euro over the edge yet. There's also a range of support on the
way down, it's not going to collapse even if it falls through
$1.40,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 The euro last traded at $1.4046 , compared with
$1.4065 late in New York on Friday. Early in the session, it was
marked down to around $1.4020.	
 Merkel's Christian Democrats lost power on Sunday in the
rich state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where anti-nuclear sentiment
had been mobilised by radiation leaks from an
earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan.	
 The loss of the regional stronghold could limit Merkel's
ability to pass legislation as her coalition centre-right
government deals with nuclear power, military action in Libya
and the euro zone debt crisis. See [ID:nLDE72Q0E6]	
 While erosion of Merkel's clout at home weighed on the euro,
prospects of a European Central Bank rate rise was an important
element holding up the single currency, Gibbs said.	
 Along with its gains versus the euro, the dollar firmed
against the yen , helped by Friday's comments from a U.S.
central bank official who said the Federal Reserve is poised in
the ""not-too-distant future"" to begin rolling back its super
loose monetary policy to avert inflation.	
 Easier U.S. policy has helped boost global financial markets
by flooding them with cheap money in search of higher returns,
though it has also added to inflationary pressures in emerging
economies.	
 The U.S. dollar last traded at 81.58 yen, up from 81.43 late
Friday in New York.	
 Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4 percent as workers continued
to battle to stem radiation leaks at the crippled Fukushima
nuclear plant, and more dead were pulled from the rubble in the
country's northeast, which was devastated by a massive quake and
tsunami on March 11. [ID:nL3E7ER060]	
 Shares elsewhere in Asia were mainly weaker, with MSCI's
index of Asian shares outside Japan easing 0.1
percent.	
 
 
 MIDEAST UNREST SUPPORTS OIL, GOLD	
 Further Western air strikes in Libya and tension in Syria,
Yemen and Bahrain continued to fuel investor uneasiness over
supply from the oil-rich Middle East region and to support safe
haven demand for gold.	
 U.S. crude  was little changed at $105.38 a barrel and
Brent crude  edged up 2 cents to $115.61. 
 Spot gold was last at $1,426.19 an ounce, down
slightly from Friday and below a record high of $1,447.40
reached on March 24. It was still up 2 percent since March 15.

 * JGBs seen vulnerable as govt finances reconstruction
 * Credit Suisse sees 12 trln yen funding shortfall in
FY11/12
 * Watch for bank lending pickup to remove JGB market support

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 25 (Reuters) - The Japanese government bond
market may finally be reaching a tipping point, with the
issuance needs for post-quake reconstruction prompting domestic
investors to demand higher yields to absorb yet more debt.	
 Abroad, Japan's massive and growing debt load has stirred
worries, driving the cost of default insurance to historic peaks
and prompting credit rating cuts to below Spain. At home,
benchmark yields have not budged much from near 1 percent.	
 In a country with public debt twice the size of its $5
trillion economy, many fund managers here are reluctant to talk
on the record about any fears about the bond market -- in part
because they have to justify holding bonds in their super
conservative portfolios. 
 But the direct damage from the March 11 quake and tsunami --
now seen as high as $310 billion, or about 6 percent of the
economy -- is raising some doubts about whether already
overloaded investors can absorb much more debt at such low
yields.	
 Big Japanese banks -- a key pillar of support -- may cut
back on JGB holdings for reconstruction lending, while insurers
may need to sell to raise funds to pay claims. Household
investors have traditionally shifted funds into higher-yielding
foreign assets and prefer JGBs only at yields well above current
levels.	
 ""Yields are not going to rise in the short term but it does
raise medium to long-term risks for the JGB market,"" Hidenori
Suezawa, chief strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.	
 Economists at Credit Suisse said the government may face a
12 trillion yen ($148 billion) funding shortfall in the fiscal
year beginning in April.	
 Even if the Ministry of Finance takes measures to limit the
increase in bond issuance, such as postponing planned corporate
tax cuts, Credit Suisse warned it may not be enough to prevent a
""significant deterioration"" in the JGB market.	
 
 Before the quake and ensuing crisis at a nuclear power
plant, the medium-term risks about bonds were being reflected in
the JGB market via a steep yield curve, with investors gradually
demanding a higher yield to hold long-term bonds relative to
short-term paper.	
 Since the quake, the yield curve between 5-year and 20-year
JGBs has steepened to 158 basis
points and is holding close to last year's decade high of 167
bps. 
 Benchmark 10-year yields even rose slightly
last week as the Nikkei share average plunged more than
10 percent, showing the need among insurers to sell. Yields are
now at 1.220 percent, 40 basis points above seven-year lows
touched last year.	
 Foreign players have gradually built up positions betting on
debt troubles for Japan via credit rating cuts.	
 The five-year credit default spread for JGBs
is now 95 bps, about 15 bps wider than pre-quake levels after
briefly hitting a record above 120 bps last week -- above the
spread of South Korea which has a lower credit rating.	
 Even Takahiro Mitani, chairman of Japan's $1.4 trillion
state pension fund, is aware of the risk. He told Reuters in a
February interview that Japan's debt could reach a ""critical""
point as early as 2016 unless it was tackled.	
 PIMCO warned earlier this year that there was little value
in longer dated JGBs around current yield levels.	
 
 CATALYST FOR RETHINK	
 Mitsubishi UFJ Securities estimates that, in a worst case
scenario, the impact on net government debt outstanding,
compared to where this would otherwise have been, could be as
much as 5-10 percent of GDP by 2014 as a result of the quake.	
 In other words, net government debt could rise to 150
percent of GDP in 2014 from around 130 percent in 2011.	
 ""There is... the possibility of the natural disaster proving
to be the catalyst to an investor rethink about the safety of
JGBs,"" Mitsubishi UFJ said in a note to clients.	
 The quake may also prompt household investors, who still
keep vast sums locked up in deposits yielding almost nothing, to
keep searching for better returns abroad.	
 ""Increased demand for foreign assets from Japan's private
sector and growing revulsion against large portfolio shares for
JGBs means first and foremost a weaker yen,"" it said.	
 In the coming years, rebuilding may help reflate the economy
and end deflation, dealing another blow to JGBs, even if the
fiscal effect can be mitigated by increased tax revenues.	
 One key to watch is the Japanese banks, which have lifted
their holdings of JGBs as a share of total assets to a record
high 18 percent and are one of the biggest regular buyers. A
rebound in lending means banks would inevitably hold fewer JGBs.	
 Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management,
says Japan's effort to grow more via stronger productivity and
lower corporate savings could have an adverse impact.	
 ""An irony of a decline in corporate savings without an
increase in government savings, is that while it might boost
nominal GDP, it might also result in some of the funding fears
that many have expressed for so long as it would make Japan more
vulnerable to foreign sentiment,"" he said.	
 ""In some ways, it seems like a lose-lose situation.""	
 In the very near term, banks and institutions may be tempted
to park their funds in the JGB market following the Bank of
Japan's cash injection that lifted current account deposits at
the central bank to a record above 41 trillion yen. 
 JGB auctions since the quake have drawn decent demand,
including a two-year and a 20-year auctions.	
 JGBs have managed to overcome various risks this year, the
biggest of which being the rating downgrades. Standard & Poor's
for example, now rates Japan one notch lower than Spain.	
 Domestic investors have largely shrugged off the warnings,
but more cuts may be on the way. 
 S&P said last week it was too early to judge the ratings
impact given the scale of the ongoing disaster, with uncertainty
from Japan's nuclear reactors and its future energy supply.	
 ""Given the sheer magnitude of the current disaster, the
rating on Japan could be affected if the debt burden were to
increase materially above our pre-earthquake expectations due to
a significant economic impact and reconstruction costs,"" said
Takahira Ogawa, S&P's Japan credit analyst.

 Globally, half of all respondents favoured the prospect of a

The split was little changed from the previous poll in 2005.
 However, in North America, the majority would view such a

 * Battle to control Fukushima plant seen far from over
 * Japan crisis helps tip Germany poll against Merkel
 * More than 27,000 dead or missing from quake and tsunami
(Adds Kyodo on PM, expert)
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yoko Kubota
 TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - Japan appeared resigned on
Monday to a long fight to contain the world's most dangerous
atomic crisis in 25 years after high radiation levels
complicated work at its crippled nuclear plant.
 Engineers have been battling to control the six-reactor
Fukushima complex since it was damaged by a March 11 earthquake
and tsunami that also left more than 27,000 people dead or
missing across Japan's devastated north east.
 Radiation at the plant has soared in recent days. Latest
readings at the weekend showed contamination 100,000 times
normal in water at reactor No. 2 and 1,850 times normal in the
nearby sea.
 Those were the most alarming levels since the crisis began.
 ""I think maybe the situation is much more serious than we
were led to believe,"" said one expert, Najmedin Meshkati, of the
University of Southern California, adding it may take weeks to
stabilise the situation and the United Nations should step in.
 ""This is far beyond what one nation can handle - it needs to
be bumped up to the U.N. Security Council. In my humble opinion,
this is more important than the Libya no fly zone.""
 Under-pressure plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co.
<9501.T> has conceded it faces a protracted and uncertain
operation to contain overheating fuel rods and avert a meltdown.
 ""Regrettably, we don't have a concrete schedule at the
moment to enable us to say in how many months or years (the
crisis will be over),"" TEPCO vice-president Sakae Muto said in
the latest of round-the-clock briefings the company holds.
Though experts said radiation in the Pacific waters will
quickly dissipate, the levels at the site are clearly dangerous,
and the 450 or so engineers there have won admiration and
sympathy around the world for their bravery and sense of duty.
 The nuclear crisis is an especially sensitive subject for
Japanese given they are the only nation to have been hit by
atomic bombs, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
 Last week, two workers at Fukushima were hurt with radiation
to their legs after water seeped over their shoes, and on Sunday
engineers had to abandon reactor No. 2 after the new reading.
 Further afield, beyond the evacuation zone around Fukushima,
there has been plenty of evidence of radiation -- from tap water
in Tokyo 240 km (150 miles) south of the nuclear facility to
particles found as far away as Iceland.
 Japanese officials and international nuclear experts have
generally said the levels away from the plant are not dangerous
for humans, who anyway face comparable radiation doses on a
daily basis from natural substances, X-rays or plane flights.
 
 ""NOT OVER""
 Two of the plant's six reactors are now seen as safe but the
other four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and smoke.
 TEPCO officials indicated the highly contaminated water is
probably coming from inside the reactors rather than from pools
of spent fuel rods outside.
 Experts are anxious to find out whether the reactor cores
are broken and leaking, as that could lead to a meltdown.
 One long-term solution may be to entomb the Fukushima
reactors in sand and concrete as happened at Chernobyl, Ukraine,
after the 1986 disaster that was the world's worst.
 Yukiya Amano, head of U.N. nuclear watchdog the
International Atomic Energy Agency, said the crisis may drag for
weeks or months. ""This is a very serious accident by all
standards,"" he told the New York Times. ""It is not yet over.""
 The Japan crisis has prompted a reassessment of nuclear
power across the world. It had its most direct political impact
yet in foreign politics in Germany at the weekend.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats lost control
of Germany's most prosperous state, Baden-Wuerttemberg, as
anti-nuclear sentiment benefited her opponents in a regional
vote.
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan has kept a low profile
during the crisis, but may face awkward questions after Kyodo
news agency said his visit to the region the day after the
disaster delayed TEPCO'S response to the unfolding situation.
 ""The process to release the steam was delayed due to the
premier's visit,"" it quoted an unnamed government source as
saying, adding there were fears Kan may be exposed to radiation.
 
 NATIONAL AGONY
 Away from the plant, radioactivity in Japan's air remained
in normal ranges.
 In downtown Tokyo, a Reuters reading on Sunday afternoon
showed ambient radiation of 0.16 microsieverts per hour, below
the global average of naturally occurring background radiation
of 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour.
 The nuclear crisis has compounded Japan's agony after the
magnitude 9.0 quake and massive tsunami devastated its north
east coast, turning whole towns into apocalyptic-looking
landscapes of mud and debris.
 The latest death toll was 10,804 people, with 16,244 still
missing 17 days after the disaster. About a quarter of a million
people are living in shelters.
 Damage could top $300 billion, making it the world's
costliest natural disaster.

 * Her CDU and FDP allies to face criticisms
 * But no alternative to rival on horizon for now
 
 By Stephen Brown and Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, March 27 (Reuters) - Angela Merkel will share the
blame for her Christian Democrats' election rout in the German
conservative heartland on Sunday despite her government's bid to
portray itself as hapless victim of events in Japan and Libya.
 Merkel handed the Greens victory in Baden-Wuerttemberg with
her mishandling of the nuclear issue, likely resulting in the
humiliation of the Greens installing their first state premier
on CDU turf; but it is unlikely to cost the chancellor her job. 
 This is not for lack of criticism of the way Merkel or her
main ally, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle of the Free
Democrats (FDP), have done their job or managed the campaign.
 ""This is a disaster for the CDU and there will be big
discussions in the party,"" said Thorsten Faas, a professor of
politics at Mannheim University in Baden-Wuerttemberg, who sees
a chance Westerwelle might have to quit the FDP leadership.
 Days before the election, when it became crystal clear the
CDU would lose control of a state it has governed since 1953 --
relatively well, going by the strong economy and low crime and
jobless rates -- criticism of Merkel's nuclear and foreign
policy decisions frothed on German newspapers' front pages.
 Eminent conservatives balked at her decision to abstain in a
U.N. vote on military action over Libya and warned against the
dangers of what her former mentor Helmut Kohl said would be an
""overhasty, solitary German exit from nuclear energy"".
 Ex-CDU defence minister Volker Ruehe was quoted on the cover
of the conservative Welt am Sonntag newspaper as saying that
abstaining on Libya was a ""serious mistake of historic
dimensions"". CDU deputy whip Michael Fuchs said the German
public had been perplexed.
 ""Our manoeuvres in the last two weeks simply did not
convince voters,"" said Fuchs.
 
 BAD CRISIS MANAGEMENT
 Bad luck certainly may have contributed to the scale of the
centre-right government's historic defeat.
 ""Events in Japan, war in Libya, the euro debate and many
other things interfered,"" said Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle
of the FDP, which just hung on in Baden-Wuerttemberg but was
ejected from Rhineland-Palatinate's assembly in another vote on
Sunday.
 The day's biggest loser, CDU premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg
Stefan Mappus, said a blend of domestic and external events led
to his defeat, starting with the giant ""Stuttgart 21"" railway
project in the state capital that mobilised Greens-led protest.
 Mappus gave a snapshot of a floundering German conservative
government that recently lost its biggest star -- Karl-Theodor
zu Guttenberg, who quit as defence minister over a plagiarism
case -- and appears increasingly out of touch with the public.
 ""You know what the key words are: Stuttgart 21, energy
consensus, the resignation of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the
terrible events in Japan and many others,"" said Mappus.
 But, however unforseeable the circumstances, Merkel -- who
herself turned the vote into a referendum on her government last
September in a stormy parliament debate on ""Stuttgart 21"" -- has
emerged with her reputation for crisis management in tatters.
 On nuclear energy -- where she first extended the lifespans
of German power plants late last year then, after the Japanese
earthquake, shut down the seven oldest -- Merkel is accused both
of overreacting and of a clumsy and failed campaign ploy.
 But her leadership is not immediately at risk thanks to the
lack of viable alternatives, after the exit of the CDU's most
senior state premiers last year and, more recently, Guttenberg.
 ""She won't have to worry abut a putsch. She doesn't have to
worry about any rivals,"" Gero Neugebauer, a politics professor
at the Free University in Berlin, told Reuters. ""She can think
long-term about how she can stay in power.""
 ""I don't see any consequences for Merkel because there is no
one in the party who could lead a putsch against her at the
moment,"" agreed Gerd Langguth at the University of Bonn.
 Merkel can also count on some voters differentiating between
local and federal politics, like Manuel Blochwitz, a 23-year-old
telecommunications worker in Stuttgart who voted for the Greens
on Sunday because of ""Stuttgart 21"" but is a Merkel fan.
 ""I don't want a change of government before 2013 and I'm

 * Battle to control Fukushima plant seen far from over
 * Japan crisis a factor for German leader's poll trouble
 * More than 27,000 dead or missing from quake and tsunami
 
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yoko Kubota
 TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - Japan appeared resigned on
Monday to a long fight to contain the world's worst atomic
crisis in 25 years after high radiation levels complicated work
at its crippled nuclear plant.
 Engineers have been battling to control the six-reactor
Fukushima complex since it was damaged by a March 11 earthquake
and tsunami that also left more than 27,000 people dead or
missing across Japan's devastated north east.
 Radiation at the plant has soared in recent days: latest
readings at the weekend showed contamination 100,000 times
normal in water at reactor No. 2 and 1,850 times normal in the
nearby sea.
 Those were the most alarming levels since the crisis began,
experts said.
 ""It's very worrying ... there is something seriously wrong
(at No. 2),"" said Rianne Teule, a nuclear expert for
environmental group Greenpeace based in South Africa.
 Under-pressure plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co.
(TEPCO) conceded what experts have long been saying: that Japan
now faces a protracted and uncertain operation to contain
overheating fuel rods and prevent a meltdown.
 ""Regrettably, we don't have a concrete schedule at the
moment to enable us to say in how many months or years (the
crisis will be over),"" TEPCO vice-president Sakae Muto said in
the latest of round-the-clock briefings the company holds.
 Though experts said radiation in the Pacific waters will
quickly dissipate, the levels at the site are clearly dangerous,
and the 450 or so engineers there have won admiration and
sympathy around the world for their bravery and sense of duty.
 The nuclear crisis is an especially sensitive subject for
Japanese given they are the only nation to have been hit by
atomic bombs, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
 Last week, three workers at Fukushima were hurt with
radiation burns to their legs after water seeped over their
boots, and on Sunday engineers had to abandon reactor No. 2
after the new reading.
 Further afield, beyond the evacuation zone around Fukushima,
there has been plenty of evidence of radiation -- from tap water
in Tokyo 240 km (150 miles) south of the nuclear facility to
particles found as far away as Iceland.
 Japanese officials and international nuclear experts have
generally said the levels away from the plant are not dangerous
for humans, who anyway face comparable radiation doses on a
daily basis from natural substances, X-rays or plane flights.
 A clutch of nations including the United States have banned
imports of food from the areas closest to the Fukushima plant.
 
 ""NOT OVER""
 Two of the plant's six reactors are now seen as safe but the
other four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and smoke.
 TEPCO officials indicated the highly contaminated water is
probably coming from inside the reactors rather than from pools
of spent fuel rods outside.
 Experts are anxious to find out whether the reactor core is
broken and leaking, as that could lead to a meltdown.
 One long-term solution may be to entomb the Fukushima
reactors in sand and concrete as happened at Chernobyl, Ukraine,
after the 1986 disaster that was the world's worst. But there is
too much heat for that to be considered yet, experts say.
 Yukiya Amano, head of U.N. nuclear watchdog the
International Atomic Energy Agency, said the crisis may drag for
weeks or months. ""This is a very serious accident by all
standards,"" he told the New York Times. ""It is not yet over.""
 The Japan crisis has prompted a reassessment of nuclear
power across the world. It had its most direct political impact
yet in foreign politics in Germany at the weekend.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats appeared set
to lose control of Germany's most prosperous state,
Baden-Wuerttemberg, with voters punishing the party over a
U-turn on nuclear power after the Japan crisis.
 
 NATIONAL AGONY
 Away from the plant, radioactivity in Japan's air remained
in normal ranges.
 In downtown Tokyo, a Reuters reading on Sunday afternoon
showed ambient radiation of 0.16 microsieverts per hour, below
the global average of naturally occurring background radiation
of 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour.
 The nuclear crisis has compounded Japan's agony after the
magnitude 9.0 quake and massive tsunami devastated its north
east coast, turning whole towns into apocalyptic-looking
landscapes of mud and debris.
 The latest death toll was 10,804 people, with 16,244 still
missing 17 days after the disasters struck.
 About a quarter of a million people are living in shelters.
 Damage could top $300 billion, making it the world's
costliest natural disaster. Though the disaster will affect
Japan's economic growth in the short-term, analysts say that
will be quickly compensated by the stimulus of reconstruction.
 Facing undoubtedly their most testing moment since World War
II, Japanese have reacted with remarkable resilience and unity.
 Aid has poured into the disaster zone, refugees have
organised themselves meticulously in evacuation centres, and
rescuers have not given up the painful but methodical search for
bodies and momentos like photographs among the wreckage.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2011 01:12PM ET</span>",UPDATE 4-Merkel's party loses power in rich German state," * Merkel looks set to lose conservative stronghold
 * Greens and Social Democrats gain on nuclear debate
(Updates with new results, quotes)
 By Christiaan Hetzner
 STUTTGART, Germany, March 27 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela
Merkel's conservatives lost power in a regional stronghold on
Sunday, with early poll results showing the Greens, buoyed by
Japan's nuclear crisis, surging to their first state
premiership.
 In Baden-Wuerttemberg state, where anti-nuclear sentiment
has been mobilised by Japan's nuclear breakdown, the Greens and
Social Democrats (SPD) were set to win 47.3 percent, eclipsing
the Christian Democrats who held power there for six decades.
 Merkel's CDU and their Free Democrat coalition partners, big
backers of nuclear power, won a combined 44.3 percent, according
to projections at 1800 GMT in the state of 11 million people.
 Analysts said the loss would cause Merkel some headaches in
her party, with many disconcerted by recent policy decisions;
but they thought an immediate leadership challenge was unlikely.
 ""The horrible pictures from Japan and the horrible events in
Japan was the main issue over the last two weeks,"" said defeated
CDU state premier Stefan Mappus. ""There was no other campaign
topic and the winds from Berlin were also blowing against us.""
 The CDU, which has governed the state for 58 years, took 39.3
percent and the FDP 5. The Greens finished second with 24.2
percent and the SPD, their likely allies, took 23.2 percent.
 ""This is a historic victory,"" said Winfired Kretschmann, 62,
the Greens leader in the state. ""We will change things.""
 The Greens' 13 percent advance was mirrored in another state
election on Sunday in Rhineland-Palatinate, where the SPD held
onto power and was likely to form a coaltion with the Greens.
 SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel called the vote a clear
rejection of nuclear power: ""This was a referendum against
nuclear power and the people decided they don't want it.""

 FOREIGN EVENTS BLAMED
 Economy Minister Rainer Bruedele from the FDP called his
party's ejection from Rhineland-Palatinate's assembly a bitter
defeat and blamed ""events in Japan, war in Libya and the euro
debate"".
 Last month Merkel's conservatives were ousted in Hamburg in
a state election and lost control of North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany's most populous state, last May.
 She has already lost her majority in the upper house of
parliament, or Bundesrat, where the 16 states are represented,
and further gains for the opposition mean her ability to pass
some legislation will be severely limited.
 Merkel's policy U-turns on nuclear power, military action in
Libya and the euro zone debt crisis turned the closely-watched
Baden-Wuerttenberg contest into a virtual referendum on the
performance of her 1 1/2-year-old centre-right government.
 She abruptly shut down seven of Germany's 17 nuclear plants
right after the disaster in Japan and put on ice plans to extend
the use of atomic energy by 12 years from 2022 -- moves that
voters and analysts described as a campaign ploy.
 ""I hope that the anti-nuclear movement will be strengthened
across Europe with this election result,"" said Renate Stephan,
65, an accountant. ""That was the main issue.""
 ""This is the beginning of the end for Merkel,"" said Lienhard
Bauer, a 53-year-old banker in Stuttgart. ""I've been a CDU party
member for more than 30 years but I didn't vote CDU this time.""
 Merkel could face some turbulence. After her SPD predecessor
as chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, lost North Rhine-Westphalia in
2005, he called a snap election and lost. But analysts believe
she will quickly be able to steady her reeling party.
 Anti-nuclear sentiment and criticism of Merkel's confused
stance were big issues in a state where environmentalists were
already mobilised by opposition to a major infrastructure
programme in the state capital, a railway project in Stuttgart.

 In Baden-Wuerttemberg state, the Greens and Social Democrats
(SPD) looked set to win a combined 48.5 percent in an election
on Sunday where Japan's nuclear disaster played a major role.
The centre-left has long pushed to end the use of nuclear power.

 By Christiaan Hetzner
 STUTTGART, Germany, March 27 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela
Merkel's Christian Democrats face election defeat on Sunday in
one of Germany's most prosperous states, an outcome that could
undermine her leadership of the centre-right government.
 The Social Democrats (SPD) and their likely allies, the
fast-growing Greens, gained the edge over Merkel's coalition of
Christian Democrats (CDU) and Free Democrats (FDP) in opinion
polls before the vote in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
 In another vote in neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate, the
SPD was expected to retain power with the Greens' support.
 Voter turnout on a warm and mild early spring day in both
states was higher than four years ago, election officials said.
 The CDU, which has governed Baden-Wuerttemberg without
interruption since 1953, has been hurt by Merkel's policy
U-turns on nuclear power, Libya and the euro zone debt crisis.
 ""Our chances to win were never better,"" said SPD candidate
Nils Schmid after casting his ballot in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
 The race has turned into a referendum on Merkel.
 ""She no longer looks like a strong leader for her party who
can get the job done,"" Gero Neugebauer, political scientist at
Berlin's Free University, told Reuters.
 Baden-Wuerttemberg, on the French and Swiss borders is known
for its car industry, medieval university towns and the Black
Forest. Losing it would weaken Merkel's grip on her party, which
suffered a bitter state election defeat in Hamburg last month.
 It would be ironic as Baden-Wuerttemberg is one of Germany's
richest states with its lowest unemployment rate -- 4.7 percent.
 CDU state premier Stefan Mappus warned of disorder in the
southwestern state if the conservatives lose control.
 ""What's at stake is the future of Baden-Wuerttemberg ...
We've got the lowest unemployment and highest wages in Germany,""
Mappus told Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ""There would be chaos if
the SPD and Greens win.""
 
 MERKEL'S FUTURE
 Merkel's future could be clouded if the CDU loses. After her
SPD predecessor as chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, lost North
Rhine-Westphalia in 2005, he called a snap election and lost.
 ""Merkel's standing in the party would be badly shaken if the
CDU lose Baden-Wuerttemberg,"" Juergen Falter, political
scientist at Mainz University, told Bild am Sonntag. ""There will
be massive criticism in the party about her leadership.""
 Anti-nuclear sentiment and criticism of Merkel's confused
stance have become big issues in a state where environmentalists
were already mobilised by opposition to a major infrastructure
programme in the state capital, a railway project in Stuttgart.
 After extending the life-spans of Germany's 17 nuclear power
plants late last year, Merkel's government shut down seven
plants immediately after Japan's nuclear emergency broke out.
 About 200,000 people demonstrated across Germany on Saturday
calling for all nuclear plants to be shut.
 The ARD TV network predicted a high voter turnout in
Baden-Wuerttemberg as surveys showed interest in the election
surging after the Japanese disaster. Turnout fell to a post-war
low of 53.4 percent in 2006 but may now hit 70 percent, it said.
 Late polls showed the SPD and Greens leading the CDU and FDP
by 48 to 43 percent, with a high proportion of undecided voters
-- as much as 40 percent -- seen boosting the Greens, who could
even secure a German state premiership for the first time.
 ""If people vote under the influence of the nuclear debate,
that pushes them towards the Greens, especially if they're not
clearly predisposed to any party,"" said Thorsten Faas, professor
of politics at Mannheim University in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
 The euro zone crisis has not figured high in the campaign,
despite Merkel's efforts to be seen as a defender of the German
taxpayer by seeking strict conditions for bailouts. She has been
criticised for ceding too much ground in the euro crisis.
 Merkel has been chided in some media for isolating Germany
within NATO by abstaining in a U.N. Security Council vote on
military action over Libya. But a poll for Focus magazine
suggested 56 percent supported her position.

be seen here: http://link.reuters.com/xyd78r
 By Brian Winter
 SAO PAULO, March 27 (Reuters) - Construction projects
related to Brazil's World Cup, already well behind schedule,
have run into another unexpected problem -- financing.
 Of the $14 billion that Brazil plans to spend on airports
and other projects directly related to the Cup, more than 98.5
percent of the funds will likely come from public-sector
sources, according to a report by the Tribunal de Contas da
Uniao, the official accountability arm of the Brazilian
government.
 That wasn't always the plan. Ricardo Teixeira, the head of
the official host committee, said as recently as 2009 that a
majority of the funds should come from the private sector,
according to media reports at the time.
 Other infrastructure projects not related to the World Cup
have fared better, especially in the booming oil and gas
sector. However, in riskier areas such as airports, seaports
and railroads, some say the Brazilian government has yet to
create guarantees and make regulatory changes that would
attract more private capital.
 ""In some areas, concrete opportunities just haven't been
structured for the private sector to invest,"" said Jean-Marc
Etlin, executive vice president at Itau BBA, a Brazilian
investment bank.
 In Brasilia, officials say they are likely to continue to
depend heavily on financing from the state-run BNDES
development bank and other public-sector sources to build dams,
highways and other big-ticket projects.
 ""We just don't see the conditions for a greater
participation of the private sector at this time,"" said
Mauricio Muniz, a Planning Ministry official overseeing
infrastructure projects.
 The big barrier, from the private sector's perspective:
BNDES is able to offer subsidized long-term loans at far lower
interest rates than Brazilian banks. The benchmark lending rate
in Brazil is 11.75 percent, one of the world's highest among
major countries, and is likely to rise further this year.
 Meanwhile, long-term financing is still a relatively new
concept in a country where inflation was running at 2,500
percent fewer than two decades ago. BNDES President Luciano
Coutinho has called the bank Brazil's ""only long-term lender.""
 The BNDES's rapid expansion has stirred some concerns. It
loaned more than $96 billion in 2010, three times more than the
World Bank. Some economists say the rapid credit growth helped
push inflation to a six-year high last year.
 Coutinho himself has spoken of the need to scale down the
BNDES's operations over time to allow private banks more room.
Yet the bank's delinquency rate is an extremely low 0.15
percent, and many of its private-sector counterparts praise its
lending standards and overall credit-worthiness.
 ""Their monitoring of projects is extremely well done,"" said
Cassio Schmitt, who works on project finance for Banco
Santander  in Sao Paulo. He said the BNDES should
eventually finance a smaller percentage of projects in Brazil,
""but that reduction needs to be done very gradually.""

 By Shinichi Saoshiro and Taiga Uranaka	
 TOKYO, March 27 (Reuters) - Workers were withdrawn from a
reactor building at Japan's earthquake-wrecked nuclear plant on
Sunday after potentially lethal levels of radiation were
detected in water there, a major setback for the effort to avert
a catastrophic meltdown.	
 The operator of the facility said radiation in the water of
the No. 2 reactor was measured at more than 1,000 millisieverts
an hour, the highest reading so far in a crisis triggered by a
massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11.	
 That compares with a national safety standard of 250
millisieverts over a year. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency says a single dose of 1,000 millisieverts is enough to
cause haemorrhaging. [ID:nL3E7ER02S]	
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. later said
the extremely high radioactivity readings might have been wrong,
adding the levels were being re-checked. 
 ""The situation is serious. They have to pump away this water
on the floor, get rid of it to lower the radiation,"" said Robert
Finck, radiation protection specialist at the Swedish Radiation
Safety Authority, speaking before the operator expressed doubt
about the high reading.	
 ""It's virtually impossible to work, you can only be there
for a few minutes. It's impossible to say how long it will take
before they can gradually take control."" 	
 The Japanese government said the overall situation was
unchanged at the plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.
Two of the plant's six reactors are now seen as safe but the
other four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and smoke. 
 ""We did expect to run into unforeseen difficulties, and this
accumulation of high radioactivity water is one such example,""
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told a news briefing.	


 Yukiya Amano, director-general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, said the emergency could go on for weeks, if not
months. ""This is a very serious accident by all standards,"" he
told the New York Times. ""And it is not yet over."" 
 At Chernobyl in Ukraine a quarter of a century ago, the
worst nuclear accident in the world, it took weeks to stabilise
what remained of the reactor that exploded and months to clean
up radioactive materials and cover the site with a concrete and
steel sarcophagus.	
 Experts say there is still too much heat in the reactor
cores and spent fuel at the Fukushima plant for a similar
last-ditch solution to be considered yet. 
 Hundreds of Tokyo Electric Power Co. engineers have been
working around the clock to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi
plant since the earthquake and tsunami knocked out the back-up
power system needed to cool the reactors. 
 The operation has been suspended several times due to
explosions and spiking radiation levels inside the reactors.	
 Last Thursday, three workers were taken to hospital from
reactor No. 3 after stepping in water with radiation levels
10,000 times higher than usually found in a reactor. 
 
 LEVELS 10 MILLION TIMES ABOVE NORMAL	
 The latest scare came as engineers were trying to pump
radioactive water out of a turbine unit after it was found in
buildings housing three of the reactors. 
 Officials at first said the water in No. 2 was found to
contain 10 million times the amount of radioactive iodine that
is normal in the reactor, but noted the substance had a
half-life of under an hour, meaning it would disappear within a
day. 
 Later they said the element that gave the reading may have
been cobalt 56, which has a half life of 77 days, and if this
was the case the level of radioactivity would have been far
lower. 
 Radiation levels in the sea off the plant rose on Sunday to
1,850 times normal, from 1,250 on Saturday, Japan's Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency said.	
 ""Ocean currents will disperse radiation particles and so it
will be very diluted by the time it gets consumed by fish and
seaweed,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a senior agency official.	
 
 TOKYO RADIATION LEVELS NORMAL	
 The elevated radiation detected on Sunday was confined to
the reactor, and radioactivity in the air beyond the evacuation
zone around the plant remained in normal ranges.	
 In downtown Tokyo, a Reuters reading on Sunday afternoon
showed ambient radiation of 0.16 microsieverts per hour, below
the global average of naturally occurring background radiation
of 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour. 
 Several countries have banned produce and milk from Japan's
nuclear crisis zone and are monitoring Japanese seafood because
of fears of radioactive contamination.	
 Kyodo news agency said Japan would call on World Trade
Organisation members at a meeting this week not to overreact to
the radiation scare and abide by rules that ban import
restrictions not based on scientific grounds. 
 The accident has also triggered concern around the globe
about the safety of nuclear power generation. U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was time to reassess the
international atomic safety regime. [ID:nN25258777] 
 The crisis looked set to claim its first, and unlikely,
political casualty. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's party
faced defeat in a key state on Sunday, largely because of her
U-turn on nuclear power.[ID:nLDE72O1HM] 
 
 OVERSHADOWING RELIEF EFFORT	
 The drama at the plant has overshadowed a relief and
recovery effort from the magnitude 9.0 quake and the huge
tsunami it triggered that left more than 27,100 people dead or
missing in northeast Japan.	
 In Otsu, 70 km (42 miles) south of the stricken nuclear
facility, the townsfolk are faced with livelihoods derailed by
the natural disaster and now the fear of radiation in the air. 
 Ninety-three-year-old Kou Murata sat cross-legged on the
floor of a school classroom, her home for the past fortnight.
Surrounded by piles of quilts and blankets, she fretted over
what was to become of her in the twilight of her life. 
 ""I am afraid because people are leaving, and we are alone,""
she said, looking small and frail in a jacket decorated with
snowmen.	
 Murata's daughter, Hisae, said the government had not helped
them. 
 ""I want to go back home, but the situation is impossible,""
she said. ""I applied to the government to get a temporary house,
but we need a certificate to say the house was destroyed. Now
all the temporary houses have been taken. We thought the
government would come to us, but we need to go to them.""	
 The first opinion poll to be taken since the disaster showed
the approval rating for Prime Minister Naoto Kan had edged
higher, to 28.3 percent, but more than half disapproved of how
the nuclear crisis had been handled. [ID:nL3E7ER03E]	
 Prior to the earthquake, Kan's approval rating had sunk to
around 20 percent, opposition parties were blocking budget bills
to force a snap election that his party was at risk of losing
and critics inside his own camp were pressing him to quit. 
 The government estimated last week the material damage from
the catastrophe could top $300 billion, making it the world's
costliest natural disaster.

10,000 times higher than usually found in a reactor. 
 
 LEVELS 10 MILLION TIMES ABOVE NORMAL	
 The latest radiation scare was confined to inside the
reactor. Radiation levels in the air beyond the evacuation zone
around the plant and in Tokyo have been in normal ranges.	
 Officials said the water in No. 2 contained 10 million times
the amount of radioactive iodine than is normal in the reactor,
but noted the substance had a half-life of less than an hour,
meaning it would disappear within a day. 
 The engineers evacuated from the reactor's turbine housing
unit had been trying to pump radioactive water out of the power
station after it was found in buildings housing three of the six
reactors.	
 Radiation levels in the sea off the plant rose on Sunday to
1,850 times normal just over two weeks after the disaster
struck, from 1,250 on Saturday, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial
Safety Agency said.	
 ""Ocean currents will disperse radiation particles and so it
will be very diluted by the time it gets consumed by fish and
seaweed,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a senior agency official.	
 In downtown Tokyo, a Reuters reading on Sunday afternoon
showed ambient radiation of 0.16 microsieverts per hour, below
the global average of naturally occurring background radiation
of 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour, a range given by the World
Nuclear Association. 
 Several countries have banned produce and milk from Japan's
nuclear crisis zone and are monitoring Japanese seafood over
fears of radioactive contamination.	
 The accident has also triggered concern around the globe
about the safety of nuclear power generation. U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was time to reassess the
international atomic safety regime. 
 The crisis also looks set to claim its first, and unlikely,
political casualty. In far away Germany, Chancellor Angela
Merkel's party faces a defeat in a key state on Sunday, largely
because of her policy U-turns on nuclear power. 
 
 OVERSHADOWING RELIEF EFFORT	
 The drama at the plant has overshadowed a relief and
recovery effort from the magnitude 9.0 quake and the huge
tsunami it triggered that left more than 27,100 people dead or
missing in northeast Japan.	
 The first opinion poll to be taken since the disaster struck
showed that approval ratings for Japanese Prime Minister Naoto
Kan had edged higher, to 28.3 percent, but more than half
disapproved of how the nuclear crisis had been
handled. 
 Prior to the earthquake, Kan's approval rating had sunk to
around 20 percent, opposition parties were blocking budget bills
to force a snap election that his party was at risk of losing,
and critics inside his own camp were pressing him to quit. 
 The survey published by Kyodo news agency on Sunday showed
that nearly two-thirds of respondents were in favour of a tax
increase to help fund recovery in the earthquake-torn northeast.	
 The government estimated last week the material damage from
the catastrophe could top $300 billion, making it the world's
costliest natural disaster. 
 In addition, power cuts have disrupted production while the
drawn-out battle to prevent a meltdown at the 40-year-old plant
has hurt consumer confidence and spread contamination fears well
beyond Japan. 
 Amano, a former Japanese diplomat who made a trip to Japan
after the quake, said authorities were still unsure about
whether the plant's reactor cores and spent fuel were covered
with the water needed to cool them.	
 He said he saw a few ""positive signs"" with the restoration
of some electric power to the plant, but added: ""More efforts
should be done to put an end to the accident."" 
 A Tokyo Electric official told a news conference on Saturday
that experts were mulling where to put the contaminated water
that plant workers have been trying to pump out of the reactors.	
 They also are not sure where the radiation is leaking from
-- whether it's from the spent-fuel rod pools or elsewhere in
the reactors.	
 Two of the six reactors are now seen as safe but the other
four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and smoke.

 At Chernobyl in Ukraine, the worst nuclear accident in the
world, it took weeks to ""stabilise"" what remained of the reactor
that exploded and months to clean up radioactive materials and
cover the site with a concrete and steel sarcophagus.

"
1383,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2011 04:28AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-How much radiation is dangerous?," TOKYO, March 27 (Reuters) - Radiation levels remained a huge
worry in Japan on Sunday following a spike in radioactivity
in water at the Fukushima nuclear power facility. 
 But there has been no indication that people beyond the
plant's immediate vicinity have been exposed to harmful doses.	
 Operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said radiation
levels were over 1,000 millisieverts per hour at Reactor No. 2
and evacuated workers from the turbine building there.
Japan's nuclear safety agency has said that as emergency
workers, they are allowed to be exposed to 250 millisieverts per
year. 
 Experts say the rise in radioactivity in the water at
the reactor does not pose much danger to those outside as long
as it is contained safely. 
 ""It depends on where this water's going and what
they're doing with it,"" said Murray Jennex, professor at San
Diego State University. ""If it's allowed to run off into the
ground and stuff, you're getting a concentration in the ground.
If it's going into the ocean, you're getting some accumulation
in the ocean."" 


 
 Here are some facts about radiation and the health
dangers it poses: 
 * Radiation is measured using the unit sievert, which
quantifies the amount absorbed by human tissues. One sievert is
1,000 millisieverts and 1 million microsieverts. 
 * People are constantly exposed to some level of natural
radiation. They also get exposed to tiny amounts through sitting
in airplanes, routine chest or dental x-rays, and larger amounts
through medical tests such as CT-scans and MRIs. A single-organ
CT scan, for example, gives a radiation dose of about 6,900
microsieverts.	
 * On Sunday afternoon, radiation levels in central Tokyo
were around 0.16 microsieverts per hour. That is a level experts
describe as minimal, and just below the global average of
naturally occurring background radiation of 0.17-0.39 per hour,
a range given by the World Nuclear Association. It is also
significantly lower than the cosmic radiation of up to 7
microsieverts per hour experienced on a Tokyo-New York flight.

 Below are different levels of massive radiation exposure in
a single dose -- all measured in millisieverts -- and their
likely effects on humans, as published by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency:	
 - 50-100: changes in blood chemistry 
 - 500: nausea, within hours	
 - 700: vomiting 
 - 750: hair loss, within 2-3 weeks 
 - 900: diarrhoea 
 - 1,000: haemorrhage 
 - 4,000: possible death within 2 months, if no treatment 
 - 10,000: destruction of intestinal lining, internal
bleeding and death within 1-2 weeks 
 - 20,000: damage to the central nervous system and loss of
consciousness within minutes, and death within hours or days

 * IMF warns about Latam inflation, credit bubbles
 By Jason Lange and Louise Egan
 CALGARY, Alberta, March 26 (Reuters) - Canada says the
current commodities boom could last decades and warned
developing countries against being too timid with interest rate
hikes, while the International Monetary Fund said that much of
the Latin American economy is overheating.
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney told policymakers from
North and South America on Saturday that they should not count
on commodities prices coming down any time soon, a position
likely to be much discussed at this weekend's meeting of
Western Hemisphere finance officials in snowy Calgary.
 ""It's a mistake to chalk this all up to cyclical
(factors),"" Carney said, referring to the argument that prices
for goods such as copper and grains have risen only because of
an upswing in the global business cycle.
 ""We're in an environment that is probably going to be with
us for several decades,"" he said during a panel discussion at
the Inter-American Development Bank's annual meeting.
 Across Latin America, inflation is accelerating on both
strong consumer demand and because a soaring commodities market
has pushed food prices higher.
 Indeed, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned
that many Latin American economies, which have rebounded from
the global financial crisis with help from strong demand for
their commodities exports, are now growing too quickly.
 ""In many of them there are worrisome signs of overheating,""
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in a blog,
adding that growth in the region's financial markets put Latin
America at greater risk of credit bubbles.
 Strauss-Kahn said he discussed the region's policy
challenges earlier in the day in Calgary with Western
Hemisphere finance ministers, who held meetings in parallel
with the IDB meeting.
 Some Latin American policymakers have argued that the
food-price boom will pass and that focus should be put on
whether the temporary price shock will poison inflation
expectations.
 But Carney said in a speech on Saturday that the outlook
for underlying demand is strong because of the rapid
development of emerging markets.
 He warned that misguided policies in emerging markets for
dealing with high inflation and a flood of capital could lead
to financial instability and weak global economic growth.
 ""That's where one can make pretty big mistakes and delay
too much, both on the monetary side, or on the pretty
fundamental structural reforms,"" he said.
 As the world recovers from recession, nations have clashed
over foreign exchange policy as many countries adjust to
ultra-low U.S. interest rates and China's reluctance to let the
yuan appreciate more freely. Investors seeking high yields have
put their money into Latin America, exacerbating these
tensions.
 Referring to what Brazil's finance minister dubbed the
""currency wars,"" Carney said that when large economies keep
their currencies from appreciating, others feel pressured to
follow suit. This leads to a chain reaction of other
distortional policies.
 ""The collective impact of this behavior risks inflation and
asset bubbles in emerging economies and, over time, subpar
global growth,"" he said.
 THIS BOOM IS DIFFERENT
 Carney sees the current high commodity prices persisting
for much longer than in past boom cycles because of the rapid
urbanization and mushrooming middle classes in emerging
economies such as China and India.
 ""Even though history teaches that all booms are finite,
this one could go on for some time,"" he said.
 The other thing that is different about this commodity boom
-- and which could lead to dangerous global imbalances -- is
that the strong demand from emerging markets is combined with
tepid growth in core advanced economies such as the United
States.
 This shift to a ""multipolar economy"" is permanent and
should not be underestimated, Carney said.
 ""Some countries are postponing monetary tightening in the
hope that old relationships reassert."" Others have introduced
measures to curb capital inflows. ""All appear to be
underestimating the scale of what is happening. Therein lies
the risk of another crisis,"" he said.

 TOKYO, March 27 (Reuters) - Japanese authorities evacuated
workers on Sunday from a reactor building they were working in
after radiation in water at the crippled nuclear power plant
reached potentially lethal levels, the plant's operator said. 
 Tokyo Electric Power Co said radiation in the water
of the No. 2 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi plant was measured
at more than 1,000 millisieverts an hour. That compares with a
national safety standard of 250 millisieverts over a year. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says a dose of 1,000
millisieverts is enough to cause haemorrhaging.	
 Japanese nuclear regulators said the water contained 10
million times the amount of radioactive iodine than is normal in
the reactor, but noted the substance had a half life of less
than an hour, meaning it would disappear within a day. 
 A Tokyo Electric official said workers were evacuated from
the No. 2 reactor's turbine housing unit to prevent them from
being exposed to harmful doses of radiation. They had been
trying to pump radioactive water out of the power station after
it was found in buildings housing three of the six reactors.	


 Tokyo Electric engineers have struggled the past two weeks
to prevent a catastrophic meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi, after
an unprecedented earthquake and tsunami knocked out the backup
power system needed to cool the reactors. 
 The work has had to be suspended several times due to
explosions and spiking radiation levels inside the reactors, in
a crisis that has become the worst nuclear emergency since
Chernobyl a quarter-century ago.	
 On Thursday, three workers were taken to hospital from
reactor No. 3 after stepping in water with radiation levels
10,000 times higher than usually found in a reactor.	
 The latest radiation scare was confined to inside the
reactor. Radiation levels in the air beyond the evacuation zone
around the plant and in Tokyo have been in normal ranges.	
 Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), cautioned that the nuclear
emergency could go on for weeks, if not months more. 
 ""This is a very serious accident by all standards,"" he told
the New York Times. ""And it is not yet over.""	
 Radiation levels in the sea off the Fukushima Daiichi plant
rose on Sunday to 1,850 times normal just over two weeks after

 NOT WORSENING

contaminated water they're trying to pump out of the reactors.	
 They also are not sure where the radiation is leaking from
-- whether its from the spent fuel rod pools or elsewhere in the

 ""That's the problem they have right now, is trying to figure
out where this comes from,"" said Murray Jennex, associate
professor at San Diego State University. 
 ""You let (radioactive)stuff accumulate because you don't
have a place to put it. It stays down in the bottom of the
plant. If nothing happens, when it comes time to shut it down
you clean it up and take care of it. But if something like this
happens, that stuff now becomes loose sometimes.""	
 Two of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors are now seen as safe
but the other four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and
smoke. 
 ""We are preventing the situation from worsening,"" Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told a news conference on
Saturday. ""We've restored power and pumped in fresh water, and

 By Louise Egan and Jason Lange
 CALGARY, Alberta, March 26 (Reuters) - Canada's top central
banker said on Saturday the commodity price boom could last for
decades and urged his emerging market peers facing inflationary
pressures not to delay raising interest rates for too long.
 The rise in prices for commodities is partly due to supply
effects, though underlying demand remains strong, Bank of
Canada Governor Mark Carney said during a panel discussion at
the Inter-American Development Bank's annual meeting in
Calgary.
 ""It's a mistake to chalk this all up to cyclical, and
that's where one can make pretty big mistakes and delay too
much, both on the monetary side, or on the pretty fundamental
structural reforms,"" Carney said.
 ""... We're in an environment that is probably going to be
with us for several decades,"" he said.
 One challenge for Canada, a major producer of oil, gas,
grains and metals, is to rebalance trade and investment away
from its top buyer, the United States, he added.
 In a speech earlier on Saturday, Carney warned that
misguided policies for dealing with high inflation and a flood
of capital into emerging markets could lead to financial
instability and weak economic growth.
 ""The stakes are very high,"" he said.
 Carney said some countries were postponing interest rate
hikes, needed to arrest inflation, for fear of further boosting
currencies that have already been pushed higher due to heavy
capital inflows.
 As the world recovers from recession, nations have clashed
over foreign exchange policy as many countries adjust to
ultra-low U.S. interest rates and China's reluctance to let the
yuan appreciate more freely. Investors seeking high yields have
put their money into Latin America, exacerbating these

the risk of another crisis,"" he said.
 Carney said Latin America is the region most affected by
these pressures. However, he too has grappled with a sharp
currency appreciation in Canada, which has hampered the
country's recovery and allowed the Bank of Canada to keep
benchmark interest rates on hold since last September. Foreign
investors also bought a record amount in Canadian securities
last year.
 In terms of measures that can be taken in the short term to
contain these pressures, Carney proposed a renewed commitment
among G7 countries for floating exchange rates and a global
code of conduct on capital flows.

 CALGARY, Alberta, March 26 (Reuters) - Latin American
economic growth will slow this year to 4.5 percent from 6.1
percent last year as countries raise interest rates and rein in
spending to curb inflation, a global banking group predicted on
Saturday.
 The Institute of International Finance's outlook on the
region noted that inflationary pressures and sharp currency
appreciation are the main challenges facing policymakers as
they consider how quickly to put the brakes on the economy.
 ""The strong performance of these economies and the search
for yield by international investors are combining to challenge
the skills of governments and central banks in the region,""
Rick Waugh, IIF vice chairman and chief executive of Bank of
Nova Scotia, said in a statement.
 ""We believe that most governments and central banks will
take the necessary fiscal steps and pursue appropriate exchange
rate policies,"" he said on the sidelines of the annual meeting
of the Inter-American Development Bank.
 Central banks have delayed rate hikes for fear of fueling
further currency appreciation, despite inflationary pressures
caused by emergency low rates in the United States, rising food
prices and robust growth, the report said.
 Growth will come in at about 4.6 percent in 2012, it said.

 Investors will continue to flood Latin America with capital
over the next two years as they favor high-yielding assets, the
group believes. It estimates private inflows of about $215
billion in each of the next two years.
 Waugh said new global banking regulations aimed at avoiding
future crises by forcing banks to hold higher capital and
liquidity levels would be ""suffocating"" for Canadian and Latin
American banks that did not fail during the global crisis.
 He urged Latin American authorities to ""adapt new global
banking regulatory requirements with great care"" to ensure they
do not stifle growth.

 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, March 25 (Reuters) - China said on Friday it
complied with ""most measures at issue"" in an international
trade ruling made against its restrictions on
copyright-intensive goods such as films, books and music.
 But the United States, which filed the case against China
years ago, took a dimmer view of Beijing's action to date and
said the two sides had begun discussions of how to proceed if
Washington decides to pursue a request to impose sanctions.
 China's statement made in Geneva at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) headquarters came six days after a deadline
to comply with the WTO ruling elapsed.
 The United States says China's restrictions on goods such
as books, newspapers, films, DVDs and music create demand for
pirated goods. China lost a WTO appellate body ruling in
December 2009 and agreed with the United States that it would
implement the decision by March 19, 2011.
 China said the dispute was ""embodied with more complexity
and sensitivity than other disputes.""
 ""China made tremendous efforts to implement the DSB's
rulings and recommendations and so far has completed amendments
to most measures at issue,"" it said, referring to the WTO's
dispute settlement body.
 But the United States said China still had a ways to go to
comply with the ruling.
 ""The United States is troubled by the lack of any apparent
progress by China in bringing its measures relating to films
for theatrical release into compliance with the DSB (dispute
settlement body) recommendations and rulings,"" the United
States said in its statement.
 ""The United States also has significant concerns about the
incomplete progress relative to China's measures relating to
audio visual home entertainment products, reading materials and
sound recordings,"" it added.
 U.S. officials informed the WTO membership that it has
begun discussions with China on the possibility of the United
States requesting WTO permission to impose sanctions in the
dispute, known in WTO jargon as ""suspending concessions.""
 ""The United States and China are in discussions regarding
how to handle any eventual request for a compliance proceeding
... and any eventual request for authorization to suspend
concessions,"" the United States said.
 ""The United States hopes to report progress in those
discussions in the coming days,"" it said.

 NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - Global stocks posted their

 Helped by a rise in tech shares after an upbeat outlook

bond-buying stimulus program beyond a planned $600 billion.
 Philadelphia Fed Bank President Charles Plosser also said
the Fed will have to reverse its easy money policy in the
""not-too-distant future"" to avoid sowing the seeds of
inflation, changing the outlook for interest rates. Plosser is
a voting member of the Fed's policy committee.

 NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar climbed
against the euro on Friday and is likely to remain buoyant in
the week ahead after a Federal Reserve official said the
central bank will have to tighten monetary policy soon to avoid
sowing the seeds of inflation.
 Speaking in New York, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank
President Charles Plosser said consumer spending continues to
expand at a ""reasonably robust pace"" and the labor market is
improving. The overall economy, he said, has gained
""significant strength and momentum"" since the summer. For
details, see [ID:nLDE72O1T3]
 U.S. non-farm payrolls data for March will be released on
Friday. The report will be more closely watched than usual for
a clue as to when U.S. interests rates may rise.
 ""Strong payrolls data next week would give hawks within the
Fed more ammunition and could raise the risk of an adjustment
to the bank's official statement following its next policy
meeting,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""Such a scenario
would add significantly to the dollar's relative yield appeal.""
 The euro  was last down 0.8 percent at $1.4067,
having hit a session low of $1.4055 on trading platform EBS.
 The euro is also being pressured in the short run on
concern about a worsening debt crisis in Portugal following the
collapse of the government.
 But investors also say that while a pullback in the single
currency is likely, the euro should be supported as long as it
holds above $1.40. Expectations of a euro-zone interest rate
rise next month have helped its resilience.
 ""For most of the week the market has treated Portugal as an
isolated problem that will not spread to other parts of Europe,
but this sentiment is losing popularity very quickly,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 PORTUGUESE DEBT
 Portuguese debt yields hit new highs on Friday after
Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's credit ratings and
warned it could cut them again. Investors were also
disappointed after EU leaders delayed finalizing a package set
up to bail out failing peripheral economies. [ID:nL3E7EO3OJ]
 The euro's failure to break through option barriers around
$1.4250 this week has seen some traders cut back long exposure.
Further resistance lies near $1.4280, the November high.
Support is seen around $1.4036, the high set on March 7.
 Technical analysts said a weekly close above $1.4200 would
leave it well positioned for a further rise.
 European leaders reached agreement on a new package of
anti-crisis measures at a two-day summit but were forced to
delay increasing their rescue fund. See [ID:nLDE72O009]
 AUSSIE PEAK
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar hit a 29-year peak of
against the U.S. currency at $1.0294 .
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 81.40 yen , but any
rise is expected to be capped by reported offers at 81.30-45
yen, with resistance also coming from the 21-day moving average
around 81.49 yen.
 Net long positions in favor of the yen rose to the tune of
34,525 contracts, up from 30,230 the prior week, data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday, despite
efforts by Japanese authorities to weaken the yen.
 But the change was mostly a drop in short contracts. Short
positions fell 4,414 contracts to 17,959 contracts while long
contracts rose just 119 to 52,484 contracts.
 Yen open interest fell 2,650 contracts to 112,051
contracts.

 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, March 25 (Reuters) - China said on Friday it
complied with ""most measures at issue"" in an international trade
ruling made against its restrictions on copyright-intensive
goods such as books and music.
 China's statement made in Geneva at the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) headquarters came six days after a deadline
to comply with the WTO ruling elapsed, and follows a sharp words
on the subject from complainant the United States, with which
China is involved in a series of WTO trade disputes.
 The United States says China's restrictions on goods such as
books, newspapers, films, DVDs and music create demand for
pirated goods.
 China lost a WTO appellate body ruling in December 2009 and
agreed with the United States that it would implement the
decision by March 19, 2011.
 China said the dispute was ""embodied with more complexity
and sensitivity than other disputes"".
 ""China made tremendous efforts to implement the DSB's
rulings and recommendations and so far has completed amendments
to most measures at issue,"" it said, referring to the WTO's
dispute settlement body.
 The United States repeated that it was ""troubled"" by the
lack of progress made.

 * People in zone 20-30 km from plant encouraged to leave
 * More than 10,000 dead, 17,500 missing after quake, tsunami
(Adds disaster's impact on fishing industry)	
 By Chizu Nomiyama and Shinichi Saoshiro	
 TOKYO, March 26 (Reuters) - Radiation levels have soared in
seawater near Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,
officials said on Saturday, as engineers struggled to stabilise
the power station two weeks after it was hit by a massive
earthquake and tsunami.	
 Tests on Friday showed iodine 131 levels in seawater 30 km
(19 miles) from the coastal nuclear complex had spiked 1,250
times higher than normal, but it was not considered a threat to
marine life or food safety, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency said.	
 ""Ocean currents will disperse radiation particles and so it
will be very diluted by the time it gets consumed by fish and
seaweed,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a senior agency official.	
 Despite that reassurance, the disclosure may well heighten
international concern over Japanese seafood exports. Several
countries have already banned milk and produce from areas around
the Fukushima Daiichi plant, while others have been monitoring
Japanese seafood. 
 The prolonged efforts to prevent a catastrophic meltdown at
the plant have also intensified concern around the world about
nuclear power. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was
time to reassess the international atomic safety regime.

 Engineers were trying to pump radioactive water out of the
power plant 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, after it was
found in buildings housing three of the six reactors. On
Thursday, three workers sustained burns at reactor No. 3 after
being exposed to radiation levels 10,000 times higher than
usually found in a reactor.	
 The crisis at the nuclear plant has overshadowed a big
relief and recovery effort from the magnitude 9.0 quake and the
huge tsunami it triggered on March 11 that left more than 27,500
people dead or missing in northeast Japan.	
 
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said it was
using fresh water instead of seawater to cool down at least some
of the reactors after concern arose that salt deposits might
hamper the cooling process.	
 Two of the plant's reactors are now seen as safe but the
other four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and smoke.
However, the nuclear safety agency said on Saturday that
temperature and pressure in all reactors had stabilised.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Friday the situation at
Fukushima was ""nowhere near"" being resolved. His chief cabinet
secretary said the following day that at least it was not
deteriorating.	
 ""We are preventing the situation from worsening -- we've
restored power and pumped in fresh water -- and making basic
steps towards improvement but there is still no room for
complacency,"" Yukio Edano told a news briefing on Saturday.	
 More than 700 engineers have been working in shifts to
stabilise the plant with no end in sight.	
 At Three Mile Island, the worst nuclear power accident in
the United States, workers took just four days to stabilise the
reactor, which suffered a partial meltdown. No one was injured
and there was no radiation release above the legal limit. 
 At Chernobyl in Ukraine, the worst nuclear accident in the
world, it took weeks to ""stabilise"" what remained of the plant
and months to clean up radioactive materials and cover the site
with a concrete and steel sarcophagus.	
 So far, no significant levels of radiation have been
detected beyond the vicinity of the plant in Fukushima.	
 The U.S. Department of Energy said on its website (http://blog.energy.gov/content/situation-japan/)
no significant quantities of radiological material had been
deposited in the area around the plant since March 19, according
to tests on Friday.	
 In Tokyo, a metropolis of 13 million people, a Reuters
reading on Saturday morning showed ambient radiation of 0.22
microsieverts per hour, about six times normal for the city.
That was well within the global average of naturally occurring
background radiation of 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour, a
range given by the World Nuclear Association.	
 The Japanese government has prodded tens of thousands of
people living in a 20 km-30 km (12-18 mile) zone beyond the
stricken complex to leave. Edano said the residents should move
because it was difficult to get supplies to the area, and not
because of elevated radiation.	
 Kazuo Suzuki, 56, who has moved from his house near the
nuclear plant to an evacuation centre, said neighbours he had
talked to by telephone said delivery trucks were not going to
the exclusion zone because of radiation worries.	
 ""So goods are running out, meaning people have to drive to
the next town to buy things. But there is a fuel shortage there
too, so they have to wait in long queues for gasoline to use the
car."" 
 Radiation levels at the evacuation centre were within a
normal range of about 0.16 microsievert, according to a Reuters
geiger counter reading.	
 In Japan's northeast, more than a quarter of a million
people remain in shelters, and the impact on livelihoods is
becoming clearer. The quake and tsunami not only wiped out homes
and businesses but also a fishing industry that was the
lifeblood of coastal communities.	
 ""Fishermen lost their gear, ships and just about
everything. About half will probably get out of the business,""
said Yuko Sasaki, a fishmonger in the tsunami-hit city of
Kamaishi. 
 The double disaster probably destroyed aqua farms for
abalone, sea urchins, oysters, scallops and seaweed that
authorities say account for 80 percent of the revenue of the
region's fisheries.	
 The tsunami obliterated centuries-old fishing ports along
the northeast coast, sending ships adrift in the Pacific Ocean,
to the bottom of the sea, or depositing them on land, where they
now lie among the splintered remains of homes.

 By Andrei Khalip and Shrikesh Laxmidas
 LISBON, March 25 (Reuters) - Portugal's political leaders
urged the president on Friday to call a snap election in late
May or early June after the Socialist prime minister's
resignation, rejecting the option of a coalition cabinet.
 The crisis could force Portugal to request a bailout from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund after months
of desperate struggle to avoid one, and make it the third euro
zone country to seek aid after Greece and Ireland.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates' resignation was sparked by
parliament's rejection on Wednesday of his minority government's
austerity measures aimed at averting a bailout. 
 Pedro Passos Coelho, the leader of the main opposition
Social Democrats (PSD) party that leads opinion polls, said he
had suggested a May 29 election date during talks with President
Anibal Cavaco Silva -- the earliest date possible by law.
 ""I told the president that in our opinion the way to
overcome the political crisis... is to call an early election.
We are convinced the election has to take place as soon as
possible and we proposed May 29,"" he told reporters.
 Earlier, other opposition party leaders suggested a May 29
or June 5 election. None mentioned a coalition -- an option the
president has to consider but which analysts deem extremely
unlikely.
 The political crisis prompted Standard & Poor's and Fitch to
downgrade Portugal's credit ratings and pushed Portuguese debt
yields to record highs.
 S&P's two-notch cut, which came with a warning it could
downgrade the debt-laden state further as soon as next week,
depending on the final shape of the euro zone bailout fund, hit
the euro. S&P now rates Portugal lower than Ireland.
 European leaders agreed a new package of anti-crisis
measures at a two-day summit, but delayed increasing their
rescue fund until June and acknowledged they faced new threats
from the Portuguese political crisis.
 A sell-off in Portuguese bonds pushed the yield on its
10-year benchmark above 8 percent, a euro lifetime high and a
cost of funding that is widely viewed as unsustainable.
 The spread between Portuguese debt and safer German Bunds
widened 13 basis points to 474 bps, while the cost of insuring
its debt against default also rose.
 
 SOCRATES AT EU SUMMIT
 Cavaco Silva's next move will be to summon his Council of
State advisory body. He can then dissolve parliament and call an
election. His final decision is unlikely to come on Friday.
 Socrates is likely to stay on as a caretaker prime minister
with limited powers until a new government is formed.
 Attending the European Union summit in Brussels, Socrates
reiterated Portugal needed no bailout and would continue to
issue debt despite yields considered as prohibitive by analysts.
 ""Portugal does not need any rescue fund or foreign help and
it will defend itself... Portugal has the conditions to finance
itself in the market,"" Socrates said, insisting a bailout would
hurt the economy and mean more sacrifice for the Portuguese.
 PSD's Passos Coelho said earlier he would prefer the country
avoid a bailout and has committed himself to meeting the budget
deficit goals promised to Brussels. His party has not said
clearly how it plans to meet the budget goals but has not ruled
out raising value-added tax.
 Rating agency Moody's on Friday maintained Portugal's A3
grade with a negative outlook, citing ""strong commitment to
fiscal consolidation by both leading political parties"".
 ""Whatever government will come, it will take very similar
measures, because the situation is very difficult now,"" said
Andre Freire, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon.
 ""What seems to be sure is that the bailout is coming because
the situation now is very bad, the interest rates are going
up... It's a matter of time,"" he added.
 An opinion poll on Friday showed the PSD would win an
absolute majority if elections were held today.
 The Socialists' fall has left Portugal in limbo, with legal
experts guessing whether a caretaker government could ask for an
international rescue if needed. Portugal has a large volume of
debt maturing in the next few months.
 Most economists agree Lisbon should be able to repay around
4.3 billion euros ($6.05 billion) of bonds falling due in April,
but 4.9 billion euros due in June may trigger a request for aid.

1404,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2011 02:32PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-EU plans wider US biodiesel import duties - sources," * EU executive says U.S. industry evaded biodiesel tariffs
 * Commission plans to battle transhipments via Canada
 * Duties could apply to all U.S. biodiesel blends
 * Plan highlights global race for renewable energy market
 
 (Adds details, background, bullet points)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - The European Union executive
plans to extend punitive duties on biodiesel imports from the
United States after finding U.S. exporters have been evading
tariffs illegally, people familiar with the case said on Friday.
 According to initial plans by the European Commission,
biodiesel blends imported from Canada and U.S. biodiesel mixed
with more than 80 percent of mineral diesel will face tariffs of
more than 400 euros ($566.4) per tonne, the sources told
Reuters.
 If approved by EU governments, the duties would be in place
by November 2011 and stay in place until 2014. 
 Canadian exporters BIOX Corp and Rothsay Biodiesel,
affiliated to Maple Leaf Foods Inc, are to be exempted under the
plan, the sources said.
 ""The Commission found the two companies were able to prove
they were not involved in circumvention,"" said one source.
 The plan highlights the growing battle to clinch a slice of
a renewable energy market that is growing amid global efforts to
fight climate change. It is likely to sour talks for a
multi-billion dollar trade deal between the EU and Canada
already troubled by EU environmental standards.
 It centres on allegations that U.S. exporters have been
shipping biodiesel to Europe via third countries and switching
to diesel blends containing less than one in five parts of
biodiesel to avoid high duties imposed on U.S. diesel blended
with 20 percent or more of biodiesel.
 The EU imposed those duties in 2009 after it found U.S.-made
biodiesel was illegally subsidised and that exporters were
selling it below cost on the EU market.
 U.S. exports to the EU plummeted after the duties were
launched, while Canadian sales to the EU soared to more than
140,000 tonnes in 2009, from about 1,700 tonnes in 2008,
according to EU data.
Singapore, which had also been investigated as a potential
transhipment port for U.S. biodiesel, will be exempt from duties
under the plan, the sources said.
 European biodiesel producers have been demanding that the EU
extend the scope of the trade measures to make up for damage
caused to EU producers.
 The plan -- on which EU industry, U.S. and Canadian
exporters and later EU governments must comment -- is likely to
open debate on the EU's strategy for sourcing fuel from
renewable sources and questions on what measures are allowed
under EU law to battle circumvention.

 U.S. non-farm payrolls data for March will be released on
Friday. Always a key indicator for foreign exchange markets,
the report will be more closely watched than usual for a clue
as to when U.S. interests rates may rise.
 ""Strong payrolls data next week would give hawks within the
Fed more ammunition and could raise the risk of an adjustment
to the bank's official statement following its next policy
meeting,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. ""Such a scenario
would add significantly to the dollar's relative yield appeal.""
 The euro  was last down 0.7 percent at $1.4077,
having earlier hit a session low of $1.40578 on trading
platform EBS.
 The euro is also being pressured in the short run on
concern about a worsening debt crisis in Portugal following the
collapse of the country's government.
 But investors also say that while a pullback in the single
currency is likely, the euro should be supported as long as it
holds above $1.40. Expectations of a euro-zone interest rate
rise next month have helped its resilience despite worries
about heavily indebted Portugal and Spain.
 ""For most of the week the market has treated Portugal as an
isolated problem that will not spread to other parts of Europe,
but this sentiment is losing popularity very quickly,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
 PORTUGUESE DEBT
 Portuguese debt yields hit new highs on Friday after
Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's credit ratings and
warned it could cut them again. Investors were also
disappointed after EU leaders delayed finalizing a package set
up to bail out failing peripheral economies. [ID:nL3E7EO3OJ] 
 The euro's failure to break through option barriers around
$1.4250 this week has seen some traders cut back long exposure.
Further resistance lies near $1.4280, the November high.
Support is seen around $1.4036, the high set on March 7.
Technical analysts said a weekly close above $1.4200 would
leave it well positioned for a further rise.
 ""However a failure to establish above the 1.4200 level
could result in a large bearing reversal in the pair, as the
level represents a descending channel top going back to June of
2009,"" said Brendan McGrath, senior analyst at Wester Union
Business Solutions in Victoria, British Columbia.
 European leaders reached agreement on a new package of
anti-crisis measures at a two-day summit but were forced to
delay increasing their rescue fund and acknowledged they faced
new threats from a government collapse in Portugal. See

 AUSSIE PEAK
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar hit a 29-year peak of

 * Partners aim for global deal to protect heritage brands
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BEIJING, March 25 (Reuters) - The European Union and China
have agreed to give more trade protection to traditional
products such as Parma ham and Longjing green tea, an effort to
boost trade in high-end heritage goods.
 The deal was reached during a visit by the EU's top
agriculture official to China, which ended on Friday, and is due
to be formally implemented by both parties in the coming months.
 ""EU exports of high quality products to China increased by
50 percent in 2010. This agreement will offer greater legal
protection against counterfeit goods for these products on the
EU and Chinese markets,"" EU agriculture commissioner Dacian
Ciolos said.
 Sales of heritage foods, wines and spirits are worth some 40
billion euros ($56.64 billion) annually to the EU economy, with
global exports accounting for about 10 percent of the total.
 The EU's executive - the European Commission -- hopes the
agreement with China to protect 10 ""geographical indication""
(GI) products from each side will be extended to dozens more
products in future, and ultimately lead to a similar accord
globally.
 
 RIVAL CAMPS
 The EU and China, together with Brazil and India, are key
proponents in a bloc of over 100 countries in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) calling for an agreement on GI products in
ongoing talks on a global free trade deal.
 But they face strong opposition from countries including the
United States, Canada and Australia, who see global protection
of GIs as a threat to existing ""generic"" trademarks for
domestically-produced goods such as Feta cheese and Parma Ham.
 Canadian company Maple Leaf Meats, for example, has a
trademark giving it the exclusive rights to the terms ""Parma
ham"" and ""Prosciutto di Parma"", meaning exports of Parma ham
from Italy are not allowed to bear these names.
 Ultimately any global agreement on GI protection will most
likely have to be hammered out as part of a deal in the Doha
round of world trade talks.
 But with WTO countries still seemingly far from an accord,
the EU is already preparing for talks to extend its bilateral
cooperation with China further, to cover to up to 100 to 200
products.
 ""There would be a clear benefit to EU producers, who want to
see GIs given effective protection in non-EU countries where
these products are exported,"" said Frank Fay, deputy head of the
Commission's product policy quality unit.
 
 GROWING MARKET
 Extending the scope of the bloc's cooperation with China
could take some time.
 Talks on the current product agreement began back in 2007,
and it will only finally enter force later this year.
 But with EU agricultural exports to China experiencing
phenomenal growth, particularly for quality brands, the
potential rewards are significant.
 Spirits currently lead the way, with EU exports having risen
more than tenfold since 2002 to 400 million euros last year.
 But with the EU's share at just one percent of a Chinese
market for spirits estimated at 40 billion euros annually by the
Commission, European producers such as Diagio and Pernod Ricard
are keen to capitalise on the country's growing taste for
imported brands.
 Chinese producers too are likely to benefit from increased
trade cooperation, with the country currently enjoying a surplus
in trade in agricultural products with the EU, with exports
worth 3.9 billion euros compared with imports worth 3.3 billion.

 The Aussie dollar was boosted by an increase in risk
appetite, with high Australian interest rates enhancing its
appeal for global investors.
 US JOBS DATA
 The single currency has risen in recent weeks on
expectations the European Central Bank will raise interest
rates as early as April.
 Such a move would further move the yield differential in
favor of the euro, as the U.S. Federal Reserve last week
reiterated its pledge to keep interest rates -- now at
virtually zero -- at very low levels for an extended period.
 Data on Friday showing the U.S. economy grew more rapidly

optimism about the recovery and supported the greenback.

payrolls data, due out next Friday. Economists polled by
Reuters are expecting job gains of about 190,000. [ECI/US]
 ""If we see another month of strong payrolls, that's a
signal that the Fed may start to shift its language at its next
meeting. If that's the case, then we can see some real
underlying support for the dollar begin to build,"" said Omer
Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange
in Washington.
 Analysts said the yen could gain in the coming week as
inflows ahead of the Japanese fiscal year-end on March 31 pick
up. Japanese exporters usually sell the dollar ahead of the

 * Yet to benefit fully from price surge due to contracts
 * Will seek preferential terms in west Africa
 
 By Duncan Miriri
 NAIROBI, March 25 (Reuters) - Swaziland's sugar production
is likely to jump by a quarter in the next five years, thanks to
more land being put under cultivation, an industry group said on
Friday.
 Mike Matsebula, chief executive of Swaziland Sugar
Association, told Reuters at a conference on sugar in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi the southern African producer of the sweetener
will also raise production by about 11 percent this year.
 ""We are currently producing, in round numbers, 600,000
tonnes (per year). In five years, we will be producing an
additional 150,000 tonnes at least,"" he said.
 Sugar is the second biggest source of foreign exchange for
the country, ranked third-largest sugar producer in Africa.
 ""More land is being brought under cane. There is at least
two major irrigation projects, which are intended to provide
water for more cane that is going to be cultivated,"" Matsebula
said.
 He put the new land to be planted with sugar at 12,000
hectares in the next five years and 1,000 this year, on top of
the 44,000 hectares already under cultivation.
 Although it has low lying lands with good soil and a warm
climate ideal for sugar growing, a drought cut its production to
582,000 tonnes last year from just over 600,000 tonnes in 2009.
 But that will also serve to spur the expected jump in
production this year, Matsebula said. ""We are starting from a
lower base than it would have been the case otherwise,"" he said.
 
 PREFERENTIAL ARRANGEMENTS
 Swaziland exports half of its sugar output to east Africa
and Europe, while the rest is consumed locally and in the
Southern Africa Customs Union, under the Southern African
Development Community, which is treated as a domestic market.
 ""We are investigating west Africa and we are doing so
jointly as the SADC sugar industries because as an individual
country we can't compete with the present supplier to west
Africa because of distance and other logistical considerations,""
Matsebula said.
 But to get to that market, SADC will seek preferential terms
to compete with other suppliers, mainly Brazil, which enjoys low
freight costs due to bulk-shipping, he added.
 ""For us to be able to really exploit the west African
markets there has to be preferential arrangements given by west
Africa,"" he said.
 Although Swaziland is one of the more efficient producers in
Africa at 14 cents per lb, the industry faces challenges from
rising energy costs. Electricity is used to power irrigation
pumps while coal is used to fire boilers.
 It has also not benefited from the jump in the international
price of sugar, which hit a 30-year high in February of 36.08
cents a lb but has since fallen back and was trading on Friday
at around 27.30 cents.
 ""Because you have long term contracts, then you are not able
to benefit from those spikes ... we have only benefited a little
bit where we were able to move uncommitted sugar to the world
market including east Africa,"" Matsebula said.
 ""It gives us good lessons going forward. We now have to
revise our marketing strategy and make sure that we can
anticipate such developments in future.""
 Of the three sugar mills in the country, two are owned by
the Royal Swaziland Sugar Corporation, while the other one is
jointly held by South Africa's Illovo Sugar and a local firm.

 * Will urge equal payments to farmers during EU presidency
 * Says EU should intervene to calm price volatility now
 
 By Gabriela Baczynska and Maciej Onoszko
 WARSAW, March 25 (Reuters) - Poland wants the European Union
to keep farm spending at current levels in the next multi-year
budget for 2014-20 and, during its presidency of the bloc later
this year, will champion the idea of equal payments per hectare.
 Polish Farm Minister Marek Sawicki also told Reuters in an
interview that the EU should intervene aggressively to tame
price volatility of agricultural products.
 The 27-nation EU is heading towards a reform of its Common
Agriculture Policy (CAP) as part of efforts to cement a deal on
the next long-term budget, but radical change is unlikely
despite calls from Britain and Sweden.
 The CAP currently costs some 55 billion euros ($77.9
billion) a year, or about 40 percent of overall EU spending. 
 ""None of the proposals on the table is currently acceptable
to Poland. We will be working with the European Commission
aiming to have our proposals included in the final CAP
document,"" Sawicki said.
 Warsaw wants equal direct payments per hectare to farmers
across the bloc, a move opposed by France, Germany and other
states. Poland also wants to stop calculating payments based on
historical production and switch to an area-based target. 
 The size of payments currently ranges from less than 100
euros per hectare in Latvia to above 400 euros in Greece, Malta
and Belgium, with the average set at around 270 euros.
 ""If politicians don't understand that subsidies must be
calculated on the basis of just rules, the whole CAP will fall
apart,"" Sawicki said.
 The Commission, the EU's executive arm, is due to make
legislative proposals in October, midway through Poland's
six-month presidency of the bloc. Poland is a net beneficiary of
the CAP, as are France, Spain and Italy, among others.
 Sawicki said it was unrealistic to expect a rise in the CAP
budget, given the financial woes of many member states, but he
added that spending should remain intact due to increased
responsibilities handed to farmers under a 2008 CAP reform.
 ""CAP funding must remain at least at current levels to allow
it to deliver on all its (new) tasks,"" he said, referring to
environmental protection and promotion of renewable energy.
 
 INTERVENTION
 Sawicki dismissed suggestions that EU subsidies contributed
to rising food price inflation and blamed speculation, adding
that farmers were not benefiting from the higher prices.
 ""Europe should actively use the mechanism of intervention
purchases. And the purchase price should not be lower than
production costs,"" he said, adding that he saw appropriate wheat
prices at 125-130 euros per tonne.
 ""One year we pay 110 euros and then 240 euros per tonne of
wheat. If at least some of it were stored, the price would be
much less volatile.""
 EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said on Thursday
that establishing public grain stocks to combat food price
volatility was unlikely. Sawicki criticised the commissioner's
comments as ""irresponsible"".
 Sawicki said the EU and other international institutions
such as the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the
G-20 should make deliveries obligatory for agricultural goods
bought on the futures market to help curb speculation.
 ""Food markets are specific, they are not like any other
market. The wars in the Arab world did not stem from a longing
for democracy but for bread. If the Euro-Atlantic community
wants to avoid conflicts, it must introduce mechanisms to limit
speculation on food markets,"" Sawicki said.

 * Poultry transport banned within 1 km zone around farm
 
 AMSTERDAM, March 25 (Reuters) - Dutch authorities said on
Friday they will cull about 127,500 egg-laying hens on a farm in
the south of the country after the H7 bird flu strain was
detected.
 The virus was reported at a farm in the village Schore in
Zeeland province, around 170 kilometres south-west of Amsterdam
near the border with Belgium, the Dutch ministry for economic
affairs, agriculture and innovation said in a statement.
 Authorities imposed a ban on transporting poultry and eggs
in an area of 1 kilometre around the farm, the statement said.
 The government said more tests will be conducted to indicate
whether the H7 strain was low-pathogenic or a more dangerous
high-pathogenic strain. The results will be available later on
Friday.
 The most devastating outbreak of H7N7 avian flu strain in
the Netherlands was in 2003 and led to the culling of 30 million
birds, about a third of the nation's poultry flock.
 H7 bird flu in its highly pathogenic form can kill large
numbers of birds and can occasionally infect people, although it
is rarely fatal in humans.
 According to 2009 government figures there are approximately
32 million egg-laying hens in the Netherlands in addition to 46
million chicken grown for meat production.
 The Netherlands produces around 9.7 billion eggs annually,
accounting for more than 7 percent of the total European Union
production.
 Its biggest export market is Germany, which buys two thirds
of its total egg exports.

 * Germany gets delay in timetable to pay into permanent fund
 * Portugal PM's resignation overshadow EU summit
 * Lame duck Lisbon government rejects early bailout bid

(Recasts with Merkel and Zapatero quotes, economist, markets)
 By Noah Barkin and Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - European leaders agreed a new
package of anti-crisis measures at a two-day summit, but were
forced to delay increasing their rescue fund and acknowledged
they faced new threats from a government collapse in Portugal.
 Battling to stem a debt crisis that has raged for over a
year and pushed both Greece and Ireland to accept bailouts, the
EU had promised to unveil a comprehensive solution at the March
24-25 summit that it hoped would reassure jittery markets.
 But the abrupt resignation of Portuguese Prime Minister Jose
Socrates on the eve of the meeting, after his austerity measures
were rejected by parliament, cast a long shadow. Uncertainty in
other euro members such as Finland and Ireland also prevented
leaders finalising fundamental elements of their plan.
 ""The euro has survived a critical test but there is lots of
homework to be done,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told
reporters, saying the bloc needed to ""atone for past sins"".
 ""This is a comprehensive package which I think is a big step
forward. Whether it will be sufficient, only time will tell.""
 Yields on Portugal's 10-year benchmark bonds pushed above 8
percent to a new record on Friday, a rate seen as unsustainable
for a country which needs to refinance about 4.5 billion euros
of debt in April and a similar amount in June.
 Leaders were able to seal a deal on funding for the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM) a new, permanent safety net that will
become operational from mid-2013.
 Merkel backtracked before the summit on a deal that would
have forced Germany, Europe's biggest economy and paymaster, to
put up 11 billion euros for the fund in its first year, reducing
her wiggle room for tax cuts before the next election.
 Under the compromise, capital injections totalling 80
billion euros for all euro zone members will be spread out over
five years rather than three, with smaller instalments.
 Euro zone leaders also formally backed the ""Euro Plus Pact"",
a list of areas for expanded economic policy harmonisation which
has been renamed three times because of sensitivities in various
individual member states.
 Six EU states that do not use the single currency --
Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania --
joined the 17 euro states in backing the pact, in part out of
worries they could be excluded from future policy talks.
 Britain, Sweden, Czech Republic and Hungary remain out.
 
 NEXT DOMINO
 In other areas the summit fell short of expectations.
 Although leaders had agreed in principle earlier this month
to boost the lending capacity of their temporary safety net --
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) -- to 440
billion euros from roughly 250 billion, they had to push this
back until mid-year because of looming elections in Finland.
 A deal on debt relief for Ireland has also been delayed
pending the results of bank stress tests due next week which
could show a sharp deterioration in the balance sheets of the
country's stricken financial institutions.
 Concerns are growing that Irish banks could require more
capital than the 35 billion euros set aside for them under last
year's EU/IMF bailout.
 Portugal is widely expected to be the next euro zone domino
to fall after Ireland and Greece.
 Socrates, the second euro zone leader to fall victim to the
bloc's sovereign debt crisis after ousted Irish prime minister
Brian Cowen, attended the summit despite having submitted his
resignation late on Wednesday.
 He made clear his continued opposition to asking for a
bailout, and said that whatever Portuguese government next comes
to power, it would stand by its fiscal commitments.
 Portugal's president was consulting with political leaders
in Lisbon on Friday to decide whether to call snap elections. If
he does, by law they cannot be held before nearly two months
have expired.
 Any decision on whether to seek a bailout may therefore only
be taken in May, meaning more weeks of limbo for markets.
 
 CONTAGION FEARS
 ""Whether a new political mandate will be enough to implement
the inevitable austerity measures is doubtful, although the
opposition has committed itself to the general deficit targets,""
Unicredit economists said in a note on Friday.
 ""What is more likely, in contrast, is that the EMU-wide
political and public conflict over the costs of the debt crisis
and the design of an anti-crisis mechanism will increase.""
 Reflecting the uncertainty, both Standard & Poor's and Fitch
cut Portugal's credit rating by two notches.
 Should Lisbon opt for a rescue, senior euro zone officials
have said it will likely need 60-80 billion euros in assistance
from the EU rescue fund and the International Monetary Fund.
 With Portugal close to the brink, attention could shift to
Spain, which has gradually won back the confidence of investors
by unveiling reforms of the labour market and pension system, as
well as a plan for shoring up its ailing savings banks.
 While the spreads of Portuguese 10-year bond yields over
benchmark German bonds have climbed to new highs, those of
Spanish bonds have fallen to their lowest level in nearly two
months.
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on
Friday he did not fear contagion from Portugal despite the close
economic ties between the neighbours. Spanish banks hold roughly
a third of Portuguese debt.
 But he pledged to take additional measures to strengthen
state finances, nonetheless.
 ""In my opinion we are in a position to withstand the
political situation in Portugal,"" Zapatero said.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2011 11:04AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 11-Radiation fears mount again in Japan after plant workers hurt," * Uncertainty over source of high radiation at plant
 * People in zone 20-30 km from plant encouraged to leave
 * More than 10,000 people dead; 17,500 missing
 * China says travellers from Japan found contaminated
(Adds comment from operator)	
 By Mayumi Negishi and Kazunori Takada	
 TOKYO, March 25 (Reuters) - Radiation fears escalated in
Japan on Friday after workers suffered burns as they tried to
cool an earthquake-crippled nuclear power station, while the
government sowed confusion over whether it was widening an
evacuation zone around the plant.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, making his first public statement
on the crisis in a week, said the situation at the Fukushima
nuclear complex north of Tokyo was ""nowhere near the point"" of
being resolved.	
 ""We are making efforts to prevent it from getting worse, but
I feel we cannot become complacent,"" he told reporters. ""We must
continue to be on our guard.""	
 The comments reflected a spike of unease in Japan after
several days of slow but steady progress in containing the
nuclear accident, which was triggered by a devastating
earthquake and tsunami two weeks ago.	
 The 9.0 magnitude quake and giant waves it triggered left
more than 10,000 people dead and 17,500 missing.	
 As shocking as that toll is, much attention since the March
11 disaster has been on the possibility of a catastrophic
meltdown at Fukushima, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.	
 The government prodded tens of thousands of
people living in a 20 km-30 km (12-18 mile) zone beyond the
stricken complex to leave, but insisted it was not widening a 20
km evacuation zone.	
 
 China, meanwhile, said two Japanese travellers arriving in
the country were found to have very high levels of radiation.	
 Three workers trying to cool one of the most critical
reactors at the plant were exposed to radiation levels 10,000
times higher than normal, raising the possibility of a leak of
radioactive material through a crack in the core's container. 
 That would mean a serious reversal following slow progress
in getting the plant back under control.	
 The reactor, No. 3 of six, is the only one to use plutonium
in its fuel mix which is more toxic than the uranium used in the
other reactors. The government called for an investigation into
why such high levels of radiation had suddenly appeared.	
 More than 700 engineers have been working in shifts to
stabilise the plant but they pulled back from some parts when
the workers were hurt on Thursday. Two of the men suffered
radiation burns when contaminated water seeped over their
shoes . 
 Nuclear agency official Hidehiko Nishiyama said there was a
possibility of damage to the reactor but he later told
reporters: ""It could be from venting operations and there could
be some water leakage from pipes or from valves, but there is no
data suggesting a crack.""	
 Hideo Morimoto, director at the Agency for Natural Resources
and Energy, also played down fears.	
 ""I feel if the pressure vessel has been seriously damaged,
then far more radiation would have leaked,"" he said.	
 U.N. nuclear watchdog IAEA said a total of 17 workers had
received elevated levels of radiation since the operations
began, but the other 14 did not suffer burns. 
 Two of the reactors are now seen as safe but the other
four are volatile, occasionally emitting steam and smoke. But
work is advancing to restart water pumps to cool their fuel
rods. 
 Authorities have been using seawater to cool the
rectors but that is not ideal as it corrosive and leaves salt
deposits that constrict the amount of water that can cool the
rods. 
 Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO)
said it started injecting freshwater into the pressure vessels
of reactors No.1 and No.3 and expected to start injecting
freshwater into No. 2 soon. 
 The United States has offered to help with two barges
with 525,000 gallons (2.0 million litres) of freshwater. 
 
 RADIATION IN TRAVELLERS	
 Chinese authorities said two travellers who arrived in the
eastern city of Wuxi from Tokyo were found to have levels of
radiation that ""seriously exceeded the limit"" although they
presented no risk to others. 
 Up to now, no one in Japan except workers at the stricken
plant has been found with seriously elevated radiation levels,
and departing airline passengers are not being screened.	
 Japan's chief cabinet secretary said 130,000 people living
in an outer circle around Fukushima should consider leaving,
although he insisted it was because of the difficulties
in getting them supplies and was not an evacuation order.	
 ""Given how prolonged the situation has become, we think it
would be desirable for people to voluntarily evacuate,"" Yukio
Edano said.	
 Japan cleared about 70,000 people from a 20-km (12-mile)
zone around the plant soon after the earthquake and tsunami.	
 Edano has maintained there was no need to expand the
evacuation zone, but an official at the Science Ministry
confirmed that daily radiation levels in an area 30 km (18
miles) northwest of the plant had exceeded the annual limit.

 FEAR OVER FOOD	
 Alarm about radiation is spreading at home and beyond.	
 Vegetable and milk shipments from near the plant have been
stopped, and Tokyo's 13 million residents were told this week
not to give tap water to babies after contamination from rain
put radiation at twice the safety level. 
 It dropped back to safe levels the next day, and the city
governor cheerily drank tap water in front of cameras.	
 Experts say radiation from the plant is still generally
below levels of exposure from flights or medical X-rays.	
 Nevertheless, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, the
United States and Hong Kong are restricting food and milk
imports from the zone. Other nations are screening Japanese
food, and German shipping lines are simply avoiding the country.	
 In Japan's north, more than a quarter of a million people
are in shelters. Exhausted rescuers are still sifting through
the wreckage of towns and villages, retrieving bodies.	
 Amid the suffering, though, there was a sense that Japan was
turning the corner. Aid flowed to refugees, and phone,
electricity, postal and bank services have resumed, though the
can still be patchy.	
 Owners of small businesses have begun cleaning up.	
 ""Everybody on this block has the firm belief that they are
going to bring this thing back again,"" said Maro Kariya in the
town of Kamaishi, as he cleared debris from a family coffee
shop.	
 The estimated $300 billion damage makes it the world's
costliest natural disaster. Global financial market jitters over
the crisis have calmed, though supply disruptions are affecting
the automobile and technology sectors.	
 Foreigner investor buying of Japanese shares actually
reached a record high in the week after the disaster, data
showed, as bargain-hunters jumped in on an initial plunge.

 * EU plan to include oil shale, tar sand values - Hedegaard
 BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - European Union governments
may begin talks in the coming months on a proposal to promote
greener fuels, potentially black-listing fuels whose production
is more polluting, according to Europe's climate chief.
 EU Climate Change Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said default
emission values for fuel derived from tar sands and oil shale --
widespread in Canada and Estonia -- will be peer reviewed and
included in the proposal.
 ""I now expect that a proposal could be discussed with the
member states in the coming months,"" Hedegaard told EU lawmakers
this week.
 ""It is the Commission's intention, at this stage, to present
a draft implementing measure ... that will include default
values both for oil sands and for oil shale,"" she added.
 European Union sources said last month that Canada
threatened to pull out of trade talks if Europe blacklisted tar
sands, but Ottawa has denied that.
 The European Commission initially proposed last year that
tar sands be ascribed a greenhouse gas value of 107 grams per
megajoule of fuel -- making clear to buyers that it had far
greater environmental impact than average crude oil at 87.1
grams.
 But the European Union later appeared to back down on the
issue, putting commerce ahead of a strategy to curb greenhouse
gases from transport fuels by 6 percent this decade.
 The inclusion of default values for shale oil -- whose use
EU member state Estonia has been promoting -- may help to head
off any complaint by Canada to the World Trade Organization that
the green fuel norms discriminate against it.
 Hedegaard said she had consulted closely with EU trade chief
Karel De Gucht ""to ensure that our approach is robust in terms
of our obligations under international law"".

 By Rodrigo Campos and Mike Peacock
 NEW YORK/LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - The euro slipped
against the dollar on Friday on increasing concern about the
worsening debt crisis in Portugal after S&P downgraded the
country's rating, while world stocks eked out gains on signs of
a buoyant economy.
 Portuguese debt yields hit new highs on Friday after
Standard & Poor's downgraded its ratings and warned it could
cut them again. But the pressure for now did not spread toward
other markets.
 The downgrade prompted ""one of the first major rejection of
Portuguese assets,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency
research at GFT in New York. ""For most of the week the market
has treated Portugal as an isolated problem that will not
spread to other parts of Europe but this sentiment is losing
popularity very quickly.""
 U.S. stocks rose in early trade after the government
reported the U.S. economy grew more quickly than previously
estimated in the last quarter of 2010 as businesses maintained
fairly solid spending and restocked shelves to meet rising
demand.
 An optimistic outlook by software maker Oracle fueled hopes
that a global resurgence in technology spending remained
intact. 
 ""When you get an upward revision (in GDP), along with some
very good earnings out of Oracle, that will give more
confidence that even with uncertainty in the rest of the world,
we're on a good footing here, and that will help stocks,"" said
Elizabeth Miller, president of Summit Place Financial Advisors
in Summit, New Jersey.
 Equity volumes have dwindled in the U.S. and other markets
including Europe, as violence in the Middle East and northern
Africa coupled with Japan's natural disasters two weeks ago and
its ongoing nuclear crisis to cloud the outlook for the global
economic recovery.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 22.78
points, or 0.19 percent, to 12,193.34. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 0.95 points, or 0.07 percent, to
1,310.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 4.38 points,
or 0.16 percent, to 2,740.80.
 The MSCI All-Country index <.MIW0000PUS> was up 0.1 percent
and was on track to post its best week in nearly four months.
 European shares traded near break-even as bullish signs on
the economy and corporate results were tempered by the euro
zone debt problems and violence in Libya.
 Portugal's president consulted political leaders on Friday
on whether to call a snap election after the Socialist prime
minister resigned after a reform was kicked down in parliament.
The crisis could force Lisbon to request a bailout from the
European Union and International Monetary Fund, becoming the
third euro zone country to seek aid, after Greece and Ireland.
For details see [ID:nLDE72N0NZ].
 The yield on 10-year Portuguese government bonds rose to a
new euro-era high above 8 percent, well above the level which
the government says is sustainable, and the premium to hold its
10-year debt rather than Germany's widened to 474 basis
points.
 The euro  was last down 0.3 percent at $1.4128,
having earlier hit a session low of $1.41133 on trading
platform EBS. Traders reported option barriers around $1.4250
and said the level will be strongly defended. Technical
analysts said a weekly close above $1.4200 would leave it well
positioned for a further rise.
 The yen traded near 81 per dollar , a level it has
clung tightly to all week since a rare coordinated intervention
by leading central banks last Friday to curb its appreciation.
 Higher-yielding currencies gained as the global economic
outlook boosted risk appetite and on growing demand for

"
1427,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2011 10:12AM ET</span>","GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-New quarter, old issues for investors"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Surprising as it may seem,
investors are heading into a new quarter in relatively buoyant
form, overcoming nerves about Japan's disasters, rising oil
prices and the EU's delay in finalising its debt crisis package.
 The first quarter was littered with weeks of ""risk on, risk
off"" trading and a lot of uncertainty remains. But it is ending
with remarkable resilience.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI are above the levels they
were at when Japan's earthquake hit. Emerging market shares,
losers for much of Q1, are nearly in the black for 2011 at
eight-week highs.
 The VIX volatility index is back down near levels not seen
since before the Egyptian unrest began stirring the oil markets.
Reuters' quarterly poll of almost 400 market analysts and
economists, released in the past week, showed all 18 stock
indexes covered in the survey finishing 2011 in positive
territory compared with current levels.
 Some, such as Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Korea's KOSPI, were
seen gaining more than 17 percent by year-end.
 Other gains were more modest, but nonetheless positive, such
as 8 percent for the U.S. S&P 500, more than 9 percent for
France's CAC 40 and a solid 13 percent plus for Germany's DAX.
 The primary driver, when everything else is stripped away,
is confidence that the global economy is in pretty good
condition and with it the corporate outlook.
 It may not feel like it to millions of people in developed
economies weighed down with debt and still recovering from
recession but at an International Monetary Fund-projected 4.7
percent, global growth is set to rise well above the roughly 3.5
percent long-term average.
 ""There is still a lot of uncertainty ... but the big thing
that has allowed markets to climb this (recent) wall of worry is
the economy,"" said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, head of
strategy at ING Investment Management.
 Recovery, he said, had spread from just manufacturing and
trade to services, making it broader and more ""shock proof"".
 Economic focus in the coming week will, therefore, be on
critical U.S., euro zone and Japanese employment reports while
the impact on world business confidence from recent events will
be monitored in global Purchasing Manager Indexes.
 
 QUITE A QUARTER
 From a purely markets perspective, however, the past three
months have thrown out some remarkable challenges -- none of
which have actually gone away.
 There is some interesting economic debate about whether the
events were actually ""Black Swans"" that no one could predict or
just far out tail risks.
 But it is probably fair to say that no one was properly
positioned for Japan's triple disasters of earthquake, tsumami
and nuclear crisis, or for a revolt in the Arab world that would
set geopolitics on its head and drive up the oil price.
 The stubborn nature of the euro zone debt crisis was
probably easier to predict, but not necessarily to position for
given the complexity of competing domestic and international
politics coming up against market demands for quick answers.
 So not everyone is entering the second quarter in a risk
positive mood, particularly with higher interest rates around
the corner from policymakers, notably the European Central Bank.
 Barclays Capital said in the past week that policy
normalisation -- higher rates -- meant its clients should take
""a more cautious approach to markets than the risk-embracing
positions we have recommended since the recovery got under way
two years ago"".
 But it did say that the Japan disasters and North
Africa/Middle East revolts should not derail the global economic
expansion.
 
 EU DEBT AGAIN
 One of the focuses of the coming week, meanwhile, is likely
to be another delay in solving the euro zone debt crisis.
 European leaders wrapped up a much heralded summit on Friday
by giving themselves until June to finalise an increase in their
temporary bailout facility, failing to deliver the broad package
they had promised.
 Markets took the failure fairly calmly, perhaps because they
are used to EU leaders extending supposedly fixed deadlines for
resolving multiple clashes of national interests.
 But Portugal, the main country under pressure at the moment,
saw its debt costs rise and was widely assumed to be heading
towards a bailout similar to those given to Greece and Ireland.

 NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
U.S. dollar on Friday and could remain under pressure in the
near term on concern about a worsening debt crisis in Portugal
following the collapse of the country's government.
 Standard & Poor's downgraded Portugal's credit ratings and
warned it could cut them again. IFR Markets reported that
European clearing house LCH.Clearnet said Portugal's bonds will
not be eligible in repo clear basket from next Monday. For

 Portuguese debt yields hit new highs on Friday. But the
pressure for now did not spread towards other markets,
signaling the contagion risk was seen low at the moment.
 European leaders agreed on Thursday to increase their
financial rescue fund to the full 440 billion euros by June,
but avoided discussing Portugal, which is under growing
pressure to seek a bailout.
 The single currency has stayed supported by expectations
the European Central Bank will raise interest rates as early as
April, boosting its yield advantage over the dollar.
 Data showing the U.S. economy grew more quickly than
previously estimated in the fourth quarter boosted optimism
about the recovery and further supported the greenback.
 ""GDP came in a little better than expected. While
relatively old news, it adds to the somewhat improved tone of
the dollar earlier this morning,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 An increase in risk appetite and growing demand for
dollar-funded carry trades saw higher-yielding currencies
gain.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar hit a 2011 high of
$1.0255 , just shy of its 29-year peak of $1.0257.
Traders cited stops above $1.0260, with option expiries at
$1.0200. Traders said model funds were adding to long positions
in the currency as were real money accounts.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 81.14 yen , but any
rise is expected to be capped by reported offers at 81.30-45
yen, with resistance also coming from the 21-day moving average
at 81.39 yen. That was well above a record low of 76.25 yen hit
last week.

 By Steve Slater 
 LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Asia-focused bank Standard
Chartered Plc paid the head of its investment bank more than $14
million for 2010, while one banker below board level received
almost $12 million, its annual report showed on Friday.
 Mike Rees, head of Standard Chartered's wholesale bank
business, earned $14.1 million last year, up 6 percent from
2009, when he was also the top paid executive.
 It makes Rees one of the world's top paid bankers, at a time
of fierce criticism of generous remumeration in the industry so
soon after the financial crisis. Standard Chartered did not take
any taxpayer bailout cash, however, and last year reported an
eighth successive record annual profit.
 New rules require more of a banker's bonus package to be
deferred and paid in shares. Rees's 2010 award included a base
pay of $926,000, a bonus of $11 million and up to $2.1 million
in shares depending on performance in the next three years.
 Sixty percent of the bonus is in deferred shares that can be
clawed back, with 20 percent in cash now and 20 percent in
upfront shares.
 Chief Executive Peter Sands was paid $7.8 million for 2010,
up from $6.9 million in 2009, when he gave much of his award to
charity.
 Standard Chartered's best-paid employee below board level
was paid $11.9 million for 2010, almost all in bonus, according
to disclosures made by the bank for the first time under new
rules. Four other bankers were paid between $7.1 million and
$8.3 million each. All five were based outside Britain.
 Profits at the London-based bank, which generates more than
four-fifths of its profit in Asia and other emerging markets,
rose 19 percent last year to $6.1 billion. Growth has largely
been due to the wholesale business, which includes investment
banking and trade finance operations.
 Costs have been rising faster than income, however, and
staff costs jumped 17 percent last year as Sands said the bank
faces a battle to attract and retain staff in its hot Asian
markets from local and international rivals.
 Its shares rose 14 percent last year, outperforming a 12
percent fall by the STOXX Europe 600 banking index.

 * Blames speculators for hike in Polish sugar retail price
 
 WARSAW, March 25 (Reuters) - Poland's farm minister urged
the European Union on Friday to raise the bloc's sugar
production cap and said the Polish consumer protection body
should investigate a recent rise in retail sugar prices.
 Poland's retail sugar prices have recently doubled to
around 6 zlotys ($2.11) per kilogram, prompting opposition
parties to step up criticism of the centre-right government over
rising living costs driven mainly by global food inflation.
 Minister Marek Sawicki said the rise in sugar prices was
driven by speculators and panic but that Brussels should
increase the cap on sugar production in the 27-nation bloc.
 ""I wouldn't suggest freeing the quota completely as yet, but
it's definitely worth considering raising EU sugar production by
15 percent, that is around 2 million tonnes,"" he told Reuters,
adding the bloc was now short of some 4 million tonnes a year.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Sawicki also criticised Poland's Office of Competition and
Consumer Protection (UOKiK) for being too slow in launching an
investigation into the recent price rise. The agency announced
its probe two days ago.
 ""For some time now, I am really surprised by the lack of
reaction from UOKiK, because it is not only meant to deal with
the market's deregulation but also with consumer protection,"" he
said. 
 ""If the producers' price stands at 2.30-2.40 zlotys for
sugar, and at the same time it appears on shops' shelves at
above 6 zlotys per kilogram, then it's clear that somebody is
making too much profit from this commodity.""
 Poland produces around 1.43 million tonnes of sugar a year
and consumes about 1.56 million tonnes, Sawicki added.
 ""Usually Polish producers export around 250,000-350,000
tonnes, and at the same time some is imported. But there is no
data now signalling any significant rise in imports,"" he said.
 Polish media have recently been full of alarming reports
about rising sugar prices as Poles rush to shops to stock up in
anticipation of further increases.
 Elsewhere in the EU, sugar prices have also jumped. In
Bulgaria, prices have risen 47 percent since the start of
January to 2.06 levs ($1.49) a kilogram.
 Sugar prices hit a 30-year-high at 36.08 cents per pound in
February but since then have eased to trade at slightly below
27.50 on Friday.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2011 08:12AM ET</span>",Japan town buries tsunami victims in solemn ceremony," By Chisa Fujioka	
 HIGASHIMATSUSHIMA, Japan, March 25 (Reuters) - Families in a
tsunami-stricken town in northeast Japan said farewell to their
loved ones in a solemn burial on Friday, sobbing as they laid
chrysanthemums and incense next to a mass grave lined with
coffins.	
 The burial for the 42 victims was especially painful for the
families because deep graves have been unthinkable in a country
where the dead are usually cremated and their ashes placed in
stone family tombs near Buddhist temples. Local regulations
often prohibit burial of bodies. 
 Crematoriums in the town of Higashimatsushima on the Pacific
coast have been overwhelmed by the number of bodies and their
incinerators cannot keep up, forcing families to resort to the
burial of bodies. Local reports say 650 people in the town lost
their lives and 430 more are still missing.	
 ""Of course, a cremation would have been better,"" said Fumiko
Akabane, 52, who was at the site to bury her nephew, Tomohide,
in the chilly wind.	
 ""We looked all around for crematoriums thinking we should
try to find one even if we had to go far. But we were told that
we would have to take the body in our own car and the body would
be damaged if we took too much time.""	
 She said the family was also unable to go far because of a
fuel shortage in the area after the tsunami, which killed over
10,000 people and left 17,500 missing.	
 ""I have no children so I loved him like my own son.""	
 Other towns obliterated by the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami are also digging mass graves, although a burial for 150
unidentified people planned for Friday in Kamaishi, north of
Higashimatsushima, was postponed.	
 Akabane's eyes welled up as military trucks rolled into the
burial site, once a recycling yard. Military officers wearing
white gloves slowly carried the wooden coffins out of the truck
and into the graves, saluting after lowering each one. 
 Families then walked in an orderly line and helped each
other down into the waist-high pit, crying as they placed
flowers, money and mementos into the coffins. One wrapped a body
in a thick blanket.	
 They brushed off any dirt on the coffins before climbing up
to the ground again and pressed their palms together in prayer.
Some then shovelled small piles of dirt over the top.	
 Akabane said the family had not yet held a funeral for
Tomohide, 27, who had tried to escape the tidal wave in a car
with his mother and grandmother. 
 He got out of the car to call the hospital where he worked
as an administrative staff but was soon swept away by the
tsunami, while his mother and grandmother survived. 
 The graves, identified with thin wood with names
hand-written in black, are temporary and those buried will be
exhumed later and cremated with a proper funeral. 
 ""Everyone in the town who survived is thinking, it could
have been me,"" said Akabane. ""Perhaps the funeral will be joint
funeral with everyone here.""

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - The euro shrugged off concerns
about a debt crisis in Portugal on Friday, supported by steady
buying by Asian central banks, while the Australian dollar
hovered near a 29-year peak versus the U.S. dollar.
 Solid support for the euro was seen around $1.4140, helping
it recover from losses after Standard & Poor's downgraded
Portugal's credit ratings and warned it could cut it again, with
analysts saying Portugal's troubles had mostly been priced in.
 The euro was also helped by a survey of German business
sentiment which was not as weak as expected.
Any gains were expected to be limited, however, keeping the
euro below a barrier at $1.4250, which traders said was being
strongly defended. But technical analysts said a weekly close
above $1.4200 would leave it well positioned for a further rise.
 Analysts said there were also hopes for some positive
signals from an EU summit, which has been clouded by a political
crisis in Portugal, where the prime minister resigned after
parliament voted down his latest batch of austerity measures.
 ""This week's high near $1.4250 is likely to act as
resistance at least for today,"" said Jane Foley, senior
strategist at Rabobank. ""In the absence of a new wave of fears
concerning Spain, the euro looks to be dismissing the Portuguese
crisis as a sideshow.""
 The single currency has stayed supported by expectations the
European Central Bank will raise interest rates as early as
April, boosting its yield advantage over the dollar.
 The euro was flat at $1.4170, rebounding from lows on on
buying by Asian sovereign names. The euro could target a 4
1/2-month high of $1.4249 hit earlier in the week, and beyond
that $1.4283, a peak in early November.
 European leaders agreed on Thursday to increase their
financial rescue fund to the full 440 billion euros by June, but
avoided discussing Portugal, which is under growing pressure to
seek a bailout.
 A marked improvement in risk appetite and growing demand for
dollar-funded carry trades saw higher-yielding currencies gain.
 The higher-yielding Aussie flew to a 2011 high of $1.0255,
just shy of its 29-year peak of $1.0257. Traders cited stops
above $1.0260, with option expiries at $1.0200. Traders said
model funds were adding to long positions in the currency as
were real money accounts.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a currency basket, was up 0.1 percent at 75.836, not far above
75.340 hit earlier this week, its lowest since December 2009.
 
 JAPAN SEEN DEFENDING 80 YEN
 The dollar rose against the yen on reported demand from
macro funds with one trader also citing buying by Japanese
investors that helped the pair break through stops at 81.10 yen.
The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 81.24 yen, but any rise is
expected to be capped by reported offers at 81.30-45 yen, with
resistance also coming from the 21-day moving average at 81.39
yen. That was well above a record low of 76.25 yen hit last
week.
 Joint intervention by the Group of Seven industrialised
nations to sell the yen to contain its surge versus the dollar
and other currencies has stabilised the FX market.
 ""The relative stability of the yen since intervention will
please the Japanese authorities, and reduces the risk of further
intervention in the near term,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsibushi.
 ""We continue to believe that the Japanese authorities have
not set an explicit line in the sand, commonly perceived to be
around the 80 yen level, which would trigger intervention --
rather, it would require yen gains to accelerate markedly again
to prompt renewed intervention.""
 There is a possibility that the yen could gain in the coming
week as inflows ahead of the Japanese fiscal year-end on March
31 pick up. Japanese exporters usually sell the dollar ahead of
the financial year.

 * Lower import prices mean some firms helped by strong Sfr
 * Nearly half report negative effects from strong Sfr
 
 ZURICH, March 25 (Reuters) - Swiss companies feel more at
ease about the prospects for the Swiss economy though nearly
half are reporting ill effects from the strong franc, a report
by the Swiss National Bank showed.
 The information was compiled for the SNB's quarterly
assessment of March 2011, when it left its target for the
3-month Swiss franc LIBOR very low but raised its growth view
for the year to around 2 percent. 
 The SNB's quarterly report, issued on Friday, includes the
results of talks held in January and February with 243 company
representatives.
 When asked specifically about the impact of the rise of the
Swiss franc, which hit historic peaks against the euro and the
dollar in recent months, 47 percent said they had experienced
negative effects, a sign the situation has not changed since
late 2010.
 A total of 37 percent reported being unaffected by the
appreciation, while 16 percent said they had seen positive
effects. Manufacturing firms felt the most negative
effects, among them reduced profit margins and falling sales.
Tourism businesses were also hit.
 ""Overall uncertainty has declined. Business representatives
are mainly concerned about the erosion of margins, staff
shortages, a further appreciation in the Swiss franc and the
sharp increases in the prices of some commodities,"" the SNB
said.
 Firms benefitted from strong demand from European carmakers,
the SNB also said.
 ""With regard to the longer-term perspective, companies still
have reservations about the sustainability of the current
economic momentum, although their confidence has increased a
little,"" the SNB also said.
 The view offered by the companies largely reflects the
findings of the KOF economic barometer, which in February showed
the economy was set to pick up speed despite the strong
franc. [ID:nLDE71O0ZN]
 The SNB's rate target has been at rock bottom since March
2009 even though the Swiss economy has emerged relatively
unscathed from the global downturn. The SNB sees inflation
exceeding its price stability threshold of 2 percent in the
latter half of 2013.
 At its policy review on March 17, the SNB said concerns
about high levels of debts in some euro zone countries, which
could prompt more safe-haven buying of the Swiss franc, and high
oil prices were risks to the Swiss economy.
 In keeping with this view, chief concerns among businesses
were staff shortages, a further appreciation in the Swiss franc
and the sharp increases in the prices of some commodities, the
report said.
 ""As in previous quarters, some respondents expressed unease
about the continued low level of interest rates and the possible
risk of inflation,"" it also said.

 LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Moody's credit rating for
Portugal depends heavily on the country maintaining strong
commitment to consolidating its finances, the rating agency said
on Friday.
 Moody's maintains Portugal at A3, towards the lower end of
its investment grade ratings, with a negative outlook after
Prime Minister Jose Socrates lost a vote on fresh austerity
measures to tackle the country's debt crisis and resigned on
Wednesday.
 ""Strong commitment to fiscal consolidation by both leading
political parties is an important reason why the rating remains
within the A range,"" Moody's said in a statement.
 Rating agency Fitch downgraded Portugal to A- on Thursday,
on a par with the Moody's rating and four notches into
investment grade. However, Standard and Poor's cut Portugal on
Friday to BBB, two notches below the others, and warned of
further cuts.
 Portuguese borrowing costs on 10-year debt rose above 8
percent for the first time since the launch of the euro currency
in reaction to the downgrades.

 By Luke Baker and Noah Barkin
 BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - European leaders gave
themselves until June to finalise an increase in their temporary
bailout facility at a summit, failing to deliver the broad
package they had promised to resolve their debt crisis.
 Concern about Portugal, whose premier quit after austerity
measures aimed at avoiding a bailout were thrown out by its
parliament, dominated the meeting even if leaders chose not to
discuss it openly.
 The heads of government also extended the schedule for
paying into a permanent rescue fund to be set up from mid-2013,
giving themselves five years to provide capital of 80 billion
euros, rather than doing it over a shorter period in bigger
instalments.
 That was a concession to German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
who had balked at the previous funding plan for the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM) because it gave her less room to cut
taxes before the next federal election in 2013.
 European officials have said the fund will have a triple-A
rating despite the longer funding timetable.
 Having said for weeks that they would agree a ""comprehensive
package"" to tackle the euro zone debt crisis at the two-day
summit, the leaders were unable to finalise key decisions
because of political hurdles in some of its 27-member states.
 Although they agreed in principle earlier this month to
boost the lending capacity of their temporary safety net -- the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) -- to 440 billion
euros from roughly 250 billion, they had to push this back until
mid-year because of looming elections in Finland.
 Any agreement on debt relief for Ireland has also been
delayed pending the results of bank stress tests next week which
could show a sharp rise in losses at the country's stricken
financial institutions.
 Reflecting the threat investors see from Portugal, yields on
its 10-year benchmark bonds rose above 8 percent on Friday, a
rate that is considered unsustainable in the long term, making a
bailout more likely.
 The euro itself was little moved.
 President Anibal Cavaco Silva will meet the leaders of
Portugal's political parties on Friday to decide whether to call
a snap election.
 
 OPPOSES BAILOUT
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates is the second euro zone leader
to fall victim to the rolling sovereign debt crisis after
Ireland's prime minister was voted out of office last month.
 Attending the summit, Socrates made clear his continued
opposition to Portugal asking for a bailout, and said that
whatever Portuguese government comes to power after new
elections, it would stand by its deficit-cutting commitments.
If Portugal's president calls for new elections, by law they
cannot be held for a further two months. Any decision on whether
to seek a bailout may only therefore be taken in May. Portuguese
voters are opposed to any EU/IMF assistance.
 Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said he did
not expect Portugal to seek assistance from the EU rescue fund
any time soon.
 ""The situation in Portugal is very complicated. But nothing
suggests that Portugal will put in a request any time soon,"" he
told Deutschlandfunk radio.
 The fall of the government prompted both Standard & Poor's
and Fitch to cut Portugal's credit rating by two notches.
 The Portuguese upheaval underscored the wealth of political
obstacles the single currency bloc faces in trying to solve
a debt crisis that has deepened over the past year.
 As well as Portugal there are concerns about Ireland,
particularly its heavily indebted banks. Ireland has already
received an 85 billion euro bailout package, but there are
concerns it may need even more to recapitalise troubled lenders.
 Senior euro zone officials said Portugal was likely to need
60-80 billion euros in assistance from the EU rescue fund and
the International Monetary Fund.
 Lisbon needs to refinance about 4.5 billion euros of debt in
April and a similar amount in June, which may prove a trigger
for finally making the request for aid. One problem is that any
bailout request would have to be approved by parliament and the
majority is opposed to asking for help.
 With Portugal widely expected to seek assistance, attention
could soon shift to Spain, which has gradually won back the
confidence of investors in recent months by unveiling reforms of
the labour market and pension system, as well as a plan for
shoring up its ailing savings banks.
 In a sign that contagion worries remain, sources told
Reuters in Washington that the head of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) would seek approval from member countries
next week to activate a $580 billion crisis fund.
 ""The biggest worry is the high risk of contagion from
Portugal and general global uncertainty will trigger a new wave
of borrwing from the fund,"" one source said, noting that Spain
held one-third of Portugal's public debt.

 *Late spring may cut grain yield
 *Black Sea grain to return to the market
 
 By Pavel Polityuk and Aleksandras Budrys
 KIEV/MOSCOW, March 25 (Reuters) - Farmers in the leading
grain-producing areas of Ukraine and Russia will start mass
sowing in a few days and predict a rise in the 2011 grain
harvest and a return to the lucrative export market.
 But analysts and officials are now saying the increase may
not be as large as predicted a few months ago.
 A severe drought last summer left Russia without a third of
its 2010 grain harvest, while Ukraine lost about 15 percent of
grain crop compared to 2009.
 Russia, formerly among world's leading exporters of wheat,
banned grain sales for the 2010/11 season, while Ukraine, which
used to be the world's major exporter of barley and a leading
exporter of wheat and maize, imposed grain export quotas.
 A snowy winter without extreme frost across the region has
allowed Russian farmers to forecast a jump in the harvest to
about 86-87 million tonnes from 60.9 million in 2010, but poor
spring weather could cut the harvest to as low as 76 million.
 In Ukraine, which used to forecast a jump in grain
production to about 46 million tonnes this year from 39.2
million in 2010, the grain crop could rise to about 44 million
or even to 41 million if the spring appears to be dry.
 
 RUSSIA
 The Russian Grain Union, the top agrarian lobby, said it
expected overall grain harvest to reach 86 million tonnes this
year, up from 60.9 million tonnes in 2010, while a worst-case
scenario would result in a 76 million tonne crop.
 ""If we add up all the risks, the harvest could decline by
9.9 million tonnes from the expected plan,"" the union's
president Arkady Zlochevsky said.
 Zlochevsky said that weather-related risks included the
effect of late spring sowing, which has been delayed by about
three weeks due to cold weather, as well as another drought.
 A delay in sowing could lead to a fall in the harvest if the
best window of opportunity for the campaign is missed, which
could result in lower yields.
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkovin said earlier
this month that the government had lowered its forecast for this
year's grain crop to 84-85 million tonnes from a previously
expected 85-87 million.
 SovEcon analysts said earlier this week the crop could range
between 75-85 million tonnes this year.
 The bigger harvest will allow Russia, where grain
consumption totals 72-74 million tonnes, to return to export
markets later this year.
 The government has imposed a grain export ban to July 1,
following a devastating drought that wiped out one third of the
crop last summer.
 But Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik told journalists on
Friday that officials would consider lifting the grain export
ban after the size of this year's harvest is known in late
September or October.
 ""We will have to wait for the results of the spring sowing
and to have an understanding of the new crop,"" she said. ""We
will have that only at the end of September or October.""
 
 UKRAINE
 Ukraine, which had been forced to limit its grain shipments
after Russia's export ban, plans for an increase in the grain
harvest to 41-46.5 million tonnes this year, saying that weather
in April and May will be critical.
 ""Final results will depend on weather in April-May. A dry
April and May would mean that the harvest will not reach its
maximum possible level,"" a large foreign trader said.
 ""As of today, we forecast the harvest of about 46.5 million
tonnes, including 21 million of wheat,"" the trader said.
 Top Ukraine analyst UkrAgroConsult has been forecasting this
year's crop at 46.2 million tonnes but is likely to revise the
outlook lower.
 ""We are considering revising the forecast to about 44
million tonnes. Winter crops are not as perfect as we had
expected before,"" said Elizaveta Malysh from UkrAgroConsult.
 She said winter crops were better than a year ago but that a
delay in sowing could reduce the yield of spring grains.
 Less optimistic Ukrainian officials have said the harvest
could rise slightly to 41-42 million tonnes.
 The Farm Ministry predicted output of 42 million tonnes,
while Ukraine's Central Bank said in its macroeconomic report
that the crop could total 41 million tonnes this year.
 Ukraine consumes about 26 million tonnes of grain a year.

 (Updates with politicians' comments, PSD policy, ESM)
 By Axel Bugge and Shrikesh Laxmidas
 LISBON, March 25 (Reuters) - Portugal's president consulted
political leaders on Friday on whether to call a snap election
-- as most parties want -- after the Socialist prime minister
resigned.
 The crisis could force Portugal to request a bailout from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund after months
of desperate struggle to avoid one, becoming the third euro zone
country to seek aid, after Greece and Ireland.
 The crisis, which was sparked by parliament's rejection on
Wednesday of government austerity measures, prompted Standard &
Poor's and Fitch to downgrade Portugal's credit ratings.
 S&P's two-notch cut, which came with a warning it could
downgrade the debt-laden state further as soon as next week
depending on the final shape of the euro zone bailout fund, hit
the euro, although the currency later recovered. S&P now rates
Portugal lower than Ireland.
 European leaders on Thursday gave themselves until June to
finalise an increase in their temporary bailout facility,
failing to deliver the ""comprehensive package"" to resolve the
debt crisis they had promised for weeks.
 A sell-off in Portuguese bonds pushed the yield on its
10-year benchmark above 8 percent, a euro lifetime high and a
cost of funding that is widely viewed as unsustainable.
 The spread between Portuguese debt and safer German Bunds
widened 13 basis points to 474 basis points, while the cost of
insuring its debt against default also rose.
 President Anibal Cavaco Silva met first with the leaders of
the small Green Party and the Communists, who both left saying
they had recommended a snap election at the beginning of June.
 ""We think the best option is an election,"" said Communist
leader Jeronimo Sousa. ""We pointed to the start of June as a
possible time.""
 Cavaco Silva will meet with the main opposition Social
Democrats and the ruling Socialists late in the afternoon.
 
 SOCRATES AT EU SUMMIT
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates was attending a summit of
European Union leaders in Brussels on Friday. Concern about
Portugal dominated the meeting even if leaders chose not to
discuss it openly.
Socrates submitted his resignation to the president on
Wednesday after parliament rejected austerity measures proposed
by his minority Socialist government to try to avert a bailout.
The president must first hear the six parties represented in
parliament to see if there is a chance of a coalition cabinet
being formed. But analysts consider such an option unlikely
after the main opposition Social Democrats (PSD), who lead in
opinion polls, said they wanted an election.
 PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho said on Thursday he would
prefer the country to avoid a bailout and has committed himself
to meeting the budget deficit goals promised to Brussels. His
party has not said clearly how it plans to meet the budget goals
but has not ruled out raising value-added tax.
 Rating agency Moody's on Friday maintained Portugal's A3
grade with a negative outlook, citing ""strong commitment to
fiscal consolidation by both leading political parties"".
 ""Mixing political crisis with lack of an austerity package
and a bond market that is unwilling, that is not a situation
that can carry on for very long at all, so I think we're moving
towards the endgame where Portugal is forced to seek help,"" said
Robert Rennie, strategist at Westpac Bank.
 An opinion poll on Friday showed the PSD would win an
absolute majority if elections were held today.
 Cavaco Silva's next move will be to summon his Council of
State advisory body, after which he can dissolve parliament and
call an election, which by law cannot be held until late May.
His final decision is unlikely to come on Friday.
 Socrates will retain full powers until Cavaco Silva accepts
his resignation, which may not be until after the Council of
State meets. He is likely to stay on as a caretaker premier with
limited powers until a new government is formed.
 The Socialists' fall has left Portugal in limbo, with
legal experts guessing whether a caretaker government could ask
for an international rescue if needed. Portugal has a large
volume of debt maturing in the next few months.
 At the summit, Socrates made clear his continued opposition
to Portugal asking for a bailout, which has said would damage
the economy and mean more sacrifice for the Portuguese.
 Most economists agree Lisbon should be able to repay around
4.3 billion euros ($6.05 billion) of bonds falling due in April,
but 4.9 billion euros due in June may trigger a request for aid.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2011 06:40AM ET</span>","UPDATE 3-Vietnam raises parboiled rice sales, Thailand concerned"," * Vietnam's parboiled rice may meet 10 pct of global demand	
* Thailand to lose more market share	
* Bangladesh says buying from Thailand, Vietnam
(Adds Bangladesh deals)	
 By Ho Binh Minh	
 HANOI, March 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam aims to export 300,000
to 400,000 tonnes of parboiled rice this year, which could help
meet up to 10 percent of annual global demand for the variety
and hasten the pace of seizing market share from top exporter
Thailand.	
 The 5 percent broken parboiled rice was being sold at $490 a
tonne, above the $440-$450 for its 5 percent broken-rice grade,
bringing benefit to exporters and farmers, state-run Vietnam
Agriculture newspaper quoted industry officials as saying on
Friday. 
 Thai exporters were concerned as only parboiled rice can now
help support overall Thai rice exports because the nation has
already lost market share of white rice and fragrant rice sales
to Vietnam due to their high prices.	
 ""We may not feel the heat at this moment, but I think in the
longer term we could lose more market share to Vietnam,"" said
Chookiat Ophaswonges, honorary president of Thai Rice Exporters
Association.	
 At least a third of the targeted parboiled rice exports this
year could go to Bangladesh, which said on Friday it will buy
100,000 tonnes of the variety from Vietnam under a 200,000-tonne
government deal to be signed next week. 
 Bangladesh has also inked a deal to import 200,000 tonnes of
parboiled rice from Thailand at $580 a tonne, including cost and
freight, in its first government-to-government deal to secure
ample supplies of the staple. 
 Last year's shipments of parboiled rice from Vietnam, the
world's second-largest rice exporter, were not immediately
available, but traders said the volume was very small for the
rice variety that is still at a start-up phase in the country.	
 
 Q1 RICE EXPORTS UP	
 Vietnam's overall rice exports between January and March
will rise 17 percent from the same period last year to an
estimated 1.69 million tonnes, the government
said. 
 ""This year Vietnam is quickening parboiled rice sales, while
in the past there was only one plant supplying the rice in the
Mekong Delta,"" a trader in Ho Chi Minh City said.	
 From late 2010 several domestic companies began building
plants in the Mekong Delta to process parboiled rice and started
shipping this year.	
 They have exported more than 10,000 tonnes of parboiled rice
as of March 23, from 1,000 tonnes in the first 40 days of 2011,
Director Tran Ngoc Trung of Vinh Phat Investment Corp was quoted
by the newspaper, run by the Agriculture Ministry, as saying.	
 Vinh Phat planned to export 60,000 tonnes of parboiled rice
this year, Trung added.	
 The Ho Chi Minh City-based private firm has emerged this
year as Vietnam's top exporter of parboiled rice. Buyers of
parboiled rice -- a half-cooked variety that came to the market
a few decades ago to meet demand from Africa -- included
countries in Asia, the Middle East, Canada and Cuba, it said on
its web site (vinhphat.com).	
 Higher output will offer more relief to consumers of rice,
which has so far held well under the peaks of the 2008 food
crisis and below most other grains, amid fears over rising food
costs that have prompted rate hikes in most Asian countries
seeking to manage inflation. 
 
 
 THAILAND'S MARKET SHARE AT RISK	
 Vietnam's rising parboiled rice exports did not surprise
Thai exporters as they realised for a couple of years that
Vietnam will develop its technology to produce parboiled rice.	
 They said Thailand, currently the biggest exporter of
parboiled rice after India banned its rice exports, will lose
greater market share to Vietnam.	
 ""I'm serious that we could no longer be the world's top
exporter over the next 10 years if we let things go on like
this,"" a Thai exporter said. ""We used to be happy selling
premium-grade fragrant rice, but now it's not only us and our
market share is eroded.""	
 Traders in Thailand had said they were unlikely to supply a
big portion of the Philippines' rice needs in 2011 as Thai
prices were well above those in Vietnam. 
 Traditional buyers of Thai fragrant rice, with premium grade
of $920 a tonne, are now switching to Vietnam which offered the
variety at around $600 a tonne, traders said.

 * Credit Suisse sees 12 trln yen funding shortfall in
FY11/12
 * Watch for bank lending pickup to remove JGB market support

 By Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 25 (Reuters) - The Japanese government bond
market may finally be reaching a tipping point, with the
issuance needs for post-quake reconstruction prompting domestic
investors to demand higher yields to absorb yet more debt.	
 Abroad, Japan's massive and growing debt load has stirred
worries, driving the cost of default insurance to historic peaks
and prompting credit rating cuts to below Spain. At home,
benchmark yields have not budged much from near 1 percent.	
 In a country with public debt twice the size of its $5
trillion economy, many fund managers here are reluctant to talk
on the record about any fears about the bond market -- in part
because they have to justify holding bonds in their super
conservative portfolios. 
 But the direct damage from the March 11 quake and tsunami --
now seen as high as $310 billion, or about 6 percent of the
economy -- is raising some doubts about whether already
overloaded investors can absorb much more debt at such low
yields.	
 Big Japanese banks -- a key pillar of support -- may cut
back on JGB holdings for reconstruction lending, while insurers
may need to sell to raise funds to pay claims. Household
investors have traditionally shifted funds into higher-yielding
foreign assets and prefer JGBs only at yields well above current
levels.	
 ""Yields are not going to rise in the short term but it does
raise medium to long-term risks for the JGB market,"" Hidenori
Suezawa, chief strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.	
 Economists at Credit Suisse said the government may face a
12 trillion yen ($148 billion) funding shortfall in the fiscal
year beginning in April.	
 Even if the Ministry of Finance takes measures to limit the
increase in bond issuance, such as postponing planned corporate
tax cuts, Credit Suisse warned it may not be enough to prevent a
""significant deterioration"" in the JGB market.	
 
 Before the quake and ensuing crisis at a nuclear power
plant, the medium-term risks about bonds were being reflected in
the JGB market via a steep yield curve, with investors gradually
demanding a higher yield to hold long-term bonds relative to
short-term paper.	
 Since the quake, the yield curve between 5-year and 20-year
JGBs has steepened to 158 basis
points and is holding close to last year's decade high of 167
bps. 
 Benchmark 10-year yields even rose slightly
last week as the Nikkei share average plunged more than
10 percent, showing the need among insurers to sell. Yields are
now at 1.220 percent, 40 basis points above seven-year lows
touched last year.	
 Foreign players have gradually built up positions betting on
debt troubles for Japan via credit rating cuts.	
 The five-year credit default spread for JGBs
is now 95 bps, about 15 bps wider than pre-quake levels after
briefly hitting a record above 120 bps last week -- above the
spread of South Korea which has a lower credit rating.	
 Even Takahiro Mitani, chairman of Japan's $1.4 trillion
state pension fund, is aware of the risk. He told Reuters in a
February interview that Japan's debt could reach a ""critical""
point as early as 2016 unless it was tackled.	
 PIMCO warned earlier this year that there was little value
in longer dated JGBs around current yield levels.	
 
 CATALYST FOR RETHINK	
 Mitsubishi UFJ Securities estimates that, in a worst case
scenario, the impact on net government debt outstanding,
compared to where this would otherwise have been, could be as
much as 5-10 percent of GDP by 2014 as a result of the quake.	
 In other words, net government debt could rise to 150
percent of GDP in 2014 from around 130 percent in 2011.	
 ""There is... the possibility of the natural disaster proving
to be the catalyst to an investor rethink about the safety of
JGBs,"" Mitsubishi UFJ said in a note to clients.	
 The quake may also prompt household investors, who still
keep vast sums locked up in deposits yielding almost nothing, to
keep searching for better returns abroad.	
 ""Increased demand for foreign assets from Japan's private
sector and growing revulsion against large portfolio shares for
JGBs means first and foremost a weaker yen,"" it said.	
 In the coming years, rebuilding may help reflate the economy
and end deflation, dealing another blow to JGBs, even if the
fiscal effect can be mitigated by increased tax revenues.	
 One key to watch is the Japanese banks, which have lifted
their holdings of JGBs as a share of total assets to a record
high 18 percent and are one of the biggest regular buyers. A
rebound in lending means banks would inevitably hold fewer JGBs.	
 Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management,
says Japan's effort to grow more via stronger productivity and
lower corporate savings could have an adverse impact.	
 ""An irony of a decline in corporate savings without an
increase in government savings, is that while it might boost
nominal GDP, it might also result in some of the funding fears
that many have expressed for so long as it would make Japan more
vulnerable to foreign sentiment,"" he said.	
 ""In some ways, it seems like a lose-lose situation.""	
 In the very near term, banks and institutions may be tempted
to park their funds in the JGB market following the Bank of
Japan's cash injection that lifted current account deposits at
the central bank to a record above 41 trillion yen. 
 JGB auctions since the quake have drawn decent demand,
including a two-year and a 20-year auctions.	
 JGBs have managed to overcome various risks this year, the
biggest of which being the rating downgrades. Standard & Poor's
for example, now rates Japan one notch lower than Spain.	
 Domestic investors have largely shrugged off the warnings,
but more cuts may be on the way. 
 S&P said last week it was too early to judge the ratings
impact given the scale of the ongoing disaster, with uncertainty
from Japan's nuclear reactors and its future energy supply.	
 ""Given the sheer magnitude of the current disaster, the
rating on Japan could be affected if the debt burden were to
increase materially above our pre-earthquake expectations due to
a significant economic impact and reconstruction costs,"" said
Takahira Ogawa, S&P's Japan credit analyst.

 * Raises reserve requirements by 50-100 basis points
 * Says inflation expectations, risks to growth remain

(Adds detail, background, quote)
 MOSCOW, March 25 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank on Friday
raised its minimum reserve requirement but unexpectedly left key
interest rates unchanged, as it looks to steer a course between
high inflation expectations and risks to economic growth.
 The central bank left the overnight deposit rate -- seen as
its most effective tool in reducing rouble liquidity --
unchanged at 3.00 percent. 
 Most economists had expected a 25 basis-point hike.
 It increased minimum reserve requirements by 100 basis
points for liabilities for non-residents, and by 50 basis points
on all other liabilities.
 ""The central bank has surprised again. It is unlikely that
reserve requirements can be considered as a factor that can
stabilise inflationary risks,"" said Dmitry Polevoy at ING.
 ""Apparently, the central bank has decided to take a waiting
stance to see what will happen with inflation and macroeconomic
data in coming weeks,"" he added.
 The central bank said in a statement: ""The decision has been
made because of the continued expectations of high inflation and
risks to the economic growth.""
 It added that the instability on global financial and
commodity markets may have an impact on the Russian economy.
 ""The trend of macroeconomic indicators is ambiguous and they
have started to think that there are risks to the economy,"" said
Alexander Morozov, chief Russia economist at HSBC.
 ""By not raising rates, the central bank is taking a risk,
because inflation risks -- as they note themselves -- remain,
while given high oil prices there is a high chance that economic
growth will speed up in the near future.""
 The pace of inflation eased in the latest week, but consumer
prices have risen 3.6 percent since the start of the year,
making the official 2011 target of 6-7 percent inflation tough
to achieve.
 Friday's decision follows February's more aggressive
monetary tightening, when the central bank decided to raise key
interest rates as well as increasing reserves requirements.
 Most analysts polled by Reuters had expected that this time,
the central bank would kept the benchmark refinancing rate on
hold but would raise deposit rates as well hiking reserve
requirements.

 * Euro climbs after data shows dip less than expected
 * Broad picture of continuing strong economic recovery 
 
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, March 25 (Reuters) - German business confidence
eased only slightly in March, although the prospect of higher
interest rates and concern over the impact of Japan's earthquake
has given firms pause for thought, a survey showed on Friday.
 The closely-watched report by Munich's Ifo think tank on
Friday showed its business climate index, based on a monthly
survey of some 7,000 firms, inched down to 111.1, compared with
a forecast in a Reuters poll for a drop to 110.5.
 The euro ticked up in response as investors read the survey
as showing Germany's economic upturn was continuing unabated,
adding to the case for a first rise in euro zone interest rates
that may come as early as next month.
 Ifo said the survey's results were dented by its
forward-looking expectations component and the fact that half of
the survey's responses came in after the disaster at Japan's
Fukushima nuclear plant began to unfold.
 Analysts said there may be some worries about orders to and
from Japan in the near-term, although sales there are only a
tiny proportion of German exports and the concern was likely
chiefly about the broad impact on the global economy. 
 Ifo's expectations index fell to 106.5 from 107.9 in
February.
 ""The relatively slight fall is noticeably linked to Japan
and other uncertainty factors such as the situation in North
Africa or the Middle East,"" Ifo economist Klaus Abberger said.
 ""Japan will not have a lasting effect on the world economy.
Some companies have been affected and some supply chains have
broken down. But the global economy will not take an entirely
different course because of it.""

 RATE RISE
 Germany has recovered faster than expected from a recession
in 2009 that was its deepest since World War Two, and by the
fourth quarter of last year its economy was growing by 4 percent
year-on-year.
 That growth is at the heart of the case for a rise in
European Central Bank rates which would come at a time when
other euro zone member economies are struggling with a sovereign
debt crisis and slashing public spending in response.
 The prospect of a rise in the cost of companies' borrowing
fed into the slight worsening of sentiment, but Ifo economist
Klaus Abberger said German companies are well-placed to cope
with both higher rates and a higher oil price. 
 ""The shocks in Japan, North Africa/Mideast and the euro
crisis -- have been largely psychological,"" said Citigroup
economist Juergen Michels. ""The real effects on the German
economy appear to be limited so far.""
 Other data showed that lending to consumers and companies in
the euro zone picked up speed in February, with business
borrowing up 16 billion euros on the month.
 Germany's trade figures for January registered a slight
hiccup in exports but they also showed appetite for goods from
abroad grew more than expected, suggesting strong domestic
demand.
 Domestic demand also fuelled a stronger-than-expected rise
in German industrial orders in January, and output bounced back
from a plunge caused by icy winter weather late last year.
 ""Today's Ifo marginal drop is no reason to get petrified,""
said ING's Carsten Brzeski. ""The economy is slipping on oil but
is not tumbling. The fundamentals of the German economy are
strong enough to withstand some setbacks.""

 * Says China will help boost food security
 * Chinese expansion fuels territorial fears
 
 By Roman Kozhevnikov
BUSTONKALA, Tajikistan, March 25 (Reuters) - To some in
Tajikistan, Misha represents a better future. To others, he is
in the vanguard of the biggest imperial threat to Central Asia
since the Soviet Union collapsed.
 Misha, born Wang Shuai, is Chinese. His farming expertise is
helping villagers in an impoverished part of southern Tajikistan
to earn a living growing vegetables.
 The land he farms is also Chinese, temporarily at least,
under a landmark deal signed this month to lease 2,000 hectares
of Tajikistan to Beijing.
 The Tajik government has not released financial details of
the land lease terms. It says more such agreements are planned.
China says it has no territorial ambitions in Central Asia.
 ""China has no plans to garrison its people in foreign lands
in order to farm undeveloped land,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Jiang Yu said. ""Our increasing agricultural cooperation is based
on equality and mutual benefit.""
 Yet China's sheer size and its relentless hunger for raw
materials to feed its fast-growing economy mean its influence in
the vast mineral-rich region is growing fast. Governments in
Central Asia have accepted billions of dollars of Chinese loans
in exchange for access to natural resources.
 A quarter of Kazakhstan's oil production is Chinese-owned
and Beijing has built a pipeline to pump natural gas from the
world's fourth-largest reserves in Turkmenistan. In Tajikistan,
a Chinese company is majority owner of the largest gold mine.
 China's westward expansion across its 2,800-km (1,740-mile)
border with Central Asia has inflamed passions within the former
Soviet region, where opposition activists say governments are
giving up too many of their precious resources.
 ""This process is capable of stirring up tension within the
local population, who perhaps cannot accept such a mass influx
of Chinese,"" said Tajik political analyst Zafar Abdullayev.
 Tajikistan, where the average monthly wage is only $93, is
the poorest of the five former Soviet states in Central Asia.
Nearly 40 percent of its gross domestic product is derived from
remittances sent home by around 1 million migrant workers.
 
 FIRMS WIN CONTRACTS
 In the capital Dushanbe, Chinese firms have won contracts to
repair roads and construct the national library and new premises
for the Foreign Ministry.
 ""My husband works in Russia because he can't find work here,
while the government is bringing in Chinese to build our roads.
How can this be right?"" said Zarrina, 35, a Dushanbe resident.
 Around 6,000 Chinese citizens live in Tajikistan, mainly
engaged in building roads and tunnels in the mountainous
republic, where arable land is at a premium.
 After Russia, China is Tajikistan's biggest trade partner,
with an 18 percent share of the country's total trade turnover.
 Tajikistan also owes China $700 million, 36 percent of its
national debt. Loans from Beijing have been granted with a
20-year repayment period and 2 percent annual interest.
 Abdullayev said Tajik President Imomali Rakhmon, like other
Central Asian leaders, was using closer ties with Beijing for
leverage against ex-Soviet master Russia and Western countries
with an interest in the strategic region bordering Afghanistan.
 ""Beijing's support is now the main bargaining chip in
dialogue between Rakhmon's government and major world powers,""
the analyst said.
 Ties were reinforced this year when the two countries agreed
to end a century-old dispute over their border high in the Pamir
mountains, reaching an accord that evaded both Tsarist Russia
and the Soviet Union.
 While Tajikistan's Foreign Ministry heralded the deal to
cede only 4 percent of a disputed region the size of Albania as
a ""great victory"" for Tajik diplomacy, opponents accused the
government of surrendering sovereign territory.
 The Tajik government believes Chinese farming expertise will
improve productivity and revitalise the rural communities that
are home to three-quarters of the country's 7.5 million people.
 Safar Safarov, first deputy chairman of the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Tajikistan, said such projects would boost
food security in a country that imports 30 percent of its grain.
 ""It's practically impossible right now to find agricultural
produce from Tajikistan in our markets,"" he said. ""We need to
feed and water our own people.""
 Misha, like most Chinese settlers in former Soviet states,
has adopted a Russian name. He is the only Chinese citizen in
the village of Bustonkala, 100 km (63 miles) south of Dushanbe.
 His jet black T-shirt stretched at the collar, he grows
cucumbers and tomatoes inside four greenhouses. This year, he
will sow the village's first rice crop.
 ""I've learned a lot from him about farming, which is helping
me to grow a good crop,"" said Rustam Valiyev, a local engineer.
""This project has given us work and invaluable experience.""

 * Belarus must choose between devaluation, policy tightening
 * Forex controls could make matters worse
 * Minsk hasn't requested new IMF programme

(Writes through with full interview)
 By Douglas Busvine
 MOSCOW, March 25 (Reuters) - Belarus would be well advised
to devalue its currency to tackle unsustainable external
deficits resulting from excessively loose economic policy, the
International Monetary Fund said.
 It is not too late, however, to stabilise the economy of the
former Soviet state by cutting the budget deficit and hiking
interest rates, IMF Belarus mission chief Chris Jarvis told
Reuters.
 ""We do think a devaluation would be a good idea,"" Jarvis
said in a telephone interview late on Thursday.
 ""That said, a devaluation is not the only way that Belarus
could adjust. An alternative would be to impose tighter fiscal,
monetary, credit and wage policy.""
 Such a tightening would require the fiscal deficit to be
reduced below the 3 percent of gross domestic product penciled
into the 2011 budget.
 Interest rates would, meanwhile, have to be hiked so they
are ""positive, and in the short term strongly positive, in real
terms"". Belarus hiked rates by 200 basis points on March 11, to
12 percent, compared to inflation last year at 9.9 percent.
 ""At the moment, the authorities still have a choice between
those two policies. Time is getting short,"" Jarvis said.
 The IMF completed a lending programme with Belarus early
last year.
 
 MAKING MATTERS WORSE
 Rapid wage and lending growth in 2010, when Alexander
Lukashenko won a fourth term as president, has undermined the
competitiveness of Belarus's state-dominated economy, causing
the current-account deficit to widen to 15-16 percent of GDP.
 The Fund forecasts that the current account deficit -- a
broad measure of net trade flows -- will be 14 percent of GDP
this year, a level it sees as ""unsustainable"".
 The resulting depletion of foreign reserves has led the
central bank to curb hard currency purchases by households and
firms to prop up the Belarussian rouble .
 ""In general, exchange restrictions don't address the
underlying problem of loose policies -- and they could even make
matters worse,"" Jarvis cautioned.
 He declined to say how much Belarus should allow the rouble,
which now trades in a corridor run by the central bank, to
devalue. Bank analysts, including Tim Ash at RBS in London, have
speculated that the currency could fall by 20-30 percent.
 
 NO IMF LOAN SOUGHT
 Lukashenko, whose post-election crackdown on opposition
activists was criticised in the West last year, has tended to
rely on support from Moscow in the form of cheap energy
supplies. 
 Belarus is in talks with Russia to secure a $1 billion loan,
as well as a $1.7 billion credit from a bailout fund set up by
the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Community, officials have said.
 Minsk has not yet approached the IMF. ""We haven't received
any request from the authorities for a new programme,"" said
Jarvis.
 He declined to comment on whether controversy surrounding
the treatment of the opposition after December's election might
influence the willingness of the IMF to provide financial
assistance.
 Instead, he restated the position of the Fund's executive
board that any future lending deal ""should be accompanied by a
credible commitment to strong stability-oriented policies and an
ambitious structural reform agenda"".
 Jarvis also declined to comment on the risk of a sovereign
default by Belarus, after a ratings downgrade by Standard &
Poor's last week triggered a selloff in sovereign Eurobonds.
 He said the payment on Thursday of a coupon on a bond issued
in Russia last year ""should be a reassuring sign to investors"".
 ""Government officials have told us that they are giving
priority to servicing debt,"" he said.

 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - World stocks edged higher on
Friday, focusing on a buoyant economic and company backdrop,
while the euro shrugged off ratings downgrades for Portugal,
which is in the grip of a political and debt crisis.
 Europe's single currency wobbled after Standard & Poor's
followed Fitch in cutting Lisbon's credit rating by two notches.
But it soon found its feet.
 ""The market is treating many of these downgrades as
rearguard actions which are already well discounted,"" said Todd
Elmer, currency strategist at Citi in Singapore.
 The euro also got a nudge higher after the closely-watched
Ifo survey showed German business sentiment fell less than
expected, holding at strong levels.
 President Anibal Cavaco Silva will meet the leaders of
Portugal's political parties on Friday to decide whether to call
a snap election following the prime minister's resignation after
his latest austerity measures, aimed at avoiding a bailout, were
thrown out by parliament.
 Portugal's borrowing costs could not escape the fallout.
 The yield on 10-year Portuguese government bonds rose to a
new euro-era high above 8 percent, well above the level which
the government says is sustainable, and the premium to hold its
10-year debt rather than Germany's widened to 474 basis points.
 The cost of insuring Portuguese government debt against
default also rose.
 Stock markets have remained buoyant despite Japan's
catastrophes, turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa and
the euro zone debt crisis roaring back into life.
 Wall Street looked set for a higher start, with futures for
the S&P 500 up 0.4 percent and Dow Jones futures up 0.3 percent.
 The MSCI All-Country index was up 0.1 percent at 340.1 and
is higher than when Japan's earthquake and tsunami struck.
 European shares were also marginally up as bullish
macroeconomic and company signals vied for attention with the
euro zone debt problems and violence in Libya.
 Even emerging market stocks, which tumbled at the start of
the year, are at eight-week highs and close to getting into the

 * Photos show them struggling in the dark to control
reactors

 By Elaine Lies	
 March 25 (Reuters) - Radiation injuries to three workers at
Japan's stricken nuclear plant have put a focus once again on
the unnamed and largely faceless corps of men risking their
lives to prevent further catastrophe for their countrymen. 
 First dubbed the ""Fukushima Fifty"", their number has now
risen to more than 700 workers toiling inside an evacuation zone
at the facility on Japan's northeast coast that was battered on
March 11 by an earthquake and then a tsunami.	
 Feted by foreign media and on social networks, the men have
also won quieter admiration and sympathy from Japanese.	
 ""Their job was in that sort of workplace, and I think they
always knew that this might be their destiny, that at some point
they might have to fight this kind of thing,"" said Yasuchika
Honda, a 27-year-old advertising executive in Tokyo.	
 ""They're trying very hard and I'm very grateful.""	
 Three workers replacing a cable at the plant, run by Tokyo
Electric Power Co (TEPCO) , were exposed to radiation
10,000 times higher than expected when they stood in
contaminated water this week. 
 Though encased in protective suits, it turned out two of the
men had boots too short to stop water seeping in.	
 In a rare glimpse into conditions inside the reactors,
photos released two weeks into the crisis showed shadowy figures
working in near-darkness to restore the power and cooling
systems, the gloom illuminated by a few weak lights.	
 ""They're all the real Samurai,"" said one admirer on a
Facebook page dedicated to the Fukushima workers and mainly
containing messages from outside Japan. 
 ""Let us pray for your healthy and safe return to your homes.
May God help all of you in each single minute when you are still
fighting desperately for your country and people. Thank you,
Fukushima 50,"" commented another person on Facebook.	
 
 ""LIKE A WAR""	
 The only public appearance by anyone who has been inside the
plant was a news conference by firefighters earlier this week.
They cried with relief and spoke of their commitment to duty.	
 Most of the workers are too busy to go home. 
 The wife of one told the daily Yomiuri Shimbun that she had
not seen her husband since the day of the quake and tsunami, and
had only spoken with him briefly several times.	
 ""It's like a war here,"" she quoted him as saying. Asked if
he had been exposed to radiation, he told her: ""A little.""	
 The lack of effusive praise or public fuss over them inside
Japan may be due to cultural norms that emphasize the group over
individuals. 
 Sociology professor Takashi Miyajima, of Hosei University
near Tokyo, said praise in Japan was generally reserved for the
whole team -- and only when they finally succeed. 
 Reservations about the role of plant operator TEPCO could
also be a factor.	
 ""Among the mainstream media there's also a growing sense of
how responsible TEPCO is for this whole mess, and this is making
them reluctant to praise anybody involved in cleaning it up,""
Miyajima said.	
 ""After all, these workers are mainly TEPCO people or from
TEPCO affiliates.""	
 Foreign media have reported the Twitter comments by one of
the men's daughters who said he had volunteered despite being
just six months from retirement. 
 ""My eyes are filling up with tears,"" posted @NamicoAoto. 
 ""At home, he doesn't seem like someone who could handle big
jobs...but today, I was really proud of him. And I pray for his
safe return.""

 * Says developing economies face inflation, asset bubbles
 * Says downside risks for gold can't be overlooked
(Adds quotes)	
 BEIJING, March 25 (Reuters) - Loose monetary policies in
developed economies will place more upward pressure on global
commodity prices and weigh on the dollar this year, the Chinese
central bank said on Friday.	
 In a report reviewing the performance of global financial
markets, the People's Bank of China also warned of a deepening
of the European debt crisis, though its broad view was coloured
with optimism.	
 ""We expect that the world economy will keep recovering, and
the foundation for the recovery will be firmer,"" it said in the
125-page report.	
 In a brief discussion of risks, it pointed to Europe's debt
woes as well as inflation and the potential for asset bubbles in
developing markets.	
 On balance, however, it said that the dollar would fare
worse than the euro.	
 ""In 2011, the dollar will be on a downward trend overall,
because of the slow recovery of its economy, low interest rates
and twin deficits,"" the central bank said. ""The possible
spreading of European sovereign debt crisis and geopolitical
risks may push up the dollar in some periods.""	
 It noted that short-term interest rates in major economies
would gradually rise as their recovery solidifies.	
 ""But as the global recovery momentum is not strong, the
increases will not be too large,"" it said.	
 Looking at global commodities, it said that wealthy nations
were printing money to kick-start their economies and this would
inevitable push up prices.	
 ""Developed countries will continue with their loose policies
and global liquidity will remain ample, which will keep prices
of commodities, especially crude oil and grains at high levels,""
it said.	
 Concerns about inflation would trigger demand for gold as a
store of value, but the precious metal's bull run may be near
its end, it added.	
 ""We need to note that gold prices have reached historical
highs, and its downward risks should not be overlooked,"" the
central bank said.	
 It said the global recovery depended in large part on
coordination between major economies.	
 ""All countries should avoid competitive devaluation of their
currencies and pay more attention to risks brought by
excessively loose policies on the back of a global recovery,"" it
said.	
 The central bank reiterated that China would make its
currency more convertible under the capital account, a
long-standing pledge that has resulted in only incremental
progress so far.	
 ""We will relax restrictions on cross-border capital
transaction activities in a selective and step-by-step manner,
making sure that all risks are effectively under control,"" it
said.

 * Probe centres on 100,000 tonne cargo of ""power kerosene""
 * China taxes diesel, jet kerosene; power kerosene exempt

(Adds additional Glencore statement in para 2)
 By Aizhu Chen
 BEIJING, March 25 (Reuters) - China's customs authorities
detained a Glencore trader as part of an probe into the
potential evasion of millions of dollars in taxes on fuel
imports, sources with direct knowledge of the situation said.
 Glencore said on Friday it had done nothing wrong and did
not know why its employee had been arrested, since it sold the
fuel before it reached China.
 Chinese customs authorities have since late last year been
looking into imports of ""power kerosene"", a fuel of a quality
between diesel and kerosene that can easily be turned into
diesel, but is not subject to a hefty consumption tax which
otherwise applies to diesel or kerosene.
 China levies a consumption tax of about $125 per tonne on
imports of diesel or jet kerosene, but power kerosene is exempt.
 Li Buhua, a Chinese national who is a member of Glencore's
Beijing-based trading team, was detained by local customs
authorities and released last week on bail, sources with direct
knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
 Glencore confirmed an employee had been detained but did not
identify him. It said it sold 120,000 tonnes of mixed kerosene
and power kerosene, which was stored at a Singapore ""tank farm"".
The customer, Guangdong Zhenrong Energy, took the cargo away in
four ships over a period of about two months.
 ""We had no economic interest in these cargoes after they
left Singapore. We deny any wrongoing,"" a Glencore spokesman
said, adding that the sales were done on a ""free-on-board""
basis, meaning the ownership of the cargo switched to the
customer at Singapore.
 ""It's not clear to us why our field officer was arrested. We
presume it was to help the authorities,"" the spokesman added.
 Officials at Zhenrong's Beijing headquarters were not
immediately available for comment.
 The investigation involves a 100,000-tonne cargo Glencore
brought in through China's Zhuhai customs port late last year,
said the sources. On those figures, the shipment would be worth
around $80 million and value of the tax would be about $12.5
million.
 ""It's still being investigated. There is no conclusion yet,""
said a trader with direct knowledge of the situation.
 ""Glencore is only one of the suppliers,"" the trader added.
 The Swiss commodity trading giant, valued earlier this year
by one analyst at about $60 billion, is preparing for what could
be a record London initial public offering (IPO). Bankers said
the investigation would have no impact on the share sale.
 All five sources declined to be identified because of the
sensitivity of the case.
 
 POWER KEROSENE BOOM
 The customs authorities also detained another trader from
chemical firm Kolmar and that trader was also released on bail,
sources familiar with the situation said.
 Nobody at Kolmar was immediately available for comment. A
spokesman with China's General Administration of Customs said he
could not comment immediately and would check with relevant
departments.
 Mostly sourced from Asia oil hub Singapore, oil major BP
and one or two Western trading houses were among the suppliers
of power kerosene, traders told Reuters last year.
 The power kerosene boom helped push overall kerosene imports
to a record 861,000 tonnes in November. That coincided with a
shortage of diesel in China, the result of a crackdown on coal
use which spurred many power users to switch to stand-alone
diesel generators. 
 The fuel was treated by regional customs departments as
neither diesel nor aviation fuel, traders said.
 ""It has a potential legal risk because of the tax issue
involved,"" one Beijing-based senior trader said in December.
""But you can't really blame these suppliers as China's diesel
shortage forced traders to become more creative.""
 The customs authorities started to probe the trades after
Sinopec Corp, the country's largest refiner, complained to the
authorities about the exotic oil flows.
 Traders said it was not clear why these companies were
singld out as other sellers were involved in similar trades.
 ""The companies involved collaborated with Chinese officials
and swapped around the names of the import goods, taking
advantage of loopholes in Chinese customs regulations,"" Chinese
paper The 21 Century Business herald reported the case on
Thursday, citing one source with knowledge of the case.
 China's overall kerosene imports are traditionally dominated
by jet kerosene, the grade used for aviation fuel. But late in
2010 imports of other grades suddenly took off, peaking in
December when the volume even surpassed that of jet fuel.
 Since then kerosene imports appear to have returned to
normal, according to data from China's Customs office. The trade
in power kerosene may also have thinned out because the rush to
import the fuel pushed prices up to more than the cost of
diesel.
 Global commodities companies have run into trouble with
Chinese authorities in the past.
 In a more serious case, Rio Tinto's former chief iron ore
salesman in China, Stern Hu, was last year jailed for 10 years
for accepting bribes and stealing state secrets. Hu's three
Chinese colleagues were also jailed.

 By Ho Binh Minh	
 HANOI, March 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam's March coffee exports
rose an estimated 22 percent from the same month last year to
150,000 tonnes, or 2.5 million bags, exceeding market
expectations and offering relief over delivery shortages.	
 Coffee shipments in February were revised up to 144,000
tonnes, or 2.4 million 60-kg bags, up 87 percent from the same
month in 2010, the General Statistics Office said on Friday. It
previously estimated loading of 90,000 tonnes for February.	
 The office also revised up sharply coffee exports in January
to 215,500 tonnes from a revision last month of 145,000 tonnes.
It gave no explanation for the increase.	
 Coffee exports between October 2010 and March 2011, the
first half of the 2010/2011 crop year, would reach an estimated
13.32 million bags, the office said, up 28.4 percent from the
corresponding period a year ago.	
 Rising exports from Vietnam could help ease concern about a
possible shortage of available supplies to deliver against
London's May robusta contract , which was behind a rise
in the futures market on Thursday. 
 Traders have earlier forecast coffee exports this month from
Vietnam, the world's top robusta producer, at between
110,000-130,000 tonnes. 
 The coffee crop year lasts between October and September.	
 The government estimated January-March's coffee export
revenues soared 115 percent from a year ago to $1.05 billion, or
an average of $2,061 per tonne, up 47.3 percent from $1,399 a
tonne in the same period last year.	
 Coffee is the country's second-largest agro-product export
item in terms of value, after rice.	
 Vietnam may still have 5.85 million bags left in the
country, based on a median forecast of the 2010/2011 crop output
at 19.75 million tonnes in a Reuters poll on March 1
.	
 The International Coffee Organization estimated local
consumption at 1.58 million bags, while 1.0 million bags had
been carried from the previous 2009/2010 crop.	
 It was not clear how much of the 5.85 million bags would be
available for sales, but the estimated stock is below the 7.33
million tonnes left at the end of March 2010 .

 * Industry hit as it was recovering from global crisis

 By Chang-Ran Kim	
 TOKYO, March 25 (Reuters) - Lost production in the two weeks
since an earthquake and tsunami struck northeast Japan tops a
third of a million vehicles, and it could be months, rather than
weeks, before the country's automakers get back on
track.	
 Modern-day cars have as many as 30,000 parts, 70-80 percent
of which are supplied by hundreds of component makers. A single
missing bolt can halt assembly lines and set off a chain
reaction in the industry's famed just-in-time manufacturing
process.	
 With some 500 parts firms affected in the quake and
tsunami-devastated northeast, cutting off supply of electronic
parts, resin-based products and more, Japan's auto industry is
especially vulnerable to a ruptured supply chain.	
 ""We're in a stage where we can only hope for an
incremental improvement,"" said Deutsche Securities auto analyst
Kurt Sanger, who predicted a return to normal operations would
take months.	
 ""'Normal' is a long way away,"" the Tokyo-based analyst said.	
 
 Before the disaster, Japan's $700 billion autos
industry was just returning to a mild recovery track following a
brutal financial crisis that battered car sales worldwide.
Manufacturers were cutting costs and also ramping up overseas
production to weather a strong yen.	
 The March 11 quake damaged a factory of Renesas Electronics
Corp , a leading supplier of automotive micro control
units. Close to a fifth of global auto production relies on
products from its Naka factory, in Ibaraki prefecture, Deutsche
Securities estimates.	
 When a 2007 earthquake damaged a plant at Riken Corp
, Japan's top supplier of piston rings, all 12 Japanese
car and truck makers were forced into a 3-day shutdown.	
 In a worst-case scenario, global vehicle output could slump
30 percent within six weeks because of the shortage of auto
parts stemming from the Japan quake, research firm IHS
Automotive has warned. 
 "" It's a completely unprecedented situation,"" said
UBS auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida.	
 
 RUNNING ON EMPTY	
 Japan's car makers are still building vehicles overseas with
whatever stocks they have, but those will soon run out. Toyota
Motor Corp this week notified workers and dealers in
North America that output there could slow. 
 At home, the industry has ground to a virtual halt since the
earthquake, and automakers including Toyota, Nissan Motor Co
and Honda Motor Co have been left to issue
almost daily updates on their production plans.	
 With earnings certain to take a hit and Japanese transport
sector stocks slumping 11 percent since the disaster,
automakers are reluctant to forecast how long the stoppages
could last, saying only that a near-term solution is elusive.	
 ""It's very, very difficult to predict when we will be able
to restart production,"" said Nissan spokesman Toshitake
Inoshita.	
 Some replacement parts and components for vehicles built
overseas are being made, but stocks are running low.	
 Added to that, automakers face rolling power blackouts, a
shortage of fuel to truck goods, and a nuclear crisis that has
put some suppliers near the damaged Fukushima complex
off-limits, such as Nissan's engine factory in Iwaki, Tochigi.	
 The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association has set up a
procurement committee to centralise information on parts
suppliers, and reduce any duplication of effort.	
 That may help speed up information-gathering, but won't
rebuild damaged factories or deliver substitute parts, analysts
said.	
 ""Normalising operations requires not only repairs at the
vehicle assembly plants, but also the restoration of facilities
at a wide range of parts suppliers, public service companies,
and distributors,"" Yoshida of UBS said.

 By Gyles Beckford and Georgina Prodhan
 SYDNEY/LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Hundreds of customers
queued outside Apple stores in Asia and Europe to buy an iPad 2
tablet computer amid fears that shortages in the United States
would be repeated abroad.
 The iPad 2, a thinner and faster version that features two
cameras for video chat, was introduced in the United States on
March 11, and analysts estimate about a million were sold in the
first weekend. Prices start at $499.
 On Friday, the rollout was extended to 25 countries
including most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and
Mexico. The Japanese launch is delayed, but Apple says component
shortages resulting from the earthquake there are not to blame.
 Some non-Apple outlets in New Zealand and London said they
had only been allocated a dozen iPads apiece. A source at one UK
retail chain guessed the reason was likely a desire on Apple's
part to be seen to sell out rather than any shortage of parts.
 Apple shares were up 1.9 percent at $351.60 by 1611 GMT,
when the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.9 percent.
 Canadian backpacker Alex Lee, a veteran of Apple product
launches, was the first to claim his iPad 2 at the Apple store
in Sydney where he had been in line for two nights.
 ""If it wasn't for the iPad, I wouldn't be in Australia right
now,"" said Lee, who had already bought an iPad 2 in the United
States. ""It's like a habit. I've also lined up on Regent Street
in London for the iPhone.""
 In London, 32-year-old financial adviser Jewels Lewis was at
the head of the queue at Apple's Regent Street store, after
being fourth in line for the original iPad a year ago. He had
been waiting since 0730 on Thursday for the 1700 Friday sale.
 ""It's quite nice just to take the time out, chill out,
reflect,"" said Lewis, enjoying the morning sunshine from his
folding chair at the head of a queue of about 200 people.
 In Frankfurt, Germany, about 80 people were waiting outside
the Apple store. A few had been there since Thursday night but
most gathered on Friday morning.
 Thorsten Schumann, aged 30, summed up the instant attraction
that many consumers feel for Apple products. ""I was in the
States and I held an iPad 2 in my hand, and now I want to have
one,"" he said.
 In Nokia's homeland Finland, where Apple has made less of an
impression than in many other markets and has no flagship
stores, no queues were to be seen outside reseller outlets in
below-freezing temperatures.
 In Asia, the iPad 2 will be officially available in Hong
Kong, South Korea, Singapore and other countries in April. In
Hong Kong, iPads purchased in the United States are already on
sale for hefty mark-ups.
 Official prices for the iPad are cheapest in the United
States and most expensive in Denmark.
 
 IPADS FOR EVERYONE
 The first iPad, which went on sale a year ago, sold 500,000
units in the first week and crossed the 1 million unit mark in
28 days. Nearly 15 million iPads were sold in nine months of
2010, two or three times as many as analysts had predicted.
 Analysts expect the company to sell 30 million or more this
year, generating close to $20 billion in sales, even as other
companies launch their own devices.
 Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs said on Tuesday the company
was ""working hard to build enough iPads for everyone"" as the
company struggled to meet U.S. demand.
 Apple's clout in the supply chain means investors remain
confident -- for now -- that it enjoys priority and can secure
critical components ahead of competing manufacturers.
 Waiting time for delivery of online iPad orders has
shortened to three to four weeks from as much as six to seven
weeks a few days ago.
 Still, Apple is unlikely to avoid a hit from the disruption
in Japan, analysts say.
 ""We think the disruption especially for chemical materials
could continue throughout Q2 and when the components become
absent, it's inevitable that Apple would be affected,"" said
Calvin Huang, an analyst at Daiwa in Hong Kong.
 ""Then we will see a situation that customers will have to
wait for months for an iPad to arrive after placing an order.""
 Several key components in the new version of the iPad 2 come
from Japan, including the battery and the flash memory used to
store music and video on the device, according to technology
research firm IHS iSuppli.
 Delays have been relatively harmless to Apple while it
enjoyed a near-monopoly in the tablet market it created with the
original iPad last year, but rivals are rushing to market with
their own offerings to cash in on the trend.
 Samsung Electronics and Motorola have tablets on the market
and Blackberry-maker Research In Motion and Hewlett-Packard Co
will release theirs in coming months.
 RIM, which has been losing ground to Apple and to Google's
Android, warned on Thursday that its earnings would slip as it
spends heavily on the launch of its PlayBook tablet, which is
due to go on sale next month.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Masayuki Kitano
 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, March 25 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered
near a 15-month low against a basket of currencies and was in
sight of a 29-year trough against the Australian dollar as a
bounce in equities suggested that risk appetite was on the mend.
 The euro dipped briefly after Standard & Poor's downgraded
Portugal's credit ratings by two notches to BBB and warned it
could cut it again by one notch as early as next week.
[ID:nL3E7EO3OJ]
 But the single currency's losses were limited, and the
broader picture was one of dollar weakness on the back of a
recovery in global equities and improving risk sentiment.
 ""The market is treating many of these downgrades as
rear-guard action which is already well discounted and the
dollar is under pressure broadly,"" said Todd Elmer, currency
strategist at Citi in Singapore.
 ""This will continue to support the euro even if we do see
some marginal negative news on the sovereign debt crisis.""
 The euro  traded around $1.4180, up slightly from late
U.S. trade. It stumbled as low as $1.4150 after the downgrade,
but bids around that level and $1.4140 clipped further losses.
 The single currency has rebounded from a slide to around
$1.4050 on Thursday. Traders suspected Asian sovereign names had
been buying the euro around that level.
 This put back into view a 4 1/2-month high of $1.4249 hit
earlier in the week, and analysts including Elmer at Citi
expected the euro to soon retest that level, and subsequently
$1.4283, a peak hit in early November.
 The euro has shown resilience despite worries over the
fiscal woes of highly-indebted euro zone countries such as
Portugal, supported in part by market expectations that the
European Central Bank would raise interest rates as early as
April, boosting its yield advantage over the dollar.
 In another sign of the dollar's broad weakness, the
Australian dollar hovered near its Dec. 31 peak around $1.0257
-- a level not seen since 1982. The Aussie dollar last stood at
$1.0200, down a touch from Thursday. 
 ""With U.S. equities rising on solid earnings it looks as if
risk appetite improving,"" said a trader for a major Japanese
bank in Tokyo.
 JAPAN SEEN DEFENDING 80 YEN
 Markets have settled after Japanese equities plunged last
week on worries over the economic toll from Japan's earthquake
and tsunami, while fears over a quake-crippled nuclear power
plant had spurred a bout of risk aversion.
 Joint intervention by the Group of Seven industrialised
nations to sell the yen to contain its surge versus the dollar
and other currencies has stabilised the FX market. 
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 80.99 yen ,
staying some ways above a record low of 76.25 yen hit last week.
 Investors are bracing for the possibility of more
yen-selling intervention by Japan, while dollar selling interest
by Japanese exporters ahead of the financial year-end is likely
to temper gains in the U.S. currency.
 Traders in Hong Kong cited slight dollar demand at 80.90 and
81.00 yen, while adding that selling demand was limited in Asian
trade. A trader for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo said there
were dollar offers at levels above 81.50 yen.
 Market participants see Japan defending the dollar around 80
yen through the fiscal year-end, while analysts say it will step
in to curb yen strength around that level beyond March if any
yen appreciation is accompanied by erratic market movements.
 Japan has said the aim of any intervention is to quell
market volatility. Last week's action achieved this, as the
dollar has been glued to the 81 yen region throughout this week
while implied volatility has dropped sharply .
 ""The fact that the market has calmed gives them less need to
intervene, but there's a good chance that if the dollar went
below 80 yen, market volatility would pick up quite
significantly, so they would be justified in entering the
market,"" said David Forrester, currency strategist at Barclays
Capital in Singapore.
 He added that even an orderly break below 80 yen could
prompt Tokyo authorities could step as a preemptive move to
avoid any jump in volatility.
 Other analysts argued that last-minute yen buying by
corporates has ended while significant repatriation flows by big
Japanese investors have been more or less nonexistant in the
past week, suggesting few immediate reasons to buy the yen.
 As a result, Koji Fukaya, currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in Tokyo, said further yen strength would be unwarranted,
likely prompting Japan and other countries to enter the market.
 ""Regardless of when it happens, I think a break under 80 yen
will see coordinated intervention,"" said Koji Fukaya, currency
strategist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.
 ""And the threat is of coordinated action, rather than Japan
acting on its own, so I don't see a break under that level.""
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a currency basket, was flat at 75.711 <.DXY>, but hovered near
75.340 hit earlier this week, its lowest since December 2009.
 The index looks vulnerable on charts after its recent drop
below trendline support connecting lows hit in July 2008 and
November 2010. One possible target is its 2009 low of 74.170.
 A trader at another Japanese bank in Tokyo said the 75 level
is now seen as major support for the dollar index. A breach of
that level could open way for further fall in dollar, he added.

 * Concerns about supply of popular device remain
 * Unclear how Japan supply constraints will impact
availability

 WELLINGTON/SYDNEY, March 25 (Reuters) - Hundreds of
customers lined up outside Apple stores in Australia
and New Zealand on Friday for the international launch of the
iPad 2, which has flown off the shelves in the United States
leaving the company struggling to meet demand.	
 Analysts forecast some 1 million devices may have been sold
in the first weekend of the launch in the United States, but
many warn that it's not clear how supply constraints will affect
availability following the Japan earthquake and tsunami.	
 Apple plans to roll out the new iPad on Friday to 25 markets
including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Germany,
Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, and Spain.	
 The iPad 2, a thinner and faster version that features two
cameras for video chat, was introduced in the United States on
March 11. But some would-be buyers have expressed frustration at
how difficult it has been to secure one of the wildly popular
tablet computers, sparking speculation Apple misjudged demand.	
 ""If it wasn't for the iPad, I wouldn't be in Australia right
now,"" said Alex Lee, a backpacker from Canada, who was the first
in the queue outside the glass-fronted Apple store in Sydney's
central business district. He said he diverted his travels from
Singapore to attend the launch.	
 ""It's like a habit. I've also lined up on Regent Street in
London for the iPhone"", added Lee, who had a folding chair and
blanket and had spent two nights waiting.	
 
 
 
 Blue-shirted Apple staff in Sydney handed out trays of
sandwiches to those in the queue, some of whom had bedded down
on blankets overnight before being awoken by bright sunshine.	
 The iPad 2 goes on sale at 5 p.m. local time (0400) GMT in
New Zealand and at 0600 GMT on the east coast of Australia,
before sales kick off in other markets.	
 Its retail price in Australia starts at A$579 ($568),
against $499 in the United States.	
 Chief Executive Steve Jobs said in a statement on Tuesday
the company was ""experiencing amazing demand for iPad 2 in the
U.S."" and added ""We appreciate everyone's patience and we are
working hard to build enough iPads for everyone.""	
 Fiona Martin, a spokeswoman for Apple in Australia, declined
to comment on whether there was enough stock to meet demand.	
 ""We don't comment on speculation, we've got plenty down
there for all those folk that are in the queue.""	
 In New Zealand, a shop assistant at JB HiFi , one of
Wellington's major electronic shops, said there had been a
constant stream of people asking about the iPad.	
 ""We haven't even seen it, we don't know how many we're
getting, but there'll be big demand you can bet,"" said the
assistant.	
 A prospective buyer, 22-year-old student Ian MacDonald,
said he had held off buying the first generation iPad because it
lacked a camera and he wanted any bugs ironed out.	
 ""This version looks way better, with the cameras and it
beats all the other tablets because there are so many apps
(applications),"" he said.	
 In addition to Friday's rollout, Apple said the iPad 2 will
be available in Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and additional
countries in April.	
 
 JAPAN SUPPLY CONCERNS	
 Analysts are concerned that Apple will face shortages of key
components for the iPad 2 because of the earthquake and tsunami
that struck Japan two weeks ago.	
 Several key components in the new version of Apple's popular
iPad come from Japan, including the battery and the flash memory
used to store music and video on the device, according to IT
research house iSuppli . 
Apple delayed sales of the iPad 2 in Japan, but has said that
had nothing to do with any component shortages.	
 ""We expect Apple to face increased pressure in meeting iPad
2 and iPhone 4 demand in the second quarter,"" Stifel Nicolaus
analyst Doug Reid wrote recently. ""Although it is early to gauge
the extent of component supply shortages, we see risk to our
iPad and iPhone unit estimates in the June quarter.""	
 That said, the wait time on delivery of online orders has
shortened to 3-4 weeks in recent days from as high as 6-7 weeks,
suggesting component shortages have not reached critical levels.	
 The iPad two also faces increased competition. Samsung
Electronics and Motorola have tablets on the market
and Blackberry-maker Research In Motion and
Hewlett-Packard Co are set to release tablets in coming
months.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Masayuki Kitano
 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, March 25 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered
near a 15-month low against a basket of currencies and was in
sight of a 29-year trough against the Australian dollar as a
bounce in equities suggested that risk appetite was on the mend.
 The euro dipped briefly after Standard & Poor's downgraded
Portugal's credit ratings by two notches to BBB and warned it
could cut it again by one notch as early as next week.
[ID:nL3E7EO3OJ]
 But the single currency's losses were limited, and the
broader picture was one of dollar weakness on the back of a
recovery in global equities over the past week and improving
risk sentiment.
 ""The market is treating many of these downgrades as
rear-guard action which are already well discounted and the
dollar is under pressure broadly,"" said Todd Elmer, currency
strategist at Citi in Singapore.
 ""This will continue to support the euro even if we do see
some marginal negative news on the sovereign debt crisis,"" he
said, adding that he saw the euro retesting its recent highs in
the near term.
 The euro has shown resilience despite worries over the
fiscal woes of highly-indebted euro zone countries such as
Portugal, supported in part by market expectations that the
European Central Bank would raise interest rates as early as
April, boosting its yield advantage over the dollar.
 The euro held steady from late U.S. trade on Thursday at
$1.4174  after dipping to as low as $1.4150 earlier on the
news of Portugal being downgraded.
 There was talk of bids in the euro around $1.4140 to
$1.4150, while euro offers were cited near $1.4210 to $1.4220.
 The single currency is not far from a 4-½ month high of
$1.4249 hit earlier this week. If that level is breached, the
next significant peak on charts is the early November high of
$1.4283.
 In another sign of the dollar's broad weakness, the
Australian dollar hovered near its Dec. 31 peak around $1.0257
-- a level not seen since 1982. The Aussie dollar last stood at
$1.0189, down 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Thursday. 
 ""With U.S. equities rising on solid earnings it looks as if
risk appetite improving,"" said a trader for a major Japanese
bank in Tokyo.
 A plunge in Japanese equities last week on worries over the
economic toll from the earthquake and tsunami that struck
Japan's northeast on March 11 and fears over a quake-crippled
nuclear power plant had spurred a bout of risk aversion.
 But markets have since settled down, especially after the
Group of Seven industrialised nation's joint intervention to
stabilise the yen last Friday, the trader said. 
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, rose about 0.1 percent to 75.699 <.DXY>,
hovering near a low of 75.340 hit earlier this week, its lowest
since early December 2009.
 The dollar index has looked vulnerable on charts after its
recent drop below long-term trendline support connecting its
July 2008 low and November 2010 trough, and one possible
downside target is its 2009 low of 74.170.
 A trader at another Japanese bank in Tokyo said the 75 level
is now seen as major support for the dollar index. A breach of
that level could open way for further fall in dollar, he added.
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 80.99 yen ,
staying some ways above a record low of 76.25 yen hit last week.
 Market players are bracing for the possibility of further
yen-selling intervention by Japanese authorities if the dollar
drops below 80.00 yen. But dollar selling interest by Japanese
exporters ahead of the month-end is seen likely to temper any
gains in the dollar.
 The trader for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo said there
were dollar offers at levels above 81.50 yen.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, March 25 (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Friday as
optimism about upcoming company earnings encouraged foreign
buyers back into Asian markets, and the dollar retreated as
investors sold the low yielding currency in favour of riskier
assets.	
 The euro steadied despite a political crisis in Portugal
that prompted a downgrade from ratings agency S&P and added to
concerns over Europe's sovereign debt crisis. 
 ""The market is treating many of these downgrades as
rearguard actions which are already well discounted and the
dollar is under pressure broadly,"" said Todd Elmer, currency
strategist at Citi in Singapore.	
 ""This will continue to support the euro even if we do see
some marginal negative news on the sovereign debt crisis.""	
 Financial bookmakers forecast major European share markets
to open up 0.7-0.8 percent, while S&P 500 futures were up
0.4 percent, pointing to a firmer opening on Wall Street.	
 Gold retreated from a record struck on Thursday as unrest in
the Middle East and North Africa and a nuclear crisis in Japan
continued to support the metal's safe-haven appeal.	
 
 Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent, rounding off a week
of gains as foreign investors scooped up battered shares, with
analysts saying some technical indicators showed the market
heavily oversold. 
 The index is down 7 percent from its close on March 11, when
a massive earthquake and tsunami struck northeastern Japan. 
 The disaster left 27,400 people dead or missing, crippled a
nuclear power plant that has been leaking radiation and cut
power to millions of homes and factories.	
 ""More than 60 percent of stocks on the Tokyo stock
exchange's main board are trading below their book value,"" said
Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at Nikko Cordial Securities.	
 ""So it's time to buy back shares while watching problems at
the nuclear plant carefully.""	
 
 FOREIGN BUYERS	
 Foreign investors bought a net 891 billion yen ($11 billion)
of Japanese stocks last week, capital flows data from Japan's
Ministry of Finance showed on Friday, the highest weekly total
recorded in the data that goes back to 2005.	
 Foreigners were net buyers in other Asian markets, including
South Korea and Thailand.	
 ""With U.S. equities rising on solid earnings it looks as if
risk appetite improving,"" said a trader for a major Japanese
bank in Tokyo.	
 MSCI's index of Asian shares outside Japan
was up 1 percent, with the tech sub-index up 2
percent, following gains on Wall Street, where hopes of healthy
corporate earnings lifted the S&P 500 nearly 1 percent.

 The index remains down around 1 percent on the year,
underperforming the MSCI World index which is up
nearly 3 percent.	
 Strong buying of the Australian dollar fuelled talk of M&A
activity, with the benchmark index rising 0.9 percent
and rumoured takeover target Woodside Petroleum up 2.6
percent.	
 ""There has been some quite sizable buying of Aussie currency
with a view there may be some imminent large cap corporate
activity in our market,"" Shaw Stockbroking senior dealer Jamie
Spiteri said.	
 ""That has seen takeover talk BHP may make a move on Woodside
resurface."" 
 The Australian dollar traded around $1.0218, within
sight of a 29-year high of $1.0257 scaled on Dec. 31. The
dollar's weakness extended across a basket of major currencies,
with the dollar index hovering close to a 15-month low.	
 
 EURO RESILIENT	
 The resignation of Portugal's prime minister after
parliament voted down his minority government's austerity plans
had hit the euro on Thursday on expectations it increased the
chances of the indebted nation needing an EU bailout.	
 But the single currency rebounded later, as European Union
leaders began a summit in Brussels. The euro held steady from
late U.S. trade on Thursday at around $1.4170 , after
dipping to as low as $1.4150 earlier on the news of Portugal
being downgraded. 
 Investors in the single currency took comfort from
expectations the European Central Bank will raise interest rates
next month, thereby boosting its yield advantage over the dollar
as the U.S. Fed is expected to keep policy ultra-loose for some
time yet.	
 The yen traded near 81 per dollar , a level it has
clung tightly to all week since a rare coordinated intervention
by leading central banks to curb its appreciation last Friday.	
 Despite optimism in stock markets, investors remained
concerned about violence in Libya and the Middle East and a
nuclear crisis in Japan, where engineers were battling to
stabilise a power plant damaged by the quake. Safe-haven buying
drove gold to a record $1,447.40 an ounce on Thursday.	
 Spot gold retreated to around $1,433.35 an ounce on
Friday. 
 Oil eased a little, with U.S. crude edging down 17
cents to $105.43 a barrel and Brent crude 8 cents lower
at $115.64, but analysts said the trend remained upwards. 
 ""So long as ongoing problems in the Middle East continue to
elevate risks of a further supply disruption, there is a strong
likelihood of a price spike in the second quarter as the market
demands additional oil to meet summer demand,"" said JP Morgan
analysts headed by Lawrence Eagles.

(Adds S&P ratings downgrade of Portugal in paragraph 10)	
 By Luke Baker and Noah Barkin	
 BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - European leaders agreed on
Thursday to increase their financial rescue fund to the full 440
billion euros by June, but avoided discussion of Portugal which
is under pressure to seek a bailout following the resignation of
its prime minister.	
 Having said for weeks that they would agree a ""comprehensive
package"" to tackle the euro zone debt crisis by the end of
March, the leaders ended up delaying a final decision on
boosting their safety net until mid-year.	
 That agreement at a two-day summit in Brussels was lauded as
an accomplishment by Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the
European Council, but worries about Portugal's political crisis
overshadowed the meeting.	
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates quit on Wednesday after
parliament rejected new austerity measures that he had hoped
would allow the country to avoid following Greece and Ireland in
needing to ask for EU/IMF financial assistance.	
 He is the second euro zone leader to fall victim to the
rolling sovereign debt crisis after Ireland's prime minister was
booted out of office last month.	
 Despite stepping down, Socrates came to the two-day summit
and was warmly received by other leaders, diplomats said.	
 He resisted pressure from his peers to accept a bailout,
however, and made it clear that he would hold that line, at
least until a new Portuguese government is formed -- probably
after early elections in about two months' time.	
 The fall of the government prompted Fitch to cut Portugal's
credit rating by two notches to A-, saying risks to the
country's financing had risen after parliament failed to pass
fiscal consolidation measures.	
 The ratings agency warned further downgrades were likely in
the next three to six months in the absence of a ""timely and
credible"" EU/IMF support programme. 
 Standard & Poor's also cut Portugal's credit rating by two
notches to BBB and said a further cut could follow as soon as
next week depending on the shape of the euro zone bailout fund.

 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet told reporters as he left the summit that it was crucial
for Portugal to stick to the fiscal austerity measures Socrates
had proposed.	
 EU diplomats said Socrates had privately reassured other
leaders that no matter what sort of government emerges after new
elections, it would stick to the austerity programme.	
 The Portuguese upheaval underscored the wealth of political
obstacles the single currency bloc faces in trying to solve a
debt crisis that has deepened over the past year.	
 Only a few days ago, the summit had been expected to deliver
a full package that would reassure financial markets, but
Thursday's decisions fell short of what some investors had
expected only a few days ago.	
 
 
 IMF CONTAGION WORRIES	
 Senior euro zone officials said Portugal was likely to need
60-80 billion euros in assistance from the EU rescue fund and
the International Monetary Fund. No talks have begun yet and
will anyway have to wait until a new government is formed.	
 Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yields hit new highs on
Thursday, climbing to 7.90 percent, far above levels that
economists say would allow Lisbon to service its debt long term.	
 Lisbon needs to refinance about 4.5 billion euros of debt in
April and a similar amount in June, which may prove a trigger
for finally making the request for aid. 
 One problem is that any bailout request would have to be
approved by parliament and the majority is opposed to asking for
help. 
 With Portugal widely expected to seek assistance, attention
could soon shift to Spain, which has gradually won back the
confidence of investors in recent months by unveiling reforms of
the labour market and pension system, as well as a plan for
shoring up its ailing savings banks.	
 In a sign that contagion worries remain, sources told
Reuters in Washington that the head of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) would seek approval from member countries
next week to activate a $580 billion crisis fund.	
 ""The biggest worry is the high risk of contagion from
Portugal and general global uncertainty will trigger a new wave
of borrwing from the fund,"" one source said, noting that Spain
held one-third of Portugal's public debt.	
 
 SHORT OF A DEAL?	
 While leaders agreed they would finalise the increase in the
current bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability
Facility -- by June, they still have to negotiate political
hurdles in both Portugal and Finland to get that achieved.	
 They are also trying to put the finishing touches to the
European Stability Mechanism, a permanent rescue fund that will
replace the EFSF in mid-2013.	
 The ESM will have an effective capacity of 500 billion
euros, including 80 billion euros of paid-in capital.	
 The original intention was to inject that capital in two
tranches of 40 billion, but Germany secured a concession on
Thursday and the total will now be paid in via five equal annual
installments, beginning in July 2013.

 WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - Countries remain far from
a deal in long-running global trade talks that world leaders
have urged negotiators to complete this year, U.S. trade
officials said on Thursday.
 ""We share with other members a significant concern that the
Doha negotiations have not made the progress we had all hoped
they would achieve by now,"" Michael Punke, the U.S. ambassador
to the World Trade Organization, said in a statement.
 ""The fact is that the gaps among members remain wide. The

weeks to find productive ways forward,"" Punke said after a
meeting of 11 key WTO member countries.
 The downbeat assessment follows warnings from WTO Director
General Pascal Lamy that countries must pick up the pace of
negotiations to reach a deal by Dec. 31.
 The Doha Round of world trade talks was launched in 2001
with the goal of helping poor countries prosper through trade.
 Since the start, it has been plagued by disagreements over
how much the United States and the EU should cut farm subsidies
and tariffs -- and how much major developing countries should
open their markets in exchange.
 Although deep differences over those trade-offs remain,
substantial progress has been made in other areas of the talks.
 Lamy has estimated that 80 percent of the final deal is
already on the table. However, U.S. farm and business groups
argue that how issues in the remaining 20 percent are decided
will determine whether they can support it.

 NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose for a
sixth consecutive session on Thursday, recouping the losses
after Japan's natural disasters, while the euro jumped on
optimism that European policymakers will be able to control a
political and debt crisis in Portugal.
 U.S. stocks rose for a second day on optimism about
upcoming earnings and as the quarter's top performers drew
buyers.
 Some investors, however, continued to seek out safety,
driving gold to a record high of $1,447.40 an ounce, before
turning lower as investors took profits. Worries mounted about
the ongoing violence in the Middle East and fears that Portugal
will, in fact, need a bailout.
 Oil prices wobbled as U.N.-mandated air strikes hit Libya
for a fifth night, but failed to stop Muammar Gaddafi's tanks
from shelling rebel-held towns. A report a French plane had
taken down a Libyan jet raised more worries of a long supply

 STOCKS BET ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY
 Equity markets gained on bets on a continued economic
recovery that were coupled with the end of an upbeat quarter.
Light volume continued, however, underscoring caution.
 Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated

 NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday on optimism European policymakers will
be able to control a political and debt crisis in Portugal,
though technical resistance could cap near-term upside.
 The fall of the Portuguese government following the
resignation of its prime minister is expected to dominate a
summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday, with Lisbon under
intense pressure to seek a bailout package.
 The euro remained resilient, rising above $1.42 as traders
said most of the selling on concerns about Portugal had already
occurred. Still, upside for the euro looks limited, given
option barriers around $1.4250 and strong resistance near
$1.4280, the November high.
 ""The Portugal story was pretty much priced in,"" said
Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy at
BNY Mellon in Boston. ""Given the rapid events in Portugal and
the fall of the government, there might be something that comes
out of the summit today and tomorrow.""
 The euro rose as high as $1.42206 on trading platform EBS
and was last up 0.6 percent at $1.41717 . Traders
noted semi-official and Middle Eastern bids around the day's
lows and macro account demand. Offers were seen around
$1.4220.
 The single currency had earlier hit a low of $1.40534 on
EBS after Moody's downgraded 30 Spanish banks by one or more
notches, though notably not the biggest players, Santander and
BBVA. For details, see [ID:nLDE72N0B1]
 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned on
Wednesday after parliament rejected his government's latest
austerity measures aimed at avoiding EU financial assistance.
 Socrates remains adamantly opposed to requesting aid from
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund and has
made it clear he intends to hold that line, at least until a
new Portuguese government is formed in the weeks ahead. Lisbon
needs to refinance 4.5 billion euros of sovereign debt in
April, which could trigger a request for aid.
 Fitch on Thursday cut Portugal's credit ratings by two
notches, saying risks to the country's financing rose after
parliament failed to pass fiscal consolidation measures and the
prime minister resigned.
 European leaders are unlikely to take a decision on how to
strengthen the euro zone's bailout fund at this week's summit,
delaying the process until June. Traders said the development
is mildly negative, but unlikely to spark a sell-off in the
currency. [ID:nLDE72M1E6]
 Danske Bank recommends buying the euro, targeting $1.46. It
said negative factors were not enough to trigger a trend
reversal ""as the support from relative monetary policy and
global macro data remains very strong.""
 YIELD SUPPORT
 The euro was also supported by expectations the European
Central Bank will raise interest rates next month to counter
inflation pressures.
 That would further move the yield differential in favor of
the euro, as the U.S. Federal Reserve last week reiterated its
pledge to keep interest rates -- now at virtually zero -- at
very low levels for an extended period.
 Data on Thursday showed new orders for long-lasting U.S.
manufactured goods fell in February, hinting at some unexpected
softness in manufacturing and business investment plans.
[ID:nN24115372]
 The Federal Reserve is ""still very cautious, and the latest
numbers do indicate that it's still a time to just wait and see
how the economic data come in,"" said BNY Mellon's Shankar.
 Some in the market question the ECB's intent to tighten
monetary policy at a time when some euro-zone economies are
suffering, an issue that may haunt the euro in the future.
 ""I find it very, very hard for them to hike interest rates
at this point, simply because of what we're seeing in those
outside economies,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president
of capital markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""I think
they will continue the hawkish rhetoric, but I don't think
they're going to move yet.""
 Against the yen, the dollar was little changed at 80.97 yen
. Market players remained wary that Japan may intervene
further if the dollar drops below 80 yen, especially if such a
move occurs in volatile trade.

Thursday to reinforce radiation controls on imports of food and
animal feed from Japan to guard against contamination from the

 Food and feed from the 12 worst affected prefectures will
have to be tested for radionuclides before leaving Japan, and be
accompanied by a declaration from the Japanese authorities that
they do not breach EU radiation limits, the European Commission
said in a statement.
 When the food arrives in Europe, at least 10 percent of it
will be randomly checked, including using laboratory analysis.
Random inspections will also be made on 20 percent of food
imports from Japan's other 35 prefectures.
 The 12 prefectures concerned are: Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki,
Tochigi, Miyagi, Yamagata, Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama,
Tokyo and Chiba.
 European governments approved the measures at a meeting of
the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and
they are expected to enter force on Sunday.

* Cost of interventions not found on balance sheet-Danthine
(Adds background and details)
 ZURICH, March 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank has
the right tools to maintain stable prices and absorb the
billions of francs it pumped into markets via its
interventions in 2009 and 2010, board member Jean-Pierre
Danthine said on Thursday.
 The SNB began selling francs for euros in March 2009 to
stave off the risk of deflation exacerbated by a strong franc.
But it dropped them last June, saying the risks had
dissipated. [ID:nLDE65E1W2]
 Since then, the SNB has been using auctions of its own
debt -- so-called SNB bills -- and reverse repos to withdraw
the liquidity, and Danthine said these were an ""efficient
toolset"" for the future.
 ""They place the SNB in a sound position to steer the LIBOR
rate at the level to maintain price stability,"" Danthine said
in the text of a speech for a money market event in Zurich.
 Domestic conditions were of prime importance in
determining monetary policy although the SNB had an eye on the
rest of the world as well/
 ""In Switzerland, we have to consider the Swiss situation,""
Danthine said.
 The Swiss National Bank has come under heavy fire for tens
of billions of francs in losses it ran up last year from its
foreign-exchange interventions, and Chairman Philipp
Hildebrand has faced calls to resign. [ID:nLDE7220BQ]
 But Danthine said the SNB had not been defeated by markets
in its interventions.
 The SNB's policy should not be judged by the red ink on
its balance sheet, but by how inflation developed over time,
Danthine said.
""Our foreign-exchange interventions will be revealed to
have been costly if they result in serious inflationary
pressure two to three years from now,"" he said.
 At its policy review on March 17, the SNB dropped any
reference to deflation risks in its statement, adding that
interest rates could not stay at rock bottom forever as
inflation is set to breach its price stability threshold of 2
percent by mid-2013. [ID:nLDE72F1D8]

 By Mayumi Negishi and Kazunori Takada	
 TOKYO, March 25 (Reuters) - Workers burned trying to cool a
crippled Japanese nuclear plant were exposed to radiation levels
10,000 times higher than normal, officials said on Friday, but
they played down suggestions that a reactor was leaking.	
 A rupture in a reactor would mean a serious reversal
following days of slow progress in containing radiation leaks
after a killer earthquake and tsunami tore through the Fukushima
nuclear power complex two weeks ago.	
 Over 10,000 people were killed and 17,500 remain missing in
the disaster, according to latest police figures. But even those
numbers have been eclipsed by the possibility of a catastrophic
meltdown at Fukushima, just 250 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.	
 More than 700 engineers have been working in shifts around
the clock to stabilise the six-reactor Fukushima complex but
they pulled out of some parts when three workers replacing a
cable at the No. 3 reactor were exposed to high contamination on
Thursday, officials said. 
 Two were taken to hospital with possible radiation burns
after radioactive water seeped over their boots. 
 ""The contaminated water had 10,000 times the amount of
radiation as would be found in water circulating from a normally
operating reactor,"" said Japanese nuclear agency official
Hidehiko Nishiyama.	
 ""It is possible that there is damage to the reactor.""	
 But Nishiyama later told reporters: ""It could be from
venting operations and there could be some water leakage from
pipes or from valves, but there is no data suggesting a crack.""	
 However, adding confusion to the picture, plant operator
Tokyo Electric Power Co said it was possible the
contaminated water had come from the reactor's core.	
 Also on Friday, Japan prodded tens of thousands of more
people living near Fukushima to leave, while China said two
Japanese travellers arriving in the country were found to have
exceedingly high radiation levels.

 Hideo Morimoto, director at the Agency for Natural Resources
and Energy, also said the incident at the No. 3 reactor was not
serious.	
 ""I feel if the pressure vessel has been seriously damaged,
then far more radiation would have leaked,""he said.	
 However, the reactor is also the only one to use plutonium
in its fuel mix, which is more toxic than the uranium used in
the other reactors.	
 U.N. nuclear watchdog IAEA said a total of 17 workers had
received elevated levels of radiation at Fukushima since the
operations began, but said the other 14 did not suffer burns.

 RADIATION IN TRAVELLERS	
 China's General Administration of Quality Supervision,
Inspection and Quarantine said two travellers who arrived in the
eastern city of Wuxi from Tokyo were found to have high levels
of radiation although they presented no risk to others. 
 ""Tests showed that the two travellers seriously exceeded the
limit,"" it said in a statement.	
 Until now, no one in Japan except workers at the stricken
plant has been found with seriously elevated radiation levels,
and Japan's foreign ministry noted that as of March 18 the
International Civil Aviation Association had declared that
screening of airline passengers from Japan was not necessary.	
 Japan's chief cabinet secretary said 130,000 people living
near Fukushima should consider leaving, although he insisted it
was because getting supplies to the region was difficult and
maintained it was not an evacuation order.	
 ""Given how prolonged the situation has become, we think it
would be desirable for people to voluntarily evacuate in order
to meet their social needs,"" Yukio Edano said.	
 Japan evacuated a 20-km (12-mile) zone around the Fukushima
nuclear plant after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Seventy
thousand people left their homes.	
 Edano has maintained there was no need currently to expand
the evacuation zone, but an official at the Science Ministry
confirmed that daily radiation levels in an area 30 km (18
miles) northwest of the plant exceeded the annual limit.	
 Safety fears at the plant and beyond -- radiation particles
have been found as far away as Iceland -- are compounding
Japan's worst crisis since World War Two.

 RECEDING	
 Despite the increased radiation reports, there has been some
progress in containing the crisis at Fukushima.	
 Two of the reactors are now regarded as safe in what is
called a cold shutdown. Four remain volatile, emitting steam and
smoke periodically, but work is advancing to restart water pumps
needed to cool fuel rods inside those reactors.	
 The United States has been offering aid to its ally Japan,
and two of its barges will together provide 525,000 gallons (2.0
million litres) of water for cooling the reactors.	
 But heightened by widespread public ignorance of the
technicalities of radiation, alarm has been spreading.	
 Vegetable and milk shipments from the areas near the plant
have been stopped, and Tokyo's 13 million residents were told
this week not to give tap water to babies after contamination
from rain put radiation at twice the safety level. 
 It dropped back to safe levels the next day, and the city
governor cheerily drank water in front of cameras at a water
purifying plant.	
 Despite government reassurances and appeals for people not
to panic, there has been a rush on bottled water and shelves in
many Tokyo shops remained empty of the product on Friday. 
 In the latest contamination finds, Kyodo reported that
radioactive caesium 1.8 times higher than the standard level was
found in a leafy vegetable grown at a Tokyo research
facility. 
 Experts say radiation leaking from the plant is still mainly
below levels of exposure from flights or dental and medical
x-rays.	
 Nevertheless, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, the
United States and Hong Kong are all restricting food and milk
imports from the zone. Other nations are screening Japanese
food, and German shipping companies are simply avoiding the
nation.	
 In Japan's north, more than a quarter of a million people
are in shelters. Exhausted rescuers are still sifting through
the wreckage of towns and villages, retrieving bodies and
pulling out photos for the consolation of survivors.	
 Authorities are burying unidentified bodies in mass graves,
despite Japan's usual Buddhist practice of cremation. 
 Amid the suffering, though, there was a sense that Japan was
turning the corner in its humanitarian crisis. Aid flowed to
refugees, and phone, electricity, postal and bank services began
returning to the north, albeit sometimes by makeshift means.	
 Owners of small businesses began cleaning up their premises
in the worst-hit areas.
   ""Everybody on this block has the firm belief that they are
going to bring this thing back again,"" said Mario Kariya in the
town of Kamaishi, as he cleaned the family-owned Kariya Coffee
of debris.	
 The estimated $300 billion damage from the quake and tsunami
makes this the world's costliest natural disaster. Global
financial market jitters over Japan's crisis have calmed, though
supply disruptions are affecting the automobile and technology
sectors.	
 Foreigner investor buying of Japanese shares actually
reached a record high in the week after the disaster, data
showed, as bargain-hunters leaped in when stocks first plunged.

 * Discrepancy on imports due to items transiting Germany
 
 By Marcin Goettig
 WARSAW, 24 March (Reuters) - An apparent multi-billion euro
discrepancy in Polish and German trade data merely reflects
different treatment of exports and imports under international
accounting rules, Poland's statistics office said on Thursday.
 Markets were set on edge on Monday when an adviser to the
Polish central bank governor said errors and omissions in
Poland's 2010 balance of payments data amounting to 4 percent of
gross domestic product could be due to underestimated imports.
 The adviser, Miroslaw Gronicki, said Poland reported a 2
billion euro surplus in trade with Germany last year, while
Germany reported a surplus of 12 billion. That left a 14-billion
euro hole that could potentially be explained by Poland
underestimating its imports. 
 German data later seen by Reuters revealed a difference of
11.7 billion euros compared with the Polish data.
 Gronicki's comments spooked economists, who said that such a
large gap could possibly reduce past growth figures, reveal
wider-than-reported budget deficits, cause the current account
gap to widen and potentially push public debt to above a 55
percent ceiling that would trigger severe budget cuts.
 ""Worries that Polish imports may be significantly revised
upwards contributed to the zloty's undereperformance in the last
few days,"" said Piotr Kalisz, chief economist at Citibank
Handlowy in Warsaw.
 But the Polish statistics office said the difference in what
Berlin reported as exports to Poland and what Warsaw counted as
imports from Germany derived from the fact that many of the
goods had a different country of origin.
 ""Comparable data on foreign trade between Poland and Germany
show a high degree of conformity,"" Ewa Adach-Stankiewicz, head
of the trade and services department at the Polish statistics
office, told Reuters in an e-mail. 
 
 CHINESE IMPORTS
 She said both countries considered exports as all goods sent
from either Poland or Germany to the other, but import figures
were based on the country of origin rather than dispatch.
 In this case, a large amount of Chinese goods which came to
Poland via Germany counted as German exports to Poland but not
as Polish imports from Germany.
 ""Foreign trade statistics in all EU countries must respect
the methodology of the U.N. statistics department,"" she said.
 ""Data on imports are presented for the country of origin...
while exports data are presented on the basis of destination
country.""
 Among other research groups investigating the discrepancy,
Danske Bank issued a report on the topic, saying a large upward
revision in imports could have negative consequences for
economic data and markets.
 The statistics office's explanation also does not explain
the 13.7 billion euro deficit in the ""errors and omissions""
section of the balance of payments data for 2010, which is
larger than the deficit on the current account of 11.6 billion
euros.
 That balance of payments data falls under the responsibility
of the central bank, which for many years has been trying to
clarify the large ""errors and omissions"" category of the data.
 Earlier this week central bank governor Marek Belka told
Obserwatorfinansowy.pl website that the errors and omissions
""keep us awake at night"" and the bank is working to explain
them.

are holding elections this year, making 2011 a crucial test for
Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling centre-right coalition of
Christian Democrats (CDU) and Free Democrats (FDP).
 Merkel's CDU already lost control of Hamburg to the
centre-left Social Democrats in the first state vote on Feb. 20
and could be defeated in another vote on Sunday in
Baden-Wuerttemberg. The next federal election is set for 2013.
 Following are details of the state elections. 
 
 March 27 - BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG 
 The wealthy southwestern state is a traditional CDU bastion
but is shaping up as a major test for Merkel. Losing the state,
an economic powerhouse, could leave Merkel vulnerable to attack
within her party, analysts say.
 Having ruled the state since 1953, the CDU has angered
voters by pushing ahead with the construction of a railway
station in Stuttgart despite a wave of at times violent protests
.
 The CDU has also been hurt by the nuclear disaster in Japan
and Merkel's decision to abruptly shut down, at least
temporarily, seven of Germany's 17 nuclear plants after she had
pressed for extending the lives of nuclear power in Germany.
 A recent poll put the CDU, led in the state by premier
Stefan Mappus, at 38 percent, with the FDP at 5 percent. The SPD
and Greens have a 5 point lead with each polling 24 percent.
Losing the state would be a heavy setback for Merkel. 
 
 March 27 - RHINELAND-PALATINATE 
 Kurt Beck of the SPD has been premier of the rural western
state for 17 years and has ruled with an absolute majority over
the past five years. Polls show he should be able to retain
power -- with the surging Greens as a coalition partner.
 The CDU has put forward Julia Kloeckner, 38. Also warranting
attention is the FDP if they make it into the state assembly;
they are now polling 5 percent, just enough to clear the hurdle.
 
 May 22 - BREMEN 
 The city-state has had SPD mayors since 1945 and that is
unlikely to change. Jens Boehrnsen is likely to win the race. 
The SPD, polling around 34 percent, has governed in a
coalition with the Greens, at 20 percent, the past five years.
 
 Sept. 4 - MECKLENBURG-VORPOMMERN 
 Erwin Sellering of the SPD took over his predecessor's grand
coalition with the CDU in 2008 after the latter resigned. 
 In recent polls, the SPD leads the CDU by 3 points. The Left
-- currently at 15 percent -- could tip the balance if the SPD
gets the most votes and opts for a coalition with them rather
than another grand coalition with the CDU.
 
 Sept. 18 - BERLIN 
 The Greens stand a strong chance of winning one of the
country's top political posts, with Renate Kuenast, a minister
in Germany's last SPD-Greens government, challenging incumbent
Mayor Klaus Wowereit of the SPD. 
 The SPD are just ahead of the Greens in polls. An SPD-Greens
coalition or an SPD-Left coalition are possible. 
 
 Following are details of the first two 2011 state elections:
 February 20 - HAMBURG 
 The CDU was swept from power in Hamburg with their worst
result since World War Two, plunging 20.7 percentage points from
the last election to 21.9 percent.
 Losing Hamburg and its three seats in the Bundesrat, or
upper house, left Merkel's coalition four votes short in the
69-seat chamber, making it far more difficult to try to get
legislation through without concessions to opposition demands. 
 
 March 20 - SAXONY-ANHALT 
 The CDU fell 3.7 points to 32.5 percent in the poor eastern
state of Saxony-Anhalt but will likely be able to remain in
power in a grand coalition with the SPD, who won 21.5 percent.
The FDP won only 3.8 percent of the vote and were ejected from
the state assembly in Magdeburg, which party chief Guido
Westerwelle, the foreign minister, called a ""bitter defeat"".

favor of the euro, as the U.S. Federal Reserve last week
reiterated its pledge to keep interest rates -- now at

 Some in the market question the ECB's intent to tighten
monetary policy at a time when some euro-zone economies are
suffering, an issue that may haunt the euro in the future.
 ""I find it very, very hard for them to hike interest rates
at this point, simply because of what we're seeing in those
outside economies,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president
of capital markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""I

* CDU has run Baden-Wuerttemberg for nearly 60 years
 * Japan nuclear crisis boosts environmentalist protest
 
 By Hendrik Sackmann
 STUTTGART, Germany, March 24 (Reuters) - Economic prosperity
and five decades of history may not be enough to prevent
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives losing power in one of
Germany's biggest states on Sunday.
 The industrial state of Baden-Wuerttemberg is leading
Germany's recovery from recession, but the chancellor seems
unable to stop a host of outside factors -- Japan's nuclear
crisis, Portugal's debt woes, Libya -- eroding CDU support.
 The election is the most important of seven state polls this
year, and defeat for the CDU after 58 unbroken years in power in
Stuttgart would be a huge blow to Merkel as she fights to shore
up her political authority.
 A Forsa poll published on Thursday predicted victory in the
state of 11 million people for the combined Social Democrats
(SPD) and Greens, coming in 5 points ahead of the conservatives.
 It predicted Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) would get
the most votes but not enough in combination with their weakened
Free Democrat (FDP) partners to outgun the centre left.
 Merkel was already facing failure in the state when the
Libyan revolt, Japanese earthquake and nuclear breakdown came
out of the blue to present her with huge policy headaches.
 ""Not every global political event is an issue in a state
election,"" Merkel said this week as her party tried to decouple
the international events from local issues in the state.
 ""The nuclear debate is helping the Greens now but the CDU
and FDP will still win because Baden-Wuerttemberg is the most
successful region in Europe,"" said CDU national parliamentary
chief whip Volker Kauder, who is from the state. ""People here
won't vote out those who made the state so successful.""
 Merkel last week suspended a government agreement prolonging
the life of the nation's nuclear power stations as Japanese
engineers struggled to avoid a nuclear meltdown after the quake.
 Local and nationwide polls show Merkel's response is
undermining her and widening the centre left's established lead.
 
 BIG GREEN SHADOW
 At state level, Forsa's poll suggested that nuclear power
and concerns over a railway project in the state capital
Stuttgart topped voters' concerns -- boosting the anti-nuclear
Greens and their likely SPD coalition partners.
 Conservatives in a state that makes Mercedes-Benz and
Porsche cars are annoyed by Merkel's nuclear moratorium, making
it look like a doubly risky electoral tactic.
 Thorsten Faas, a politics professor at Mannheim University
in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said the media prominence of the nuclear
story could easily sway the high number of undecided voters --
40 percent in the Forsa poll -- towards the Greens.
 While the Greens might not do well enough to win their first
state premiership, their gains suggest a changing landscape.
 ""A few years ago it would have been impossible to imagine
Baden-Wuerttemberg with a non-CDU state premier. But things have
changed here and the Greens especially have grown,"" he said.
 He said losing Baden-Wuerttemberg could be disastrous for
the CDU, comparable to the SPD's loss of its stronghold of North
Rhine-Westphalia in 2005, which forced then-chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder to call a national election that put Merkel in power
at the head of a CDU-SPD ""Grand Coalition"".
 Merkel's future would depend on whether CDU bigwigs blame
her, or CDU state premier Stefan Mappus and the FDP instead, and
if any rival emerges in the CDU -- a rare commodity so far.
 Commentators on the right and left, such as the former
Greens foreign minister Joschka Fischer, say she isolated
Germany on the international stage by breaking with NATO to
abstain on the U.N. vote on military action over Libya.
 This risks reversing the political recovery in recent weeks
of her foreign minister, FDP chief Guido Westerwelle, who had
been gaining ground with some deft diplomacy in North Africa.
 The FDP did well in Hamburg last month but lost its place in
Saxony-Anhalt's assembly when the CDU just clung to power. If it
fails in Baden-Wuerttemberg and does not win a seat in less
strategic SPD-run Rhineland-Palatinate the same day, its leader
could also face the music in April's party convention.
 Before Japan and Libya, Merkel's main concern had been
isolating the vote from the euro crisis by taking a tough line
on bailout funds for the likes of Greece, Ireland and maybe
Portugal to assure taxpayers she will not waste their money.
 EU stalling on bailout funds could spare her bad headlines
from this week's summit in newspapers critical of more euro zone
largesse, but she has already been accused of ""Zig Zag Politics""
on nuclear and foreign policy by mass-circulation Bild.

losses after Japan's natural disasters, while the euro jumped
on optimism that European policymakers will be to control a
political and debt crisis in Portugal.

Moody's and rising borrowing costs for Portugal had weighed on
the euro earlier.

 * Hryvnia weakens slightly
 * No progress on prerequisites for the next IMF loan tranche

(Adds quotes, background)
 KIEV, March 24 (Reuters) - Ukraine's central bank said on
Thursday it saw no need to adjust its exchange rate policy after
the hryvnia weakened to a three-month low of 7.97 per dollar.
 ""The (exchange rate) movements are within 0.5-1 kopeck,
which is microscopic volatility,"" said Valery Lytvytsky, an
adviser to central bank Chairman Serhiy Arbuzov, referring to
one hundredth of a hryvnia.
 ""The situation on the foreign exchange market follows the
forecasts and does not require any adjustments to our exchange
rate policy.""
 The central bank's net foreign currency purchases on the
local market amounted to almost $500 million so far this month,
Lytvytsky said.
 The bank intervened in the market on Thursday to support the
hryvnia, offering to sell dollars at 7.97 hryvnias per dollar
. The hryvnia had hovered around 7.95 per dollar since
mid-January.
 ""Our reserves give us full confidence that we will overcome
this volatility, which is mostly due to the changes in newsflow
both at home and abroad,"" he said.
 Ukraine failed to reach an agreement with a visiting IMF
mission last month as the government delayed a planned pension
reform and sought to soften a planned increase in energy prices
for households.
 That prompted the IMF to delay the disbursement of the next
$1.6 billion tranche of Ukraine's $15 billion stand-by facility.
Ukraine officials then said parliament would vote on the pension
reform bill in mid-March but that has not happened.

 By Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - Portugal's political crisis
and the resignation of the prime minister dominated the agenda
of an EU summit on Thursday, further complicating efforts to
solve the euro zone's debt problems.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates quit on Wednesday after
parliament rejected new austerity measures that he had hoped
would allow the country to avoid following Greece and Ireland in
needing to seek EU/IMF financial assistance.
 He is the second euro zone leader to fall victim to the
rolling sovereign debt crisis after Ireland's prime minister was
booted out of office last month.
 Despite stepping down, Socrates came to the two-day summit.
He remains adamantly opposed to requesting aid and has made it
clear he intends to hold that line, at least until a new
Portuguese government is formed, probably after early elections
in about two months' time.
 ""The government will continue to fight against the
possibility of resorting to foreign aid,"" cabinet minister Pedro
Silva Pereira said in Lisbon.
 The fall of the government prompted Fitch to cut Portugal's
credit rating by two notches to A-, saying risks to the
country's financing had risen after parliament failed to pass
fiscal consolidation measures.
 The ratings agency warned further downgrades are likely in
the next three to six months in the absence of a ""timely and
credible"" EU/IMF support programme.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet told
reporters as he left the summit that it was crucial for Portugal
to stick to the fiscal austerity measures Socrates had proposed.
 EU diplomats said Socrates had privately reassured other
leaders that no matter which government emerges after new
elections, it would stick to the austerity programme.
 The Portuguese upheaval underscored the wealth of political
obstacles the single currency bloc faces in trying to solve
a debt crisis that has deepened over the past year.
 Only a few days ago, the summit had been expected to deliver
a ""comprehensive package"" of new measures that would reassure
financial markets, but now leaders have been thrown onto the
defensive and could struggle to show unity and resolve.
 
 IMF CONTAGION WORRIES
 Senior euro zone officials said Portugal was likely to need
60-80 billion euros in assistance from the EU rescue fund and
the International Monetary Fund. No talks have begun yet and
will anyway have to wait until a new government is formed.
 Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yields hit new highs on
Thursday, climbing to 7.90 percent, far above levels that
economists say would allow Lisbon to service its debt on a
sustainable basis.
 The euro has remained strong through the latest bout of
turmoil, rising steadily for much of 2011. It was hovering just
under four-month highs at $1.4170 on Thursday.
 Lisbon needs to refinance about 4.5 billion euros of debt in
April and a similar amount in June, which may prove a trigger
for finally making the request for aid. One problem is that any
bailout request would have to be approved by parliament and the
majority is opposed to asking for help.
 With Portugal widely expected to seek assistance, attention
could soon shift to Spain, which has gradually won back the
confidence of investors in recent months by unveiling reforms of
the labour market and pension system, as well as a plan for
shoring up its ailing savings banks.
 In a sign that contagion worries remain, however, sources
told Reuters in Washington that the head of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) would seek approval from member countries
next week to activate a $580 billion crisis fund.
 ""The biggest worry is the high risk of contagion from
Portugal and general global uncertainty will trigger a new wave
of borrwing from the fund,"" one source said, noting that Spain
held one-third of Portugal's public debt.
 
 UNRAVELLING?
 European leaders surprised markets with what looked like a
strong agreement at a March 11 meeting on a range of anti-crisis
measures that they were expected to rubber-stamp at the summit
this week. But key elements have been unravelling ever since.
 A decision on how to increase the effective lending capacity
of the bloc's current bailout fund -- the European Financial
Stability Facility -- is now expected to be delayed until
mid-year.
 Finland is the main obstacle to a decision, since it has
dissolved parliament ahead of elections on April 17 and
therefore cannot sign off on a deal.
 A new Finnish government is only likely to be formed by May
at the earliest, and that government may include the eurosceptic
True Finns party, which wants to renegotiate the EU's proposed
crisis steps, further complicating the outlook.
 In addition to the EFSF impasse, there are also differences
about how member states should finance the 500 billion euro
European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the fund that is to replace
the EFSF in mid-2013.
 Merkel is demanding changes to an ESM funding deal that her
finance minister signed off on at the start of the week because
that deal would have limited her ability to push through tax
cuts before the next federal election in 2013.
 The German U-turn, Finnish EFSF roadblock and delays in
providing debt relief to Ireland pending stress tests for its
stricken banks have contributed to a sense in financial markets
that EU member states are endlessly at odds over how best to
handle the debt crisis.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday on optimism European policymakers will
be able to control a political and debt crisis in Portugal,
though technical resistance could cap near-term upside.
 The fall of the Portuguese government following the
resignation of its prime minister is expected to dominate a
summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday, with Lisbon under
intense pressure to seek a bailout package.
 The euro remained resilient, rising above $1.42 as traders
said most of the selling on concerns about Portugal had already
occurred. Still, upside for the euro looks limited given option
barriers around $1.4250 and strong resistance near $1.4280, the
November high.

Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy at
BNY Mellon in Boston. ""Given the rapid events in Portugal and
the fall of the government, there might be something that comes

 The euro rose as high as $1.4213 on trading platform EBS,
and was last up 0.7 percent at $1.4185. Traders noted
semi-official and Middle Eastern bids around the day's lows and
macro account demand. Offers were seen around $1.4220.
 The single currency had earlier hit a low of $1.4053 on EBS
after Moody's downgraded 30 Spanish banks by one or more
notches, though notably not the biggest players, Santander and
BBVA. See

 By Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, March 24 (Reuters) - Hungary's government has not
packed the central bank's policy council with its own nominees
for no reason and the outcome now looks likely to be
liquidity-based stimulus measures to boost economic growth.
 Since the ruling Fidesz party gave itself the power to
appoint a majority of the 7-strong panel, analysts have been
confident that the new board would not outright slash interest
rates to speed a recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.
 Its new members have given signals in the past weeks of that
sort of independent and moderate policy line -- in contrast to
the government's outright criticism of higher rates. 
 But the Fidesz-appointed chairman of the bank's supervisory
board Zsigmond Jarai raised again this week the idea that the
bank could use the sort of stimulus employed in the United
States and elsewhere to pump more cash into the economy.
 That would most likely consist of the bank buying bonds
issued by state development bank MFB, which could then lend
money on, making loans cheaper for businesses to kickstart
lacklustre lending.
 It may be more of a coincidence that one of the four new
members in the 7-strong panel, Ferenc Gerhardt, was the MFB's
deputy chief executive post until his appointment this week.
 ""I think Jarai meant a mix of MFB support, bank regulation
around fx loans and boosting lending from banks through further
buying of mortgage bonds that the NBH did in a lacklustre way
through last year,"" said Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto.
 The bank has so far batted back suggestions from the
government that it should buy MFB bonds in the secondary market,
and raised its base rate by 75 basis points between November and
January to 6 percent citing inflation risks. [ID:nLDE6851BF]
 But the Fidesz government -- which said the rate hikes were
unjustified -- has packed the rate-setting Council with its own
appointees this month to corner Governor Andras Simor and his
two deputies, who are now in a minority on the panel.
 ""The four new government-appointed MC members have eased
market concerns that a politicized MC could quickly reverse
recent interest rate increases,"" Barclays said in a note.
 ""However, the underlying tensions between the government
and Governor Simor, whose term only expires in 2013, remain.""
 
 FEW OPTIONS
 The government is struggling to boost growth and there is
little fiscal wiggle room to pump money into the economy.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said last year that the
NBH's policy was too conservative and it should buy corporate
bonds in the market, primarily those of MFB, to help the
government in its efforts to boost growth. [ID:nLDE6820OO]
 The new rate setters might also want to reduce the NBH's
reserves to help the government's drive to cut debt, but that is
less likely as long as markets remain shaky, analysts said.
 ""Government bond buying by the NBH is also possible, but
markets would immediately see that the only purpose is pushing
yields (government interest rate costs) lower, and that could
have a damaging market impact,"" said Zsolt Kondrat of MKB.
 Hungary's market creditors have so far given it the benefit
of the doubt over an unorthodox policy mix that has included
levying big taxes on banks and other business sectors and
renationalising the mandatory private pension pillar.
 Any sort of liquidity injection risks a market backlash.
 ""Look what happened to the zloty when the Polish finance
ministry did quantitative easing by the backdoor by receiving
rates [ID:nLDE72D13R],"" said Nomura's Montalto. 
 ""(Monetary stimulus) would be negative to the forint.""
 
 BANKS RESISTANCE
 MFB bond buying will still require the backing of commercial
banks who have been burdened with Europe's highest bank tax and
the government is in talks now with banks about a complex set of
issues to end a moratorium on mortgage evictions by July 1.
 Banks have huge free liquidity held in the NBH's two-week
bills, totalling 4.267 trillion forints ($22.37 billion). 
 But they are risk-averse and reluctant to lend to companies
even though demand for loans is rising [ID:nLDE71N0ZV].
 A member of the Banking Association's presidency told
Reuters he believed the NBH buying bonds of MFB would
unnecessarily increase costs and risks undertaken by the state.
 ""The real solution is restoring the normal operation of the
market as quickly as possible,"" Daniel Gyuris said. ""Every
one-off, drastic intervention increases risks.""
 The government first needs to agree with the banks to set up
a state asset management firm and share losses on defaulted
mortgage loans with borrowers and banks, which could reassure
the banks and restore goodwill.
 And above all, it needs to implement promised fiscal reforms
fully, to ensure policy predictability and boost the economy.
 ""It must carry out the reforms pledged early this month
without watering them up,"" said CIB Bank's Gyorgy Barta.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2011 10:52AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Portugal govt says to keep rejecting bailout," * Socrates at EU summit Thursday despite resignation
* Minister says foreign aid bad for economy
 
(Adds quotes, details)
 LISBON, March 24 (Reuters) - Portugal's government will
continue rejecting an international bailout following Prime
Minister Jose Socrates' resignation tendered on Wednesday,
Cabinet Minister Pedro Silva Pereira said on Thursday.
 ""The government will continue to fight against the
possibility of resorting to foreign aid... Our position is clear
-- rejection of foreign aid,"" he told reporters after a cabinet
meeting, adding that the government did not consider a bailout
as inevitable.
 ""Foreign aid would have very serious consequences for the
economy,"" he said.
 Portuguese opposition parties refused to support the latest
package of austerity steps announced by the minority Socialist
government on March 11, forcing Socrates to resign on Wednesday.
 Despite the resignation, Socrates is still attending a
two-day European Union summit in Brussels on Thursday and
Friday, and there has been speculation that he could ask for a
bailout there as Portuguese bond yields hit new euro lifetime
highs.
 Socrates has been adamantly opposed to requesting aid and
the government intends to hold that line, at least until a new
government is formed, which is expected to take about two months
if a snap election is called.
 Silva Pereira also said that the measures rejected by
parliament were mere proposals and did not represent a final
economic plan, thus the Portuguese state was not bound by those
measures despite having won Brussels' praise for them earlier.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she regretted the
rejection of the measures in parliament and urged the political
parties to stick to the goals of the country's fiscal
consolidation programme.
 These goals include cutting the budget deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product this year, to 3 percent in
2012 and to 2 percent 2013. The government has said the deficit
reached around 7 percent last year, below a target of 7.3
percent.

a sixth consecutive session on Thursday, recovering losses
stemming from Japan's natural disasters, while Portugal's
borrowing costs soared after its prime minister quit, making a

 By Anooja Debnath and Yati Himatsingka
 BANGALORE, March 24 (Reuters) - European stocks are set to
climb steadily through the year, as positive corporate earnings
and a possible resolution to the nagging euro zone debt crisis
buoys investor sentiment, a Reuters poll showed.
 To some, European stocks still look cheap after the near 6
percent slide in pan-European averages in 2010, when euro zone
sentiment was knocked by bailouts for both Greece and Ireland
and policymakers scrambled to contain the crisis.
 The Euro STOXX 50 blue chip index is expected to touch 2,950
points by mid-2011, up nearly 6 percent from last year's close
according to a poll of 36 strategists, taken over the past week.
It is then expected to rise to 3,150 by the end of 2011, a gain
of almost 13 percent.
 The poll also showed the broader Euro STOXX 600 ending 2011
at 305 points, a rise of around 11 percent versus the 9 percent
gain seen last year.
 ""European earnings growth will be double-digit this year,
underpinning the equity markets. This is coupled currently with
very attractive valuations levels,"" said Gerhard Schwarz, Head
of Equity Strategy at Baader Bank.
 The Euro STOXX 50 index fell 7 percent in six trading
sessions in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake in Japan
but is still up around 3 percent so far this year.
 The polls showed Germany's benchmark DAX index and France's
CAC 40 are expected to close this year around 11 percent and 13
percent higher than last year's official close respectively.
 Britain's FTSE 100 is seen ending the year at 6,250 points,
gaining around 6 percent from 2010's close.
 ""There are quite a few risk factors in the market. Japan,
the Middle East, the oil price, food inflation, can act as a
catalyst to provoke a correction in the markets,"" said Philippe
Gijsels at BNP Paribas Fortis Capital Markets.
 The biggest macroeconomic risk so far to European shares has
been the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone's periphery.
 EU leaders meet Thursday and Friday to try to hammer out a
long-term solution and put an end to speculation over which
country is next to follow Greece and Ireland.
 Portugal inched closer to seeking a bailout, which a
majority of economists polled by Reuters expect to happen, and
perhaps very soon.
 Portugal Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned on Wednesday
after parliament rejected his government's latest set of
austerity proposals aimed at trying to avoid EU assistance to
get its finances back in order.
 But increasingly Spain, which months ago was subject to
speculation it too would need a bailout, is no longer in the
market's crosshairs.
 At the same time, positive economic data out of the euro
area, led by its strongest economies, Germany and France, is
likely to lend further support to European shares more broadly.
 The euro zone flash PMIs for March pointed to a strong
quarter for economic growth, 0.8 percent or even higher compared
with a more tepid 0.3 percent quarterly rate at the end of 2010.

 The economic data have been strong enough, along with a
pickup in inflation, for the European Central Bank to give clear
signals that interest rates will rise next month from their
record low of 1.0 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Thursday, lifted by an increase in appetite for risk,
though concern about debt problems in Portugal and Spain could
see the single currency come under renewed pressure.
 Middle East and sovereign demand helped boost the euro
overnight. Traders, however, said the currency will likely
struggle to rise further given option barriers in the $1.4250
area and strong resistance near $1.4280, the November high.
 Investors moved away from the low-yielding U.S. dollar as
world stocks advanced, spurring demand for riskier trades. That
helped the euro stay resilient even as Moody's downgraded 30
Spanish banks and pressure mounted on Portugal to seek a
bailout after the resignation of the country's prime minister.
 ""We think these are probably pretty good levels to start
shorting the euro,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president
of capital markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""This
Portugal situation is going to start to become a bigger deal.""
 The euro was last up 0.2 percent at $1.4114. It hit a low
of $1.4053 on trading platform EBS after Moody's downgraded 30
Spanish banks by one or more notches, though notably not the
biggest players, Santander and BBVA.
 Portugal's Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned on
Wednesday after parliament rejected his government's latest
austerity measures aimed at avoiding EU financial assistance.
 Socrates remains adamantly opposed to requesting aid from
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund and has
made it clear he intends to hold that line, at least until a
new Portuguese government is formed in the weeks ahead. Lisbon
needs to refinance 4.5 billion euros of sovereign debt in
April, which could trigger a request for aid.
 European leaders are unlikely to take a decision on how to
strengthen the euro zone's bailout fund at a summit on Thursday
and Friday, delaying the process until June, a development also
seen as negative for the euro.
 ""We think that no agreement at the EU summit on the bailout
facilities should erode euro support further in the near term.""
said Valentin Marinov, currency analyst at Citigroup.
 The euro could retrace all of its gains above the $1.40
mark, ""which materialized after the recent heads of state
meeting in mid-March,"" Marinov said.
 YIELD SUPPORT
 The euro was helped by semi-official and Middle Eastern
bids around the day's lows and macro account demand. More bids
from the Middle East were highlighted at $1.4010/20.
 The single currency was also helped by favorable yield
differentials as the European Central Bank is widely expected
to raise interest rates next month to counter inflation
pressures, even as U.S. rates are set to remain near zero.
 Data on Thursday showed new orders for long-lasting U.S.
manufactured goods fell in February, hinting at some unexpected
softness in manufacturing and business investment plans. See
 Some in the market question the ECB's intent to tighten
monetary policy at a time when some euro zone economies are
suffering, an issue that may haunt the euro in the future.
 The dollar was little changed at 80.94 yen. Market players
remained wary that Japan may intervene further if the dollar
drops below 80 yen, especially if such a move occurs in
volatile trade.
 Traders say Japanese exporters are likely to sell the
dollar on any rallies, helping keep the yen stuck in a thin
range against the dollar.

 By Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - A political crisis in
Portugal that has forced the resignation of its prime minister
will dominate a summit of EU leaders on Thursday, with Lisbon
under intense pressure to seek a bailout package.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned on Wednesday after
parliament rejected new austerity measures that his government
unveiled to avoid being forced to seek EU/IMF financial
assistance, as euro members Greece and Ireland did last year.
 Despite stepping down, Socrates is still attending the
two-day summit. He remains adamantly opposed to requesting aid
and has made it clear he intends to hold that line, at least
until a new Portuguese government is formed, which is expected
to take about two months.
 That has left Portugal in limbo and underscored the
political obstacles the single currency bloc faces in solving a
debt crisis that has steadily deepened over the past year.
 Only a few days ago, the two-day summit had been expected to
deliver a ""comprehensive package"" of new measures that would
reassure financial markets, but now leaders have been thrown
onto the defensive and could struggle to show unity and resolve.
 ""Socrates has to explain very clearly how he intends to
proceed in the next days,"" a senior euro zone source told
Reuters.
 ""Obviously it's not just the financial stability of Portugal
that is at stake but that of the whole euro zone. That's the
message other member states will deliver to Mr Socrates.""
 Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yields hit new highs on
Thursday, climbing to 7.90 percent, far above levels that
economists say would allow Lisbon to service its debt.
 The euro has remained strong through the latest bout of
turmoil, rising steadily for the past two months. It recovered
on Thursday after early weakness, trading at $1.4135.
 Lisbon needs to refinance about 4.5 billion euros of debt in
April and a similar amount in June, which may prove a trigger
for finally making the request for aid. One problem is that any
bailout request would have to be approved by parliament and the
majority is opposed to asking for help.
 If an aid package were to be requested -- and EU officials
have made clear they stand ready to provide one -- it is
estimated that Lisbon would need 60-80 billion euros.
 Asked if a bailout was likely, Eurogroup chief Jean-Claude
Juncker said: ""I do not exclude it"".
 
 UNRAVELLING?
 European leaders surprised markets with what looked like a
strong agreement at a March 11 meeting on a range of anti-crisis
measures that they were expected to rubber-stamp at the summit
this week. But key elements have been unravelling ever since.
 Draft conclusions drawn up ahead of the meeting showed a
decision on how to increase the effective lending capacity of
the bloc's current bailout fund -- the European Financial
Stability Facility -- would be delayed until mid-year, probably
ahead of a summit in late June.
 While a technical issue -- it centres on whether euro zone
member states will provide capital or guarantees to raise the
effective capacity of the EFSF from 250 billion euros to the
full 440 billion -- it risks further undermining market
confidence in EU policymakers' ability to resolve the crisis.
 Finland is the main obstacle to a decision, since it has
dissolved parliament ahead of elections on April 17 and cannot
therefore sign off on a deal. Helsinki opposes using more
guarantees to increase the effective size of the EFSF.
 A new Finnish government is only likely to be formed by May
at the earliest, and that government may include the eurosceptic
True Finns party, which opposes some of the EU's proposed crisis
steps, further complicating the outlook.
 Over the last few months, EU leaders have made considerable
progress in putting together the crisis package.
 They have decided in principle to expand the EFSF, agreed to
create a permanent crisis fund -- the European Stability
Mechanism -- to replace the EFSF from 2013, and agreed to
strengthen economic coordination and increase productivity.
 But as well as being unable to agree on exactly how the
EFSF's capacity should be increased, there are doubts about how
they will finance the 500 billion euro ESM using paid-in
capital, callable capital and guarantees.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel is demanding changes to an
ESM funding deal that her finance minister signed off on at the
start of the week.
 That deal would have limited her ability to push through tax
cuts before the next federal election in 2013 by obligating
Berlin to pay 11 billion euros into the ESM that year.
 While this is another nitty-gritty issue, it contributes to
a sense in financial markets that EU member states are endlessly
at odds over how best to handle the debt crisis.
 ""You have failed to give the markets a clear signal,"" former
German finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told Merkel in
parliament on Thursday morning. ""This shows that what we have in
Europe is a crisis of leadership, of credibility.""
 The summit is also unlikely to make progress on reducing the
interest rate on bailout loans extended to Ireland.
 Dublin says the rate is so high that it cripples the Irish
economy, but agreement on cutting it has been held up by
Dublin's refusal to give in to pressure for Ireland to raise its
low corporate tax rate and questions about whether Irish banks
may require more capital than previously thought.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded from an
early fall on Thursday on Middle-East and sovereign buying, with
worries over Portugal's political crisis and the health of the
Spanish banking system increasingly factored in to the currency.
 Still, traders say rallies are likely to be shallow and the
euro will struggle to rise past option barriers around $1.4250,
the level it hit on Tuesday for the first time since early
November.
 The euro was up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.4138 recovering
from a low of $1.4049 hit after Moody's said it had downgraded
30 Spanish banks by one or more notches, though notably not the
biggest players, Santander and BBVA.
 Also, Portugal's prime minister quit on Wednesday after
parliament rejected his government's latest austerity measures,
increasing the chances that the country will need a bailout..
 Market participants said the currency was growing resilient
in the face of a string of bad news with robust support at lower
levels from Asian central banks.
 ""The euro is becoming increasingly immune to issues
affecting the euro zone but the markets may be getting too blase
about the risks,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.
 News that European leaders are unlikely to take a decision
on how to strengthen the euro zone's bailout fund at a summit on
Thursday and Friday, delaying the process until June, was seen
as a key risk for the single currency.
 ""We think that no agreement at the EU summit on the bailout
facilities should erode EUR support further in the near term.""
said Valentin Marinov, currency analyst at CitiFX.
 ""Euro could retrace all of its gains above the $1.40 mark
which materialised after the recent heads of state meeting in
mid-March. Importantly, we doubt that this will trigger a
sell-off in the euro of the kind we saw in the summer of 2010.""
 
 FAVOURBALE RATE DIFFERENTIALS
 The euro was helped by semi-official and Middle Eastern bids
around the day's lows and macro account demand. More bids from
the Middle-East were highlighted at $1.4010/20.
 The single currency was underpinned by yield differentials
as euro zone interest rates are likely to rise in the near-term
to counter inflationary pressures, while U.S. rates are set to
remain low as its economy struggles.
 Danish bank Dankse recommended buying the euro at $1.4122
for a target of $1.46, with stops at $1.38. They argued negative
factors were ""not enough to trigger a trend reversal ... as the
support from relative monetary policy and global macro data
remains very strong.""
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark
was quoted on Thursday as saying that analysts have made the
correct assessment of the ECB's message when it stopped saying
that interest rates are appropriate.
 But some in the market question the ECB's intent to tighten
monetary policy at a time when some euro zone countries are
suffering from fiscal issues, an issue which may haunt the euro
in the future.
 With the euro higher, the dollar index, which measures the
dollar's value against a basket of currencies, was slightly
lower at 75.776.
 Against the yen, the dollar held steady from late U.S. trade
at 81.00 yen.
 Market players are wary that Japan may intervene further to
sell the yen if the dollar drops below 80 yen, and especially if
such a move occurs in volatile trade as was the case last week,
when the yen hit a post-war record high of 76.25 to the dollar
in the wake of a devastating earthquake and tsunami and a
nuclear crisis.
 At the same time, traders say Japanese exporters are likely
to sell the dollar on any rallies, helping keep the yen stuck in
a thin range against the dollar.

 EU BAILOUT
 The premium investors demand to hold Portuguese debt rather
than benchmark German Bunds hit euro-lifetime highs, while the
premium to hold other peripheral debt also rose, reflecting the
growing preference among bondholders to own higher-rated paper.
 Socrates and other Portuguese politicians continue to hold
out against the need for a financial bailout and are not

 Much of the anxiety over the euro zone's debt problems had
been soothed by the prospect of a longer-term reinforcement of
the EU bailout fund being agreed at the summit.
 But this has now been delayed until June, while Portugal
faces what are viewed as unsustainable borrowing costs ahead of
multi-billion euro bond repayments in April and June.
 The yield on 10-year Portuguese debt reached 7.9 percent,
leaving the premium to German government bonds around
euro-lifetime highs of 465 basis points.
 The euro  was last up 0.4 percent against the dollar
at $1.4145, having fallen earlier to a low of $1.4049.
 The yen itself was steady against the dollar at 80.90 yen
, although market players are still wary Japan may
intervene to sell the currency if the dollar breaches 80 yen.
 ""The euro is becoming increasingly immune to issues
affecting the euro zone but the markets may be getting too blase

 By Huw Jones
 LONDON, March 24 (Reuters) - The world's first recorded bank
panic dates back to Rome in AD 33, yet the intervening centuries
don't seem to have given top central bankers much to go on when
it comes to detecting how local risks and asset bubbles become
systemic, threatening the world economy.
 Everyone agrees the authorities need a macroprudential or
""bird's eye view"" of the risks, but no one knows how to get it,
partly because even the experts can't agree on what systemic
risks are. ""Systemic risk is an elusive concept,"" said the Bank
for International Settlements this month. ""It can have
significant economic consequences and is quantitatively
important, yet there is no clear consensus on how it should be
measured."" Some central bankers admit privately it may be
impossible to detect all bubbles.
 That's hardly encouraging, since addressing the problem is a
core element in the changes western central banks have been
called on to make. But this hasn't stopped bankers from trying:
fast-evolving new approaches are being foisted on an unwitting
public, even as central bankers themselves aren't entirely sure
how things will work.
 So far, all have created bodies with reassuring names: the
United States has a Financial Stability Oversight Council, the
EU has a European Systemic Risk Board, and Britain's Financial
Policy Committee is already up and running -- albeit in interim
form after it was set up this year. It has taken months to get
this far, a sign of how much it is still a work in progress.
 The committee, which must wait until 2012 for the
legislation needed to firm up its legal foundations, has an
agreed objective. Its broad remit is to ensure the financial
system stays resilient in the face of booms and busts, and any
actions it takes must not frustrate economic growth over the
medium to long term.
 Also decided is that the committee is based at the Bank of
England and chaired by the Bank's governor, Mervyn King, turning
him into one of the world's most powerful central bankers in
terms of responsibilities. It will meet at least four times a
year with publication of its deliberations and decisions.
Members include King's senior colleagues and four outsiders. It
will intervene in two ways: call for actual rule changes or
issue recommendations, which markets will interpret as warnings.
Or it will aim to ""take away the punchbowl"" in regulatory
parlance, to ensure credit is curbed before the financial party
gets out of hand.
 The committee is expected to spend much of its time issuing
policy recommendations to other bodies, such as the planned new
Financial Conduct Authority (which will partly replace the
Financial Services Authority next year) or the new Prudential
Regulation Authority, which adds another new responsibility for
the Bank of England in the supervision of major banks and
insurers. It could, for example, call for banks to reduce their
short-term liabilities, with a deadline.
 That all sounds simple enough, but some of the new
committee's tactics are far from from agreed. It will be given
its own set of tools or ""directive powers"", but what these will
be is still up for debate.
 Some, like FSA Chairman Adair Turner, say the new committee
could be allowed to cap the proportion of a property's value
that banks can lend, to cool overheated property markets. Many
central banks in Asia limit the proportion of deposits that
banks can extend as loans.
 Others argue the committee's role cannot include managing
the credit cycle -- for an unelected body to tell households how
much they can borrow would be a politically fraught endeavour,
these central bankers say. The aim is not to stop
over-borrowing, they argue, but to stop it from undermining the
financial system. A better approach would be to slap extra
capital charges on those banks that are willing to lend a higher
share.
 There's plenty of time to tackle the details. Between now
and the end of 2012, the committee and the government will
refine its remit and tools. ""That remit is likely to be more a
matter of words than a single number like the inflation target,
but it is the right approach to seek to set this out as
explicitly as possible,"" says Bank of England Chief Cashier
Andrew Bailey.
 Even if those details are agreed, they may mask a political
minefield. For instance, the committee wants the government to
say where the trade-off would lie between preserving the
stability of the financial system and threatening broader
economic growth by, say, curbing consumer demand.
 The committee's European counterpart is in a similar
situation: its chairman Jean-Claude Trichet said this month
macroprudential regulation is a new discipline with no template,
and the tools needed may take until the middle of this decade to
hone.
 And, of course, the British committee's effectiveness will
depend entirely on good links and perhaps even coordinated steps
with its counterparts in the United States and EU. This may not
be easy in practice, because even regulators are human.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2011 05:40AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-China central bank strives for more policy influence," This piece accompanies a Special Report on changes in central
banking.
 
 BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - Not a central bank in the
conventional Western mould, the People's Bank of China has
nevertheless emerged as a powerful player in steering the
world's second-largest economy as the decade-long term of its
governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, draws to a close.
 On the world stage, Zhou is beating the drum for the dollar
to be dethroned as the world's dominant currency. At home, the
Chinese central bank chief isn't sitting idle either.
 The central bank was pivotal in forging a consensus within
the Communist Party leadership that led to the landmark
revaluation of the yuan in 2005; similarly, analysts say the
central bank was the driving force behind Beijing's decision
last June to end a two-year peg to the dollar introduced to help
China weather the global financial crisis.
 The central bank has modernised China's domestic bond and
money markets, introducing a flurry of short-term instruments to
help it control money supply and guide market expectations.
 The bank, which constantly has to fend off attempts by other
state agencies to encroach on its turf, has also taken steps to
keep a tighter grip on bank lending. Traders and investors
around the world now hang on its every word and deed, even
though, ironically, Zhou can only dream of the powers enjoyed by
his foreign counterparts such as Ben Bernanke and Jean-Claude
Trichet.
 ""The People's Bank of China is playing a more and more
important role in the economy, although it's a fact that it
still enjoys little operational independence,"" said Qing Wang,
China economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong.
 Unlike Western central banks, the PBOC does not have the
final word on adjusting interest rates or the value of the yuan.
The basic course of monetary and currency policy is set by the
State Council, China's cabinet, or by the Communist Party's
ruling Politburo.
 Zhou made headlines in March 2009 by proposing to replace
the dollar eventually as the world's main reserve currency with
a beefed-up version of the the Special Drawing Right (SDR), the
International Monetary Fund's unit of account. The idea may be
premature, but Zhou is spearheading a programme to boost the use
of the yuan in trade and investment to ensure the currency
becomes a major component of the SDR.
 The quest for policy clout has sparked some turf battles.
 The PBOC was recently at odds with the National Development
and Reform Commission, the powerful planning agency, on targets
for bank lending and inflation.
 On the currency front, the central bank has been wrangling
with Commerce Ministry, a staunch defender of Chinese exporters,
over the pace of yuan appreciation. Zhou wants a stronger yuan
to help curb inflation; exporters, not surprisingly, are
opposed.
 The PBOC has only a short history as a true central bank.
Until 1983, it was also engaged in deposit-taking. The enactment
of the Law of the People's Bank of China in 1995 formalised its
central banking powers. It was also responsible for financial
supervision until the China Banking Regulatory Commission was
set up in 2003.
 Foreign central bankers speak highly of the PBOC's
technocrats. ""Compared with other major central banks, the
People's Bank of China is less independent, but it's increased
professionalism means more of its proposals will be endorsed by
the leadership,"" said an analyst at a state-owned bank who
declined to be named.
 Zhou, a well-trained economist and keen tennis player, has
promoted a number of influential Chinese scholars to senior
positions to beef up the central bank's management.
 Among them, deputy governor Yi Gang, who has a PhD in
economics from the University of Illinois, is tasked with
managing the country's $2.85 trillion foreign exchange reserves.
 Yi and China Construction Bank Chairman Guo Shuqing are
among the candidates to succeed Zhou, 63, who is due to retire
next year.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2011 05:36AM ET</span>",SPECIAL REPORT-The revolution in central banking," 
 IMPORTING INFLATION
 As if the political dimension was not enough of a headache,
central bank rate-setters seem to be finding it harder to nail
down the sources of the inflation they are tasked to fight. One
reason is globalisation.
 Central banks have traditionally turned a blind eye to a
one-off rise in prices stemming from, say, an increase in
consumption taxes, a sharp drop in the exchange rate that boosts
import costs or, as now, a spike in oil. As long as the price
jolt does not change inflationary expectations or worm its way
into the broader economy by prompting workers to ask for higher
wages, policy makers have usually felt comfortable in keeping
their eye on underlying cost pressures at home.
 That remains the consensus, as demonstrated by the Bank of
England, which has failed to keep inflation down to its 2
percent target for much of the past five years.
 But in a world of integrated supply chains, can inflationary
impulses be neatly attributed to either domestic or
international forces? Does it now make sense, as some analysts
argue, to estimate how much spare capacity there is globally,
not locally?
 The answers to those questions will have huge implications
for monetary policy.
 Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, one of six members of the ECB's
Executive, has warned that sharper rises in the prices of
commodities and goods imported from emerging economies will push
up euro zone inflation unless domestic prices are controlled. ""A
permanent and repeated increase in the prices of imported
products will tend to impact on inflation in the advanced
countries, including the euro area,"" he said in Bologna in
January.
 St. Louis Fed President James Bullard admits the United
States could not consider its own inflation outlook in complete
isolation from the rest of the world.
 ""Perhaps global inflation will drive U.S. prices higher or
cause other problems,"" he told a business breakfast in Kentucky
in February. The ties that bind global banks and the ease with
which capital flows across borders mean that central banks have
to be more aware than ever of the international consequences of
their policy actions.
 Because the dollar is the dominant world currency, the Fed
came under widespread fire for its second round of bond buying.
Critics in China and Brazil among others charged that dollars
newly minted by the Fed would wash up on their shores, stoking
inflation and pumping up asset prices.
 ""How do we conduct monetary policy in a globalised context?""
asks Richard Fisher, the Dallas Fed president. ""How do we
regulate and supervise and develop our peripheral vision for
those that we don't supervise in a formal way, in a globalised
context? Not easy.""
 Structural shifts in the world economy also raise questions
about how long central banks should give themselves to hit their
inflation goals -- further blurring the picture for investors.
 ""The central bank always has the choice of the time horizon
over which it hits its inflation target,"" Thygesen, the
Copenhagen professor, said. ""As the Bank of England is now
learning, it may have to extend that horizon somewhat in
particularly difficult circumstances. There may be good reasons
for doing it, but that is where the element of discretion lies.""
 The Bank of England expects inflation to remain above target
this year before falling back in 2012. The ECB, which seeks
medium-term price stability, is resigned to inflation remaining
above its target of just below 2 percent for most of 2011. In
the last 12 months, it stood at 2.3 percent.
 It all adds up to a significant shift in the environment in
which central banks operate. Policy-making is a whole lot more
complicated. With a broader mandate for keeping the banking
system safe comes increased political scrutiny. With
fast-expanding export economies like China becoming price
setters instead of price takers, offshore inflation and
disinflation are of growing importance. If the rise in oil
prices is due to increased demand from developing nations, for
instance, can western central banks still play down ever-higher
energy bills as transient? 
 That all means it will become tougher for central banks to
preserve their most precious asset, credibility.
 ""Look at the '90s and the early years of this century --
central banks were at the peak of their reputation worldwide,
and I was already saying at that time that we know from
experience that the risk is highest when you are on top,"" Issing
says. ""Central banks have to take care to restore their
reputation, if it has been lost. I think this is a difficult
situation for central banks worldwide.""

 * Lame duck Lisbon government unlikely to seek quick bailout

 * Final agreements on bailout fund may only come in June

(Releads, adds market movements, China comments)
 By Axel Bugge and Luke Baker
 LISBON/BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - The resignation of
Portugal's prime minister will dominate a summit of EU leaders
on the European economy on Thursday and Friday, with pressure
intense on Lisbon to seek a bailout package.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned on Wednesday after
parliament rejected his government's latest austerity measures
aimed at avoiding EU financial assistance. But he said he would
still attend the two-day summit in a caretaker capacity.
 Socrates remains adamantly opposed to requesting EU/IMF aid
and has made it clear he intends to hold that line, at least
until a new Portuguese government is formed in the weeks ahead.
 That leaves Portugal in limbo, but the likelihood remains
that a bailout will have to be taken in the end.
 Asked if Socrates would ask for aid at the summit, a senior
EU official said: ""I would be surprised. There is a doubt on
whether he has any mandate right now to do so ... But I would
not rule out.""
 Lisbon needs to refinance 4.5 billion euros of sovereign
debt in April, which may prove a trigger for finally making the
request for aid.
 One problem complicating Portugal's situation is that any
bailout request would have to be approved by parliament and the
majority is opposed to asking for help.
 ""I have always warned of the profoundly negative
consequences of seeking foreign aid,"" Socrates said as he
resigned, vowing to continue to do everything to avoid it.
 If aid were to be requested -- and EU officials have made
clear they stand ready to provide one -- it is estimated that
Lisbon would need 60-80 billion euros.
 Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yields rose further on
Thursday, climbing to 7.90 percent, far above the 7.0 percent
that is regarded as long-term sustainable.
 The euro weakened to $1.4070 from $1.4117.
 China, which has offered to buy Portuguese government debt
in the past, said it saw continued risks from the euro zone debt
crisis but added that it had increased its holdings of European
government bonds to help the region.
 
 SUMMIT PROBLEMS
 The summit, which was originally expected to sign off on a
""comprehensive package"" of measures that EU leaders thought
would help resolve their year-long debt problems, is now not
expected to take any firm decisions on central issues.
 ""We think that no agreement at the EU summit on the bailout
facilities should erode euro support further in the near term,""
said Valentin Marinov, currency analyst at CitiFX.
 Draft conclusions drawn up ahead of the summit showed that a
decision on how to increase the effective lending capacity of
the current bailout fund, the European Financial Stability
Facility, would not now be taken until mid-year, probably ahead
of a summit in late June.
 While a technical issue -- it centres on whether euro zone
member states will provide capital or guarantees to raise the
effective capacity of the EFSF from 250 billion euros to the
full 440 billion -- it risks further undermining market
confidence in EU policymakers' ability to resolve the crisis.
 Finland is one of the main obstacles to a decision, since it
has dissolved parliament ahead of elections on April 17 and
cannot therefore sign off on a deal. Helsinki opposes using more
guarantees to increase the effective size of the EFSF.
 A new Finnish government is only likely to be formed by May
at the earliest, and that government may include the eurosceptic
True Finns party, which opposes some of the EU's proposed crisis
steps, further complicating the outlook.
 Over the last few months, EU leaders have made considerable
progress in putting together the crisis package.
 They have decided in principle to expand the EFSF, agreed to
create a permanent crisis fund -- the European Stability
Mechanism -- to replace the EFSF from 2013, and agreed to
strengthen economic coordination and increase productivity.
 But as well as being unable to agree on exactly how the
EFSF's capacity should be increased, there are doubts about how
they will finance the 500 billion euro ESM using paid-in
capital, callable capital and guarantees.
 A German official said on Wednesday that Berlin now wanted
this week's summit to alter a timetable agreed by EU finance
ministers on Monday for injecting cash into the ESM.
 While this is another nitty-gritty issue, it contributes to
a sense in financial markets that EU member states are endlessly
at odds over how best to handle the debt crisis, and that
everything could yet unravel.
 
 NO MOVE ON IRELAND
 The summit is also unlikely to make progress on reducing the
interest rate on bailout loans extended to Ireland.
 Dublin says the rate is so high that it cripples the Irish
economy, but agreement on cutting it has been held up by
Dublin's refusal to give in to German and French pressure for
Ireland to raise its low corporate tax rate.
 ""There is almost certainly not going to be a resolution of
the Irish issues tomorrow or Friday,"" an EU diplomat said on
Wednesday.
 ""The feeling is that the outstanding issues for Ireland,
which are not just the interest rate but the banking question,
that they are better dealt with as a package.""
 Dublin and the EU are only expected to start detailed talks
on how to rescue the Irish banking system after the central bank
publishes its assessment of Irish commercial banks on March 31.

 * Surveys show prices rising sharply in euro zone
 * Composite PMI suggests Q1 growth of 0.8 percent
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, March 24 (Reuters) - The recovery in the euro zone's
dominant service sector accelerated slightly this month and
manufacturing saw solid growth, but both faced further pressure
from surging prices, PMI surveys showed on Thursday.
 The Flash Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers'
Index (PMI) nudged up to 56.9 in March from 56.8 the previous
month, its highest reading since August 2007 and confounding
expectations for a dip to 56.4.
 This is the 19th month the index, which measures the
activities of companies ranging from banks to hotels, has been
above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction.
 The flash manufacturing PMI fell to 57.7 this month from
59.0 in February, missing expectations for 58.4, while the
output index dropped to 58.9 from last month's 10-year high of
61.4.
 ""You expect to see some dips and dives when they are at
these sorts of heights so we are not particularly worried about
the downturn in the manufacturing index, it's still at levels
suggesting strong growth,"" said Chris Williamson at Markit.
 Earlier data from Germany showed a similar pattern while
France saw accelerating growth across the board.
 The euro zone composite PMI, a broader measure of the
private sector which combines the services and manufacturing
data, dropped to 57.5 from February's near five-year high of
58.2.
 The composite index is often used as a guide to growth and
Markit said it pointed towards a first quarter economic
expansion of 0.8 percent, with upside potential.
 Analysts polled by Reuters two weeks ago predicted first
quarter growth of just 0.5 percent for the euro zone economy.
 
 PRICE PRESSURES
 The input price index for the services sector rose to 60.6
this month from February's 58.4, its highest level since August
2008, as oil prices have soared with tensions in the Middle East
and North Africa heightening supply fears.
 The manufacturing sector's output price index rose to 61.4
from February's 60.8, the highest since the survey began
tracking the index in November 2002, suggesting producers were
able to pass on the increase in input prices.
 ""These are very worrying levels. It's feeding through the
supply chain, and it has originated from oil and food price
rises. Producers and suppliers are trying to pass those higher
energy costs on and they are getting increasingly successful at
doing that,"" Williamson said.
Official data showed prices rose 2.4 percent year-on-year in
the bloc last month, bolstering expectations that the European
Central Bank will raise interest rates when it meets in April.
 The ECB wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2
percent and signalled earlier in March that it may raise
interest rates in April, saying that it had to prevent
second-round effects from the oil price shock.
 Economists earlier this month adopted a new consensus,
forecasting an April rate rise, having earlier forecast interest
rates would not rise from their record low of 1.0 percent until
the fourth quarter of this year.
 Companies across the 17-nation bloc continued to take on
workers this month, albeit at a slighter slower pace than in
February, with the composite employment index slipping to 53.1
from a three-year high of 53.3 last month.
 Euro zone unemployment fell below 10 percent in January for
the first time since December 2009, coming in at 9.9 percent.

 SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro slipped
on Thursday, pulling further away from a 4-½ month high versus
the dollar on heightened worries that political instability in
Portugal may force it to become the latest country in the region
to seek a European Union bailout.
 The single currency slipped to the day's low of $1.4071 as
concerns about weakness in debt-heavy euro zone economies were
highlighted by a media report that ratings agency Moody's would
downgrade the credit ratings of Spanish banks on Thursday.
 Market participants said the euro could slide further to
$1.40 in the near term. Traders said light stop-loss orders were
creeping below that level on Thursday.

austerity measures aimed at avoiding a bailout. [ID:nLDE72M00L]
 ""If -- and this is a big if -- there is a bailout for
Portugal, the question would be how it would be negotiated with
a government in essentially a caretaker mode,"" said David
Forrester, currency strategist at Barclays Capital in Singapore.
 Many in the market anticipate Lisbon could appeal for a debt
bailout in the near future as the government struggles to
refinance its loans as yields rise.
 News that European leaders are unlikely to take a decision
on how to strengthen the euro zone's bailout fund until June
also weighed on the single currency. [ID:nLDE72M1E6]
 The euro  was little changed on the day at $1.4085,
having slipped as low as $1.4071. Traders said a further slide
had been stemmed by bank bids around the $1.4070 area.
 The euro has retreated after its rise earlier this week
stalled at $1.4249, its highest level since early November.
 ""We have seen the top in EUR/USD for now,"" said a trader at
a European bank in Singapore, adding he would sell into any
rally towards $1.4140 and add to short positions around $1.40.
 ""We will see it back to $1.3850 pretty soon on the back of
too much optimistic sentiment priced into the euro.""
 The mid-$1.3850 region is considered key support, given that
the single currency rose to $1.3862 in early February during a
sharp rally at the start of the year. It later pulled back
before embarking on its latest climb.
 Above that, the euro could be cushioned in the $1.4015-55
area, which contains a series of intraday highs hit earlier this
month.
 Some analysts say the euro is unlikely to enter a protracted
downtrend at this point, given expectations the European Central
Bank will raise interest rates as early as April.
 This would support the single currency as it would boost its
rate differential against the dollar and other lower-yielding
currencies.
 But others in the market question the ECB's intent to
tighten monetary policy at a time when some euro zone countries
are suffering from fiscal issues, an issue which may haunt the
euro in the future.
 DOLLAR SUPPORTED
 The euro's latest drop gave some reprieve to the dollar.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, edged up 0.2 percent to 75.936 <.DXY>,
clinging to the gains it made on Wednesday.
 Against the yen, the dollar held steady from late U.S. trade
at 81.00 yen .
 Market players are wary that Japan may intervene further to
sell the yen if the dollar drops below 80 yen, and especially if
such a move occurs in volatile trade as was the case last week,
when the yen hit a post-World War Two record high of 76.25 to
the dollar.
 At the same time, traders say Japanese exporters are likely
to sell the dollar on any rallies, helping keep the yen stuck in
a thin range against the dollar. Traders cited some selling
demand from Japanese exporters around the 81.00 level.
 Some argued that the longer the dollar hovers above 80 yen
ahead of Japan's fiscal year end next week, the more exporters
may be forced to lower their dollar-selling offers, which may
see the U.S. currency weaken in the coming days.
 Sterling was flat at $1.6230 , on the backfoot after
it fell on Wednesday when the British government cut its growth
forecasts and said borrowing would fall more slowly than hoped.

 * Rise expected after state increased fuel, power prices	
 * Economists expect further monetary tightening in Q2	
 * Trade deficit $1.15 bln in March -state-run news website	

(Recasts, adds trade data)	
 HANOI, March 24 (Reuters) - Vietnam's consumer price index
in March recorded its biggest annual increase in 25 months,
leaping 13.89 percent from the same month last year, despite
monetary tightening and plans for scaled back fiscal spending.	
 Economists said the persistence of upward price pressure
could spur the central bank to increase key interest rates in
the second quarter.	
 The government's General Statistics Office said consumer
prices in March rose 2.17 percent from February, the biggest
monthly rise since May 2008, on the back of hikes in fuel and
electricity prices set by the state as well as higher food
prices.	
 Macroeconomic instability has been a major concern for
investors in Vietnam and played a part in decisions by the three
major ratings agencies to downgrade Vietnam last year. The
country suffers one of Asia's highest inflation rates.	
 The government last month unveiled a package of measures to
curb inflation, trim the trade deficit and shore up a
depreciating currency, including raising several interest rates
and cutting credit growth targets.	
 Inflationary momentum was easing but the CPI will peak
around the middle of the year, Barclays Capital economists
Prakriti Sofat and Krishna Hegde wrote in a note.	
 ""We remain bearish on inflation in the near term, expecting
the headline rate to rise to 16-17 percent y/y by mid-year,""
they said.	
 
 
 
 DOUBLE-DIGIT HIKES	
 HSBC also expects inflation to remain high, even while it
said the March increase was not a surprise after a 15.3 percent
increase in electricity prices at the start of the month and
double-digit hikes in fuel prices in late February.	
 ""We expect inflation to pick up further in coming months
amid surging global food and oil prices, especially since the
Vietnamese government has recently appeared more inclined to let
end-users bear the cost,"" HSBC economist Sherman Chan said.	
 During the second quarter, key interest rates could be
increased by 200 basis points, both banks said.	
 Meanwhile, Vietnam's trade deficit was forecast to hit $1.15
billion during March, according to news reports quoting data
from the statistics office. An official at the office declined
to confirm the trade data, which is expected to be released
publicly before the end of the month.	
 Exports increased 26 percent in March from a year earlier to
$7.05 billion, while imports expanded 21.5% from March 2010 to
$8.2 billion, the news website VNEconomy.vn reported.	
 VNEconomy.vn is the online version of the Vietnam Economic
Times.	
 A report in the state-run Tuoi Tre daily citing Vietnam
customs data said the trade deficit would drop to about $700
million this month.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2011 02:29AM ET</span>",Ships may avoid Tokyo port on radiation concerns-industry," By Chikako Mogi and Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE/TOKYO, March 24 (Reuters) - Some merchant ships
may be avoiding Japan's Tokyo port due to concerns of radiation
exposure to crew members from the quake-crippled Fukushima
nuclear plant, an industry official said on Thursday.	
 ""I have heard from local agents that some vessels are not
calling in Tokyo due to radiation fears. I'm not sure how many,""
said Tetsuya Hasegawa, operating manager at Heisei Shipping
Agencies in Tokyo.	
 He said he could not name any specific companies that have
diverted their vessels from Tokyo's port, located 250 km (150
miles) south of the Fukushima nuclear plant.	
 Lloyd's List reported on Thursday that Claus-Peter Offen,
one of Germany's largest shipowners, had suspended calls for his
company's entire fleet of 110 vessels to Tokyo and Yokohama
because of radiation fears.	
 Should this be the beginning of a trend in the shipping
industry, Japan could face major delays and seaborne congestion
at ports, adding to supply chain bottlenecks and hindering
recovery efforts in the wake of the March 11 earthquake.	
 Nearly two weeks after the disaster, the world's third
largest economy is grappling with threats from radiation leaks
as Tokyo's 13 million people were told not to give infants tap
water. 
 Tokyo is Japan's fourth largest port, handling 145 million
deadweight tonnes last year, mainly containers, according to
Lloyd's List Intelligence.	
 Officials with the Japanese Shipowners' Association and
other shipping firms could not confirm any ships being diverted
from Tokyo.	
 ""We are aware of such talk, but there is no such evidence
that we know of,"" said an official at a major Japanese shipping
firm.	
 Japan's port infrastructure was left largely unscathed by
the earthquake with around 15 severely damaged.	
 Twelve of those ports were already usable for recovery
efforts and general use, the country's transport minister said
on Wednesday.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2011 02:01AM ET</span>",Q+A-Can Japan handle huge relief and reconstruction costs?," By Tomasz Janowski	
 TOKYO, March 24 (Reuters) - Japan faces a mammoth disaster
relief and reconstruction effort after a powerful earthquake and
tsunami devastated the country's northeast, leaving more than
25,000 dead or missing and triggering a nuclear crisis.	
 The government, which has been juggling relief work with a
race to avert a catastrophic meltdown at a crippled nuclear
plant, has yet to decide how much it will spend for its biggest
rebuilding effort since the post-World War Two reconstruction.	
 The following are questions and answers about the fiscal
strain of the relief and reconstruction effort and its possible
market implications.	
 
 WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE?	
 The government's first estimate released on Wednesday puts
the damage to roads, homes, factories and other infrastructure
at around $200-310 billion, or up to 6 percent of Japan's GDP,
making it the world's costliest natural disaster.	
 In addition, there are harder-to-gauge losses in economic
activity from planned power outages or the broader impact of the
nuclear crisis.	
 
 HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT SPEND?	
 Much of the cost will be borne by households and companies,
though the government is likely to take the lion's share, paying
for relief efforts and reconstruction of the worst-hit areas,
soft loans and tax breaks for businesses hit by the disaster and
capital injections for banks in the area.	
 Lawmakers are talking of extra budgets totalling between 5
and 10 trillion yen ($124 billion) in addition to a regular 92
trillion yen budget. 
 
 WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM?	
 Immediate rescue and relief efforts have been financed by
emergency reserves in this fiscal year's budget and those in the
next budget that takes force on April 1 will be used too. Later,
at least two, maybe more, additional emergency budgets will be
needed, ruling party officials say. The first would focus on
urgent needs and could be financed largely by savings in the
main budget.	
 The ruling Democratic party lawmakers have suggested
dropping some of their spending plans to save about 220 billion
yen and the opposition has called for cuts of up to 3.6 trillion
yen. Still, much of the funding will have to be covered by
borrowing, though there are other options. An idea of a special
relief tax has been floated, though so far the government has
dismissed it. In the longer-term, Japan could also tap some of
its $1 trillion foreign reserves.	
 
 CAN JAPAN BORROW MUCH MORE?	
 Despite a ballooning debt of twice the size of its $5
trillion economy and some doomsday predictions of a fiscal
meltdown, Japan has had so far little difficulty borrowing at
rates just above 1 percent , below rates of over 3
percent paid on 10-year U.S. and German government debt.	
 Japan's vast pool of domestic savings, well in excess of the
size of the debt, and the fact that it sells 95 percent of its
bonds at home help explain the paradox.	
 Moody's ratings agency said on Monday Japan had the credit
and fiscal means to deal with the disaster, even though risks to
the economy have increased since the March 11
disaster. 
 Economists warn that in the long-run a declining savings
rate of a rapidly ageing population will leave Tokyo relying
more on fickle foreign investors, but say such a tipping point
is probably several years, if not decades, away.	
 
 CAN JAPAN AVOID HIGHER BORROWING COSTS?	
 A debt crisis similar to one engulfing the euro zone
periphery seems a distant possibility now. But some analysts say
selling by nervous foreigners and Japanese investors needing
cash to deal with the destruction could still push up bond
yields enough to cause policymakers a headache.	
 Therefore, the government may look for other ways to borrow
rather than just ramp up bond sales. One option suggested by
media and rejected off hand by policymakers, would be for the
Bank of Japan to underwrite a large issue of disaster bonds.	
 A more palatable solution for the central bank would be to
increase bond purchases from the market to limit the impact of
increased supply.	
 Yet another option would be for public or semi-public
financial institutions to take up special reconstruction bonds.
A credit line from a multinational institution such as the IMF
or World Bank, though not discussed so far, could also be a
possibility.	
 Finally, some economists are suggesting that Japan could use
part of its foreign reserves to create a sovereign wealth fund
to finance long-term reconstruction. This, however, is the most
far-fetched option as it would require significant changes to
law to make it possible. 
 
 HOW SOON CAN AN EMERGENCY BUDGET BE PASSED?	
 Democratic party secretary-general Katsuya Okada said this
week the first emergency budget could be released in April or
May. Savings that are made to finance it could also help win
opposition support needed to pass a key bill that allows the
government to issue new bonds needed to finance the regular
budget and emergency packages. Before the disaster, the
opposition was blocking this and other bills to force the deeply
unpopular Prime Minister Naoto Kan to call a snap election, but
the crisis has raised chances that the impasse will end.

 * No evidence of damage from Japan supply chain disruptions

 * Data seen easing concerns about China slowdown
 * Final PMI data due next week
(Add details)	
 BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - China's factories stepped up a
gear this month and inflationary pressure ebbed, a survey showed
on Thursday, suggesting the manufacturing giant had yet to feel
much fallout from Japan's devastating earthquake.	
 Japan is China's biggest source of imports, which include
high-tech products used in the manufacture of electronics and
autos, so government officials have warned they expect some
impact to trade.	
 The HSBC flash manufacturing purchasing managers' index
(PMI), the earliest available indicator of China's industrial
activity, rose to a two-month high of 52.5 in March, up from a
final reading of 51.7 in February. 
 A figure above 50 points to expansion on the month.	
 Designed to provide a preview of final PMI data, which is
due at the end of next week, the survey indicated that the
government had made some progress in taming inflation without
unduly harming growth. A sub-index measuring output prices fell
to its lowest in seven months.	
 ""This should reduce concerns about a sharp slowdown in
growth,"" Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief China economist, said in a
statement.	
 ""Meanwhile, the increase in both input and output prices
sub-indices started to slow, implying Beijing's policy
tightening is working to contain inflationary pressures without
choking off growth,"" he added.	
 
 
 JAPAN DISASTER	
 Fears are mounting about the impact of Japan's earthquake
and subsequent power shortages on global supply chains, but the
flash PMI displayed no evidence of significant disruptions in
China.	
 Most firms responded to the survey after the disaster struck
Japan on March 11. PMI data was collected up to March 22.	
 Still, the strong flash PMI hardly signals the all-clear for
the world's second-biggest economy that grew more than 10
percent last year. 
 One possibility is that firms had big enough inventories to
cushion the blow from Japan's lost production and it will take a
while longer for the damage to show up.	
 The Chinese commerce ministry has said that Japan's
earthquake and tsunami are likely to have a limited, temporary
impact on bilateral trade. 
 
 SLOWER INFLATION	
 While Japan has inflamed worries about global manufacturing,
political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa has pushed
up oil prices. But these troubles have dented the costs of most
other commodities.	
 The net effect appears to have been an easing of China's
imported inflationary pressure as the flash sub-index of input
prices fell to its lowest level in half a year.	
 The drop in inflationary pressure also partly reflects
monetary tightening by the Chinese government. Since October,
the central bank has increased banks' reserve requirements six
times -- most recently on Friday -- and raised interest rates
three times. 
 ""We expect Beijing to keep tightening in the coming months.
Combined with supply-side cooling measures, this should slow
inflation meaningfully by the middle of the year,"" Qu said.	
 Consumer price inflation in February was 4.9 percent,
unchanged from January. 
 The flash PMI, compiled by British research firm Markit, is
based on up to 90 percent of total responses to the monthly
survey and is designed to be an accurate snapshot of the final
data, which is usually released on the first working day of
every month.	
 This is the second month that HSBC has published a flash PMI
for China. In February, the flash reading was 51.5, which turned
out to be 0.2 points lower than the final figure.

 BALTIMORE, March 23 (Reuters) - Controversies involving
Kosovo's prime minister and president will not deter investment
interest in the newest Balkan country, deputy prime minister
Mimoza Kusari-Lila said on Wednesday.	
 Businesses will look at whether Kosovo's institutions and
legislative operations are functioning well and working towards
improving economic growth, Kusari-Lila told Reuters on the
sidelines of a Balkan investment summit in Baltimore.	
 She contends investors will not focus on a December report
by the Council of Europe's Human Rights watchdog that said Prime
Minister Hashim Thaci headed a mafia-style crime organization in
1999-2000.	
 ""We need to make sure that we present facts and figures and
not story tales about what happened 11 years ago or 12 years
ago,"" Kusari-Lila said. ""The entire nation cannot be kept
hostage by a history from when they were a victim.""	
 Thaci, elected in December, has rejected Council of Europe
rapporteur Dick Marty's report, now the subject of a European
Union probe, as untrue. It accused members of the former Kosovo
Liberation Army loyal to Thaci of abductions, gun- and
drug-running and trafficking in organs from some ethnic Serbs in
1999-2000.	
 Kusari-Lila said there is no evidence to support Marty's
report. She also said Kosovo's new president Behgjet Pacolli's
controversial business ties to the Kremlin are part of the past.	
 These are not Kosovo's biggest public relations problem, she
insisted. Kosovo's biggest concern is showing that it can
sustain economic growth and create jobs.	
 ""If someone wants to bring up prejudice and bring up more
obstacles to Kosovo's integration and Kosovo's development, then
yes, they can find excuses, but I don't think that's a real
problem. I think the main issue for Kosovo is to show that
policies, legislation and institutions function,"" she said.	
 A bigger barrier to investment is the lack of movement of
goods, people and money between Kosovo and Serbia, Kusari-Lila
said, adding that she was hopeful that technical talks now
underway between the two states could alleviate such pressures.	
 Ultimately, private businesses will base their decisions on
the country's economic performance, the opportunities they see
and the quality of their business partner, said Kusari-Lila, who
also serves as trade and industry minister.	
 None of the American firms speaking with her at the
Baltimore conference asked about the prime minister or the
president, she said.	
 ""They want to know more about legislation, they want to know
more about business opportunities and they want to know more
about what the government can do to assist them so they can come
and locate in Kosovo.""	
 The deputy prime minister also said that talks with the
International Monetary Fund over Thaci's decision to raise
public sector wages by up to 50 percent were continuing. The
decision earlier this month violates terms of a 108 million-euro
IMF stand-by loan arrangement.	
 She said the talks were not expected to be concluded before
the IMF spring meetings in Washington in April.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Naomi Tajitsu
 SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell on
Thursday, pulling further away from a 4-½ month high versus
the dollar on heightened worries that heavily indebted Portugal
will require a bailout from the European Union.
 The single currency slipped to the day's low as concerns
about weakness in debt-addled euro zone countries were
highlighted by a media report that ratings agency Moody's would
downgrade the credit ratings of Spanish banks on Thursday.
 Keeping the euro under selling pressure was the resignation
of Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates on Wednesday after
Portugal's parliament rejected his government's latest austerity
measures aimed at avoiding a bailout. [ID:nLDE72M00L]
 News that European leaders are unlikely to take a decision
on how to strengthen the euro zone's bailout fund until June
also weighed on the single currency. [ID:nLDE72M1E6]
 Players said the single currency could see a further
correction in the near-term and possibly test levels around
$1.40. Traders said light stop-loss orders were creeping below
that level.
 ""Over the past week or so, the euro had been bought
persistently, rising from around $1.38 to above $1.42 with quite
a bit of momentum,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for Okasan
Securities' foreign securities department in Tokyo.
 ""I wouldn't be surprised if there was a bit more of a
pullback,"" Soma said, adding that the euro could drop to about
$1.40 in the near-term.
 The euro hovered around a session low of $1.4075, trading
flat on the day. Traders said a further slide had been stemmed
by bank bids around the $1.4070 area.
 The euro has retreated after its rise earlier this week
stalled at $1.4249, its highest level since early November.
 ""We have seen the top in EUR/USD for now,"" said a trader at
a European bank in Singapore, adding he would sell into any
rally towards $1.4140 and add to short positions around $1.40.
 ""I think we will see it back to $1.3850 pretty soon on the
back of too much optimistic sentiment priced into the euro.""
 The mid-$1.3850 region is considered key support, given that
the single currency rose to $1.3862 in early February during a
sharp rally at the start of the year. It later pulled back
before embarking on its latest climb.
 Above that, the euro could be cushioned in the $1.4015-55
area, which contains a series of intraday highs hit earlier this
month.
 Some analysts say the euro is unlikely to enter a protracted
downtrend at this point, given expectations the European Central
Bank will raise interest rates as early as April.
 This would support the single currency as it would boost its
rate differential against the dollar and other lower-yielding
currencies.
 But others in the market question the ECB's intent to
tighten monetary policy at a time when some euro zone countries
are suffering from fiscal issues, an issue which may haunt the
euro in the future.
 DOLLAR SUPPORTED
 The euro's latest drop gave some reprieve to the dollar.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, edged up 0.2 percent to 75.958 <.DXY>,
clinging to the gains it made on Wednesday.
 Against the yen, the dollar held steady from late U.S. trade
at 81.00 yen .
 Market players are wary that Japan may intervene further to
sell the yen if the dollar drops below 80 yen, and especially if
such a move occurs in volatile trade as was the case last week,
when the yen hit a post-World War Two record high of 76.25 to
the dollar.
 At the same time, traders say Japanese exporters are likely
to sell the dollar on rallies, helping keep the yen stuck in
range-trading against the dollar. Some cited demand from
exporters around the 81.00 level on Thursday.
 Sterling was flat at $1.6240 , trimming losses after
it fell on Wednesday after the British government cut its growth
forecasts and said borrowing would fall more slowly than hoped.

 LISBON, March 24 (Reuters) - Portuguese Prime Minister Jose
Socrates resigned on Wednesday after parliament rejected his
government's latest austerity measures, designed to help
Portugal avoid having to seek an international bailout.
[ID:nLDE72M00L] 
 
 IS A BAILOUT INEVITABLE?
 It looks likely. At around 7.8 percent, Portugal's 10-year
government bond yield  is well above the 7 percent
level which many analysts think is unsustainable in the long
term. The five-year yield  is even higher; similar
inversions in the yield curve were seen for Greece and Ireland
before they sought bailouts last year.
 After the rejection of the austerity measures, Portuguese
yields could rise further unless a new government quickly comes
up with a fresh austerity package -- but forming a new
government could take many weeks.
 Socrates and his Socialists firmly opposed a bailout, which
would carry tough fiscal conditions; Portugal has bad memories
of IMF-ordered austerity in the 1980s. But the main opposition
Social Democrats (PSD) have not ruled out seeking international
aid. PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho has indicated he would seek
political cover for any bailout by blaming the last government
for it. Other, smaller parties are mostly against a bailout.
 Rich euro zone states such as Germany have been pressing
Portugal to seriously consider a bailout, as a way of removing a
major source of market instability in the euro zone. They could
increase their pressure if Portuguese yields keep rising.
 ""The prospect of a bailout has risen drastically and is now
enormous,"" said Filipe Garcia, head of Informacao de Mercados
Financeiros consultants in Porto.
 
 WHEN WOULD A BAILOUT OCCUR?
 Portugal has 4.3 billion euros of bonds coming due on April
15, and a further 4.9 billion euros in June; the weeks before
these redemptions would be logical times to take a bailout.
 But if Portugal retains access to the debt market to
refinance those bonds, and is willing to accept very high
yields, it may be able to avoid taking a bailout for many more
months; after June, it will face no more bond redemptions this
year.
 A delay in forming a new government would not necessarily
delay a bailout, some political analysts said.
 ""Although a caretaker government cannot take major
autonomous initiatives, it could take a decision on resorting to
aid if it is backed by parliament,"" said analyst Antonio Costa
Pinto.
 
 HOW LARGE WOULD A BAILOUT BE?
 An official euro zone source estimated in January that were
Portugal to ask for international aid, it might need between 60
and 80 billion euros.
 Together, the euro zone's bailout fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility, and the International Monetary
Fund could provide those amounts comfortably -- even if a
planned expansion of the EFSF is held up by wrangling among
European governments.
 
 WHEN WILL PORTUGAL HAVE A NEW GOVERNMENT?
 Socrates presented his resignation to President Anibal
Cavaco da Silva, who said he would hold meetings with all
political parties on Friday and that the government would retain
full powers at least until then.
 Cavaco Silva could ask the parties to agree on a new prime
minister and a coalition government without calling an election,
but a consensus on this is unlikely to be reached as Socrates
and Passos Coelho have indicated a general election would be the
most legitimate solution to the stand-off.
 So Cavaco Silva will probably ask the state advisory council
and the heads of the parties to discuss dissolving parliament
and calling snap elections. These can be held 55 days after they
are called, at the earliest.
 In the meantime, the government would stay on as a caretaker
administration, its functions reduced to strictly necessary
management of public matters.
 
 HOW WOULD ELECTIONS PAN OUT?
 The PSD has been ahead in opinion polls for several months
with around 35-38 percent of voting intentions, but it has
rarely neared the threshold needed to win an absolute majority.
 Analysts say the Socialist election machine should not be
underestimated. Socrates, an experienced and fierce campaigner,
has said he would stand in a new election. His party still has
around 25-30 percent of voting intentions in recent polls and
could still thwart the PSD.
 If it won, the PSD could try to revive a coalition with the
CDS-PP to have a stable majority to pass legislation; it has
signalled it would favour a broad coalition.
 In the current parliament, the Socialists have 97 seats, 19
short of the number needed to approve legislation on their own.
The PSD has 81 seats, followed by CDS-PP's 21. The Left Bloc has
16 seats and the Communist-Greens alliance holds 15.
 
 HOW DOES THE PSD DIFFER FROM THE SOCIALISTS?
 The centre-right PSD denounced Socrates' latest austerity
measures as arbitrary, poorly thought out and too harsh towards
pensioners, but it supports the idea of cutting the budget
deficit and may simply have used the controversy over the latest
measures to force a crisis that could give it power.
The PSD has said it will stick to Portugal's commitments to
the EU, made by the Socialist government, to cut the deficit to
2.0 percent of gross domestic product in 2013 from a projected
4.6 percent this year.
 Some analysts believe the PSD could ultimately prove more
aggressive in reforming Portugal's public finances than the
Socialists.

(Adds graphic link, comment)	
 By Mantik Kusjanto	
 WELLINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand's economy grew
marginally in the fourth quarter, narrowly avoiding a slip back
into recession and backing the central bank's decision to cut
interest rates after February's devastating Christchurch
earthquake.	
 ""The focus now is on how quickly economic activity rebounds
from first quarter weakness,"" said Goldman Sachs economist
Philip Borkin, who expects the central bank to resume tightening
policy again early next year.	
 Gross domestic product (GDP) rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2
percent in the Oct-Dec quarter, following a 0.2 percent
contraction in the period ended Sept 30, which was the first dip
in six quarters, according to official data on Thursday.	
 Economists polled by Reuters had a median forecast for a 0.1
percent rise on the previous quarter and a rise of 0.8 percent
compared to a year ago.	
 The backward-looking data has been overshadowed by the
strong earthquake which struck New Zealand's second-largest city
last month, killing at least 166 people.	
 It was the second quake to hit Christchurch and the
surrounding region since early September, further dimming the
near-term growth outlook. 
 Initial estimates have put the cost of the damage quakes as
high as NZ$15 billion ($11 billion), about 7 percent of GDP.	
 But growth is expected to pick up over the next two years,
boosted by reconstruction. 
 ""The actions of the Reserve Bank have been in anticipation
of further poor news and this relates to the first quarter
rather than the fourth quarter. So policy has taken care of the
downside risk,"" said UBS senior economist Robin Clements.	
 The New Zealand dollar rose to $0.7420 from around
$0.7400 before the data, while interest rate futures <0#NBB:>
were up to three points lower.

 New Zealand's economy has struggled since it emerged from
its longest recession in more than 30 years in the June quarter
of 2009. The housing market and retail sales have been sluggish,
with unemployment rising and wage growth weak, factors which
have overshadowed benefits from a solid rebound in exports on
higher commodity prices.	
 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut its growth forecast
for the year ending March 31 to 0.9 percent from 1.7 percent,
and its projection for the year ending March 2012 to 2.7 percent
from 3.4 percent.	
 
 OUTLOOK	
 The small expansion in the fourth quarter was driven by
stronger manufacturing, construction, fishing and forestry
sectors, offsetting falls in the wholesale and retail sectors.	
 Domestic consumption, which makes up around 60 percent of
the economy, rose 0.2 percent, the seventh consecutive quarter
of growth, albeit at low levels.	
 Inventories also had the largest build-up since the series
began in June 1987.	
 Consumers have been cautious about spending in the face of
subdued wage growth and high unemployment, and they have been
rushing to reduce debt.	
 The economy is expected to pick up some pace later this year
when New Zealand will host the Rugby World Cup, with tourism
expected to add some NZ$700 million to the economy, or 0.3
percent of GDP.	
 The RBNZ slashed its interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.5
percent earlier this month to restore confidence and cushion the
economy after the latest quake.	
 The majority of analysts in a recent Reuters poll believe
the central bank will keep rates unchanged until the first
quarter of 2012. A minority said that tightening will be needed
before the end of the year to cope with strong growth and the
emergence of strong inflationary pressures. 
 Financial markets' expectations were unchanged after the
data, with traders pricing in 38 bps of tightening over the 12
months because of the subdued economy.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 SINGAPORE, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro struggled on
Thursday but could pull back further from a recent 4-½ month
high on heightened worries that heavily indebted Portugal will
require a bailout from the European Union.
 The euro was knocked lower the previous day when Portuguese
Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned after Portugal's
parliament rejected his government's latest austerity measures
aimed at avoiding a bailout. [ID:nLDE72M00L]
 News that European leaders are unlikely to take a decision
on how to strengthen the euro zone's bailout fund until June,
also weighed on the single currency. [ID:nLDE72M1E6]
 Although the euro regained a bit of ground in early Asian
trade on Thursday, market players said the single currency could
see a further correction in the near-term and possibly test
levels around $1.40.
 ""Over the past week or so, the euro had been bought
persistently, rising from around $1.38 to above $1.42 with quite
a bit of momentum,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for Okasan
Securities' foreign securities department in Tokyo.
 ""I wouldn't be surprised if there was a bit more of a
pullback,"" Soma said, adding that the euro could drop to about
$1.40 in the near-term.
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.4106 , having
trimmed some losses after shedding 0.8 percent on Wednesday. The
euro has retreated after its rise earlier this week stalled at
$1.4249, its highest level since early November.
 Soma at Okasan Securities added, however, that the euro
seems unlikely to enter a protracted downtrend at this point.
 Market expectations that the European Central Bank will
raise interest rates soon are likely to lend support to the
euro, Soma said. Investors are bracing for the possibility that
the ECB may raise interest rates as early as April.
 The euro's latest drop gave some reprieve to the dollar.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, stood at 75.841 <.DXY> and clung to the
gains it made on Wednesday, when it rose 0.6 percent.
 Against the yen, the dollar held steady from late U.S. trade
on Wednesday at 80.92 yen .
 Market players are wary that Japan may intervene further to
sell the yen if the dollar drops below 80 yen, and especially if
such a move occurs in volatile trade as was the case last week,
when the yen hit a post-World War Two record high of 76.25 to
the dollar.
 At the same time, traders say Japanese exporters are likely
to sell the dollar on rallies, helping keep the yen stuck in
range-trading against the dollar.
 Sterling edged up 0.1 percent to $1.6265 , trimming
a bit of losses after it fell on Wednesday after the British
government cut its growth forecasts and said borrowing would
fall more slowly than hoped.
 Minutes from the last Bank of England review showed
policymakers were less hwakish than some market watchers had
expected, also contributing to the sterling's fall on Wednesday,
when it shed 0.8 percent. [ID:nLDE72M0W6]

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, March 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell and oil eased
on Thursday after Portugal's prime minister resigned following
parliament's rejection of his minority government's austerity
programme, renewing worries about the scale of the euro zone's
sovereign debt crisis.	
 Asian stocks outside Japan rose as higher commodities prices
lifted materials shares, but Tokyo shares weakened as concerns
over radiation leaks from an earthquake-damaged nuclear power
plant continued to sap investor confidence.	
 European shares were expected to open little
changed as uncertainty over Portugal, Japan and the Middle
East gave investors little incentive to stake out fresh
positions, while U.S. S&P 500 futures barely budged,
pointing to a cautious start on Wall Street as well. 
 The resignation of Prime Minister Jose Socrates was seen as
increasing the likelihood that Portugal will join Greece and
Ireland in requiring a bailout from the European Union.

 An official euro zone source estimated in January that if
Portugal asked for international aid, it might need between 60
billion to 80 billion euros (up to $113 billion).	
 ""Whether there will be a bailout for Portugal or not has
some consequences on how things will pan out in Europe. Risks in
the euro-zone seem to be increasing,"" said Serene Lim, a
Singapore-based oil analyst at ANZ Bank.	
 
 Tokyo's Nikkei fell 0.2 percent. It remains 8
percent below its close on March 11, when a 9.0 magnitude
earthquake and tsunami hit northeastern Japan, leaving around
25,600 people dead or missing and cutting power to millions of
homes as well as factories, many of which are still struggling
to come back online. 
 The estimated $300 billion in damage makes it the costliest
natural disaster in history, and Japan is still grappling with
the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl after the quake and
tsunami crippled a power plant 240 km (150 miles) north of
Tokyo.	
 ""We are unlikely to see further gains in the near future,
unless there's an end to the nuclear crisis in sight,"" said
Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities. 
 Disruptions in the global supply chain after the Japan quake
continue to be felt around the world, most notably for auto
makers and electronics firms. Toyota Motor said
overnight it will slow some North American production because of
parts shortages.	
 MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.9 percent, with Australia's
resources-heavy index gaining 1 percent after a rally in
prices of base metals such as copper the previous day.	
 Gains for materials shares lifted Wall Street on Wednesday,
with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 0.6 percent
and the broader S&P 500 gaining 0.3 percent. 
 
 DEBT CRISIS	
 The political upheaval in Portugal, along with looming
elections elsewhere, was expected to deter European leaders from
taking tough decisions to address the region's sovereign debt
crisis when they meet at a summit this week.	
 They are unlikely to come up with a plan to strengthen the
euro zone's bailout fund until June, which may also undermine
the single currency. 
 ""If the EU leaders fail to come up with measures to enhance
the safety net that markets have wanted in their summit meeting,
the euro could face further pressure down the road,"" said Sumino
Kamei, senior currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 The euro bought around $1.4085 , having dropped as far
as $1.4075 on electronic trading platform EBS in late New York
trade on Wednesday. 
 The yen sat near 81 per dollar, a level it has hugged
tightly in recent days with markets still wary of further
central bank intervention to curb the Japanese currency if it
strengthens past 80.50.	
 Leading central banks launched the first coordinated market
intervention in more than a decade last week to reverse a run
that had seen the yen hit a record 76.25 on expectations Japan
-- a net creditor to the rest of the world -- would see a wave
of funds being repatriated to pay for earthquake reconstruction.	
 Japanese government bonds rose, with benchmark 10-year
futures up 0.19 point, while the 10-year yield eased
1.5 basis points to 1.2 percent. 
 Oil eased as the euro zone concerns rekindled worries about
economic growth -- and hence energy demand -- in the bloc,
although traders said continued political unrest in parts of the
Middle East would prevent it from falling far.	
 U.S. crude fell 0.3 percent to $105.48 a barrel and
Brent crude was off 0.2 percent at $115.35. 
 Spot gold traded around $1,437.90 an ounce, in sight
of its record $1,444.40 set earlier in the month.

(Recasts with Portugal's prime minister resigning, updates
with U.S. markets' close and Nikkei futures)
 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro sank on Wednesday
as Portugal's prime minister resigned after his government's
austerity measures were voted down in parliament, while gold
climbed near its record high on safe-haven bets.
 U.S. crude oil futures  ended at a 2-1/2 year high
above $105 a barrel as Palestinian rocket strikes on Israel
escalated Middle East geopolitical risks and gasoline
inventories posted the biggest seasonal decline on record.
 Global stocks ticked higher for a fifth straight day,
lifted by mining companies' shares as the prices of both
precious and base metals climbed. Gold rose above $1,440 an
ounce at one point and came within reach of its record high.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which
represents global equities, gained 0.1 percent. The index has
added nearly 4 percent in the past five sessions.
 On Wall Street, stocks gained as mining shares tracked
metals prices higher, though volume was among the lowest so
far this year.
 Silver hit its highest price since 1980 and gold advanced
as air strikes on Libya and renewed worries about the European
debt crisis increased investors' interest in precious metals,
deemed a good store of value in uncertain or volatile times.
 U.S.-dollar denominated Nikkei futures  were
little changed, pointing to a quiet start in Tokyo on Thursday
after a 1.7 percent drop on Wednesday.
 NO LONGER A SOCRATIC QUESTION
 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates submitted his
resignation to the president on Wednesday after parliament
earlier rejected his minority Socialist government's latest
austerity measures in a vote. For details see
[ID:nLIS002610].
 ""This raises the likelihood that Portugal will require a
bailout, but the question is about how much the market has
already factored this in,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist
at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""I'd say it's been factored in to a significant degree,
given the run-up we've seen in Portuguese yields and CDS.""
 The Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to 7.83
percent on Wednesday from Tuesday's 7.68 percent. Many
economists see borrowing costs above 7 percent as
unsustainable and say Portugal will have to resort to the
rescue mechanism.
 An International Monetary Fund spokeswoman said earlier
that Portugal has not requested an IMF-backed loan program,
dismissing speculation Lisbon was in talks with the fund.
 The euro hit a session low versus the U.S. dollar
following Socrates' resignation, although the slide is seen as
temporary, given the expectation for the European Central Bank
to raise interest rates next month.
 ""Expectations of the ECB raising rates favor the euro over
the U.S. dollar,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency
management at Investec Asset Management, which manages over
$10 billion in currency funds.
 ""We hold an overweight position in the euro and will be
looking to buy on any dips,"" he added.
 The euro  fell through the previous day's session
low, dropping to $1.4075 on trading platform EBS.
 ON WALL ST, IT'S A MATERIAL WORLD
 U.S. stocks rose in much lower-than-average volume. The
materials sector index <.GSPM> was the S&P 500's top
performer, rising 1.4 percent as metals prices climbed.
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold  shares jumped 5
percent to $54.88.
 Coal mining shares, which have risen recently amid
uncertainty over the future of nuclear power after the crisis
in Japan, also climbed.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 67.39 points,
or 0.56 percent, to 12,086.02. The Standard & Poor's 500
<.SPX> added 3.77 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,297.54. The
Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> gained 14.43 points, or 0.54 percent,
to 2,698.30.
 A plunge in sales of new U.S. single-family homes in
February to the lowest level since 1963 tempered gains in U.S.
stocks. The data from the U.S. Commerce Department suggested
the housing market's troubles were deepening. [ID:nCAT005396]
 Earlier, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed up nearly
0.5 percent at 1,112.36 as a rise in mining shares more than
offset weaker bank stocks.

BONDS FLAT, OIL AND GOLD JUMP
U.S. Treasuries were little changed as the possibility that
Japan might sell Treasuries to pay for repairing catastrophic
events offset a safe-haven bid due to turmoil in the Middle
East and North Africa. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury
note slipped 3/32 in price to yield 3.34 percent,
up from 3.33 percent late Tuesday.
 U.S. crude oil futures for May delivery  rose 78
cents to settle at $105.75 a barrel, the highest close since
September 2008, while Brent  dipped 15 cents to end at
$115.55.
 ""Yemen is a very hot topic now. It is not that important
to the oil market but unrest in the region gives enough
psychological support to prices,"" Andy Sommer, energy market
analyst with EGL, said.
 Spot gold  rose 0.7 percent to $1,437.45 an ounce
after hitting a session high of $1,440.90, near its recent
record of $1,444.40.
 Silver  gained 2.7 percent to $37.29 an ounce at
2025 GMT, just below the session high of $37.34 an ounce, from
$36.34 late in New York on Tuesday.
 Copper  rose over 2 percent on expectations of a

its highest since September 2008.

 * Mexico peso down 0.37 pct, Chile peso dips 0.06 pct
 * Fears of possible Portugal bailout hit risk appetite
 * Investors seeing losses as chance to jump into debt
 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, March 23 (Reuters) - Mexico and Chile's pesos
dipped on Wednesday on global jitters about Portugal, but
investors took advantage of the decline to put on fresh bets in
favor of Latin American currencies and the region's
high-yielding debt.
 Worries that a political crisis in Portugal could topple
the government -- as it did late in the day -- and force the
country to seek a bailout hit the euro, pushing investors to
sell riskier assets like stocks and emerging market
currencies.
 Worries about Japan's nuclear crisis and higher crude oil
prices due to unrest in the oil-producing Arab world also kept
investors on edge.
 ""Despite all these risks, we are still seeing flows of
foreigners into our debt market,"" said Salvador Orozco, a
currency and debt strategist at Santander in Mexico City.
 Solid growth and much higher interest rates than developed
economies have supported big bets on Latin America's currencies
by yield-hungry global investors.
 The yield on Mexico's 10-year bond  bid down 6
basis points to 7.65 percent after the spread between the bond
and its U.S. counterpart  blew out to around 440
basis points, its widest since late 2009.
 Investors have been piling into shorter-term debt like
Mexico's T-bills, known as Cetes, as they take advantage of the
spread between low-rate loans available in currencies like the
dollar and higher yields in emerging market investments.
 Europe's major economies were still doing well and the debt
crisis there was unlikely to derail global growth and
eventually hit Latin America's economies, analysts said.
 ""Latin America's fundamentals will not be contaminated (by
a Portugal bailout),"" said Roberto Melzi, a strategist at
Barclay's Capital in New York.
 Mexico's peso  weakened 0.37 percent to 12.0225 per
dollar after Portugal's parliament rejected proposed austerity
measures. The leader of the minority Socialist government
subsequently submitted his resignation.
 The currency could face further short-term losses if the
cost of pesos in dollars rises above 12.05 per dollar, near its
50 day-moving average, but steeper losses may be quickly
contained.
 ""So far, foreign investors are looking at losses as a
chance to get in at a good level,"" Orozco said.
 Traders said the peso could maintain a tendency to
strengthen that has been seen since November on an improving
outlook for the U.S. economy.
 Brazil's real  firmed 0.12 percent to 1.659 per
dollar. Brazil is offering among the highest interest rates in
the world, but has been trying to discourage excessive capital
flows that are strengthening the real and hurting local
manufacturers.
 The government could soon implement new measures to contain
the currency's gains as it trades close to a 1.65 per dollar
level, seen as the government's unofficial limit.
 The Chilean peso  pared sharp early losses to bid
a slight 0.06 percent weaker at 481.30 per dollar.
 Chile's currency has snapped back 1 percent from a nearly
seven-week low it hit last week. Concerns about higher crude
prices have hit Chile hard, since it imports most of its oil.
 But expectations that Chile will keep raising interest
rates at the same pace of last week's surprise 50-basis-point
hike are seen helping the currency recover.
 Fresh intervention from Chilean authorities is seen as
unlikely as policymakers step up their fight against
inflation.
 ""Chile's fundamentals are very strong, and the central bank
has also realized it cannot subordinate monetary policy to FX
policy,"" Barclay's Melzi said.
 The central bank introduced a program to buy $50 million a
day in January. Policymakers held interest rates steady in
January to back up the program, but inflation expectations
deteriorated and policymakers responded with a bigger hike.

 * February trade surplus bigger than expected
 * February industrial output rises vs. January
(Adds analyst comments, context)
 By Hilary Burke
 BUENOS AIRES, March 23 (Reuters) - Argentina's February
trade surplus beat market expectations and industrial output
rose sharply again, the government said on Wednesday, showing
Latin America's No. 3 economy is still growing strong.
 Argentina's economy expanded at a quick 9.2 percent last
year, driven by robust consumer spending, lucrative grains
exports and industrial production. [ID:nN18257577]
 Imports had been growing at double the rate of exports in
recent months due to avid domestic demand and the local
currency's appreciation against the dollar in real terms --
cutting into the government's cherished trade surplus.
 But February's trade surplus  bucked the trend,
widening 0.7 percent from a year earlier to $608 million.
 This was well above the median forecast of $310 million
given in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts and marked a significant
improvement over January, when the surplus shrank 58 percent
year-on-year, and December's 80 percent plunge .
 In February, exports grew 33 percent from the same month
last year, compared with 22 percent in January. Import growth
slowed to 39 percent from 52 percent in January.
 ""The increase in exports is due to three factors: the good
grains harvest, excellent commodities prices and strong demand
from Brazil"" for Argentina's industrial goods, said Ramiro
Castineira, an analyst at Econometrica consultancy.
 He noted that higher prices for Argentine goods explained a
good part of the increase in exports, while imports were
generally sustained by greater volumes.
 Argentina's center-left government is working to protect
local industry and the trade surplus. Officials expanded import
permits this month to cover 50 percent more goods, sparking
complaints from trading partners. [ID:nN09298892]
 The trade surplus is one of the centerpieces of the current
economic model, allowing the government to accumulate foreign
currency reserves, which it uses to pay off debt.
 INDUSTRY
 Industrial production  rose 1.4 percent in
February from January, according to the government's seasonally
adjusted data, driven by textiles and basic metals.
 In year-on-year terms, factory output rose 9.0 percent in
February, matching the number announced earlier this week by
President Cristina Fernandez. [ID:nN22164565]
 The non-seasonally adjusted figure fell slightly short of
market expectations, however, with a Reuters poll of six
analysts giving a 9.3 percent median forecast.
 The pace of growth also cooled in February after hitting
double digits from November through January . January
and February tend to be slower months for industry due to
vacation during the Southern Hemisphere's summer and planned
maintenance at plants.
 Castineira said industrial production was still very
strong, particularly in the automotive sector, but also in
other segments, which will help drive overall economic growth.
 His firm forecasts the economy will grow 6.5 percent this
year after expanding 8.5 percent in 2010. Private economists
say official data exaggerates growth somewhat, due to the gross
under-reporting of inflation. [ID:nN15268486]

(Adds three workers injured, merchant ships)	
 By Linda Sieg and Sumio Ito	
 TOKYO, March 24 (Reuters) - Japan will have to review its
nuclear power policy, its top government spokesman said on
Thursday as radiation from a damaged nuclear complex briefly
made Tokyo's tap water unsafe for babies and led to people
emptying supermarket shelves of bottled water.	
 Engineers are trying to stabilise the six-reactor nuclear
plant in Fukushima, 250 km (150 miles) north of the capital,
nearly two weeks after an earthquake and tsunami battered the
plant and devastated northeastern Japan, leaving nearly 26,000
people dead or missing.	
 ""It is certain that public confidence in nuclear power
plants has greatly changed,"" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Yuki Edano told Reuters. 
 ""In light of that, we must first end this situation and then
study from a zero base.""	
 Before last week, Japan's 55 nuclear reactors had provided
about 30 percent of the nation's electric power. The percentage
had been expected to rise to 50 percent by 2030, among the
highest in the world. 
 There were no fresh incidents of smoke or steam at the plant
on Thursday, but four of the plant's reactors are still
considered volatile, although on the way to stability.	
 ""It's still a bit early to make an exact time prognosis, but
my guess is in a couple of weeks the reactors will be cool
enough to say the crisis is over,"" said Peter Hosemann, a
nuclear expert at the University of California, Berkeley.	
 ""It will still be important to supply sufficient cooling to
the reactors and the spent fuel pools for a longer period of
time. But as long as this is ensured and we don't see any
additional large amount of radioactivity released, I am
confident the situation is under control.""	
 
 Tokyo's 13 million residents were told not to give tap water
to babies under 1 year old after contamination hit twice the
safety level this week. But it dropped back to allowable amounts
on Thursday.	
 Despite government appeals against panic, many supermarkets
and stores sold out of bottled water. 
 ""Customers ask us for water. But there's nothing we can do,""
said Masayoshi Kasahara, a store clerk at a supermarket in a
residential area of eastern Tokyo. ""We are asking for more
deliveries but we don't know when the next shipment will come.""	
 Radiation above safety levels has also been found in milk
and vegetables from Fukushima and the Kyodo news agency said
radioactive caesium 1.8 times higher than the standard level was
found in a leafy vegetable grown in a Tokyo research facility.	
 Singapore said it had found radioactive contaminants in four
samples of vegetables from Japan.	
 Earlier, it and Australia joined the United States and Hong
Kong in restricting food and milk imports from the zone, while
Canada became the latest of many nations to tighten screening
after the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.	
 A shipping industry official, meanwhile, said some merchant
vessels may be avoiding Tokyo port due to concern that crew
members may be exposed to radiation. 
 Radiation particles have been found as far away as Iceland,
and although Japan insists levels are not dangerous to adults,
it is the nation's most testing time since world War Two.

 DAMAGE	
 The estimated $300 billion damage from the 9.0 magnitude
earthquake and ensuing tsunami makes it the world's costliest
natural disaster, dwarfing Japan's 1995 Kobe quake and Hurricane
Katrina, which swept through New Orleans in 2005.	
 In Japan's north, more than a quarter of a million people
are in shelters. Some elderly displaced people have died from
cold and lack of medicines.	
 Exhausted and traumatised rescuers are still sifting through
the mud and wreckage where towns and villages once stood.	
 The official death toll from the disaster has risen to
9,523, but is bound to rise as 16,094 people are still missing.	
 Amid the suffering, though, there was a sense that Japan was
turning the corner in its humanitarian crisis. Aid flowed to
refugees, and phone, electricity, postal and bank services began
returning to the north, sometimes by makeshift means.	
 ""Things are getting much better,"" said 57-year-old Tsutomu
Hirayama, staying with his family at an evacuation centre in
Ofunato town.	
 ""For the first two or three days, we had only one rice ball
and water for each meal. I thought, how long is this going to go
on? Now we get lots of food, it's almost like luxury.""	
 Aftershocks are still jolting the country. Several shook
Tokyo on Thursday.	
 ADMIRATION FOR NUCLEAR WORKERS	
 At the Fukushima plant, technicians have successfully
attached power cables to all six reactors and started a pump at
one to cool overheating fuel rods.	
 Nearly 300 engineers, fast becoming national heroes for
braving danger inside an evacuation zone, are fighting to cool
fuel rods at the reactors.	
 They resumed work on Thursday at the No.3 reactor,
considered the most critical, after a one-day suspension when
black smoke was seen rising.	
 Operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) is trying
to re-start systems to keep the fuel cool and prevent further
radiation leaks or a complete meltdown, the nightmare scenario.	
 Three TEPCO employees who were working in water to connect a
cable were injured by radiation on Thursday and two were taken
to hospital with burns, the nuclear safety agency said.	
 Japan has urged the world not to overreact, and plenty of
experts appeared to back that up.	
 Jim Smith, of Britain's University of Portsmouth, said the
finding of 210 becquerels of radioactive iodine, twice the
safety limit, at a Tokyo water purification plant on Wednesday
should not be cause for panic. The safety level for adults is
300 becquerels.	
 ""The recommendation that infants are not given tap water is
a sensible precaution. But it should be emphasised that the
limit is set at a low level to ensure that consumption at that
level is safe over a fairly long period of time,"" he said.	
 ""This means that consumption of small amounts of tap water
-- a few litres, say -- at twice the recommended limit would not
present a significant health risk.""	
 The crisis in the world's third-biggest economy -- and its
key position in global supply chains, especially for the
automobile and technology sectors -- has added to jitters in
global financial markets, also worried by conflict in Libya and
Middle East protests.	
 Toyota Motor Corp , which has suspended
production at all of its 12 assembly plants in Japan, said it
would slow some North American production because of supply
problems although it would try to minimise disruptions.

 * Portugal's parliament says 'No' to austerity budget
 * Sterling falls after UK growth forecast
(Adds details, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday,
hurt by fears debt-ridden Portugal will require a bailout after
its parliament rejected the minority government's austerity
measures.
 The vote is likely to cause the government's
collapse.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates has said he will resign if the
plan fails to clear parliament and Portugal would probably be
forced to seek foreign aid.
 Socrates is to meet President Anibal Cavaco Silva later
Wednesday. For more, see: [ID:nLIS002609].
 The euro extended declines on the news and fell to a
session low, although it recovered as investors debated how
much of the news was already priced in.
 ""This raises the likelihood that Portugal will require a
bailout, but the question is about how much the market has
already factored this in,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist
at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""I'd say it's been
factored in to a significant degree, given the run-up we've
seen in Portuguese yields and CDS.""
 Earlier, an International Monetary Fund spokeswoman said
Portugal had not requested a loan program backed by the
institution, dismissing speculation Lisbon was in talks with
the fund.
 The euro  was last down 0.6 percent at $1.4105
after hitting a low for the session of $1.4099, according to
trading platform EBS.
 ""The euro is holding up pretty well,"" Dolan said. ""The
feeling is the periphery is covered by the bailout fund and the
core is in good shape.""
 Dolan suggested euro/dollar will still test $1.44-45 in the
short run.
 Most investors are betting any losses in the single
currency should be limited amid expectations of rising euro
zone interest rates.
 The euro was already down from a 4-1/2-month high against
the dollar, set in the previous session, ahead of the
Portuguese vote, after failing to break through options
barriers in the $1.4250 area. Analysts said the euro could dip
below $1.40 in the short term before rising toward $1.4280, the
November high.
 Adding to bearish euro sentiment was a document showing
European leaders will decide how to increase their bailout fund
only in June, not this week. [ID:nBRU011391]
 The yield on Irish government bonds soared to euro-lifetime
highs on uncertainty over whether a European summit later this
week will agree on an improvement of the terms on bailout
loans. [ID:nLDE72M0V0]
 Sterling was last down 0.8 percent to $1.6242 . It
touched the day's low as Britain lowered its growth projections
for the coming year and increased borrowing targets.
[ID:nLDE72M01C]
 DOWNSIDE LIMITED
 The prospect of higher interest rates, combined with a
sense that European policymakers have the will to resolve the
debt crisis, was expected to keep the euro supported around
$1.40, analysts said.
 ""Economically, the euro zone is showing clear signs of
recovery, politically the politicians are heading in the right
direction and expectations of the ECB raising rates favors the
euro over the U.S. dollar,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of
currency management at Investec Asset Management, which manages
over $10 billion in currency funds.
 ""We hold an overweight position in the euro and will be
looking to buy on any dips if the euro corrects,"" he added. 
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent against the yen at 80.85
, with markets still wary of intervention by authorities
to curb yen strength. A fall below the 80 to 80.50 area could
see officials return to the market to sell the Japanese
currency.

 * More attention to tail risks or ""black swans""
 * Cost to world economy, but a price worth paying
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - If 2011 is proving anything to
investors, it's that they may have to put up with a world of
repeated economic and political shocks -- but the caution this
produces may benefit the global economy in the long term.
 As the first quarter of the year comes to a close, the
dominant talking point among asset managers is just how
unpredictable world events have been this year, and how funds
may need to brace themselves for an era that continually throws
up such low-probability, market-moving developments.
 At the turn of the year, it would have been impossible to
forecast domino-like unrest across the Middle East and North
Africa, the resulting oil price spike, and this week's United
Nations-backed military intervention in Libya.
 Japan's 9.0-magnitude earthquake, devastating tsunami and
nuclear scare, while not inconceivable, could hardly have been
on anyone's list of first-quarter scenarios.


 LIVING WITH FAT TAILS
 But so-called ""tail risks"" -- named from the bell-shaped
graph showing a normal distribution of possible outcomes, with
the two ""tails"" representing low-probability extremes -- are
central to investor thinking since the global credit crisis of
2007-2009.
 The credit bubble and its dramatic implosion were blamed
partly on an underestimation of extreme risks to investment
portfolios. Low volatility measures and risk gauges before the
crash encouraged excessive risk-taking, which was followed by a
stampede for safety when the unpredictable chain of events
materialised.
 But if the probabilities of extreme events are higher than
previously thought -- or tails are fatter, in the jargon -- then
the market may just have to adapt, via more flexible and adept
management of portfolios, greater use of insurance and
derivatives, or even wider diversification of assets.
 If that prevents extreme investment behaviour, it could be
positive for a wide range of financial markets and economies.
 And although the credit crisis has been described as a
""black swan"" event -- an outcome impossible to conceive and
hence model -- investors may be less complacent if they now
realise that the future can be entirely unpredictable.
 
 UNSTABLE, VOLATILE WORLD
 Many fund managers attending Axa's Investment Managers'
annual economics symposium on ""Post-crisis Globalisation"" in
London last week felt a high number of tail risks would define
the years ahead.
 ""This is just something we're going to have to live with,""
said Mark Tinker, global equity portfolio manager at Axa.
 Giordano Lombardo, chief investment officer at Pioneer
Investments, told Reuters that his firm's recent launch of
Absolute Return funds -- which use more transparent and
risk-sensitive hedge fund strategies that include going both
long and short in markets -- was one response to the outlook.
Lombardo said the investment world would face a low-return
but more volatile environment in the years ahead as a result of
global economic imbalances, the vagaries of extreme monetary
policies, unstable public debts and high geopolitical risks.
 ""Clearly there is some link between heightened geopolitical
tension and structural flaws in the world economy, even if it's
difficult to give just one point of causation, "" he said.
 ""We believe we are moving into a more unstable world. That
will involve more trendless, volatile markets -- but markets
which are not without opportunities.""
 This new environment may hurt the global economy by imposing
higher insurance costs and greater price volatility while making
investors less optimistic.
 But the global economy could actually benefit if cautious
investors now avoid the type of irrational and dangerous
exhuberance seen in the credit bubbles of 2005 and 2006. The new
mood of caution could act as a financial regulator of sorts.
 Wall Street's VIX index of implied volatility in S&P 500
stocks currently paints a picture of average volatility almost
twice the pre-credit crisis lows -- but with lower peaks of
volatility in shocks since the crisis.
 The Lehman Brothers collapse saw volatility as high as 80
percent. The Greek crisis saw it peak close to 50 percent, while
the index crested just above 30 percent after the Japan quake.
 ""Although ""black swan"" events are rare, they are vital for
successful investments. They cannot be avoided, but investors
can sidestep them with a good diversification strategy,"" Peter
Bezak, portfolio strategist at Zurich-based asset manager
Sarasin told clients this week.
 ""Investors should be aware of the portfolio risk and include
the possibility of extreme situations in their deliberations.
This is the only way for investors to survive these situations
and maintain their long-term strategy until the market recovers,
which usually occurs not long after.""

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Worries that a political
crisis in Portugal could topple the government and force the
country to seek a bailout sent the euro lower on Wednesday and
drove gold within a whisker of its all-time high on safe-haven
demand.
 Continued unrest in the Middle East and North Africa drove
up the price of U.S. oil, while Wall Street stocks gained as
mining stocks tracked metals prices higher.
 Silver hit its highest price since 1980 as the ongoing
Western air strikes on Libya and the worries about Portugal
revived worries about the European debt crisis. Precious metals
are considered a good store of value in uncertain or volatile
times.
 Portugal's parliament started a plenary session to debate
the government's austerity measures, setting the stage for the
likely collapse of the minority Socialist administration. Prime
Minister Jose Socrates has threatened to resign if the package
is rejected in a vote expected later on Wednesday.
 A statement from Socrates was expected at 2000 GMT.
 The cost of insuring Portugal's five-year debt against
default hit two-month highs, reflecting the growing belief that
Lisbon will follow Greece and Ireland in seeking emergency
funding if parliament rejects the austerity measures.
 An International Monetary Fund spokeswoman said Portugal
has not requested a loan program backed by the IMF, dismissing
speculation Lisbon was in talks with the fund.
 ""There's currently a lot of concern on the Portuguese
budget vote and the potential political implication for it,""
said Mary Nicola, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New
York.
 ""The fear is that if Portugal failed to agree on austerity
measures, we can potentially see the country forced into the
EFSF"" rescue fund, she said.
 Hopes that this week's European summit would yield a
decision on how to increase the effective capacity of the euro
zone bailout fund were dashed after the release of a draft
document prepared for the meeting. The decision will likely
come in June. For details, see [ID:nBRU011391]
 Portugal's political crisis has knocked the euro from its
recent 4-1/2-month highs against the U.S. dollar, although the
slide is seen as temporary, given the expectation for the
European Central Bank to raise interest rates next month.
 ""Expectations of the ECB raising rates favors the euro over
the U.S. dollar,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency
management at Investec Asset Management, which manages over $10
billion in currency funds.
 ""We hold an overweight position in the euro and will be
looking to buy on any dips,"" he added.
 The euro  was last down 0.4 percent at $1.4135,
having hit a low for the session of $1.4105, according to
trading platform EBS.

 * IAEA says nuclear crisis still a serious concern
 * U.S. to block milk, fruit, vegetable imports from near
plant
 * Radiation in Tokyo water is dangerous for infants
 * Engineers battle to stabilise Fukushima reactors

 By Shinichi Saoshiro and Yoko Kubota	
 TOKYO, March 24 (Reuters) - Tokyo residents were warned not
to give babies tap water because of radiation leaking from a
nuclear plant crippled in the earthquake and tsunami that
devastated northeast Japan in the world's costliest natural
disaster.	
 The U.N. atomic agency said there had been some positive
developments at the Fukushima nuclear plant 250 km (150 miles)
north of Tokyo but the overall situation remained serious. Some
countries have started blocking imports of produce from Japan,
fearful of radiation contamination.	
 The first official estimate put the cost from the March 11
disaster at more than $300 billion, dwarfing losses from both
the 1995 Kobe quake and Hurricane Katrina that swept through New
Orleans in 2005, making it the world's costliest natural
disaster. 
 The plant, battered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and
tsunami that has left 23,000 people dead or missing, has still
not been brought under control, and workers were forced away
from the complex when black smoke began rising from one of its
six reactors.	
 ""There are some positive developments related to the
availability of electrical power...although the overall
situation remains of serious concern,"" Graham Andrew, a senior
official of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told
a news conference. 
 Tokyo authorities said on Wednesday that water at a
purification plant for the capital of 13 million people had 210
becquerels of radioactive iodine -- more than twice the safety
level for infants. 
 Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara said that level posed no
immediate risk. ""But, for infants under age one, I would like
them to refrain from using tap water to dilute baby formula.""	
 As concern grew over the risk to food safety of radiation
from the nuclear plant, the United States became the first
nation to block some food imports from the disaster zone.	
 It is stopping imports of milk, vegetable and fruit from
four prefectures in the vicinity of the plant.	
 Hong Kong, a major importers of Japanese food, also banned
produce and milk imports from the disaster zone. Japan's Jiji
news agency said Hong Kong authorities had found radioactivity
levels in spinach and turnip samples up to 10 times above the
safety limit.	
 France this week asked the European Commission to look into
harmonising controls on radioactivity in imports from Japan,
after the world's worst atomic crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.	
 
 Authorities have said above-safety radiation levels had
been discovered in 11 types of vegetables from the area, in
addition to milk and water, and have halted shipments of some
food and told people there to stop eating leafy vegetables.	
 Chief cabinet secretary Yukio Edano, the government's public
face during the disaster, urged the world not to overreact.	
 Edano also said an exclusion zone around
the plant did not need to be expanded and he urged Tokyo
residents not to hoard bottled water, a plea that fell on deaf
ears with many shops quickly selling out of supplies.	
 ""If this were temporary, I wouldn't be so worried. If this
is a long term, I think we have a lot to worry about,"" said Riku
Kato, father of a one-year-old baby.	
 Physicians for Social Responsibility, a U.S.
anti-nuclear group, disputed the food safety assurances and
called for a more strict ban on sales of exposed food.	
 ""There is no safe level of radionuclide exposure, whether
from food, water or other sources. Period,"" said physician Jeff
Patterson, a former president of the group. 
 The Asian nation's worst crisis since World War Two has sent
shock waves through global financial markets.	
 The damage estimate of $300 billion could go
higher as it does not include losses in economic activity from
planned power outages or the broader impact of the nuclear
crisis. The 1995 Kobe quake cost $100 billion while Hurricane
Katrina caused $81 billion in damage. 
 More than a quarter of a million people are living in
shelters, while rescuers and sniffer dogs comb debris and mud
looking for corpses and personal momentos.	
 
 POWER CABLES ATTACHED	
 Technicians have successfully attached power cables to all
six reactors at the Fukushima plant and started a pump at one to
cool overheating fuel rods.	
 As well as having its workers on the front line in highly
dangerous circumstances, Tokyo Electric Power Co
(TEPCO) is also facing accusations of a slow disaster response
and questions over why it originally stored more uranium at the
plant than it was designed to hold.	
 The IAEA has expressed concern about a lack of information
from Japanese authorities, citing missing data on temperatures
of spent fuel pools at the facility's reactors 1, 3 and 4. 
 Japan Nuclear Safety Commission Chairman Haruki Madarame
said the government was ""swiftly releasing information that is
certain and not speculative"" within Japan, but acknowledged it
is behind in releasing information to foreign
countries. "" 
 Experts have said tiny radioactive particles, measured by a
network of monitoring stations as they spread eastwards from
Japan across the Pacific, North America, the Atlantic and to
Europe, were far too low to cause any harm to humans. 
 ""It's only a matter of days before it disperses in the
entire northern hemisphere,"" said Andrea Stahl, a senior
scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research. 
 
 GLOBAL IMPACT	
 The Japan disaster has dealt a blow to the nuclear power
industry around the world. Italy became the latest nation to
re-assess its programme, announcing a one-year moratorium on
site selection and building of plants.	
 Crisis in the world's third-biggest economy -- and its key
position in global supply chains, especially for the auto and
technology sectors -- has added to global market jitters, also
affected by conflict in Libya and unrest in the Middle East.	
 The death toll from the disaster has risen to 9,523, but
with 16,094 people still missing, it is certain to rise.	
 There are reports that dozens of survivors, mostly elderly,
have died in hospitals and evacuation centres from a lack of
proper treatment, or simply because of the cold.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2011 02:37PM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Hungary banks see deal with govt on bad loans," * Talks may finish in time to end eviction moratorium by July
* State asset management firm discussed - bank association
* New instrument would make monthly fx repayments predictable
 
 By Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, March 23 (Reuters) - Hungarian banks may reach an
agreement with the government within a month on measures to help
borrowers who defaulted on mortgage loans or are close to
default, the Hungarian Banking Association said on Wednesday.
 Parliament recently extended a moratorium on the eviction of
defaulted mortgage loan holders to July 1 from April 15.
 Bad loans, coupled with the eviction moratorium weigh on the
books of Hungarian banks who also have to pay a big crisis tax
imposed by the government last year.
 ""I hope very much that we can agree with the government
within a month and then the July 1 date to introduce the
measures look realistic,"" Daniel Gyuris, member of the banking
group's presidency told Reuters.
 ""We have to find a solution to this complex set of problems
soon as only that could cause a real improvement in banks'
portfolio quality,"" he said. ""Every month of further delay would
push 4,000 to 5,000 further families off the edge.""
 The weakening of the forint and a surge of the Swiss franc
since mid-2008 have boosted the loan instalments of hundreds of
thousands of households who took out foreign currency loans,
mainly in Swiss franc .
 Both the government and banks are interested in finding a
solution to the problem of non-performing loans as mass
evictions would hit the real estate market, while provisioning
for bad loans curbs banks ability to lend to the economy.
Gyuris said the state could take over the homes of about
10,000 borrowers who are in the worst situation, and who owe
about 20 billion forints ($104.9 million) to banks. These
families would then rent their homes from the state.
 ""The state would take a role in that via a state asset
manager (company),"" he said. ""That's the circle in which clients
will realize the biggest loss and also banks will have to take
the biggest sacrifice here.""
 The loan repayment difficulties of a further 70,000-100,000
families can be solved if they move to cheaper homes, he said.
 The third issue discussed is an instrument to smooth out the
monthly repayment burden which heavily fluctuates due to
exchange rate swings, Gyuris said.
 ""It's not about fixing the exchange rate or (banks)
realizing the exchange rate losses (on the loans),"" he said.
 He said the government could guarantee the repayment of
additional debts caused by the exchange rate fluctuation for a
certain guarantee fee. Banks would not need to create provisions
to cover these debts.
 Gyuris said certain proposals discussed during the talks

 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Worries that a political
crisis in Portugal could topple the government and force the
country to seek a bailout sent the euro lower on Wednesday and
drove gold within a whisker of its all-time high on safe-haven
demand.
 Continued unrest in the Middle East and North Africa drove
up the price of oil, while Wall Street stocks rallied as mining
stocks rose with higher metals prices.
 Silver hit its highest price since 1980 as the ongoing
Western air strikes on Libya and the worries about Portugal
revived worries about the European debt crisis.
 Portugal's parliament started a plenary session to debate
the government's austerity measures, setting the stage for the
likely collapse of the minority Socialist administration. Prime
Minister Jose Socrates has threatened to resign if the package
is rejected in a vote expected later on Wednesday.
 A statement from Socrates was expected at 2000 GMT.
 The cost of insuring Portugal's five-year debt against
default hit two-month highs, reflecting the growing belief that
Lisbon will follow Greece and Ireland in seeking emergency
funding if parliament rejects the austerity measures.
 The yield on two-year Irish bonds rose to a euro-era high
of 10.715 percent, 55 basis points above the 10-year yield,
resulting in an Irish yield curve at its most inverted levels
since the launch of the euro zone.
 ""There's currently a lot of concern on the Portuguese
budget vote and the potential political implication for it. The
fear is that if Portugal failed to agree on austerity measures,
we can potentially see the country forced into the EFSF"" rescue
fund, said Mary Nicola, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in
New York.
 Hopes that this week's European summit would yield a
decision on how to increase the effective capacity of the euro
zone bailout fund were dashed after the release of a draft
document prepared for the meeting. The decision will likely
come in June. For details, see [ID:nBRU011391]
 Portugal's political crisis has knocked the euro from its
recent 4-1/2-month highs against the U.S. dollar, although the
slide is expected to be temporary, given the expectation for
the European Central Bank to raise interest rates next month.
 ""Expectations of the ECB raising rates favors the euro over
the U.S. dollar,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency
management at Investec Asset Management, which manages over $10
billion in currency funds.
 The euro  was last down 0.5 percent at $1.4122,
having hit a low for the session of $1.4105, according to
trading platform EBS.
 U.S. STOCKS RISE
 On Wall Street, the Dow rose moderately while the benchmark
S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained slightly. The S&P index of materials
stocks <.GSPM> was up 1.1 percent, the top-performing sector on
the S&P 500, as metals prices rose, including a more than 2
percent gain in copper. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold 
shares jumped 4.4 percent at $54.59.
 Coal mining shares, which have risen recently amid
uncertainty over the future of nuclear power after the crisis
in Japan, also climbed. Consol Energy  gained 2.49
percent, Peabody Energy  was up 1.9 percent and Massey
Energy  was up 2.3 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 45.33

1,294.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 3.71 points,
or 0.14 percent, to 2,687.58.
 A plunge in sales of new U.S. single-family homes in
February to the lowest level since 1963 tempered gains. The
data from the U.S. Commerce Department suggested the housing
market slide was deepening. [ID:nCAT005396]
 An objection by the Federal Reserve to Bank of America's
 plans to boost its dividend weighed on bank stocks.
Bank of America shares fell 2.5 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed up nearly 0.5 percent

 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday
on concerns a political crisis in debt-ridden Portugal could
force the government to seek aid, though losses in the single

zone interest rates.
 The euro eased from the 4-1/2-month high against the dollar
set on Tuesday after failing to break through options barriers
in the $1.4250 area. Analysts said the euro could dip below
$1.40 in the short term, before rising toward $1.4280, the

 Portugal's parliament was expected to reject austerity

 * Ample foreign currency reserves at central bank
 
 By Khaled Yacoub Oweis
 DAMASCUS, March 23 (Reuters) - The Syrian pound has fallen 4
percent and Damascus stock prices have tumbled since protests
against Baathist rule erupted last week, threatening efforts to
attract foreign investment to improve Syria's infrastructure.
 The government had hoped to use the bourse to raise capital
as it opens sectors such as electricity generation and transport
to foreign investors, ending decades of state control.
 But a violent crackdown on nearly a week of protests in
Deraa and other southern towns, in which security forces have
killed 10 people, has been a severe setback for the drive to
attract badly needed foreign investment.
 On Wednesday alone, security forces killed six people in an
attack on a mosque in Deraa, site of unprecedented protests
against President Bashar al-Assad's Baathist rule and demands
for an end to corruption.
 A Syrian businessman who has met Western companies to
discuss forming joint ventures to bid for government projects
said the projects could well be viable, but the rising political
risk had prevented the talks from moving forward.
 ""There is reluctance to put big money into Syria now,"" he
said, referring to a billion dollar metro line project and the
planned expansion of a highway to Iraq.
 Foreign direct investment fell to $1.4 billion in 2009 from
$2.4 billion in 2008, according to the World Bank --- a fraction
of the $85 billion the government says it needs to overhaul the
transport system, power, health and communication network.
 ""Officials are talking about technicalities of projects as
if political discontent does not exist,"" another businessman
said. ""They have not figured out that an open political system
and rule of law are powerful investment magnets.""
 On the 20-company Damascus Stock Exchange, which opened two
years ago, every stock that has traded since the protests
erupted in Deraa on Friday fell by the 3 percent limit. The main
market index has fallen 14 percent from its Jan. 26 2011 peak.
 Even before the latest protests, foreigners were deterred
from buying Syrian shares by extensive security checks, and by
the U.S. sanctions imposed on Syria in 2004 for its support for
militant groups, a bourse official said.
 ""The risk of holding the Syrian pound has gone up. There is
demand for foreign currency and people are reluctant to part
with their dollars,"" said a currency dealer in Damascus.
 The Syrian pound, which is not fully convertible -- a legacy
of Soviet-style economic policies -- was trading at 48.75 to the
dollar at exchange dealers on Wednesday, though the official
rate remained stable at 47 to the dollar.
 Syria's economy underwent heavy nationalisation after the
Baath Party took power in 1963. Assad, who succeeded his late
father Hafez al-Assad in 2000, kept the authoritarian system
intact, including the imposition of emergency laws, but lifted
some bans on trading and private enterprise.
 Privately held banks were allowed to operate in Syria eight
years ago, and there are now 14 -- all subsidiaries of Arab
banks -- but the sector is still far smaller than that of
laissez faire Lebanon next door.
 The central bank last intervened heavily in the market in
2005, when the assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik
al-Hariri in Beirut raised international pressure on Syria and
pushed the pound down to 59 to the dollar from 46, before the
central bank pumped foreign currency into the market.
 There was no immediate comment from the monetary authorities
on the falling exchange rate, but the central bank has
repeatedly said that Syria's foreign currency position is
strong, with billions of dollars in liquid reserves.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Worries that a political
crisis in Portugal could force the debt-laden country to seek a
bailout sent the euro lower on Wednesday and triggered
safe-haven demand for German government bonds.
 The renewed fears of a euro zone debt crisis drove down
European banking shares and weighed on stocks in New York. U.S.
Treasury debt prices, which had risen earlier on safe-haven
demand, slipped following a Federal Reserve purchase.
 Uncertainty over the longer-term impact of Japan's
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis fueled a safety bid for
precious metals, driving up the price of gold and sending
silver to the highest price since 1980.
 The cost of insuring Portugal's five-year debt against
default hit two-month highs, reflecting the growing belief that
Lisbon will follow Greece and Ireland in seeking emergency

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2011 12:05PM ET</span>",Q&A-Chinese subsidies: Saved from attack by the WTO?," * Chinese subsidies shift into trade law limelight
 * WTO ruling unlikely to dent anti-subsidy action by EU, US
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck and Michael Martina
 BRUSSELS/BEIJING, March 23 (Reuters) - A ruling by the
world's top trade court against a series of U.S. trade barriers
has put the spotlight on Chinese subsidies and the ability of
trading nations to erect obstacles to cheap goods from China.
 The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling this month
dismayed U.S. policymakers and industry and has raised questions
about European Union plans to challenge illegal Chinese state
financing as well as export dumping.
 Here are some questions and answers about the likely impact
of the WTO ruling on the EU's dual measures against China.
 
 WHY ARE CHINESE SUBSIDIES SO TOPICAL?
 EU and U.S. producers from tile makers to car tyre producers
have warned of shrinking market shares as financial crises make
consumers opt for cheap Chinese goods, increasingly in high-tech
sectors thus far dominated by Western firms.
 Concerns China might be using state funds to push up the
technology ladder rose with China's 12th five-year plan this
month -- which made backing for high-tech industry a priority --
and high-profile attempts by Chinese firms to buy stakes in
high-tech EU and U.S. firms.
 Europe's trade chief said last year China subsidised ""nearly
everything"" and has called on EU industry to help identify
illegal Chinese state aid. Last year, the EU executive vowed to
fight subsidies wherever possible.
 
 WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WTO THIS MONTH?
 The World Trade Organization's top court upheld Chinese
objections to dual anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed
by the United States on Chinese steel pipes, tires and woven
sacks that Washington said were unfairly priced and subsidised.
 In particular, the appellate body supported China's argument
that the imposition of such a double penalty broke WTO law. The
EU and United States regularly impose dual duties on foreign
exporters, but China and Vietnam, which are not considered
market economies, are vulnerable to higher combined tariffs.
 Separately, the WTO ruling said contrary to the U.S. view,
Chinese state-owned enterprises do not necessarily perform
government functions that would render them capable of offering
state subsidies, tax benefits or cheap loans.
 ""China's (economic) model has been affirmed to a degree
within the international community,"" said Tu Xinquan, a
professor and trade expert at the University of International
Business and Economics in Beijing.
 
 WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION TO THE RULING?
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said he was ""deeply
troubled"" by the report and criticised it for over reaching,
while U.S. lawmakers warned it would slow trade liberalisation.
 A Chinese government statement hailed the report as
establishing ""the United States acts unlawfully in the methods
by which it calculates and imposes countervailing duties.""
 Trade lawyers and diplomats say the ruling may further
embolden China to challenge trade barriers at the WTO.
 
 WILL THIS END EU AND U.S. PLANS FOR ANTI-SUBSIDY DUTIES?
 That's unlikely. Trade lawyers in the EU and United States
say they have enough legal instruments to keep challenging
Chinese export pricing and subsidies simultaneously if and when
their domestic industries ask them to. 
 The EU, for instance, protects itself against Chinese legal
challenges with rules that force it to set import duties against
the lowest impact level of illegal Chinese trade practices.
 It also focuses on domestic rather than export subsidies as
a way to avoid allegations of imposing double penalties, and has
targeted some sector-specific subsidies and specific lending
practices, which trade officials say is in line with WTO law.
 In the jargon-filled world of trade defence law, countries
can make easy tweaks to legislation to turn a trade barrier
deemed illegal by the WTO into a legal defence measure.
 A defiant EU Commission last week proposed dual anti-subsidy
and anti-dumping duties against Chinese glossy paper, insisting
its duties were safe from challenge. INSERT
 
 WILL FIRMS KEEP ASKING FOR DUAL ACTION AGAINST CHINA?
 Western firms are likely to demand increasing action against
Chinese subsidies as the number of anti-dumping measures falls.
 That is largely because in 2016 at the latest, China will
automatically enter the world club of market economies. 
 From then on, China will be able to defend itself more
successfully against allegations of market dumping, handing
greater power to subsidy complaints.

 Incumbent: Valdis Dombrovskis
 Date of Birth: August 5, 1971
 Term: Took office for second time on Nov. 3, 2010 after his
Unity bloc of three political parties came first in a general
election in October and formed a coalition government with the
Union of Greens and Farmers. The next election is due in 2014.

conditions to adopt the euro. It hopes to enter the euro zone in
2014.
 -- Dombrovskis first became prime minister in March 2009

decisions to slash spending and hike taxes.
 -- Despite the unruliness of his first coalition, he managed
to force through the cuts necessary to get public finances back

 -- Critics say the government is only focused on cutting and
not providing a base for growth. Dombrovskis says that making

 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Worries that a political
crisis in Portugal could force the debt-laden country to seek a
bailout sent the euro lower on Wednesday and triggered
safe-haven demand for U.S. and German government bonds.
 The renewed fears of a euro zone debt crisis drove down
European banking shares and weighed on stocks in New York.
 Uncertainty over the longer-term impact of Japan's
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis also drove a bid for
safety, boosting the price of gold and driving silver to the
highest price since 1980.
 The cost of insuring Portugal's five-year debt against
default hit two-month highs, reflecting the growing belief that
Lisbon will follow Greece and Ireland in seeking emergency
funding if parliament rejects a new series of austerity
measures.
 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates has threatened to
resign if the package is rejected in a vote expected Wednesday,
meaning his minority Socialist government could collapse a day
before a key European summit.

budget vote and the potential political implication for it. The
fear is that if Portugal failed to agree on austerity measures,

decision on how to increase the effective capacity of the euro
zone bailout fund were dashed after the release of a draft
document prepared for the meeting. The decision will likely
come in June. [ID:nBRU011391].
 Portugal's political crisis has knocked the euro from its
recent 4-1/2-month highs against the U.S. dollar, although the
slide is expected to be temporary, given the expectation for
the European Central Bank to raise interest rates next month.
 The euro  was last down 0.4 percent at $1.4144,
having hit a low for the session of $1.4105, according to
trading platform EBS.
 The renewed concerns over European debt halted a week-long
tentative rebound in European stocks and took a toll on Wall
Street.

 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday
on concerns a political crisis in debt-ridden Portugal could
force the government to seek financial aid, though currency
losses should be limited, given expectations of rising euro
zone interest rates.
 The euro had eased from a 4-1/2-month against the dollar on
Tuesday after failing to break through options barriers in the
$1.4250 area. Analysts said the euro could dip below $1.40 in
the short term, before rising toward $1.4280, the November
high.
 Portugal's parliament was expected to reject austerity
measures, setting the stage for the possible collapse of the
minority Socialist government a day before a European summit.
Portuguese bond yields rose as investors priced in increased
risk of a debt restructuring. For details, see

trading platform EBS.
 Adding to bearish sentiment was a document showing European
leaders will only decide on how to increase their bailout fund
in June, not this week. [ID:nBRU011391]

 DOWNSIDE LIMITED
 The prospect of higher interest rates, combined with a
sense that European policymakers have the will to resolve the
debt crisis was expected to keep the euro supported around
$1.40, analysts said.
 ""Economically, the euro zone is showing clear signs of
recovery, politically the politicians are heading in the right
direction, and expectations of the ECB raising rates favors the
euro over the U.S. dollar,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of
currency management at Investec Asset Management, which manages
just over $10 billion in currency funds.
 ""We hold an overweight position in the euro and will be
looking to buy on any dips if the euro corrects"".
 A European Central Bank official warned that keeping rates
very low amounted to an expansionary policy that risked
spurring excessive risk-taking. [ID:nPISNEE7B8]
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 80.99
, with markets wary of intervention by authorities to

 NAIROBI, March 23 (Reuters) - Kenyan tyremaker Sameer Africa
said its profit fell 72 percent in 2010 due to higher
production costs and it expected increasing international oil
prices to erode its margins this year.
 The company's pretax profit dropped to 62.2 million
shillings from 221.5 million a year before, hit by increased raw
material costs -- especially rubber, high energy costs and a
depreciating shilling.
 ""The operating environment continued to be very challenging

falling against the dollar in February and slumped to a record
low earlier in the month.
 The company's sales revenue barely changed, up by 2 percent
to 3.34 billion shillings, while its cost of sales was up 11
percent to 2.68 billion.
 It said the slowdown in revenue was due to lower sales to
neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda.
 Its earnings per share was down 63 percent to 0.21
shillings, while net assets slid 4.5 percent to 2.29 billion.
 Sameer Africa had issued a profit warning for the year
ending December in November, attributing it to rising raw
material prices and unfavourable exchange rates.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2011 09:33AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-Portugal's politics as government faces collapse," By Shrikesh Laxmidas
 LISBON, March 23 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament is
expected to reject the government's latest austerity measures on
Wednesday, setting the stage for the possible collapse of the
minority Socialist administration.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates has said he will resign if the
plan is defeated. He has said its rejection would force the
debt-laden country to follow Greece and Ireland and seek an
international bailout, which he opposes.
 Following are possible scenarios for Portuguese politics in
the next few months:
 
 PARLIAMENT REJECTS AUSTERITY MEASURES
 Opposition parties have complained about not being consulted
about the measures before their presentation to Brussels on
March 11 and have said the additional spending cuts and a levy
on pensions would mean severe sacrifices for the Portuguese.
 All opposition parties have proposed resolutions calling for
the rejection of the measures which means, barring any surprise
last-minute talks to avert the crisis, the government's plan
will be blocked.
 The Socialists have 97 of parliament's 230 seats and now
have no allies on whom they can rely. The plan needs at least
116 votes to pass.
 
 LAST-MINUTE TALKS AVERT CRISIS
 The Socialist government says it wants to negotiate the
measures with the opposition to prevent a damaging crisis, but
the other parties have so far rejected the offer.
 Analysts say there has been limited room for dialogue with
the main opposition Social Democrats (PSD), who lead in opinion
polls and are seen as using the chance to come to power.
 President Anibal Cavaco Silva said his ability to negotiate
a compromise was limited by the government's sudden presentation
of the measures and rapid harsh reaction by the other parties.
 
 PM SOCRATES RESIGNS AFTER MEASURES REJECTED
 Socrates, in a second term that was set to end in 2013, has
threatened to resign if the opposition rejects the measures. 
 Many analysts speculate he will present his resignation to
Cavaco Silva on Wednesday at their weekly 1900 GMT meeting.
 Some analysts say he will only quit after attending the
crucial European Union leaders' summit starting on Thursday,
while others say the president would only be likely to accept
Socrates' resignation after the summit. 
 In either case, the president is likely to call the state
advisory council and the heads of the political parties next
week to discuss the next steps to solve the crisis.
 Cavaco Silva could ask the parties to agree on a new prime
minister and a coalition government without calling an election,
but consensus is unlikely to be reached as Socrates and PSD
leader Pedro Passos Coelho have indicated a general election
would be the most legitimate solution to the stand off.
 
 SNAP ELECTION AND CARETAKER GOVERNMENT
 Seen as the most likely outcome, the president calls a snap
election and dissolves parliament. An election can be held 55
days after it is called at the earliest, meaning the country
would not go to the ballots before late in May.
 According to Portugal's constitution, the government would
have to stay on as a caretaker administration, its functions
reduced to acts strictly necessary to manage public matters. 
 Parliament would remain in place until after an election.
 Political analysts say a caretaker government would be
unable to take major initiatives on its own without consulting
the parliament. 
 Many economists see Portugal's record-level bond yields as
unsustainable and say the debt-laden country will have to resort
to the rescue mechanism.
 Market sources say they are concerned about a period of
inaction until a new government takes over, but add the
political volatility caused by the row over austerity has
already been priced in to a certain degree.
 The PSD has been ahead in opinion polls for several months
now, with around 35-38 percent of voting intentions, but rarely
nearing the threshold needed to win an absolute majority. 
 The centre-right party is broadly committed to cutting the
budget deficit and has not ruled out requesting an international
bailout.
 Analysts say the Socialist election machine should not be
underestimated. Socrates, an experienced and fierce campaigner,
has said he would stand in a new election. His party still has
around 25-30 percent of voting intentions in recent polls and
could still thwart PSD's plans.

 By Andrei Makhovsky and Olzhas Auyezov
 MINSK/KIEV, March 23 (Reuters) - Belarus, battling a balance
of payments crisis that has led investors to dump its sovereign
debt, said on Wednesday it would lift some foreign exchange
controls as it seeks a bailout loan from Russia.
 The confidence-building measure gave little reassurance to
fixed-income investors, however, as they sold off Belarus' $800
million, 7-year Eurobond issued in January, pushing its yield up
by 140 basis points to over 12 percent.
 ""The problem is the market is in panic,"" said Sergei Strigo,
head of emerging debt at Amundi Asset Management in London.
 Belarus has come under pressure following a spike in state
spending in the run-up to December's presidential election, in
which Alexander Lukashenko won a fourth term amid controversy
over a crackdown against his opponents.
 The huge current account deficit and depletion of foreign
reserves that have resulted from the spree do not yet challenge
Lukashenko's grip on power. But they have weakened his position
in emergency loan talks with former Soviet master Russia.
 A delegation led by Finance Minister Andrei Kharkovets held
talks in Moscow on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Alexei
Kudrin ""on questions of credit and financial cooperation"", the
Russian finance ministry said.
 Belarus is seeking a $1.7 billion loan from a Russia-led
bailout fund set up by a group of ex-Soviet states, as well as a
multi-billion-dollar export credit to finance the construction
of a Russian-built nuclear power plant, officials said.
 Prospects for fresh aid from the International Monetary Fund
have, meanwhile, been hurt after the United States and European
Union -- both strongly represented at the Fund -- slapped travel
bans on Lukashenko and top officials over the election.
 
 DEFAULT STILL SEEN UNLIKELY
 Strigo, whose fund holds Belarus bonds, said a default
looked unlikely due to the small volume of debt. ""They do have
sources of finance, the IMF or Russia, or they can privatise.
However all this will take a bit of time,"" he said.
 Belarus is one of Europe's poorest countries and has not
undergone the sort of free market transformation experienced by
Poland and other new EU members, leaving it dependent on cheap
Russian energy and other support from Moscow.
 ""Even if the scenario of Belarus obtaining a loan from
Russia were to transpire, it will only provide a temporary
respite,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Ivan Tchakarov
said in a note.
 ""The market will need stronger reassurance that the key
underlying vulnerability in the economy, the current account
deficit, is being addressed in earnest,"" Tchakarov commented.
 
 RESUMPTION
 The central bank introduced a series of restrictions on
foreign exchange trading this year as its reserves fell 20
percent in January-February to $4 billion, enough to cover just
a few weeks of imports.
 The regulator said on Wednesday it would restart sales of
foreign currency to local banks from April 1, but would sell
only as much as it can buy from exporters. Central bank sales of
forex in cash remain suspended.
 It added that priority would be given to foreign currency
purchases ""for payment for medicines, for supplying the country
with natural gas, for paying back debts in foreign currency and
for other uses"".
 ""Panic demand from the population is gone, people have
calmed down,"" central bank chairman Pyotr Prokopovich told state
news agency BelTA. ""But now entrepreneurs have started buying
foreign currency ... We will not supply entrepreneurs.""
 Analysts say the Belarussian rouble, which trades at around
3,020 per dollar, is overvalued, given a current account deficit
for this year forecast at 14 percent of GDP.
 RBS analyst Tim Ash estimated that to reach fair value, the
Belarussian unit would need to weaken by 20-30 percent.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Wednesday on disappointment at a delay in increasing a
euro zone bailout fund and on wariness before a Portuguese vote
on austerity measures.
 Having failed to take out options barriers at $1.4250, the
euro was down around a cent from a four and a half month high of
$1.4249 on Tuesday and heading towards reported stop loss orders
below $1.4140. 
 A document showed euro zone states will take a decision on
how to increase the effective capacity of their bailout fund

conclusions prepared for the summit showed.
 ""This is another euro-negative piece of news -- countries

said a London-based head of FX sales.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.4150, having hit a low
for the session of $1.4140, according to Reuters data, though
expectations of higher euro zone interest rates were expected to
cap falls.
 Traders were also wary ahead of a vote in Portugal on
austerity measures that could fail, setting the stage for a
possible collapse of the minority Socialist government.
 ""Euro/dollar will be sensitive to news coming from Portugal
and the rising possibility that Prime Minister Socrates is
forced to resign,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at
Unicredit in Milan.
 ""This will put the debt crisis story back under the
spotlight, the day before the EU leaders meeting tomorrow. But
(a likely) ECB rate hike in April should contain the negative
news for the euro,"" he said, adding that the euro is unlikely to
go any lower than $1.4050.
 Sterling was also under pressure, falling 0.6 percent to
$1.6277, with traders saying some were disappointed that Bank of
England minutes were no more hawkish than last month.
 The UK budget was also in focus. UK finance minister George
Osborne has billed the 2011/12 budget as one for growth, but
analysts are unsure how much he can do given a drive to bring
public finances under control.
 
 LIMITED FALLS
 The prospect of higher interest rates, combined with a sense
that there is a will among European policymakers to resolve the
euro zone debt crisis was expected to keep the euro supported
well above $1.40, however.
 ""Economically, the euro zone is showing clear signs of
recovery, politically the politicians are heading in the right
direction and expectations of the ECB raising rates favours the
euro over the U.S. dollar,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of
currency management at Investec Asset Management, which manages
just over $10 billion in currency funds.
 ""We hold an overweight position in the euro and will be
looking to buy on any dips if the euro corrects"".
 In another signal that interest rates could rise next month,
European Central Bank executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi
warned keeping rates very low amounted to an expansionary policy
that risked spurring excessive risk-taking.
 Other cues for traders could include continued tensions in
Libya and the Middle East. Against a backdrop of uncertainty and
broad aversion to taking on risk the Swiss franc was stronger,
as was the yen.
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at 114.59 yen and down 0.6
percent at 1.2746 Swiss francs, while the dollar also lost 0.3
percent to 0.9008 francs.
 Market participants were wary, however, of Japanese
authorities returning to sell the yen aggressively, particularly
below 80.50 yen per dollar, where they came in last Friday.

 (Adds details)
 BRUSSELS, March 23 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
take no decision at a summit later this week on how to
strengthen their multi-billion euro bailout fund, a move that is
likely to disappoint financial markets.
 It was expected that a summit on March 24/25 would agree on
whether guarantees should be used to increase the effective
capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to
440 billion euros ($624 billion) from about 250 billion euros,
but leaders have now put that decision off until mid-year.
 The delay is in part because of politics -- Finland has
dissolved its parliament ahead of an election and cannot take
any formal decisions at this time -- and partly due to the need
to coordinate with the setting up of the European Stability
Mechanism (ESM), a permanent fund to replace the EFSF in 2013.
 ""The preparation of the ESM treaty and the amendments of the
EFSF agreement, to ensure its 440 billion euro effective lending
capacity, will be finalised so as to allow national procedures
to be completed in good time for signature of both agreements at
the same time before the end of June 2011,"" draft conclusions
prepared for the March 24/25 summit read.
 The delay is likely to be a disappointment to financial
markets, because the summit had been built up as being a
definitive moment, with leaders finally taking the decisions
needed to get on top of the year-long debt crisis.
 The euro  hit a session low against the dollar after
the news that no decision would be taken.
 Sources said the summit was also unlikely to reach any
decision on lowering the interest rate on bailout loans provided
to Ireland, and that the Irish were not expected to give any
ground on their low corporate tax rate, which some other euro
zone member states want the Dublin government to increase.
 ""I fear Monday could be Black Monday for markets,"" one EU
financial source said, referring to the fact that the
Thursday-Friday summit is likely to produce much less than
financial markets have been built up to expect.

 By Julie Crust
 LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - Kazakh miner ENRC met forecasts
with full-year underlying profit that more than doubled, on
record production and demand recovery, and said the global
economic outlook was still improving.
 ""We remain positive on the group's prospects for 2011,
although the control of costs growth and the development of our
assets in Africa will be important issues for management, as
will be the continued near-term risk of commodity market
volatility,"" chief executive Felix Vulis said on Wednesday.
 Underlying 2010 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation (EBITDA) jumped 118 percent to $3.19 billion,
on revenue up 72 percent to $6.60 billion.
 ENRC has hired headhunters in its search for a new CEO,
Vulis told Reuters. Vulis, who has a 12-month notice period,
announced his resignation in February.
 Shares in the FTSE-100 miner were up 3.6 percent at 1045
GMT, slightly outperforming a 2.1 percent higher British mining
index.
 ENRC would not comment on speculation a publicly listed
Glencore could make a bid. It said it did not expect Glencore's
status, whether as a public or private company, to affect its
aluminium distribution agreement with the world's largest
commodities trader.
 Cost pressures have been rising across the mining industry
and ENRC said prices for materials, transportation, fuel and
other inputs, as well as logistics, were expected to show
significant increases in 2011. 
 The main driver of costs in 2011 will be higher input
material costs, chief financial officer Zaure Zaurbekova told
Reuters. ENRC said it will continue to focus on cost controls.
 Strong growth in developing economies was expected to
continue to underpin strong demand and pricing, it said, adding
output was expected to be maintained at full capacity.
 Production of ENRC's principal commodities -- high carbon
ferrochrome, iron ore, alumina, aluminium and coal -- were all
at record levels. It announced output data on Feb 2.
 ENRC, one of the world's biggest producers of ferrochrome, a
key ingredient in stainless steel, said the recent earthquake
and tsunami in Japan would likely hit demand for raw materials.
""The auto sector in Japan is still impacted by the disaster
and as long that goes on there has to be some impact on demand
for steel and stainless steel,"" chief commercial officer Jim
Cochrane told Reuters.
 ""Overall, stainless steel looks to be having a good year and
demand for ferrochrome has picked up ... and we are quite
optimistic about prices over the next three years,"" he said.
 South African group Merafe Resources, the country's largest
ferrochrome producer, said on Wednesday second-quarter European
benchmark ferrochrome prices will rise 8 percent from the first
quarter to $1.35 per pound.
 Cochrane said the iron ore market remained relatively tight.
 Also on Wednesday, London-listed iron ore producer Ferrexpo
said pretax profit surged in 2010 on record output and
significantly higher prices.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro slid on Wednesday as
investors were disappointed over delays to fine-tuning a euro
zone bailout fund, while bonds rallied as Portugal scrambled to
approve tough budget cuts.
 On the equity markets, renewed concern about the euro zone
debt crisis undermined European banking stocks while S&P 500
futures  were down 0.1 percent, indicating a weaker start
on Wall Street.
 Uncertainty over the longer-term impact of Japan's
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis boosted perceived safe
havens such as gold, government bonds and the Swiss franc. The
yen was steady but traders were wary of possible renewed
intervention to keep the Japanese currency in check.
The premium investors demand to hold Portuguese debt rather
than benchmark German bonds rose for a third day. The cost of
insuring the country's 5-year debt against default hit two-month
highs, reflecting the growing belief that Lisbon will follow
Greece and Ireland in seeking emergency funding if parliament
rejects a new series of austerity measures.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates has threatened to resign if the
package is rejected in a vote on Wednesday, meaning his minority
Socialist government could collapse a day before a key European
summit.
 ""If these measures are not agreed, it seems more and more
likely that Portugal will need some kind of support,"" said
Charles Diebel, head of market strategy at Lloyds Bank.
 ""Is this already reflected in the price? To a large degree,
yes it is, but there are also good causes for concern that this
is not going to stop here.""
 Any hopes that this week's European summit would yield a
decision on how to increase the effective capacity of the euro
zone bailout fund were dashed after the release of a draft
document prepared for the meeting. [ID:nBRU011391]
 Portugal's political crisis has knocked the euro from its
recent 4-1/2 month highs against the dollar, although the slide
is expected to be temporary, given the expectation for the
European Central Bank to raise interest rates next month.
 Five-year Portuguese credit default swaps (CDS) rose 8 basis
points to 538 basis points, their highest since Jan. 11,
according to data monitor Markit.

 The yen held steady, hugging a tight range close to 81 per
dollar, yet traders were wary that the Bank of Japan might step
in again if the dollar fell below 80.50, following Friday's rare
market intervention by major central banks to curb Japan's
currency.

 ZURICH, March 23 (Reuters) - Oerlikon, the struggling Swiss

 By Karen Lema	
 MANILA, March 23 (Reuters) - The Philippine central bank on
Wednesday signalled it may raise policy rates this week to
combat inflation in spite of concerns growth may slow due to
Japan's disaster and instability in the Middle East. 
 Governor Amando Tetangco stopped short of saying the era of
record low interest rates was coming to an end but noted the
need to keep inflation expectations in check. 
 He said any rate adjustment would be done gradually.	
 ""We have seen an uptick in inflation, we have also seen
inflation expectations tilt to the upside...so given all of
these developments the scope for maintaining interest rates has
clearly narrowed,"" Tetangco told reporters.	
 ""We will take the necessary pre-emptive action to make sure
that inflation expectations are not unhinged.""	
 Cayetano Paderanga, the country's economic planning chief,
told reporters separately the government may lower this year's
growth target range of 7 to 8 percent, which is above estimates
by most analysts as well as the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank.	
 Asked if the 2011 growth goal would be cut, Paderanga said:
""It could be, or it could be that you keep the same target but
allow for a wider range of possibilities.""	
 The government has said it needs more time to assess the
impact of a potential slowdown in trade and development loans
from disaster-stricken Japan, its major trading partner, and
reduced remittances from Filipinos working in the Middle East
and North Africa.	
 Tetangco said growth of 5 to 6 percent for the Philippines
this year would be ""reasonable."" The economy grew 7.3 percent in
2010, the fastest in more than three decades.	
 
 PRE-EMPTIVE ACTION	
 Analysts polled by Reuters this month said they expected the
central bank to raise the main interest rate by 25 basis points
from a record low of 4 percent when it reviews policy on
Thursday, with the 2011 inflation goal at risk of being
breached.	
 Policymakers forecast average 2011 inflation at 4.4 percent
and 3.5 percent in 2012 at the previous policy meeting in
February, but Tetangco said both estimates will be reviewed on
Thursday.	
 Manila is targeting an annual inflation rate of 3 to 5
percent for this year and again in 2012.	
 A benign inflation environment last year has allowed
the central bank to delay monetary tightening, leaving the
Philippines as the only major economy in Asia not to have lifted
rates since the end of the global financial crisis. 
 Tetangco said the economic landscape has changed this year,
with the global economic recovery gaining steam and emerging
markets, like the Philippines, facing mounting inflationary
pressures.	
 ""Economies abroad have started to recover...the conclusion
was that the global recovery is confirmed,"" Tetangco said.	
 ""At the same time we have inflation pressures here in the
Philippines and throughout the world, particularly in emerging
markets which have led the economic recovery,"" he said.

 SHANGHAI, March 23 (Reuters) - The yuan closed down slightly
against the dollar on Wednesday as market expectations of
further appreciation of the currency offset a weaker mid-point
set by the People's Bank of China.	
 In a sign of growing optimism that the government may let
the yuan rise further this year, Yang Jianlong, an economist at
the cabinet's Development Research Centre of the State Council,
forecast on Wednesday that the yuan could rise at least 5
percent in the year.	
 ""A 5-percent rise will be the bottom line for yuan
appreciation this year, while the upward limit will be higher,""
Yang told a forum in Beijing.	
 Lian Ping, the chief economist at Bank of Communications,
said in an article published by the official China Securities
Journal that now is a good time for China to let the yuan rise
faster because China's economy is expanding steadily while the
global economy still faces difficulties.	
 Some dealers said the weak dollar in global markets would
also pave the way for the PBOC to let the yuan rise gradually.
The dollar index is now hovering around a 16-month low.	
 ""The market remains confident that the yuan will appreciate
solidly this year,"" said a dealer at a major Chinese commercial
bank in Shanghai.	
 ""That confidence makes investors unwilling to bet on a sharp
pullback of the yuan even though the PBOC used its fixing today
to signal that the appreciation will only be gradual.""	
 The yuan closed at 6.5593 versus the dollar, down
slightly from 6.5561 at the close on Tuesday, when it hit an
all-time intraday high of 6.5552.	
 The currency has now risen 4.06 percent since it was
depegged in June 2010, and 0.46 percent so far this year.	
 Before trading began, the PBOC fixed the yuan's mid-point
at 6.5601, slightly weaker than Tuesday's record high
fixing of 6.5592.	
 The central bank has all along used a tactic of taking two
steps forward, one step back for yuan appreciation, partly to
frustrate speculators. It uses the fixing, from which the
dollar/yuan exchange rate may rise or fall 0.5 percent each day,
to express its intentions on the direction for the currency.	
 Benchmark one-year dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards
(NDFs) were bid at 6.4410 late on Wednesday, up
from 6.4300 at Tuesday's close. Their implied yuan appreciation
in a year's time fell to 1.84 percent from 2.02 percent.

(Adds Thai trader comments, Vietnam rice prices) 
 By Erik dela Cruz 
 MANILA, March 23 (Reuters) - The Philippines on Wednesday
agreed to import 200,000 tonnes of rice from Vietnam, a deal
expected to push up prices in the world's second-largest
exporter of the grain, but still below rival Thailand.	
 The Philippines state grains agency is seeking to bring in
this year's rice imports before the lean harvest season starts
in July. It is also in talks for a similar deal with Thailand,
the world's top exporter. 
 But traders in Thailand said they were unlikely to supply a
big portion of Manila's rice needs with Thai prices well above
those in Vietnam.	
 ""The Philippines is Vietnam's top buyer,"" said Chookiat
Ophaswongse, honorary president of the Thai Rice Exporters
Association.	
 ""Vietnam will do all means to retain the market share. And
with these prices I don't think Thailand could compete in this
market.""	
 The Philippines may be buying now as well, traders said,
because rice prices globally have lagged sharp gains made by
wheat, corn and soy earlier in the year as nations from Asia to
Africa looked to build grain stockpiles to tamp domestic food
inflation. 
 
 Manila's deal with Vietnam for 25 percent broken new crop
rice was priced at $480 a tonne, below a government budget of
$550 per tonne, cost and freight. But the price, translating to
$440-$450 a tonne on free-on-board (FOB) basis, is above current
levels in Vietnam. 
 On Wednesday, offers for the 25 percent broken rice, often
bought by the Philippines, rose to $410-$415 a tonne, FOB,
Saigon Port, before the news on the government deal, from
$400-$405 a tonne a week ago. 
 In Thailand's case, the price of Thai 15 percent broken
grade white rice, which the Philippines usually buys from its
Southeast Asian neighbour, was offered at $475-480 per tonne
FOB, above Vietnamese prices.	
 Manila's existing rice supply agreement with Vietnam covers
an annual supply of up to 1.5 million tonnes. The deal was
extended to 2013.

 VIETNAMESE PRICES SEEN RISING	
 ""We feel very strongly that we had a very good price for the
200,000 tonnes,"" Angelito Banayo, administrator of the National
Food Authority (NFA), told reporters, adding the shipment was
payable 270 days after arrival between April and June.	
 ""The Philippines got the best deal compared with other
countries in the Southeast Asian region,"" he said.	
 Vietnamese rice prices are expected to rise further in
coming weeks, with the market likely to target the price at
which the Philippines forged the deal with Hanoi, traders said.

 ""Production costs are rising in Vietnam so farmers will look
for every opportunity to raise prices,"" a trader at a foreign
company in Ho Chi Minh City said. 
 Anticipating the price rise, the Vietnam Food Association
has decided to raise by 2.2 percent the minimum export price for
the 25 percent broken grade to $470 a tonne, free-on-board,
effective March 24. 
 Also supporting Vietnam rice prices is steady demand from
China, which may have bought around 70,000 tonnes since
mid-January for commercial and reserve purposes, traders said.	
 Rice prices have so far kept well below the peak hit during
the 2008 food crisis, but rising food costs have triggered rate
hikes in most Asian countries as authorities seek to manage
inflation.	
 
 PRIVATE SECTOR IMPORTS	
 The Philippines' National Food Authority is holding a tender
for private sector rights to import 600,000 tonnes this year and
may announce a final import volume later on Wednesday. 
 The volume is part of the total 860,000 tonnes the
Philippines, the world's biggest rice buyer before huge import
cuts planned this year, is set to buy to boost buffer stocks.	
 Ahead of Wednesday's tender, several private firms from the
Philippines bought 25 percent broken rice from Vietnam at $420 a
tonne, FOB basis, at least 5 percent below the price of the
Manila-Hanoi rice deal, traders said.	
 ""Philippine private companies came and bought rice before
the tender,"" another trader in Ho Chi Minh City said.	
 Thai rice traders said they were likely to provide only a
small volume to Manila this year due to uncompetitive prices.	
 ""I think Thailand may sell around 50,000 tonnes at best this
year (to Manila),"" a Bangkok-based trader said. 
 The benchmark 100 percent B grade white rice 
was at $495 a tonne, down from last week's $500 per tonne due to
thin demand. .	
 NFA's Banayo said the Philippines, was in talks with
Thailand and Cambodia for a rice supply deal, with Bangkok
offering 1 million tonnes of annual supply for three years.

 Banayo said the government was unlikely to import more than
the 1.3 million-tonne ceiling set for this year, slightly more
than half of its record imports of 2.45 million tonnes in 2010.

 * Lower issuance to push down Swedish yields

 By Simon Johnson
 STOCKHOLM, March 23 (Reuters) - Sweden may come to face a
problem for which some debt-ridden euro zone states would gladly
swap their own woes - a consequence of serious debt-cutting.
 The worry for some professionals in Sweden's debt market is
that steadily reducing supply could shrink liquidity to the
point where the market can no longer function effectively.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg, representing a government
intent on cutting its debt burden further, dismisses such
concerns, saying ""no country in the world has had a problem with
too low debt"".
 However, some warn that driving Sweden's debt down too far
could deprive pension funds and banks of safe, long-term debt
paper, as well as dislocating a fund-raising mechanism the
country might need to tap again in some future crisis.
 ""If you pay off on the debt and make the outstanding volumes
less and less, you will have problems in the market,"" said Olof
Manner, Head of Scandinavian Rates Sales at RBS.
 Sweden's Debt Office reckons debt will hit 1 trillion crowns
($158 billion) by the end of 2013 -- below 30 percent of GDP --
from about 1.2 trillion at the end of 2010.
 By contrast, crisis-hit Ireland's debt will be around 110
percent of GDP at the end of 2013.
 The Nordic state has bounced back strongly from its 2009
recession. Gross domestic product rose 5.5 percent last year and
an output rise of more than 4 percent is expected for 2011.
 Such fundamentals have encouraged investors, leading to the
spread of Swedish 10-year paper over equivalent German debt to
narrow to about 10 basis points from 34 basis points at the
start of the year.
 But to keep investors happy, Sweden's market for its state
debt needs to be kept liquid even as the state is busy paying
back its borrowings.
 As Debt Office debt management head Thomas Olofsson recently
told Reuters, the first thing investors ask is how easy it is to
sell the securities after they have bought them.
 Liquid bond markets are also key for the smooth functioning
of the financial system.
 The yield curve from government bonds provides a pricing
benchmark. Banks also need high-quality debt as a capital buffer
with new, tougher rules likely to amplify this need. Pension
funds use long-term paper to match liabilities.
 The state might also have to borrow in a hurry, as it did in
the global crisis.
 ""We must be prepared to borrow a lot in a crisis and then it
is important to have low debt, but it is also important to have
an investor base and infrastructure,"" Olofsson said.
 ""If we continue to have large surpluses in the coming years,
sooner or later we would reach the point where liquidity would
be more difficult to support,"" he added.
 Olofsson gave the example of Denmark, where central
government debt fell to 11 percent of output by the end of 2008,
but doubled back to 22 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
in 2010 after the financial crisis ravaged its banks.
 Even in the fiscally strong years, the central bank, which
runs debt management for Denmark, chose to keep a functioning
debt market due to the costs of having to restart one from
scratch.

 YIELDS TO GO LOWER
 Analysts have calculated that were Sweden to continue paying
down its debt at the same rate as in the past 15 years, it would
be debt-free sometime in the 2020s.
 Should rating agencies downgrade more debt-laden euro zone
countries like Spain and Portugal, global investors are likely
to boost holdings of Swedish debt, further stretching supply.
 In the short term, this will make it cheaper for the
government to borrow.
 ""We think Swedish long-term yields could go a little bit
below German ... in the next 1-2 years,"" Knut Hallberg, analyst
at Swedbank said. ""The main reason for that is lack of supply.""
 Rating agency Moody's also views the trend as positive, with
Dietmar Hornung, Senior Credit Officer at Moody's Sovereign Risk
Group, saying falling levels of borrowing were good from a
creditworthiness point of view.
 Swedbank's Hallberg said outstanding debt needs to be more
than 800 billion crowns ($125.9 billion) for a liquid market.
 Debt Office head Bo Lundgren put the figure at 700-800
billion crowns with at least 50-60 billion outstanding in
benchmark issues.
 It will take some time to reach that level -- and that's if
demographic changes don't push budgets back into deficit soon.
 The Debt Office, which will hand the government a report on
the falling debt in late September, is unlikely to sit still.
 Its options include withdrawing or cutting back on some
parts of the debt market in order to focus on more liquid
instruments.
 For instance, it could reduce T-bill issuance further, cut
foreign currency borrowing or borrow on behalf of a wider client
base, such as local authorities.
 Increasing buybacks would also give room for new borrowing.
 T-Bill issuance is already expected to fall, as is foreign
borrowing, and the Debt Office has said it will focus issuance
on 5- and 10-year debt and probably hold fewer auctions ahead.
 Lundgren also told Reuters that debt levels of 30 percent of
GDP meant the government had flexibility to consider whether to
continue to pay off debt, or use the money for public investment
projects, though he stressed that was a political decision.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Naomi Tajitsu
 TOKYO/HONG KONG, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on
Wednesday, retreating from a 4 1/2-month high against the dollar
as worries about debt problems in Portugal and Ireland sapped
appetite for the currency and its near-term outlook is seen
hinging on whether Lisbon's make-or-break attempt to garner
parliamentary support for its austerity measures will succeed.
 Portugal's political crisis has quashed the latest rally in
the euro, which climbed to $1.4249 earlier this week, but some
analysts said any selling in the euro if the government fails
was unlikely to extend far below $1.41, given expectations EU
leaders are close to agreeing the details of a debt-rescue fund,
while euro zone interest rates are widely seen rising next
month.
 Lisbon's parliament will vote on the government's latest
austerity measures on Wednesday and Prime Minister Jose Socrates
has threatened to resign if the opposition fails to approve the
measures, setting the stage for a potential collapse of his
minority government a day before a European summit where leaders
are due to discuss steps to deal with debt problems.
[ID:nLDE72L1IO]
 ""The Portugal situation has put a spanner in the (euro's
rally) with the suggestion the government may fail today, and
the implication would be the resulting uncertainty would push
the country towards a bailout,"" said Robert Ryan, senior G10
currency strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.
 ""But would that come as a big surprise to the market? I
don't think so ... We could see a dip below $1.41 but I don't
think we will go to much further. The ECB has made it clear that
regardless of the situation with the periphery, they will go
ahead with a hike in April.""
 Also causing some uncertainty about the health of the euro
zone were rumours that Allied Irish Banks (AIB) , which
has been effectively nationalised, was planning to miss a coupon
payment, driving the premium that investors demand to hold Irish
two-year bonds to a euro-era high.
 AIB said in a statement that it would pay the coupon due on
Wednesday as scheduled.
 The euro traded at $1.4160 , 0.2 percent lower on the
day. A further slide was blocked by suspected bids from model
funds in the $1.4140/50 region, while an option barrier at
$1.4250 capped the euro's advance.
 On charts, the euro was poised for a pull-back to support at
$1.4030/50 -- intraday peaks from earlier this month -- but only
a drop below the $1.40 level would suggest a peak had been put
in place and its solid uptrend was reversing.
 The euro has rallied nearly 6 percent against the dollar so
far this year, and is hovering on the threshold of its highest
since January 2010. Given ongoing debt problems plaguing weaker
euro zone countries, some analysts anticipate a retreat in the
euro in the coming months, adding that current levels offered a
good chance to lock in profits.
 ""Given how strongly the euro has performed in the last few
weeks, uncertainty about Portugal could give people a reason to
take profits, and possibly sell it, so we would expect some
downward pressure from here,"" said Chris Gothard, head of FX for
Brown Brothers Harriman in Hong Kong, adding that a slide to
$1.4050 in the near term was possible.
 The European Central Bank is widely expected to raise its
benchmark rate by 25 basis points from a record low 1.0 percent
next month. Some in the market believe the euro's yield
advantage over the dollar will provide some cushion for the
currency, while others caution that monetary tightening while
weaker euro zone countries were suffering may spell trouble for
the single currency.
 Sterling  traded at $1.6362, holding near a 14-month
high hit on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected British
inflation data increased the chances of an interest rate rise
within the next few months. Traders said the pound may rise as
far as $1.65 if Bank of England minutes, due later in the day
show a more hawkish bias among policymakers.
 Investors were also anticipating the UK government's 2011
budget, to be announced on Wednesday, to see if it it will
bolster faltering growth without compromising on a tough
austerity programme to get public finances back in order.
 YEN STALLED
 The dollar  slipped a touch on the day to 80.90 yen,
but stuck close to 81.00 yen region as traders turned cautious
about buying the currency after the Group of Seven (G7)
countries sold it last week in their first joint intervention in
more than a decade.
 The G7 may have sold around 530 billion yen ($6.5 billion)
last Friday as they intervened to weaken the currency, data from
the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday, far less than the
approximately 2 trillion yen indicated by market talk.
[ID:nL3E7EM1IH]
 Market participants were wary of Japanese authorities
returning to sell the yen aggressively, particularly below 80.50
yen, where they came in last Friday. At the same time, few in
the market expected big gains in the dollar, adding that a rise
back to around 83 yen, where the dollar traded before Japan's
devastating earthquake, was unlikely.
 ""The G7 may have wanted to push the dollar/yen back to its
levels before its tumble last week but they won't try to push it
back to its levels before the earthquake. They'll leave it to
the markets from here,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at
Sumitomo Trust in Tokyo.
 Many in the market anticipate more downside in the dollar in
the coming days. Some traders say a slide under 80 yen is
possible, although a sharp fall below 79 yen before the end of
the month was unlikely due to wariness about possible
intervention.
 On the upside, heavy exporters' offers are already lined up
above 82.00 yen, with more seen around 83.00 yen, and an options
trader at a Japanese bank on Tokyo said he suspected the balance
of dollar/yen flows would be tilted towards dollar selling
during the last stretch of Japan's financial year, ending this
month, as Japanese exporters are likely to sell.
 The last week of March commonly sees a mix of dollar flows
including exporter selling and buying by investors related to
overseas investments in the new year. Still, market participants
have been speculating that such buying demand may be limited
this year given the recent drop in Japanese equities, which
could sap domestic investors' risk appetite.

 OITA, Japan, March 23 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan board member
Ryuzo Miyao said on Wednesday the central bank will take
appropriate policy action if necessary but offered few clues on
what specific action is in the works.	
 Miyao, the first BOJ policymaker to speak in public since
the devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the country's
northeast on March 11, repeated the line Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa has been presenting in parliament, adding that he
wanted to carefully examine future economic data to quantify the
impact of the quake.	
 Miyao, a lifelong academic and expert on monetary policy,
joined the board in March of last year. He is known for his
research on inflation targeting and some analysts say he doubts
the effectiveness of such a policy.	
 Following are key quotes from Miyao's speech to business
leaders in Oita, southern Japan, and from a news conference that
followed.	
 
 MONETARY POLICY	
 (from news conference)	
 ""To assist the smooth reconstruction of quake-hit areas, the
BOJ wants to consider what action it can take...	
 ""The BOJ will carefully examine future moves in the economy
and prices and take appropriate policy action if judged
necessary.	
 ""The BOJ's ample fund supply has been effective in
containing financial institutions' worries. It will continue to
supply ample funds based on demand.""	
 
 QUAKE IMPACT	
 (from news conference)	
 ""It is difficult at this stage to grasp the quantitative
impact of the earthquake.	
 ""The BOJ wants to carefully examine data due out in coming
days with utmost attention, while taking into account the
effects of the BOJ's additional easing last week and the
government's possible future steps.""	
 (from speech)	
 ""We need to be mindful that the quake's negative impact on
the economy at least on the supply side may be bigger than the
Kobe quake 16 years ago, and be prolonged.""	
 
 JGB UNDERWRITING	
 (from news conference)	
 ""Central bank underwriting of government bonds is not
allowed in many countries including emerging nations.	
 ""This is because history has taught us that once a central
bank starts underwriting government bonds, it eventually leads
to reckless issuance of the currency and causes inflation,
harming people's lives and the economy...	
 ""If the BOJ were to directly underwrite government bonds, it
would damage trust in the currency ... It is extremely important
to maintain trust in the currency.""

 * Manufacturers have long complained of yen's strength
 * Dearth of supplies, power outages add to concerns
 * Shift of production overseas could speed up

 By Nathan Layne and Tim Kelly	
 TOKYO, March 23 (Reuters) - Japan's triple disaster could
well provide the final nudge for companies to shift production
overseas and away from the risks that have sent a shudder
through the global supply chain.	
 A surge in the yen to a record high against the dollar only
adds to the case, reminding Japan's array of major export names
such as Toyota Motor Co and Sony Corp about
the currency risks of manufacturing in the country.	
 A shift in operations overseas would not be new. But the
combination of earthquake, tsunami and the crisis it spawned at
a nuclear power station could be a wake-up call for Japan Inc
that speeds up the process, analysts say.	
 ""The 'country risk' associated with producing in Japan has
risen,"" said Takahide Kiuchi, chief Japan economist at Nomura
Securities. ""You've got the earthquake and the nuclear crisis.
Add a stronger yen to the mix and there is a clear risk that the
hollowing-out of the manufacturing base will accelerate.""	
 
 That hollowing out has already seen overseas production by
Japanese companies rise from 6 percent of the total to 20
percent in the last two decades.	
 History suggests the trend will now speed up in the wake of
the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a 10-metre tsunami that left at
least 21,000 people dead or missing.	
 
 WHAT KOBE QUAKE SHOWS	
 In the three years after the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the ratio
of overseas-to-domestic production of Japanese companies rose
sharply -- to 11.6 from 8.3 -- a rise of more than a third. Soon
after the Kobe earthquake the yen rose to a record high that was
only surpassed last week in the wake of the latest earthquake.	
 The latest earthquake is a much bigger disaster. Japan's
economy and manufacturers bounced back quickly after the Kobe
quake, which produced an estimated $100 billion in damage.
Industrial production fell for a month and then grew for three
months. The economy continued to expand.	
 That produced expectations Japan could bounce back this time
as well. But those hopes faded quickly as the scale of the
crisis confronting Japan became apparent.	
 This time around, the cost of direct and indirect damage to
the world's third-biggest economy could exceed $250 billion, or
2-3 percent of gross domestic output, Economy Minister Kaoru
Yosano told Reuters in an interview.	
 Economists are also pencilling in a recession and a much
slower recovery as the loss of power supply, both nuclear and
thermal, means rolling power blackouts until Japan's
infrastructure is repaired.	
 Such is Japan's position in the global supply chains that
companies from Apple Inc , Nokia and General
Motors Co to miner Rio Tinto have felt the
impact.	
 In Japan, Sony said 16 plants out of a total of 25 have been
impacted by the disaster. The maker of the Playstation gaming
console said on Tuesday if shortages continued it will begin
temporarily shifting output to overseas sites where parts were
available. 
 Canon Inc has shut down its camera production at
least until Thursday and rival Nikon said it expected
to resume output at its north Japan plants by the end of March.	
 However, Nikon added that power cuts and parts shortages
made a return to full production uncertain.	
 
 A TEST OFR TOYOTA	
 Japan produces a fifth of the world's computer chips and
exported 7.2 trillion yen ($91 billion) worth of electronic
parts last year, research from Mirae Asset Securities shows.	
 Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker, said all 12 of its
Japanese assembly plants were shut down at least until March 26.	
 Among big carmakers, Toyota is most exposed to Japan. It
makes 38 percent of its cars in Japan, against about a quarter
for both Honda and Nissan .	
 It loses an outsized 30 billion yen in annual operating
profit for each one yen gain. The currency has risen from more
than 200 per dollar in 1985 to a record high last week of 76.25
per dollar. It now trades around 80 yen.
 The temblor ""underlines the fact that it's a competitive
disadvantage to having too much of your production base in
Japan,"" said Chris Richter, auto analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific
Markets.	
 Indeed, a post-disaster dearth of parts, labour and
electricity, plus a rising yen, may test Toyota's resolve about
maintaining such a production presence in Japan.	
 The head of Toyota, Akio Toyoda, promised in January to keep
building 3 million cars a year in Japan, although he also
complained about the strength of the yen.	
 ""(The dollar) has been in the 80s for a very long time, and
each company is doing its best to (withstand the pain). But if
this keeps up, we (Japan) can't fight to remain a manufacturing
base in the world,"" he told reporters at the time.	
 Convincing the likes of Toyota, Sony and others to keep
production in Japan will be a difficult challenge for the
debt-strapped government as it tries to work out how to finance
Japan's reconstruction.	
 It has promised to cut corporate tax -- at 40 percent the
highest among Group of Seven rich nations.	
 That could boost corporate profits but also reduce
government income, so making it more difficult to cut a public
debt that is double the size of the economy even before the
potential cost of reconstruction is included.	
 A pick up in production shifting overseas could also have
economic implications, although a fast ageing population means
Japan has one of the lowest unemployment rates among rich
nations.	
 To be sure, Japan has maintained a heatlhy trade surplus for
decades suggesting that the yen is not a major problem for the
economy. Any overseas profits repatriated to Japan would be
subject to the level of the yen as well.	
 In addition, shifting production is not without its risks.
China's currency the yuan, for example, has risen 23 percent
against the dollar since it was revalued in 2005.	
 Some countries have less than a stellar record on issues
such as legal enforcement of intellectual property or corporate
law in general. Corruption and social stability are issues in
many countries.	
 Still, the disaster has underlined the risks of being
located in an earthquake-prone zone, which won't have gone
unnoticed by the customers of Japanese exporters.	
 They may provide the pull on Japanese exporters to shift
more production overseas or at least to diversify geographically
within Japan. A failure to heed such calls could be costly, said
Campbell Gunn, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's Japan fund.	
 ""I don't think the stability and the quality arguments will
go away and therefore Japan still has an advantage in both
areas,"" he said. ""But I think most people will now default to
having two suppliers in two locations if they didn't before.""

 * Cbank deputy gov says comfortable with current rate levels	
 * Confident China can contain inflation at 4 pct this year	
 
 HONG KONG, March 23 (Reuters) - China is facing strong
inflationary pressure, but will tread cautiously in raising
interest rates, said Yi Gang, a deputy governor with the
People's Bank of China.	
 Yi told a business conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday that
he was confident the government would be able to keep annual
average consumer price inflation to 4 percent this year.	
 ""We will see high (inflation) numbers in the first half of
the year because of the base effect. Inflation in the second
half will be lower,"" Yi said. ""So for the whole year, we will be
able to meet the 4 percent goal.""	
 Chinese inflation topped expectations at 4.9 percent in the
year to February, near its fastest level in more than two years,
and looks set to accelerate further in coming months as the
economy races ahead and prices of food and commodities such as
oil remain high. 
 The deputy central bank chief said he was ""comfortable"" with
current interest rate levels, adding that raising them too high
would attract hot money inflows.	
 ""I think they (interest rates) are now at a comfortable
level. In a mid-term time horizon, we will maintain a positive
interest rate,"" Yi said.	
 ""And also you know that higher interest rates will attract
more hot money into China, so that is another consideration.""	
 Chinese officials fear rising speculative inflows, lured by
widening interest rate differentials and expectations of a
firmer yuan, could complicate their fight against inflation.	
 So far, the central bank has relied mainly on quantitative
tightening measures, notably hiking banks' reserve requirements,
to mop up excessive liquidity in the economy.	
 It has raised interest rates three times and bank reserve
requirements six times since October, most recently on March 18.
The government has also used a series of direct controls to cap
price rises.	
 China's monetary policy has become tighter compared to the
previous two years but the policy is not tight at all if
measured by the historical norm, Yi added.	
 The yuan has been allowed to rise about 4 percent
since it was depegged from the U.S. dollar last June, but has
gained just 0.5 percent so far this year.	
 Lian Ping, the chief economist at Bank of Communications,
said in an article published by the official China Securities
Journal that now is a good time for China to let the yuan rise
faster because China's economy is expanding steadily while the
global economy still faces difficulties. 
 In a sign of growing optimism that the government may let
the yuan rise further this year, Yang Jianlong, an economist at
the cabinet's Development Research Centre of the State Council,
forecast on Wednesday that the yuan could rise at least 5
percent in the year. 
 ""A 5-percent rise will be the bottom line for yuan
appreciation this year, while the upward limit will be higher,""
Yang told a forum in Beijing.

 That amount is far smaller than the approximately 2 trillion yen indicated by market talk,
although some analysts said the figure was not a surprise.

 By Mantik Kusjanto	
 WELLINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand's annual
current account deficit widened in the fourth quarter, but is
expected to show a sharp improvement in the near term as
insurance payments flow into the country to pay for rebuilding
after last month's earthquake.	
 The deficit for the year to Dec. 31 increased to NZ$4.38
billion ($3.2 billion) from a revised deficit of NZ$4.19 billion
for the year to Sept 30, equating to 2.3 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) compared with the forecast of 2.4 percent
in a Reuters poll. 
 The current account deficit is expected to narrow and the
balance may move to surplus in the short term as insurance
payouts start flowing to cover the estimated NZ$10 billion
($7.4 billion) cost of the Feb 22 which devastated Christchurch,
the country's second-largest city, and killed at least 166
people.	
 But the improvement is expected to be temporary as a pick-up
in growth on the back of reconstruction bolsters imports.	
 ""Looking at 2012, reconstructing Christchurch is going to
require a lot of imports and you've got to expect the current
account deficit will be out to 5 percent of GDP by the end of
next year,"" said Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs.	
 The New Zealand dollar fell to $0.7391/99 from about
$0.7404/13 before the data, before steadying around $0.7394,
while bank bills <0#NBB> were little changed.

 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand slashed interest rates by 50
basis points to 2.5 percent this month to restore confidence and
cushion the economy after the Christchurch earthquake.	
 The economy stalled in the second half of 2010, contracting
0.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter. Data
on Thursday is expected to show scant growth of 0.1 percent in
the fourth quarter, according to a Reuters poll, though some
analysts believe the country slipped back into recession.	
 
 DEFICITS	
 New Zealand's chronic current account deficit has been a
long standing concern for ratings agencies, more so recently
because of the higher global sensitivity to debt.	
 The current account deficit in the December quarter widened
to NZ$3.52 billion from a sharply revised NZ$29 million deficit
in the September quarter.	
 Statistics NZ revised the third quarter number from NZ$1.77
billion deficit after raising its insurance payment estimate
from offshore to NZ$3.6 billion from NZ$1.7 billion. 
 The annual balance showed an improving trade surplus, with
strong commodity exports and weak imports. Export volumes
rebounded from the third quarter, when drought hit agricultural
exports.	
 However, the investment deficit -- the gap between earnings
for foreign investors in New Zealand and the country's foreign
investments -- remained large at NZ$10.7 billion from NZ$10.8
billion in the third quarter. 
 The services deficit more than doubled for the year as
tourism receipts fell.	
 The central bank has forecast the annual current account
will post a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP by March 2011, as
insurance payments for earthquake damage swell . 
 But the gap is seen rising to 5.1 percent of GDP by March
2014 as the economy returns to normal growth, increasing imports
and investment earnings for foreigners. 
 ""We continue to expect ratings pressure,"" said RBC
strategist Michael Turner.	
 Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have both cut their
outlook for New Zealand's foreign-currency credit ratings to
negative from stable because of concerns about the country's
foreign debt mountain.	
 New Zealand relies heavily on foreign borrowing to fund its
deficits because of perennially low levels of household saving.
The government has said it wants to increase national savings.	
 The IMF said this week raising national saving through
fiscal consolidation is key to containing the rising current
account deficit.	
 New Zealand's net foreign liabilities fell to 81.7 percent
of GDP from 83.8 percent in the previous quarter as household
deposits increased and lending was subdued. By comparison
Australia's level is around 60 percent.

 * President to meet political parties Friday
 * Euro currency hit
 * Chances of bailout seen rising

(Recasts with resignation)
 By Daniel Alvarenga and Axel Bugge
 LISBON, March 23 (Reuters) - Portuguese Prime Minister Jose
Socrates resigned on Wednesday and warned of grave consequences
for the country after parliament rejected his government's
latest austerity measures aimed at avoiding a bailout.
 The move threw Portugal into uncertain political terrain
after months of battling against growing investor concerns over
its ability to tame its public finances and avoid following
Greece and Ireland to seek international aid.
 ""This political crisis has very grave consequences for the
confidence Portugal needs from institutions and the financial
markets,"" Socrates said.
 Socrates presented his resignation to President Anibal
Cavaco da Silva. 
 The president said in a statement that he would hold
meetings with all political parties on Friday and that the
government would retain full powers at least until then. That
leaves Socrates' government in place for the duration of a
European summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.
 The main opposition Social Democrats, who have previously
backed austerity, said they want an election, hoping that the
centre-right party's lead in opinion polls will bring it to
power.
 ""I am convinced that the road we will follow, the normal road
of democracy, is the path of giving the word back to the
Portuguese so as to choose a new, stronger government with more
confidence to beat the crisis,"" Social Democrat leader Pedro
Passos Coelho said. ""And that is what I'll tell the president.""
 The events in Portugal prompted the euro to extend losses
against the dollar after trading lower all Wednesday on wariness
before the Portuguese vote and on news of a delay in increasing
a euro zone bailout fund. Portuguese stocks fell and bond yields
shot up.
 The euro slipped to $1.4103 after the news from about
$1.4117 just before parliament voted and was down about 0.7
percent on the day.
 All opposition parties voted against the measures in the
230-seat parliament, where the Socialists have 97 seats.
 The government had hoped to obtain support for its plan
before Thursday's EU summit, to reduce market pressure on
Portugal's sovereign debt.
 The EU leaders, however, look set to disappoint investors by
delaying any approval of a beefed-up euro zone rescue fund till
June.
 Investors concerns could now grow as the country faces at
least several weeks of political uncertainty.
 Socrates said he would remain in power in a caretaker
capacity.
 ""The country will not be without a government. The
government will continue to fulfil all its duties as a caretaker
government,"" Socrates said.
 
 BOND YIELD UP
 The Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to 7.82
percent on Wednesday from Tuesday's 7.68 percent and the spread
over safer German Bunds rose 16 basis points to 459 bps. Many
economists see borrowing costs above 7 percent as unsustainable
and say Portugal will have to resort to the rescue mechanism.
 Shorter-dated bonds were harder hit, with Portugal's
five-year bond yield at a euro lifetime high of 8.3 percent
ahead of the vote.
 ""The prospect of a bailout has risen drastically and is now
enormous,"" said Filipe Garcia, head of Informacao de Mercados
Financeiros consultants in Porto, adding that Portugal has over
9 billion euros of maturing bonds through June.
 The constitution stipulates that the country can hold a snap
election no sooner than 55 days after the president calls one.
 ""My worry is the period of inaction before a new government
takes over,"" said Silvio Peruzzo, an economist at RBS in London.
 Political analyst Antonio Costa Pinto said a caretaker
government would have its hands tied.
 ""Although a caretaker government cannot take major
autonomous initiatives, it could take a decision on resorting to
aid if it is backed by parliament,"" Costa Pinto said.
 Whatever the outcome, opposition to austerity may increase
as the Portuguese face lower wages and higher taxes, and the
country returns to recession.
 Large protests have been held against austerity on the past
two weekends and on Wednesday train drivers went on strike to
demand higher wages, creating traffic chaos around Lisbon as
commuters were forced to take their cars to work.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, March 23 (Reuters) - Uncertainty over the human
and economic damage inflicted by Japan's earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis weighed on Asia stocks on Wednesday, and the euro
eased ahead of a parliamentary vote in Portugal that could see
the government fall.	
 Major European share markets were expected to open down
around 0.4 percent, according to financial bookmakers in London,
while S&P 500 futures fell 0.3 percent, pointing to a
weaker start on Wall Street. 
 Oil was steady, after gaining on Tuesday as violence in
Libya and unrest in Yemen fuelled worries of supply disruptions.
Turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East also supported
safe-haven demand for gold.	
 
 Japan's Nikkei fell 1.7 percent as investors took
profits from a two-session bounce. Japanese stocks remain around
8 percent below their close on March 11, the day northeast Japan
was struck by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and 10-metre tsunami.	
 The disaster left more than 23,000 people dead or missing,
crippled a nuclear power plant that has been leaking radiation
and hit production at major companies such as Sony Corp
and Toyota Motor .	
 A Japanese government report estimated the material damage
from the disaster at around $200-$300 billion and said planned
power outages would have a ""significant"" additional impact.

 ""It's not that the market is ignoring fundamentals,"" said
Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Inc. ""We just simply
don't know them yet, as many companies are still gathering
information about damage sustained during the disasters.""	
 Underlining the continuing risks, the United States became
the first country to block food imports from parts of Japan due
to radiation fears. 
 
 CAUTION PREVAILS	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was flat, weighed down by the Japan crisis and
following falls on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial
average lost 0.2 percent and the S&P 500 fell 0.4
percent. 
 ""It's fairly evident that while we have had added strength
in our market, there is still caution out there, with the view
that markets are not going to race up in any great hurry,"" said
Jamie Spiteri, senior dealer at Shaw Stockbroking in Australia.	
 Nervousness and volatility in the stock market supported
Japanese government bonds, with benchmark 10-year futures
rising 0.33 point to 139.73, while the 10-year yield
fell 3 basis points to 1.215 percent.	
 ""The incident is likely to slow Japan's economic growth, so
markets are expected to factor this in,"" said Akito Fukunaga,
chief fixed-income strategist at RBS Securities.	
 ""I think the influence of the economic slowdown surpasses
worries over Japan's fiscal position in the JGB markets.""	
 
 PORTUGAL CRISIS	
 Portugal's parliament was due to vote on the minority
Socialist government's latest austerity measures on Wednesday,
with Prime Minister Jose Socrates threatening to resign if the
opposition rejects the proposals. 
 ""If Prime Minister Socrates steps down, Portugal will likely
ask the European Union and the IMF for help, which is likely to
trigger a bit of euro selling,"" said Junya Tanase, chief
strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo.	
 The euro traded around $1.4165 , off a four-month high
near $1.4250 reached on Tuesday.	
 Also weighing on the euro were rumours that Allied Irish
Banks , which has been effectively nationalised, was
planning to miss a coupon payment, driving the premium that
investors demand to hold Irish 2-year bonds to a euro-era high.	
 AIB said in a statement it would pay the coupon due on
Wednesday as scheduled.	
 The yen remained little moved over the past 24 hours,
hugging a tight range close to 81 per dollar. Traders were wary
the Bank of Japan might step in again if the dollar fell below
80.50, following Friday's rare market intervention by leading
central banks to curb the currency's strength.	
 Last week, expectations the cost of quake reconstruction
would prompt insurance firms and others in Japan -- a big net
creditor to the rest of the world -- to repatriate yen drove the
Japanese currency to a record 76.25 per dollar before the Group
of Seven launched the first coordinated intervention since 2000.	
 Oil edged down a touch, after gaining on Tuesday as fighting
in producer Libya and unrest in Yemen, which neighbours top
producer Saudi Arabia, fuelled worries of supply disruptions.
Brent crude eased 0.3 percent to $115.44.	
 ""The market is still very vulnerable to further disruptions
to supply,"" said Tetsu Emori, a Tokyo-based commodities fund
manager at Astmax Investments. ""People are quite nervous about
the current turmoil spreading to Saudi Arabia.""
Spot gold was steady around $1,427.35 an ounce.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro hovered below a 4
1/2-month high on Wednesday as worries about debt problems in
Portugal and Ireland sapped appetite for the currency and its
near-term outlook is seen hinging on whether Lisbon's
make-or-break attempt to garner parliamentary support for its
austerity measures will succeed.
 Portugal's parliament will vote on the government's latest
austerity measures on Wednesday and Prime Minister Jose
Socrates has threatened to resign if the opposition fails to
approve the measures, setting the stage for a potential
collapse of his minority government a day before a European
summit where leaders are due to discuss steps to deal with debt
problems. [ID:nLDE72L1IO]
 ""If Prime Minister Socrates steps down, Portugal will
likely ask the European Union and the IMF for help, which is
likely to trigger a bit of euro selling,"" said Junya Tanase,
chief strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo.
 ""But any Portuguese aid package is likely to be much
smaller than those for Greece and Ireland. In addition, markets
have already been expecting that Portugal will need outside
help, so the euro's fall will probably be limited,"" he added.
 The euro traded at $1.4186  in early Asian trade, off
Tuesday's high of $1.4249, which was its highest since it
peaked out at $1.4283 in early November. An option barrier at
$1.4250 helped to block the euro's advance.
 Also casting cold water on the euro were rumours that
Allied Irish Banks (AIB) , which has been effectively
nationalised, was planning to miss a coupon payment, driving
the premium that investors demand to hold Irish two-year bonds
to a euro-era high.
 AIB said in a statement that it would pay the coupon due on
March 23 as scheduled.
 Still, the euro's yield advantage over the dollar is likely
to provide some cushion for the currency, analysts said.
 ""The euro is so close to its November peak that its rally
will inevitably slow. You will need a certain amount of energy
to break that level, although I think the euro will eventually
rise above that level,"" said Teppei Ino, currency analyst at
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The pound held near a 14-month high hit on Tuesday after
stronger-than-expected British inflation data increased the
chances of an interest rate rise within the next few months.
 Sterling traded at $1.6370 , near Tuesday's high of
$1.6403, and traders said more gains could be in store for the
pound with a rise as far as $1.65 if Bank of England minutes,
due out on Wednesday, show a more hawkish bias among
policymakers.
 The yen moved little over the last 24 hours, sitting still
near 81.00 to the dollar , as traders turned cautious
about buying the currency after the Group of Seven (G7)
countries sold it last week in their first joint intervention
in more than a decade.
 The market will be wary of intervention particularly below
80.50 yen, where the Bank of Japan came in last Friday. On the
other hand, heavy offers from Japanese exporters are seen lined
up above 82.00 yen.
 The G7 may have sold around 530 billion yen ($6.5 billion)
last Friday as they intervened to weaken the currency, data
from the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday. [ID:nL3E7EM1IH]
 That amount is far smaller than the approximately 2
trillion yen indicated by market talk, although some analysts
said the figure was not a surprise.
 ""Our interpretation is that the signalling effect from
'coordinated intervention' did most of the job for the BoJ in
the short run. Nevertheless, we judge that the BoJ is likely to
be ready for more persistent operations, should they be
needed,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at
Nomura in New York.

 By Antoni Slodkowski and Natsuko Waki	
 TOKYO, March 23 (Reuters) - Japanese shares fell on
Wednesday after the previous day's four-percent rally, while
government bond futures ticked higher as investors paused to
assess the economic damage from this month's earthquake and
tsunami.	
 Investors focused on the cost of the disaster that is set to
exceed the 10 trillion yen from the Kobe earthquake in 1995,
with Tokyo shares failing to extend Tuesday's rally, led by
foreigners who were encouraged by progress in containing
radiation leaks at a nuclear plant.	
 The Nikkei newspaper reported the government expects total
damage from the quake that hit northeast Japan to reach 15-25
trillion yen ($185-310 billion). 
 Investors are also monitoring the impact on production from
the quake. Sony said on Tuesday it was cutting
output at five more plants and Toyota Motor said
it was delaying restarting assembly lines. 
 ""The market is still extremely volatile, so I wouldn't be
surprised if the market loses much more today,"" said Norihiro
Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities.	
 He added that a combination of concerns on the impact of the
tsunami and earthquake, cuts in electricity supply and rising
oil prices were set to pressure Japan stocks.	
 The Nikkei average fell 1.4 percent to 9,471.79 ,
slipping below a key support level at 9,500. The broader TOPIX
index lost 1 percent to 859.80.	
 Nikkei futures traded in Osaka dropped 1.4 percent at 9,390
. Benchmark Japanese government 10-year bond futures
rose 0.2 point to 139.61.	
 The dollar fell around 0.15 percent to 80.93 yen , off
last week's peak of 82.00 yen set after the world's major
central banks intervened to stem export-damaging strength in the
Japanese currency.	
 Data from the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday the Group of
Seven countries may have sold a total of around 530 billion yen
on Friday, far smaller than market talk.

they will oppose the budget unveiled on Tuesday by the minority
Conservative government. That makes it all-but-certain that
Canadians will head to the voting booth this spring, because
the government needs one opposition party to support the
measure to avoid calling an election.
 Here is a look at Canada's major political parties.
 CONSERVATIVE PARTY
 The Conservatives under Prime Minister Stephen Harper were
elected as a minority government in 2006 and re-elected with a
slightly stronger minority in 2008. The current party was
formed from the 2003 merger of the former Progressive
Conservative Party and the western Canadian-based Canadian
Alliance that helped unite Canada's factious right wing. Polls
have shown the Conservatives with a comfortable lead over the
other parties, but just shy of what they would likely need to
win a majority government that does not need opposition support
to stay in power. But Harper has fought accusations in past
elections that he would pursue far more right-wing policies if
he had majority power. The Conservatives promise to keep the
economy on a steady keel, eliminating the budget deficit in
four years and not raising taxes.
 LIBERAL PARTY
 Sometimes called Canada's ""natural governing party"" because
of their long periods in power, the party promotes itself as
progressive on social social policies, but with tight fiscal
management. A spring vote would be the first test of leader
Michael Ignatieff, who became leader after the Liberal's poor
performance in the 2008 campaign. Ignatieff has fared poorly in
voter surveys, and has been the subject of Conservative attack
advertisements. The Liberals helped keep the Conservatives in
power since 2008 as the party worked to rebuild its finances
and internal organization. They promise to boost social
spending and pay for it by revoking corporate tax cuts.
 BLOC QUEBECOIS
 The Bloc Quebecois's purpose is independence for
French-speaking Quebec. It only runs candidates in Quebec, but
enjoys far more support there than the other major parties with
left-leaning economic and social policies, and is again
expected to win the majority of the seats there.
 NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 The New Democrats are to the left of the Liberals on the
political spectrum, but were was seen as the party most likely
to support the Conservatives in the budget fight. But the NDP
said the budget failed to meet some of its key demands for
helping senior citizens and middle-class families. The party
also opposes the Conservative corporate tax cuts. The NDP faces
an extra campaign hurdle in that leader Jack Layton. Layton is
recovering from prostate cancer and underwent hip surgery in
early March.
 GREENS
 The Green Party, which stresses environmental policy, does
not have any seats in Parliament. Polls have shown it winning
nearly 10 percent of voter support, which in some close races
could have an impact on how the parties fare even if the Greens
again win no seats themselves under Canada's first past the
post voting system.

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2011 07:33PM ET</span>",Portugal government may collapse before EU summit," * Parliament likely to reject austerity measures
 * PM has vowed to quit if plan is defeated
 
 By Andrei Khalip
 LISBON, March 23 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament is
expected to reject the government's latest austerity measures on
Wednesday, setting the stage for the possible collapse of the
minority Socialist administration a day before a European
summit.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates has said he will resign if the
plan is defeated. He has said its rejection would force Portugal
to follow Greece and Ireland and seek an international bailout,
which he opposes.
 All opposition parties have proposed resolutions calling for
the rejection of the measures, which reduce pensions and state
spending.
 The main opposition Social Democrats, who have previously
backed austerity, have begun talking about a snap election.
 ""It is quite clear now that the main opposition party is not
prepared to accept any political pact with the government over
the measures and it is very likely that the government will
fall,"" said political analyst Antonio Costa Pinto.
 The Socialists have 97 of parliament's 230 seats and have no
allies on whom they can rely. The plan needs at least 116 votes
to pass.
 A last-minute intervention by President Anibal Cavaco Silva
in the crisis appears less likely after he said late on Tuesday
his ""room for manoeuvre to act preventively"" was limited.
 The government had hoped to obtain support for its plan
before Thursday's EU summit, which is expected to approve a
beefed-up euro zone rescue fund.
 
 BOND YIELD UP
 Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to 7.68 percent
on Tuesday from Monday's 7.53 percent and the spread over safer
German Bunds rose 13 basis points to 443 bps. Many economists
see borrowing costs above 7 percent as unsustainable and say
Portugal will have to resort to the rescue mechanism.
 ""The idea and concept that the austerity may be thrown out
and the government may fall is undoubtedly not what bond holders
want to hear,"" said Peter Chatwell, debt strategist at Credit
Agricole in London.
 He said bonds would probably be further affected by the
""spooky effect on the horizon"", but added that the effects would
be limited if the market believed ""the next government will be
strong enough to keep the debt under control"".
 The Social Democrats, ahead in opinion polls, are broadly
committed to reducing the budget deficit.
 The constitution stipulates that the country can hold a snap
election at the earliest 55 days after one is called by the
president. Meanwhile, the outgoing government remains in office
as a caretaker administration with limited powers.
 ""My worry is the period of inaction before a new government
takes over,"" said Silvio Peruzzo, an economist at RBS in London,
adding that he did not expect decision-making to come to a
standstill, preventing the country from seeking a bailout if it
needed one urgently.
 Costa Pinto added: ""Although a caretaker government cannot
take major autonomous initiatives, it could take a decision on
resorting to aid if it is backed by parliament.""
 Political analysts expect the Social Democrats to revive
their coalition with the smaller right-wing CDS-PP party, after
a possible election, to guarantee a full majority in parliament.
 The Social Democrats have said they do not rule out seeking
a bailout if they are elected, if such aid were unavoidable to
enable Portugal to recover from its economic difficulties.

with a host of treats offered to opposition parties in the hope
of avoiding an election.
 But the three opposition parties all said they would vote
against the plan, likely forcing an election in May unless the
Conservatives change the budget.
 The currency  closed at C$0.9799 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0205, little changed from its Monday close of
C$0.9797, or $1.0207.
 But it later edged as low as C$0.9815 to the U.S. dollar,
or $1.0188, after the New Democratic Party joined the Liberals
and Bloc Quebecois in rejecting the budget.
 In fiscal plan, the Conservatives pledged to slice the
federal deficit by a quarter this year and return to surplus in
2015. [ID:nCFB004022]
 ""All in all, it looks like a budget that's not making major
changes, and certainly not trying to make enemies. The real
test for the Canadian dollar is just the palatability to the
other parties,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist
at Scotia Capital.
 The minority Conservative government looks set to face at
least two parliamentary confidence votes this week and the
chances of it surviving beyond Friday are uncertain at best.
 That could play havoc with the Canadian dollar, which has
been contending with movements in commodity price and
developments in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan.
 ""The Canadian dollar has no predictable pattern around
elections. We'll just see how it plays out,"" said Mark
Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy
at RBC Capital Markets. ""There's no reason for markets to get
up in much of an uproar about it.""
 Earlier, unexpectedly soft retail sales for January and a
rise in the leading indicator for February offered mixed
signals on the direction of the economy and reinforced
expectations that the Bank of Canada will be in no hurry to
raise interest rates. [ID:nN22151534]
 Primary-dealer forecasts for a rate increase were largely
split between the central bank's May 31 and July 19 policy
announcement dates, according to a Reuters poll last week. But
market pricing remains trained on an October bet.
[ID:nN18126761]
 While the retail sales figures may weigh, analysts largely
say the economy can still beat Bank of Canada forecasts for 2.5
percent growth in the first quarter, fed by a jump in wholesale
trade and manufacturing shipments in January and in spite of
benign inflation.
 ""With the bank expecting 2.5 percent, that means the output
gap is closing much faster than they were thinking. That does
put the impetus on them to hike rates even if you have
inflation relatively low,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, an economist
at BMO Capital Markets.
 BONDS HOLD GAINS
 Canadian bond prices were little changed following the
budget, holding gains across the curve as North American stock
markets were slightly softer on the day.
 Ottawa also built a cushion against future financial market
crises into its debt management strategy, proposing to borrow
an additional C$35 billion for a ""prudential liquidity"" buffer
in case of disruptions in funding markets. [ID:nCFB004026]
 ""We had not explicitly accounted for anything like that so
we had expected gross issuance closer to C$70 billion. In terms
of what it means for the market, I think some of shock impact
will be offset because it is going to be somewhat matched with
other assets on the other side,"" said Chandler.
 He said the the skewing of issuance in the shorter-dated
maturities could push the market towards a flatter curve.
 The two-year bond  was up 2 Canadian cents to
yield 1.673 percent, while the 10-year bond  gained
22 Canadian cents to yield 3.190 percent.

(Recasts, adds quotes, background)
 By Randall Palmer and Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, March 22 (Reuters) - A Canadian federal election
looked inevitable on Tuesday after all three opposition parties
said they would vote against the minority Conservative
government's latest budget.
 If they go ahead with that threat, or vote against the
Conservatives on another big issue, the government will fall
within the next week, paving the way for an early May election
-- Canada's fourth federal vote in less than seven years.
 An election campaign will pit Conservative assurances that
only they can be trusted to manage an economy that is still
emerging from recession against opposition charges of
government sleaze and waste.
 Polls point to Prime Minister Stephen Harper easily
retaining power, although he may not win enough support to
transform his minority right-of-center government into a
majority one that cannot be easily defeated. [ID:nN14139302]
 Finance Minister Jim Flaherty -- who dismissed the idea of
rewriting the budget to respond to opposition criticism -- had
added several inducements to win the support of the
left-leaning New Democrats, seen as the opposition party most
likely to vote with the Conservatives.
 But NDP leader Jack Layton refused to take the bait.
 ""We looked at this budget very carefully. We set out
clearly where we wanted the budget to go and Mr Harper chose
not to take us there,"" he said.
 The Conservatives, who back low taxes and stress the need
to cut the deficit, say Canadians don't want an election, a
view that's also borne out in opinion polls.
 That said, opposition parties are confident they can
benefit from a series of ethical problems facing the
Conservatives.
 This week a special Parliamentary committee slapped the
government with the first contempt ruling in Canada's history,
deciding that the government had hidden the full costs of a
spending program. [ID:nN21299652]
 NOT A CREDIBLE BUDGET
 Michael Ignatieff, leader of the main official opposition
party, said the budget was not credible.
 ""We're forced to reject the budget and we're also forced to
reject a government that shows so little respect for
parliamentary democracy and our democratic institutions,"" he
told reporters.
 The party will decide on Wednesday whether to propose a
vote of non-confidence in the government, and that could take
place on Friday. [ID:nN22196208]
 Layton's rejection came as something of a surprise, since
he was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year and had hip
surgery this month. He dismissed the suggestion that his
ailments would hinder a typically energetic campaigning style.
 The campaign is also bound to focus on ethics. Last week
police were asked to investigate allegations of misconduct by a
former top Harper aide.
 Last month, four Conservative officials were charged with
violating financing rules during the 2006 election campaign
that brought the party to power with a promise to stamp out the
sleaze that had surrounded the previous Liberal government.
 The party won a minority in early 2006 and retained power
in October 2008, again with a minority that needed support from
at least one opposition party to stay in power.
 The Canadian dollar dipped on the news of a likely
election, edging as low as C$0.9815 to the U.S. dollar, or
$1.0188, from C$0.9799 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0205 earlier.
 Canada emerged from recession in a far better fiscal shape
than most other big industrialized countries even though the
budget deficit hit a record C$55.6 billion last year as the
government primed the economic pump.
 But the gap looks paltry compared to the record US$1.645
trillion shortfall the United States faces in 2011, and
austerity measures Flaherty had planned are far less severe
than those planned by the British coalition government, for
example.

 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, March 22 (Reuters) - Canada's ruling Conservatives
pledged on Tuesday to slice the budget deficit by a quarter
this year and return to surplus in 2015, while offering a host
of treats to opposition parties in the hope of avoiding an
election.
 The opposition Liberals and Bloc Quebecois immediately said
they would vote against the budget. But the minority
Conservative government, which relies on an increasingly
antagonistic opposition to pass major legislation, may have to
wait until Wednesday to find out whether it has done enough to
win the backing of the third opposition party -- the New
Democrates -- and pass the budget.
 The three parties have ramped up attacks on the government
of Prime Minister Stephen Harper in recent weeks over ethical
breaches, fueling speculation they would seek to topple him as
early as this week in a confidence vote.
 ""To secure our recovery from the global recession, Canada
needs a principled, stable government. Now is not the time for
instability,"" Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in his budget
speech.
 Strong economic growth is helping narrow the budget gap
slightly more in the next five years than the government
predicted last October. Canada's deficit looks paltry compared
to the record US$1.645 trillion shortfall the United States
faces in 2011, and austerity measures planned are far less
severe than those planned by the British coalition government,
for example.
 But Flaherty embedded extra cautious economic outlook into
his fiscal plan and left intact his prediction of a return to a
small surplus in 2015-16.
 ""From an economics policy perspective, this budget I think
is pretty much what people were looking for going into it, but
it does seem to be heavily tilted towards a political budget as
well,"" said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of
Canada.
 The new spending plan in theory makes it difficult for at
least one party -- the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP)
-- to object as it includes measures that appear to be lifted
directly from the NDP budget wish list. 
 Polls show the Conservatives would retain power in an
election.
******************************************************************* Timeline: crucial week for Canadian government:
[ID:nN17163250] Interactive graphic on G7 government debt:
http://r.reuters.com/set58r
*************************************************************** 
 Because it holds a minority of seats in Parliament, the
Conservative government needs the support of at least one
opposition party to pass key legislation and stay in power. 
 The main opposition Liberals have made it clear they won't
back the budget, which completely ignored their main demand
that corporate tax cuts be reversed. The separatist Bloc
Quebecois' requests were not met either.
 NDP leader Jack Layton had conditioned his support for
Harper on more help for poor seniors, tax relief on home
heating bills, a beefed-up state pension plan and more family
doctors.
 Flaherty told reporters he had tried to take into account
the many demands made of him but added: ""The job of the
government is not to appease opposition parties.""
 The budget items that most obviously court the NDP were
more income support for low-income seniors at a cost of C$300
million a year, renewal of a program that reimburses Canadians
who make energy-efficient home renovations for C$400 million,
and student loan forgiveness for doctors and nurses who work in
rural Canada. It also proposes a tax credit for people who miss
work to care for elderly family members, which will cost C$200
million over two years. 
 ""I am surprised by the sheer volume of measures, mostly
fairly small but they do add up next year to C$2.3 billion, so
it's significant,"" said Don Drummond, economic adviser to
Toronto-Dominion Bank and a former finance official. 
 Businesses got some help too, in the form of a two-year
extension of the accelerated capital cost allowance for
investment in manufacturing and equipment and a tax credit for
small businesses to hire new workers. 
 CLOSING THE GAP
 The government opted to err on the side of caution in its
economic and fiscal projections, lowering the private sector
forecasts of gross domestic product growth used as budget
assumptions, citing Europe's debt woes and the catastrophic
earthquake and nuclear disaster in Japan. 
 After a decade of surpluses and boasting the strongest
fiscal reputation in the G7, Canada fell into deficit during
the global financial crisis. Flaherty has vowed to keep cutting
taxes and rely on the withdrawal of a stimulus program and
spending restraint to balance the books in the medium term.
 The budget foresees the federal deficit narrowing in the
2011-12 fiscal year to C$29.6 billion, or 1.7 percent of GDP,
compared with C$29.8 billion in its previous forecast in
October, down more than 25 percent from an estimated C$40.5
billion gap in 2010-11 period ending March 31. 
 The deficits in subsequent years are slightly smaller as
well, returning to a surplus of C$4.2 billion, or 0.2 percent
of GDP, in 2015-16. Ottawa sees the economy growing 2.9
percent this year and 2.8 percent next year.
 The government, which has already cut spending through a
strategic review of programs, said it hopes to squeeze out an
additional C$11 billion in savings between now and 2016.
 Ottawa also built in a cushion against future financial
market crises into its debt management strategy, proposing to
borrow an additional C$35 billion for a ""prudential liquidity""
buffer in case of disruptions in funding markets.

 (Updates prices, details)
 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - The euro eased back after
hitting a 4-1/2-month high against the dollar on Tuesday but
expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month could
limit any downside for the single currency.
 Sterling climbed to a 14-month high against the dollar,
also on expectations of an interest rate hike in coming months
after stronger-than-expected UK inflation data.
 The yen traded in a tight range, hovering around 81 per
dollar. In the near term, analysts said the 80-area could serve
as a floor, as markets were wary of further intervention by the
Group of Seven nations to counter yen strength after Japan's
earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis. For details,
see [ID:nL3E7EL23A]
 The euro climbed as high as $1.4249  on trading
platform EBS but gave up gains after running into
options-related barriers at about $1.4250. Further resistance
is seen around $1.4280, the November high.
 With the European Central Bank widely expected to raise
interest rates next month, traders said the euro may make
another run at those levels. The currency also found support
after euro zone officials agreed on Monday on the setup of a
permanent euro zone bailout fund.
 ""We continue to expect euro to test up to the November high
of 1.4282 as we believe that recent developments have all been
negative for the U.S. dollar and positive for the euro,"" said
Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 The euro  last traded at 1.4199, down 0.2 percent
on the day. Technical analysts at Citigroup said they expect a
test of the $1.48-$1.51 area in the near term. The euro hit
around $1.5144 back in November 2009.
 German two-year bond yields have risen about 30 basis
points over the past week to 1.75 percent, widening the gap
over U.S. Treasury yields to about 110 basis points.
 The euro zone's permanent bailout fund, the European
Stability Mechanism, will be backed by paid-in and callable
capital and offer loans more cheaply than the temporary
facility does now, a euro zone source said. The comprehensive
package is to be approved by EU leaders on March 24-25.
 YEN SUBDUED
 The Group of Seven countries may have sold a total of
around 530 billion yen ($6.5 billion) last Friday as they
intervened in forex markets to weaken the Japanese currency,
data from the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday. [ID:nL3E7EM1IH]
 The amount is far smaller than market talk indicating they
could have sold around 2 trillion yen, though some analysts
said the figure was not a surprise.
 ""Our interpretation is that the signaling effect from
'coordinated intervention' did most of the job for the BoJ in
the short run. Nevertheless, we judge that the BoJ is likely to
be ready for more persistent operations, should they be
needed,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at
Nomura in New York.
 Ihab Salib, senior portfolio manager and head of
international fixed-income at Federated Investors in
Pittsburgh, said in the medium-term, authorities may try to
drive the dollar/yen to levels around 85 and 86.
 ""I don't have a high degree of comfort that they'll be able
to change the longer-term trend of a stronger yen. But in the
short- to medium-term, I think they will succeed,"" Salib said.
 Federated Investors manages about $350 billion in assets.
Salib oversees more than $3 billion.
 Japan again warned it would act to keep the yen in check,
but traders saw no action in the FX market on Tuesday from
Japanese or other G7 authorities. That resolve could be tested
if dollar/yen looks like it will break back below 80 yen. 
 The dollar last traded at 80.90 yen , down 0.2
percent on the day and near the low end of the day's narrow
range of 80.85-81.29 yen on EBS.
 Sterling added 0.5 percent at $1.6379  after
British inflation last month surged to a 28-month high of 4.4
percent, reviving speculation the Bank of England will not wait
much longer to raise interest rates. [ID:nLDE72L0TT]

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. crude prices jumped on
Tuesday as unrest in Yemen raised concerns about a further
threat to supply and as the dollar traded near 15-month lows
against major currencies.
 Expectations that interest rates will rise in Europe before
they do so in the United States weighed on the dollar. Although
the euro eased back after hitting a 4-1/2-month high against
the dollar, expectations of a euro zone rate hike next month
could limit any downside for the single currency.
 And UK inflation data on Tuesday fueled expectations of a
British rate hike in coming months, driving sterling to a
14-month high against the greenback.
 Stocks in the United States and Europe fell slightly, with
the recent rally keeping in check the worries over the crises
in Japan and Libya.
 ""The combination of Japan getting better and some progress
in Libya has been enough to get people interested again,"" said
Perry Piazza, director of investment strategy at Contango
Capital Advisors in San Francisco. ""That said, there's still a
lot of uncertainty and high commodity prices that are starting
to dent confidence.""
 With crude oil flows from Libya already crippled by a
standoff between rebels and the government, worries over
further supply disruptions rose as thousands of Yemeni
protesters took to the streets clamoring for President Ali
Abdullah Saleh to step down.
 ""The situation in the Middle East is still very bullish for
oil,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBEST Research in Chicago.
""The unrest spreading on top of the conflict in Libya is still
the market focus.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 9.62 points,
or 0.08 percent, to 12,026.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index

 Europe's main equity benchmark <.FTEU3> closed 0.06 percent
lower after hitting a one-week high on Monday.
 Tokyo's Nikkei average <.N225> added 4.4 percent as traders

 The CBOE volatility index <.VIX> edged 2.4 percent lower to

 EURO RETREATS, CRUDE REVERSES LOSSES
 In currency markets the euro  dipped after hitting
$1.4249 versus the U.S. dollar, its highest level since
November, as it ran into what traders said were options-related
barriers.
 Still, expectations that the European Central Bank will
hike interest rates next month could limit any downside for the
common currency.
 ""This, to me, is just a technical pullback,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey.
 The dollar also had hit a a 15-month low against other
major currencies <.DXY> but the index was trading near break
even.
 Gold was little changed as interest-rate hike expectations
kept the market calm, but air strikes on Libya and escalating
political unrest in the Middle East underpinned safe-haven
demand.
 U.S. oil prices  rose 1.6 percent to $104.53 per
barrel while Brent  added 0.8 percent at $115.91.
 Copper rose as worries about Japan's nuclear crisis eased
and boosted risk appetite, and supported by the weaker dollar,
but poor Chinese import data weighed on demand prospects.
 Chinese data released on Monday showed lower-than-expected
commodities imports for February.
 China's rare earth metal export prices in February,
however, were up almost ninefold from a year before, according
to Reuters calculations based on Chinese data [ID:nTOE72L01E].
 Shares in U.S. miner Molycorp , one of the few
companies outside China that is well-placed to capitalize on
the constriction in supply, jumped more than 14 percent.
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed in low volume as
investors looked for further progress in Japan and the Middle
East. Benchmark 10-year notes  were last unchanged

 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. crude prices jumped on
Tuesday as unrest in Yemen raised concerns about a further

 The U.S. dollar was unchanged near 15-month lows versus a

(Adds quotes and background)
 BERLIN, March 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
is pressing for further negotiations on an agreement struck by
euro zone finance ministers on the structure of the euro zone's
new bailout system, government sources said on Tuesday.
 Merkel believes the direction of the agreement on the
European Stability Mechanism -- the bailout scheme for members
of the euro zone coming into effect from 2013 -- is right but
details on capital injections should be changed.
 ""It's in the right direction but the path will have still
have to be altered,"" one source quoted Merkel as saying.
 Berlin wants to discuss both the timing and size of the
capital injections into the ESM, the sources said, without
giving further details.
 Earlier on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told
members of parliament from the ruling coalition that details of
the ESM agreed by European Union finance ministers earlier this
week in Brussels would not be the final word on the matter ahead
of a summit expected to finalise details at the end of the week.
 Finance ministers had agreed the ESM, which will replace the
existing European Financial Stability Facility, would have an
effective lending capital of 500 billion euros and a subscribed
capital structure of 700 billion euros to ensure its triple-A
credit rating.
 This total capital would consist of 80 billion euros in
paid-in capital and 620 billion in callable capital and
guarantees granted by euro zone member states.
 Their agreement proposed half of the paid-in capital should
be put up by July 2013 and the remaining 40 billion euros over
the following three years.

 * India could have 1.5 million tonnes more to export-trade
 * Focus will shift to Indian sugar stock levels
 
 By David Brough and Mayank Bhardwaj
 LONDON/NEW DELHI, March 22 (Reuters) - A decision by India
to approve 500,000 tonnes of unrestricted sugar exports, which
triggered a fall in futures prices on Tuesday, will set the
stage for further exports and relieve global supply tensions.
 India, the world's number 2 sugar producer after Brazil,
said on Tuesday it would allow 500,000 tonnes of sugar exports,
the first unrestricted overseas sales of the sweetener in three
years.
 Sugar futures fell from below 30-year highs, dealers said,
as the market had widely anticipated approval of just 200,000
tonnes of so-called ""Open General Licence"", or unrestricted,
exports.
 Analysts said India would probably approve more exports in
coming months, helping to ease bottlenecks around the world.
 ""We could well see exports after these 500,000 tonnes,"" a
senior analyst with a Western trade house said.
 But how much more India exports will depend on the size of
its harvest in 2010/11, which remains unclear.
 ""People were buying the market on expectations that they
weren't going to release as much (as 500,000 tonnes),"" one
senior London sugar broker said.
 ""I think you will see at least 1.5 million tonnes of OGL
exports this year. The government is waiting for confirmation of
the size of the crop, then they will get a move on,"" the London
broker added.
 The global sugar market, underpinned by tight supplies and
low stocks, had been on tenterhooks for months awaiting a
decision on Indian OGL sugar exports.
 India is a barometer for the sugar market. In some years it
is a big supplier after a good harvest, and in other years it is
a major importer if the domestic crop is poor.
 Analysts currently expect Indian output in 2010/11 to be
around 24-25 million tonnes and domestic consumption at around
22.5 million tonnes, lower than initially expected due to high
prices.
 The estimated 2 million tonnes of excess sugar output over
consumption in India could pave the way for some 1.5 million
tonnes of additional exports, as long as India does not move to
build up stocks.
 For now domestic stocks in India are ample as the harvest
winds up, but a key question will be whether stocks will be
adequate before the start of the next harvest.
 The approval of higher-than-expected exports on Tuesday is
likely to push depressed Indian domestic sugar prices higher as
availability on the national market will tighten.
 ""This move will improve sentiment about domestic prices in
the short run, and prices may rise by 100-150 rupees ($2.22) per
tonne, while global white sugar prices may ease by $5-10 per
tonne,"" said Mukesh Kuvadia, secretary of the Bombay Sugar
Merchants' Association.
 London May white sugar futures extended losses after the
export announcement to reach as low as $684 per tonne, before
closing at $700.40 per tonne, down $5.90.
 ICE May raw sugar was down 0.22 cent or 0.8 percent to 27.26
cents a lb at 1754 GMT.
 
 CROP SIZE
 The amount of future unrestricted Indian sugar exports and
the evolution of Indian domestic prices will hinge on the
progress of the remainder of the cane crush, which will wrap up
next month.
 Analysts said the delay in approval of Indian OGL sugar
exports had deprived Indian millers of the opportunity to lock
in sales at high prices. The market had touched a 30-year peak
of 36.08 cents a lb on Feb. 2.
 ""This move will help stabilise domestic prices and help
mills to pay cane growers' dues,"" said Vinay Kumar, managing
director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar
Factories, a producers' body of 250 mills.
 As a consequence of lower local prices, Indian mills'
outstanding payments to cane growers rose to 40 billion rupees
($886 million) up to Dec. 31.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Markets took a breather on
Tuesday following days of volatility as uncertainty over
fighting in Libya and Japan's earthquake aftermath kept both
stocks and U.S. government debt in a narrow range.
 Oil prices edged higher, with Brent briefly above $116 a
barrel after an earlier drop as unrest in Yemen raised concerns
about a further threat to supply.
 With little economic data to focus on, investors fretted
over world events such as nuclear reactor damage in Japan and
political instability in the Middle East and North Africa that
has kept oil prices volatile.
 The MSCI global stocks index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.3
percent, boosted by an overnight rise in Japanese stocks.
European and U.S. equity benchmarks fell slightly.
 Tokyo's Nikkei average <.N225> added 4.4 percent as traders
returned from a national holiday. Reports of progress in
containing radiation leaks at an earthquake-hit nuclear power
plant encouraged traders to buy domestic shares after last
week's losses of more than 10 percent.
 U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures  were trading
lower after three days of hefty gains.
 ""There's a relative calmness in markets as investors plot
their next moves, even though we're flying through fog with all
the issues that remain uncertain,"" said Jeffrey Davis, chief
investment officer at Lee Munder Capital Group in Boston.
 Trading volumes remained subdued in Wall Street.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> shed 9.58 points,

 EURO RETREATS, CRUDE REVERSES LOSSES
 In currency markets the euro  dipped after hitting
$1.4249 against the U.S. dollar, its highest level since
November, as it ran into what traders said were options-related
barriers.
 Still, expectations that the European Central Bank will
hike interest rates next month could limit any downside for the
common currency.
 ""This, to me, is just a technical pullback,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey.
 The dollar also had hit a a 15-month low against other
major currencies <.DXY> but later ticked up.
 Reversing earlier losses, U.S. crude  rose more than
1 percent to near $104 per barrel while Brent  edged
above $115 as unrest in Yemen threatened to further crimp
energy exports from the Gulf region.
 ""The situation in the Middle East is still very bullish for
oil,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBEST Research in Chicago.
""The unrest spreading (there) on top of the conflict in Libya
is still the market focus.""
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed in low volume as
investors looked for further progress in Japan and the Middle
East. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were
last down 4/32 in price to yield 3.34 percent.
 China's rare earth metal export prices were up almost
ninefold from a year before in February according to Reuters
calculations based on data from China's Customs office. For
details, see [ID:nTOE72L01E]
 The hike in export values has coincided with a collapse in
volumes coming out of China, the source of almost all the
world's rare earth supplies. The country has cut export quotas
and raised tariffs on exports, infuriating trading partners.
 Shares in U.S. miner Molycorp , one of the few
companies outside China that are well-placed to capitalize on
the constriction in supply, jumped more than 10 percent.

(Updates prices, adds comment, details)
 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - The euro eased back after
hitting a 4-1/2-month high against the dollar on Tuesday but
expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month could
limit any downside for the single currency.
 Sterling climbed to a fresh 14-month high against the
dollar also on expectations of an interest rate hike in coming
months after stronger-than-expected UK inflation data.
 The yen traded in a tight range, hovering around 81 per
dollar. In the near term, analysts said the 80 area could serve
as a floor as markets were wary of further intervention by the
Group of Seven nations to counter yen strength after Japan's
earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis. For details,
see [ID:nL3E7EL23A]
 The euro climbed as high as $1.4249  on trading
platform EBS, but gave up gains after running into
options-related barriers at about $1.4250. Further resistance
is seen around $1.4280, the November high.
 With the European Central Bank widely expected to raise
interest rates next month, traders said the euro may make
another run at those levels. The currency also found support
after euro zone officials agreed Monday on the setup of a
permanent euro zone bailout fund.
 ""We continue to expect euro to test up to the November high
of 1.4282 as we believe that recent developments have all been
negative for the U.S. dollar and positive for the euro,"" said
Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 The euro  last traded at 1.4210, down 0.2 percent
on the day. Technical analysts at Citigroup said they expect a
test of the $1.48-$1.51 area in the near term. The euro hit
around $1.5144 back in November 2009.
 German two-year bond yields have risen about 30 basis
points over the past week to 1.75 percent, widening the gap
over U.S. Treasury yields to about 110 basis points.
 The euro zone's permanent bailout fund, the European
Stability Mechanism, will be backed by paid-in and callable
capital and offer loans more cheaply than the temporary
facility does now, a euro zone source said. The comprehensive
package is to be approved by EU leaders on March 24-25.
 YEN SUBDUED
 The Group of Seven countries may have sold a total of
around 530 billion yen ($6.5 billion) last Friday as they
intervened in forex markets to weaken the Japanese currency,
data from the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday. [ID:nL3E7EM1IH]
 The amount is far smaller than market talk indicating they
could have sold around 2 trillion yen, though some analysts
said the figure was not a surprise.
 ""Our interpretation is that the signaling effect from
'coordinated intervention' did most of the job for the BoJ in
the short-run. Nevertheless, we judge that the BoJ is likely to
be ready for more persistent operations, should they be
needed,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at
Nomura in New York.
 Ihab Salib, senior portfolio manager and head of
international fixed-income at Federated Investors in
Pittsburgh, said in the medium term, authorities may try to
drive the dollar/yen to levels around 85 and 86.
 ""I don't have a high degree of comfort that they'll be able
to change the longer-term trend of a stronger yen. But in the
short to medium term, I think they will succeed,"" Salib said.
 Federated Investors manages about $350 billion in assets.
Salib oversees more than $3 billion.
 Japan again warned it would act to keep the yen in check,
but traders saw no action in the FX market on Tuesday from
Japanese or other G7 authorities. That resolve could be tested
if dollar/yen looks like it will break back below 80 yen.
 The dollar last traded at 80.94 yen , down 0.1
percent on the day but still near the middle of the day's
narrow range of 80.85-81.29 yen on EBS.
 Sterling added 0.4 percent at $1.6369  after
British inflation last month surged to a 28-month high of 4.4
percent, reviving speculation the Bank of England will not wait
much longer to raise interest rates. [ID:nLDE72L0TT]

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2011 01:29PM ET</span>",Cocoa exporters say Ivorian export embargo holding," * Cocoa sector sources deny change in policy
 * Levies would throw lifeline to Gbagbo if paid
 
 ABIDJAN/LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Cocoa exporters
dismissed on Tuesday a media report that some were preparing to
resume payment of export taxes to Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo,
saying a de facto embargo on shipments was holding.
 Gbagbo has refused to step down after a November election,
which most of the world says he lost. Alassane Ouattara, the
internationally recognised winner, has called for a freeze in
cocoa exports to deprive the Gbagbo camp of funds.
 However, the Financial Times reported that some exporters
were preparing to comply with a demand by Gbagbo that they pay
taxes on stocks of cocoa held in-country by the end of the month
for fear that it could be confiscated.
 Exporters and other trade sources denied that was the case.
 ""I would say there's no change in the exporters' stance and
that exporters do not wish to run the risk of EU sanctions,"" a
cocoa trade source in London said of European Union measures
that forbid financial transactions with pro-Gbagbo entities.
 A European source said some in the sector were making plans
for ""every contingency in an unpredictable situation"", but
stressed that an industry pact not to export was holding.
 ""Nothing has been shipped or is being prepared for shipment.
""Gbagbo can say he owns the cocoa, but I don't think he is going
to be able to take control of it,"" the source said.
 A spokesman for Swiss-based cocoa and chocolate giant Barry
Callebaut noted it had suspended cocoa bean and product exports
from Ivory Coast, adding: ""The situation has not changed, no.""
 Noble Group, the Kong Kong-based commodities group whose
chief executive was quoted by the FT as saying it would pay the
taxes if Gbagbo was still in control by March 31, declined to
comment. The FT article said the group later clarified that its
actions would be guided by legal advice.
 
 BUMPER CROP HELD IN STORAGE
 In a cruel irony for a country that some analysts say is now
in the midst of an all-out civil war, Ivory Coast is having a
bumper cocoa season. Arrivals to ports were estimated at over 1
million tonnes by the end of last week, over 100,000 tonnes up
on the same point of last year.
 Yet the Ouattara call, the EU sanctions and the collapse of
the local banking system have meant over 450,000 tonnes of
stocks are languishing in storage, and concerns about a
deterioration in quality are growing by the day.
 With some 360,000 tonnes due for export by the end of the
month, incurring an export tax (DUS, ""droit unique de sortie"")
of 17 percent, levies would total close to $200 million at
current market prices of around $3,200 a tonne.
 Such a windfall would give Gbagbo's government ample funding
to pay the monthly salaries of army and civil servants,
estimated at around $160 million.
 Worsening violence has already claimed over 400 lives and
prompted nearly half a million Ivorians to flee their homes. 
 Northern-based rebels from the 2002-2003 civil war have
declared their support for Ouattara and have taken several towns
in the west from Gbagbo forces.

 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - The euro retreated after

 (Adds details, graphic, quotes, price)
 By Nigam Prusty and Mayank Bhardwaj
 NEW DELHI, March 22 (Reuters) - India said on Tuesday it
would allow 500,000 tonnes of sugar exports, which was the first
unrestricted overseas sales of the sweetener in three years and
helped global prices ease.
 Shipments from India, the world's top consumer and the
biggest producer behind Brazil, will start in mid-April,
government sources said.
 At 1538 GMT, New York sugar futures were down 0.8 cent, or
3.1 percent, at 26.64 cents a pound, below last month's 30-year
high of 36.08 cents. London May white sugar was down $16.80 or
2.1 percent at $691 per tonne.
 India spent months deliberating on the exports, which amount
to a tiny part of its total output of about 25 million tonnes
this year but a political watershed after drought forced it to
import sugar in 2009/10.
 After a meeting of a panel of ministers, Rural Development
Minister Vilas Rao Deshmukh told reporters the government had
allowed the exports of half a million tonnes of sugar.
 Exports of sugar, subsidised by the state and a major source
of energy for the country's half a billion poor, have trickled
out in special deals so far, but these sales would be under Open
General Licence (OGL), with only a volume limit restriction.
 ""The news that India has allowed 500,000 tonnes of sugar
exports will be viewed as bearish. Prices will drop slightly, at
least in the short term,"" said Praful Vithalani, who owns Indian
brokerage Jagjivan Keshavaji.
 In addition to 500,000 tonnes of exports under OGL, India
has also allowed overseas shipments of 10,000 tonnes to the
European Union and 8,424 tonnes to the United States, government
sources said.
 These additional exports are an annual feature under World
Trade Organisation rules.
 The ministerial panel also extended stocks limit on sugar
beyond March by six months.

 LOWER EXPORT REALISATION
 Given the government's dithering for almost three months
amid high domestic food prices, industry sources had said on
Monday that only about 200,000 tonnes of exports would be
allowed.
 Farm Minister Sharad Pawar had permitted 500,000 tonnes of
exports in December, but the government later referred the issue
to a panel of ministers after a spike in food prices.
 The full export permission comes as food prices in India
eased from a year high seen in end-December.
 Analysts said the delay in allowing OGL exports had deprived
Indian sugar mills of higher export realisation due to a drop in
global prices.
 Global sugar prices rose last month to a 30-year high on
supply worries form Australia but then eased on improved output
prospects in major producing countries including Brazil, India
and Thailand.
 ""Allowing exports will help domestic prices stabilise and
mills to pay cane growers dues,"" said Vinay Kumar, managing
director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar
Factories, a producers' body of 250 mills.
 Domestic sugar prices have fallen by roughly a third in the
past year, making it difficult for mills to pay cane growers.
With exports now allowed, the mills are expected to be able to
clear arrears of about $886 million.
 It was not immediately clear where the bulk of the exports
could go, but import demand has been strong from countries in
the Middle East.
 Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami have damaged two
sugar refineries, but traders and industry officials said they
did not expect any drop in sugar exports to Japan.
 Traders had rather expected Japan to import more sugar this
year to offset falls in domestic production in Hokkaido, which
was hit by excessive rainfall late last year.

 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Markets took a breather on
Tuesday after days of volatility, as uncertainty over the
fighting in Libya kept both stocks and U.S. government debt in
a narrow range
 Oil prices edged higher, with Brent trading above $115
after an earlier drop as unrest in Yemen raised concerns about
a further threat to supply from the Gulf region.
 The euro retreated from a 4-1/2-month high against the
dollar but expectations that the European Central Bank will

currency.
 Economic data has taken a back seat to world events as
investors fretted over the extent of nuclear reactor damage in

 EURO RETREATS, GOLD UP
 In currency markets the euro  dipped after hitting
$1.4249 versus the U.S. dollar, its highest level since
November, as it ran into what traders said were options-related
barriers.
 The dollar also had hit a a 15-month low against other
major currencies <.DXY>but later ticked up.
 Gold  was on track for a fifth day of gains, fed by
investor demand for safe-haven assets as traders eyed Libya and
unrest in the Middle East.
 In addition to turmoil in the Middle East, oil prices were
boosted by the weakened dollar. U.S. crude  rose nearly 1
percent above $103 per barrel.
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed in low volume as
investors looked for further progress in Japan and the Middle
East. Benchmark 10-year notes  were last down 4/32
in price to yield 3.34 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - The euro eased after hitting
a 4-1/2-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, but
expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month could
limit any downside for the currency.
 The euro climbed as high as $1.4249 on trading platform
EBS, but gave up gains after running into options-related
barriers at about $1.4250. Further resistance is seen about
$1.4280, the November high.
 With the European Central Bank widely expected to raise
interest rates next month, traders said the euro may make
another run at those levels.
 ""This, to me, is just a technical pullback,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey.
 The euro last traded at 1.4201, down 0.2 percent on the
day. Technical analysts at Citigroup said they expect a test of
the $1.48-$1.51 area in the near term. The euro hit $1.5144
back in November 2009.
 Comments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet and other
ECB policymakers, who reiterated they were ready to act quickly
to guard against inflation, have lifted in the euro in recent
sessions.
 German two-year bond yields have risen about 30 basis
points over the past week to 1.75 percent, widening the gap
over U.S. Treasury yields to about 110 basis points.
 ""Euro/dollar is supported after Trichet continued to signal
a rate hike in April and by developments in yields,"" said Mic
Ingenuus, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""A test of the $1.4283 level is extremely likely in the
next couple of days, if not today.""
 The yen traded in a tight range, hovering around 81 per
dollar. In the near term, analysts said the 80 to 80.85 area
could serve as a floor as markets remained on alert for further
intervention by the Group of Seven nations to counter yen
strength.
 The Group of Seven countries may have sold a total of
around 530 billion yen ($6.5 billion) last Friday as they
intervened in forex markets to weaken the currency, data from
the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday.
 The amount is far smaller than market talk indicating they
could have sold around 2 trillion yen, though some analysts
said the figure was not a surprise.
 Japan again warned it would act to keep the yen in check,
but traders saw no action in the FX market on Tuesday from
Japanese or other G7 authorities. That resolve could be tested
if dollar/yen looks like it will break back below 80 yen.
 The dollar last traded at 81.00 yen, down marginally on the
day but in the middle of the day's narrow range of 80.80-81.30
yen.
 Yen volatility has eased significantly since late last
week, and some analysts said calmer markets in the coming weeks
would decrease the need for Tokyo to smooth any appreciation in
the Japanese currency, even if the dollar creeps below 80 yen.
 Sterling added 0.4 percent at $1.6381, having earlier risen
to $1.6403, the highest since January 2010. Euro/sterling was
down 0.5 percent at 86.70 pence.
 British inflation last month surged to a 28-month high of
4.4 percent, reviving speculation the Bank of England will not
wait much longer to raise interest rates.
 The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value
against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.2 percent to
75.249, the lowest since early December 2009. The index was
last at 75.508, up slightly on the day.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a
15-month low against other major currencies on Tuesday and
could extend losses as a resumption in risk appetite spurred
demand for currencies that offer higher returns.
 Expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month
lifted the euro to a 4-1/2-month high against the dollar
earlier, but gains were capped by a reported options barrier at
$1.4250 and a sell-off in euro/sterling following a jump in UK
inflation data.
 The yen traded in a tight range, hovering around 81 per
dollar. In the near term, analysts said the 80 to 80.85 area
could serve as a floor as markets remained on alert for further
intervention by the Group of Seven nations to counter yen
strength.
 Global financial markets stabilized after G7 launched
coordinated yen-weakening intervention last week and euro zone
officials agreed Monday on the setup of the European Stability
Mechanism, or a permanent euro zone bailout fund.
 ""Generally global policymakers and authorities are really
opening the door to taking on more risk,"" said Camilla Sutton,
senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value
against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.2 percent to
75.249 <.DXY>, the lowest since early December 2009.
 Sterling added 0.4 percent at $1.6381 , having
earlier risen to $1.6403, the highest since January 2010.
Euro/sterling was down 0.5 percent at 86.70 pence. 
 British inflation last month surged to a 28-month high of
4.4 percent, reviving speculation the Bank of England will not
wait much longer to raise interest rates. For details, see
[ID:nLDE72L0TT]
 Money markets are now fully pricing in a quarter-point rate
hike from the Bank of England in July, versus August before the
data.
 ""In general, the risk is for tighter monetary policy from
the BoE than is currently priced in by the market, and looser
monetary policy from the ECB (European Central Bank) than is
currently priced in by the market,"" said Paul Robinson, chief
sterling strategist at Barclays Capital.
 YEN SUBDUED
 The euro remained well supported by comments from ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet and other ECB policymakers, who
reiterated they were ready to act quickly to guard against
inflation. Most economists expect a rate hike next month.
 German two-year bond yields have risen about 30 basis
points over the past week to 1.75 percent, widening the gap
over U.S. Treasury yields to about 110 basis points.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4249  on trading
platform EBS, before retreating to 1.4197, down 0.2 percent.
 ""Euro/dollar is supported after Trichet continued to signal
a rate hike in April and by developments in yields,"" said Mic
Ingenuus, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""A test of the $1.4283 level is extremely likely in the
next couple of days, if not today.""
 The euro also drew support from a relatively strong Spanish
T-bill auction, where demand rose and the yield fell compared
with the last sale.
 Japan again warned it would act to keep the yen in check,
but traders saw no action in the FX market on Tuesday from
Japanese or other G7 authorities following last Friday's joint
intervention. That resolve could be tested if dollar/yen looks
like it will break back below 80 yen. [ID:nL3E7EM02L]
 The dollar last traded at 80.95 yen , down
marginally on the day but in the middle of the day's narrow
range of 80.80-81.30 yen.

 * Says recovery in Europe important for Swiss prospects

(Recasts with added comments, background)
 By Laura MacInnis
 GENEVA, March 22 (Reuters) - Demand for Switzerland's
exports remains ""remarkably resilient"" but uncertainties
including risks of protectionism cast a shadow on the global
economy, the head of the Swiss National Bank said on Tuesday.
 SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said rising oil prices in
the midst of conflict in Libya and concerns about Japan's
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear troubles could cloud the
economic outlook, even for the wealthy Alpine country where
unemployment is 3.4 percent.
 ""Uncertainty is elevated in every respect,"" he told a news
briefing in Geneva.
 While praising efforts by European Union finance ministers
to address the euro zone's debt problems, Hildebrand said there
remained worries for Switzerland, which sells most of its goods
to the EU bloc.
 ""The European debt problem in a number of peripheral
countries in the EU continues to cast a shadow of uncertainty
and risk on the Swiss economy,"" he said.
 ""Switzerland does well, globally speaking, when Europe is
doing well,"" he said. ""It is in Switzerland's interest to see
Europe re-find the path to stability.""
 Hildebrand also called on other countries to avoid trying to
shield their economies in response to economic worries.
 ""It remains one of the biggest challenges to keep resisting
all temptations of protectionism, including in foreign
exchange,"" he said.
 Last week, the SNB left its interest rate target unchanged
at an ultra-low level -- just 0.25 percent for the 3-month franc
LIBOR -- saying price stability was assured for the short term.
 It also raised its 2011 growth outlook to around 2.0 percent
from 1.5 percent.
 But Hildebrand warned that a strong Swiss franc alongside
near-zero interest rates could eventually cause distortions in
Switzerland's construction, housing and other sectors, and said
it was important to watch carefully for risks.
 ""While we can be satisfied with the performance of the Swiss
economy, the way it has emerged out of this historic crisis, I
think complacency would be the wrong attitude,"" he said. ""We
continue to face very significant challenges.""

 NEW YORK/LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - A jump in Japanese
shares buoyed global equities on Tuesday while the U.S. dollar
tumbled to 15-month lows against the index of major currencies
and was expected to weaken further.
 The benchmark Nikkei average <.N225> jumped 4.4 percent as
traders in Tokyo returned from a national holiday to recoup

the natural disasters and nuclear crisis have kept investors on

 US DOLLAR TUMBLES
 In currency markets the euro  hit $1.4249 versus the

 * PM Socrates has threatened to resign over measures

(Updates with deal on labour market, bond trader)
 By Shrikesh Laxmidas and Daniel Alvarenga
 LISBON, March 22 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament will vote
on the government's latest austerity measures on Wednesday,
setting the stage for a potential collapse of the minority
Socialist administration a day before a European summit.
Prime Minister Jose Socrates has threatened to resign if the
opposition fails to approve the measures. The main opposition
Social Democrats (PSD) are refusing to back them and have begun
to talk about snap elections, complicating the country's efforts
to avoid following Greece and Ireland in taking a bailout.
 ""Tomorrow the resolution on the measures will be voted,""
lawmaker Heloisa Apolonia of the Green Party said after a
meeting of parliamentary leaders on Tuesday. ""Tomorrow the
plenary will give answers to the country.""
 The government had hoped to obtain support for its plan
before a European Union summit gathers on Thursday to approve a
beefed-up euro zone rescue fund.
 Francisco Assis, parliament bench leader for the Socialists,
said there was still time for a compromise, while failure to
pass the measures would throw the country ""into an abyss"".
 Socrates, who announced a deal on Tuesday with employers and
some unions to cut redundancy pay in an effort to boost
competitiveness, said: ""Our country needs agreements, it needs
understanding and it needs dialogue."" He did not answer
journalists' questions about Wednesday's vote.
 The latest, disputed measures include further spending
cuts to ensure the government can cut the public deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) after beating last
year's goal of 7.3 percent.
 Some analysts have said that markets have begun to price in
a change of government and see a bailout as a near certainty.
 ""It is inevitable that the Portuguese people have the final
say,"" PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho said late on Monday,
suggesting a broad coalition after elections to solve the
country's problems.
 Still, economic policy may not change much as the opposition
is also broadly committed to the austerity path.
 Portugal's benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to 7.69 percent
from Monday's 7.53 percent, taking the premium investors demand
over German Bunds to 443 basis points from 430 bps.
 ""The idea and concept that the austerity may be thrown out
and the government may fall is undoubtedly not what bond-holders
want to hear,"" said Peter Chatwell, debt strategist at Credit
Agricole in London.
 Portugal's borrowing costs have soared during the year-long
sovereign debt crisis. The 10-year bond yield hit euro lifetime
highs of over 7.8 percent earlier this month, which ministers
said was an unsustainable financing level.
 
 MESSY COLLAPSE?
 Socrates' repeated threat to resign means the two-term prime
minister's future now hangs on Wednesday's vote.
 He threatened to quit in similar circumstances last year but
the Social Democrats turned up to offer backing each time,
including over the 2011 budget. 
 This time the PSD decided they have had enough, hoping
instead that their lead in opinion polls will translate into
them taking power whenever a snap election is held.
 ""Basically, we now have only two hypotheses -- a controlled
fall of the government and an uncontrolled collapse, but with
the PSD openly saying it wants an election and the president
silent everything points to the second option,"" said political
analyst Viriato Soromenho Marques at the University of Lisbon.
 President Anibal Cavaco Silva is seen by some analysts as a
possible mediator in the crisis but has remained silent so far
after meeting Passos Coelho and Socrates last week. 
 If the government resigns it is up the president to set a
snap election and decide on a caretaker administration with
limited powers until a new government is formed. The
constitution stipulates that the country can hold a snap
election at the earliest 55 days after the president calls them.
 The Socialists have 97 seats in the 230-seat parliament and
all other parties have so far said they will vote against the
measures, which need 116 votes to be approved.
 Passos Coelho said his party did not rule out following
Greece and Ireland in requesting an international bailout if it
came to power, if such a request were inevitable for Portugal to
recover from its difficult economic situation.
 The government's latest economic plan shows it now shares
economists' expectations of a recession in 2011. The document
predicted a contraction of 0.9 percent in GDP this year compared
with the previous estimate of 0.2 percent growth.

 * Institutional reforms difficult as opposition marginalised
 * Banks, industry giants to become reform's victims 
 
 By Gleb Bryanski 
 MOSCOW, March 22 (Reuters) - The Russian economy should
brace for a stronger rouble and painful institutional reforms
after the 2011-12 election cycle as a weak currency can no
longer drive growth, a top government expert told Reuters.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has asked a panel of experts
to rework Russia's long-term economic strategy after the global
financial crisis put ambitious development goals out of reach.
 ""A weak exchange rate can no longer play a role as the
driver of economic growth, nor can it heal policy failures in
attracting investment,"" economist Vladimir Mau, who co-chairs
the panel, said in an interview.
 ""It was obvious 5-7 years ago that relatively high inflation
was better than rouble appreciation. That's changed,"" Mau said.
""A stronger rouble implies lower inflation and interest rates.""
 The panel is due to report before parliamentary elections in
December, ensuring that an economic platform will be in place
before the March 2012 presidential vote in which Putin or
incumbent Dmitry Medvedev may run.
 Mau said the panel had a mandate from both Putin and
Medvedev and the programme will not be tailored for a specific
candidate.
 Putin launched a dash for growth during his 2000-08
presidency, but the slump suffered by Russia during the global
recession exposed the economy's reliance on energy exports and
foreign capital. 
 Policymakers have since struggled to turn the economic
crisis into an opportunity to hold inflation in the mid-single
digits, and consumer price growth is now once again approaching
double digits.
 Mau argued that the policy of curbing the rouble's exchange
rate, practised throughout the 2000s, was a legacy of the 1998
economic crisis, when a sharp devaluation spurred recovery.
 Growth in imports and capital outflows despite weakness in
the rouble in late 2010 have shown that such a policy is no
longer working, Mau said, adding that Russia should let the
rouble float under a modified inflation targeting regime.
 
 BAD HEALTH
 Mau said net private capital outflow of $38.3 billion in
2010, which prompted some economists to question Russia's
standing in the BRIC group of major emerging economies, was
partly a result of corruption and institutional weakness.
 ""It is a sign of bad health. Some of it was the money pumped
into the economy as part of anti-crisis measures. Some stuck to
someone's hands,"" Mau said, pointing out that part of the money
was transferred from the regions in small amounts.
 ""Some of the outflow was medium-sized businesses hedging
their bets,"" he said, adding that corruption is becoming ""a
macroeconomic factor"" in Russia.
 Mau said institutional reforms stalled in the mid-2000s when
Putin was still president and when Russia faced an influx of
petrodollars with growth accompanied by a slide down
international ratings for corruption and the investment climate.
 ""By the mid-2000s it became clear that most economic
problems cannot be solved without a significant increase in the
efficiency of political and law enforcement institutions.
Everything possible had already been done,"" Mau said.
 Mau said political reforms were more difficult now and even
moves such as a return to elections for regional governors,
abolished by Putin in 2004, would not necessarily work since
Russia's political opposition is so marginalised.
 Mau said Russian society did not generate sufficient demand
for modernisation, which he defined as a drive to narrow the gap
in GDP per capita with developed countries, and it remained a
personal project of Putin and Medvedev. 
 ""Demand for reforms is coming from the President and Prime
Minister. Nobody else in Russia is fighting for it,"" Mau said.
 Mau said many of Russia's 1,000-plus banks as well as some
industrial dinosaurs would fall victim to a new round of reforms
that would happen after the election regardless of the outcome.
 ""We have successfully dealt with the immediate threats from
the crisis but the problems have not gone anywhere. The problem
of 1,200 banks is still there. The problem of industrial
monsters is still there.""

 * Other foreign currency sales already halted
 * Running out of reserves
 * Businessmen say unofficial exchange rate has emerged
(Adds c.bank confirmation, details, comments)
 By Andrei Makhovsky
 MINSK, March 22 (Reuters) - Belarus's central bank has
halted foreign currency sales to local banks in a bid to save
dwindling reserves, the bank said on Tuesday.
 The former Soviet republic is running out of foreign
currency reserves due to a large trade deficit, earlier
overspending by the government and high demand for cash dollars
and euros among the population.
 The central bank this month halted most foreign currency
sales to banks by requiring them to be booked 30 days in
advance. It did, however, continue sales of foreign currency in
cash for foreign exchange points.
 But in a letter to local banks seen by Reuters on Tuesday it
said an earlier document allowing for cash foreign currency
sales was now cancelled. The central bank later confirmed the
letter was valid.
 ""Banks now have to rely on their own long positions in
foreign currency,"" said a Belarussian banker, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ""(But) the reality is that banks have no
long positions in foreign currency.""
 The central bank's foreign currency reserves shrank 20
percent in the first two months of this year to $4 billion and
now cover just a few weeks of imports.
 
 ""BLACK MARKET"" RATE EMERGES
 Belarus has asked Russia and other former Soviet states for
$3 billion in loans which officials say would help the country
avoid the devaluation of the rouble but some analysts say it is
still very likely.
 Businessmen in Belarus say a ""black market"" exchange rate is
emerging as banks offer dollars to them at a rate much higher
than the official one.
 ""There have been cases when banks offered dollars at
3,700-3,800 roubles,"" said Viktor Margelov, a co-chairman of the
Republican Confederation of Entrepreneurship, a business
lobbying group.
 The official exchange rate is 3,020 roubles per dollar. Some
businessmen, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they
were also factoring a weaker rouble into their pricing policies
and plans.
 ""Nobody wants to live on a gunpowder keg,"" said Margelov. ""A
planned devaluation would have been better than uncertainty.""

 (Adds Hildebrand comment on exports)
 ZURICH, March 22 (Reuters) - Swiss exports rose 4.2 percent
on the month in February as consumers abroad snapped up the
country's watches and machinery, underlining Swiss exporters'
ability to weather a strong franc.
 Monthly growth in exports compared with a 4.9 percent
seasonally adjusted increase in January. Exports in February
rose 16 percent in real terms from a year earlier, slowing only
slightly from a revised 16.7 percent rise in January, and rose
10.4 percent in nominal terms to 16.5 billion Swiss francs
($18.2 billion).
 ""The exports were remarkably resilient in light of the
appreciation of the Swiss franc,"" Swiss National Bank Chairman
Philipp Hildebrand told journalists in Geneva.
 Demand for watches surged 17.8 percent in nominal terms to
1.4 billion francs in February, making it the best month ever
for the industry, as shoppers in China splurged on Swiss
timepieces.
 ""There is so far no sign to suggest that the economy is
losing momentum as both imports and exports rose further,""
Informa Global Markets analyst Nikola Stephen said.
 ""For the SNB, this means that it will have to remain on
alert as the economy maintains momentum although the central
bank still has plenty of time before the next meeting to await
further data.""
 Overall, Switzerland ran a merchandise trade surplus of 2.5
billion francs in February.
 The SNB kept rates ultra-low last week despite an improving
economic outlook. The central bank said risks still lurked due
to Europe's debt crisis and the devastating events in Japan.
 The Swiss economy has emerged from the financial crisis in
relatively strong shape and the domestic conditions for a rate
hike are ripe thanks to a low jobless rate, booming real estate
market and upbeat consumer sentiment.
 But the central bank has so far shied away from tightening
to avoid an additional boost to the strong franc, which it has
called an ""extraordinary burden"" on Swiss exporters.
 Credit Suisse analyst Fabian Heller pointed out that export
prices had fallen again, indicating exporters' margins were
probably shrinking due to the strong franc, which hit record
highs against the euro and the dollar at the end of last year.

(Updates with decision to vote Wednesday, analyst)
 By Shrikesh Laxmidas and Daniel Alvarenga
 LISBON, March 22 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament will vote
on the government's latest austerity measures on Wednesday,
setting the stage for a potential collapse of the minority
Socialist administration a day before a European summit.
Prime Minister Jose Socrates has threatened to resign if the
opposition fails to approve the measures. The main opposition
Social Democrats (PSD) are refusing to back them and have begun
to talk about snap elections, complicating the country's drive
to avoid following Greece and Ireland in taking a bailout.
 ""Tomorrow the resolution on the measures will be voted,""
lawmaker Heloisa Apolonia of the Green Party said after a
meeting of parliamentary leaders on Tuesday. ""Tomorrow the
plenary will give answers to the country.""
 The government had hoped to obtain support for its plan
before a key European Union summit gathers on Thursday to
approve a beefed-up euro zone rescue fund.
 It says it remains open to talks on the measures, which
include further spending cuts to ensure it can reach a target of
cutting the public deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic
product after beating last year's goal of 7.3 percent.
 Some analysts have said that markets have begun to price in
a change of government.
 ""It is inevitable that the Portuguese people have the final
say,"" PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho said late on Monday, adding
that the country needed a broad coalition after elections to
solve its problems.
 Socialist bench leader Francisco Assis was expected to hold
a news conference later on Tuesday.
 With a bailout seen as pretty much inevitable and the
opposition also broadly committed to the austerity path, even
the ousting of the government may not elicit dramatic market
reaction.
 
 MESSY COLLAPSE?
 Because of Socrates' repeated threat to resign over the
austerity measures, the two-term prime minister's future now
hangs on Wednesday's vote. 
 He threatened to quit in similar circumstances last year but
the Social Democrats turned up to offer backing each time,
including over the 2011 budget. 
 This time the PSD decided they have had enough, hoping
instead that their lead in opinion polls will translate into
them taking power whenever a snap election is held.
 ""Basically, we now have only two hypotheses - a controlled
fall of the government and an uncontrolled collapse, but with
the PSD openly saying it wants an election and the president
silent everything points to the second option,"" said political
analyst Viriato Soromenho Marques at the University of Lisbon.
 Ultimately, for the Portuguese facing lower salaries, higher
taxes and a recession, things may not change much as the Social
Democrats are likely to stay the austerity course.
 Passos Coelho said his party did not rule out following
Greece and Ireland in requesting an international bailout if it
came to power, if such a request were inevitable for Portugal to
recover from its difficult economic situation.
 The government on Monday presented its latest economic plan,
including broad economic outlines for the coming year and showed
that for the first time it now expects there to be a recession
in 2011 as most economists have forecast.
 The document predicted a contraction of 0.9 percent in gross
domestic product this year compared with the previous estimate
of 0.2 percent growth.
 Portugal's bond yields have soared during the year-long
sovereign debt crisis with the yield on its benchmark 10-year
bond hitting euro lifetime highs of around 7.8 percent earlier
this month. 
 The yield was at 7.6 percent on Tuesday and the spread to
safer German Bunds was unchanged at 432 basis points.

 * UK CPI jump to 4.4 percent pushes sterling higher 
 * Yen trading subdued, no intervention seen 
 
 By Jamie McGeever
 LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a 15-month
low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, with sterling
among the biggest gainers after a rise in UK inflation increased
the chances of a UK interest rate hike sooner rather than later.
 Relative interest rate expectations also lifted the euro to
its highest against the dollar this year, but a reported options
barrier at $1.4250 and a sharp sell-off in euro/sterling
following the UK inflation data capped its gains.
 Consumer prices in the UK last month rose by 4.4 percent, a
28-month high, and more than double the Bank of England's
mid-point target of 2 percent. Money markets are now fully
pricing in a quarter point rate hike from the Bank of England in
July, versus August before the data.
 The yen, meanwhile, was little changed on the day in a tight
range, around 81 per dollar. Traders were wary of further
intervention from the Group of Seven to counter yen strength,
but reported nothing so far. 
 The big mover in London trading, though, was sterling, one
day before the budget and the last BoE meeting minutes. 
 ""This makes it slightly more likely that they (BoE) will
increase rates in May, but only slightly,"" said Paul Robinson,
chief sterling strategist at Barclays Capital, referring to the
inflation jump.
 ""In general, the risk is for tighter monetary policy from
the BoE than is currently priced in by the market, and looser
monetary policy from the ECB (European Central Bank) than is
currently priced in by the market,"" he said.
 At 1115 GMT sterling was up 0.5 percent on the day at
$1.6380, having earlier risen to $1.64, the highest since
January 2010. 
 Euro/sterling was down a third of 1 percent at 86.90 pence,
and the euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.4240.
 The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against
a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.2 percent to 75.254,
the lowest since December 2009.
 
 YEN SUBDUED
 The euro remains well supported by comments from ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet and other ECB policymakers,
reiterating their stance that they are ready to act quickly to
guard against inflation. Most economists expect a rate hike next
month.
 German two-year bond yields have risen around 30 basis
points over the past week to 1.75 percent, widening the gap over
U.S. Treasury yields to around 110 basis points.
 ""Euro/dollar is supported after Trichet continued to signal
a rate hike in April and by developments in yields,"" said Mic
Ingenuus, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""A test of the $1.4283 level is extremely likely in the next
couple of days, if not today"".
 The euro also drew support from a relatively strong Spanish
T-bill auction, where demand rose and the yield fell compared
with the last sale.
Japan again warned that it would act to keep the yen in
check, but traders saw no action in the FX market on Tuesday
from Japanese or other G7 authorities following last Friday's
joint intervention. That resolve could be tested if dollar/yen
looks like breaking back below 80 yen.
 The dollar was last trading at 81.00 yen, down marginally on
the day but in the middle of the day's narrow range of
80.80-81.30 yen. 
 Yen volatility has eased significantly since late last week,
and some analysts said calmer markets in the coming weeks would
decrease the need for Tokyo to smooth any appreciation in the
Japanese currency, even if the dollar creeps below 80 yen.

 By Marc Jones
 FRANKFURT, March 22 (Reuters) - The euro zone's near-term
inflation outlook has not been changed by the disasters in Japan
and G7 members would intervene again in yen FX markets if Japan
decided it was necessary, a top ECB policymaker was quoted as
saying on Tuesday.
 ECB board member Juergen Stark, who heads the bank's
influential economics unit, said the earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear disasters in Japan had increased economic uncertainty in
recent weeks, as had increased tensions in the Middle East.
 Nevertheless, he bolstered the view that the ECB will follow
through with its plans to hike interest rates next month.
 ""For me, the situation in the euro area, with the ongoing
economic growth and ongoing threat to price stability, in the
short term has not changed,"" Stark said in an interview with
Japan's Nikkei newspaper carried out on Friday.
 ""However, the uncertainty has increased, in particular due
to the events in Japan and due to the geopolitical situation in
other regions.""
 Stark also said G7 members were willing to repeat last
week's intervention in yen currency markets if Japan decided it
was necessary.
 ""This (further intervention) is up to the Japanese
authorities to consider this possibility,"" he said. ""The G7
finance ministers and central banks expressed their readiness to
provide any needed cooperation.""
 Stark, one of the ECB's six-strong board, gave further hints
that he saw the need for the ECB to raise rates -- frozen at a
record low of 1 percent since May 2009 -- next month to prevent
a wage-price spiral.
 ""There is a risk of second-round effects. And it is the task
of a central bank to prevent these effects from materialising.""
 ""The monetary policy around the globe in advanced economies
and in emerging economies is very accommodative,"" he said. ""So
what is considered by the ECB's Governing Council is also a step
into (the) direction of normalising the monetary policy stance.""
 Stark added in the interview, a transcript of which was
provided by the ECB, that the bank would stop buying government
bonds as soon as possible.
 The ECB introduced the controversial tactic at the beginning
of the euro zone debt crisis last May. Last week it bought no
bonds for the third week in a row but it has so far failed to
convince euro zone leaders to allow the region's fiscal bailout
fund to take over the role.
 ""The Securities Market Programme (SMP) is a temporary
measure, but still in place in order to ensure the functioning
of the transmission mechanism for the monetary policy in some
regions of the euro area,"" Stark said.
 ""It is a temporary measure and it will be phased out as
quickly as possible.""
 Stark also touched on the ECB's money market support
measures, saying its ability to phase out the aid depended on
decisions made by governments this week on the euro zone's
future debt rules and bailout fund.
 ""Banks are less dependent to our operations and this is a
clear sign of normalisation in the interbank market. We have
phased out already many measures. Some measures are still
needed.""
 ""It will also depend on the measures taken by governments
and the decisions by the Heads of State or Government this
week,"" Stark said.

talk

analyst

(Adds detail, background)	
 TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven (G7)
countries may have sold a total of around 530 billion yen ($6.5
billion) on Friday as they intervened in forex markets to weaken
the currency, data from the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday.	
 The amount is far smaller than market talk that they could
have sold around 2 trillion yen, though some analysts said the
figure was not a surprise.	
 ""My impression is that the dollar rose smoothly in light
trading volume on Friday,"" said Osamu Takashima, chief FX
analyst at Citibank Japan. 
 "" In September, when Japan unilaterally intervened,
there was heavy dollar selling to counter intervention. Compared
to that, trading volume looked smaller this time."" 
 Any yen the BOJ and other central banks sold for
dollars would be paid into banks on Wednesday as currency trades
are settled two business days after transactions and the
country's markets were closed for a holiday on Monday.	
The BOJ's projection for Wednesday's money markets showed
there would be 830 billion yen in payments to banks from the
public sector. That is 530 billion yen more than the about 300
billion yen of payments from the government that money brokers
had been expecting ahead of intervention. 
Market players say the difference between their expectations
and the projection is likely to indicate how much yen G7 central
banks sold on Friday, although money broker estimates are
ballpark figures with a margin for error.	
 The G7 countries intervened jointly to stem the yen's
strength on Friday -- their first coordinated currency
intervention in more than a decade -- after the yen soared to a
record high of 76.25 yen per dollar .	
 The U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Canada
and European Central Bank, each separately confirmed they
intervened to keep the yen's value from climbing, though the
BOJ's intervention was thought to be by far the largest. 
 ""I don't think the market feels the commitment of
intervention is weak despite the amount coming in much smaller
than expected,"" said Junya Tanase, forex strategist at JPMorgan
Chase Bank in Tokyo.	
 ""I don't think the market will start selling (the
dollar) after seeing this result. The market is still concerned
about possible intervention.""	
 Many analysts think coordinated intervention is
more powerful than unilateral moves because it sends a strong
message that those who participate in intervention share a
common view on markets.	
 Juergen Stark, who heads the ECB's influential economics
unit, said on Tuesday that G7 members were willing to repeat
last week's intervention if Japan decided it was necessary.

 Friday's intervention marked the first time Japan had
intervened since Sept. 15, when it sold 2.12 trillion yen, a
record daily amount.	
 The Ministry of Finance will announce on March 31 how much
it spent on currency market intervention in March.

* Agriculture arm of Doha trade talks makes no progress
* EU's move to waive Pakistan tariff fails again
 
 By Andrew Callus
 GENEVA, March 22 (Reuters) - Lawmakers from around the world
doubt a meaningful global trade agreement will be struck this
year and fear the rapid growth of self-serving side deals could
kill it off completely.
 Their frustrations come as the latest push to improve a
draft global deal text by Easter drew a blank in agriculture
discussions, and as a months-old initiative by the European
Union to help flood-hit Pakistan hit the buffers.
 Delegates at the annual World Trade Organization (WTO)
parliamentary conference in Geneva lauded the concept of free
trade, saying the existing structure held back protectionism
during the 2008 financial crisis.
 But although these members of national parliaments mostly
lack direct influence on the talks themselves, those who would
bet against completion of the decade-old Doha round by the WTO's
end-2011 target were easy to find.
 ""I hope it happens, but realistically speaking I don't think
it will conclude this year,"" said Se Hwan Jang, an opposition
Democratic Party member of South Korea's national assembly.
 ""It's very hard for all 153 member countries to reach a
consensus .... (and) the proliferation of bilateral and regional
trade pacts will undermine the process.""
 Bilateral and regional agreements have boomed since the Doha
talks stalled in 2008. Governments have found themselves
jostling for position as the balance of trading power shifts to
high-growth countries like China and Brazil, and as
tariffs and other barriers to free trade grow into the void left
by the failing global talks.
 Multilateral trade deals are designed to benefit all
parties, but in bilateral and regional deals, weaker countries
tend to get a rougher deal, or simply get excluded, and the
proliferation of these pacts is seen as escalating
protectionism.
 ""If it all (Doha) takes so long we have little choice,"" said
a delegate from Costa Rica, which has bilateral pacts with the
United States, EU and China.
 South Korea and the EU say a bilateral deal they hope to
strike this year should be a building block for a global one,
not a hindrance to it, but a host of others are seen as
detrimental to the spirit of global trade.
 ""Do we have to choose? (between bilateral/regional deals and
a multilateral one). No. But there is a growing number of
shallow regional trade agreements that risk increasing
discrimination or diverting trade between regions,"" said Ditte
Juul-Joergensen, acting director of WTO Affairs at the European
Commission's Directorate-General for Trade.
 WTO director-general Pascal Lamy warned recently that the
pace of talks has been too slow to reach that year-end deadline.
 Negotiators battling to rescue the talks now want to produce
a working text by Easter -- a deadline now just a month away and
already put back from the end of March.
 But David Walker, chairman of the pivotal Doha agriculture
talks, told negotiators on March 18 their 10 days of talks had
ended without progress, according to delegates.
 Those discussions are due to restart in early April, and the
agriculture text is said to be in better shape than other parts
of the draft package. Nevertheless, the WTO is worried.
 ""Bluntly put, there's a need for urgent acceleration of work
at all levels,"" Yonov Frederick Agah, Nigeria's ambassador to
the WTO told the conference.
 Agah, recently appointed to chair the WTO's crucial
dispute-solving body, said work so far ""lacks the substantive
breakthroughs,"" needed at this stage.
 
 DISASTER MANAGEMENT
 Agah would not be drawn on whether turmoil in the Arab world
and the devastating earthquake in Japan will further slow the
Doha process in any direct way.
 But one delegate said the failure of the WTO to react
effectively to world events was part of its problem.
 This week the EU suffered its latest failure to push through
a tariff waiver to help Pakistan recover from last year's
devastating floods. In a plan that dates back to October, it
wants to suspend tariffs on goods covering about a quarter of
Pakistan exports to the EU.
 But according to a source in a March 21 meeting, the vote,
which has to be unanimous, was held up by countries that compete
with Pakistan.
 ""If the WTO cannot agree on a waiver for Pakistan or
countries affected by natural disasters, then I believe it has
little chance of progressing on Doha,"" said Robert Sturdy, a
European Member of Parliament from Britain who backed the plan.
 ""It destroys the respectability of the whole Doha process"".

 By Pratima Desai
 LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - World stocks put in solid gains
on Tuesday as concerns eased about the impact of Japan's triple
disaster on world growth prospects and traders in Tokyo returned
from a national holiday to recoup some of last week's losses.
 Buyers expecting the economy will also ride out continuing
unrest in the Middle East emerged to tap cheap valuations, while
the euro rose to its highest in four and a half months against
the dollar.
 The conflict in Libya, while unrest bubbles in other Arab
states, kept oil prices high and boosted gold, used as a hedge
against rising security concerns.
 But after a strong sell-off following Japan's earthquake and
tsunami, investors have begun to return to equity markets.
Reports of progress in containing radiation leaks at the
Fukushima plant helped Tokyo shares rally more than 4 percent.
 ""The global multispeed recovery remains on a steady path,
with most economies set to experience at- or near-potential
growth in 2011,"" Roubini Global Economics macroeconomic team
said in a note.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was
0.2 percent higher at 1,110.23 points at 1141 GMT after surging
1.8 percent in the previous session, buoyed by merger and
acquisition news in the telecom sector.
 ""If there is no escalation of violence in Libya and no
sudden twist in the Japan nuclear reactor situation, it looks
like we will recoup the losses since the Japan crisis,"" Angus
Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads said. 
 The MSCI global stocks index was up 0.6 percent.
 U.S. stocks were set to open little changed.
 
 GOLD AT NEW RECORD
 In currency markets the euro hit $1.4249, its highest since
November, boosted by expectations the European Central Bank will
raise interest rates next month, which prompted demand from
longer-term ""real money"" investors.
 ""Euro/dollar is supported after (ECB President Jean-Claude)
Trichet continued to signal a rate hike in April,"" said Mic
Ingenuus, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The latest batch of comments from policymakers on Monday
showed them sticking to a hard line on inflation as well as
language which has traditionally been used to signal a rise in
rates was imminent.
 The yen steadied as concerns about possible further
intervention by the Group of Seven major economies to undermine
it against the dollar and other currencies stopped traders from
trying to push the Japanese currency higher.
 ""We see the G7's decision to intervene as a game-changer for
(dollar/yen). Joint intervention may have a delayed impact, but
it tends to be associated with a change in direction,"" Standard
Chartered said in a note.
 Worries about the disruption of crude supply are expected to
underpin oil prices, even though some investors were taking
profits in anticipation of a slowdown in air strikes against
Libya.
 Brent crude for May earlier touched a $115.50 earlier --
less than $5 from a 2-1/2-year high near $120 hit last month. It
was last at $114.73. 
 ""It now seems likely that there will be a significant loss
of Libyan oil supplies for some time,"" said Ric Spooner, chief
market analyst at CMC Markets. ""This will reduce the buffer of
excess capacity and increase the oil market's vulnerability to
any new supply shocks which may emerge.""
 JPMorgan in a note said: ""A resolution to the Japanese
nuclear crisis would be bullish for crude prices near term as it
would shift the focus to Japan's reconstruction.""

 * Says China not sufficiently fair, transparent	

(Adds Chinese Commerce Ministry comments, byline)	
 By Koh Gui Qing	
 BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. firms are increasingly
vexed over growing Chinese red tape that prevents them from
expanding quickly in China's vast market, a survey by the
American Chamber of Commerce showed on Tuesday.	
 Road blocks faced by firms in getting business licenses have
multiplied to the extent that companies are now more worried
about bureaucratic hurdles than by nebulous laws and regulation
or corruption, AmCham's annual survey on China's business
climate showed.	
 ""The number-one challenge that our members listed this year
is bureaucracy,"" Ted Dean, AmCham's chairman in China, told
reporters at a briefing. ""Members are saying that licensing
procedures have become more difficult.""	
 The survey took pains to stress that U.S. firms want to stay
in China, but criticisms were also thinly veiled, making plain
the alternating love and hate that executives feel when it comes
to doing business in a tightly controlled environment in the
world's fastest-growing major economy.	
 ""As China enters the tenth year in the World Trade
Organisation, the goal of a fair and transparent regulatory
environment has not yet been achieved,"" Dean said.	
 Dean said U.S. firms believe they are discriminated against
when they apply for licenses as they face delays and a lack of
transparency, and at times are unable to get the licenses that
their Chinese peers have received.	
 Nearly 435 firms took part in the AmCham survey. A total of
31 percent of 338 respondents said bureaucratic processing was
their biggest challenge, compared with 23 percent last year. To
a question on what permit was most difficult to get, 42 percent
of 220 respondents said it was a new business license.	
 This is frustrating U.S. firms at a time they want to court
the Chinese consumer.	
 ""This is just the moment when companies are looking to
benefit from domestic demand in the market and looking to sell
into the domestic market,"" Dean said.	
 Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Yao Jian said,
however, that China was committed to treating foreign companies
well and to opening its market. 
 ""We will continue to further promote the opening up of
the domestic market,"" he told a regular news conference. ""We
will give equal treatment to foreign investors and Chinese
companies alike."" 
 FIRMS STILL EXPANDING	
 Though China has made significant progress in welcoming
foreign firms since joining the World Trade Organisation in
2001, companies want China to move even faster.	
 Occasional setbacks, as with Google Inc's
accusation on Monday that the Chinese government is foiling its
Gmail service, are also unhelpful. China's
Foreign Ministry on Tuesday dismissed Google's accusation as
""unacceptable."" 
 The AmCham survey outlined a laundry list of concerns that
foreign firms usually have when operating in China --
difficulties in hiring managers, unclear laws and regulations,
inconsistent interpretation of regulations as well as
infringement of intellectual property rights.	
 Preferential treatment that Chinese firms get when it comes
to bidding for contracts from China's government was also a
growing concern among foreign firms.	
 Forty percent of firms polled said they believe China's
policy of favouring ""indigenous innovation"" would soon start to
hurt their profits. But for now, almost 70 percent said they
have yet to feel an impact.	
 Still, firms are not slowing their China expansion plans.	
 Nearly 10 percent of 281 respondents said they plan to
expand their business by more than 50 percent this year, with 33
percent planning to grow operations by between one-tenth and
one-fifth.

(Changes source, adds details, background)
 MINSK, March 22 (Reuters) - Belarus's central bank has
halted foreign currency sales to local banks in a bid to save
dwindling reserves, according to a document seen by Reuters on
Tuesday.
 The former Soviet republic is running out of foreign
currency reserves due to a large trade deficit, earlier
overspending by the government and high demand for cash dollars
and euros among the population.
 The central bank this month halted most foreign currency
sales to banks by requiring them to be booked 30 days in
advance. It did, however, continue sales of foreign currency in
cash for foreign exchange points.
 But in a letter to local banks on Tuesday, it said an
earlier document allowing for cash foreign currency sales was
now cancelled.
 ""Banks now have to rely on their own long positions in
foreign currency,"" said a Belarussian banker, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ""(But) the reality is that banks have no
long positions in foreign currency.""
 The central bank did not confirm or deny the validity of the
document. Its foreign currency reserves shrank 20 percent in the
first two months of this year to $4 billion and now cover just a
few weeks of imports.
 Belarus has asked Russia and other former Soviet states for
$3 billion in loans which officials say would help the country
avoid devaluation but some analysts say it is still very likely.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2011 06:08AM ET</span>",G7 yen-selling intervention estimated at Y530 bln," TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven (G7)
countries may have sold a total of around 530 billion yen ($6.5
billion) on Friday as they intervened in forex markets to weaken
the currency, data from the Bank of Japan showed on Tuesday.	
 Any yen the BOJ and other central banks sold for dollars
would be paid into banks on Wednesday as currency trades are
settled two business days after transactions and the country's
markets were closed for a holiday on Monday.	
The BOJ's projection for Wednesday's money markets showed
there would be 830 yen in payments to banks from the public
sector. That is 530 billion yen more than the about 300 billion
yen of payments from the government that money brokers had been
expecting ahead of intervention. 
Market players say the difference between their expectations
and the projection is likely to indicate how much yen G7 central
banks sold on Friday, although money broker estimates are
ballpark figures with a margin for error.	
 The Group of Seven (G7) countries intervened jointly to stem
the yen's strength on Friday -- their first coordinated currency
intervention in more than a decade -- after the yen soared to a
record high of 76.25 yen per dollar .	
 The U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Canada
and European Central Bank, which represents all 17 countries
that use the euro, each separately confirmed they
intervened to keep the yen's value from climbing. 
 Still, the BOJ's intervention was thought to be by far the
largest. 
 It Also marked the first time Japan had intervened since
Sept. 15, when it sold 2.12 trillion yen, a record daily amount.	
 The Ministry of Finance will announce on March 31 how much
it spent on currency market intervention in March.

 * Call for WHO to become involved
 HAMBURG, March 22 (Reuters) - Ukraine's plans for greater
state control of grain exports could push foreign grain trading
houses out of the country, a German international trade
association said on Tuesday.
 A draft law in Ukraine proposes that traders and exporters
would have to buy grain from a Ukrainian state company instead
of directly from the country's farmers, which critics say would
effectively create a state cereals export monopoly.
 ""These rules, which reflect a state monopoly, would push
foreign trading companies, which have invested large sums in
building up export infrastructure, out of the Ukrainian market,""
said Eckhard Cordes, chairman of German east European
international trade association Ost-Ausschuss.
 Investments made by German grain trading companies are among
those threatened, Cordes said in a statement.
 The association said it has written to Ukrainian president
Viktor Yanukovich saying the plan could cause long-term damage
to Ukraine's reputation as a long-term and reliable trading
partner.
 The association also called on the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organisation (WTO) to become
involved, claiming the grain export plan did not conform with
WTO rules.
 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's had
said on March 11 it has sent a joint letter with the IMF and
World Bank to Ukraine's Prime Minister airing concerns that the
proposed state-controlled grain export monopoly could deter
future private sector investment in the country's agricultural
industry.

 By Jon Herskovitz	
 KESENNUMA, Japan, March 22 (Reuters) - Fuel shortages, icy
rain and power outages are hampering Japan's worst humanitarian
crisis since World War Two, but relief workers are reporting
some progress as mangled roads are reopened and new homes built.	
 The sheer numbers in the world's costliest natural disaster
-- estimated at $250 billion -- remain staggering. There are
about 21,000 dead or missing, 319,000 people evacuated, 2,131
makeshift shelters, 2.4 million people without access to water
and 221,000 households without power.	
 ""There is some improvement in terms of logistics and in
getting food and other supplies,"" said Francis Markus of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
delegation in Tokyo.	
 ""But it is still very difficult.""	
 Rain grounded helicopters loaded with supplies this week,
forcing authorities to rely on roads and delaying aid, said the
U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Access
to water ""remains a concern"" in 11 prefectures, it added.	
 Makeshift evacuation centres, packed with hundreds of
shell-shocked survivors sleeping side-by-side for more than a
week, are orderly but clearly deteriorating in some regions,
beset by cases of diarrhea, influenza, stress and fatigue.	
 ""The only thing we can do is stick it out,"" said Takeshi
Murakami, 67, in Kesennuma in devastated Miyagi prefecture whose
governor reckons as many as 15,000 people were killed by the
March 11 quake and tsunami. 
 Murakami is staying in a school gym with about 450 others,
down from a peak of about 800 people last week. Hastily gathered
possessions are folded in tidy bundles next to sleeping bags.
Most escaped only with the clothes on their back. Few have
bathed since the 9.0 tremor. 
 Sleep at the shelter is often interrupted by the screams of
an Alzheimer sufferer during the night. Evacuees use portable
toilets outside the gym. In one section, the elderly lie on mats
on the wooden floor, receiving intravenous drips. 
 Telephone companies provide free services at the gym, where
an entire wall is jammed with notices posted by people seeking
help to find the missing. Without television, there is little to
do but talk, grieve and wait. Many huddle around heaters.	
 ""There is no privacy but you have to get used to it,"" said
Keiichi Kato, 49, who ran a children's clothing store before it
was obliterated, replaced by four washed up fishing trawlers.	
 
 
 SLOW PROGRESS 
 There is progress. The Tohoku Expressway connecting Tokyo
with quake-hit areas has re-opened to trucks. In Rikuzentakata,
where more than 80 percent of the estimated 8,000 households
were swept away, temporary homes are now being built.	
 About 5.5 million meals, 380,000 blankets and 90,000 diapers
had been distributed across the tsunami-ravaged region as of
Monday, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.	
 But it was unclear how many people these had reached.	
 An official at the Disaster Relief Headquarters in northern
Iwate prefecture, where 45,687 people were living in evacuation
centres as of Monday, said a shortage of fuel was preventing aid
from reaching hard-hit remote areas.	
 ""Relief goods are being sent to evacuation centres but
because of a shortage of fuel there's certainly not enough and
there are places that goods are not reaching,"" he said. 
 ""There are many places without electricity,"" he added. ""Some
people (in evacuation centres) are becoming ill.""	
 The U.N. humanitarian office reported trouble caring for the
disabled, especially the hearing impaired who in high-tech Japan
rely on e-mails sent by mobile phone to communicate. Much of the
mobile phone network remains down.	
 ""The psychological toll on those who survived the disaster
and are now in evacuation centres is becoming more apparent.
Many evacuees, including children, are suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorders,"" the U.N. agency said.	
 It is unclear how long people will stay in the shelters. An
exasperated Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi, last week asked
earthquake and tsunami victims to leave the prefecture due to a
shortage in housing. Some are quietly heeding his call.	
 About 10,000 people, on average, are leaving evacuation
centres a day, according to U.N. data. The Red Cross's Markus
said many are heading to homes of people not affected by the
disaster who have offered to take in survivors.	
 But some shelters remain over-crowded. At a sports arena in
Minamisanriku, a town in Miyagi prefecture that lost about half
its population, survivors are sprawled out on blankets on the
floor, separated by knee-high cardboard walls.	
 About 1,500 evacuees are staying there. About 20 left when
relatives managed to buy fuel and pick them up. Staff say the
centre exceeds capacity. Nearby evacuation centres are also
crowded.	
 Many wear surgical masks and wipe their hands regularly with
alcohol to prevent the spread of influenza. The elderly sit
dazed on benches. Teenagers crowd a booth to recharge mobile
phones. On standby are ambulances and a van with a dentist.	
 ""I can't think of anything other than electricity, water and
gas now,"" said Takuro Endo, 18, as he searches names on a wall
listing those in other evacuation centres. ""It could take 10
years for the town to recover.""
