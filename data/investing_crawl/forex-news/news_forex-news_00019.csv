The unemployment rate ticked down to 7.2%, from 7.4% in February. Analysts had expected the jobless rate to climb to 8.0% last month.       A separate report showed that the number of new building permits issued in Canada rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.5% in February, more than doubling expectations for a 3.0% gain.     The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.49% to hit 80.30. Meanwhile, investors are awaiting U.S. non farm payrolls and the long Easter weekend. "

31,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2012 12:05PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD sharply lower on strong U.S. employment data,"Investing.com - The euro traded lower against the U.S. dollar Wednesday as concerns over the debt crisis in the euro zone combined with strong U.S. employment data to power the greenback higher on the session.EUR/USD hit 1.3108 during U.S. morning trade, the pair’s lowest since March 16; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3127, giving back 0.81%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3048, the low of March 16 and resistance at 1.3238, the session high. Dampening the enthusiasm for the greenback, the Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index declined by 1.3 points to 56.0 last month from a reading of 57.3 in February.   Analysts had expected the index to decline by 0.3 points to 57.0 in March. Earlier in the day, payrolls processing firm ADP reported that the U.S. private sector added 209,000 jobs last month, outstripping expectations for an increase of 200,000. February’s figure was revised up to a gain of 230,000 from a previously reported increase of 216,000. This report is thought to be a precursor to the official numbers that are released on Friday. The reports came one day after the minutes of the Fed’s March meeting showed that policymakers will refrain from launching a third round of quantitative easing unless the rate of U.S. growth falters or inflation drops below the central bank’s 2% targeted rate. Sentiment on the euro was hit by fresh concerns over the debt crisis in the euro zone, after a poorly received auction of Spanish government debt earlier saw the country’s borrowing costs rise. Spain’s Treasury auctioned EUR2.59 billon of government bonds, short of the maximum targeted amount of EUR3.5 billion, in the country’s first debt auction since last week’s austerity budget. Following the auction, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed to 5.7%, up from 5.5% before the sale. On Tuesday, Spain’s government announced that the country’s public debt will rise to a record 79.8% of gross domestic product this year. Meanwhile, concerns over the outlook for growth in the euro zone mounted following a flurry of weak economic data. Government data confirmed that the euro zone service sector contracted for the sixth time in seven months in March, increasing the likelihood that the economy has entered a technical recession. The final euro zone services purchasing managers’ index was revised up to 49.2 in March, from a preliminary estimate of 48.7, but remained below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion. A separate report showed that euro zone retail sales fell by 0.1% in February, against expectations for a 0.1% increase and were 2.1% lower year-on-year. Elsewhere, official data showed that German factory orders rose 0.3% in February, below expectations for a 1.2% increase, renewing concerns over the economic outlook for the bloc’s largest economy. The euro was sharply lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY tumbling 1.02% to hit 108.46 and was also weaker against the pound, with EUR/GBP shedding 0.63% to hit 0.8264. In addition Wednesday, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest unchanged at 1.00%, in a widely expected decision. Following the decision, ECB President Mario Draghi said that growth has “stabilized at low levels” and that a moderate recovery is expected in course of the year"

The Commerce Department reported U.S. factory orders climbed 1.3% in February, erasing the previous months downwardly revised 1.1% decline, but missed expectations for a 1.5% increase. Investors are proceeding with caution prior to the Federal Reserve minutes, that may signal a third round of monetary easing to support growth. Meanwhile, concerns over the economic outlook for the euro zone were increased after official data confirmed that the regions economy contracted by 0.3% in the final three months of 2011, unchanged from a preliminary estimate. Annualized gross domestic product contracted by 0.7% in the fourth quarter. In addition, Monday’s data showed that manufacturing activity in the euro zone remained in contraction territory for the eighth successive month in March, while a separate report showed that the bloc’s unemployment rate ticked up to a record high of 10.8% in February. The euro remained higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP up 0.54% to hit 0.8356 and EUR/JPY adding 0.20% to hit 109.54.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD giving back 0.11% to hit 1.3326. Creating weakness in the euro, revised data indicated that manufacturing in the euro zone remained at a three-month low in March, remaining in contraction territory for the eight successive month. Adding to the euro zone worries, another report indicated that the unemployment rate in the region ticked up to a record high of 10.8% in February from 10.7% the previous month, broadly in line with expectations. The greenback was slightly lower against the pound, with GBP/USD inching up 0.09% to hit 1.6022. The pound gained ground on a report showing that U.K. manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest rate in 10 months in March. The U.K. manufacturing PMI rose to 52.1 last month from an upwardly revised 51.5 in February, confounding analysts' expectations for a drop to 50.5. The greenback was sharply lower against the stronger yen but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY dropping 0.94% to hit 82.08 and USD/CHF adding 0.43% to hit 0.9061. An index of sentiment at Japanese manufacturers declined more-than-expected in the first quarter, fanning concerns that the Bank of Japan may implement fresh easing measures, weighing on the yen. Meanwhile in Switzerland, a report indicated that manufacturing activity improved more-than-expected in March, expanding for the first time in seven months.  A separate report showed that Swiss retail sales rose less-than-expected in February. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD sliding 0.34% to hit 0.9948, AUD/USD climbing 0.50% to hit 1.0402 and NZD/USD advancing 0.48% to hit 0.8222. The Australian dollar found support after data indicated that manufacturing activity in China jumped to an 11-month high in March, easing concerns over a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. China is Australia’s largest export destination. In Australia, official data showed earlier that building approvals fell unexpectedly in February, declining 7.8% after a 1.1% rise the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, traded lower by 0.11% to hit 79.03. In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management said its index of purchasing managers rose to 53.4 in March, up from a reading of 52.4 the previous month.  Analysts had expected the ISM index of purchasing managers to rise to 53.0."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was modestly higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.07% to hit 1.3304. Sparking the flight to the safety of the greenback, the Commerce Department reported durable goods orders rose 2.2% in February, partially reversing the previous months revised 3.6% decline, but fell short of expectations for a 3.0% increase. Core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation, rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.6% in February, compared to expectations for a 1.5% gain. The data came one day after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that it was still too early to declare victory in the U.S. economic recovery, fanning speculation that the central bank may embark on a third round of monetary easing to shore up growth. The euro came under pressure earlier after the head of Germany’s central bank said that a larger euro zone bailout fund would not resolve the debt issues in the region and might even make the crisis worse. Euro zone finance ministers are to hold talks in Copenhagen on Friday, amid speculation that they will reach an agreement on a larger debt firewall to combat the debt crisis in the region. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD dropping 0.42% to hit 1.5882. The pound weakened broadly after official data showed that the U.K. economy contracted by 0.3% in the last three months of 2011, more than the preliminary estimate of a 0.2% contraction. The greenback was lower against the yen, but eased higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY losing 0.53% to hit 82.74 and USD/CHF rising 0.06% to hit 0.9059. The yen firmed as Japanese companies moved to repatriate overseas earnings before the end of Japan’s fiscal year on March 31. Elsewhere, the greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD climbing 0.24% to hit 0.9972, AUD/USD dropping 0.84% to hit 1.0370 and NZD/USD down 0.44% to hit 0.8167. Sentiment on the commodity linked Australian and New Zealand dollars was hit following a sharp drop in Chinese equities markets earlier, amid concerns over a possible slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.14% to hit 79.38."

The euro remained under pressure as concerns over Spanish borrowing costs weighed ahead of the country’s budget statement on Friday, amid fears that the government will pull back on imposing harsh austerity measures despite a potential recession. Meanwhile, a report earlier showed that an index of German consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in March. The euro was lower against the pound but eased higher against the yen, with EUR/GBP slipping 0.15% and EUR/JPY rising 0.11% to hit 110.76. Also Tuesday, Eurogroup chairman Olli Rehn said that euro zone finance ministers would reach an agreement on the size of the bailout fund for indebted countries at a meeting to be held in Copenhagen on Friday. “We have already taken significant decisive steps towards a stronger and permanent firewall to contain contagion and calm down market stability if it arises. Further reinforcement will be decided on Friday, which will help us remove any remaining doubts”, he said."

It hit a low of 1.3179 and a high of 1.3285 during the session. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3048, the low of March 16 and resistance at 1.3284, the session high and a nine-day high. The greenback weakened against the euro after the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales gave back 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted 4.59 million units in February, compared to expectations for a decline to 4.61 million units.  The figure is 8.8% higher than the 4.22 million-unit level in February 2011. Existing home sales in January was revised down by nearly 1.5% to 4.63 million units from a previously reported 4.57 million.  Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, stated underlying factors are much better compared to one year ago,  “The market is trending up unevenly, with record high consumer buying power and sustained job gains giving buyers the confidence they need to get into the market,”.His words added dollar bullish sentiment to the negative numbers. In Greece, former Deputy Finance Minister Filippos Sachinidis was sworn in as the country’s new finance minister. On Tuesday, Greece repaid EUR14.5 billion in maturing debt, just one day after receiving the first tranche of aid, under the terms of its second bailout.  Germany and Portugal sold bonds at an auction today helping to ease slowdown fears. Meanwhile, worries persist that Japan will move to boost stimulus having far reaching economic consequences.        Elsewhere, the euro was fractionally lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP dipping 0.07% to hit 0.8330.

Economists had forecast housing starts little changed at a 0.70 million-unit rate.  Building permits jumped 5.1% to a seasonally adjusted 0.72 million, above expectations for a modest 0.6% gain to 0.69 million.  In the euro zone, market participants were awaiting the outcome of talks between Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and union leaders to discuss reforms to the country’s labor market, as he attempts to turn around the euro zone’s third largest economy.     The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD shedding 0.22% to hit 1.5858.     Earlier Tuesday, the Confederation of British Industry said industrial order expectations declined more-than-expected in March, easing off the previous month’s six-month high.     But sterling remained supported after official data showed that the annual rate of consumer price inflation in the U.K. eased to the lowest since November 2010 in February, dampening expectations for a fresh round of easing measures by the Bank of England.     The greenback was hovering just below an 11-month high against the yen, with USD/JPY advancing 0.43% to hit 83.70 and was slightly higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF easing up 0.04% to hit 0.9116.     In Switzerland, official data showed that industrial production jumped in the last three months of 2011, rising 7.9% and exceeding expectations for a 0.4% gain.     Elsewhere, the greenback posted strong gains against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD climbing 0.57% to hit 0.9925, AUD/USD slumping 1.12% to hit 1.0488 and NZD/USD tumbling 0.98% to hit 0.8180.     Sentiment on the commodity linked currencies was hit earlier amid fresh worries over a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy, after global miner BHP Billiton said that Chinese demand for iron ore is slackening, sparking concerns that commodity prices may decline.     Sentiment on the Aussie and the kiwi was further undermined after the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s March meeting showed that policymakers believe there is ""ample scope"" to cut interest rates in the event of a sharp slowdown in the economy arising from the debt crisis in the euro zone.     The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.21% to hit 79.85. "

Minutes from the BOJ policy meeting revealed that one member said the central bank should aim for 2% inflation. During the meeting, the bank surprisingly expanded its asset purchase program by 10 trillion yen and set an inflation goal of 1% Elsewhere, the greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand cousins, with USD/CAD rising 0.03% to hit 0.9923,AUD/USD climbing 0.11% to hit 1.0537 and NZD/USD adding 0.41% to hit 0.8224.     The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.32% to hit 80.34.     On Thursday, government data indicated that U.S. producer price inflation rose slightly less-than-expected in February, increasing by a seasonally adjusted 0.4%, below expectations for a 0.5% gain, while core producer prices rose 0.2% last month, meeting expectations. "

In addition, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment is expected to hit a one year high of 76 in March adding to the greenback’s bullishness. The actual report will be released later in the session. Worries that the European Central Bank may refrain from taking further action to fight Europe’s debt crisis, despite inflation nearing its 2% limit even as the economy contracts weighed on the single currency. The ECB stated in its monthly bulletin yesterday inflation is likely to stay above 2% with prevailing upside risk, increasing euro zone worries.    Sparking the greenback’s rally,  investors reduced expectations for additional monetary easing after the Fed upgraded its outlook for the economy during the rate statement Tuesday.     The euro was lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP falling 0.20% to trade at 0.8309, but advanced against the yen, with EUR/JPY adding 0.16% to trade at 109.50. "

The annual rate of inflation was in line with preliminary estimates, while the figure for January was revised up to 2.7% from 2.6%.     The euro was lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP shedding 0.30% to trade at 0.8306, but advanced against the yen, with EUR/JPY adding 0.56% to trade at 109.14.     In Greek news Wednesday, Eurogroup leader Jean-Claude Juncker stated euro zone finance ministers had formally approved the release of a second financial aid package for Greece, worth EUR130 billion. "

Supporting the single currency, euro zone finance ministers were holding talks in Brussels, to discuss the final approval of a EUR130 billion bailout for Greece.  However, the euro remained under pressure after the International Swaps and Derivatives Association announced Friday that Greece’s debt swap with private creditors constituted a “credit event”, which would activate credit-default swaps, designed to protect investors against losses on Greek sovereign debt. Meanwhile, the greenback remained supported as Friday’s strong U.S. employment data lowered expectations for a fresh round of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve to help stimulate economic growth. The Department of Labor said the U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 210,000 gain. The unemployment rate held steady at a three year low of 8.3%. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.27% to hit 1.5630. The greenback was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY giving back 0.32% to hit 82.21 and USD/CHF sliding 0.23% to hit 0.9168. Earlier in the day, Japanese officials reiterated concerns over the strength of the yen, despite a recent weakening in the currency. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said that the yen was still ""strong,"" while Finance Minister Jun Azumi reiterated warnings against any ""excessively speculative movements."" The greenback held gains against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand cousins, with USD/CAD up 0.30% to hit 0.9934, AUD/USDfalling 0.74% to hit 1.0496 and NZD/USD dropping 0.41% to hit 0.8179.Dollar sentiment was lowered earlier after government data showed that China posted the largest trade deficit in 12 years in February, as exports declined.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3043, the low of February 15 and resistance at 1.3240, the high of March 5. Weighing  on the single currency, China posted its biggest trade deficit since at least 1989 for last month. This report added to the slow factory orders and retail sales reports from last week, increasing global slowdown fears and worries about monetary easing. However, China’s central bank stated it will maintain prudent fiscal policy but will take pre emptive measures if needed. In Greek news, finance ministers from the euro zone met in Brussels today to approve the island nation’s bailout package. The ministers were also likely to discuss Spain, after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced earlier this month that the country would cut its deficit to 5.8% of gross domestic product, instead of the planned 4.4% in 2012. Last week bondholders agreed to swap Greece’s privately held debt for new securities increasing hopes of economic improvement in the struggling country. In Portugal bonds are yielding over 13% resulting in worries that the nation is next in line for a bailout Meanwhile, the greenback remained supported as Friday’s robust U.S. employment data lowered expectations for additional monetary easing from the Fed. The Department of Labor said the U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 210,000 gain. The unemployment rate held steady at a three year low of 8.3%.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was sharply lower against the euro, with EUR/USD climbing 0.81% to hit 1.3257. The greenback was weakened after the Department of Labor said earlier that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose to a seasonally adjusted 362,000, confounding expectations for a decline to 350,000.     The previous week’s figure was revised up to 354,000 from 351,000.German industrial output figures beat estimates lifting risk sentiment away from the safety of the U.S. dollar. Powering the euro higher were hopes of Greece  securing a debt swap deal with its private creditors ahead of the 6am GMT deadline, clearing the way for the country to secure its second bailout and avert a default. Earlier in the day, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1% for the third consecutive month.  Speaking at the bank’s post policy meeting press conference, ECB President Mario Draghi said that the bank’s recent liquidity boosting operation was an ""unquestionable success”.

The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.43% to hit 1.5808. Sterling had been almost unchanged after the Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5% earlier Thursday and announced no expansion to its GBP325 billion asset purchase program, following a GBP50 billion increase in February. The greenback was higher against the yen but posted steep losses against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.71% to hit 81.67 and USD/CHF tumbling 0.85% to hit 0.9088. The yen came under pressure earlier after data showed that Japan’s current account balance swung to a record deficit of JPY437.3 billion in January, prompting Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa to reiterate that the bank was prepared to loosen monetary policy again if needed to support the economy. A separate report confirmed that Japan’s gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% in the last three months of 2011, in line with earlier estimates.  In Switzerland, government data showed that consumer price inflation rose more-than-expected in February, ticking up 0.3% after a 0.4% decline the previous month. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.42% to hit 0.9932, AUD/USD rising 0.24% to hit 1.0608 and NZD/USD rallying 0.79% to hit 0.8227. The Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1% earlier and said that recent developments indicated that the outlook for the Canadian economy had “marginally improved” since the bank’s last policy meeting in January, while uncertainty over the global economic outlook had decreased. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.56% to hit 79.28.

A report from ADP employer services indicated that U.S. companies added 216,000 workers in February compared to 170,000 in January, supporting the greenback. In bearish news, German factory orders surprisingly declined in January missing estimates for a 0.6% increase.

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.74% to hit 1.3120. Worries over the threat of a default by Greece increased ahead of the March 8 deadline for the country’s private creditors to sign on to a EUR106 billion debt swap deal, a requirement for Athens to tap a recently approved EUR130 billion bailout fund. Earlier in the day, Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos strongly urged private sector creditors to take part in the debt swap deal and warned that it was the best offer they would receive. However, only 20% of private Greek creditors have agreed to the swap signaling deeper problems ahead. Adding to the negative tone, data  confirmed that the euro zone’s gross domestic product shrank by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in the last three months of 2011, in line with expectations and unchanged from a preliminary estimate.  Annualized GDP contracted at a rate of 0.7%, also in line with expectations and unrevised from an initial estimate. The data increased concerns over the outlook for global growth, coming one day after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said his government will target expansion of 7.5% in 2012, the lowest GDP target in eight years. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD plunging 0.95% to hit 1.5716. Earlier in the session, a report by mortgage lender Halifax showed that U.K. house prices fell unexpectedly in February after rising in January and continuing the mixed monthly pattern seen over the past year. The data came after a report by the British Retail Consortium showed that total retail sales rose at an annualized rate of 2.3% in February, after a 2.1% gain the previous month.

The single currency selling was ignited when news hit the wire that only 20% of Greek’s private bond holders have agreed to the bond swap settlement criteria. Greece has set a 75% participation limit to proceed with the debt swap plan.  The under enthusiastic response from private creditors has made it clear that the Greek debt issue is far from resolved. The goal of the debt swap, which runs until March 8, is to lower by 53.5% the total amount of private debt to prevent an uncontrolled default. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the euro zone’s gross domestic product fell 0.03% from the third quarter, confirming the February 15 estimate. The data fuelled concerns over the outlook for global growth, coming one day after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said his government will target expansion of 7.5% in 2012, the lowest GDP target in eight years. Elsewhere, the euro fell sharply against the yen, with EUR/JPY tumbling 1.70% to hit 105.96, and climbed against the pound, with EUR/GBP climbing 0.23% to hit 0.8349.

However,  the euro found support after official data showed that retail sales advanced for the first time in five months in January, increasing by a seasonally adjusted 0.3%, defying expectations for a 0.1% decline.  The positive data offset a report showing that the euro zone's services sector contracted at faster rate than initially estimated in February, shrinking for the fifth time in six months. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.19% to hit 1.5864.  Earlier Monday, data showed that the U.K. service sector expanded in February, however at a slower than expected pace, increasing hopes that the economy will avoid a first quarter recession. In addition, the greenback was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY shedding 0.49% to hit 81.40 and USD/CHF giving back 0.21% to hit 0.9120.  In Switzerland, government data indicated that retail sales climbed at the fastest rate in seven months in January, surging 4.4%, after a 1.7% increase the previous month. Meanwhile, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD advancing 0.48% to hit 0.9938, AUD/USD falling 0.59% to hit 1.0668 and NZD/USD tumbling 0.89% to hit 0.8216.   In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management reported its non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index climbed to 57.3 in February from a reading of 56.8 the previous month.

In Greek news, investors are awaiting to determine how many private investors agree to write down their sovereign debt holdings by the March 8 deadline. Greece has set a 75% participation rate as the limit for proceeding with the transaction.  Private investors are urged to forgive Greece 53.5% of their principal and swap their remaining holdings for new Greek bonds and notes from the European Financial Stability Facility.   This is causing much trepidation as Germany’s DSW investor protection group has advised private creditors to reject the offer.

EUR/USD pulled back from 1.3486 to trade at 1.355 down 0.77% on the session, The pair was likely to find support at 1.3388,  Tuesday’s  low and technical resistance at 1.3486, the sessions  and  12-week high. The greenback gained strength as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke failed to signal further monetary easing in the world’s largest economy. Bernanke stated that keeping monetary stimulus steady was warranted despite falling jobless claims and rising oil prices potentially increasing inflation.  The Fed Chief added, policy makers believe that “sustaining a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives” of the Fed for stable prices and maximum employment. The European Central Bank said it will lend 800 financial institutions EUR529.5 billion for 1092 days. This is higher than the estimated loan level of EUR470 billion easing systematic risk fears. In additional euro zone news, European Union Competition Commissioner, Joaquin Almunia stated that EU leaders may consider relaxing budget deficit targets to take into consideration economic growth. However, government data showed that euro zone consumer price inflation eased in January to 2.6%  instead of the forecasted 2.7% In Greek news, Finland’s parliament endorsed Greece’s second bailout helping euro zone sentiment.

Sparking the euro rally, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel won a parliamentary vote to provide Greek aid after the close of trading Monday. Merkel warned policy makers that pushing Greece out of the euro zone risked “incalculable” damage. However, Greece’s credit rating was slashed to selective default by Standard & Poors after the island nation negotiated the biggest national debt restructuring in history. The European Central Bank will allocate cash from its long term refinancing fund tomorrow. It is expected to provide EUR470 billion of three year cash to help stabilize the euro zone. Consumer sentiment is on the upswing in the euro zone region. An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17 nation group climbed for a second month in February to 94.4, beating analysts’ expectations of a gain to 94. In addition, German consumer confidence is expected to increase to a 12 month high in March due to declining unemployment, according to GfK SE. Meanwhile, in the U.S., durable goods orders plummeted 4%, whereas economists were expecting a 1% decline, adding to the single currency’s appeal. However, another report showing that U.S. consumer confidence climbed to the highest level in a year during February, counteracted the bearish durable goods numbers. A separate report showed that U.S. home prices fell more-than-expected in December, declining for the 18th consecutive month. Euro sentiment remained supported as investors looked ahead to Wednesday's launch of the European Central Bank’s second three-year long-term refinancing operation, after a similar cash injection in December averted a credit crunch and eased pressure on euro zone bond markets. In other news, Portugal’s finance minister said earlier that his country had passed the third review of its EUR78 billion bailout by the troika, which is composed of the ECB, EU and International Monetary Fund, and added that the country’s fiscal targets for 2012 would be met in spite of deteriorating domestic economic conditions. The euro was higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP easing up 0.09% to hit 0.8474 and EUR/JPY climbing 0.30% to hit 108.32. "

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.45% to hit 1.3388. Euro zone finance ministers and central bankers met in Mexico and urged G-20 nations to find additional funds that the IMF could provide to the euro zone. IMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde stated at the meeting that she wants to increase the fund’s lending capacity by USD500 billion to protect the global economy from further shocks. Pressuring the single currency lower, the G-20 leaders told the euro zone to provide more financial strength before they would consider providing support. The primary onus fell on Germany, which is already the largest national contributor to the bailouts. German Chancellor, Angela Merkel said there is no need to increase the lending capacity of the euro zone’s bailout fund, citing lowered borrowing costs as evidence. In Greek news, Germany’s parliament is holding a vote on the second Greek bailout package in Berlin today. The country needs to decide if it will back plans at a March 1-2 European Union summit to combine rescue funds for the euro zone and create a EUR750 billion financial firewall. In euro positive news, the single currency found some support as markets looked ahead to a liquidity boosting operation by the ECB, set to take place on Wednesday, after a similar operation in December eased pressure on bond markets. The central bank announced earlier that it had not purchased any euro zone government debt on the secondary bond market for the second consecutive week since it re-launched its bond purchasing program in August. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.30% to hit 1.5824. The greenback fell against the yen but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY plunging 1.02% to hit 80.38  and USD/CHF adding 0.38% to hit 0.8994. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.07% to hit 0.9987, AUD/USD rising 0.69% to hit 1.0769 and NZD/USD rising 0.53% to hit 0.8404. In New Zealand, government data indicated that the trade balance dropped  to a deficit of NZD199 million in January, from a surplus of NZD306 million the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, inched up 0.14% to hit 78.59. In the U.S., a report by the National Association of Realtors indicated that pending home sales climbed to a two-year high last month, increasing by 2%, doubling expectations for a 1% gain and indicating more favorable conditions in the housing market. "

763,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2012 08:33AM ET</span>","Forex - U.S. dollar lower on strong euro zone numbers, ECB support","Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against its major counterparts Friday, as stronger than expected German business confidence figures and European Central Bank support fuelled euro zone confidence. During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.28% to hit 1.3411. The ECB may be tapped next week for EUR470 billion in three year funds for distribution on February 29. This is nearly the same amount that was provided in December, according to a Bloomberg survey. This infusion of cash is expected to prolong the rally in the bond markets and will be used primarily to support the Italian and Spanish bond markets. Euro zone inflation is in check and no floor exists under the 1% interest rate, ECB council member Erkki Liikanen told CNBC, calming fears of upside risk in the region. Yesterday, the euro found strength when German research institute Ifo said its Business Climate Index rose to109.6 in February from a reading of 108.3 the previous month, surpassing expectations for an increase to 108.8, increasing hopes that the euro zone’s largest economy is on the road to recovery. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.48% to hit 1.5820. The pound found support after the Confederation of British Industry reported  that U.K. factory orders rebounded to hit a six-month high in February, rising by 13 points to minus 3.0, from a reading of minus 16 in January. The greenback was higher against yen but  lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY gaining 0.65% to hit 80.53  and USD/CHF giving back 0.31% to hit 0.8988. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said earlier that he wants to have one-on-one talks with the Bank of Japan governor more frequently and to boost cooperation with the central bank. The comments came after the BoJ’s decision last week to increase the size of its asset-purchase program to JPY30 trillion, sending the yen broadly lower. In addition, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD retreating 0.20% to hit 0.9993,AUD/USD  falling 0.06% to hit 1.0711 and NZD/USD slipping 0.01% to hit 0.8364. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.12% to hit 78.58. In the U.S., a report by the Department of Labor showed that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 18 held steady at 351,000, missing expectations for an increase of 3,000 to 354,000.  Jobless claims have remained below 400,000, a level historically associated with an improving labor market, in 15 of the past 17 weeks. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the euro was fractionally higher against the dollar, with EUR/USD dipping 0.13% to hit 1.3251. Investors remained jittery amid sustained concerns over whether a second EUR130 billion bailout for Greece will be enough to resolve the country’s fiscal woes as the economic situation continues to deteriorate. Earlier Wednesday, ratings agency Fitch cut Greece’s credit rating to C from CCC and reiterated that a bond-swap agreement with private creditors would be a restricted default. Fitch said it would review its stance on Greece again once the debt swap had been completed. Meanwhile, preliminary data showed that manufacturing activity in the euro zone improved less-than-expected in February, remaining in contraction territory for the seventh consecutive month, while service sector activity contracted unexpectedly. Data from Germany and France showed modest growth in business activity, albeit at a slower pace than in January, but activity other euro zone nation’s showed a steep decline in February. In euro bullish news, a separate report showed that new euro zone industrial orders increased by 1.8% in December, erasing the previous month’s 1.1% drop. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD giving back 0.68% to hit 1.5672.. Sterling weakened  after the minutes of the Bank of England’s February meeting showed that two policymakers supported a GBP75 billion increase to the bank’s asset purchase program this month, while the remainder of the monetary policy committee voted in favor of a GBP50 billion increase to GBP325 billion. The greenback was higher against the yen but slipped lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY climbing 0.72% to hit 80.32 and USD/CHF falling 0.26% to hit 0.9102. The yen has remained under pressure since last week’s decision by the Bank of Japan to implement fresh monetary easing measures to insulate the economy from the effects of the strong yen. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.25% to hit 0.9994, AUD/USD falling 0.14% to hit 1.0647 and NZD/USD falling 0.71% to hit 0.8276.

This contraction of service and manufacturing output signals additional struggles ahead for the euro zone region. Another report showed German services and manufacturing expansion surprisingly slowed in February further adding to the lack luster euro performance.. Meanwhile, in Greece, Fitch Rating slashed the island nations credit grade two levels to C from CCC after the country obtained approval to proceed with the bond exchange  to reduce its debt burden. Adding to the Greek fears, Bank of England Deputy Governor, Charlie Bean stated, “While the agreement is certainly welcome, there still remains a possibility that events could unfold in a disorderly and damaging fashion at some time in the future.”  The euro was higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP advancing 0.81% to hit 0.8454 and EUR/JPY climbing 0.85% to hit 106.44.

The single currency was bolstered after the details of a new financial package for Greece, which will reduce the country’s debt to 120.5% of gross domestic product by 2020, were released.  In addition, private sector creditors agreed to accept a write-down on their bonds of more than 53%, which is projected to slash Greece's debt by EUR107 billion. However,  the initial optimismt of the deal faded amid concerns over Greece’s ability to implement the terms of the package and the country’s deteriorating economic situation.  Meanwhile, the Troika, which is composed of the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, said in its latest report on Greece's debt sustainability that ""additional debt relief"" will be required in the future. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD giving back 0.40% to hit 1.5787. Official data indicated that U.K. public finances posted their largest monthly surplus since January 2008 last month. Public sector net borrowing or the difference in value between public spending and income moved to a surplus of GBP10.7 billion in January, from a deficit of GBP11.1 billion the previous month. The U.S. dollar was slightly higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.12% to hit 79.72 and USD/CHF gaining 0.02% to hit 0.9118. Earlier in the day, government data showed that Switzerland's trade surplus declined unexpectedly in January, falling to CHF1.55 billion from CHF2 billion the previous month as exports fell 3.4% on the month. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD gaining 0.20% to hit 0.9956,AUD/USD dropping 0.65% to hit 1.0685 and NZD/USD giving back 0.63% to hit 0.8346.

A separate report, showing that Canadian wholesale sales rose by 0.9% December, beating expectations for a 0.5% gain, offset the impact of the retail sales data. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, eased higher by 0.01% to hit 79.11. Also Tuesday, Germany’s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the IMF could contribute as much as EUR23 billion to the Greek rescue package, but added that a final decision would be made at a meeting next week."
830,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 21, 2012 01:02PM ET</span>",EUR/USD higher on muted Greek bailout bullishness,"Investing.com - The euro traded higher against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, but the reaction to the Greek bailout package was muted as investors remain uncertain if it will be sufficient to avoid default.EUR/USD traded at 1.3258 during mid session U.S. trade after hitting a high of 1.3293 and a low of 1.3187. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3114, last Friday’s low and technical resistance exists at 1.3293, the session high. The single currency struck the high against the greenback earlier after euro zone finance ministers settled on the details of a new financial package for Greece, which aims to lower the country’s debt to 120.5% of gross domestic product by 2020. Private-sector creditors also agreed to take a write-down on their bonds of more than 53%, which is expected to cut Greece's debt by EUR107 billion. However, fears that the bailout package is not enough were sparked by an International Monetary Fund report forecasting Greek debt ballooning to 160% of gross domestic product by 2020. In addition, unless 90% of investors agree to the bond swap, Greece may need to use force to obtain debt relief, causing legal issues. Further worries of the incoming Athens government not enforcing the agreed upon austerity measures kept the single currency rally in check. Meanwhile, the Troika, composed of the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, said in its latest report on Greece's debt sustainability that ""additional debt relief"" will be required in the future. Elsewhere, Spain saw short-term borrowing costs fall to the lowest level in two-years following an auction of government debt that met with solid investor demand. The euro was higher against the pound and against the yen, with EUR/GBP adding 0.41% to hit 0.8388 and EUR/JPY climbing 0.19% to hit 105.65. In other Greek news, Germany’s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble stated that the IMF could contribute as much as EUR23 billion to the Greek rescue package, but added that a final decision would be made at a meeting next week. "

The single currency found support as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels increasing expectations that they would approve  a second bailout worth EUR130 billion as well as a concurrent debt restructuring deal for Greece. Speaking before the meeting, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said “We expect the long period of uncertainty, that benefitted neither the Greek economy nor the euro zone overall, to end today”. Sentiment on the euro also improved after the German central bank said in its February report that the country’s economy will make a rapid return to growth this year, despite the debt crisis in the euro zone. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD advancing 0.11% to hit 1.5845. Earlier in the day, a report by property website Rightmove showed that average asking prices for houses in the U.K. jumped 4.1% in February, highest monthly increase since April 2002, indicating increasing confidence in the housing market. The greenback was flat against yen and lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY up 0.01%% to hit 79.57 and USD/CHF plummeting 0.91%, to hit 0.9116. The yen came under pressure earlier after official data showed that Japan posted a record JPY1.47 trillion trade deficit in January, raising concerns that the strong yen is having a negative impact on the country’s  export driven economy. Meanwhile, rating agency Standard & Poor's said earlier that the outlook on Japan's AA- sovereign credit rating remained negative and warned that it expected Japan's fiscal flexibility ""to continue to diminish."" The greenback also came under pressure after the People’s Bank of China said Saturday that it was to cut the reserve requirement ratios of major commercial lenders in an attempt to boost liquidity and spur growth in the world’s second largest economy. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.40% to hit 0.9932,AUD/USD climbing 0.42% to hit 1.0751 and NZD/USD advancing 0.85% to hit 0.8392. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, dropped 0.52% to hit 79.10. Trade volumes were expected to remain light on Monday, with markets in the U.S. remaining closed for the Presidents Day holiday. "

886,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 17, 2012 07:59AM ET</span>",Forex - U.S. dollar drops on improved risk sentiment,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against its global counterparts Friday, as risk sentiment improved following the release of better than expected U.S. data, but uncertainty over a second bailout deal for Greece continued to cloud the outlook for riskier assets. During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.22% to hit 1.3160. Euro zone finance ministers argued over how to best bail out Greece in last night’s conference call. Estimates that Greek debt would fall to 129% of gross domestic product by 2020, missing the 120% target casts fears over the viability of the proposed bail out. Greek’s sovereign lenders are considering charging lower interest rates to help the island nation avoid default. France suggested that central banks simply take the losses in Greek bonds, but this idea has not gained any support. A two step decision appears possible where a bond exchange is approved at the meeting next week, then completing the EUR130 billion public aid program. However, this would result in high political risk as two votes are required in some national parliaments. Earlier, risk sentiment improved after data indicated that U.S. initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell to their lowest level since March 2008 last week, declining to 348,000, missing expectations for an increase to 364,000. An index of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area rose more-than-expected in February, advancing to 10.2, above expectations for a rise to 9.0. In a separate report, the U.S. Census Bureau said the number of building permits issued in January rose 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted 0.68 million, broadly in line with market expectations. The greenback found support after ratings agency Moody's warned that it may cut the credit ratings of 114 banks in 16 countries across Europe, citing banks' vulnerability to the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD advancing 0.26% to hit 1.5840. Pound sentiment increased after the Bank of England’s quarterly inflation report Tuesday revised higher the bank’s two year inflation forecast, lowering expectations for more quantitative easing measures. Yesterday, a report by lender Nationwide showed British consumer confidence climbed to its highest level in five months in January as people's view of the outlook six months ahead grew more upbeat. The greenback was higher against yen but lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.38% to hit 79.23 and USD/CHF down 0.14%, to hit 0.9180. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian cousins and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD slipping 0.17% to hit 0.9950, AUD/USD adding 0.05% to hit 1.0759  and NZD/USD up 0.43% to  0.8366. Yesterday, official data showed that the Australian economy added 46,300 jobs in January, beating expectations for a 10,500 gain, bringing the unemployment rate down to 5.1%. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.10% to hit 79.39. "

911,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2012 01:01PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD higher on strong U.S. data,"Investing.com - The euro advanced against the U.S. dollar Thursday, as strong U.S. economic data supported risk sentiment but the single currency remained under pressure over Greek uncertaintyEUR/USD traded at 1.3106 higher by 0.30% after hitting a low of 1.2975 and a high of 1.3120 The pair was likely to find support at 1.2930, the low of January 25 and resistance at 1.3120, the session high. Risk sentiment was spurred as U.S. initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell to their lowest level since March 2008 last week, declining to 348,000, and positively surprising expectations for an increase to 364,000. An index of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area advanced more than expected in February, climbing to 10.2, beating expectations for an increase to 9.0. In another economically bullish report, the U.S. Census Bureau stated the number of building permits issued in January rose 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted 0.68 million, broadly in line with market expectations. However,  concerns over a delay on a second bailout for Greece persisted after a teleconference of euro zone finance ministers on Wednesday failed to reach a decision about the bailout. European Union officials are believed to be looking at delaying all or part of Greece's bailout until after a general election in the country,  expected to take place in April.  Policy makers are studying the potential of granting a bridge loan to Athens, allowing the island nation to meet EUR14.4 billion in repayments which come due on March 20, avoiding a default. The greenback was also supported after ratings agency Moody's warned that it may cut the credit ratings of 114 banks in 16 countries across Europe, citing banks' vulnerability to the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone. The euro was also lower against the pound, with EUR/GBP giving back 0.29% to hit 0.8302.

The euro came under pressure after ratings agency Moody's downgraded the credit ratings on six European countries, including Spain and Italy late Monday. France and Austria kept their top ratings but had their outlooks dropped to ""negative"" from ""stable."" Meanwhile, investors are awaiting the meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Wednesday, as officials were reviewing Greece’s budget to decide whether the country has met conditions to receive a second bailout package. Sentiment found brief support earlier after a report showed that German economic sentiment rose significantly more-than-expected in February, turning positive for the first time since May 2011, while economic sentiment in the euro zone rose to minus 8.1 from minus 32.5 in January. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD shedding 0.54% to hit 1.5680. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said the bank's Monetary Policy Committee expects inflation to fall back to ""around"" its 2% target by the end of 2012, although the pace and extent of the fall in inflation remain highly uncertain. The comments came after official data showed earlier that consumer price inflation in the U.K. rose 3.6% in January, in line with expectations, while retail prices rose less-than-expected in January, advancing 3.9% after a 4.8% increase the previous month.  The greenback was higher against yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 1.12% to hit 78.44 and USD/CHF advancing 0.44% to trade at 0.9208. Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan unexpectedly eased policy by adding JPY10 trillion to its asset-purchase program. The bank also set a 1% inflation target “for the time being” and stated that positive consumer-price growth would be defined as below 2% year-on-year. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD edging up 0.03% to hit 1.0000, AUD/USD falling 0.61% to hit 1.0667 and NZD/USD giving back 0.43% to 0.8303. Industry data showed earlier that an index of business confidence for Australia rose to 4 in January from 3 the previous month. In New Zealand, a report showed that house prices fell 1.4% in January after a 0.1% drop the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, soared 0.66% to hit 79.60. In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau stated that retail sales rose less-than-expected by 0.4% in January, missing expectations for a 0.8% increase. December’s figure was revised down to a flat reading from a previously reported 0.1% increase. The report also showed that core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose by 0.7% last month, above expectations for a 0.6% gain. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.11% to hit 1.3213.   The euro found support when Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos obtained parliamentary approval for the spending cuts by a vote of 199 to 74 for the austerity plans. Euro zone finance ministers are meeting on February, 15 to decide whether or not Greece should be approved for its second economic bailout package. Germany and European Commission appear pleased with the austerity plans, increasing hopes that the bailout will be approved. However, Greece needs to make a strong argument how EUR325 million of this year’s total budget cuts will be achieved before the bailout package will be approved. Greeks are burning buildings and rioting in Athens, protesting the wage, pension and job cuts in the austerity package increasing fears that the plan will not be implemented. Adding to the negativity, Fitch Ratings reiterated its opinion that Greece will default even if it obtains the bailout funds.Meanwhile, Italian borrowing costs declined at a debt auction today. Italy’s treasury sold EUR8.5 billion 365 day bills and EUR3.5 billion 127 day bills at lower rates than previous sales. In German news, the euro zone’s largest economy sold EUR3.01 billion of six month bills at an average yield of 0.0761%, up from a negative yield at a sale held on January 9. Last week,  the United States saw a surprising decline in the number of first time unemployment claims last week. This solidifies hopes that the economic recovery is continuing in the world’s largest economy. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.17% to hit 1.5782. Earlier, the Bank of England increased its quantitative easing program by GBP50 billion earlier, citing the ""significant margin"" of slack in the British economy and left interest rates unchanged at 0.5% in a widely expected decision. Meanwhile, official data showed that manufacturing production in the U.K. rose significantly more-than-expected in December, increasing for the first time in three months, while industrial production also rose more-than-expected. A separate report showed that the U.K. goods trade deficit narrowed more-than-expected in January. The greenback was higher against yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.01% to hit 77.67 and USD/CHF surging 0.72% to trade at 0.9184. In Switzerland a consumer climate index improved slightly more-than-expected in January. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD falling 0.24% to hit 0.9988, AUD/USD adding 0.71% to hit 1.0749 and NZD/USD soaring 1.07% to hit 0.8354.   Home loans climbed more than expected in Australia during December, advancing 2.3% after a 1.8% climb the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gave back 0.12% to hit 79.01. U.S. President, Barack Obama presented his annual budget, including a USD4 trillion plan to create jobs while reducing the federal budget deficit. "

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.82% to hit 1.3176.   Earlier, the single currencies rally was fuelled when Greek officials  reached an agreement on austerity measures needed to obtain a EUR130 billion bailout package. The troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund met in Brussels yesterday to determine if Greece has met its obligations to qualify for its second bailout package. The dollar gained strength after things did not bode well for Greece at the troika meeting in Brussels.. German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble stated that Greece is missing its debt cutting targets. Schaeuble explained that two people who spoke on conditions of anonymity, who attended the Brussels meeting, stated that Greece’s austerity plan would leave its debt as high as 136% of gross domestic product by 2020. The German Finance Ministry went on to state, “The Greek offer is not sufficient and they have to go away to come back with a revised plan.” As expected, Greece is facing mounting opposition to the austerity measures needed to qualify for its second bailout package. Greek Finance Minister Evangelo Venizelos stated that the parliamentary vote on the measures, set to begin this weekend, amounts to a ballot on euro membership.

Greek  political leaders  agreed on the conditions set by international creditors in exchange for a new bailout worth EUR130 billion. Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos was expected to present the details of the agreement for discussion at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers later Thursday in Brussels. Earlier in the day, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record-low 1.0% for the second consecutive month, in a widely expected decision. Speaking at the bank’s post-policy meeting press conference, ECB President Mario Draghi said collateral rules will be relaxed in order to ease credit conditions in the region. In addition, the ECB President said the central bank would not accept a loss on its holdings of Greek bonds, but stopped short of ruling out a role for the ECB in a new bailout package for Greece.

Jobless claims have remained below 400,000, a level historically associated with an improving labor market, in 13 of the past 15 weeks. "
