 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - Stocks and the euro fell on
Monday as fears the euro zone debt crisis could spread to Italy
caused investors to sell risky assets and snap up safe-haven
debt, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury
note below 3.0 percent.
 Italy has the second-highest sovereign debt ratio relative
to GDP in the euro zone, after Greece. Investors fear the
crisis may spread to the much larger economies of Italy and
Spain. See [ID:nL6E7IB06Z]and [ID:nLDE76A07W]
 ""Italy has a more realistic financial plan than Greece and
is much better equipped to meet their debt obligations,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New
York. ""However, that may not be enough to stop contagion fears,
which can be irrational at times.""
 The concern about Italy, the euro zone's third-largest
economy, prompted an emergency meeting of top European Union
officials. Italian government bonds and stocks dropped as
investors cut their exposure.
 U.S. stocks suffered their worst day in nearly a month
following the Italy news, along with concern about the
stalemate in U.S. budget talks.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 151.44 points,
or 1.20 percent, to end at 12,505.76. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> lost 24.31 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1,319.49.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slid 57.19 points, or 2.00
percent, to 2,802.62.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2 percent
to about a one-week low, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst
300 index <.FTEU3> of top shares fell 1.5 percent to close at
1,097.60, its lowest closing level since June 28.
 U.S. exchange-traded funds tracking European equity markets
also came under pressure. The iShares MSCI Italy Index Fund
, a fund that tracks Italian stocks, fell 6.2 percent
while the iShares MSCI Spain index fund  dropped 5.2
percent.
 Some analysts say if euro zone debt problems are not
contained, they could hurt the global economy, especially banks
exposed to the debt. The U.S. economy alone has struggled to
pick up the pace of its recovery from the worst downturn since
the 1930s.
 A weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday and data
showing China's import growth fell to its slowest pace in 20
months, suggesting a slowing economy, also drove investors away
from stocks.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  jumped
27/32 in price, pushing its yield back below 3.0 pct to a
two-week low at 2.92 percent from 3.02 percent late on Friday.
 ""We are seeing some follow-through buying in Treasuries,
and the European situation continues to fester. It is just an
environment where there are a lot of factors that are stacking
up as bullish for bonds,"" said Marty Mitchell, head of
government bond trading at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore.
 After the U.S. stock market close, aluminum maker Alcoa
, also a Dow component, reported earnings, unofficially
marking the start of the second-quarter U.S. reporting period.
Its shares rose 1 percent to $16.07 after the results.
 In the foreign-exchange market, the dollar <.DXY> rose 1.1
percent against a basket of major currencies.
 The euro  was down 1.8 percent at $1.4012 after
earlier hitting a session low at $1.3984, its lowest in six
weeks.
 ""Italy would be a challenge that makes Greece look
miniature by comparison,"" said Karl Schamotta, senior
strategist at Western Union Business Solutions in Calgary. ""We
have a wide-ranging contagion issue here -- or at least the
perception of one -- and that's making people very nervous.""
 JP Morgan said Italian banks are vulnerable because of
their high reliance on wholesale funding. Moreover, their
government bond holdings stand at 6.33 percent of assets,
higher than those of Spanish banks.
 Oil fell on the euro zone crisis as well, while gold prices
rose.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude for August
delivery  fell $1.05, or 1.09 percent, to settle at
$95.15 a barrel.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for August delivery 
settled at $117.24 a barrel, down $1.09, or 0.92 percent.
 Spot gold  , which is used as a safe haven in times
of global economic uncertainty, was up 0.4 percent at $1,550.10
an ounce.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - The euro plummeted against
the dollar and hit a record low against the Swiss franc on
Monday as worries the debt crisis in the euro zone could
infiltrate Italy prompted sweeping risk aversion.
 European Union finance officials discussed options for
resolving Greece's intractable debt crisis, galvanized by the
growing threat of contagion to Italy, the euro zone's
third-largest economy. For more see [ID:nLDE76A08F].
 The euro hit a four-month low against the yen and a
six-week trough against the dollar. A Financial Times report
that some European leaders would consider letting Athens
default on some of its bonds added to market anxiety.
 ""A default by Greece would be enough to set off a
widespread sell-off in the financial market but a default by
Italy would be worse than Lehman,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
currency research at GFT Forex in New York.
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi, speaking at a conference. said Italy is clearly able to
pay back its debt and will never default. [ID:nWEA7444]
 It is estimated that the top 91 banks have more than 100
billion euros worth of exposure to Italy, far more than
Greece's debt, while banks hold more Italian debt than Spanish
debt, Lien said.
 ""With that in mind, Italy has a more realistic financial
plan than Greece and is much better equipped to meet their debt
obligations,"" she said. ""However that may not be enough to stop
contagion fears which can be irrational at times.""

 Fears over Italy rippled throughout global financial
markets, sending stocks sharply lower while U.S. Treasury bond
and gold prices rose. [ID:nN1E76A0PU]
 Italy has the second highest debt-to-output ratio among the
17 countries that use the euro after Greece.
 ""Italy would be a challenge that makes Greece look
miniature by comparison,"" said Karl Schamotta, senior
strategist at Western Union Business Solutions in Calgary. ""We
have a wide-ranging contagion issue here -- or at least the
perception of one -- and that's making people very nervous.""
 The euro slid to $1.3984 , its lowest in six weeks.
It was last down 1.6 percent at $1.4032, its worst one-day
slide since June 15.
 The European Union will release results of new bank stress
tests on Friday.
 The euro also hit a four-month low of 112.37 yen 
and a record low of 1.1672 Swiss francs .
 Schamotta said the Swiss franc was looking stretched and
favored shorting the euro against sterling and the greenback,
which does well when the global outlook darkens and investors
cut risky trades financed with cheaply borrowed dollars.
 A weak U.S. employment report last week increased fears
that a slower U.S. economy could curb world growth.
 ""The picture looks bad right now, with slowing growth in
China, commodity imports slowing and very deep economic
uncertainty in Europe and the United States,"" he said.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was up 1
percent at 75.962 <.DXY>.
 But against the yen, the dollar fell to its lowest since
June 30, dropping 0.4 percent to 80.32 yen  after going
as low as 80.28. The looming threat of a U.S. debt default
may check the greenback's gains. President Barack Obama and
congressional leaders were in high-stakes talks to break the
impasse over raising the debt ceiling by Aug. 2. The White
House says failure to do so could result in a default.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - Stocks fell sharply and the
euro slid across the board on Monday on concern Italy could be
the next casualty of the euro zone debt crisis.
 Oil fell on fears of slowing demand, including a drop in
China's crude imports, while bond and gold prices rose as
investors sought less-risky assets.
 The concern over Italy, the euro zone's third-largest
economy, prompted an emergency meeting of top European Union
officials. New signs of tension in Italy's government and
problems for Economy Minister Giulio Tremont emerged.
 Italian government bonds and stocks dropped as investors
cut their exposure amid fears that the country, with the
highest sovereign debt ratio relative to GDP in the euro zone
after Greece, could be next to get dragged into crisis. For

 ""Even as we feel the U.S. soft patch is passing, the spread

 By Neal Armstrong and Nia Williams	
 LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - The euro hit a record low
against the Swiss franc on Monday due to concerns Europe's debt
crisis is spreading to its core economies, and the single
currency looked vulnerable to more losses. 
 Top EU finance officials gathered for an emergency meeting
in Brussels on Monday to discuss Greece's intractable debt
crisis, galvanised by the growing threat of contagion to
Italy. 
 A Financial Times report saying some EU leaders were
considering allowing a selective default by Athens to put its
debt on a more sustainable footing, also dented the single
currency, traders said.	
 Against the Swiss franc the euro hit a record low of 1.1790
francs , down 1.2 percent on the day. Euro selling
gathered pace after breaking through a large options barrier at
1.1800 francs as investors preferred safe-haven currencies on
the back of rising concerns about contagion from euro zone debt.	
 The single currency slid 1.3 percent to a near one-month low
of $1.4088 , as traders said stop-losses were triggered on
the break of a large option barrier at $1.4130. Downside support
is now seen around its 200-day moving average at $1.3923.	
 The euro also slipped 1.4 percent on the day versus the
Japanese yen to 113.36 yen .	
 ""The euro will be under pressure for the entire week,
there's plenty of event risk especially bank stress tests on
Friday,"" said Tom Levinson, FX strategist at ING.	
 ""This is a pretty challenging environment. We could see a
test of $1.4000 unless something comes from the euro zone
politicians to reassure the markets on Greece and Italy, and
that is unlikely.""	
 Italian bond yield spreads over safe-haven German Bunds hit
fresh euro lifetime highs on Monday and credit default swaps
also soared to record levels, extending moves from Friday when
new worries about contagion from Greece hit the market.

 Italy is the euro zone's third largest economy and has the
highest sovereign debt ratio relative to its economy in the euro
zone after Greece, raising fears it could be next to
suffer. 
 The results of European bank stress tests will be released
on Friday, and have contributed to concerns that fiscally
stretched countries like Italy might have to dig into their
pockets to bail out banks that fail. 
 Market players said Swiss franc strength was likely to hold
in such a jittery market. The chairman of the Swiss National
Bank was quoted on Sunday as saying there was no reason to curb
the currency's strength at the moment as price stability was not
yet under threat. 
 ""We have been overweight Swiss franc vs euro for quite a
while. This is working out in our favour and it's a position we
want to keep,"" said Stephane Monier, head of fixed income and
currencies at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, which has $36
billion in assets under management, of which $16 billion are
invested in fixed income assets. 
 ""Even though we are at new highs in the Swiss francs versus
the euro, we think this move will continue,"" he added.	
 Against the dollar, too, it is headed lower with technical
signals suggesting it is set for more losses as it fell below
trendline support from its May lows at $1.4156.	
 ""This trendline support is regarded as the break down point
to the 200-week moving average at $1.4024, the 1.3968 recent low
and the 200-day moving average at $1.3907,"" said technical
analysts at Commerzbank in a note.	
 
 DOLLAR INDEX 
 Worries over global growth added to demand for perceived
safe-haven currencies including the U.S. dollar, after a
disappointing U.S. employment report and data showing rising
inflation in China spooked investors.

 The dollar index rose around 0.8 percent to a
two-week high of 75.807, up from Friday's low at 74.843. It
faces resistance at its mid-June peak of 76.015.	
 However the looming threat of a U.S. debt default may check
the greenback's gains. President Barack Obama and congressional
leaders of both parties were in high-stakes talks to break the
impasse over raising the debt ceiling. 
 The dollar stood at 80.60 yen , up 0.2 percent from
late U.S. trade on Friday, supported by bids from Japanese
importers, but below Friday's five-week high around 81.50 yen. 
 Global growth worries pulled commodity currencies lower as
the Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.0688. The
New Zealand dollar slipped 0.4 percent to $0.8339,
pulling back from Friday's record high near $0.8400.

 LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - World stocks hit one-week lows
and the euro slid across the board on Monday as intensifying
concerns that Italy could be the next victim of the euro zone
debt crisis prompted an emergency meeting of top European
officials.	
 Fresh signs of tension in Italy's government and problems
for Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti -- trusted by financial
markets to cut spending -- prompted a sell-off in the country's
government bonds. Italy has the euro zone's highest sovereign
debt ratio relative to its economy after Greece.

knows where this is going to stop and when the next domino will
fall,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley.	
 ""Italy is in a different order of magnitude from Greece,
Portugal and Ireland and takes the crisis to a whole new level.""	
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.7 percent
to a one-week low. 
 European stocks fell 0.7 percent while emerging
stocks lost 1 percent. U.S. stock futures fell almost
1 percent , pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street
later.	
 The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index rose 7.9 percent,
its highest in nearly two weeks.	
 JP Morgan says Italian banks are vulnerable because of their
high reliance on wholesale funding. Their loan-to-deposit ratio
stands at 1.42 -- higher than that of Spanish banks and above
the average of 0.9 for French and German banks.	
 Moreover, their government bond holdings stand at 6.33
percent of assets, higher than those of Spanisn banks.	
 ""The higher the market pressure on BTPs, the lower the
appetite of Italian banks to sponsor their domestic government
bond market for fear of raising their sensitivity to the
sovereign even further,"" the bank said in a note to clients.	
 Bund futures  rose 50 ticks. The Italian/German
10-year yield spread widened by 14 basis points to
258 bps, as BTP futures  tumbled more than 100 ticks to
103.29.	
 Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council,
will meet European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
and Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the Eurogroup, ahead of
a meeting of the 17 euro zone finance ministers later. 
 ""Concerns over Italy show contagion risks in the euro zone
are increasing. Investor confidence remains low and will limit
demand for euro denominated assets,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency analyst at UBS in Zurich. 
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent against a basket of major
currencies. The euro extended earlier losses to lose 0.7
percent on the day to $1.4113.

 LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday,
hurt by concern that the debt crisis is worsening as European
officials gathered for an emergency meeting in Brussels, with a
weakening technical outlook opening the way for further weakness
in the single currency. 
 The euro fell following news over the weekend that European
Council President Herman Van Rompuy had called an emergency
meeting of top officials dealing with the euro zone crisis for
Monday morning, amid concern that the problems could spread to
debt-laden Italy. 
 A Financial Times report saying some EU leaders were
considering allowing a selective default by Athens, to put its
debt on a more sustainable footing, also dented the single
currency, traders said.	
 The euro took a hit on Friday when Italian bond yields
soared to euro lifetime highs, raising fears that Italy, with
the highest sovereign debt ratio relative to its economy in the
euro zone after Greece, could be next to suffer. 
 The 10-year yield spread between Italian and German debt
widened further on Monday as concerns over contagion prompted
investors to sell Italian paper in favor of safe-haven German
Bunds. 
 ""Concerns over Italy show contagion risks in the euro zone
are increasing. Investor confidence remains low and will limit
demand for euro-denominated assets,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency analyst at UBS in Zurich. 
 In addition to Monday's emergency meeting, events to watch
for this week include the results of stress tests of European
banks, which are due to be released on July 15. 
 The euro slid almost 1 percent to a two-week low of $1.4133
, with its technical picture becoming more negative as it
fell below trendline support from its May lows at $1.4156. 
 ""This trendline support is regarded as the break down point
to the 200-week moving average at $1.4024, the 1.3968 recent low
and the 200-day moving average at $1.3907,"" said technical
analysts at Commerzbank in a note. 
 Traders said a large option barrier at $1.4130 may slow
further falls in the euro in the near term. 
 The euro fell 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1840
francs , nearing a record low of 1.1808 hit in late
June on trading platform EBS.	
 Traders said further upside in the Swiss franc was likely
after the chairman of the Swiss National Bank was quoted on
Sunday as saying there was no reason to curb the currency's
strength at the moment as price stability was not yet under

 The euro fell 0.7 percent against the yen to 114.15 yen

safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and the U.S.

June, adding to concerns about the health of the world's biggest
economy. 
 Data on Saturday showed annual inflation in China
accelerated to a three-year high in June with the consumer price
index up 6.4 percent from a year earlier, slightly above analyst
expectations. 
 The dollar index rose 0.6 percent to 75.614, up from

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, July 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell back
close to a record low versus the Swiss franc and hovered near
chart support versus the Australian dollar on Monday, hurt by
renewed jitters over the euro zone's debt crisis ahead of an
emergency meeting of European officials.	
 The euro fell following news over the weekend that European
Council President Herman Van Rompuy had called an emergency
meeting of top officials dealing with the euro zone debt crisis
for Monday morning, reflecting concern that the crisis could
spread to Italy. 
 A Financial Times report saying some EU leaders were
considering allowing a selective default by Athens, to put its
debt on a more sustainable footing, also dented the single
currency, traders said.	
 Such news added to the euro's woes, which took a hit on
Friday when Italian bond yields soared to euro lifetime highs,
raising fears that Italy, with the highest sovereign debt ratio
relative to its economy in the euro zone after Greece, could be
next to suffer in the crisis. 
 ""Risk aversion among investors may rise on the concerns over
Europe, at least temporarily, and cause the euro to underperform
in the near-term,"" said Junya Tanase, chief FX strategist for
JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo.	
 Events to watch for this week include the results of stress
tests of European banks that will be released on July 15 as well
as Monday's emergency meeting, Tanase said. 
 The euro slid 0.6 percent to $1.4182 and fell 0.4
percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1890 , nearing a
record low of 1.1808 hit in late June on trading platform EBS.	
 Traders said further upside in the Swiss franc was likely
after the chairman of the Swiss National Bank was quoted on
Sunday as saying there was no reason to curb the currency's
strength at the moment as price stability was not yet under
threat. 
 Against the dollar, one support for the euro lies near
$1.4155, trendline support drawn off the euro's May trough just
below $1.40 and its June 27 low near $1.41. 
 ""But the news over the weekend could trigger a significant
move to the downside in the euro, by the time we get through
this week,"" warned Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 Gibbs said he could see the euro fall towards $1.3500 over
time given the severe deterioration in the peripheral euro zone
sovereign debt markets.	
 The euro was testing support on the crosses, with
euro/Aussie easing 0.1 percent to 1.3240 , near
support at 1.3220, a trough hit on May 11 and again on Friday. A
drop below there would take euro/Aussie down to a six-month low.
 
 
 DOLLAR INDEX ABOVE TRENDLINE 
 Renewed pressure in the euro helped lift the dollar against
a basket of major currencies. The dollar index rose to
75.451, up from Friday's low at 74.843.	
 The dollar index has climbed back above trendline resistance
drawn off a peak hit in June 2011. The dollar index faces more
resistance at its mid-June peak of 76.015. A clear breach of
such resistance could set the dollar index up for further gains.	
 Euro zone worries and disappointing U.S. data weighed on
risk appetite, knocking commodity currencies lower. The
Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to $1.0707.	
 There was little reaction to Australia's carbon tax package
unveiled on Sunday, which the country's treasurer said would be
budget neutral and not affect the government's aim to bring the
budget back to surplus in fiscal year 2012/13. 
 ""There may be some damage to consumer and business
confidence in the near term, now that the affected groups are
able to pinpoint the precise impact on their budgets,"" said
Stephen Walters, JPMorgan chief economist. 
 ""On the flip side, though, removal of some of the policy
uncertainty could mitigate against some of the negative impact,
assuming government representatives do a decent job of selling
it over the next few weeks.""	
 Data last Friday showed U.S. jobs growth nearly halted in
June, adding to concerns about the health of the world's biggest
economy. 
 The dismal jobs report was also seen complicating efforts to
avert a looming U.S. debt default. President Barack Obama and
congressional leaders of both parties were in high-stakes talks
to break the impasse over raising the debt ceiling.

 The dollar stood at 80.76 yen , up 0.2 percent from
late U.S. trade on Friday, supported by bids from Japanese
importers, but remained below Friday's five-week high around
81.50 yen.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 11 (Reuters) - The euro weakened in Asia on Monday ahead of
an emergency meeting among European policymakers on the sovereign debt crisis
while equities snapped three consecutive weeks of gains on weak data from the
world's two biggest economies.	
 The single currency held near a record low against the Swiss franc on
growing worries that the debt crisis was now beginning to infect the continent's
big economies such as Italy -- the region's third biggest.	
 Markets have barely begun recovering from an extended period of volatility
in the first half of 2011, when concerns around slowing growth in China, an
extended slump in the U.S. and worrisome news from the euro zone have begun to
resurface, deterring demand for risky assets once again. 
 Australian stocks was the region's worst performer, shedding 1.6
percent, after the government unveiled a plan to tax carbon emissions from the
nation's worst polluters, sending shares of coal miners, steel and airlines such
as Macarthur Coal , BlueScope Steel and Virgin Australia
tumbling. 
 Japanese shares fell 0.7 percent after hefty gains last week, with
banks bearing the brunt of the losses. 
 In Europe, stock index futures point to a lower open with STOXX Europe 50
futures  down 0.7 percent, futures for Germany's DAX index  are
down 0.2 percent and those for France's CAC-40  down 0.5 percent.

 However, steep declines may be unlikely before the earning season kicks off
with Alcoa this week, as most Asian markets are trading above the day's
lows with some scattered buying seen in defensive counters like utilities.	
 ""The correction has been relatively mild and suggests that investors are not
all that bearish as they could have been, suggesting a preference towards buying
on dips rather than selling into strength,"" said Khiem Do, chairman of Asia
multi-asset team at Barings Asset Management in Hong Kong.	
 ""This is a good day for bargain hunting, especially among investors who
haven't participated in the rally earlier.""	
 Before Monday's drop of 1.2 percent, the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan had gained for three consecutive weeks as
investors bet that the second half held better prospects for risky assets than
the first.	
 But Friday's much-awaited U.S. non-farm payrolls data revealed the economy
created only 18,000 jobs in June, well short of an expected 90,000, dashing
optimism that the economy was emerging from a soft patch. 
 Adding to worries on the global economy, data showed annual inflation in
China accelerated to a three-year high in June while import growth slowed to its
a two-year low. {ID:nL3E7I901B]

 NUANCED APPROACH	
 In currency markets, the euro held around the $1.42 line on some
light short-covering after falling to a two-week low of $1.4187 in early Asian
trade with some technical support seen around the $1.4150 line. 
 Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, the common currency slipped
back towards a record low of 1.1808 hit in late June on EBS. 
 European Council President Herman Van Rompuy has called an emergency meeting
of top officials dealing with the euro zone debt crisis for Monday morning,
reflecting concern that the crisis could spread to Italy, the region's third
largest economy. 
 Even as investors fretted about its fiscal health, pushing Italian bond
yields to euro lifetime highs on Friday, the Financial Times reported that some
EU leaders were considering allowing a selective default by Athens to put its
debt on a more sustainable footing. 
 Taking a leaf out of the weaker tone in equities, most Asian currencies
slipped against the dollar with the weak payrolls data implying policymakers
would be reluctant to use currency gains to counter rising inflation in the face
of weak external demand.	
 Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics at HSBC says price pressures in
much of Asia is driven by local demand which exchange rate swings can do little
to counter, suggesting central banks would rely on more traditional methods of
policy tightening such as interest rates. 
 Reduced demand for risk boosted prices of perceived safe-haven assets like
U.S. Treasuries and gold with yields on 10-year U.S. notes steadying at
3.01 percent on Monday from 3.18 percent barely a week ago. Gold held above the
$1540 an ounce line.	
 Oil trended lower with U.S. crude  falling by more than $3 to below
$96 a barrel as the weak data cast a shadow on the economic outlook.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world
fell on Friday and oil prices slumped as a dismal report on
America's labor market disappointed investors expecting a
stronger recovery in the world's largest economy.
 Gold capped its best week of the year and investors rushed
into U.S. Treasury debt, turning safe-haven investments into
the day's top performers.
 The U.S. Labor Department said the country's non-farm
payrolls -- a key indicator for global markets -- grew by only
18,000 in June, the weakest reading since September, and well
below economists' expectations of a gain of 90,000. For
details, see [ID:nN1E7670C0]
 ""It's a terrible number. There is no good news you can
glean from it,"" said David Semmens, U.S. economist at Standard
Chartered in New York.
 U.S. stocks' benchmark S&P 500 index fell almost 1.0
percent, erasing much of the gains over the last two sessions.
 Anxiety about another recession spurred a stampede into
short-term interest-rate futures. Investors now expect the
Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero into late
2012 to support the fragile economy.
 The spot price of gold shot up almost 1.0 percent for the
day. Longer-dated Treasuries surged a full point or more, while
the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hovered at around 3.0
percent.
 In commodity markets, U.S. crude oil futures prices 
closed down 2.5 percent, the most in two weeks, and in
currencies, the dollar fell against the yen and Swiss franc.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 62.29 points, or 0.49 percent, at 12,657.20. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 9.42 points, or 0.70
percent, at 1,343.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 12.85 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,859.81.
 Global stock prices retreated from five-week highs to head
lower. European stocks slid as the negative sentiment emanating
from the U.S. jobs report added to worries about the euro-zone
banking sector in Greece, Portugal and Ireland in particular.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.8
percent to 344.64. The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> also
slid 0.8 percent to close at 1,114.44. An index of emerging
market stocks <.MSCIEF> hit a two-month high before slipping
0.4 percent to 1,163.50.
 The U.S. dollar fell as low as 80.48 yen  following
the jobs data, from a session high of 81.48 yen. Against the
Swiss franc , the greenback was last trading down 0.9
percent at 0.8367 francs.
 The price of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond 
rose after the June payrolls report fueled bets on tame
inflation and the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low
for longer than previously thought. The long bond surged almost
1 1/2 points - or 1-14/32 in price to 101-19/32, while its
yield slid to 4.28 percent late Friday afternoon, from 4.37
percent late on Thursday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  gained
1-1/32 in price to 100-29/32, while its yield declined to 3.02
percent from 3.14 percent on Thursday.
 In European debt markets, German Bunds rallied and the
bonds of some poorer nations came under pressure as concerns
over slow progress on a second Greek fiscal bailout and the
health of European banks underpinned demand for safe-haven
assets.
 Oil prices slid in volatile trade after the U.S. payrolls
data dashed hopes of investors who had positioned themselves
for a much stronger number.
 U.S. crude oil  tumbled 2.5 percent to settle at
$96.20 a barrel, having erased all of Thursday's gains.
London's Brent  closed down 0.3 percent at $118.33 a
barrel, as concerns over the tighter supply for that type of
crude helped it perform better than U.S. crude. [O/R]

 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - The dollar is likely to trend
lower in the week ahead in the aftermath of an abysmal U.S.
jobs report on Friday and without clear signs of progress on
the approaching U.S. debt ceiling deadline.
 The U.S. dollar fell against the yen, Swiss franc and
sterling on Friday as significantly weaker-than-expected U.S.
jobs data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will
leave interest rates low well into next year.
 The U.S. Treasury runs out of cash to pay its bills on
Aug. 2 unless the government is legally allowed to borrow more.
With the United States long regarded as the most stable country
with its currency used as the global reserve, even talk of a
U.S. debt default has sent shudders through international
markets.
 The rapidly approaching deadline has for now overshadowed
debt problems in the euro zone.
 Friday's jobs report showing only meager growth in June
payrolls added to the gloom surrounding the U.S. dollar as
investors see the government and Federal Reserve as failing in
efforts to stoke economic growth despite a huge stimulus
program and rise in borrowings.
 ""U.S. policy (on debt) has been extend and pretend,"" said
Douglas Borthwick, managing director of Faros Trading in
Stamford, Connecticut. ""We've come to an end of that.""
 The euro is down 1.9 percent  against the dollar this
week, while the dollar is down 0.2 percent against the yen
. The euro is now up 6.6 percent against the dollar year
to date, while the dollar is down 0.7 percent against the yen
in 2011.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversals last traded at -2.55
on Friday , according to Reuters data, with a bias
toward euro puts and dollar calls, suggesting more investors
are betting the euro will fall than will rise.
 But investors are less bearish than a few weeks ago when
the same risk reversal traded at -3.4, its lowest since June
2010.
 Trying to break a budget deadlock and allow for an increase
in the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, Obama and congressional
leaders are aiming for more than $2 trillion in budget savings
and possibly as much as $4 trillion.
 With Republicans and Democrats still far apart, U.S.
President Barack Obama has scheduled another round of talks for
Sunday.
 ""It's not like there's some imminent deal about to happen,""
said House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner at a news
conference. ""There are serious differences about how to deal
with this very serious problem."" [ID:nWEN5166].
 While no deal is expected, investors will be seeking any
clue that there is at least compromise.
 ""Any headline indicating they are closer to an agreement
will be dollar positive,"" said Jessica Hoversen, foreign
exchange and fixed income analyst at MF Global in New York.
 BAD JOBS DATA
 U.S. employment growth ground to a near halt in June, data
from the U.S. Labor Department on Friday showed, with employers
hiring the fewest workers in nine months, dampening hopes the
economy was on the cusp of regaining momentum after stumbling
in recent months. [ID:nN1E7670C0]
 The euro  initially tumbled to a session low of
$1.4204 on Reuters data, then trimmed losses, with traders
saying the sharp drop toward the $1.42 level triggered
short-term buying.
 It last traded at $1.4255, down 0.7 percent on the day.
 ""It's a terrible number, there is no good news you can
glean from it,"" said David Semmens, U.S. economist at Standard
Chartered in New York. ""I don't think this puts pressure on the
Fed to do more, though.""

 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Friday,
snapping a two-day run-up, and oil slumped as a dismal report
on America's labor market in June disappointed investors
expecting a stronger recovery in the world's largest economy.
 Global equities retreated from five-week highs to head
lower and European stocks fell too as the negative sentiment

peripheral euro zone banking sector.
 Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index fell more than 1

 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - U.S. and overseas stocks fell
on Friday after the U.S. government's June jobs report came in
way below market expectations, also knocking oil prices down
and trimming the dollar's gains against the euro.
 Worries about the peripheral euro zone banking sector had
earlier tipped world stocks off five-week highs and sent
European equities lower.
 The U.S. Labor Department's closely watched employment
report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by only 18,000, the weakest
reading since September and well below economists' expectations
of a 90,000 rise. For more, see: [ID:nOAT004829]
 The disappointing jobs report revived a bid for U.S.
Treasuries.
 Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index fell more than 1
percent, snapping eight straight days of gains that resulted in
a cumulative 6.7 percent rise.
 Analysts said the jobs report stunned investors after
optimistic forecasts following Thursday's report from private
payrolls processor ADP.
""(This is) very disappointing and more from a positioning
standpoint where some shorts had thrown in the towel over the
last several days and especially yesterday,"" said Michael
Marrale, managing director and head of sales trading at RBC
Capital Markets in New York.
 ""I would expect them to re-engage on the back of this
number,"" Marrale said, suggesting further heavy selling.
 At 10:45 a.m. EDT (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was down 119.35 points, or 0.94 percent, at
12,600.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 15.49
points, or 1.14 percent, at 1,337.73. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> fell 31.31 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,841.35.
 Global stocks briefly extended Thursday's five-week highs,
before falling along with equities in Europe and emerging
markets.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down 0.8
percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> lost 0.7 percent.
Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> hit two-month highs before
retreating 0.3 percent.
 Prices on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds  were up
nearly a point after the June payrolls report fueled bets on
tame inflation and the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates
low for longer than previously thought.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
30/32, its yield at 3.031 percent.
 In Europe, German Bunds rallied and peripheral nations'
bonds came under pressure as concerns over slow progress on a
second Greek bailout and the health of European banks
underpinned demand for safe-haven assets.
 Oil prices slid in volatile trade after the U.S. payrolls
data dashed hopes of investors who had positioned themselves
for a strong number.
 U.S. crude oil  was down almost 3 percent, trading at
just above $96 a barrel and erasing all of Thursday's gains.
London's Brent crude  was down 1 percent, hovering
around $117 a barrel. [O/R]
 The euro  trimmed losses against the dollar after
tumbling to a session low of $1.4204, Reuters data showed.

 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets were poised
to open weaker on Friday and stocks elsewhere lost ground after
the U.S. government's jobs report for June came in way below
market expectations, also sending oil prices down and trimming
the dollar's gains.

 On Wall Street, U.S. stock index futures weakened ahead of

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Carolyn Cohn	
 LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - Worries about the peripheral euro
zone banking sector tempered optimism over upcoming U.S.
employment data on Friday, knocking world stocks from earlier
five-week highs and weakening U.S. stock index futures ahead of
the Wall Street open.	
 Italian debt insurance costs rose by more than 10 percent
and the euro fell on concern Italy's banking sector may need
additional cash after EU stress tests.	
 Italian bank UniCredit was down 4.4 percent on
resuming trade after being suspended limit down. 
 World stocks hit five-week highs, before steadying, in
anticipation of strong U.S. jobs data which could boost optimism
about the economy, though oil prices fell as investors booked
profits after sharp gains the previous day.	
 A report on Thursday showing U.S. companies hired four times
more workers in June than in May prompted several economists to
raise forecasts for the government's non-farm payrolls report
later in the day.	
 Economists in a Reuters survey last week forecast an
increase of 90,000 non-farm jobs after May's gain of 54,000. But
economists now believe employment probably rose anywhere between
125,000 and 175,000. 
 U.S. weekly jobless claims also added to expectations the
U.S. economy was bouncing back from a soft patch. 
 ""It's all about the non-farm payrolls. The market will be
expecting a higher number after the ADP report,"" Philip
Isherwood, European equities strategist at Evolution Securities,
said. 
""It seems to me the soft patch that people thought would turn
into recession is overstated."" 
 The MSCI world equity index steadied after
earlier hitting five-week peaks on rising optimism about the
global economy. Emerging market stocks hit two-month
highs before retreating.	
 U.S. stock index futures    were down
slightly, pointing to a lower open on Wall Street. The
pan-European share index was last up 0.15 percent,
recovering some ground after turning negative on the banking
worries.	
 World stocks are up 5 percent this year and have
outperformed emerging markets by a factor of three. Investors
expect this gap to narrow in coming weeks as the improving
economic outlook is likely to encourage investors to sustain a
shift towards emerging market assets that began last week.

 EURO UNDER PRESSURE 
 Brent crude oil  prices fell as the previous day's
rally prompted some to take profit before the U.S. jobs report.
ICE Brent crude  was down 0.9 percent at $117.68.	
 U.S. Treasuries extended the previous day's falls triggered
by upbeat data. The benchmark 10-year T-note yield
was up 1.5 basis points at 3.156 percent, nearing a six-week
high of 3.22 percent hit last week.	
 German Bunds rallied and peripheral bonds came under
pressure as concerns over slow progress on a second Greek
bailout and about the health of European banks underpinned
demand for safe-haven assets.	
 European countries will support banks that fail stress tests
if those lenders cannot raise capital from investors within six
months, according to a draft EU document seen by Reuters.

 The yield premium of Italian government debt over benchmark
Bunds rose to a euro-era record high of 228 basis points on
worries that the weaker euro zone economies that are already in
a delicate fiscal situation would be in even deeper trouble if
they were forced to bail out some of their banks. 
 The euro reversed gains against the dollar with worries
about the release of bank stress test results next week
offsetting the fillip from the European Central Bank's offer on
Thursday to provide liquidity to hard-pressed Portugal
regardless of its ratings.	
 ""The market is nervous about the broader health of the euro
zone given its debt problems ... what the banking sector will
look like after this, and how we resolve the peripheral issue,
and that will always limit the upside for the euro,"" Daragh
Maher, senior currency strategist at Credit Agricole CIB said.	
 The euro was last 0.6 percent down against the dollar
at $1.4270. 
 Spot gold was steady at $1,528 an ounce.

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, July, 8 - The euro slipped to a session-low versus
the dollar on Friday, dogged by concerns that European banks
were struggling as the euro debt crisis festers, while investors
braced for the possibility of strong U.S. employment data later
in the day.	
 Some in the market said a European Union draft report
outlining measures to deal with weak banks pushed the euro to
the day's low around $1.4310. 
 Stop-loss orders triggered around $1.4330 added to the
euro's selling momentum, but traders cited bids around $1.4300
and below, which stemmed a further move lower.	
 Few investors were keen to take aggressive positions in the
euro ahead of U.S. non-farm payrolls at 1230 GMT, which are
expected to show a strong reading following a big boost in
private jobs on Thursday.	
 ""The market is nervous about the broader health of the euro
zone given its debt problems ... what the banking sector will
look like after this, and how we resolve the peripheral issue,
and that will always limit the upside for the euro,"" said Daragh
Maher, senior currency strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.	
 He said the euro's rally on a strong reading of the U.S. ADP
private hiring report on Thursday may leave the single currency
vulnerable to a disappointing reading from non-farm payroll
numbers later in the day.	
 But traders said the market was positioning for an upside
reading of payrolls. Reuters earlier polling of analysts
forecast an increase of 90,000 U.S. jobs in June but some
economists have lifted their forecasts in the wake of the ADP
reading, with the latest data seen showing gains of anywhere
between 125,000 and 175,000 jobs. 
 By 0820 GMT, the euro had slipped 0.3 percent on the
day to a session low of $1.4305 according to electronic trading
platform EBS.	
 Traders said selling by Russian names had pushed the single
currency lower, while good bids were seen ahead of $1.4300,
while more were seen below that level.	
 The dollar edged up slightly on the day to 75.075,
and traded up 0.1 percent on the day tat 81.30 yen, holding
gains from the previous day, when it rose to around 81.40 yen,
its strongest in around a month.	
 
 MORE EURO GAINS?	
 Another strong jobs report may boost investors' appetite for
risk and add to the euro's upward momentum after it jumped on
Thursday, when the European Central Bank signaled that euro zone
interest rates would continue to rise and offered to provide
liquidity to Portugal regardless of its dismal credit rating.	
 ""If we get a payrolls report that is decent but not too
elevated it will still signal a recovery while the Federal
Reserve is still very much on hold (on U.S. rates),"" said Carl
Hammer, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.	
 The ECB also signalled a further tightening was likely this
year, after delivering a widely expected hike. 
 But analysts warned the road ahead for the euro remains
rocky. Next week, euro zone finance ministers meet to discuss
the broad outlines of a second bailout package for Greece. 
 ""The worrying thing here is that the 'fix' to the current
concerns can only come from agreement on a second package for
Greece, and that now seems unlikely before the end of August,""
said Rob Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 8 (Reuters) - Asian stocks are set for
their third consecutive week of gains on expectations later on
Friday of strong U.S. jobs data, which would encourage investors
to sustain a shift towards emerging market assets that began
last week.	
 A report on Thursday showing U.S. companies hired four times
more workers in June than in May prompted several economists to
raise forecasts for the government's non-farm payrolls count due
later in the day and bolster hopes the world's biggest economy
may have firmly turned a corner. 
 A Reuters survey conducted last week found that economists
were looking for an increase of 90,000 non-farm jobs after May's
meager 54,000 gain. But economists now believe employment
probably rose anywhere between 125,000 and 175,000. 
 If the U.S. is seen to be on a steadier footing, reluctance
by investors to add risk in emerging markets will diminish.	
 Risky assets, particularly in Asia, have had a rocky first
half due to concerns ranging from rising inflation to a hard
landing in China and have only begun to recover somewhat since
last week on expectations of a better second half.	
 Even the euro , beaten around this week thanks to a
steady stream of bad news from rating agencies, steadied after
the European Central Bank raised interest rates and said more
increases are likely. 
 The MSCI world index , which is up nearly 6
percent this year, has outperformed its emerging market
counterpart so far this year by a factor of three.
Investors expect this gap to quickly narrow in coming weeks.	
 On Friday, Hong Kong shares climbed 0.8 percent,
helped by shares of cyclical sectors like materials and
resources while Korean shares took a breather after
seven consecutive sessions of gains.	
 Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.7 percent. It hit a
four-month peak in intraday trade.	
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.7 percent, reaching a June 1 peak. For
the week, it is up about 2 percent.	
 
 CHEAP VALUATIONS	
 Strong gains in Asian equities since last week gathered
momentum as fears of an imminent Greek debt default ebbed and
encouraged investors to load up on relatively cheap assets like
Chinese banks. 
 ""The Chinese banks that you can invest in are like state
utilities and they are not going to flounder because the state
is not going to allow them to,"" said Marshall Mays, founder of
Emerging Alpha Advisors, in a Reuters television interview.	
 With valuations trading near troughs last seen during the
financial crisis, market players suggest a short-term bounce in
mainland financial shares is possible.	
 ""I think they are a good safe bet to buy on dips,"" he said. 
 A gauge measuring the performance of Chinese financials in
Hong Kong is up by more than 4.5 percent in the last
two weeks.	
 Other risky assets also rose. The New Zealand dollar
held near a 30-year high against the U.S. dollar while the
Australian dollar flirted with a 26-year peak versus
the sterling.	
 In another sign of increased tolerance towards high yielding
assets, investors pumped funds into both equity and fixed-income
funds for the week ended July 6, with corporate high-yield funds
breaking a five-week streak of net redemptions, data from Lipper
showed. 
 In currencies, the euro held firm in the middle of a
1.49-1.39 range carved since May. It last traded at $1.4351,
with resistance looming at $1.4395-$1.4400, the 50 percent
retracement of the July 4-7 decline and 55-day moving average. 
 In bond markets, Treasuries had a torrid session due to the
strong U.S. data with yields on ten-year notes
hovering around 3.15 percent, nearing a six-week high of 3.22
percent hit last week.	
 U.S. crude futures edged up a few cents to $98.71 per
barrel after rising by more than $2 in the previous session as
the U.S. data fueled hopes the economic recovery was regaining
traction.	
 Demand for perceived safe-haven assets like gold was
tarnished due to the increased risk tolerance, with gold
and silver dipping slightly.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - World stocks hit five-week
highs on Thursday as data on U.S. private sector hiring boosted
optimism about the economy, while oil prices posted their
biggest gain in two months on strong fuel demand.
 The euro rose against the dollar for the first time in
three sessions after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank would relax rules and keep
providing liquidity to struggling Portugal, allaying worries
about Europe's debt crisis. For details see [nLDE7660BO].
 On Wall Street, stocks rallied, with the Nasdaq notching an
eighth day of gains, as surprisingly strong hiring by U.S.
private employers in June and strong retail sales added to
optimism a day before the critical June payrolls report.
 Payrolls processor ADP reported that U.S. private employers
added 157,000 jobs last month, more than double the 68,000
expected by the market. [ID:nN1E7660BF]
 ""We went through a multi-month period of disappointing
data, and now it is coming in better than anticipated, and that
reset of expectations is providing a nice tailwind to markets,""
said Gary Flam, portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment
Advisors in Los Angeles.
 Wall Street was also boosted by a decline in the number of
claims for new jobless benefits. [ID:nN1E76602K]
 Analysts said stocks could rally further on Friday if the
Labor Department puts June jobs growth at more than 125,000.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 93.47
points, or 0.74 percent, at 12,719.49. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 14.00 points, or 1.05 percent, at
1,353.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 38.64
points, or 1.36 percent, at 2,872.66.
 Global and European stocks hit their highest levels since
June 1. The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.8
percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
closed up 0.4 percent at 1,123.32.
 Oil prices surged as the stronger labor market data and
decline in U.S. crude stockpiles supported views of an economy
in recovery.
 Stockpiles fell an unexpectedly high 3.2 million barrels
last week ahead of the long Independence Day weekend, data from
the American Petroleum Institute showed. The United States is
the world's largest energy consumer.
 Brent crude oil settled up more than 4 percent above $118
per barrel in London , its highest since May 9,
according to Reuters data. U.S. crude  finished up 2
percent at above $98 .
 The euro was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at
$1.43490 , rebounding from a session low of around
$1.42, Reuters data showed.
 The euro zone single currency recouped losses against the
dollar as investors were encouraged by the ECB's decision to
suspend minimum credit rating requirements for Portugal's debt
despite the recent Moody's downgrade of its rating to junk.
 The ECB's decision to help Portugal ""has provided more
reassurance that European authorities will support the euro at
almost any cost,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""That has taken away
some of the uncertainty.""
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell as the encouraging jobs data
and the ECB's support for Portugal reduced worries about the
economy and sovereign fiscal problems in Europe.
 The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note  last
traded at 8/32 in price to yield near 3.14 percent, below the
six-week high of 3.22 percent set last week.
 Treasuries fared slightly better than German Bunds. The
10-year Treasury yield premium over 10-year Bunds shrank to
17.9 basis points from 18.8 on Wednesday.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - World stocks hit five-week
highs on Thursday as encouraging data on U.S. private sector
hiring boosted optimism about the economy, while oil prices
gained their most in two months on strong fuel demand.
 The euro rose against the dollar for the first time in
three sessions after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank would relax rules and keep
providing liquidity to struggling Portugal, allaying worries
about Europe's debt crisis. For details see [nLDE7660BO].
 U.S. stocks climbed after news of a sharp rise in
private-sector jobs raised expectations that Friday's
government report on June payrolls will provide more evidence
of an improving labor market. Payrolls processor ADP reported
that U.S. private employers added 157,000 jobs last month, more
than double the 68,000 expected by the market. [ID:nN1E7660BF]
 Analysts said stocks could rally further on Friday if the
Labor Department puts June jobs growth at more than 125,000.
 ""We went through a multimonth period of disappointing data,
and now it is coming in better than anticipated, and that reset
of expectations is providing a nice tailwind to markets,"" said
Gary Flam, portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors in
Los Angeles.
 Wall Street was also boosted by a decline in the number of
claims for new jobless benefits and by strong U.S. retail
sales. Several top companies reported better-than-expected
sales gains for June by using bargains to lure shoppers in an
uncertain economy. [ID:nN1E76602K]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 114.93
points, or 0.91 percent, at 12,740.95. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 15.75 points, or 1.18 percent, at
1,354.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 41.74
points, or 1.47 percent, at 2,875.76.
 Global and European stocks hit their highest levels since
June 1. The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.8
percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
closed up 0.4 percent at 1,123.32.
 Oil prices surged almost $5 a barrel as the stronger labor
market data and decline in U.S. crude stockpiles supported
views of an economy in recovery.
 Stockpiles fell an unexpectedly high 3.2 million barrels
last week ahead of the long Independence Day weekend, data from
the American Petroleum Institute showed. The United States is
the world's largest energy consumer.
 Brent crude oil settled up more than 4 percent above $118
per barrel in London , its highest since May 9,
according to Reuters data. U.S. crude  finished up 2
percent at above $98 after rallying past $99 earlier.
 The euro was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at
$1.43490 , rebounding from a session low of around
$1.42, Reuters data showed.
 The euro zone single currency recouped losses against the
dollar as investors were encouraged by the ECB's decision to
suspend minimum credit rating requirements for Portugal's debt
despite the recent Moody's downgrade of its rating to junk.
 The ECB's decision to help Portugal ""has provided more
reassurance that European authorities will support the euro at
almost any cost,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""That has taken away
some of the uncertainty.""
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell as the encouraging jobs data
and the ECB's support for Portugal reduced worries about the
economy and sovereign fiscal problems in Europe.
 The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note  last
traded down 12/32 in price to yield near 3.16 percent, below
the six-week high of 3.22 percent set last week.
 Treasuries fared slightly better than German Bunds. The
10-year Treasury yield premium over 10-year Bunds shrank to
17.9 basis points from 18.8 on Wednesday.

 By Nia Williams and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Thursday,
failing to benefit from a widely expected interest rate rise by
the European Central Bank as investors speculated the bank may
signal a more dovish stance on policy for the coming months. 
 The euro slipped to a session low of $1.4251, down
0.4 percent on the day, after the ECB delivered a 25 basis point
rate rise to 1.50 percent. 
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will address reporters at
1230 GMT. Investors were on tenterhooks to see if he would
signal another rate rise this year in the face of inflation
risks, even as the euro zone suffers from debt problems while
economic growth remains patchy.	
 Traders said last-minute selling by large banks before the
rate decision had pressured the euro lower, while analysts said
investors were betting on more euro losses later in the day.	
 ""The market is still slightly short euros because there are
doubts also to whether the ECB can sustain its current rate
path,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS. 
 He said the ECB may not be able to keep its hawkish stance
on rates if economic growth slows in Germany, the bloc's
strongest nation.	
 Any indication the ECB will put its tightening cycle on hold
could repel investors buying the euro for its favourable rate
differentials versus the dollar, a key pillar of support for the
single currency beset by Greek debt problems.	
 ""People would use that as an opportunity to add to short
positions in the euro. The reaction to an ECB surprise is
typically about 100 pips so the euro could go down to $1.4200,""
said George Saravelos, FX strategist at Deutsche Bank.	
 Analysts will scrutinise Trichet comments for insight into
the ECB's policy outlook, with some offering hints on
deciphering his rhetoric.	
 ""If Trichet uses 'Monitor very closely' on inflation and
re-iterates that monetary policy is 'Very accommodative', this
should be interpreted as the next hike being not more than three
to four months away,"" Danske analysts said in a note.	
 ""(If he) steps up the rhetoric a bit more and says 'Very
close monitoring', thereby signalling that the next hike could
be only two to three months away, the market reaction will be
more significant,"" they added.	
 A ramp up in rhetoric could push the currency higher, they
said, as many in the market are currently pricing the next hike
in November or December. 
 But Danske analysts said any upside could be limited as
weekly data has shown speculators remain net long on the euro,
betting it will appreciate.	
 On the flipside, they said a reference to current policy as
""accommodative"" -- toning down the language from ""very
accommodative"" used recently -- would be considered as a dovish
stance, which may trigger euro selling.

 EURO RISKS	
 The euro was on the back foot versus other currencies,
hovering at a session low versus sterling of 89.25 pence
.	
 The euro traded at 1.2060 francs, up slightly on
the day, but it hovered in range of a lifetime low around 1.1800
hit late last month, as the safe-haven franc has benefited from
the flare up in sovereign debt concerns. 
 ""Our flow has been really mixed,"" a London trader said.
""It's going to be messy today but I'm selling any euro rally.""	
 The options market also indicated the risk of substantial
euro upside is limited by continuing concerns over peripheral
euro zone debt. 
 The euro zone debt crisis gained fresh legs this week after
ratings agency Moody's slashed its rating for Portugal to junk
status, fuelling worries that Greece's debt problems could
engulf other countries within the euro zone. 
 The issue has been weighing on the market and could add to
bearish sentiment on the euro if Trichet sticks to his line to
date and offers no sign of how a solution can be reached.	
 ""We have growing disparity between the underperforming
periphery and the largely resilient core of the euro zone. This
disparity is causing a dilemma for the ECB,"" said Citi analyst
Valentin Marinov. ""I suspect the euro will continue to
underperform other risk-correlated currencies as a result.""	
 The dollar was flat at 80.93 yen , staying within a
well-worn range roughly between 79.80 and 81.30. Against a
currency basket , the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 75.279.	
 Overall, the dollar has failed to gain significantly from
euro weakness as concerns about the United States' own budget
deficit praying on investors' minds.	
 U.S. non-farm payrolls for June are due on Friday and are
expected to have expanded modestly from May's weak figure but
remain low at around 110,000. 
 A second month of weak payrolls would point to a soft patch
in the U.S. economy and weigh on the greenback.	
Better-than-expected Australian employment data helped the
Australian dollar climb 0.3 percent on the day, while
the New Zealand dollar was flat at $0.8268, not far off
a 30-year peak of $0.8332 set this week.

 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Thursday
as investors looked beyond a well-flagged interest rate hike by
the European Central Bank to focus on the worsening euro zone
debt crisis, while world stocks held steady just below this
week's five-week high.	
 Concern that Greece's sovereign debt crisis would spread to
other highly indebted peripheral euro zone countries flared up
this week after Moody's slashed its rating for Portugal to junk
status. 
 The ECB hiked rates for the second time this year as
expected. Investors are awaiting a news conference by its
President Jean-Claude Trichet from 1230 GMT to see if the
central bank will stick to its hard-line stance that Greece must
not be allowed to default on its debts.	
 Reflecting the nervousness over the euro zone periphery, the
yield premium investors demand to hold 10-year Italian
government bonds rather than German Bunds hit a euro-era record.	
 ""What we're seeing now, much more than a year ago is that
there is a more serious contagion to the larger peripherals and
on the political side it is much less clear what Europe wants,
where Europe goes and how much cohesion there is,"" said Peter
Schaffrik, rate strategist at RBC Capital Markets. 
 The euro fell a quarter percent to $1.4278.	
 MSCI world equity index was steady on the
day while European stocks were up 0.3 percent.	
 Chinese stocks fell 0.6 percent after China raised
interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, making
clear that taming inflation remains a top priority even as the
growth pace of its vast economy gently eases. 
 Emerging stocks rose 0.2 percent. U.S. stock
futures were up around 0.3 percent , pointing to a firmer
open on Wall Street later.	
 ""Despite the rate hike from Beijing and ongoing concerns
over the euro zone debt situation, equity markets are continuing
to grind their way higher as we move towards the end of the
week,"" said Cameron Peacock, market analyst at IG Markets. 
 ""Arguably, there has been little fundamental direction
around so far -- neither economic or corporate news has been all
that high profile -- but ... the temptation to start booking
profits may well be seen."" 
 U.S. crude oil  rose 0.6 percent to $97.25 a barrel
after data showed U.S. crude stocks fell more than expected.	
 Bund futures  fell 9 ticks. Spreads 10-year Italian
BTP bonds and German Bunds widened to 224 basis points.	
 Greek creditors have gone back to the drawing board in an
attempt to thrash out a rollover plan for the country's debts
after Standard & Poor's said a French plan would likely result
in a ""selective default"" rating. 
 The dollar was steady against a basket of major
currencies.

 By Nia Williams	
 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday ahead
of an European Central Bank interest rate decision, hampered by
concerns over the euro zone debt crisis and vulnerable to the
risk the bank will decline to flag future rises.	
 The market has already factored in a 25 basis point rise at
the 1145 GMT rate decision, limiting upside potential for the
euro, and will watch closely to see whether ECB President
Trichet remains hawkish on inflation.	
 Any indication the ECB will put its tightening cycle on hold
could repel investors buying the euro for its favourable rate
differentials versus the dollar, a key pillar of support for the
single currency beset by Greek debt problems.	
 ""People would use that as an opportunity to add to short
positions in the euro. The reaction to an ECB surprise is
typically about 100 pips so the euro could go down to $1.4200,""
said George Saravelos, FX strategist at Deutsche Bank.	
 ""An interest rate hike is close to fully priced in. The
sell-off in European bond markets this week has been a bigger
driver in the last few days than rate differentials.""	
 The single currency last traded down 0.2 percent on the day
at $1.4293, coming under pressure from selling by macro funds
and Middle Eastern names after Moody's downgraded Portuguese
banks' government-guaranteed debt. 
 Traders said the market was short euros ahead of the ECB
decision - betting on further falls - with support around
$1.4280, the 61.8 percent retracement of the June 27 to July 4
rally. Upside stops are reported above $1.4370 and $1.4400 and
could become the target of any post-hike trading.	
 ""Our flow has been really mixed,"" a London trader said.
""It's going to be messy today but I'm selling any euro rally.""	
 The options market also indicated the risk of substantial
euro upside is limited by continuing concerns over peripheral
euro zone debt. 
 The crisis gained fresh legs this week after ratings agency
Moody's slashed its rating for Portugal to junk status, fuelling
worries that Greece's debt problems could engulf other countries
within the euro zone. 
 Trichet is likely to be questioned about the downgrade and
the ECB's willingness to accept private sector involvement in
Greek debt at the news conference following the rate decision.	
 Both issues have been weighing on investors' minds and could
add to bearish sentiment on the euro if Trichet sticks to his
line to date and offers no sign of how a solution can be
reached.	
 The latest bout of pressure on the periphery pushed Italian
bond spreads to their highest since Q4 2008. Many traders said
raising interest rates could add to peripheral funding costs,
potentially creating more problems for the euro.	
 ""We have growing disparity between the underperforming
periphery and the largely resilient core of the euro zone. This
disparity is causing a dilemma for the ECB,"" said Citi analyst
Valentin Marinov. ""I suspect the euro will continue to
underperform other risk-correlated currencies as a result.""	
 Safe-haven currency the Swiss franc benefited from
the flare up in sovereign debt concerns. The euro fell 0.2
percent to 1.2043 francs, holding above a record low of 1.1800
francs on June 24.	
 
 U.S. DATA FOCUS	
 The dollar was flat at 80.93 yen , staying within a
well-worn range roughly between 79.80 and 81.30. 
 Against a basket of currencies the dollar slipped 0.1
percent to 75.102, failing to benefit significantly from euro
zone woes, with concerns about the United States' own budget
deficit praying on investors' minds.	
 U.S. non-farm payrolls for June are due on Friday and are

remain low at around 110,000. 
 A second month of weak payrolls would point to a soft patch
in the U.S. economy and weigh on the greenback.	
 Commodity currencies fared surprisingly well in the face of
renewed pressure on the euro and a rise in China's interest
rates. Analysts suggested China's third hike this year was close
to, or even at the end, of its tightening cycle. 
Better-than-expected Australian employment data helped the
Australian dollar climb 0.4 percent to last stand near
$1.0733. The New Zealand dollar was flat at $0.8268,
was not far off a 30-year peak of $0.8332 set this week.

 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Thursday and
looked vulnerable to concerns over the euro zone's debt crisis
and the risk that the European Central Bank will decline to flag
future rises in interest rates later in the day.	
 The crisis gained fresh legs this week after ratings agency
Moody's slashed its rating for Portugal to junk status, fuelling
worries Greece's debt problems could engulf other countries

 ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet is likely to be questioned
about the downgrade at a news conference following the central

 The market has already factored in a 25 basis point rise on
Thursday, limiting further upside potential for the euro, but
will watch closely to see whether Trichet remains hawkish on
inflation and flags any further rate rises.	
 ""The rate hike is well priced in and the market has been
paring back a little bit of expectations of rate rises from the
ECB over the rest of the year,"" said Jane Foley, currency
strategist at Rabobank.	
 Trichet is also likely to be questioned about the ECB's
willingness to accept private sector involvement in
restructuring Greek debt, still an unresolved issue that is
weighing on investors minds.	
 ""On one hand you have support from the rate hike but unless
we get clarity from Trichet the euro is going to be softer. I
think we will go back to yesterday's lows,"" said Foley.	
 The single currency last traded down 0.1 percent on the day
at $1.4300, coming under pressure from selling by macro funds
and Middle Eastern names after Moody's also downgraded
Portuguese banks' government-guaranteed debt. 
 Traders said the market was short ahead of the ECB rate
decision, making it vulnerable to an initial squeeze, with
support around $1.4280, the 61.8 percent retracement of the June
27 to July 4 rally. 
 A break below that could see the single currency return to
$1.4213, the 76.4 percent level. On the upside stops are
reported above $1.4370 and $1.4400 and could become the target
of any post-hike trading.	
 The latest bout of pressure on the euro zone periphery
pushed Italian bond spreads to their highest since Q4 2008 and
many traders say raising interest rates could add to peripheral
funding costs, potentially creating more problems for the euro.	
 ""We have growing disparity between the underperforming

Valentin Marinov.	
 ""How they are going to deal with it is what investors will
be looking to find out from today's monetary policy meeting I
suspect the euro will continue to underperform other risk
correlated currencies as a result.""	
 Safe-haven currency the Swiss franc benefited from
the flare up in sovereign debt concerns. The euro fell 0.3
percent to 1.1984 francs, within sight of a record low of 1.1800
francs on June 24.	
 
 COMMODITY CURRENCY STRENGTH	
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 80.92 yen, staying
within a well-worn range roughly between 79.80 and 81.30. 
 Against a basket of currencies the dollar slipped 0.1
percent to 75.075, falling to benefit significantly from euro
zone woes, with concerns about the United States' own budget
deficit praying on investors' minds.	
 Currencies backed by strong commodities sectors fared
surprisingly well in the face of renewed pressure on the euro
and a rise in China's interest rates. Analysts suggested China's
third hike this year was close to, or even at the end, of its
tightening cycle. 
""While the euro is suffering on the back of such negative
news flow, unlike the 2010 episodes of euro zone debt woes, the
risk aversion impact appears to be getting increasingly narrow,""
said Peter Frank, strategist at Societe Generale. 
""Interestingly, even with the announcement of another China
policy rate hike, USD, JPY and CHF gains against the commodity
bloc currencies were marginal or non-existent,"" he added. 
The Australian dollar recovered from a dip to
one-week lows around $1.0655 to last stand near $1.0734 while
the New Zealand currency was at $0.8268, was not far
off a 30-year peak of $0.8332 set earlier this week. 
The Aussie extended its gains further after data showed
Australian employment rose by more than expected in June.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro stabilised in Asia
on Thursday but remained vulnerable as worries about Europe's
sovereign debt problems could take centre stage again after a
widely expected interest rate hike by the European Central Bank
later in the day.	
 Concern that Greece's debt crisis would spread to other
highly indebted peripheral euro zone countries flared up this
week after Moody's slashed its rating for Portugal to junk
status. 
 ""Ireland could get downgraded to junk status too,
which would hurt the euro. Countries like Spain and Italy have
relatively high ratings despite rises in their bond yields and
they could face more downgrades,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, forex
manager at State Street.	
 Yield spreads on Italian bonds over German bunds
have soared in recent weeks and many traders say the euro's
potential downside will look bigger if the ECB raises rates on
Thursday.	
 ""Now with euro peripheral contagion back in rage, the ECB
meeting is almost relegated to the status of a sideshow ... the
potential for Mr Trichet to do or say anything that will
immediately propel the euro significantly higher is considerably
diminished,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note. 
In fact, if anything, a softening in ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet's hawkish stance, or even a lack of more
hawkish comments, could further weigh on the euro, traders said.

 ""If Trichet's comments just underline expectations of
gradual tightening in the future, the market may be disappointed
and sell the euro, said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Trust Bank.	
 The euro was last at $1.4335 , having plumbed a trough
around $1.4286 overnight. Support is seen at the session low, a
level representing a 61.8 percent retracement of a June 27 to
July 4 rally. 
A break of that could see the single currency return to
$1.4213, the 76.4 percent level. A breach of its upward sloping
trendline support since late May, now at around $1.4175, could
add to bearish sentiment.	
 Still, analysts don't expect the euro to fall too sharply in
the months ahead, underpinned by higher interest rates, a
Reuters poll showed. 
Analysts in the survey see the euro at $1.3900 in a year's
time. See for the latest Reuters forex poll. 
Against the safe-haven Swiss franc , the euro
reached a low around 1.1958 francs on Wednesday before
recovering a bit to last stand at 1.2029. It was, however, not
far off a record low near 1.1800 set recently. 
The dollar benefited from the euro's woes, rising against a
basket of major currencies. The dollar index climbed to
around 75.000, pulling further away from a one-month low of
74.133 set earlier in the week. 
Against the yen, it was at 80.97 , staying in a
well-worn range roughly between 79.80 and 81.30. 
Commodity currencies fared surprisingly well in the face of
renewed pressure on the euro and China's interest rate hike. 
 
 TIGHTENING CYCLE	
 China raised rates for the third time this year, but
analysts suggested it was close to, or even at the end, of its
tightening cycle. There was also some optimism that it would not
be threatened by a hard landing. 
""While the euro is suffering on the back of such negative
news flow, unlike the 2010 episodes of euro zone debt woes, the
risk aversion impact appears to be getting increasingly narrow,""
noted Frank Peter, strategist at Societe Generale. 
""Interestingly, even with the announcement of another China
policy rate hike, USD, JPY and CHF gains against the commodity
bloc currencies were marginal or non-existent,"" he added. 
Indeed, the Australian dollar recovered from a dip
to one-week lows around $1.0655 to last stand near $1.0730,
while the New Zealand currency at $0.8262, was not far
off a 30-year peak of $0.8332 set earlier this week. 
The Aussie extended its gains further after data showed
Australian employment rose by more than expected in June.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Thursday
with a widely expected rate hike from the European Central Bank
later being offset by a spreading sovereign debt crisis, while
China's bank stocks bounced on hopes of a near-term pause in
policy tightening.	
 The risks of sovereign debt default were still very much on
the radar of global investors, though Wall Street finished
higher overnight, as many looked beyond the latest bout of
nervousness over the euro zone debt crisis after Moody's slash
in Portugal's ratings sparked a selloff in peripheral bonds.	
 The sharp drop in the bonds of Portugal and Greece came just
a week after Greece passed tough austerity measures needed to
win a near-term bailout, thereby avoiding a default.	
 Greece and Portugal have raised the stakes for ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet and keep exposing the euro's biggest
vulnerability. The central bank will probably lift rates for a
second time this year to 1.5 percent but then pause for a few
months as it battles a debt crisis and struggles to avoid an
outright default. 
 ""On a relative basis, Europe is going to be suffering with a
strong currency, higher interest rates, budget problems,
austerity budgets, higher taxation. So you're going to have low
growth in Europe,"" said Davis Hall, global head of FX and
precious metals advisory at Credit Agricole Suisse's private
client business.	
 ""Europe is going to need a weaker currency at some point...
Which is why we think the euro is vulnerable and we are staying
away,"" said Hall, who is bearish on the euro versus the Swiss
franc and U.S. dollar.	
 
 SAMSUNG UNLEASHES TECH SECTOR BEARS	
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.4 percent, near a one-month high
reached on Monday that has been difficult to retest since then. 
 Gains were spread evenly across the financials, industrials
and consumer-oriented stocks, while the technology sector was
the only one in the red, pulled down by a 2 percent fall in
shares of Samsung Electronics . 
 Quarterly profit at Samsung, the world's largest maker of
memory chips and televisions and a big favourite of foreign fund
managers wanting exposure to the Asian tech sector, fell 26
percent, hurt by weak earnings at its flat screen unit.

 Bank and insurer shares helped lead gains in Hong Kong as
investors judged that the People's Bank of China is getting
closer to taking a break from its multiple increases in policy
rates and bank reserve requirements as the economy shows signs
of losing steam. 
 ""For a speculative play you could say that Chinese banks
have been beaten down on various concerns ... but I don't think
those banks will go bust,"" Yonghao Pu, chief strategist of UBS
Wealth Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters Television. 
 ""Sentiment (on Chinese bank stocks) is very bad, but for the
short term I think you can speculate and buy some."" 
 The Hang Seng index rose 0.5 percent, while the Hang
Seng China Enterprises index of mainland stocks listed in Hong
Kong was up 0.7 percent .	
 Japan's Nikkei average closed down 0.1 percent,
ending a 7-day rally that pushed the index back to where it was
right after March's devastating earthquake and tsunami. 
 
 OPTIONS TO AVERT U.S. DEFAULT	
 The euro was trading at $1.4315 , smack in the middle
of a range held over the past two months. It could be vulnerable
should the ECB strike a dovish note later after a policy meeting
or if the debt crisis brings countries such as Greece and
Portugal closer to default.	
 However, with Congress still not close to agreeing to lift
the ceiling on government borrowing, the possibility of a U.S.
debt default has loomed over the dollar as well and helped to
keep the euro in a relatively tight trading range against the
dollar for the past few months.	
 Reflecting how critical the issue of U.S. debt ceiling has
become, top Treasury officials have been secretly exploring ways
to prevent a financial meltdown that would be triggered if
Washington was unable to pay its bills on time, sources told
Reuters. 
 The Australian dollar climbed 0.3 percent against the dollar
at $1.0732 after data showed a robust increase in June
employment showed the economy was holding up well despite recent
reports showing households becoming more cautious on spending.

 Gold prices were little changed at $1,532.60 an ounce
, while U.S. crude oil  was up 68 cents to $97.33 a
barrel.

 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Portugal's credit downgrade
pressured the euro and global stocks on Wednesday and China's
rate hike weighed on commodities, but Wall Street paid little
heed and pushed shares higher.
 Moody's downgrade of Portugal cast new doubt on European
efforts to rescue distressed euro zone states without debt
restructuring. For more, see: [ID:nL6E7I60XH] Portugal's
government bond yields hit lifetime highs, hammering the euro.
 China's central bank raised interest rates for the third
time this year [ID:nB9E7EM01R], making clear that taming
inflation is a top priority as its economy slows.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> settled
down almost half a percent [O/R] and U.S. crude oil , the
CRB's main component, fell a quarter percent. But gold, a safe
haven, rose 1 percent .
 U.S. stocks ended up, rebounding from a weak open.
Transportation shares were among the standouts in a session in
which volume was contained by falling bank stocks. [.N]
 ""Any time you are dealing with banking issues, there seems
to be a domino effect,"" said Steve Goldman, market strategist
at Weeden & Co.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> settled up 56.15
points, or 0.45 percent, at 12,626.02. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 1.34 points, or 0.10 percent, at
1,339.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> ended up 8.25
points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,834.02.
 The Dow Transports index <.DJT> hit an unofficial all-time
closing high at 5,565.90.
 ""There's new momentum in the market following last week's
surge, and generally speaking, the markets have an upward
bias,"" said Michael McGervey, president of McGervey Wealth
Management in North Canton, Ohio.
 ""But until we break through 1,345 (on the S&P 500), we'll
be trading sideways,"" he said, adding that there was further
upside potential if the level was breached.
 The euro  fell 0.7 percent on the day after
touching a one-week low below $1.43 and extending losses from
Tuesday. Its losses versus the dollar boosted the greenback 0.5
percent against a currency basket. [USD/]
 The euro's fall came as fears over Greece and Portugal
prompt investors to hunt for safer havens such as the Swiss
franc  and yen .
 ""Maybe we want a quick fix, maybe we are looking for one,
but there is no quick fix and if there is, I haven't heard it
yet,"" said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.
 Some investors were also shedding risky assets ahead of the
European Central Bank's monetary policy announcement on
Thursday.
 The ECB is all but guaranteed to raise interest rates by 25
basis points to 1.5 percent -- an encouraging development for
the euro -- although markets remain uncertain on the timing of
further rate moves by the central bank.
 The two-year yield on Portuguese government debt
 surged more than 2 percentage points to a lifetime
high of 15.77 percent, while the 10-year yield 
climbed more than 1 percentage point to 13.45 percent, also its
highest ever.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which tracks
global equities, and the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> for
European shares both closed down 0.3 percent.
 Markets showed little reaction to U.S. data on the service
sector reflecting a slight slowdown in growth in June,
according to the Institute for Supply Management.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
5/32, its yield at 3.1006 percent.

(Updates prices, adds details)
 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - The euro slid for a second
straight day against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday as a Chinese
interest rate hike raised global growth concerns in a market
already unnerved by the downgrade of Portugal's debt to junk.
 China raised rates for the third time this year, making
clear that taming inflation remains a top priority even as its
vast economy pauses. For details, see [ID:nL3E7FK17V]
 The news caused investors to cut exposure to stocks,
commodities and growth-linked currencies.
 Beijing's rate hike raised serious worries about the
sustainability of China's historic economic expansion, a key
engine of the broader global recovery, analysts said.
 ""The dollar stands to benefit from a further unwinding of
long positions in higher-yielding currencies, emerging market
assets and commodities,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 China's rate hike weighed on an already soft euro dogged by
renewed concerns of sovereign debt contagion after Moody's
downgraded Portuguese debt by four notches to Ba2, saying the
country may need a second round of official financing before it
can return to capital markets. [ID:nN1E764185]
 In mid afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.8
percent at $1.4311, the lowest since June 28 . The single
currency has lost 1.5 percent in the last two sessions at
current prices.
 Risk aversion also pushed the euro lower against the
safe-haven Swiss franc. It shed 0.8 percent to trade at 1.2031
francs .
 Investors sold the single currency after spreads of
Portuguese, Spanish and Italian government bond yields over
their German counterparts widened in European trade. Heightened
concerns about funding also caused Portuguese credit default
swaps to jump. [ID:nL6E7I60QB].
 Euro losses were checked by expectations for
quarter-percentage-point rate hike by the European Central Bank
on Thursday.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's news conference will be
closely watched for clues on the ongoing pace of the tightening
cycle.
 Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital
in Toronto, said she does not expect Trichet to reiterate the
expression ""strong vigilance"" in the news conference, but
expects him to continue to note inflationary pressures in
Europe and to remain modestly hawkish.
 ""Though this will be positive for the euro, sovereign
issues are likely to remain the key near-term driver,"" Sutton
said.
 The ECB uses the term ""strong vigilance"" when it wants to
communicate plans of tighter monetary policy.
 The dollar sustained losses against the yen after a report
showed sluggish growth in the U.S. services sector in June.
[ID:nEAPA60DMO]
 The dollar last traded down 0.2 percent at 80.91 yen
.
 The dollar could enjoy support if Friday's U.S. nonfarm
payrolls report suggests the U.S. economy is not doing as badly
as feared.
 A weak jobs number may cause some policymakers to consider
another round of stimulus.
 ""If nonfarm payrolls are strong, it will make the central
bank less worried about the outlook for the economy,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of global research and analysis at GFT
Forex in New York. ""But a few more months worth of payrolls
numbers would be needed before they feel comfortable about
tightening monetary policy more aggressively.""
 Employers likely added 90,000 job in June, up from 54,000
in May, while the unemployment rate likely held stready at 9.1
percent, according to a Reuters poll. [ECI/US]

 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Portugal's credit downgrade
pressured the euro on Wednesday, reigniting fresh fears about
euro zone debt just as concerns over Greece ebbed, while

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Portugal's credit downgrade to
""junk"" status rocked European markets on Wednesday, sending the
country's government bond yields to lifetime highs and hammering
the euro as it raised the spectre that Lisbon may be forced to
restructure its debt.	
 Risky assets took a beating and stayed under selling
pressure after China raised its official interest rate, stoking
some concerns that credit tightening in the world's No.2 economy
may dampen the outlook for the global economy.	
 European shares slipped, snapping a seven-day winning
streak, and U.S. stocks were poised to open lower a day after
Moody's warned Lisbon may need a second round of rescue funds
before it can return to capital markets. 
 Investors were already dumping risky assets ahead of a
monetary policy announcement by the European Central Bank on
Thursday.	
 The ECB is all but guaranteed to raise interest rates by 25
basis points to 1.5 percent, but markets remain uncertain
whether it will signal that further rates may be in store later
this year.	
 Markets also braced for U.S. payrolls data on Friday to see
if an expected rise in monthly employment will be enough to
convince investors that the U.S. economy is continuing to
recover.	
 Moody's rating cut for Portugal followed a Greek ratings
downgrade by S&P to near-default status last month, before
Athens managed to squeak through austerity measures which have
staved off a possible restructuring for the moment.	
 ""The key worry of the market is that the events that we've
seen with Greece are being repeated with Portugal,"" said WestLB
rate strategist Michael Leister. 
 The two-year yield on Portuguese government debt
surged more than 2 percentage points to a lifetime
high of 15.77 percent, while the 10-year yield
climbed more than 1 percentage point to 13.45 percent, also its
highest ever.	
 Other yields on bonds issued by weak, periphery euro zone
countries shot up, widening their spreads against German ones as
investors ploughed into the debt of the euro zone's strongest
member nation.	
 Such demand helped to push Bund futures  up 56 ticks
higher on the day to 126.18. 
 Some analysts downplayed the initial market reaction to
China's announcement it had increased interest rates for the
third time this year. 
 The Australian dollar , which is sensitive to
developments the Chinese economy due to Beijing's dependence on
its natural resources, slipped to a session low of A$1.0663
after the news, but trading just 0.2 percent lower on the day.	
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell 0.6 percent to a session
low around $96.25 per barrel on the news. 
 Analysts said that while the China rate move had been
flagged, they were surprised that the market's initial reaction
had not been bigger, as Beijing's attempt to tame inflation may
lead to a cut in global demand for goods.	
 ""There had been rumours earlier in the week of a rate rise
... There has been a slip in risk appetite since the
announcement, but the move has been exceedingly minor,"" said
Michael Derks, strategist at FXPro.	
 He added that European markets were firmly focussed on the
Portuguese downgrade, but said U.S. markets may show a bigger
reaction to China's rate rise later in the day.	
 European stocks slipped 0.4 percent to 1,117.56,
retreating from the highest level in more than a month hit the
previous day.	
 U.S. stock futures  fell 0.4 percent, an early
indication that U.S. shares may open lower.	
 The MSCI world equity index slipped 0.3
percent. The index has taken a breather after shooting up more
than 4 percent last week, its best performance in a year.	
 The euro slipped roughly half a percent on the day to
a session low around $1.4330, extending losses from the previous
day. Its losses versus the dollar prodded the greenback up 0.4
percent against a currency basket.	
 The euro took a beating across the board, as European
investors dumped the single currency for ones considered to be
safer havens, including the Swiss franc and the yen
.	
 ""Greece is a basket case and we will probably have Portugal
and Ireland drifting in the same boat,"" said Steve Barrow, head
of G10 currency research at Standard Bank. 
 ""But for the ECB raising rates, we would have the euro
falling pretty sharply. It is likely to hold in the $1.40-$1.50
range for now.""

 * Moody's downgrade of Portugal keeps alive contagion fears
 * Peripheral bond spreads widen, to keep euro under pressure
 * Euro bears wary ahead of ECB meeting, favour Swiss franc

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - The euro was under pressure on
Wednesday, losing ground against the dollar and the Swiss franc,
as peripheral euro zone debt worries and risks of a contagion
returned to investors' radar after Moody's slashed Portugal's
credit rating to junk.	
 Still, many expect losses to be checked as the market gears
up for a quarter percentage point rate hike by the European
Central Bank on Thursday. Add to that, the United States' own
struggles with its budget deficit and wrangling over ways to
raise the debt ceiling are likely to weigh on the dollar.	
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4370 as investors
sold the single currency after spreads of Portuguese, Spanish
and Italian government bond yields over their German
counterparts widened in European trade. .	
 Heightened concerns about funding concerns in Portugal are
likely to drive investors to sell the euro, which has near-term
support at $1.4330-- the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of
the its fall from a high of $1.4940 on May 4 to a low of around
$1.3970 on May 23.	
 ""Greece is a basket case and we will probably have Portugal
and Ireland drifting in the same boat,"" said Steve Barrow, head
of G10 currency research at Standard Bank. ""But for the ECB
raising rates, we would have the euro falling pretty sharply. It
is likely to hold in the $1.40-$1.50 range for now.""	
 Moody's cut Portugal's credit rating by four notches to Ba2,
saying there is great risk the country will need a second round
of official financing before it can return to capital markets.

 Despite the downgrade, the single currency was lifted by
stop-loss buying as well as broad weakness in the dollar in the
Asian session. The dollar fell prey to profit taking after
Tuesday's short squeeze with Asian central banks selling it
while hedge funds liquidated their bullish bets in dollar/yen.	
 Traders said that while a quarter percentage point rate hike
by the ECB was mostly priced in, the euro's near-term outlook
would depend on whether ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sounds
hawkish or not on Thursday.	
 Analysts said the euro could have a hard time eking out more
long-term gains versus the greenback if Friday's U.S. payrolls
data suggests the U.S. economy is not doing as badly as feared
and with yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries firmly
above 3 percent.	
 These views were echoed by Minoru Shioiri, forex manager at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.	
 ""The moves in euro/dollar will likely be determined by news
on the U.S. side rather than by the possible rate hike by the
ECB -- if payrolls are strong, we may see the euro edging
towards $1.40 long term,"" said Shioiri.	
 
 SAFE-HAVEN SWISSIE SHINES	
 Underscoring investors' nervousness ahead of the ECB meeting
and U.S. payrolls, the euro lost ground against the Swiss franc,
shedding 0.3 percent to trade at 1.2091 francs .
Traders said the break of support around 1.2180 francs triggered
more selling in a move that unwound about a third of last week's
4.3 percent rally.	
 The Swiss franc had risen to record highs against the euro
and the dollar late last month as edgy investors sought
the safe-haven currency amid worries about a Greek default and a
possible global slowdown. 
 While Portugal's downgrade reignited lingering fears about
other highly indebted peripheral euro zone countries, a broad
flight from risk was averted with stocks and commodities
advancing and the Australian and New Zealand dollars holding
steady. 
 The dollar softened versus the yen, shedding 0.2 percent to
trade at 80.93 yen , as hedge funds liquidated some of
their longs and exporters sold.	
 The pair continued to frustrate dealers as it kept trading
within the well-trodden range roughly between 79.80 and 81.30.	
 Meanwhile, commodity currencies like the Australian dollar
held up pretty well despite Portugal's downgrade. Talk of bids
from Asian central banks and local exporters around $1.0660/70
for the Aussie appeared to be providing a floor.	
 The Aussie was flat at $1.0695 , off Tuesday's
session low around $1.0664. It came under pressure in the
previous session following less upbeat comments from the Reserve
Bank of Australia.

 By Vikram Subhedar	
 HONG KONG, July 6 (Reuters) - Chinese banking shares fell
for a second day on Wednesday after a sovereign fund unloaded a
stake in two banks, flashing a cautious signal about risk even
after the euro clawed back losses endured on Moody's downgrade
of Portugal to junk status.	
 A rally in riskhy assets has stalled after a week, as
investors take a cautious stance ahead of a European Central
Bank meeting on Thursday, Friday's U.S. payrolls report and the
latest inflation and GDP data from China next week.	
 However, Japan's Nikkei stock index bucked the
trend, as investors scrambled to latch on to a 1.1 percent
climb, which lifted the market to the highest since the first
full trading day after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in
March. 
 The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index rose a modest
0.2 percent with weakness in financials largely offsetting gains
in materials and industrials.	
 Financials were led lower by a second day of
underperformance by China's banking sector, often considered a
proxy for the country's economy, after Singapore's Temasek, a
sovereign wealth fund, sold part of its stake in two of the
so-called ""Big Four"" Chinese banks.	
 Temasek sold a combined $3.6 billion worth of shares in Bank
of China and China Construction Bank sending
their shares down over 3 percent.	
 Financials, which carry the biggest weight by far as a
sector on Chinese bourses, pulled the Hang Seng down 0.4
percent and pushed the Shanghai Composite 0.7 percent
lower and further from Tuesday's six-week high.	
 Shanghai stocks had made a strong rebound over the past
fortnight, with the index rising 8 percent to a six-week high.
But that bounce has stalled on fresh fears about the impact of
China's local government debt on the sector. 
 ""Valuations-wise, we've probably seen the bottom but it's a
confidence issue right now,"" said Tom Kaan, a director at Louis
Capital Markets in Hong Kong.	
 The Temasek move comes a day after ratings agency Moody's
warned that its credit outlook on Chinese banks may turn
negative as China's local government debt may be understated by
as much 3.5 trillion yuan ($540 billion). 
 
 EURO STEADIES	
 The euro nudged higher after its steep overnight drop
following Moody's downgrade of Portugal's credit rating to junk
status reignited lingering fears about other highly indebted
peripheral euro zone countries. 
 Some economists think Ireland may also need more support and
worry Spain and Italy may be next in line for aid.	
 ""The Portugal news doesn't really change fundamentals.
That's why the market's reaction was limited to one day. If we
were talking about Spain, now that would be a totally different
story,"" said Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign exchange
research at Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 The euro rose 0.2 percent higher to $1.4460 after
dropping about a full cent to a low around $1.4395 on Tuesday
but analyst said the euro will have a hard time eking out more
long-term gains versus the greenback if Friday's U.S. payrolls
suggest the U.S. economy is not doing as badly as feared.	
 Spot gold hovered near a 1-1/2 week high as Moody's latest
move once again raised fears about highly indebted peripheral
euro zone countries. 
 ""While the market has moved on from Greece a little, there
is still significant concern out there that it's not close to
the end game,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 U.S. crude oil futures extended gains, rising 81 cents to
$97.70 a barrel , after earlier hitting the highest since
June 15, ahead of industry data that is expected to show a
decline in U.S. crude oil inventories.

(Updates prices throughout)	
 HONG KONG, July 6 (Reuters) - Chinese banking shares fell
for a second day on Wednesday, while the euro clawed back losses
but was still seen at risk after Moody's slashed Portugal's
credit rating to junk status, reigniting fears that it may need
a second rescue package.	
 A rally in riskier assets has stalled after the past week's
surge as investors take a cautious stance ahead of Friday's U.S.
payrolls report and the latest inflation and GDP data from China
next week.	
 Japan's Nikkei and the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index
were both up around 0.2 percent, but the Nikkei
was struggling to breach the 10,000 level despite gains in
commodity stocks that have helped drive the benchmark higher for
a seventh day.	
 China bank shares again underperformed the region after
Singapore state investor sold a combined $3.6 billion worth of
shares in Bank of China and China Construction Bank
to trim its exposure to the volatile financial
sector. 
 Bank of China fell 3.6 percent and CCB slumped nearly 3
percent in Hong Kong, helping pull the Hang Seng Index
down 0.3 percent and pushing the Shanghai Composite 0.8
percent into the red.	
 Shanghai stocks had made a strong rebound over the past
fortnight, with the index rising 8 percent to a six-week high.
But that bounce has stalled on fresh fears about the impact of
China's local government debt on the sector. 
 ""Valuations-wise, we've probably seen the bottom but it's a
confidence issue right now,"" said Tom Kaan, a director at Louis
Capital Markets in Hong Kong.	
 The Temasek move comes a day after ratings agency Moody's
warned that its credit outlook on Chinese banks may turn
negative as China's local government debt may be understated by
as much 3.5 trillion yuan ($540 billion). 
 Investors had another reason to step back from risky assets
after Moody's cut Portugal's credit rating by four notches on
Monday, saying there is great risk the country will need a
second round of official financing before it can return to
capital markets, even as the European Union haggles over the
shape of another rescue package for Greece.	
 Some economists think Ireland may also need more support and
worry Spain and Italy may be next in line for aid.	
 The euro was trading at 1.2128 against the Swiss franc
, well below Monday's high of 1.2349. 
 Against the dollar, the common currency recovered some
ground after dropping about a full cent to a low of around
$1.4395 after the Moody's downgrade of Portugal. It was
trading around $1.4456 in late morning trade in Asia on
Wednesday, slightly better than late New York levels.	
 The European Central Bank is widely expected to raise
interest rates on Thursday, which could limit the euro's
near-term losses, and is expected to show no sign of softening
its hard-line stance that Greece must not be allowed to default
on its debts. 
 
 GOLD BUOYED BY EUROPE CONTAGION FEARS	
 Spot gold hovered near a 1-1/2 week high as Moody's latest
move once again raised fears about highly indebted peripheral
euro zone countries. 
 ""While the market has moved on from Greece a little, there
is still significant concern out there that it's not close to
the end game,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 U.S. crude oil futures extended gains, rising 54 cents to
$97.43 a barrel, edging closer to a three-week intraday high
marked the previous day, as investors waited industry data that
is expected to show a decline in U.S. crude oil inventories.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped from
five-week highs on Tuesday and the euro tumbled broadly on
concerns about the global economic outlook and after a major
ratings agency downgraded Portugal to junk status.
 Oil prices jumped about 2 percent after Barclays Capital
raised its 2012 forecasts for crude oil, leading a broad rally
in commodity prices as bargain-hunters bought into oversold
markets.
 Media reports about a possible rate rise in China and a
Moody's report saying the scale of problem loans at local
governments in China may be much bigger than previously thought
dented demand for risky assets. For more, see [nL3E7I507Y]
 Adding to investor worries, a survey showed the euro zone's
dominant service sector slowed for a third straight month in
June, while Moody's Investors Service cut Portugal's credit
rating by four levels to Ba2, two notches into junk territory.
 Moody's said there is great risk the country will need a
second round of official financing before it can return to
capital markets. The news added to lingering worries about
Greece even as Athens narrowly averted a near-term default.
 ""The Portugal downgrade clearly is negative because as the
downgrades spread from the weakest to the weaker, the market is
now asking, 'If Portugal is downgraded, will Spain be next?'""
said Cary Leahey, economist and managing director at Decision
Economics in New York. ""It's symptomatic of the contagion
effects in the eurozone.""
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.3 percent after earlier hitting their
highest since June 1. The index has risen almost 5 percent
since January.
 On Wall Street, shares ended mostly lower. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> fell 12.90 points, or 0.10 percent,
to 12,569.87. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down
1.79 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,337.88. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> , however, gained 9.74 points, or 0.35 percent,
to 2,825.77, helped by strength in Netflix shares .
 Investors were cautious about taking on more risk after the
recent run-up in equities, when world stocks posted their best
weekly gain in a year last week. U.S. stocks had their best
week in two years last week, with the S&P up 5.6 percent.
 Volume is expected to remain low in the holiday-shortened
week, with all eyes on Friday's U.S. monthly jobs data. Markets
were closed on Monday for the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
 European stocks <.FTEU3> ended slightly higher at 1,122.23
points. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> fell 0.3 percent.
 The euro fell 0.8 percent to $1.4419 , after
hitting a session low of $1.4395 on Reuters data, snapping six
straight days of gains. It also tumbled 1.6 percent to 1.2128
Swiss francs .
 The downgrade on Portugal followed another setback for
Greece on Monday when ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned
it would treat a rollover of privately held Greek debt, now
being discussed, as a selective default. [ID:nL6E7I408N]
 Losses in the euro were limited by expectations the
European Central Bank would raise rates to 1.5 percent on
Thursday and likely signal more tightening.
 OIL, SAFE HAVENS SHINE
 ICE Brent futures for August  rose to a high of
$114.44 a barrel, the highest since June 22, before settling at
$113.61, gaining $2.22, or 1.99 percent. U.S. crude 
ended up $1.95, or 2.05 percent, at $96.89 per barrel.
 Barclays Capital raised its 2012 forecast for Brent by $10,
to $115 per barrel, and upgraded its 2012 forecast for U.S.
crude by $4, to $110. The bank said it expects a further
reduction in global spare capacity in 2012, together with a
significant intensification of the geopolitical background.
 Commodities rallied broadly in spite of a stronger dollar
and weaker stocks, extending their rebound from a nearly
six-month low as investors bet the sell-off in the second
quarter -- when the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> dropped
6 percent, the biggest fall since late 2008 -- was overdone.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1,514.66 an ounce, against
$1,495.54 late in New York on Monday.
 ""We may be seeing some running to commodities as a safe
haven. When in doubt about all the currencies, move into
commodities. And the sector was a little oversold coming out of
the holiday,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in
Chicago.
 Jitters over euro zone peripheral economies pushed
safe-haven U.S. government debt prices higher and helped put on
the back burner, for now, concerns over the risk of a possible
U.S. default. The benchmark 10-year note  was up
14/32 for a yield of 3.13 percent.

 NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped from

 SAFE-HAVEN ASSETS IN DEMAND

for safe-haven assets such as the Swiss franc, gold and U.S.
government bonds.
 The euro earlier dropped 1 percent to a low of 1.22059
Swiss francs , retreating from a five-week high hit
on Monday. It was last down 0.8 percent at 1.2227 francs.

ministers of a 12 billion euro loan.
 Greece suffered another setback on Monday after Standard &
Poor's warned it would treat a possible rollover of privately

billion euros, which euro zone finance ministers said would be
finalized by mid-September.
 Against the dollar, the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.4474
, after gaining more than 2 percent last week in its
best weekly rise since January.
 Losses in the euro were limited by expectations the
European Central Bank would raise rates to 1.5 percent on
Thursday and signal more tightening.
 But Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT
in New York, said the latest data from the region suggests that
""growth has slowed significantly"" and may force the ECB to
re-evaluate any further tightening for the rest of the year.
 Jitters over Greece pushed U.S. government debt prices
higher and helped put on the back burner, for now, concerns
over the risk of a possible U.S. default. The benchmark 10-year
note  was up 8/32 for a yield of 3.15 percent.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1,511.69 an ounce, against

(Updates prices, adds quote)
 NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - The euro slid against the
dollar and the Swiss franc on Tuesday, snapping six straight
days of gains as weak euro zone data and concerns on China
weighed on risk sentiment and boosted safe-haven currencies.
 Worries about Greece have not totally faded, despite the
approval by euro zone finance ministers of a 12 billion-euro
loan that will help it avert an immediate default. However, the
euro's losses are likely capped before Thursday's meeting of
the European Central Bank.
 The ECB is expected to hike interest rates, and any signal
that the ECB would tighten again this year would further
support the euro.
 ""The euro gave up its gains from last week. There is some
risk aversion in the market due to some soft euro zone PMI and
retail sales data,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""Greece is totally not out of the picture as well, and
there is also the possibility that China may raise rates.""
 Greece suffered a setback on Monday after credit rating
agency Standard & Poor's warned it would treat a rollover of
privately held Greek debt, now being discussed, as a selective
default. For details, see [ID:nL6E7I408N]
 Greece also needs a second aid package worth some 110
billion euros, which euro zone finance ministers said would be
made final by mid-September.
 The euro earlier dropped 1 percent against the safe-haven
Swiss franc  to a low of 1.22059 francs, pulling
back from a five-week high touched on Monday on trading
platform EBS. It was last down 0.8 percent at 1.22280, with
stops cited below 1.22 francs.
 The euro was down around 0.5 percent against the dollar at
$1.44719  on EBS, taking a breather from recent gains
made after Greece approved tough austerity measures last week.
The euro had gained more than 2 percent against the greenback
last week in its best weekly performance since January.
 On Monday the euro hit a one-month high versus the dollar
at $1.45800.
 Traders cited talk of stops through $1.44400-$1.44500 ahead
of bids $1.44300/$1.44350.
 Falls in the euro accelerated after the Markit Eurozone
Purchasing Managers' Index showed growth in the euro zone's
dominant services sector slowed to its weakest pace since
October. Euro zone retail sales data was also lower than
forecast, all of which tempered investor appetite for riskier
currencies. [ID:nL9E7I4005] [ID:nLDE7640H3]
 Investors, however, were unlikely to push the euro lower
before Thursday's ECB policy meeting, An ECB rate increase has
been well factored in by the market, analysts said.
 Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities
in Toronto, said the extent to which the German/U.S. spreads
can improve further hinges on the language that ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet uses at his post-meeting news conference,
with investors focused on what he says about inflation.
 ""Dropping the reference to 'strong vigilance' would signal
a short pause at least in the tightening cycle and likely see
the euro rally fade again,"" he said.
 Earlier, Chinese media reports about a possible rate rise
in China this weekend and a report by rating agency Moody's
saying the scale of problem loans to local governments in China
may be much bigger than previously thought also hurt risk
appetite, lifting the dollar as well. [ID:nL3E7I507Y]
 The ICE dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, bounced off
Monday's near one-month lows to trade at 74.869, up 0.3
percent.
 The U.S. dollar also received additional overall support
against the Australian dollar after the Reserve Bank of
Australia kept its key cash rate unchanged at 4.75 percent,
citing sluggishness in the economy outside the booming mining
sector.
 The Aussie dollar slipped below its 55-day moving average
to as low as US$1.0664 , its lowest since June 29,
before recovering to US$1.0706, down 0.4 percent for the day.

 NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - World stocks fell from
five-week highs on Tuesday, while the euro dropped broadly as
concerns about further monetary tightening in China and soft
euro-zone economic data made investors cautious.
 Oil jumped more than $1 per barrel after Barclays Capital
raised its 2012 forecasts for crude oil, outweighing worries
over the global economy.

their best week in two years last week.
 ""The market certainly could be headed for some sort of a
pullback. We've had a strong performance over the past week and
any slight disappointment would invite some profit-taking,""
said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners
in New York.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.2 percent on the day after earlier
hitting their highest since June 1. The index has risen almost
5 percent since January.
 U.S. stocks were little changed. At noon (1600 GMT), the

 In the oil market, ICE Brent futures for August 
rose to a high of $113.47 before easing back to around $113.26,
up $1.87. U.S. crude  was up $1.82 at $96.77 per barrel.
 Barclays Capital raised its 2012 forecast for Brent by $10,
to $115 per barrel, and upgraded its 2012 forecast for U.S.
crude by $4, to $110.
 ""The increase in expectations is due to a forecast further
reduction in global spare capacity in 2012, together with a
significant intensification of the geopolitical background to
the oil market,"" Barclays Capital said.
 SAFE-HAVEN ASSETS IN DEMAND
 Concerns about China and the global economy boosted demand
for safe-haven assets such as the Swiss franc, gold and U.S.
government bonds.

McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 Losses in the euro were limited by expectations the
European Central Bank would raise rates to 1.5 percent on
Thursday and signal more tightening.
 U.S. government debt prices rose as concerns over Chinese
banks' credit-worthiness and weaker U.S. stocks also revived
safety bids. The benchmark 10-year note  was last up
9/32 for a yield of 3.15 percent, down 3 basis points from
Friday.

 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - World stocks steadied below this
week's 4-1/2 week high on Tuesday while the euro fell as worries
about further monetary tightening in China and uncertainty over
the euro zone and U.S. economic outlook made investors cautious.	
 Speculation about a possible rate rise in China this weekend
curbed a pick-up in demand for risky assets since last week as
did a Moody's report saying the scale of problem loans at local
governments in China may be much bigger than previously thought.

 In the euro zone, a survey showed growth in the region's
dominant service sector slowed for a third straight month in
June, and by more than an initial estimate, with sluggish new
orders dimming the outlook. 
 Investors were also waiting to see more evidence the U.S.
economic recovery is gaining momentum before taking on more
risks, especially after world stocks, measured by MSCI, posted
their best weekly gain in a year last week.	
 ""Part of the reason for the rally last week was
better-than-expected data out of the United States. The markets
want to see whether that will continue and whether the soft
patch has come to an end,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist
at Charles Stanley. 
 ""There is still plenty of reason for most investors to be
strategically cautious.""	
 The MSCI world equity index was down
slightly on the day, after hitting its highest since June 1 on
Monday. The index has risen almost 5 percent since January.	
 European stocks rose 0.1 percent while emerging
stocks briefly hit a one-month high. U.S. stock
futures pointed to a slightly firmer open on Wall Street 
which reopens later after the Independence Day holiday on
Monday.	
 U.S. crude oil  fell 0.2 percent to $94.75 a barrel,
in part hurt by the dollar which rose 0.3 percent against a
basket of major currencies .	
 German government bond futures  rose 20 ticks.	
 
 EURO FALLS	
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.4472 after hitting a
one-month high near $1.4580 on Monday.	
 The single currency rose more than 2 percent last week,
posting its best weekly performance since January. It suffered a
brief setback on Monday after Standard & Poor's warned it would
treat a rollover of privately held Greek sovereign debt now
being discussed as a selective default. 
 S&P's warning came after Greece secured a 12 billion euro
loan that will prevent it defaulting in mid-July or August. But
the focus is on a second assistance package likely to be about
the same size as last year's 110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout.	
 Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told Reuters on
Monday the country would stave off default not only for its own
sake but because its survival is vital for the euro zone and the
global economy. 
 The euro's downside was limited thanks to expectations the
European Central Bank would raise rates to 1.5 percent on
Thursday and signal more tightening. 
 ""We expect the ECB to deliver additional hikes in October
2011 and January 2012, bringing the refinancing rate to 2
percent. The ECB is then likely to take a pause as inflation
comes down and headwind from fiscal tightening intensifies,""
Danske Bank said in a note to clients. 
 ""The realisation of the rate hike and a more hawkish tone
than generally expected should lift rates and result in
euro/dollar strengthening.""

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - The euro retreated against the
dollar and the Swiss franc on Tuesday as soft euro zone data and
concerns over the health of the Chinese economy pushed investors
away from riskier currencies back towards those perceived to
offer safety.	
 Safe-haven German Bunds rose on continued uncertainty over
plans to roll over Greek debt, keeping alive the risk of
contagion while fresh data showed growth in the euro zone's
dominant services sector slowing to its weakest pace since
October.	
 Euro zone retail sales data was also weaker than forecast,
all of which tempered investor appetite for riskier
currencies. .	
 ""The rally in risk over the past few days has run its course
and better data is needed to sustain it,"" said Gavin Friend,
currency strategist at nabgroup. 
 ""Euro zone data this morning has been less than encouraging,
while there are still plenty of hurdles for Greece to get over,""
he added.	
 The euro shed 1 percent against the safe-haven Swiss franc
to a low of 1.22059 francs, pulling back from a
five-week high hit on Monday of 1.2346 on trading platform EBS.
It was last down at 1.2234, with stops cited below 1.2200
francs.	
 The common currency was down around 0.5 percent against the
dollar at $1.4466 , taking a breather from recent gains
made after Greece approved tough austerity measures last week.	
 The common currency rallied over 2 percent against the
greenback last week in its best weekly performance since
January. It suffered a setback on Monday after credit rating
agency Standard & Poor's warned it would treat a rollover of
privately held Greek debt now being discussed as a selective
default. 
 S&P's warning came after euro zone finance ministers
approved a 12 billion euro loan for Greece, which it needs to
avert immediate default. However, it still needs a second aid
package worth some 110 billion euros, which euro zone finance
ministers said would be finalised by mid-September.	
 Market players said the euro would be supported if the
European Central Bank (ECB) raises interest rates as expected on
Thursday and signals more tightening to come. 
 Traders highlighted support at the top of the euro's
Ichimoku cloud, coming in around $1.4454 on Tuesday, while the
$1.4430 area was said to be pivotal.	
 
 CHINA BANK WORRIES	
 UBS said in a note that while sentiment for the euro had
improved somewhat, there was still a lack of details about
private sector involvement and heightened uncertainty about
rating agencies' reaction to the Greek debt rollover plan.	
 As such, it advised investors to sell the euro/Swiss pair on
any rally.	
 ""We could hit new lows over the next four weeks to three
months,"" said UBS strategist Manuel Oliveri. ""The general
assumption is that it remains on a downside trend and we are
seeing short positioning from hedge funds.""	
 Earlier, Chinese media reports about a possible rate rise
in China this weekend, as well as a report by rating agency
Moody's saying the scale of problem loans to local governments
in China may be much bigger than previously thought, weighed on
risk appetite. 
 ""Heightened negative sentiment over China's growth outlook
following Moody's raising concerns over the Chinese banking
sector has contributed to an overall pick-up in risk aversion,
which has helped the dollar pick up a bid,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.	
 ""There's also increasing speculation over a second U.S.
Homeland Investment Act developing. The first HIA in 2004
provided quite a boost for the dollar,"" he added.	
 Under the initial HIA, U.S. companies earning profits
overseas received a significant tax break by repatriating the
money back to the United States.	
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, bounced off
one-month lows to trade at 74.491, up 0.3 percent.	
 But with legislation for a second HIA still in the works and
escalating concerns over the U.S. fiscal situation, the dollar's
gains could be capped.	
 The dollar received additional overall support from its
advance against the Aussie after the Reserve Bank of Australia
kept its key cash rate unchanged at 4.75 percent, citing
sluggishness in the economy outside the booming mining sector.	
 The Aussie slipped below its 55-day moving average to as low
as $1.0664 , its lowest since June 29, before recovering
to $1.0700, down 0.3 percent for the day.	
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.5 percent to 81.13
but stayed stuck in its 79.80-81.30 yen range of the past few
weeks.

worries about further monetary tightening in China and caution
over the euro zone and U.S. economic outlook made investors

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, July 5 (Reuters) - The euro looked set to snap a
six-day winning streak on Tuesday, coming off nearly one-month
highs against the dollar as the greenback was bought back
broadly on a flurry of stop-loss buying and short-covering by
macro-funds.	
 Some traders cited talk that U.S. companies such as Pfizer
could repatriate dollars earned overseas to take
advantage of a proposed U.S. tax break as helping to push the
euro below $1.4500.	
 Chinese media reports about a possible rate rise in China
this weekend, as well as a Moody's report saying the scale of
problem loans at local governments in China may be much bigger
than previously thought, also weighed on risk appetite and
supported the dollar, they said.	
 The dollar received additional overall support from its
advance against the Aussie after the Reserve Bank of Australia
kept its key cash rate unchanged at 4.75 percent, citing
sluggishness in the economy outside the booming mining sector.	
 The Aussie slipped below its 55-day moving average to as low
as $1.0664 , its lowest since June 29. The Aussie was
down 0.7 percent at $1.0674 by late Asian trade.	
 ""The dollar was bought broadly. Speculation over possible
repatriation by U.S. corporations and the dollar's firmness
against the Australian dollar after the RBA's decision helped
it,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and forex research
at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo.	
 ""The dollar is being bought back on a correction, but the
underlying trend still hasn't changed as the dollar could come
under renewed selling pressure once the current corrective
buying is completed,"" Sasaki said.	
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4478. It hit an Asian
session low of $1.4465 after stops were taken out around
$1.4480. Analysts say $1.4430-50 will be a crucial support area.	
 The common currency rallied 2.5 percent last week in its
best weekly performance since January. It suffered a brief
setback on Monday after Standard & Poor's warned it would treat
a rollover of privately held Greek debt now being discussed as a
selective default. 
 S&P's warning came after Greece secured a 12 billion euro
loan to avert immediate default. However, it still needs a
second aid package worth some 120 billion euros, which euro zone
finance ministers said a would be finalised by mid-September.	
 Market players said the euro will likely rebound to
consolidate around $1.4500 for a possible retest of the June
peak near $1.4700, particularly if the European Central Bank
(ECB) raises rates on Thursday and signals more tightening.	
 ""It's hard to sell the euro aggressively before the ECB
meeting, as the ECB is still likely to do more tightening after
the July hike with the RBA seen standing pat for now. There will
be bids below $1.45,"" said a trader for a Japanese bank.	
 
 DOLLAR REBOUNDS 
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, bounced off
one-month lows to trade at 74.493, up 0.3 percent from Monday's
trough of 74.133.	
 Still, many players remain bearish about the dollar's
prospects.	
 HSBC analysts warned that sentiment for the dollar could
deteriorate further as the market focus shifts from Greece to
the U.S. debt ceiling. Congress has until Aug. 2 to approve new
borrowing and avoid a default. 
 ""During the recent Greek crisis EUR-USD barely broke 1.40
(low 1.3971), and our big concern is that if the market's focus
shifts intensely to the U.S. debt problem then the USD could
come under severe pressure,"" the analysts wrote in a report.	
 ""With this in the market's mind, we expect the market will
try to sell the USD until the debt ceiling issue is resolved.""	
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 81.05
but stayed stuck in its 79.80-81.30 yen range of the past few
weeks.	
 The dollar rose as far as 81.12 yen but met offers from
Japanese exporters and profit-taking by retail investors,
traders said.	
 Among commodity currencies, the New Zealand dollar bounded
to its highest since 1981 as bulls drove it through a big
buy-stop level, before it slipped into negative territory on the
U.S. currency's broad gains.	
 The kiwi spiked to around $0.8332, helped in part
by an upbeat survey of business confidence, before slipping to
around $0.8288 .

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose from the
day's lows on a broad bout of short covering on Tuesday while
Asian stocks pulled back slightly from a one-month high as some
investors took profits from their recent rally.	
 Foollowing a late dip in Asian equities, European markets
were set to open flat to marginally weaker before euro zone
services PMI and retail sales data. 
 A pick up in demand for risky assets from last week softened
a bit on some speculation about a possible rate rise in China
this weekend, as well as a Moody's report saying the scale of
problem loans at local governments in China may be much bigger
than previously thought. 
The Australian dollar languished near the day's lows after
the central bank bank held interest rates at 4.75 percent, as
widely expected, and said the economy was unlikely to grow as
strongly in 2011 as it first thought, supporting market bets
that rates could be on hold for a while longer. 
The RBA's dovish comments led to a short squeeze in the U.S.
dollar which scored chunky gains against the high-yielding
Australian dollar and the euro in the run up to
the Australian rate decision which was along expected lines.	
 ""It's a classic short squeeze in the dollar, but I don't
think the recent 'risk-on' trend has changed because of this
sharp move,"" said Tsutomu Soma, a senior manager at Okasan
Securities. 
""Both the Aussie and euro were overbought, so many players
simply wanted to lock in profits made on those rallies,"" Soma
said. 
 After the decision, the Aussie held near the day's lows of
1.0673, but still retained a large chunk of its 3 percent gains
earned since last week.	
 The euro turned lower on the day at $1.4472, though
it still held within striking distance of a one-month high
against the U.S. dollar before a much expected interest rate
increase on Thursday where a hawkish European Central Bank might
attract more buyers to the beleaguered currency.	
 With Greek default fears also being relegated to
the back burner for now, BNP Paribas strategists expect more
real money investors and leveraged accounts to start buying
euros if it becomes clear that any dips won't stay much below
the $1.45 line. 
 
 MODERATE SLOWDOWN	
 The RBA's accompanying statement bolstered expectations for
a moderate slowdown in Asia, rather than a hard landing, that
will bring inflation rates down has been attracting capital
inflows and increasing bets on a second-half recovery in stocks.	
 Some markets though, particularly Japan, may be ripe for
some profit-taking after jumping 4 percent in five sessions.	
 Risky assets have been slapped around in the first half of
the year by concerns ranging from worries about escalating
inflation in Asia, Japan's nuclear scare to surging commodity
prices and the impact of the end of U.S. quantitative easing.	
 China's shares , which have been at the vanguard of
the latest rally in regional equities, dipped after rating
agency Moody's said its local government debt burden may be 3.5
trillion yuan ($540 billion) larger than auditors estimated,
putting banks on the hook for deeper losses. 
 Stock markets in Australia and Japan edged
lower while the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
dipped 0.3 percent, moving further away from a
June 2 peak.	
 The index has been in a rising trend for the past two weeks.
 
 Asian currencies rose after the People's Bank of China fixed
the yuan's mid-point at a record high for the second
consecutive day on Tuesday at 6.4650 against the dollar.	
 Government bond markets were fairly quiet with yields on
ten-year U.S. Treasury notes edging lower to 3.16
percent, a rise of nearly 30 basis points since last Monday.	
 In credit markets, the Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment grade
index widened three basis points to 109-110 bps
from early trade.	
 U.S. crude futures  stayed close to the $95 per barrel
line ahead of U.S. factory orders data later in the day.	
 Spot gold held steady near the $1,500 per ounce line
while three-month copper contracts on the London Metal Exchange
hugged the $9,425 a tonne line.

 LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - The euro eased from one-month
highs against the dollar after Standard & Poor's said a debt
rollover plan could put Greece into selective default, though
expectations for a second Greek bailout kept it underpinned.
 The euro had hit a one-month high of $1.4580 earlier on
Monday, as near-term worries that Greece may default and
contagion risks eased. 
 On Saturday, euro zone finance ministers approved a 12
billion euro loan that Greece needed to avert default, but the
country still needs another rescue package expected to total
around 110 billion euros.
 Euro zone officials are working on how private creditors can
be involved voluntarily with French banks putting in place
proposals to rollover the bonds when they fall due. 
 S&P's latest salvo served as a reminder to investors that
the common currency's recovery would be at best rocky.
[ID:nL3E7I40H3]
 ""The French proposal is certainly raising a lot of interest
in the market and the S&P's comment that it still constitutes a
technical default does not really help the euro,"" said Audrey
Childe-Freeman, EMEA head of currency strategy at JP Morgan
Private Bank.
 The euro staged a relief rally after the Greek parliament
approved austerity and reform measures last week, and has also
drawn support from expectations that the European Central Bank
will raise interest rates at a policy meeting laterb this week.
 The euro  dropped from around $1.4550 to as low as
$1.4510 immediately after the S&P comments. [ID:nWNA2782]
 It traded with slight losses at $1.4504 into the European
afternoon, having risen to $1.4580 on trading platform EBS, its
highest since early June. Volumes were on the lower side with
U.S. markets shut for the Independence Day holiday.
 ""There is still a significant amount of uncertainty
surrounding the euro and Greece but investors do believe that a
second bailout will be announced. Market consensus seems to be
that things will work out positively and the euro will do
alright,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency analyst at Barclays
Capital.
 The euro failed to make a sustained break above resistance
at $1.4570, the 61.8 percent retracement of its fall from a
May 4 high of $1.4940 to a low of $1.3970 on May 23.
 It rallied 3 percent from last Monday's trough of around
$1.4100 as speculators added to long positions in the euro in
the week to June 28, data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed. [IMM/FX].
 Traders cited offers from a major Asian sovereign account at
$1.4580/90, protecting an option barrier at $1.4600.
 
 INVESTOR CAUTION
 In the options market, euro/dollar risk reversals continue
to come back in, with the one-month  now trading
around 2.05 in favour of euro puts, versus 2.15 on Friday, but
the investors remained cautious.
 ""Risk-reversals are trading quite negatively which shows
investors are still concerned about a low probability,
high-impact downside risk for the euro,"" said Subbarao.
 The euro was firmer against the safe-haven Swiss franc
 as investors continued to unwind long positions built
in the franc ahead of the Greek vote last week.
 The euro hit a five-week high of 1.2346 francs, stalling
near resistance around 1.2350, the 38.2 percent retracement of
the fall from 1.3244 to record lows of around 1.1800 hit last
month.
 Meanwhile, the dollar index <.DXY> was flat at 74.363, not
far from a near one-month low of 74.133. A slew of U.S. economic
data could sway sentiment this week, namely ADP private payrolls
data on Wednesday and the U.S. Labour Department's non-farm
payrolls report on Friday.
 Data from the U.S. has been mixed, lending little support to
the greenback, despite the Federal Reserve's $600 billion
quantitative easing programme coming to an end on June 30. The
end of the programme was expected to help the dollar, but the
country's own fiscal problems meant investors would remain wary.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 80.67 yen  with
offers from Japanese exporters cited above 81 yen.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, July 4 (Reuters) - The euro pared its gains
against the dollar on Monday and pulled back from a one-month
high after Standard & Poor's said a debt rollover plan being
considered for Greece may put the country into selective
default.	
 The euro had hit a one-month high of $1.4580 earlier on
Monday, buoyed by diminished worries over the risk that Greece
may default in the short-term, with stop-loss buying adding to
its rise.	
 But the announcement by S&P poured some cold water on the
euro's rally, which has also drawn support from market
expectations that the European Central Bank will raise interest
rates at a policy meeting later this week.	
 ""The euro is being sold on the news about Greece... But for
now I think it's more of a knee-jerk reaction,"" said a trader
for a Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 ""Whatever you may call it, the fact is that the Greeks
earned themselves some time,"" the trader said.	
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent from late U.S. trading on
Friday to $1.4538 . It fell from around $1.4550 to as low
as $1.4510 after the S&P comments. 
 Earlier on Monday, it had risen as high as $1.4580 on
trading platform EBS, its highest since early June.	
 One reason behind the recent optimism related to Greece's
problems was the expectation that a second rescue scheme for
Greece in which private sector investors bear some of the burden
would come together, said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist
Japan for Barclays Capital in Tokyo.	
 ""It looked like that was going to work, but this casts some
doubts about that,"" Yamamoto said, referring to the S&P's
announcement.	
 Still, the issue of private sector involvement and a
possible debt rollover has to do with a second aid package for
Greece that is due to be finalised in the next few months, and
in the meantime, falls in the euro could be limited ahead of
this week's ECB meeting, Yamamoto said.	
 Euro zone finance ministers on Saturday approved a 12
billion euro instalment of Greece's bailout and said details of
a second aid package for Athens would be finalised by
mid-September. 
 However, they signalled that Greece must expect significant
losses of sovereignty and jobs. As well, whether Athens can
successfully implement the reforms demanded by international
lenders remains to be seen. All of which means the euro's path
higher will be strewn with obstacles.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, July 4 (Reuters) - Asian equities climbed a fifth
consecutive session on Monday, led by Chinese stocks, though the
euro turned lower after ratings agency S&P warned that any
rollover of Greek's debt would constitute a default.	
 After two weeks of gains, equities were on a
strong footing as fears eased about a sharp slowdown in emerging
market giants such as China and a drop in commodity prices like
oil boosted demand for risky assets after a rocky first half.	
 One trader at a Hong Kong-based brokerage said long-only
buyers were stepping back into the market, signalling a shift
from the prior quarter where institutions were largely on the
sidelines and trading volumes on major exchanges stayed anemic. 
 The Shanghai composite index, which is still down
year-to-date, rose 1.6 percent on Monday after data last
week showed China's manufacturing growth moderated in June,
raising expectations that the economy may not be heading into a
sharp slowdown due to excessive tight monetary
policy. 
 A U.S.-based macro fund was also spotted buying into Chinese
banks - a sector often considered a proxy for the economy and
one which has a large enough weighting to lift the broader
market. 
 The China Enterprises index of top mainland firms
listed in Hong Kong, the most common way for foreign investors
to invest in China, rose 2.2 percent.	
 ""There has been a significant multiple contraction in PE
(price-earnings) terms which means that market (China) is
emblematic of the overall cheapness of the region,"" said
Jonathan Garner, head of global emerging markets strategy at
Morgan Stanley.	
 ""So we do expect China to do better both in absolute and
relative terms in the second half,"" he said, adding that the
bank is overweight on the materials, energy and financial
sectors. 
 Though headline PMI data dipped, underlying investment
trends remain strong and inflation is set to ease in the second
half following a moderation in economic activity, Merrill Lynch
strategists said.	
 They expect the Chinese economy to grow by more than 9
percent in 2011 -- much higher than a so-called ""hard landing""
scenario growth of around 7 percent.	
 Offering yet another ray of optimism for cautious-minded
investors was a batch of U.S. manufacturing data that suggested
the world's biggest economy may be recovering strongly from a
recent spell of weakness. 
 Japan's Nikkei ended up one percent, briefly rising
above 10,000 points level for the first time in two months,
while Australian stocks gained 0.4 percent.	
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 1.2 percent, touching its highest level
since early June, adding to two consecutive weeks of gains.	
 In Thailand, the baht strengthened and local shares
gained more than 4 percent after the clear majority
obtained by the Puea Thai party suggested that possibility of
post-election instability looked less likely in the short-term.
 
 Flows data painted a cheery picture. EPFR
Global-tracked Emerging Markets Equity Funds snapped a three
week outflow streak heading into July with Asia ex-Japan and the
diversified Global Emerging Markets (GEM) Equity Funds both
taking in over $1 billion while outflows from high yield bond
funds slowed. 
 U.S. markets are shut on Monday for a holiday.	
 
 EURO WEAKENS	
 The euro erased early gains and held near the day's
lows after ratings agency S&P said a debt rollover plan may put
Greece in a selective default. The single currency had reached a
one-month high of $1.4580 earlier in the day 
 Moreover, even though the latest disbursal of emergency
funds calms nervous investors for now, Greece faces an uphill
task in trying to implement the reforms demanded by
international lenders which means the euro's path will be a
rocky one. 
 Broadly, it remained hemmed inside a broad range established
since early May.	
 Euro zone finance ministers on Saturday approved a 12
billion euro instalment of Greece's bailout and said details of
a second aid package for Athens would be finalised by
mid-September. 
 For now, markets will focus on a European Central Bank
policy rate decision on Thursday where it is widely expected to
raise interest rates though players will be more interested in
knowing the future trend of rate hikes, particularly in the
backdrop of weak data from Germany.	
 Improved appetite for risk and the end of the Federal
Reserve's quantitative easing policy reduced demand for U.S.
Treasury bonds, with yields on 10-year notes
settling at 3.18 percent, near its highest in almost two months
and adding to a weekly rise of more than 30 basis points.	
 U.S. crude futures  were trading above the $95 per
barrel mark, holding on to last week's gains, despite a surprise
move by the 28-nation International Energy Agency to release 60
million barrels of oil reserves. 
 Elsewhere, precious metals like gold and silver
eked out meagre gains in thin trading.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - It was a banner week for the
euro as Greece evaded a near-term default and investors
embraced risk, but don't expect a repeat performance given
investors' belief that the country's debt crisis is far from
over and concerns about the global economic recovery.
 Relief over Greece caused the euro to enjoy its best weekly
performance against the U.S. dollar since January.
 After days of Greece headlines, market participants next
week will turn their focus on U.S. economic data and a European
Central Bank monetary policy meeting.
 The Greek parliament passed two crucial austerity bills
this week, opening the way for international lenders to release
a 12-billion-euro ($17 billion) loan installment that Athens
urgently needs to stave off bankruptcy.
 ""The market turned a corner this week in terms of risk
sentiment, but the market is also extremely near-sighted,"" said
Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""What we had this past week was a relief rally and the
market can only breathe a sigh of relief for so long,"" he said.
""Next week we will see whether the euro's strength is sustained
or falters, but I am betting on the latter.""
 Uncertainty remains about a longer-term solution for
Greece. Euro-zone finance ministers are scheduled to hold
preliminary talks this weekend on the second financing package
for Greece for 2011-2014, which could total up to 120 billion
euros ($175 billion).
 ""The longer term picture still stands and a Greece default
is still very likely, with all the issues likely to arise again
in September,"" Dolan said.
 The euro last traded at $1.4512, up 0.1 percent on the day.
It had earlier risen to a three-week high of $1.4553 
on trading platform EBS. At current rates it's up 2.3 percent
this week, on pace for its biggest weekly advance since
January. It was also its first weekly gain against the dollar
in a month.
 The reemergence of risk aversion should send the euro to
$1.4250 by the end of next week, Dolan said.
 ""Overall, it has been a positive week for global risk
sentiment and a negative week for safe haven currencies such as
the U.S. dollar, yen and Swiss franc,"" said Vassili
Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 U.S. financial markets will be closed on Monday for the
Fourth of July holiday.
 The market may start to rebuild long euro positions ahead
of an expected interest-rate hike by the European Central Bank
next Thursday, which would further move interest-rate
differentials in favor of the euro.
 Markets are expecting ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet to
strike a hawkish tone after the meeting. However, they remain
reluctant to price in further tightening. See [ID:nL6E7I10UK]
 Weaker euro area activity data over the past month puts the
ECB in a precarious position at this juncture, analysts said.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 80.84 yen
.
 In the U.S. a slew of U.S. economic data could sway
currency market sentiment next week, namely ADP private
payrolls data on Wednesday and the U.S. Labor Department's
nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.
 This week marked the end of the U.S. Federal Reserve's
second round of quantitative easing, or QE2, as the program was
known. QE2 entailed buying $600 billion in U.S. Treasury
securities and was negative for the dollar as it was tantamount
to printing money,
 The end of the program is positive for the dollar, but U.S.
fiscal concerns and the government's debt ceiling debate should
continue to weigh on the dollar.
 ""While the end of the Fed's Treasury purchase program does
in our view remove a source of selling pressure on the dollar,
the uncertainty over the debt ceiling is becoming an
increasingly troubling issue for the greenback,"" Wells Fargo's
Serebriakov said.
 ""Until that uncertainty is resolved, the upside for the
dollar should remain limited,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week high
and headed for its best weekly performance against the U.S.
dollar since January as global risk appetite improved, but
gains are seen limited given investors' belief that Greece's
debt crisis is far from over.

 The dollar climbed 0.9 percent to 0.8476 franc ,

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday on
news that U.S. factory activity expanded more than expected in
June, while weakening industrial production in Asia kept oil
prices down.
 European stocks closed at their highest in one month and
Wall Street jumped more than 1 percent as the U.S. data
encouraged investors to extend a Greece-inspired rally for a
fifth day. For details, see [ID:nN1E7600H5].
 Prices of U.S. government debt fell after the U.S.
manufacturing data, which raised hopes the world's largest
economy may be recovering from a recent slowdown.
 ""The economy has passed the tipping point risk and growth
looks poised to resume a 3-percent-plus rate of gross domestic
product growth in the second half of the year,"" said Chris
Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ in New York.
 Major U.S. stock indexes were poised to record their best
week in nearly a year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 159.39
points, or 1.28 percent, at 12,573.73. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 16.63 points, or 1.26 percent, at
1,337.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 39.31
points, or 1.42 percent, at 2,812.83.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed 0.76 percent higher.
 Prices of benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes 
fell 13/32, driving yields up to 3.2084 percent, after the U.S.
manufacturing report.
 Gold prices  fell as low as $1,481.70 an ounce, their
weakest since May 17, as investors were relieved about the
approval of Greece's austerity package on Thursday, which eased
fears of an imminent default by the Greek government.
 In another sign of improved risk appetite, a key index of
U.S. subprime mortgage bond prices rose on Friday. The rise in
the benchmark ABX index was triggered by the positive
developments in the Greek sovereign debt crisis and by the
suspensions of the New York Fed's Maiden Lane II auctions,
Thomson Reuters' IFR said. [ID:nIFR1lWR3c]
 The Maiden Lane II portfolio was created during the depths
of the financial crisis to absorb the risky ""private-label""
mortgage securities from AIG , and help prevent the
collapse of what was then the world's largest insurer.
 FACTORY SLOWDOWN ELSEWHERE
 Still, investors remained concerned about the prospects for
the global economic recovery as manufacturing data from other
parts of the world were more sobering. [ID:nL3E7I11C0]
 In Asia and Europe, purchasing managers' indexes slid to
multi-month lows in June as factories fought weaker consumer
demand overseas and tightening monetary conditions at home.
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell 0.95 percent to $94.50 a
barrel after a report showed the Chinese factory sector grew at
its slowest pace in 28 months. China is the world's largest
consumer of raw materials. [ID:nL3E7I104E]
 ""There is no doubt that the growth rate is slowing,"" said
Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank in London. ""There is
nothing in the offing suggesting a rebound -- we are in for a
few months of slower growth,"" he said.
 The U.S. dollar rallied broadly after the ISM report but
subsequently erased its gains. It was flat against a basket of
major currencies, according to the U.S. dollar index <.DXY>.
The euro last traded at $1.4509, up 0.03 percent on the day.

 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday as

 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - World stocks and the dollar
rallied on Friday after U.S. factory activity expanded more
than expected, tempering concerns about a global economic
slowdown that had been heightened by weak data from elsewhere
in the world earlier in the day.
 Oil prices fell sharply as a stronger dollar made it more
expensive for non-U.S. investors. The commodity was also
pressured by a batch of weak global manufacturing data for
June, including from China, the world's largest consumer of raw
materials. For details, see [ID:nL3E7I11C0].
 Major Wall Street indexes initially opened flat, following
a Greece-inspired rally earlier in the week, but quickly gained

 * Euro holds gains vs dollar, Swissie suffers
 * Focus shifts away from Greece, risk demand, ECB in focus
 * Euro may gain more on strong U.S. ISM manufacturing data

 By Anirban Nag and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week high
against the dollar on Friday, buoyed by better risk sentiment
while the Swiss franc stumbled as Greece's passage of austerity
measures prompted investors to cut back long positions in the
safe-haven currency.	
 With another hurdle in the euro zone debt crisis cleared,
market participants saw more room for the euro to climb,
particularly if euro zone interest rates rise next week.	
 Before that, it would gain more support if U.S. economic
data due on Friday show the country's recovery is picking up.	
 The common currency was also bolstered by speculation that
some Asian central banks which are said to have intervened and
bought dollars in their respective currency markets, could
recycle those proceeds into the euro.	
 Analysts said the euro could gain more ground if the U.S.
ISM manufacturing report surprised on the upside. Risk appetite
was boosted on Thursday after data showed factory activity in
the U.S. Midwest accelerated in June, fostering hopes of a
pick-up in economic growth. 
 ""The market is bullish on risk and looking to buy euros,""
said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC. ""It
could rise to $1.47 against the dollar if the data pulse from
the U.S. keeps getting better. The Greek issues still linger,
but there is a bit of calm now with the markets' focus on data.""	
 The euro hit a three-week high of $1.4553 early in
the European session according to electronic trading platform
EBS, in a move which pushed through a big options barrier around
$1.4550. By 1120 GMT, it traded around $1.4530.	
 It took weak euro zone manufacturing surveys within its
stride, as the data did little to alter strong expectations that
the European Central Bank would raise interest rates next week.	
 Traders said the market was starting to rebuild long
positions before the ECB meets on Thursday, when it is seen
raising rates by 25 basis points to 1.50 percent. This would be
positive for the euro as it would increase its rate differential
against the dollar and other currencies .	
 ""There is a bit more upside in the euro ahead of the ECB
meeting and if (President Jean-Claude) Trichet strikes a hawkish
bias,"" said Chris Walker currency strategist at UBS. ""But a lot
will be contingent on current economic conditions.""	
 The Swiss franc took a beating, driving both the dollar and
the euro more than half a percent higher on the day.	
 The dollar rallied to 0.8475 francs according to EBS,
rebounding further from a lifetime low of 0.8276 hit earlier in
the week. Traders cited corporate-related demand from Swiss
banks as driving the dollar higher.	
 This helped to push the euro to 1.2301 francs
according to EBS, its highest in three weeks, before it trimmed
gains on profit-taking.	
 Gains in the dollar versus the Swiss franc pushed the U.S.
currency higher versus a currency basket, pushing the dollar
index up 0.2 percent to 74.487. 
 
 EURO SUPPORTED	
 Some market participants cautioned that a squaring of long
positions taken in the euro this week may put the single
currency at risk of some selling ahead of a three-day holiday
weekend in the United States.	
 But traders expected any downside would be limited, after
the single currency rallied nearly 3 percent from Monday's
trough around $1.4100.	
 ""I think $1.4460 is a decent level now on the downside and I
think people will be looking to buy on dips,"" said a trader in
London.	
 Lower down, it was well supported around $1.4405, where its
55- and 21-day moving averages were located, along with the top
of its Ichimoku cloud. Treading above that cloud is considered a
bullish signal according to the popular technical analysis tool.	
 The euro is poised to gain more than 2 percent in a dramatic
week which saw market sentiment swing from worries that Greece
would go bankrupt to relief that it would get through the
crisis, against a backdrop of violent protests and general
strikes over austerity steps.	
 Euro resistance is seen at around $1.4570, the 61.8 percent
retracement of the euro's fall from its May 4 high of $1.4940 to
its recent low of $1.3970 on May 23.	
 The Greek parliament approved a detailed austerity plan on
Thursday, paving the way for 12 billion euros of international
aid. .

 * Euro retains strong gains seen this week
 * Focus shifts from Greece as it is set for emergency funds
 * U.S. ISM manufacturing data in focus on Friday

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
three-week high against the dollar on Friday, buoyed by better
risk sentiment with more gains likely as investors shift their
focus from the euro zone's sovereign debt troubles to upcoming
U.S. economic data.	
 The common currency was also bolstered by speculation that
some Asian central banks which are said to have intervened and
bought dollars in their respective currency markets, could
recycle those proceeds into the euro.	
 It took weak euro zone manufacturing surveys within its
stride, as the data did little to alter strong expectations that
the European Central Bank would raise interest rates next week.	
 The euro hit a three-week high of $1.4553 early in
the European session, when it pushed through a big options
barrier around $1.4550. It eased to trade at around $1.45 on
news that Moody's has downgraded Munich Reinsurance Life
Reinsurance E.E.C.A .	
 Despite that, it is still up nearly 3 percent from Monday's
trough around $1.4100 in a dramatic week that saw market
sentiment swing from worries that Greece would go bankrupt to
relief that it would get through the crisis, against a backdrop
of violent protests and general strikes over austerity steps.	
 The Greek parliament approved a detailed austerity plan on
Thursday, paving the way for 12 billion euros of international

$1.4570, the 61.8 percent retracement of the euro's fall from

 DOLLAR SHORTS	
 Some investors were looking to cover short positions in the
dollar ahead of the weekend and lock in profits on outperforming
commodity currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand
dollars after China's purchasing managers' index came in
slightly below expectations at 50.9. 
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.2
percent at 74.442.	
 The dollar made solid gains against the Swiss franc
which was broadly under pressure as investors unwound long
positions with worries about Greece fading into the background
for now. The dollar was up 0.7 percent at 0.8462 francs while
the euro gained 0.8 percent to 1.2295 francs . The
single currency was on-track to post a 4 percent weekly gain.	
 ""The unwind of the Swiss franc safe-haven trade was very
much in evidence on Thursday and with the Ecofin likely to
approve the next 12 billion tranche of aid over the weekend, we
see scope for Euro/Swiss franc to extend gains well beyond the
two big figures seen so far,"" BNP Paribas said in a note.	
 Against the yen, however, the dollar edged higher after
solid bids by investment trust funds around 80.50 yen. Retail
investors were pouring their summer bonuses into foreign
investment trust funds, drawing yen-selling demand.	
 Dollar/yen last traded up 0.3 percent at 80.75 yen, but
exporters cited sell orders lined up above 81 yen.	
 Meanwhile, sterling fell to a 15-month low against a basket
of currencies and the euro after a UK survey showed
manufacturing activity grew at its slowest pace in almost two
years in June, backing expectations that rates will be at
ultra-low levels in the coming months.	
 Sterling was last down 0.3 percent at $1.5996 while the euro
was up 0.2 percent at 90.56 pence.

 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Investors put the Greek crisis
behind them at least temporarily on Friday, letting the euro hit
a three-week high against the dollar at one point, as they
focused instead on the state of the world economy.	
 Stocks were higher globally, but Europe slipped after four
days of gains. Wall Street looked set for small gains.	
 China's factory sector grew at its slowest pace in 28 months
in June as new orders expanded less quickly, with weaker global
demand and tight monetary policy at home pinching production.

 The U.S. economy, however, was providing a rare boost.
Midwest business activity showed surprising strength in June,
lifted by a jump in new orders, according to the Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago said.	
 Weak euro zone manufacturing surveys had little impact.	
 ""Positive global economic data including from the United
States and progress in Greece on its debt problems are stoking
appetite for stocks today,"" said Lee Sun-yeb, a market analyst
at Shinhan Investment Corp, looking at the global picture.	
 Data from Reuters asset allocation polls on Thursday
suggested that investors were entering the third quarter in a
cautious mood. But they raised their equity holdings in June for
the first time since January.	
 The big asset winners in the first half were primarily
commodities as well as high-yield bonds. MSCI data showed
developed stocks returning 5.6 percent over the
first half -- capital gain plus dividends -- and emerging
markets just 1 percent for the first half.	
 Greece's passage of an austerity plan during the week,
opening the door to a tranche of new bailout money, has allowed
investors to put immediate concerns about default and debt
crisis contagion to one side.	
 There's relief Greece hasn't gone bad. But there's also
nervousness, as we look to see whether the U.S. consumer is
showing more confidence or not,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart,
director at Seven Investment Management.	
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was up
0.1 percent, heading for a 4 percent or more weekly gain.
Emerging markets gaining around half a percent and Japan's
Nikkei closing up half a percent.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was flat.	
 
 EURO GAINS	
 The euro hit a three-week high against the dollar, but later
slipped back to flat.	
 It rose as high as $1.4553 according to electronic
trading platform EBS, its highest since early June. The euro has
rallied some 3 percent from Monday's trough around $1.4100.	
 ""The market is bullish on risk and looking to buy euros,""
said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC. ""It
could rise to $1.47 against the dollar if the data pulse from
the U.S. keeps getting better. The Greek issues still linger,
but there is a bit of calm now with the markets' focus on data.""	
 Core euro zone government bonds were flat.

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a three-week
high against the dollar on Friday, buoyed by better risk
sentiment with investors shifting their focus from the euro
zone's sovereign debt troubles to upcoming U.S. economic data.	
 The common currency was also bolstered by speculation that
some Asian central banks which are said to have intervened and
bought dollars in their respective currency markets, could
recycle those proceeds into the euro.	
 The euro traded at $1.4520 , up 0.1 percent on the

said Sumino Kamei, a senior currency analyst at the Bank of

 ""If such clues are not provided, the euro ... may be sold

 By Ian Chua and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro's advance against
the dollar lost momentum on Friday after a rally this week as
the market focus shifted to upcoming economic data, with Greece
looking set to secure emergency funds and avert imminent
default.	
 The single currency, however, was supported by buying from
Asian central banks after early rounds of profit-taking had
pushed it down to an Asian session low of $1.4467, Tokyo bank
dealers said.	
 Investors broadly covered short positions in the dollar and
locked in profits on outperforming commodity currencies such as
the Australian and New Zealand dollars after China's purchasing
managers' index came in slightly below expectations at
50.9. 
 The euro was also well-supported against the yen and the
Aussie with traders saying the market was starting to rebuild
longs ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank monetary policy
meeting.	
 Investors will focus on a news conference by ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet following the meeting, during which it is
expected to raise interest rates again, with data earlier this
week showing inflation in June having stabilised well above the
bank's target. 
 ""A possible rate hike is already priced in and investors
will now look for suggestions of any potential further hikes,""
said Sumino Kamei, a senior currency analyst at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 ""If such clues are not provided, the euro ... may be sold
off even more aggressively,"" said Kamei. It would probably come
under some short-term pressure anyway, because people would try
to ""sell the fact,"" she said.	
 The euro traded at $1.4514 , up 0.1 percent from
$1.4504 late in New York, where it peaked near $1.4539, a level
not seen since June 10.	
 It has rallied some 3 percent from Monday's trough around
$1.4100 in a dramatic week that saw market sentiment swing from
worries that Greece would go bankrupt to relief that it would
get through the crisis, against a backdrop of violent protests
and general strikes over austerity steps.	
 Immediate resistance for the common currency is seen at the
overnight high, with the 55-day moving average of $1.4404 likely
to provide support.	
 But in the long term, the euro may regain more ground
against the dollar after data showed factory activity in the
U.S. Midwest accelerated in June, ahead of the national ISM
manufacturing report due later on Friday. 
 ""With Greece passing the votes to clear the way for the next
tranche of EU/IMF support, the key to a move to EUR/USD 1.50 and
beyond is confirmation that the soft patch is not something much
more sinister,"" Societe Generale strategists wrote in a note.	
 ""ISM and payrolls loom, but we expect July/August to see a
friendlier environment for the euro, a less friendly one for yen
and dollar.""	
 Indeed, the dollar index , which tracks the
greenback's performance against a basket of major currencies,
languished near three-week lows. It last stood at 74.34, after
falling as low as 74.255.	
 
 SUPPORTED BY TOSHIN, CAPPED BY EXPORTERS	
 Against the yen, however, the dollar edged higher after
solid bids by investment trust funds around 80.50 yen. Retail
investors were pouring their summer bonuses into foreign
investment trust funds, drawing yen-selling demand, says Tsutomu
Soma, a senior manager at Okasan Securities.	
 ""We are expected to see flows from retail investors for July
too, which should keep dollar/yen solid,"" Soma said. It last
traded up 0.2 percent at 80.70 yen. But exporters cited sell
orders lined up above 81 yen.	
 Still, it stayed within a well-trodden range of 79.50-82.20
yen seen in the last two months. 
 The Aussie fell as low as $1.0673 as stop-loss orders were
triggered around $1.0690 shortly after the Chinese PMI figures
came out. It has recouped most of its losses towards the end of
the session, having found strong support above its 55-day moving
average of $1.0661.	
 Commodity currencies have been among the star performers
this week. The Australian dollar rallied some 3 percent from
Monday's trough to a high of $1.0750 . It has since
given back a bit of ground to trade at $1.0694.	
 Sterling was again the biggest loser, hovering close
15-month lows on the euro and rebounding only mildly from a
26-year trough on the Aussie, as analysts slash British growth
forecasts after a run of dismal data.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, July 1 (Reuters) - Asian equities hit their
highest level in nearly a month on Friday, lifted by
receding fears of a default by Greece and encouraging data from
the U.S. overnight, while the euro touched a fresh
three-week high. 
 Stocks in Asia opened the new quarter on a positive note,
with the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
touching its highest level since early June. The index was
last up 0.4 percent at 483.13. 
 The markets appear to have taken weaker-than-expected
China data in their stride. The MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific
shares briefly trimmed gains after the announcement but later
regained ground. 
 Financial bookmakers predicted that European shares
were set to open flat to lower on Friday after hitting a near
one-month high a day earlier. 
 ""Positive global economic data including from the United
States and progress in Greece on its debt problems are stoking
appetite for stocks today,"" said Lee Sun-yeb, a market analyst
at Shinhan Investment Corp.	
 Greece's parliament approved detailed austerity and
privatisation bills on Thursday in a crucial vote to secure
emergency funds and avert imminent bankruptcy. 
 Data on Thursday showing that factory activity in the U.S.
Midwest accelerated in June also helped lift equities, with
Japan's benchmark Nikkei average rising 0.5 percent
, and South Korean shares climbing 1.2 percent
. 
 The latest U.S. data and the receding concerns over
Greece may help lift global equities from their recent doldrums,
said Kiyoshi Noda, chief fund manager for MU Investments in
Tokyo. 
 ""Equities have been struggling due to an economic
slowdown in the United States, monetary tightening in China and
emerging market economies, and the problems with Greece,"" Noda
said. 
 ""But there are signs that all of these factors may have
passed a peak,"" Noda said, adding that global equities seem
poised to rise in the July-September quarter. 
 The MSCI World Index had dipped 0.5 percent in the
April-June quarter , having lost steam after
rallying 3.9 percent in January-March. 
 Asian equities took in their stride data showing that
China's factory sector grew at its slowest pace in 28 months in
June. China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to
50.9 in June from 52 in May. 
 Although the moderation in activity did not point to a
sharp drop-off in Chinese economic growth for now, the data was
slightly worse than forecast and led some analysts to predict
China may be less aggressive in tightening monetary policy
conditions later this year. 
 
 ECB EYED	
 The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.4538 , having
touched a fresh three-week high of 1.4545 at one point. 
 The currency market will now focus on the European Central
Bank's news conference following its policy meeting on Thursday,
when it is expected to raise interest rates again, with data
earlier this week showing inflation in June stabilised well
above the bank's target. 
 ""The possible rate hike is already priced in and investors
will now look for suggestions of any potential further hikes,""
said Sumino Kamei, a senior currency analyst at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. 
 ""If such clues are not provided, the euro ... may be sold
off even more aggressively,"" said Kamei. It would probably come
under some short-term pressure anyway, because people would try
to ""sell the fact"", she said. 
 In commodities, U.S. corn futures slid 5.3 percent
, extending their losses after tumbling 10 percent on
Thursday, their biggest decline on record.	
 U.S. corn futures took a dive on Thursday after a U.S.
government report significantly raised crop prospects and stocks
levels for the United States, alleviating worries of a global
food shortage. 
 The slide in U.S. corn futures had some traders fretting
over the potential for knock-on effects on other commodities.
But it could prove a welcome relief for Asian countries fighting
to contain inflation.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro leaped to a three-week
high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and headed for a second
quarterly gain as Greece passed crucial bills to avert immediate
default and on expectations that euro-zone interest rates will rise
again next week.
 Greece approved detailed austerity and privatization bills
on Thursday in a crucial vote to secure emergency international
aid. But analysts said longer-term dangers still lurk with
credit insurance markets pricing in an 80 percent chance of
Greece defaulting within five years. See [ID:nL6E7HU0SS]
 ""While much uncertainty about the outlook for Greece
remains, the euro should enjoy additional near-term gains on
the notion that imminent default is likely to be avoided,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
 Investors will now likely turn attention to talks on
private-sector participation in a new Greek assistance program.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he had reached
agreement with German banks and he expected a euro-zone deal on
Sunday, based on a French plan for a voluntary debt rollover.
[ID:nB4E7HR01H]
 This type of plan should give the euro additional gains,
but doubts about Greece's ability to effectively implement
additional austerity measures should keep the euro's upside
limited, Esiner said.
 Month-end flows supported the euro, helping propel it to a
three-week high above $1.45. The euro hit a high of $1.45388
 on trading platform EBS and last traded at $1.4514,
up 0.6 percent for the day.
 Traders cited offers from sovereign names ahead of a
reported options barrier at $1.4550. Support is seen in the
mid-$1.44 region.
 The euro is on track for a 2.6 percent gain this quarter
and an 8.5 percent gain in the first half of the year.
 Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar's share of allocated currency
reserves fell in the first quarter, while global central bank
holdings surged to a record near $10 trillion. [ID:nN1E75T11M]
 Steven Englander, global head of G10 strategy at CitiFX, a
division of Citigroup in New York, said one take-away is that
the reserve manager community as a whole did not have a uniform
EUR buying bias.
 ""This is a big surprise, given how many anecdotal reports of
reserve manager buying of EUR emerged in Q1,"" he said. ""This
adds to our skepticism that the EUR's gains are sustainable.""
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to 90.33 pence , having hit
a 15-month high of 90.70 pence, the strongest level since March,
2010. It also jumped to a two-week high against the Swiss franc,
rallying 1.4 percent to 1.2213 Swiss francs .
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 80.58 yen , on track for
a loss of 3 percent this quarter and a loss of 0.8 percent for the
first half of this year.
 The euro also found support after the European Central Bank
signaled it would raise interest rates again next week as data
showed inflation in June well above the bank's target. See

 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - World stocks rose to their
highest level in month and the euro surged on Thursday as
Greece approved the final austerity measures needed to secure
international funding and avert imminent bankruptcy.
 An unexpected jump in business activity in the U.S. Midwest
helped quell fears about an economic slowdown that have weighed
on equities over the past two months, pushing investors into
stocks and out of safe-haven U.S. government bonds on the last
day of the quarter. For details, see [ID:nN9E7HG00J].
 Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds fell for a fourth straight
day and as the Federal Reserve marked the end of its $600
billion bond-buying program to stimulate the economy.
 Speculation that Greece would pass its austerity plans had
sparked a sell-off in Treasuries and a big rally in equity
markets earlier this week.
 ""Fear of an imminent euro collapse has been put to bed, and
anyone who has been on the sidelines can come back in,"" said
Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Faros Trading in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 The Greek Parliament approved detailed austerity and
privatization bills required by the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for emergency funding.
[ID:nL6E7HU0SS]
 Copper prices rose to a two-month high as the passage of
Greece's austerity plan supported investors' appetite for risky
assets, as well as positioning ahead of the end of the quarter.
Three-month copper  on the London Metal Exchange closed
at $9,430 -- its highest since end-April
 ""There's a relief rally -- it suggests there was some
uncertainty prior to the vote that maybe the implementation
part would cause problems, and now that it didn't you've seen
this relief rally come through,"" Danske Bank analyst Christin
Tuxen said.
 Goldman Sachs in a research note said that its ""commodity
team expects the recent sell-off to reverse and for many
commodities to breach their recent highs over the next 12
months."" Goldman said it sees Brent crude oil reaching $130 a
barrel in 12 months.
 In equity markets, the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> climbed 1.3 percent in its fourth session of
gains to its highest level since June 2. In Europe, the
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top shares rose, with a
provisional close up 1.1 percent at 1,110.97 points.
 On Wall Street, the surprisingly strong data on U.S.
Midwest factory activity bolstered sentiment as the vote in
Greece meant that investors could refocus on the economy as the
quarterly earnings season prepares to get under way.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 137.40 points,
or 1.12 percent, to 12,398.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> added 12.52 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,319.93. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 30.82 points, or 1.12
percent, to 2,771.31.
 The CBOE volatility index<.VIX> , which is known as the VIX
and is a widely used measure of fear on Wall Street, fell
nearly 7 percent to its lowest level in a month.
 The euro  was headed for its second quarterly gain
against the dollar after the Greek Parliament passed the
crucial austerity measures. The euro gained 0.6 percent to
$1.4521.
 ""There has been less demand for euros lately, given all the
uncertainty. But this brings some certainty back to the market
-- at least for the next year -- and the euro should rally
considerably,"" said Borthwick.
 Expectations of another euro-zone rate rise next week,
bolstered by comments from European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet, also supported the European single
currency.
 The weaker dollar earlier helped push up oil prices. But
ICE Brent crude  later fell, losing 0.66 percent to
$111.66 a barrel as investors worried about violence in Greece
and remained uncertain about the International Energy Agency's
emergency release plan for crude stocsk.

 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
rose to their highest in three weeks on Thursday as Greece
approved the final austerity measures to secure international
funding and avoid bankruptcy.
 An unexpected jump in business activity in the U.S. Midwest
further pushed investors into stocks and out of safe-haven U.S.

can't pay back its debt.""

 Despite the boost from a weaker dollar, ICE Brent crude
 was 40 cents lower at $112 a barrel. U.S. crude 
was at $94.84 a barrel, up 7 cents, after gaining 2 percent in
the previous session.

 * Euro gains vs dollar, sterling, but fails to hold above
$1.45
 * Investors relieved Greek debt problems under control for
now
 * More euro gains possible on ECB rate rise speculation

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, June 30 - The euro rose to a three-week high against
the dollar on Thursday, swept higher by month-end demand which
helped it extend a rally after Greece moved a step closer to
securing international aid.	
 The single currency was also buoyed after comments from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet reinforced
speculation that the ECB will raise interest rates next week,
helping it to a 15-month high versus sterling. 
 Markets cheered the Greek parliament's passage of tough
austerity measures on Wednesday, enabling the debt-stricken
country to secure more emergency funding from the EU and the
International Monetary Fund and staving off the threat of a debt
default for now.	
 The euro hit a high of $1.4522 versus the dollar on
trading platform EBS and analysts said further gains could
propel it towards $1.5000. However, many remained wary about
whether Greece will be able to implement such harsh measures and
expected the euro's rise to be limited.	
 It failed to sustain a move above $1.4500, with traders
saying demand from a semi-official European name and model funds
ran into offers from sovereign names ahead of a reported options
barrier at $1.4550. 
 ""Euro zone rates are more likely to rise than those in the
U.S. and the UK and this will keep the euro supported against
the dollar and sterling,"" said Richard Wiltshire, chief FX
broker at ETX Capital.	
 ""But I can't see a huge reason to buy the euro as Greece is
not out of the woods yet"".	
 Athens on Thursday is expected to pass another vote on how
to implement the plan, clearing the last obstacle to the release
of 12 billion euros ($17.3 billion) of funding, which is
essential to meet debt payments by mid-July. 
 It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.4460 against the dollar,
with bids in the mid-$1.44 region seen as acting as support.	
 ETX's Wiltshire said the euro's gains were helped by hefty
month-end buying of euro/sterling, some of which could reverse
on Friday or next week.	
 The single currency was up 0.5 percent against the pound
at 90.30 pence, having hit a 15-month high of 90.70
pence.

 ECB RATE OUTLOOK	
 Bolstering the euro was the view that the European Central
Bank will raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent
next week, which would increase the single currency's rate
advantage over the dollar.	
 Some analysts also saw further scope for short-term gains as
talks progress on a second aid package for Greece, with
investors taking the view that the euro zone debt crisis is
under control for the time being.	
 ""In the short term, at least, a Greece default is unlikely,
and this is positive for the euro and also other risky assets,""
said You-Na Park, currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt, adding the euro could test $1.50 in the near term.	
 Others said more encouraging data in the U.S., including
recent housing figures, and signs the Japanese economy may be
recovering more quickly from its earthquake than expected, were
helping to improve the broad outlook for the global economy
through the second half of 2011.	
 Deutsche currency strategist Henrik Gullberg said this view
would further stoke risk appetite, prompting investors to take
on more long euro positions -- or bets to buy the currency --
after cutting back on those positions recently. 
 ""Uncertainty about the global outlook, as well as Greece,
has meant that a lot of long positions in risky currencies have
been scaled back,"" he said.	
 At the same time, increasing concerns about the U.S. debt
situation may sour sentiment for the dollar as Washington
struggles to raise its budget limit.	
 Gains in the euro and other currencies considered higher
risk, including the Australian and New Zealand dollars
-- the latter hitting a post-float high in earlier
trade -- knocked the dollar lower versus a currency basket.	
 The dollar index traded 0.25 percent lower as 74.503,
having hit 74.255, its weakest since mid-June. It slipped 0.4
percent on the day to 80.40 yen .

 By Dominic Lau	
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro hit
three-week highs on Thursday after Greece took a step closer to
avoiding a default in the short term.	
 Expectations for another euro zone rate rise next week,
bolstered by comments from European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet, also supported the euro and helped keep oil
prices close to $112 a barrel as worries about inflation
balanced against a weaker dollar.	
 U.S. stock index futures    were up 0.2 to
0.3 percent, indicating a firm open for Wall Street but global
equities were poised to end the month with their first quarterly
loss in a year.
 The Greek parliament is set to approve a final austerity
bill needed to secure 12 billion euros ($17 billion) of
international aid later in the day after passing initial
legislation on Wednesday.	
 Athens's latest efforts to tackle its debt crisis helped
remove some near-term uncertainty in global markets, offering
some respite at the end of a quarter which saw global equities
and commodities suffer losses.	
 Concerns that the U.S. and Chinese economies are slowing
also weighed on financial markets in the second quarter, with
world stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
down 1.3 percent in April-June and on track for
the benchmark's first quarterly loss in a year.	
 U.S. Treasuries, however, were boosted by the uncertainty
despite the Federal Reserve's plan to end its bond-buying
programme this month. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries
have fallen about 38 basis points so far this
quarter.	
 On Thursday, the MSCI All-Country World Index was up 0.5
percent. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average ended 0.2
percent higher on the day to post a 0.6 percent rise for the
second quarter after losing 4.6 percent in January-March.	
 Investors, however, will be closely watching whether Greece
can actually implement the planned austerity measures, which
include selling state assets, and which are harsh and deeply
unpopular. Credit insurance markets still price in an 80 percent
chance of Greece defaulting on its 340 billion euro debt pile
within five years.	
 ""The main focus will shift to the implementation of the
austerity plan and whether Greece is reaching its target,"" RBS
said in a note.	
 ""It is likely that Greece will not meet the very strict
austerity budget and reform targets and so the markets will be
focused on how Greece reacts to the very likely demands for
remedial measures at some point -- with eyes then obviously on
the quarterly IMF review, next due in September and December.""	
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index added 0.1 percent
on Thursday after surging 1.7 percent the previous session,
while Greece's share benchmark put on 1.3 percent and the
Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone index gained 1
percent.	
 ""Greece is just avoiding one default, it is going to be
difficult to sell off (state-owned) assets and the public is
against what the government is doing and sometime down the line
that has got to come to a head,"" said Will Hedden, sales trader
at IG Index in London.	
 Reflecting such concerns in the markets, Greece's 10-year
government bond yields rose 6.6 basis points to
16.611 percent, though they were off their euro lifetime peak of
18.90 percent hit two weeks ago.	


 FIRM EURO	
 ""In the short term, at least, a Greece default is unlikely,
and this is positive for the euro and also other risky assets,""
said You-Na Park, currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 ""In the course of the next week or so, a second aid package
should be decided, so there is room for the euro to rise more.""	
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4467 and has risen
2.1 percent so far this quarter, taking its first-half gain to
more than 8 percent, boosted by euro zone interest rate
differentials with the United States.	
 ECB chief Trichet scotched speculation on Thursday that the
bank may delay interest rate rises because of Greece's plight
and the contagion threat it poses. 
 The ECB is expected to raise interest rates next week from
the current 1.25 percent.	
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of
currencies.	
 Boosted by the Greek vote and a soft dollar, copper prices
rose 0.3 percent, though the metal is down 0.9 percent
so far in the second quarter.	
 Gold eased 0.2 percent to trade above $1,500 an
ounce, hurt by some improvement in sentiment, though the
precious metal is up 5.5 this quarter, on track for its 11th
straight quarter of gains. 
 Brent crude  held above $112 a barrel after rising
for three straight sessions. Brent crude is down 4.4 percent
this quarter, on track for its first quarterly loss in a year.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro surged to a
three-week peak against the dollar on Thursday, swept higher by
a wave of stop-loss buying and extending a rally after Greece
moved a step closer to securing international aid. 
 Dollar-selling by macro hedge funds, a flurry of
short-covering in the euro, and traders establishing long euro
positions all helped lift the single currency, which extended
its gains further after taking out an option barrier at $1.45. 
 
 The rise came after Greek lawmakers voted by a clear margin
for a five-year austerity plan. The solid margin suggested the
government should be able to push through a second package of
laws on Thursday, implementing specific budget measures and
asset sales.	
 This would clear the last obstacle to the release of 12
billion euro ($17.3 billion) of emergency loans from the
International Monetary Fund and European Union, which are
essential to meet debt payments by mid-July. 
 Traders said the euro could rise further in the near-term,
helped by market expectations for the European Central Bank to
raise interest rates in July.	
 ""My sense is that even with all of its problems, the euro
will attract buying by process of elimination, since it is in
rate-rise mode,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for Okasan
Securities' foreign securities department in Tokyo.	
 ""I think there is a good chance we may see a rise close to
the mid-June peak near $1.47,"" Soma said, referring to the
euro's potential upside over the next month.	
 The euro climbed 0.5 percent to $1.4498 . At one
point, it rose as far as $1.45195 on trading platform EBS, its
highest level in about three weeks. Traders cited talk of
stop-loss euro bids at levels around $1.4510 to $1.4550.	
 The euro's rise over the past couple of days has improved
its outlook on the daily Ichimoku chart, a popular technical
analysis tool. Euro/dollar has risen above the Ichimoku cloud, a
move that is considered to be a bullish signal.	
 Ahead of the euro's early June peak right near $1.47, one
possible upside target sits at about $1.4550, roughly a 76.4
percent retracement of the euro's drop from the high near $1.47
down to its mid-June trough around $1.4070.	
 The euro also faces resistance near $1.4540, trendline
resistance drawn off peaks hit in early May and early June.	
 ""Heading into the end of the week we may see some squaring
up. However, the euro should remain well supported heading into
the July 7 ECB meeting, where we expect the ECB to hike by 25
basis points,"" said Callum Henderson, global head of FX research
with Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.

 RISK-ON MOOD	
 One uncertainty is whether the Greek government will be able
to actually implement the deeply unpopular cuts required to meet
a tight schedule imposed by the EU and IMF before the next round
of bailout funds are needed. 
 For now though, the outcome has helped soothe market
worries, giving investors a reason to get back into risk assets.	
 A trader for a Japanese bank in Tokyo said some market
players were spotted taking new long positions in the euro.	
 ""We're again in a 'risk-on' mood and with the euro and
commodities currencies on the rise, cross/yen may also be chased
a fair bit higher in coming weeks,"" the trader said.	
 Top of the shopping list for them were commodity
currencies, which rallied across the board. The Australian
dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0737.	
 The Aussie added to gains made on Wednesday, when it climbed
above resistance at its 55-day average near $1.0660 and the top
of the daily Ichimoku cloud near $1.0650, possibly setting
itself up for a further rise.	
 The New Zealand dollar hit a 26-year high of $0.8320
, and was last up 0.5 percent at $0.8292.	
 Not surprisingly, the U.S. dollar was among the main
casualties. The dollar index , which tracks its
performance against a basket of major currencies, touched its
lowest in more than two weeks at one point, and last stood at
74.342. 
 The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 80.41 yen , with
traders citing active dollar-selling by Japanese exporters.	
 The dollar slipped 0.4 percent versus the Swiss franc to
0.8313 , nearing a record low of 0.8276 hit on EBS this
week. 
 Weakness in the dollar came as President Barack Obama
challenged U.S. lawmakers to make progress on a budget deal to
avert a possible default in early August. 
 A recent surge in U.S. Treasury yields and the end of the
Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE2), or asset-buying
programme, gave little support to the greenback. 
 With Greece likely to fade into the background after
Thursday's vote, market attention is set to turn to economic
data including a raft of manufacturing surveys from the major
economies including the U.S. ISM report on Friday.

 By Eric Burroughs	
 HONG KONG, June 30 (Reuters) - Asian stocks climbed on
Thursday as investors breathed a sigh of relief after Greece
moved a step closer to avoiding a default by adopting harsh
austerity measures, a move that boosted the euro and sparked a
broad rebound in risky assets.	
 European shares were set for gains, with futures on the Dow
Jones Eurostoxx 50  up 0.5 percent.	
 As the first half of the year drew to a close, Greece's
latest efforts to cut back on debt stirred hopes that it would
remove some of the uncertainty hanging over markets.	
 Worries that the U.S. and Chinese economies are quickly
slowing, on top of the fears that Greece might be headed for a
messy debt restructuring, had prompted a broad pull-back in
equities and commodities while boosting safe-haven bonds.	
 Analysts at Goldman Sachs recommended that clients start
adding to risk in their portfolios with the Greek crisis
dissipating for now, arguing that the economic headwinds from
high oil prices and Japanese supply chain disruptions were
fading. 
 ""Most investors are cautious, if not outright negative, and
light on risk,"" said Goldman strategists in a note to clients.
""We have started to add pro-cyclical positions for the first
time in two months. Data might disappoint a little further in
the near term, but we think the risk-reward is becoming more
asymmetric.""	
 The euro pushed higher for a fourth straight day after the
Greek parliament passed the measure by a margin of 155 to 138,
raising hopes that a second vote on implementing the laws would
also make it through amid violent protests in Athens.

 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 1.6 percent and set to finish the first
half of the year just barely in positive territory -- showing
the resilience of equities to all the worries plaguing
investors.	
 Among the regional sectors, consumer discretionary shares
were the best performer so far this year, rising
10 percent on the back of sharp gains in South Korean automakers
Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors as the two
grab market share in the United States from Japanese rivals. 
 Tech shares have fared the worst, losing 6.5
percent as Asia's big computer and chipmakers struggle with
softening sales.	
 Stocks also gained as market players covered short positions
that had been built up heading into the Greek parliamentary
votes. Short positions on Hong Kong's Hang Seng index
reached their highest levels since the financial crisis in 2008
this week.	
 Japan's broad TOPIX index was up 0.6 percent but
down 5.5 percent on the year following the supply chain
disruptions from the massive March 11 quake and on worries about
power outages in the hotter summer weeks ahead.	
 Gold slipped to $1,513.05 an ounce , while U.S. crude
oil prices  rose 31 cents at $95.08 a barrel.	
 As the first half of 2011 winds down, equities, commodities
and bonds were set for slight gains -- giving some indication
that the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond buying programme
has given a broad lift to asset prices. 
 The MSCI World index is up 2.6 percent,
while the Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodities is
up 1.8 percent and major bond market indices were in positive
territory. The Bank of America-Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury
Master index has posted a year-to-date return of 2.5
percent.	
 
 AN EVENTFUL 2011	
 The latest chapter in the euro zone crisis is one of several
events this year -- worries about inflation in Asia, the Arab
Spring revolutions, surging oil prices, Japan's nuclear scare,
the coming end of QE2 -- that have roiled markets.	
 Investors were squaring up positions before closing their
books while looking to see if the uncertainty around the global
economy clears in coming months.	
 The euro rose 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade to $1.4495
and popped above $1.45 , while the dollar dipped 0.4
percent to 80.40 yen . 
 The high-yielding Australian dollar, which is traded as a
proxy on Chinese and global growth, jumped 0.6 percent to
$1.0730 
 The dollar had surged across the board as market players
sought safer havens heading into the Greek parliamentary votes
this week, but as the support for austerity became clear some of
those funds have headed back into risky assets.	
 Safe-haven government bonds have also retreated.	
 Benchmark 10-year Japanese bond yields edged
up 1.5 basis points to 1.130 percent, up from a seven-month low
hit earlier this week and are up just slightly from the start of
the year. U.S. Treasuries steadied after a three-day selloff.	
 In a Reuters poll, Japanese fund managers cut their global
stock weighting and boosted their Japan bond weighting to a
record high 38.8 percent in June, showing how many investors are
being extra cautious about taking risk. 
 The fact that caution was running so high suggested that
markets might be near a turning point that would be positive for
stocks and risky assets since investors may find themselves
missing out on any further rally.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for the
third straight day and oil prices jumped on Wednesday after
Greece's parliament approved the first of two austerity
measures aimed at preventing the country from going bankrupt.
 Gold and other commodities rose on investors' appetite for
riskier assets, while safe-havens lost some of their appeal as
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou won a key battle to
ensure the disbursement of a 12 billion euro tranche from a
bailout program the country needs to avoid default next month.
 ""Certainly the fear that Greece is going to default now
has subsided,"" said Ken Polcari, managing director of ICAP
Equities in New York. ""Although it is still not a done deal --
but the fact is, it is certainly moving along, so that is
obviously positive.""
 Greece's government must now win approval on Thursday for
legislation detailing specific implementation measures for its
28 billion euro austerity package. For more see [ID:nLDE75S1KY]
[ID:nL6E7HT0PS]
 ""Risk seems to be back in the market after weeks of
risk-off. That's helping the equities move higher,"" said Eric
Marshall, director of research at Hodges Capital Management in
Dallas.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> climbed
1.41 percent in its third session of gains. In Europe, the
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top shares hit its highest
close in two weeks, up 1.65 percent.
 Major Wall Street indexes closed higher on the Greek vote
and on a mildly encouraging U.S. report on pending home sales.
The S&P 500 index is up more than 2 percent this week.
 Pending home sales rose a stronger-than-expected 8.2
percent in May, but a glut of unsold properties remained a drag
on the housing market. [ID:nN1E75R1XG]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 72.73
points, or 0.60 percent, at 12,261.42. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 10.74 points, or 0.83 percent, at
1,307.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 11.18 points,
or 0.41 percent, at 2,740.49.
 U.S. crude oil  rose $1.88, or 2.02 percent, to
settle at $94.77 per barrel on data showing sharp drops in U.S.
crude oil and gasoline stockpiles last week, as well as on the
Greek vote.
 The euro  rose 0.5 percent to 1.4434 against the
dollar, near the session peak of $1.4447, on expectations the
next Greek vote will pass on Thursday. But concerns over
whether the government can implement the measures could limit
gains.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, a basket of major trading
partner currencies, slid 0.55 percent.
 Commodities, which are priced in the U.S. currency on
international markets, rose, as they often do when the dollar
falls.
 U.S. Treasury yields reached their highest levels in a
month as risk aversion was lifted after Greece's austerity
measures were approved. A $29 billion sale of new 7-year notes
also drew weak demand, the third consecutive soft auction. Most
analysts attributed weakness to optimism over Greece, rather
than fundamental fears over U.S. debt.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 21/32, its yield at 3.1118 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was unchanged, yielding 0.474 percent.
The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 26/32, its
yield at 4.3747 percent.
 Spot gold  traded up to $1510.40, just below an
intraday high of $1,512.31, countering losses earlier in the
week that took the price below $1,500. COMEX gold  rose
0.61 percent to $1,509.4.
 Gold usually gains in periods of greater investor worry,
but the Greek debt crisis and its impact on the euro have
caused bullion to act less as a safe-haven asset and more as a
commodity.
 Copper hit its highest in nearly two months, with
three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange  closing
up 2.7 percent at $9,320 a tonne from $9,072.50 at the close on
Tuesday, its highest since May 4, aided by buying related to
technical factors.
 Demand for the safety of German debt receded, at least
temporarily, after the approval of the Greek austerity plan.
 The cost of insuring against a Greek default was unchanged
after the package was passed, and ING models showed investors
still expect to receive only 60 percent of the face value of
any three-year Greek bonds they hold to maturity.
 The spread between Greek government debt and German
benchmark Bunds  narrowed to 13.614,
from 13.709 percent on Tuesday.

 By Wanfeng Zhou and Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Wednesday after Greece's parliament approved
austerity measures needed to avoid a default, but whether the
government can implement them could limit the currency's
gains.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou won a parliamentary
majority in favor of a five-year austerity plan on Wednesday,
clearing a major hurdle in Greece's bid to win access to
international funding. For more see [ID:nLDE75S16H]
 Expectations of a positive outcome had buoyed the euro this
week and pushed it to a two-week high of $1.4449  on
trading platform EBS earlier in the session.
 Greece's government must now win approval on Thursday for
legislation detailing specific implementation measures for the
28-billion-euro austerity package.
 ""The immediate reaction to the news seems to be a little
bit of 'buy the rumor, sell the fact' type of reaction,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
 ""To some extent, investors have realized that this doesn't
necessarily change the bigger picture for Greece or the euro
zone. There are still a lot of questions about the effective
implementation of austerity measures, given the backdrop of
increasing public anger in Greece.""
 The euro was last at $1.4426, up 0.4 percent, with traders
citing an options barrier with offers to sell at $1.4450. It
had jumped 0.8 percent to 1.2048 Swiss francs ,
moving away from a record low around 1.1808 set on Monday.
 The European Union and International Monetary Fund have
insisted Greece pass both bills before disbursing the next
12-billion-euro tranche of Greece's bailout program.
 The euro could find some support from interest-rate
differentials as the European Central Bank is widely expected
to raise rates in early July.
 Recent comments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
underscore that the ECB is still on course to hike rates next
week, according to Marc Chandler, global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 ""The recent string of U.S. economic data has been
relatively soft, and there is some downside risk to next week's
U.S. employment data.""
 ADP's private payrolls data and the Labor Department's
nonfarm payrolls report will be released on Wednesday and
Friday next week, respectively. Both could sway market
sentiment.
 The Greek vote may offer a better opportunity to be long
euros by early-mid next week, Chandler said.
 ""However, over the slightly longer-term, the European debt
crisis is far from resolved, and the problems in Spain and
Italy need to be monitored closely,"" he said.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 80.84 yen , while it
lost 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies <.DXY>,
reaching 74.678.
 A spike in oil prices lifted commodity-linked currencies,
with the Australian , Canadian  and New Zealand
 dollars all trading more than 1 percent higher versus
the U.S. currency.

 U.S. crude oil jumped $1.93, or 2.08 percent, to $94.82 per

Greek default would derail the global economic recovery and
after industry data showed big draws in U.S. crude and gasoline
stocks.

 U.S. Treasuries continued their sell-off into a third day,
and yields rose to their highest in a month after a $29 billion
auction of seven-year notes. It was the third of three auctions
this week, with new coupon issuance totaling $99 billion.
 Seven-year notes  fell 22/32 in price to yield
2.42 percent, the highest since the end of May after the

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was

 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for the
third straight day and oil prices jumped on Wednesday after
Greece's parliament approved the first of two austerity
measures aimed at preventing the country from going bankrupt.
 Safe-haven assets lost some of their appeal as Greek Prime
Minister George Papandreou won a key battle to ensure the
disbursement of a 12 billion euro tranche from a bailout
program the country needs to avoid default next month.
 ""Risk seems to be back in the market after weeks of
risk-off. That's helping the equities move higher,"" said Eric
Marshall, director of research at Hodges Capital Management in
Dallas.
 Greece's government must now win approval on Thursday for
legislation detailing specific implementation measures for its
28 billion euro austerity package. Wednesday's vote clears a
major hurdle in its bid to win access to international funding
to avoid a default in mid-July. For more, see: [ID:nL6E7HT0PS]
 The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> climbed
1.42 percent in its third session of gains. In Europe, the
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top shares hit its highest
close in two weeks, jumping 1.65 percent.
 Major Wall Street indexes were higher on the Greek
austerity plan vote and a mildly encouraging report on pending
U.S. home sales.
 Pending home sales rose a stronger-than-expected 8.2
percent in May, but a glut of unsold properties remained a drag
on the housing market. The latest data followed a mildly
encouraging housing report on Tuesday. [ID:nN1E75R1XG]
 Equities have rallied on optimism the Greece program would
pass, with the S&P up more than 2 percent so far this week.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 87.71
points, or 0.72 percent, at 12,276.40. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 11.72 points, or 0.90 percent, at
1,308.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 15.57
points, or 0.57 percent, at 2,744.88.
 U.S. crude oil jumped $2.09, or 2.25 percent, to $94.98 per
barrel as the Greek parliament vote eased fears that a possible
Greek default would derail the global economic recovery and
after industry data showed big draws in U.S. crude and gasoline
stocks.
 The euro  was up 0.39 percent at $1.4424 against the
dollar and near the session peak of $1.4447 on expectations the
second Greek vote will pass on Thursday.
 U.S. Treasuries continued their sell-off into a third day
and yields rose to their highest in a month after a $29 billion
auction of seven-year notes. It was the third of three auctions
this week, with new coupon issuance totaling $99 billion.
 Seven-year notes  were last down 22/32 in price
to yield 2.42 percent, the highest since the end of May.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 23/32, its yield at 3.1192 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, yielding 0.485 percent.
The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 20/32, with
the yield at 4.3634 percent.
 Spot gold  traded at $1,507.9 an ounce, just below an
intraday high of $1,512.31, countering losses earlier in the
week that took the price below $1,500. COMEX gold  rose
0.59 percent to $1,508.9.
 Gold usually gains in periods of greater investor aversion,
but the Greek debt crisis and its impact on the euro have
caused bullion to act less as a safe-haven asset and more as a
commodity.
 Demand for the safety of German debt receded, at least
temporarily, after the approval of the Greek austerity plan.
 The cost of insuring against a Greek default was unchanged
after the austerity package was passed and ING models showed
investors still expect to receive only 60 percent of the face
value of any three-year Greek bonds they hold to maturity.
 The spread between Greek government debt and German
benchmark Bunds  narrowed 9.5 basis
points to 13.614, from 13.709 percent on Tuesday.

 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for the
third straight day while oil prices jumped on Wednesday after
Greece's parliament approved a five-year austerity plan
designed to prevent the country from going bankrupt.
 Much of those gains were fading, however, as investors
pocketed part of the profits accumulated in the past few days.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Wednesday after Greece's parliament approved
austerity measures needed to avoid a default, though concern
over whether the government can implement them could limit
gains.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou won a parliamentary
majority in favor of a five-year austerity plan on Wednesday,
clearing a major hurdle in debt-strapped Greece's bid to win
access to international funding. For more see [ID:nLDE75S16H].
 The euro last traded at $1.4385, still up 0.1 percent on
the day but off a two-week high of $1.4449  set
earlier on trading platform EBS.
 ""The immediate reaction to the news seems to be a little
bit of 'buy the rumor, sell the fact' type of reaction,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
 ""To some extent, investors have realized that this doesn't
necessarily change the bigger picture for Greece or the euro
zone. There are still a lot of questions about the effective
implementation of austerity measures given the backdrop of
increasing public anger in Greece.""
 Greece's government must now win approval on Thursday for
legislation detailing specific implementation measures for the
28-billion-euro austerity package.
 The European Union and International Monetary Fund have
insisted Greece pass both Wednesday's 28-billion-euro austerity
law and Thursday's specific legislation to implement it before
disbursing the next 12-billion-euro tranche of Greece's bailout
program the country needs to avoid bankruptcy next month.
 The dollar fell to a session low against the yen after the
news, last trading at 80.65 yen, down 0.6 percent on the day.
It had fallen as low as 80.54 yen .
 Wariness about the outlook for the euro remained evident in
the options market, with risk reversals continuing to show
strong demand for bets on euro weakness against the dollar.
 The 25-delta euro/dollar risk reversal 
traded around 2.55 in favor of euro puts, well above a level of
around 1.3 in early June.
 Maurice Pomery, managing director at Strategic Alpha, which
advises banks and hedge funds on currencies, said global macro
investors are likely to continue to be ""extraordinarily wary of
investing in the euro zone for a long time.""
 ""Greece is still facing massive headwinds and this deal is
really only buying time. The medium-term outlook for the euro
will depend on whether the government can implement the
measures.""

 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Equities gained strongly and the
euro rose on Wednesday as investors bet on the ability of
Greece's government to pass new austerity measures designed to
prevent the country from going bankrupt.	
 Wall Street looked set to join in the rally.	
 A positive vote later in the day is essential for Greece to
obtain new funding from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund to help to manage its huge debt burden.	
 ""A lot of work has been done behind the scenes to ensure
that the proposals get passed, and that optimism is getting
reflected,"" said Graham Bishop, equity strategist at RBS.	
 European shares were up 1.5 percent heading for
their third day of gains in a row.	
 Globally, the MSCI all-country world stock index
gained 0.9 percent and Japan's Nikkei
closed up 1.5 percent.	
 In a boost to embattled Prime Minister George Papandreou,
one of three rebel deputies from his ruling Socialist party
backtracked and said he would support the austerity plan.	
 Meanwhile, Greek central bank Governor and European Central
Bank policymaker George Provopoulos warned that a ""no"" vote
would be ""suicide"" for Greece.	
 Greece has around 345 billion euros-worth of outstanding
government debt. Its 10-year bonds are yielding
more than 16.5 percent, indicating that future borrowing costs
would be prohibitive.	
 The fear among policy makers and investors is that a default
by Greece would rapidly spread to other peripheral euro zone
economies, into banks through losses, and ultimately across the
world in the same way as the 2007-8 credit crisis.	
 There remains little confidence, however, that Wednesday's
vote will do much more than ease the situation temporarily.	
 ""The Greek plan is largely expected to be passed by its
parliament. But even when this hurdle is cleared the long-term
outlook remains unclear,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign
exchange at State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.	
 
 EURO FIRMS	
 The euro shrugged off earlier weakness to stand 0.4 percent
higher against the dollar at just above $1.44 .	
 It was lifted by both the prospect of a Greek ""yes"" vote and
prospects for further interest rate hikes in the euro zone.
Comments by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
were interpreted by markets as signalling a July interest rate
rise. 
 Traders said a positive outcome in the vote could push the
euro towards $1.4500, though concerns about whether Greece can
implement the measures would remain.
   ""If the Greece vote is passed there is some upside potential
for the euro, though this is more based on weakness in the U.S.
economy and expectations for a euro zone rate hike next week,""
said Mic Ingenuus, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.	
 Core euro zone government bond prices fell and demand for
peripheral debt rose.	
 ""A relief rally will be short-lived but relief there will
be,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, rate strategist at RIA Capital
Markets.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro struggled to
extend gains in Asia on Wednesday as investors hesitated to buy
it further on the Greek parliament's expected acceptance of an
austerity package, while the market was wary about the long-term
outlook for the euro zone's debt problems.	
 Sentiment towards the euro was lifted by comments by
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, which
markets interpreted as signalling a July interest rate hike,
also helping shore up the common currency. 
 Still, investors were careful about taking additional buying
positions as the euro shied away from $1.4400 hit the previous
day, a level near its 55-day moving average of around $1.4401.	
 ""We're trying to figure out what to do next. The themes now
are votes in Greece and a rate hike in Europe, but from the way
it looks today the market is not too confident about buying the
euro too strongly,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign
exchange at State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.	
 ""The Greek plan is largely expected to be passed by its
parliament. But even when this hurdle is cleared the long-term
outlook remains unclear. We've seen Greece's debt problem
deteriorate about a year ago and the problem is still in place.
For now I don't see much room for the euro to rise from here,""
he said.	
 The euro inched down 0.1 percent to $1.4365 after
slipping to an intraday low of $1.4338. It had reach an one-week
high of $1.4397 the previous day, rebounding from this week's
low of around $1.4100.	
 Still, the euro retained gains against other currencies in
Asia from the previous day. 
 Against the Swiss franc it stood at 1.1932 francs
, holding above a record low around 1.1800 hit on
Monday.	
 ""Some of the EUR's strength stems from Trichet comments
Tuesday that appeared both upbeat and confident on the eve of
the Greek votes,"" Societe Generale analysts wrote in a note.	
 ""Importantly for EUR/USD, the ECB president repeated the
'strong vigilance' phrase, stressing that a hike will be coming
next month if the Greek government wins this week's votes.""	
 The Greek parliament will debate the austerity package from
0700 GMT and vote on it later in the day. On Thursday it will
vote on a separate implementation law spelling out the fiscal
measures in more detail. 
 The euro's rebound saw the dollar index , which tracks
the greenback's performance against a basket of major
currencies, fall back to around 75.002, off this week's peak of
75.987.	
 Oil prices  firmed on optimism about Greece, lifting
commodities currencies such as the Australian dollar from its
recent lows.	
 The Aussie dollar was at $1.0561, well off an
11-week trough just below $1.0400 plumbed on Monday.	
 Against the yen, the dollar rose to an overnight high of
81.26 as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields prompted flows
into the U.S. currency.	
 Still, the dollar edged down in Asia on sales by Japanese
exporters and foreign margin traders, Tokyo dealers said.	
 ""We've seen a typical risk-on situation with both the dollar
and the yen put under selling pressure. In such a situation
dollar/yen benefited from a rise in long-term Treasury yields,""
said Tohru Sasaki, the head of Japan rates and forex research at
JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo.	
 ""It's hard to tell whether the current mood of taking risk
will continue. We still have to look at the outcome of Greece's
vote today,"" Sasaki said.	
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 81.06 yen after
falling to an Asian session low of 80.93 yen.

 SINGAPORE, June 29 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose, with
Japanese stocks hitting a seven-week high, and the euro clung to
gains on Wednesday on optimism the risk is decreasing slightly
that Greece will be the first euro zone country to default on
its debt.	
 There was increased demand for riskier assets such as
equities and commodities, and financial bookmakers predicted
major European indexes would open around 0.5 percent higher.

 ""There's some cautious optimism ahead of the Greek votes
this week,"" said Hiroaki Osakabe, a fund manager at Chibagin
Asset Management in Tokyo.	
 ""But we're also seeing a lot of month-end window dressing
and portfolio tweaking by hedge fund managers ahead of the end
of their first-half earnings report.""	
 Japan's Nikkei rose 1.5 percent and MSCI's index of
Asia Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.2
percent, led by a 2.2 percent rise for the materials sector.

 Sentiment was also buoyed by gains of more than 1 percent in
U.S. markets overnight, though low volumes indicated underlying
nervousness there. 
 
 
 The first vote on Greece's five-year austerity plan was due
later on Wednesday, with further technical votes expected on
Thursday.	
 The package, which has provoked violent demonstrations on
the streets of Athens but won crucial political support on
Tuesday, is needed to secure a new tranche of EU/IMF funds to
prevent Greece becoming the first developed nation in more than
60 years to default on its debts. 
 Some analysts cautioned that any respite was likely to be
temporary, with many doubts remaining over whether Greece can
ever repay its 340 billion euro debt mountain and European
leaders can stop other countries from slipping deeper into
crisis.	
 ""Greece cannot be salvaged,"" Viktor Shvets, head of research
and chief strategist at Samsung Securities Asia, told Reuters
Insider TV.	
 ""Neither, for that matter, can Portugal, Ireland, Spain and
potentially Italy, at the end of the day they might need to exit
the euro, but for the time being, at least in the short to
medium term, the crisis is largely passed.""	
 
 RATE DIFFERENTIAL	
 The euro bought around $1.4362, having risen close to
$1.44 in U.S. trading hours, well above this week's trough
around $1.41.	
 ""Traders should be careful of sharp euro volatility ahead of
what promises to be a contentious vote that may decide whether
Greece avoids default,"" said David Rodríguez, strategist at
DailyFX. 
 The single currency was also supported by comments from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet that were
interpreted as signalling a July interest rate rise.

 Trichet told a news conference the ECB was in ""very strong
vigilance mode"", a phrase that has regularly been used in the
past to point to a rate rise at the next monthly meeting.	
 The ECB began tightening policy in April to head off
inflationary pressures, widening the yield differential with the
dollar as the U.S. Federal Reserve continued to hold rates at a
historic low near zero.	
 
 RISK ON, RISK OFF	
 In recent months, markets have flipped between so-called
""risk-on"" and ""risk-off"" modes -- with the former seeing the
dollar sold in favour of stocks, commodities and
commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and Canadian
dollars, and the latter prompting a return to the dollar and
Treasuries.	
 ""We've seen a typical risk-on situation with both the dollar
and the yen put under selling pressure. In such a situation,
dollar/yen benefited from a rise in long-term Treasury yields,""
said Tohru Sasaki, the head of Japan rates and forex research at
JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. 
""It's hard to tell whether the current mood of taking risk
will continue. We still have to look at the outcome of Greece's
vote today,"" Sasaki said. 
The dollar edged down to around 81.05 yen , from an
overnight high of 81.26. 
 The flow of money back to equities and commodities reduced
demand for safe-haven government debt, with Japanese government
bonds falling, following a similar dip in U.S. Treasuries.	
 September 10-year JGB futures <2JGBv1> fell 0.26 point,
while the benchmark 10-year yield rose 3 basis
points to 1.115 percent.	
 U.S. crude oil  was steady just below $93 a barrel,
after rising more than 2 percent on Tuesday, and spot gold
edged up to around $1,505 an ounce.	
 ""Any positive compromise within Europe, with Greece willing
to make some sacrifices, will cause the euro and oil to rally,""
said Jeremy Friesen, a commodity strategist at Societe Generale.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - World stocks jumped about 1
percent and the euro rose on Tuesday on hopes an impending vote
on Greece's budget and a France-led plan to roll over Greek
debt will save Greece from what would be the first sovereign
default in the euro zone.
 As investors flocked to riskier assets like equities and
commodities, the Treasury's five-year note auction faced lower
demand, which sent U.S. debt prices slumping.
 U.S. and European stocks rose as optimism grew that the
Greek parliament would adopt a fiscal austerity plan needed in
exchange for critical financial aid from international lenders,
despite violent street protests in Athens. For details, see
[ID:nL6E7HS2BG]
 ""The negative reaction that you're getting from the public
is a sign that the parliament is likely to vote in favor of the
austerity plan,"" said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco.
 In Athens, hooded youths throwing stones and wielding
sticks set fire to garbage bins and a telecoms truck outside
Parliament and riot police fired tear gas to disperse them as
the Parliament prepared to vote on Wednesday and Thursday on
the controversial austerity plan. Trade unions began a 48-hour
strike against the EU/IMF-imposed measures. [ID:nLDE75R0FD]
 ""All eyes will continue to be on situation in Europe as we
go into the second half of the week,"" said Ciaran O'Kelly, head
of U.S. equity trading at Nomura Securities International in
New York. ""The world is watching events in Greece unfold over
the next 48 hours.""
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
rose 145.13 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 12,188.69. The
S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 16.57 points, or 1.29 percent, to
1,296.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 41.03
points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,729.31.
 In an advance indication of earnings season, Nike Inc
 surged 10.1 percent to $89.90 a day after reporting
fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, while orders
suggested robust strength for the future. [ID:nN1E75Q1LR]
 Global shares as measured by MSCI's all-country world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> gained 1.1 percent, while U.S.
dollar-denominated Nikkei futures  rose 1.1 percent.
 The news from Europe lifted the euro against the U.S.
dollar as it reduced the chances of the first sovereign default
in the 17-member euro zone. Gains, however, are expected to be
limited as Greece's access to bailout funds may only delay an
eventual default given the size its debt burden, analysts
said.
 ""We are getting more and more bearish on the euro given
there are larger issues at stake here apart from the Greek
austerity vote,"" said Neal Mellor, currency strategist at Bank
of New York Mellon.
 Hopes on the Greek resolution and the weaker greenback
boosted commodity prices, including crude oil. ICE Brent crude
for August  settled up $2.79 at $108.78 a barrel. U.S.
crude  added $2.28 to settle at $92.89 a barrel.
 Copper  gained 0.9 percent.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices extended losses after a $35
billion five-year note auction ""tailed,"" with its high yield
significantly above the open market yield at the same time.
 ""Today's auction was another disappointment that should
cast a pall over Treasuries for some sessions to come,"" said
William O'Donnell, head of Treasury strategy at RBS Securities
in Stamford, Connecticut, in a note to clients after the
auction.
 The hopes for a resolution to Greece's problems also cut
any safety bid for Treasuries.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 31/32 in price to yield 3.04 percent.
 The Bund future  hit a session low of 126.16 and
last traded down 72 ticks on the day at 126.18.
 The package to be voted on by Greek lawmakers includes
spending cuts, tax increases and privatizations required by
international lenders as a price for further financial aid.
 Euro zone banks and insurers are considering a plan
outlined by French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday under
which private bondholders would reinvest half of the proceeds
of maturing Greek debt in new 30-year bonds paying 5.5 percent
interest plus a bonus linked to Greece's GDP growth rate.
 Rudy Narvas, senior economist at Societe Generale in New
York, said investors should get used to jitters over debt
problems in Greece and other European countries like Portugal
as they are not going anywhere, at least for a while.
 ""Right now we have got a Band-Aid with the current package
and also the French plan, which is on the table for banks,"" he
said, ""but in the end what it really comes down to is, this is
a patch, and we have to look forward to the same thing
occurring possibly in three months.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou and Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday as
investors bet Greece would pass an austerity package needed to
avert a debt default, though traders said uncertainty about a
long-term solution would limit further gains in the currency.
 Tough talk on inflation from European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet also boosted euro demand. Markets
expect the ECB to raise interest rates next month despite the
debt woes in Greece and elsewhere. [ID:nL6E7HS1H4]
 Greece's parliament will vote Wednesday and Thursday on a
package of spending cuts, tax hikes and privatizations required
by international lenders as a condition for further aid.
Without the money, Greece could be bust by next month.
 ""There seems to be a little bit more enthusiasm for the
Greek vote tomorrow,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency
strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. ""The significance of
this would be avoiding an involuntary restructuring of debt in
the coming months.""
 While a voluntary restructuring of Greek debt is possible
in the future, Serebriakov said a 'yes' vote on the austerity
measures would ""remove the worst case scenario for the euro.""
 The euro last rose 0.5 percent to $1.4362 . It hit a
session high after the Portuguese government said it plans to
be scrupulous in meeting terms of a bailout. [ID:nLSB001126].
 Traders said the euro could see a relief rally if the vote
passes, though it could struggle to rise above its June high
just below $1.47.
 The possibility that the austerity plan may be rejected
kept the price of options to sell the euro elevated. Analysts
see the possibility of a fall below the psychological support
level of $1.40 if this happens.
 One-month implied euro/dollar volatility  last
traded around 13 percent. One-month 25-delta euro/dollar risk
reversals , which measure the skew between euro
puts and calls, traded around 2.6 in favor of puts, suggesting
bearish sentiment on the euro.
 ""I think the measures will be passed. Most people do, but
euro puts are expensive on the off chance that they don't go
through,"" said a trader in London.
 The euro climbed to an almost eight-week high of 89.80
pence . Sterling also fell to a 13-month low versus
a currency basket <=GBP>. See [ID:nL6E7HS27P]
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 81.12 yen , while it
fell to a record low of 0.8276 Swiss francs .
 UNCERTAINTY REMAINS
 Analysts said the euro may still have some rough sailing
ahead, though. Investors fear Greece's access to bailout funds
may just delay an eventual default.
 ""It is going to be very, very tight and we are getting more
and more bearish on the euro given there are larger issues at
stake here apart from the Greek austerity vote,"" said Neal
Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 Anti-austerity protests turned violent in Athens on Tuesday
as the European Union warned Greek lawmakers the country faces
immediate default unless they back an unpopular economic plan.
 Progress was meanwhile reported in talks to persuade
European banks and insurers to voluntarily roll over maturing
Greek debt as part of a planned second rescue package designed
to give the euro zone country breathing space. [ID:nWEB7502]

 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied and the

 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher against
the U.S. dollar on Tuesday but further gains looked limited
ahead of a crucial Greek parliament vote on austerity measures
needed to avert the euro zone's first default.
 Greek lawmakers will vote Wednesday and Thursday on a
package of spending cuts, tax increases and privatizations
required by international lenders as a price for further
financial aid.
 While Prime Minister George Papandreou's Socialist
government survived a confidence motion earlier this month with
155 votes in the 300-member parliament, massive protests are
stepping up pressures on lawmakers ahead of the vote.
 ""There's general uncertainty ahead of the vote,"" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York. ""It looks like if it does pass, it might be a slim
majority.""
 The euro last traded at $1.4319 , up 0.2 percent on
the day. Traders said the euro could stay in the $1.41-$1.43
range in the short term, having been unable to break above
$1.4350 in recent sessions.
 The European currency also got a boost from a slight
increase in risk appetite on positive U.S. home prices data and
comments from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet that policymakers were in strong vigilance mode on
inflation.
 Analysts said the euro could see a relief rally if the vote
passes, though it looked set to stay on the defensive as
investors feared that a bailout would only delay an eventual
default given the size of Greece's debt burden.
 ""It is going to be very, very tight and we are getting more
and more bearish of the euro given there are larger issues at
stake here apart from the Greek austerity vote,"" said Neal
Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""The question that is in the markets' mind is 'Will an EU
debt rollover plan be enough to salvage Greece?' The focus will
turn to data and if there are no signs of growth, the political
will to do more on Greece will be very thin.""
 Progress had been made in involving the private sector in
an eventual Greek rescue plan, while European Union officials
were also working on a 'Plan B' if Athens were to reject all or
part of the austerity package, sources told Reuters on Monday.
[ID:nLDE75P0BM]
 EUR/USD IMPLIED VOL
 The possibility that the austerity plan may be rejected
kept the price of options to sell the euro elevated, and
analysts see the possibility of a fall below the psychological
support level of $1.40 if this happens.
 Without approval for the austerity measures, the European
Union and International Monetary Fund say they will not
disburse the fifth tranche of Greece's 110 billion euro bailout
program. Athens needs the aid to pay its bills next month.
 A Greek debt default could possibly spark a Europe-wide
crisis and potential credit market freeze similar to the one
that came after the Lehman Brothers collapse.
 One-month implied euro/dollar volatility  traded
around 13 percent, hovering near 13.7 percent hit on Monday.
 One-month 25-delta euro/dollar risk reversals
, which measure the skew between euro puts and
calls, traded around 2.65 in favor of puts, suggesting bearish
sentiment
 Short-dated Greek bonds  came under pressure
and the cost of insuring Greek debt against default rose.
 ""I think the measures will be passed. Most people do, but
euro puts are expensive on the off chance that they don't go
through,"" said a trader in London.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> was down 0.2 percent at
75.238, sliding below a downward trendline drawn off peaks hit
in June 2010 and January 2011 that now lies near 75.55. Against
the yen, the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 80.79 .
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.8302 Swiss franc
, while sterling hit a 13-month low versus a currency
basket <=GBP>.

 * Euro inches up towards intraday peak near $1.4330
 * Euro faces resistance near $1.4350/60 area
 * Dollar index dips back below 2010 downward trendline

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - The euro inched up on Tuesday as
Asian sovereigns and macro funds bought the common currency on
dips, but traders said gains could lose steam on uncertainty
over whether Greece's parliament will approve austerity steps.	
 The common currency was up 0.3 percent at $1.4321 ,
not far from the day's high of $1.4330 struck in early Asian
trading.	
 But the euro's rise is likely to stall short of resistance
clustered near the $1.4350 to $1.4360 area, with market players
citing talk of euro offers near $1.4320 to $1.4330.	
 One resistance level lies near $1.4362, the 76.4 percent
retracement of the euro's drop from last week's weekly high down
to Monday's $1.4102 low.	
 Greek parliamentary votes on austerity measures expected on
Wednesday and Thursday remained the focus for investors.
Approvals could give the euro a short-term boost, but if the
measures are rejected, the euro could fall past its key
psychological support level of $1.40.	
 ""It is going to be very, very tight and we are getting more
and more bearish of the euro given there are larger issues at
stake here apart from the Greek austerity vote,"" said Neal
Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.	
 ""The question that is in the markets' mind is 'Will an EU
debt rollover plan be enough to salvage Greece?' The focus will
turn to data and if there are no signs of growth, the political
will to do more on Greece will be very thin.""	
 In a move that helped soothe markets, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy said on Monday that French banks had reached a
draft agreement on a voluntary roll-over of maturing Greek bonds
that would stretch out loans over 30 years. 
 But overall sentiment remained cautious as Greece's
fractious lawmakers debated unpopular austerity measures that
are the price of further aid from international lenders.	
 Without approval for the austerity measures, the European
Union and International Monetary Fund say they will not disburse
the fifth tranche of Greece's 110 billion euro bailout
programme. Athens needs the aid to pay its bills next month and
avert the euro zone's first sovereign default.	
 European Central Bank Executive Member Juergen Stark was
cited in media reports as saying that Greece will receive
further financial help only if it sticks to implementing
austerity measures and that there were no alternate plans if the
reforms were not approved.	
 Talk of a 'Plan B' in the event of a failure to pass the
Greek austerity measures has been doing the rounds, offering
some support to the currency. Three euro zone sources told
Reuters on Monday that European Union officials were working on
a contingency plan for Greece in case its parliament rejects the
austerity programme and the country cannot receive the next
instalment of EU/IMF emergency loans.

 NEAR-TERM VIEW	
 Speculators have been cutting bullish bets on the euro, but
Washington's own fiscal problems and steady buying of the single
currency by Asian central banks have been lending it vital
support. 
 ""The market seems to be taking its cues not so much from
whether Greece's problems will be solved or not, but on whether
or not there might be a default in the very near future,"" said
Makoto Noji, senior bond and currency strategist for SMBC Nikko
Securities in Tokyo.	
 Even if Greece averts a default in the near term, its fiscal
problems are unlikely to be resolved, Noji said. 
 ""But if there is no near-term default, hedge funds that
trimmed positions in risky assets could put them back on,"" Noji
said.	
 The dollar index was down 0.26 percent at 75.195,
back below a downward trendline drawn off peaks hit in June 2010
and January 2011 that now lies near 75.55.	
 A clear breach of that resistance and a mid-June high of
76.015 could set the dollar index up for further gains. Above
the mid-June peak, the next major peak on charts is at 76.366, a
high hit in late May.	
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent against the yen to 80.81 yen
. Stiff technical resistance near 81 yen as well as
dollar-selling by Japanese exporters, helped weigh on the
dollar, market players said.

dissipates 
 * Euro edges lower	
 * U.S. futures point to weak Wall Street open 
 
 By Sujata Rao	
 LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - World stocks gave up early gains
on Tuesday to hover around flat while the euro also fell ahead
of crucial votes in the Greek parliament over austerity measures
needed to stave off a debt default.	
 Wall Street looked set for a weak open, with stock futures
pointing downwards and investors reluctant to take major bets
before the parliamentary votes on Wednesday and Thursday. 
 The austerity measures are required in order for Athens to
receive more European Union and International Monetary Fund aid
but popular opposition to austerity is strong, exemplified by a
two-day general strike launched on Tuesday.	
 While the market had earlier received some support from
France's agreement with its banks to roll over some Greek debt
and talk of a contingency plan if the austerity measures are not
approved, the positive momentum soon dissipated. 
 Market players pointed to further problems down the line for
the euro zone periphery.	
 ""The question that is in the markets' mind is 'Will an EU
debt rollover plan be enough to salvage Greece?' The focus will
turn to data and if there are no signs of growth, the political
will to do more on Greece will be very thin,"" said Neal Mellor,
currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. 
 World shares as measured by MSCI were flat
as was the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares. The latter was also hit by a 15 percent slump in telecom
giant Cable & Wireless after a profit warning.	
 Greek shares however rose 1.5 percent though they
stayed just off 14-year lows hit recently.	
 Japan's Nikkei had earlier closed up three-quarters
of a percent, lifted by the French plan which would see banks
reinvesting 70 percent of proceeds when Greek bonds fall due in
2011-14 and cash out the rest. . 
 But European Central Bank Executive Member Juergen Stark was
cited in media reports as saying that Greece will receive
further financial help only if it sticks to implementing
austerity measures and that there were no alternate plans if the
reforms were not approved. 
 In the United States, S&P500 futures  were down 0.2
percent while Nasdaq  and the Dow Jones  slipped 0.1
percent each. Wall Street had risen on Monday after three
loss-making sessions.

 EURO FIRMER	
 The euro also gave up its early modest gains and traded down
0.1 percent at $1.4272 , off the day's high of $1.4330
struck in early Asian trading. 
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default rose. A
parliamentary nod to the austerity proposals could give the euro
a short-term boost, but if the measures are rejected, the euro
could fall past its key psychological support level of $1.40,
said Tom Levinson, currency strategist at ING. 
 ""The alternative is the unthinkable. Greece's government
would fall, with the wider implication that the euro zone debt
crisis takes a major lurch worse, i.e. towards a Greek default,""
Levinson added.	
 Meanwhile, sterling fell to a 13-month low against a
currency basket , dragged lower by weakness in the pound
versus the euro and dismal UK data which backed expectations
that interest rates will remain low this year. 
 On debt markets, German and U.S. bonds rose with Treasury
futures rebounding from a sell-off in the previous session.	
 The Bund future  was up 3 ticks at 126.93 after
dipping in and out of negative territory in early trade and
after the previous session's 55 ticks sell-off.	
 ""Tomorrow is going to be a decisive day. If they approve the
austerity measures, then we have a chance that the market could
stabilise,"" said Klaus Wiener, chief economist at Generali
Investments, which manages 330 billion euros ($468 billion). 
""If not, we will have turmoil. The core yields will fall even
more, peripheral spreads will widen even more and equities will
lose ground.""

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, June 28 (Reuters) - A rally in Asian shares and
the euro stalled on Tuesday as investors remained worried that
Greece could default on its massive debts despite an outline
agreement by French banks to roll over Greek bonds.	
 The radical French proposal came as the Greek parliament
began debating unpopular austerity measures that are the price
of further aid from international lenders. 
 Rising confidence that the five-year programme would pass
when Greece's fractious lawmakers cast votes on Wednesday and
Thursday had encouraged investors to return to riskier assets
sold off in recent weeks, with U.S. stocks gaining nearly 1
percent on Monday to end a three-day losing streak. 
 European stocks were also expected to bounce, with financial
bookmakers in London calling the major indexes up 0.3-0.6
percent. But an early rally in Asia lost steam, with some
warning the euro zone relief may only be temporary. 
 ""We can't really say Greece can avoid defaulting on its debt
yet,"" says Shinji Nomura, chief fixed-income strategist at SMBC
Nikko Securities.	
 
 Japan's Nikkei , which had been up more than 1
percent in the morning, ended the day 0.7 percent higher. MSCI's
broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
veered between gains and losses, and was up 0.1
percent. Shares in Hong Kong and Singapore were flat. 
 Growing doubts that Greece can repay its 340 billion euro
debt mountain have dragged on financial markets in recent weeks,
with investors fearing a default could spark a re-run of the
panic that engulfed markets after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in 2008.	
 
 LOANS STRETCHED	
 In a move that helped soothe markets, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy announced on Monday that French banks had
reached a draft agreement on a voluntary roll-over of maturing
Greek bonds that would stretch out loans over 30 years.	
 The euro rose above $1.43 on Tuesday, having rallied
from a low near $1.41 on Monday, before easing back to trade
around $1.4270, down a little from late U.S. trade as market
players remained cautious on the outlook for the euro zone.

 ""The market seems to be taking its cues not so much from
whether Greece's problems will be solved or not, but on whether
or not there might be a default in the very near future,"" said
Makoto Noji, senior bond and currency strategist for SMBC Nikko
Securities in Tokyo.	
 Underlining the caution, Japanese government bonds edged up
a little as safe-haven assets remained in demand.	
 Benchmark 10-year JGB futures <2JGBv1> rose 0.04 point,
while the 10-year yield slipped 1 basis point to 1.085 percent.

 Beyond the crisis in Europe, where Ireland and Portugal are
also struggling under the weight of their debts despite EU/IMF
bailouts, there are broader worries about the strength of the
global economy, with growth still weak in much of the developed
world and concerns about a slowdown in China.	
 ""U.S. PMI data to be released later this week will be the
key to watch on whether the global economy can sustain its
momentum,"" said K.H. Lin, a vice president at Yuanta Financial
Holdings' fund unit.	
 Brent crude oil  fell 0.1 percent to $105.84 a barrel
and U.S. crude  eased a fraction to $90.58. 
 Oil prices tumbled last week after Thursday's move by the
International Energy Agency to release 2 million barrels per day
from reserves over 30 days to address the loss of Libya's 1.2
million barrels per day of crude exports.	
 Gold was little changed around $1,497 an ounce, and
copper inched up 0.2 percent.

 NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks snapped a
three-day losing streak and the euro rallied against the dollar
on Monday on increasing confidence the Greek parliament will
pass an unpopular austerity plan, and as French banks outlined
an agreement to roll over Greek debt.
 Treasury prices fell as the developments in Europe lured
investors into riskier assets, while low yields in the U.S.
government's sale of two-year notes discouraged some potential
buyers.
 U.S. stocks rose around 1 percent, leading global shares
higher, with banks among the top gainers after regulators
announced global capital rules that were not as harsh as
previously feared. For details see [ID:nN1E75Q0N3].
 ""We don't see this being the start of a major rally but
this is welcome strength in the market and hopefully a welcome
short-term bottom,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer
of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.
 Greek lawmakers were to begin debating on Monday evening a
28 billion euro ($40 billion) package of measures to increase
taxes and cut fiscal spending that is critical to winning a new
round of international funding to keep the country afloat.
[ID:nLDE75P0BM].
 ""As long as the Greek Parliament votes 'yes' this week on
an austerity plan, stocks are going to go up,"" said Cary
Leahey, economist and managing director at Decision Economics
in New York.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Monday called on
all political parties to back an unpopular five-year austerity
plan, which international lenders have made a condition for
further aid to Greece.
 French banks, among the most exposed to the Greek debt
crisis, have reached an outline agreement to roll over holdings
of maturing Greek bonds. French President Nicolas Sarkozy
confirmed the breakthrough on Monday and German bankers voiced
their interest in the ""French model."" [ID:nL6E7HR0GU]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 108.98
points, or 0.91 percent, to 12,043.56. The S&P 500 <.SPX> added
11.65 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,280.10. The Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> jumped 35.39 points, or 1.33 percent, to
2,688.28.
 The S&P financial index <.GSPF> ended up 1.1 percent and an
index of large U.S. bank stocks <.BKX> rose 1.4 percent.
 Ghriskey, of Solaris, said financials were ""a very oversold
group"" that was due for a bounce.
 On Saturday, global banking regulators in Basel agreed that
the biggest banks globally will need to boost their ratios of
common equity to risk-weighted assets by up to 2.5 percentage
points, less than the 3 percentage points some investors had
feared. [ID:nLDE75O053]
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
0.4 percent for the day. U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures
 rose 0.5 percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares provisionally closed up 0.1 percent at 1,074.82.
 Treasuries fell as shrinking worries over a Greek default
reduced safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt. A sale of
two-year notes with a yield of less than half a percent further
discouraged buyers.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  were off
14/32 in price to yield 2.92 percent, up from Friday's 2.87
percent.
 ""It was a relatively weak auction, almost certainly because
two-year rates are within shouting distance of the all-time
rate lows set in November 2010,"" RBS head of Treasury strategy
William O'Donnell said in a note to clients.
 EURO UP, OIL WEAK
 The euro rallied against the U.S. dollar as investors
became optimistic the austerity vote will pass in the Greek
parliament and the euro zone member can avoid a default on its
debt.
 The euro had been swinging between gains and losses
throughout the global session, responding to each headline or
market rumor on the Greek vote, traders said.
 ""I think the vote will pass or we would be seeing a huge
sell-off,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at
GFT Forex in New York. ""The fate of the euro/dollar hinges on
the outcome of the vote.""
 The single currency  was last at $1.4276, up 0.6
percent on the day, and well off the session low of $1.4101,
according to Reuters data. The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of
the greenback against major currencies, fell 0.4 percent.
 U.S. crude oil futures  continued to slide on worries
about economic growth in the United States and as China
admitted it would struggle to keep inflation in check this
year. Brent futures  were up in a volatile session,
supported by weakness in the U.S. currency.
 Brent crude futures settled 87 cents higher at $105.99 a
barrel and U.S. light crude futures settled down 55 cents to
$90.61 a barrel.
 Gold prices fell for a third session as investors bet that
Greece would avoid default. U.S. gold futures for August
delivery  settled down $4.50 an ounce at $1,496.40, after
trading between $1,490.80 and $1,506.10.

 EURO UP, OIL WEAK
 The euro rallied against the U.S. dollar as investors
became optimistic the austerity vote will pass in Greece's
parliament and the euro zone member can avoid a default on its
debt.
 The euro had been swinging between gains and losses
throughout the global session, responding to each headline or
market rumor on the Greek vote, traders said.
 ""I think the vote will pass or we would be seeing a huge
sell-off,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at
GFT Forex in New York. ""The fate of the euro/dollar hinges on
the outcome of the vote.""
 The single currency  was last at $1.4273, up 0.6
percent on the day, and well off the session low of $1.4101,
according to Reuters data.
 U.S. crude oil futures  continued to slide in the
aftermath of the International Energy Agency's surprise release
of 60 million barrels of oil to rein in prices. Brent futures
 were last up in a volatile session, supported by
weakness in the U.S. currency.
 Brent crude futures were 85 cents higher at $105.97 a
barrel by 1838 GMT, with the session low at $102.28. U.S. light
crude futures fell 56 cents to $90.60 a barrel, after touching
lows of $89.61 earlier.

 NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday as
investors bet Greece's parliament would approve a fiscal
austerity package needed for the country to receive emergency
aid and avoid defaulting on its debt.
 A French plan aimed at sorting out how banks will roll over
Greek loans to help the troubled euro zone country stay solvent
also boosted the currency, which climbed as high as $1.4293
after hitting an overnight low around $1.41. [ID:nLDE75P0BM]
 ""The euro is still seems to be topping out around $1.43 and
we're still negative on it in the longer run, but market
expectations are the austerity plan will be voted in,"" said
Mogens Hauschildt, senior dealer at Western Union Business
Solutions in White Rock, British Columbia.
 An initial vote on Greece's 28 billion euro package of
unpopular spending cuts and tax increases is due on Wednesday.
Lawmakers then vote on Thursday on a separate bill containing
specific steps to implement it. [ID:nLDE75P0BM].
 Greece must agree to the plan to obtain its next slice of
international aid needed to make debt payments.
 Hauschildt said the euro could spike to $1.45 if the
package wins approval but would likely retreat from there, as
it remains vulnerable to fiscal woes in Spain and Portugal.
 Paresh Upadhyaya, senior currency strategist at
BofA-Merrill Lynch, added: ""It could be a
buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact situation. It looks a safe bet they
will pass the measures but a weaker euro after that would not
surprise me.""
 The euro was last up 0.6 percent at $1.4272  and rose
1.2 percent to 115.41 yen . The dollar added 0.6
percent to 80.91 yen  and was up 0.4 percent to 0.8365
Swiss francs .
 CHOPPY TRADE
 Earlier, the euro fell firmly into the red after Moody's
said Greek banks have lost about 8 percent of private-sector
customer deposits so far this year. The ratings agency warned
that they would face severe cash shortages if outflows mount to
35 percent of their deposits. For more see [ID:nN1E75Q0CR].
 Rising U.S. stock indexes helped the euro recover, though,
and traders said Middle East names bought it on dips.
 Analysts said the euro remains vulnerable to selling on any
comments from European officials that may cast doubt on the
Greek ballot's outcome.
 ""Clearly, the volatility out there suggests people are very
nervous,"" said Steven Butler, head of trading at Scotia Capital
in Toronto. ""I think trade will continue to be very choppy, and
if the euro gets into the low $1.43s, that would be an area to
sell.""
 The possibility of a Greek default has raised concerns
about the health of the European financial system and whether
it can withstand such a credit event. Such worries triggered a
sell-off in Italian banking shares late last week.
 Overall, the dollar has benefited from broad risk aversion
stemming from the ongoing euro zone debt crisis, as investors
have cut back on short positions in the U.S. currency.[IMM/FX]
 ""The fortunes of the USD will be determined largely by the
'not being the EUR,' capitalizing on any bad news and
retreating when the market gets more hopeful,"" Credit Agricole
analysts said in a note.

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - The euro recovered from early
losses on Monday as investors covered short positions after
broad selling last week, but gains were capped on concerns about
Greece's ability to repay its debt even if austerity measures
are passed.	
 Sovereign demand lifted the euro above $1.42, but the single
currency teetered near a record trough versus the Swiss franc as
Greece's parliament opened a debate on harsh fiscal measures
before a vote expected on Thursday. 
 Analysts said the euro would be vulnerable to any comments
from Greek or other European officials which may cast doubt on
the ballot's outcome, though most believe the austerity measures
will be approved and give the euro a short-term boost.	
 ""People are looking at the way the Greek government
confidence vote went through last week, which suggests that the
austerity vote will go through too,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at nabCapital.	
 ""The euro could squeeze higher, though it will be capped
initially below $1.4340"". 
 He pointed to concerns about whether the Greek austerity
measures will get cross-party support and whether a long-term
solution to Greece's debt problems can be found as reasons for
euro gains being limited.	
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.4207, well above an
earlier session low of $1.4102. It hit a high for the day at
$1.4237 as demand from sovereign entities pushed the currency
through reported stop loss orders above $1.4180.	
 Traders scrambled to cover short positions after the euro
took a beating last week due to jitters that domestic turmoil in
Greece may threaten the country's chances of obtaining more
bailout funds.	
 Technical analysts said the single currency needed to close
above its 100-day moving average around $1.4195, a key
resistance level, to ensure a sustained rise higher.	
 A fall below $1.4073 would take it to a one-month low and
leave it targeting the 200-week moving average around $1.4019.	
 The short squeeze in the euro lifted it slightly against the
Swiss franc. It traded at 1.1843 francs but hovered
very near a lifetime low of 1.1808 francs, after a dramatic
rally in the safe-haven Swiss unit since April.	
 ""If they (Greece) pass the measures it will all be very well
but the problem will be in implementing the policy, and if you
just push the problem back two or three months, we'll find
ourselves in the exact same position in time,"" said Chris
Walker, currency strategist at UBS.	
 He said the bank's flows showed real money investors and
speculators were significant sellers of euros in the past week.
He said the euro could fall to $1.35 in the second half of 2011
due to euro zone debt issues and a gloomier global outlook.	
 
 DOLLAR SUPPORTED	
 The possibility of a Greek default has raised concerns about
the health of the European financial system and whether it can
withstand such a credit event. Such worries triggered a sell-off
in Italian banking shares late last week.	
 Overall, the dollar has benefited from broad risk aversion
stemming from the euro zone debt crisis, as investors have been
cutting back on short positions in the U.S. currency. 
 Versus a currency basket the dollar slipped slightly
to 75.570. But it hovered near 76.00, and a decisive break above
there would take it to its highest in a month. Versus the yen
, the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 80.74 yen.	
 But analysts warned investors were concerned the struggling
U.S. economy is far from stable, while Washington suffers from
its own fiscal problem as it approaches its debt ceiling again,
which could haunt the dollar in the longer term.	
 ""The fortunes of the USD will be determined largely by the
mood in the euro zone, as the USD is now fulfilling the role of
""not being the EUR"", capitalising on any bad news and retreating
when the market gets more hopeful,"" Credit Agricole analysts
said in a note.	
 ""This has lent it more of a safe-haven status recently in
relation to peripheral stories, but its reaction to softer US
data remains ambiguous.""

 LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Investors went on the defensive
on Monday ahead of a Greek austerity vote that may sow stronger
doubts about financial stability and economic recovery.	
 Wall Street looked set to rise at the open and European
shares managed some cautious gains. But stock market volatility
in Europe hit a 14-week high.	
 Earlier jitters were eased slightly by comments suggesting
France was making progress on how to involve bondholders in a
Greek rescue deal.	
 Greek lawmakers will begin debating a 28 billion euro ($40
billion) package of measures to increase taxes and cut fiscal
spending that is critical to winning a new round of
international funding to keep it afloat. 
 A rejection of the austerity plan could greatly worsen
pressures already reflected by rising Portuguese and Spanish
government bond yields, possibly bringing high-risk Europe
closer to a chain of sovereign defaults that would blow out
interbank funding costs and place heavy stress on the region's
banking system.	
 The risk of a credit event of this magnitude is keeping
two-year U.S. interest rate swap spreads near the widest in a
year and helping to lift the U.S. dollar out of a downtrend that
has lasted a year.	
 ""If the government wins, there would be some bounce in
shares. But it does not change the long-term story. Greece's
finances are pretty unsustainable and until it starts dealing
with its ability to raise funding internally by more efficient
tax collection, investors will continue to be nervous,"" said
Felicity Smith, fund manager at Bedlam Asset Management.	
 ""Investors are more concerned about its effect on the
banking system. If there is a disorderly default, then there is
a real risk of another Lehman-style shock and its knock-on
effects on other peripheral euro zone countries,"" she said.	
 
 EURO WEAK	
 The euro recovered early losses after struggling near a
record low against the Swiss franc and was slightly stronger
against dollar.	
 ""Most investors expect Greece's vote to get through, but
they still want to lighten their positions in the euro to remove
risk as there is a great deal of uncertainty,"" said Daisuke
Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank. 
 The euro, which plumbed a record low against the Swiss franc
around 1.1800 on Friday, was last around 1.1853
francs. 
 Against the dollar, the euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4214
after dropping as far as $1.4102 -- its lowest since June
16.	
 Yields on core euro zone government bonds were slightly
higher.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, June 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose for a
fourth consecutive session and equities fell on Monday, with
investors nervous ahead of a Greek vote on unpopular austerity
measures this week that may sow stronger doubts about financial
stability in Europe.	
 Greek lawmakers began debating a 28 billion euro ($40
billion) package of measures to increase taxes and cut fiscal
spending that is critical to winning a new round of
international funding to keep it afloat. 
 A rejection of the austerity plan could greatly worsen
pressures already reflected by rising Portuguese and Spanish
government bond yields, possibly bringing high-risk Europe
closer to a chain of sovereign defaults that would blow out
interbank funding costs and place heavy stress on the region's
banking system.	
 The risk of a credit event of this magnitude is keeping
two-year U.S. interest rate swap spreads near the widest in a
year and helping to lift the U.S. dollar out of a downtrend that
has lasted a year. 
 ""Contagion would run through government bond markets and via
interbank funding markets,"" said Societe Generale economists
about the implications of a ""no"" vote from Greece. ""Such a
negative scenario would threaten not only the financial
stability of the euro area, but the global financial system with
severe consequences for the global economy."" 
 In the background, the world's major economies are at a
vulnerable stage, as growth is slowing but inflation remains
high or even accelerating in some places, eroding returns on
investments and leaving investors unwilling to take many risks.

 The U.S. ISM index of factory activity due on Friday may
show to what extent the slowdown is temporary.	
 CONTAGION AND DISARRAY	
 The U.S. dollar index, which measures its value against six
other major currencies, was trading above a downward trendline
that began in June 2010. It was up 0.3 percent on the day to
75.87 , on track for a fourth straight session of gains,
having risen around 4 percent since May.	
 The euro slid to $1.4128, down 0.4 percent and within
striking distance of the June low of $1.4070 . 
""Markets understand that if this package isn't passed this
week, it's going to throw European debt markets into disarray
and cause global contagion. That fear alone is generating a bit
of selling today,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland in Sydney.	
 Treasuries gained, with the benchmark 10-year yield slipping
to a seven-month low of 2.84 percent .	
 In shorter maturities, the two-year swap spread over the
cash market was at 28.5 basis points, not far from Friday's 29.3
basis points, the widest since July 2010. 
 U.S. S&P 500 index futures were down 0.2 percent ,
suggesting a lower open on Wall Street. The cash market, which
closed at 1,268.45 on Friday, was at risk of testing its 200-day
moving average which is about five points below there.	
 A further break below the 2011 low in March of 1,249.05
would probably attract more selling.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average closed down 1 percent ,
with technology equipment makers the biggest drag on the index. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was
down 0.9 percent , with technology and
commodity-related shares the biggest losers.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.7 percent , though
the China Enterprises index of mainland stocks bounced
from intraday lows after posting the biggest daily percentage
gain in a year on Friday.	
 Asia is home to some of the most well-capitalised banks in
the world, though investors kept selling shares of Chinese
banks, many of whom are trading at single-digit
price-to-earnings ratios based on 12-month expectations, Thomson
Reuters StarMine showed.	
 China Construction Bank's Hong Kong-listed shares were down
0.9 percent , underperforming the broad market, and
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China was down 0.3 percent
.	
 The financial sector globally was trading at 9.5 times its
12-month forecasts for earnings, the second cheapest valuation
of all the sectors, right in front of energy stocks. 
 U.S. crude kept a bearish trend in place, with the August
future falling 0.9 percent to $90.26 a barrel , near last
Thursday's four-month low of $89.69. Brent futures were down 1.6
percent to $103.41 .	
 Commodities have been the weakest link among asset classes
vulnerable to a selloff in the face of slowing in industrial
activity globally. Oil prices have been slashed by a fifth since
May.

 SINGAPORE, June 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose and
Asian equities slipped on Monday, with investors positioning
their portfolios ahead of a Greek vote on unpopular fiscal
austerity measures this week and a gauge of U.S. factory
activity that is expected to show slowing growth.	
 Athens will vote on a package of measures to increase taxes
and cut spending on Wednesday and then on specific steps on
Thursday. Passage is critical for international lenders to push
through a new round of funding for Greece so it will avert a
default that could propel volatility in global financial
markets. 
 The black swan event that traders and investors are
grappling with at this point is what if Greece votes no.	
 ""A 'No' would block the much needed next tranche of the
EU/IMF loan of 12 billion euros, leaving big question marks as
to how Greece would fund coupon payments and bond redemptions in
July and August,"" Societe Generale economists said in a note. 
 ""Any help from the EU/IMF would come reluctantly, and there
is a non-negligible risk that a No vote could put Greece in
default."" 
 The world's major economies are at a vulnerable stage, when
growth is slowing but inflation remains high or even
accelerating in some places, eroding returns on investments and
leaving investors unwilling to take many risks. 
 The U.S. ISM index of factory activity due on Friday may
show to what extend the slowdown is temporary.	
 The U.S. dollar index, which measures its value against six
other major currencies, was trading above a downward trendline
that began a year ago. It was up 0.4 percent on the day to 75.96
, having risen 4 percent since May.	
 The euro slid to $1.4112, down a half a percent and within
striking distance of the June low of $1.4070 . 
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.9 percent in
early trade, with technology equipment makers the biggest drag
on the index. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was down
0.9 percent , with commodity-related shares the
biggest losers.	
 U.S. crude kept a bearish trend in place, with the August
futures falling 0.7 percent to $90.57 a barrel , near last
Thursday's four-month low of $89.69.	
 Commodities have been the weakest link among asset classes

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The euro and global stocks
slid on Friday as concerns the Greek parliament may not approve
austerity measures next week that are crucial for securing more
bailout funds outweighed better-than-expected economic data.
 Investors seeking safety drove the yield on the benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note  down to 2.87 percent, a
low last seen in November.
 Two-year notes  gained for an 11th straight week,
the longest rally in more than 30 years.
 ""The only way these yields are justified is if we continue
to have news out of Europe that creates this safe-haven
buying,"" said David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and
trading at Williams Capital in New York.
 ""The economy is sluggish but it's not falling out of bed
and unless it were falling out of bed there would be no
justification for these yields,"" he said.
 The euro fell against the dollar for a third straight
session and touched a new record low against the Swiss franc as
investors bought safe-haven assets. For more, see:

 On Wall Street, stocks fell for a third straight day and
accelerated losses at the session's end, with banks falling on
worries that Greece's debt crisis is deepening.
 The Greek parliament is scheduled to vote on the austerity
plan on Wednesday and Thursday. For a timeline see:
[ID:nLDE75K1EC]
 European shares extended their slide to eight straight
weeks in the longest losing streak since 1998, with Italian
banks tumbling on Greek-related worries.
 ""There's been a flight out of banks, even the stronger
ones,"" said Colin McLean, managing director at SVM Asset
Management in Edinburgh.
 ""There's an increasing feeling in the market that some form
of default in Greece is absolutely necessary. Even if they vote
for austerity, they won't necessarily carry it through.""
 The STOXX Europe 600 Banking Index <.SX7P> of 50 shares

, the euro set a record low of 1.1841.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, a basket of trading partner

 Concerns about the long-simmering European debt crisis
trumped better-than-expected data on durable goods orders in
the United States and German sentiment.
 May durable goods orders rose 1.9 percent after dropping
2.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. Economists
had expected May's orders to rise 1.5 percent.

index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to
114.5 in June from an originally reported 114.2 in May.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The euro dropped against the
dollar for a third straight session on Friday and hit a record
low against the Swiss franc, with more losses expected if
Greece's parliament doesn't approve a package of austerity
measures next week.
 Passage is mandatory for the country to secure more bailout
funds from euro zone governments. If more funds aren't found,
Greece could default on its massive debt, a development that
would roil markets.
 Banks and policymakers moved closer to a deal on Friday.
See [ID:nLDE75M1V1]
 Thomas Robopoulos, a deputy of Greece's ruling PASOK party,
rattled markets when he said he will vote against the mix of
higher taxes, spending cuts, and sales of state-owned assets.
His remarks helped the euro wipe out initial gains made on the
back of a stronger-than-expected survey of German business
sentiment.
 Investors are awaiting the Greek parliament's vote on the
austerity plan on June 29 and 30 before committing to a stance
on the euro's prospects in the coming weeks, said Nick
Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in New
York.
 Investors had earlier cheered the surprisingly strong IFO
reading, which painted a rosier picture of the German economy
compared with a recent run of weak data. [ID:nLDE75NOE4]
 ""The euro is down nonetheless as market participants await
a concrete resolution to the latest phase of the European debt
crisis,"" he said.
 Concerns about Italy also weighed on the euro, with some
Italian bank shares tumbling before being halted.
[ID:nLDE75N0SC]
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro fell 0.5
percent on the day to $1.41860 . The euro was down 0.7
percent for the week and off 1.4 percent this month.
 The euro was near technical support around $1.41904, its
100-day moving average. A close below that was seen as paving
the way to more losses.
 The euro was last at 1.1876 Swiss francs , down
0.7 percent, after hitting a record low of 1.1844 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 The single euro zone currency was also weaker versus the
yen, trading down 0.7 percent at 114.04 yen .

 European leaders agreement on Greek support[ID:nLDE75M1V0]
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 The Eurogroup -- the finance ministers of the euro zone --
meets on July 3 to decide on a Greek bailout package, which has
been made conditional on Athens approving the austerity plan.
 It seems ""Europe is committed to providing Greece with the
resources it needs to survive the current crisis,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New
York.
""However, the question is not whether Greece gets enough
money to survive the crisis, but whether it gets enough money
to keep it from pulling out of the euro zone and going its own
way. Either way, a technical default seems unavoidable.""
 Greece accepted a package of 110 billion euros of European
Union and International Monetary Fund loans in May 2010 but now
needs a second bailout of a similar size to meet its financial
obligations until the end of 2014.
 An opinion poll on Friday put Greece's conservative
opposition -- which has refused to support the plan -- 2.1
points ahead of Prime Minister George Papandreou's PASOK party.
It also showed three quarters of Greeks were opposed to the
raft of tax hikes and spending cuts that would hit them hard.
[ID:nLDE75N0CC].
 Recent signs of dollar funding strains may cap any euro
rally against the dollar, with investors watching to see
whether European banks' dollar funding demand will increase in
currency forwards and cross-currency basis swaps.
 Dollar funding costs implied by euro/dollar one-year cross
currency basis swaps as well as three-month euro/dollar
forwards both rose on Friday  , pointing to
an increase in dollar funding demand through such instruments.
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 80.34 yen . The dollar
index <.DXY>, which measures its value against a basket of
currencies, traded 0.1 percent higher on the day at 75.534.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell and global
stocks slipped on Friday on concerns the Greek parliament may
shoot down new austerity measures next week, eclipsing U.S. and
German economic data that was better than expected.
 The euro slid against the dollar for a third straight
session as investors fretted that austerity measures needed for
Greece to secure more bailout funds will not pass next week.

 European shares turned negative late in the session with
Italian banks leading the market lower as worries circulated
about their capital positions and that the debt crisis was

 Concerns about the simmering European debt crisis
outweighed better-than-expected data on durable goods orders in
the United States and German sentiment.
 May durable goods orders rose 1.9 percent after dropping
2.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. Economists
had expected May's orders to rise 1.5 percent.
 The Munich-based Ifo think tank said its business climate

114.5 in June from an originally reported 114.2 in May.
 ""The market is very jittery today. The economic data is
being pushed to the back burner mainly because there is so much
uncertainty as to whether the Greek government is going to pass
the austerity measures,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX

 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell and U.S. stocks
slipped on Friday on concerns the Greek parliament may shoot
down new austerity measures, eclipsing better-than-expected
U.S. and German data.
 The euro briefly pared losses against the dollar and U.S.
Treasuries prices extended early losses after a government
report on new orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods
came in stronger for May than economists had forecast. For
details see: [ID:nN1E75N09I].
 Durable goods orders increased 1.9 percent after dropping
2.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. Economists
had expected May's orders to rise 1.5 percent.
 The euro  rose as high as 1.4309 after the data,
compared with $1.4223 moments before the report. But it was
last at $1.4197, down 0.4 percent on the day.
 Concerns that Greece's parliament may not pass the
austerity measures needed for the country to secure a further
bailout weighed on the euro. [ID:nN1E75N0B4]

 German Bund futures rose slightly as jittery traders sought
safe-haven assets on reports that the euro zone's permanent

 The Bund future  gained 8 ticks on the day at

 U.S. Treasuries were little changed. The benchmark 10-year
U.S. Treasury note  was up 3/32 in price to yield

 * Euro falls sharply on doubts Greek austerity vote won't
pass
 * Initial gains from strong German IFO quickly fizzle
 * Signs of dollar funding strains may support dollar

 By Anirban Nag and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply on Friday
as investors expressed doubt that Greece could execute the
austerity measures needed for the debt-ridden country to secure
a further bailout.	
 Comments from a maverick Greek government MP, who said he
would oppose the package next week, added to nerves and helped
send the euro down half a U.S. cent, wiping out initial gains
made on the back of a stronger-than-expected German business
sentiment survey.	
 A suspension in trade of Italian banking stocks after a 3
percent slump added to worries about the impact of euro zone
debt problems on the region's banks. 
 ""It's very ugly; a complete mess,"" said a trader in London.
""There's a rumour the (Greek) austerity won't pass.""	
 Greece's ruling party had 155 out of 300 votes in parliament
in a vote of confidence last week, suggesting how thin its
majority may be. 
 By 1115 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.4 percent on the day to a
session low of $1.4190.	
 It retreated from a session high of $1.4306 hit after
Germany's Ifo think-tank said its business climate index rose to
114.5 in June, beating expectations for a drop to 113.5.
.	
 Investors cheered the surprisingly strong Ifo reading, which
painted a rosier picture of the German economy compared with a
recent run of weak data.	
 But that euphoria quickly dissipated due to uncertainty
about what will happen if Athens is unable to pass radical
economic reforms including tax hikes and spending cuts. The
Eurogroup meets on July 3 to decide on a Greek bailout package
which has been made conditional on Athens approving more aid. 
 ""The euro popped higher (on the Ifo data), but it is still
very much trapped in a range,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank. ""It is holding fire as investors do not
want to get very optimistic given all the uncertainty about
Greece.""	
 The euro closed in on an all-time low versus the Swiss
franc and slumped roughly 1 percent against the yen
as the single currency was hammered across the board.	
 ""It's been really difficult this morning,"" said another
trader in London. ""It's all over the place, nervy and thin as
you like.""	
 
 DOLLAR FUNDING STRAINS 
 The euro fell to technical support around $1.4190, its
100-day moving average. Bids were seen around this level, but a
close below was seen as paving the way to more losses.	
 The euro is within sight of $1.4125, a low hit on Thursday
before the single currency rallied after European Union leaders
promised more money to help Greece stave off looming bankruptcy
if enacts its debt-cutting plan. 
 
 Recent signs of dollar funding strains may cap the euro's
gains against the dollar, with investors watching to see whether
European banks' dollar funding demand will increase in currency
forwards and cross-currency basis swaps.	
 Dollar funding costs implied by euro/dollar one-year cross
currency basis swaps as well as three-month euro/dollar forwards
both rose on Thursday , pointing to an
increase in dollar funding demand through such instruments.	
 ""I do see some stress and it is probably related to concerns
that the Greek crisis could turn out to be a banking crisis,""
said Rabobank's Foley. ""It is still not the central scenario,
but if it does, then the dollar is likely to be supported."" 
 The dollar index , which measures its value against a
currency basket, recovered early losses to trade flat on the day
at 75.381, is flirting with a break of trendline resistance
around 75.64, a level drawn off a peak reached in June 2010.	
 The dollar was lower against the yen, easing to 80.17 yen
with traders citing talk of a large expiry at 80.50 yen
and importer bids at 80.00/10 yen levels.

 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters)- Greece's deal with international
lenders for more money in return for more budget austerity
lifted world equities on Friday and drained demand for
safe-haven government bonds.	
 Wall Street looked set for moderate gains.	
 Benchmark Brent oil prices slipped after tumbling to a
four-month low in the previous session on news of an
International Energy Agency-coordinated release of emergency
stockpiles.	
 The euro was volatile, strengthening after Germany's Ifo
unexpectedly showed business confidence rising, but then as
jitters build up about whether Greece would actually be able for
adopt its new austerity programme.	
 Late on Thursday, European Union leaders promised more money
to help Greece stave off looming bankruptcy, on condition that
the parliament in Athens next Tuesday enacts an austerity plan
finalised in fraught last-minute talks with international
lenders.	
 Though still fragile, the agreement was enough to lure
investors back into some riskier assets which they had dumped in
the run up to the pact.	
 ""The agreement has been received well by the (stock)
markets,"" said Ian Richards, European equity strategist at RBS.	
 ""We have got to get through the votes on June 28. It looks
like it will go through, but it's not a formality. So the market
is going to be cognisant of that near-term risk.""	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.6
percent, hauling themselves just back into positive territory
for the year-to-date.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index
gained 0.4 percent but was off highs after losing more than 1
percent in the previous session.	
 Earlier Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark gained 0.9
percent to close at a three-week high.	
 
 EURO RISES	
 Foreign exchange traders were less positive about the Greek
deal, focusing on the struggles ahead for the euro.	
 ""The euro is struggling a bit and this deal isn't really a
game changer,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at
CIBC World Markets. ""It just brings into focus the hurdles the
Greeks have to cross with these austerity measures."" 
 The currency was lower against the dollar at $1.4220 .	
 News that shares in some Italian banks had been suspended
from trading and continued nervousness over Greece's ability to
execute austerity measures kept the currency on the back
foot. 
 Yields on core euro zone government bonds rose in line with
the gains on stock markets.	
 Investors, however, remained highly cautious about the state
of peripheral debt, with the cost of insuring Greek and
Portuguese debt rising.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, June 24 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks led Asian
equity markets higher on Friday on hopes inflation will ease
soon, though the euro's overnight rally fizzled, with Greece's
deal with international lenders seen as only a short-term fix
for a long-term crisis.	
 Asian stocks were broadly heading to their first weekly
gains in nine weeks, and European shares were set to rise
between 1 to 1.3 percent, according to financial bookmakers.
 
 A jump in Chinese banking stocks on solid volume after
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was quoted in a report saying
inflation is being tamed made some analysts suspect that
emerging Asian equities, which have been haunted by fears of
lingering price pressures, might post a sustained rally.

 ""The market has been waiting for this for a long time,"" said
Todd Martin, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale in
Hong Kong. ""There's a sense that inflationary pressures might
recede or decelerate."" 
 The U.S. dollar was on course for its third straight week
of strengthening against a basket of currencies as broader
sentiment remained fragile after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut
its forecasts for growth this year and data showed Chinese
factory growth virtually stalled in June.	
 Crude oil rebounded from a four-month low below $106,
rising nearly a dollar to above $108 per barrel.	
 The move from the International Energy Agency late Thursday
to release emergency oil reserves for the third time in history
has had a muted impact on energy counters with oil prices
already more than 20 percent off their early May peaks.

 Greece meanwhile reached an agreement with EU and IMF
leaders on additional tax hikes and spending cuts to plug a 3.8
billion euro funding gap, paving the way for the disbursal of
much-needed emergency funds in July. 
 
 CHINA STOCKS RALLY	
 The Shanghai composite index jumped 2.5 percent , on
track for the biggest daily gain since February, bouncing back
after plumbing a nine-month low on Monday. 
 Banks, which have been a big target of short sellers in Hong
Kong, were the biggest supports for the benchmark index, with
Bank of China Ltd up 2.5 percent and Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China Ltd up 1.8 percent. 
 Japan's Nikkei and Korea's were up by 0.9
percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
rose by 1.1 percent, with buying spread fairly
evenly through the sectors. 
 In credit markets, high yield bond outflows intensified in
the week to June 22 with investors pulling a record net $3.43
billion out of high yield bond funds, rotating cash into the
relative safety of higher quality fixed income investments,
Thomson Reuters Lipper data showed on Thursday. 
 Emerging market equity funds registered outflows, notching
up their worst performance since the first week of March.	
 HSBC strategists are advising investors to adopt a more
cautious approach on emerging market assets as they could suffer
from capital outflows in the case of an external shock. 
 In currency markets, the euro was largely unchanged
at $1.4258 on Thursday, though the underlying trend remained
bearish. The single currency is down more than five percent from
a two-year peak around $1.4940 hit in early May.	
 ""Part of the reason the euro's bounce was so fast (on
Thursday) was probably because there was some position unwinding
ahead of the weekend,"" says Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for
Okasan Securities' foreign securities department.	
 Spot gold steadied around $1,520 per ounce after
falling two percent in the previous session while silver
held above the $35 an ounce line.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, June 24 (Reuters) - The euro held steady against
the dollar on Friday as a short-covering bounce stalled on
lingering uncertainty about the fate of Greece's austerity plan,
with signs of money market strains also seen as a potential
downside risk for the single currency.	
 The euro bounced off the previous day's low following news
that Greece had reached a deal with international lenders on an
austerity plan that would bring it one step closer to securing
much-needed financial aid. 
 But the euro later lost steam, with the single currency last
standing at $1.4255 , little changed from late U.S.
trading on Thursday, its earlier bounce having stalled just
below resistance near $1.4286.	
 That coincides with the conversion line on the daily
Ichimoku chart, a popular technical analysis tool, and the euro
faces more resistance at the base line, which now lies near
$1.4332.	
 ""Part of the reason the euro's bounce was so fast (on
Thursday) was probably because there was some position unwinding
ahead of the weekend,"" says Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for
Okasan Securities' foreign securities department in Tokyo.	
 ""I think you would have to put a question mark on whether it
can keep extending its bounce,"" Soma said.	
 Indeed, the Greek government's austerity plan, including
deep spending cuts and more tax hikes, must still be passed by
the Greek parliament at a vote next week.	
 ""The potential for further uncertainty suggests that the
euro could pull back as quickly as it has rallied on the first
sign of trouble,"" said David Rodriguez, strategist at DailyFX.	
 Market players cited talk of euro offers around
$1.4290/4310, which looked set to cap the currency for now. 
 ""I find it really hard to buy the euro at this stage,"" said
a trader at a Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 ""The market is of course worried about Greece, but because
yields between bonds of other peripheral euro zone countries and
German Bunds widened on Thursday, people were reminded about the
serious risk of contagion,"" the trader added.	
 The yield spreads on 10-year Spanish government bonds over
10-year German government bonds widened on Thursday, as did the
yield spread on 10-year Italian government bonds against
comparable German bonds. 
 The euro held steady against the Swiss franc at 1.1954
, staying above a record low of 1.18470 struck on
Thursday on trading platform EBS. 
 
 
 
 Recent signs of dollar funding strains may also weigh on the
euro against the dollar, with investors watching to see whether
European banks' dollar funding demand will increase in currency
forwards and cross-currency basis swaps.	
 Dollar funding costs implied by euro/dollar one-year cross
currency basis swaps as well as three-month euro/dollar forwards
had both risen on Thursday , pointing to an
increase in dollar funding demand through such instruments.	
 ""If banks can borrow in interbank (money) markets even if
they have to pay a premium, then that would be ok. If not, they
may have to just buy dollars, although that would be something
of a last resort,"" said Okasan Securities' Soma.	
 Such signs of increased dollar funding demand could lend
support to the greenback in the currency market, right at a time
when the dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, is flirting with a break of trendline
resistance drawn off a peak reached in June 2010.	
 The dollar index last stood at 75.291 ,
hovering close to the trendline resistance that lay right around
75.64.	
 A rise above that resistance and the mid-June high of 76.015
could set the dollar index up for further gains, with the next
major peak on charts coming in at 76.366. Above that, the
200-day moving average lies at 77.218.	
 Sterling, which slumped to a three-month lows around $1.5938
on Thursday, held steady on the day at $1.6015.	
 The pound came under selling pressure this week after
minutes of the Bank of England's June meeting flagged prospects
of another round of stimulus through quantitative easing (QE),
or asset purchases.	
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 80.50 yen .
A trader at a Japanese brokerage said strong bids were
supporting the dollar at levels below 80.50 yen, while dollar
offers were seen roughly around 80.80 yen to 81.00 yen.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro rose
from last week's three-week lows on Tuesday as expectations that
the euro zone will avoid a messy default of Greek sovereign debt
attracted investors back into risky assets.
 Investors are awaiting a parliamentary confidence vote for
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, a step towards the
passage of more spending cuts in exchange for foreign loans.
 World stocks are down nearly 8 percent from their three-year
high set in May as investors grew worried disorderly
restructuring of Greek debt would cause ructions in the market
and hit the region's banking sector. 
 ""The market is likely to lack true conviction. The Greek
situation continues to cast a very long shadow over the market.
All eyes are going to be on the political vote in Greece to see
where that leads us,"" said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at
Hargreaves Lansdown.
 ""Certainly valuations are more attractive than they were. We
have seen some selective bargain hunting here and there.""
MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up half a
percent on the day while the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
rose 0.5 percent. 
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 1 percent. Shanghai stocks
<.SSEC> -- which have been under pressure on concerns about more
credit tightening -- rose 1 percent to move away from the
previous day's 9-month low. U.S. stock futures  also
pointed to a firmer open on Wall Street later.
 ""From a valuation perspective, the equity market is very
attractive. In a more normal environment, we would clearly be at
a 'buy' level,"" said Marco Bruzzo, fund manager at Mirabaud
Gestion Asset Management.
 ""But in the short term, the market is reined in by the
sovereign debt crisis, the U.S. economic slowdown and China's
inflation risks.""
 Bund futures  were steady on the day while the euro
rose 0.3 percent to $1.4355 . The single currency has
fallen 3.7 percent from its 2-1/2 year peak against the dollar
set in May.
 If the confidence vote is passed, the Greek parliament will
vote on the austerity measures by June 28. Euro zone finance
ministers gave debt-crippled Greece two weeks from Monday to
approve further spending cuts and tax rises in return for
another 12 billion euros in emergency loans. [ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 Credit rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday it would regard
both a Greek sovereign debt swap and a rollover of maturities,
even a voluntary one, as a default. [ID:nL3E7HL050]
 U.S. crude oil  rose 1 percent to $94.24 a barrel,
helped by the dollar which fell a quarter percent against a
basket of major currencies <.DXY>.
 The Federal Reserve starts its two-day meeting later on
Tuesday. Since its last meeting in April, U.S. economic data has
taken a decisively weak tone but the central bank has set the
bar very high for any more monetary stimulus after its $600
billion bond buying programme that ends this month.
 ""The consensus remains that this is a temporary slowdown.
(But) it might turn out some form of additional non-conventional
programme may be needed,"" said Yves Bonzon, chief investment
officer at Pictet Wealth Management.

 SINGAPORE, June 21 (Reuters) - The euro inched up in choppy
trading on Tuesday on hopes that squabbling policymakers will
come up with a solution to avoid a debt default by Greece,
sentiment that also buoyed Asian shares.	
 Markets are waiting for a confidence vote on the government
in the Greek parliament later in the day, a step towards the
passage of more spending cuts in exchange for foreign emergency
loans.	
 Meanwhile, international lenders are making an unexpected
visit to Athens to check on its resolve to implement painful
austerity plans that have caused weeks of public protests and
political confusion. 
 The euro last traded at $1.4347 , well above the
three-week low of $1.4073 it hit last Thursday, but down from
the day's high of $1.4385.	
 ""In the big scheme of things, market players are starting to
believe that euro zone policy makers, especially German policy
makers, will try to avoid a hard landing in Greece,"" said Makoto
Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. 
 If the confidence vote is passed, the Greek parliament will
vote on the austerity measures by June 28. Euro zone finance
ministers gave debt-crippled Greece two weeks from Monday to
approve further spending cuts and tax rises in return for
another 12 billion euros in emergency loans. 
 Were Greece to default on its sovereign debt, markets fear
it could trigger a global financial crisis in much the same way
that Lehman Brothers' collapse did in 2008. This time, however,
debt-laden governments and central banks may have far less room
to offer any fresh stimulus to shore up economic growth. 
 
 Credit rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday it would regard
both a Greece sovereign debt swap and a rollover of maturities,
even a voluntary one, as a default. 
 As the euro recovered, the dollar index lapsed to
74.837 from a top of 75.472.	
 Investors are also eyeing a meeting of the U.S. Federal
Reserve on Tuesday and Wednesday, at which it will give its
views on U.S. economic growth. Since its last meeting in April,
the economy has taken a decidely weaker tone, but there is no
evidence yet that it may be sliding back into recession.	
 Japan's Nikkei average ended 1.1 percent higher,
while MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks
excluding Japan advanced 1.2 percent. Indexes in Hong Kong,
South Korea and Taiwan also rose.	
 The outlook for the Nikkei was largely rangebound trading
for the rest of June, an analyst said. 
 ""At least until the central bank's tankan is out (on July
1), rises are likely to be limited to around 9,500,"" said
Kenichi Hirano, a strategist at Tachibana Securities, referring
to the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of corporate sentiment. 
 ""The market has priced in bad sentiment for the April-June
quarter, but if the outlook for July-September is bright, the
market may rise further.""	
 Brent crude oil for delivery in August  was steady at
$111.90 a barrel. ICE Brent futures lost 1 percent on
Monday as worries about a resolution to the Greek debt crisis
made investors more risk averse, traders said.	
 Gold inched up to $1,542.34 per ounce by 0524 GMT,
after closing at $1,540.95 on Monday. Gold, one of the chief
beneficiaries of worries about the security of currencies and
other assets, set a record high of $1,575.79 per ounce in early
May.

 NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices slid and the euro
wavered on Monday as investors sought to avoid risk after
European finance ministers postponed doling out emergency loans
to Greece until the debt-strapped country approves new
austerity measures.
 Euro zone ministers meeting in Luxembourg gave Greece two
weeks to approve stricter austerity measures in return for
another 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in aid, piling pressure
on Athens to get its ragged finances in order. For more, see:
[ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 Many asset classes hovered near break-even as investors
grappled with whether Greece's fiscal crisis posed systemic
risks and with the outlook for a flagging U.S economy.
 The euro slid against the Swiss franc but recouped losses
against the U.S. dollar and yen, while the dollar rose slightly
against a basket of major currencies. The U.S. Dollar Index
<.DXY> rose 0.07 percent and the euro  rose 0.2 percent.
 ""The strength of the franc shows investors are very nervous
right now and are skeptical about Greece getting aid,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New
York. ""If they were truly optimistic, we would not see the
franc continue to remain strong.""
 U.S. equities moved higher, pulling global stock indexes up
to break-even levels, and bond prices fell, erasing early gains
as fears about U.S. stocks, where revenue is not driven by
Europe, ebbed over contagion from Greece's debt crisis.
 The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX>, which tracks investor
sentiment, slid 6.7 percent. In Europe, the Euro STOXX 50
volatility index <.V2TX>, one of Europe's main gauges of
investor anxiety closed 5.3 percent higher.
 ""Even though the EU is talking tough it looks like things
are going to come through in terms of providing additional
funding, at least through the end of this year, and probably
something will come together on the broader package as well,""
said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook
Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  fell 4/32
in price to yield 2.96 percent. Yields earlier slipped to 2.89
percent.
 The 10-year note has strong technical resistance at 2.88
percent, the lowest yield since the beginning of December and a
level tested last week.
 A further drop in U.S. bond yields may depend on whether
investors fear a higher risk of contagion from the troubled
euro zone, or see much weaker economic data.
 ""The market is having difficulty rallying without bad news
from Europe or bad news on the side of the U.S. economy,"" said
Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading at Bank of Nova
Scotia in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 66.22
points, or 0.55 percent, at 12,070.58. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 5.83 points, or 0.46 percent, at
1,277.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 12.08
points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,628.56.
 European shares fell on growing unease about the euro zone
debt crisis and a possible downgrade of Italy's credit rating.
[ID:nLDE75J1P7]
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed 0.5 percent lower at 1,081.19 points, its lowest
closing level in three months.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> straddled break-even, down 0.1 percent.
 Oil prices in London, which now reflect global sentiment on
crude, fell while U.S crude prices rose.
 Brent crude  settled down $1.52, or 1.3 percent, at
$111.69 a barrel.
 U.S. light crude  settled up 25 cents, or 0.27
percent, at $93.26.
 Commodity markets remained fixed on the European debt
crisis.
 ""An expected short-term agreement will likely enable
markets to breathe a little easier and allow commodity
complexes to stage a respectable bounce on account of a
stronger euro,"" MF Global analysts said in a note.
 ""However, any 'solution' for Greece will be a temporary fix
at best, as this issue is far too difficult to be wrapped up in
a few weeks.""
 Spot gold prices  rose $2.25 to $1,540.65 an ounce.

 NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - The euro slid against the
Swiss franc on Monday and could fall further after European
finance ministers failed to provide clarity on Greece's outlook
by delaying a decision on the next tranche of financial aid.
 Euro zone finance ministers gave Greece two weeks from
Monday to approve further spending cuts and tax rises in
exchange for another 12 billion euros in emergency loans,
piling pressure on Athens to get its ragged finances in order.
[ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 After two days of crisis talks, the ministers effectively
issued Athens an ultimatum.
The euro's performance against the safe-haven Swiss franc
has of late reflected investors' true sentiment on the euro
zone's single currency.
 The euro hit a session low of 1.2015 francs ,
according to Reuters data, before paring losses and was last
down 0.4 percent at 1.2096 francs.
 ""The strength of the franc shows investors are very nervous
right now and are skeptical about Greece getting aid,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New
York. ""If they were truly optimistic we would not see the franc
continue to remain strong.""
 The euro was little changed against the dollar, recovering
from losses that took it as low as $1.41910, well above a
three-week low of $1.40730 hit on Thursday on trading platform
EBS.
 It was last at $1.43080 .

 A comment by Klaus Regling, chief of the European
FinancialStability Facility, that the fund's guarantees will be
raised to 780 billion euros from 440 billion, did lift the euro
a bit, especially against the dollar and yen. For Regling, see
[ID:nBRU011579].
 The euro earlier hit session highs at $1.43280 in the wake
of comments from EFSF's Regling.
 There was also a sense of optimism in the market that the
Greek parliament will likely pass the austerity plan and
Greece's prime minister George Papandreou will win a
parliamentary vote of confidence in the new cabinet on
Tuesday.
 Markets will now watch the result of a vote of confidence
the newly reshuffled Greek cabinet faces on Tuesday.
[ID:nLDE66D1JB]
 ""I don't think these pieces of positive news will change
negative sentiment on the euro,"" said David Gilmore, a partner
at currency research firm FX Analytics in Esse, Connecticut.
 ""Even if we assume the most optimistic view, we're just a
few months away from September when the International Monetary
Fund and the European Union have to go back to Greece and do
another assessment for the next tranche.""
 Gilmore said he doesn't think there's any way Greece will
perform to the ""level of satisfaction that the IMF and EU are
looking for and so we could be back to square one.""
 Traders said a move by the euro below $1.40730 would target
the 200-week moving average around $1.40150.
 GFT Forex's Lien said it will be difficult for the
euro/dollar to make sustainable gains until there is more
clarity about Greece's aid.
 ""I do not see a deal getting done until July,"" she said.
""If an investor had to pick one week to reduce exposure to the
euro this would be the week.""
 Risk reversals on euro/dollar options, which show strong
demand for bets on the euro falling compared with bets on it
rising, demonstrated the negative view investors have on the
shared currency.
 One-month risk reversals were trading around 2.7 percent
 in favor of euro puts, hovering near their
highest level since the euro zone's debt problems reached
crisis point in May-June 2010, according to data from
interdealer broker ICAP.
 One factor that may lend support to the euro in the near
term, however, is a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting later
this week, traders said.
 The Fed is expected to restate its commitment to hold
interest rates near zero for an extended period amid fresh
signs the U.S. recovery has lost momentum. It is likely to
continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds it holds to
make sure its balance sheet does not shrink. [ID:nN14191675]

 LONDON/NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Global stocks dipped
and crude oil fell on Monday after euro zone finance ministers
delayed a decision on extending emergency loans to Greece,
though the euro trimmed losses against the dollar on comments
the size of a European bailout fund would grow.
 Yields on safer U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds slipped
and gold prices held steady above $1,530 an ounce as investors
sold assets perceived as risky and sought safety in government
bonds.
 Euro zone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg said
Greece had to show progress on plans to cut spending, raise
taxes and generate new revenue streams before a final decision
is made on a further 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in loans.

sealed and dusted,"" said Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar.
""Markets are just starting the week slightly risk averse,

 By Anirban Nag and Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday, trading
close to recent lows as a delay to the next tranche of Greek
bailout funds undermined confidence in the single currency, with
the options market and technical charts pointing to more losses.
 Euro zone finance ministers said they expected 12 billion
euros in emergency loans to Greece to be paid by mid-July, but
the disbursement would depend on the Greek parliament first
approving new austerity measures. [ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 Traders and analysts said uncertainty over the Greek crisis
left investors inclined to sell the euro on any rallies.
 ""There is still very little confidence out there and too
much political risk and it is quite likely the market is looking
for the downside in euro/dollar,"" said Lena Komileva, global
head of G10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 However, she said for now markets believed euro zone
countries would reach an agreement that would keep the Greek
crisis temporarily contained and she expected this would hold
the euro in a range between $1.40 and $1.45.
 The euro  was down 0.7 percent against the dollar at
$1.4214, in sight of a three-week low of $1.4073 hit on Thursday
on trading platform EBS. A move below there would target the
200-week moving average around $1.4015.
 The euro's losses picked up steam earlier in the session
after stop-loss offers were triggered near $1.4250. However, it
came off a session low of $1.4191 on a bout of short covering. 
 Traders said large options expiries at $1.4200 reportedly
due on Monday could keep the euro hovering around that level. 
 ""At the moment we are still in limbo - the European Union
and European Central Bank appear to have reached a compromise on
private sector involvement in the Greek bailout, but are still
demanding austerity measures which are unacceptable to some in
Greece,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe
Generale.
 ""(The euro's) failure to hold above $1.43 last week
threatens a fresh downside test.""
 Below the psychological $1.4000 level, the next target would
be the May 23 low of $1.3968.
 Market players said they expected European authorities to
ultimately extend the emergency loans that Greece needs by
mid-July to avoid defaulting on its debt. 
 Still, the current impasse and bickering between
policymakers has driven up the cost of insuring Greek debt
against default and increased the risk of investors losing
confidence in other vulnerable euro zone debtors.
 Italian credit default swaps spiked higher after Moody's
placed the country on a review for downgrade late on Friday,
citing concerns over increased borrowing costs stemming from the
Greek crisis and structural impediments to growth.[GVD/EUR]
 Markets will now watch the result of a vote of confidence
the newly reshuffled Greek cabinet faces on
Tuesday.[ID:nLDE66D1JB]
 
 MORE DOWNSIDE RISKS 
 Risk reversals on euro/dollar options, which show strong
demand for bets on the euro falling compared to bets on it
rising, demonstrated the negative view investors have on the
shared currency.
 One-month risk reversals were trading around 2.7 percent
 in favour of euro puts, hovering near their
highest level since the euro zone's debt problems reached crisis
point in May-June 2010, according to data from interdealer
broker ICAP.
 One factor that may lend support to the euro in the near
term, however, is a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting later
this week, traders said.
 The Fed is expected to restate its commitment to hold
interest rates near zero for an extended period amid fresh signs
the U.S. recovery has lost momentum. It is likely to continue to
reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds it holds to make sure its
balance sheet does not shrink. [ID:nN14191675]
 ""The focus is on how concerned the Fed is over recent soft
U.S. data and whether it is considered just a temporary blip,""
said Tom Levinson, currency strategist at ING.
 On Monday, investors preferred to buy the dollar as euro
zone debt worries and concerns about a global slowdown
encouraged flight to safe-haven assets, with the Swiss franc
 and the yen  also benefiting.
 High-yielding currencies fell sharply, with the Australian
dollar  losing more than 1 percent to $1.0496. The New
Zealand dollar  was also down 0.9 percent at $0.8052.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.5
percent at 75.39. The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen
at 80.22 yen  with traders citing talk of exporter selling
interest above 80.50 yen.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - World stocks, the euro and crude
prices fell on Monday and bond yields in heavily indebted euro
zone countries jumped after the region's finance ministers
delayed a final decision on extending emergency loans to Greece.
 Yields on safer U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds slipped and
gold prices held steady at above $1,530 an ounce.
 Euro zone finance ministers have postponed a final decision
on extending a further 12 billion euros in emergency loans to
Greece, ratcheting up pressure on Athens to first impose harsh
austerity measures. [ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 They said they expected the money, the next tranche in last
year's 110 billion euro bailout package extended by the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund, to be paid by
mid-July.
 ""At the moment then, we are still in limbo. The EU and ECB
appear to have reached a compromise on private sector
involvement in the Greek bailout, but are still demanding
austerity measures which are unacceptable to some in Greece,""
said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 The euro  was down 0.6 percent at $1.4222, edging back
in the direction of a three-week low of $1.4073 hit last Thursday
on trading platform EBS, and down 0.8 percent to 1.2041 Swiss
francs .
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies <.DXY>.
 The yield on 10-year Greek government bonds 
jumped 30 basis points (bps) to 17.827 percent, not far from a
euro lifetime high of 18.90 percent hit on Friday.
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default rose, with
the five-year credit default swaps (CDS) up 103 bps to 2,000 bps
after earlier matching a record high of 2,025 bps hit last week.
 Yields on 10-year Italian government bonds 
were up 3.4 bps to 4.858 percent and the five-year Italian CDS
rose 11 bps to 182 bps after Moody's warned late on Friday that
it could cut its rating on Italy's sovereign debt, adding to
contagion fears in the euro zone. [ID:nN17266057]
 ""That's the worry: How far is this going to spread?,"" said
Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> lost 0.9 percent, while
the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Index <.TRXFLDPIPU> shed
2.4 percent and Italy's benchmark stock index <.FTMIB> dropped
2.5 percent.
 U.S. stock index futures    fell 0.5 to
0.6 percent, indicating a soft open for Wall Street.
 
 WORLD STOCKS, OIL DOWN
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.6 percent after a three-week decline. The
benchmark is down 1.1 percent this year.
 Brent crude  fell for the fourth straight session,
down 1.4 percent to below $112 a barrel, while copper prices
 lost 1.2 percent, falling below $9,000 an ounce.
 UBS strategists said in a note that investors should remain
""underweight"" global equities and cyclical commodities, even
though risk asset valuations were ""undemanding"", until euro zone
debt uncertainty subsided and U.S. growth improved.
 The deepening political crisis in Greece has done nothing to
change UBS's view that a default was likely, they said.
 ""Whether this leads to imminent default, remains unclear ...
We, the markets and more recently the ratings agencies, believe
default is unavoidable. What is less clear, however, is how the
crisis might spread via financial linkages to other parts of the
capital markets,"" they said.
 ""Precisely that uncertainty is reason, we believe, to remain
cautious, as reflected in our underweight allocation to global
equities.""

 By Eric Burroughs and Masayuki Kitano	
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, June 20 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on
Monday as euro zone finance ministers postponed a decision on
extending the next tranche of Greek bailout funds, with recent
demand for euro put options suggesting investors were bracing
for further weakness. 
 Euro zone finance ministers said they expected 12 billion
euros in emergency loans to Greece to be paid by mid-July, but
added that disbursement would depend on the Greek parliament
first passing laws on fiscal reforms. 
 ""People want decisive action. And delaying it, even for good
reasons, doesn't deliver that,"" said Adarsh Sinha, head of
Asia-Pacific G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in
Hong Kong.	
 ""The bottom line for the market is that it prolongs the
uncertainty.""	
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.4232 , edging back in
the direction of a three-week low of $1.4073 hit last Thursday
on trading platform EBS.	
 The euro's drop picked up steam after stop-loss offers were
triggered at levels near $1.4250.	
 Market players said they expected European authorities to
ultimately extend the emergency loans to Greece, which has said
it needs by mid-July to avoid defaulting on its debt. 
 ""They will probably disburse the funds, because you would
think that there is no way that they will allow a default (by
Greece),"" said Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign exchange
research for Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo. 
 ""But the situation still remains opaque,"" Fukaya said,
adding that euro zone officials may be trying to put pressure on
Greece's parliament to adopt fiscal austerity measures. 
 Markets will also closely watch the result of a vote of
confidence the newly reshuffled Greek cabinet is due to face on
Tuesday. 
 
 RISK REVERSALS	
 Risk reversals on euro/dollar options, which offer an
indication of how strong demand is for euro put options compared
to demand for euro call options, show that investors have a
negative view on the euro. 
 The risk reversal skew shows that traders are taking
euro-bearish positions in options instead of the choppy spot
market and that others are using options to hedge their long
euro positions, said Sinha at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.	
 One-month risk reversals now favour euro puts by 2.95
, the highest level since the euro zone debt
crisis reached a fever pitch in May-June 2010, according to data
from interdealer broker ICAP. 
 One factor that may lend support to the euro in the
near-term, however, is the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting
later this week, market players said.	
 The U.S. central bank is expected to restate its commitment
to hold interest rates near zero for an extended period amid
signs the recovery has lost momentum and continue to reinvest
proceeds from maturing bonds it holds to make sure its
balance-sheet does not shrink. 
 ""I think what the market is probably expecting is for the
Fed to end QE2...but to keep its balance sheet bloated,"" said a
trader for a Japanese brokerage house in Tokyo, referring to the
Fed's Treasuries-buying programme. 
 If the Fed goes a step further and suggests that it may
embark on a third round of quantitative easing if needed, that
could trigger dollar-selling and help prop up the euro, the
trader said.	
 The euro's drop on Monday saw the dollar index , which
tracks the greenback's performance against a basket of major
currencies, rise 0.4 percent to 75.317. 
 Technical charts suggest that the dollar index is still
caught in a downtrend. The dollar index's rise last week had
stalled right near trendline resistance drawn from its June 2010
peak.	
 The dollar also edged higher against the yen, rising 0.2
percent to 80.19 yen . The trader for a Japanese brokerage
house said there was talk of stop-loss offers near 79.50 yen,
adding that a breach of that level could open the way for the
dollar to drop below 79.00 yen.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, June 20 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Monday and
Asian stocks flipped back into the red after euro zone finance
ministers delayed a final decision on extending emergency loans
to debt-stricken Greece, dashing hopes for a quick solution to
the political impasse.	
 Taking a cue from weak Asian markets, financial bookmakers
expect to see the leading European benchmark indexes falling,
resuming their seven-week slide as fears of a Greek default
prompt investors to dump riskier assets. 
 Euro zone finance ministers at the weekend postponed a final
decision on extending a further $17 billion in emergency loans
to Greece, ratcheting up pressure on Athens to first impose
harsh austerity measures. 
 But they added that they still expected the money, the next
tranche in a bailout package extended by the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund, to be paid by mid-July.	
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a radio
station that a vote of confidence in Greece's new government on
Tuesday could pave the way for a payout of the next tranche.

 Even if a second bailout plan is cobbled together in time,
it may only buy Athens a few more months' breathing room before
it again has to face the prospect of default or a radical
restructuring of it debt that would shock Europe's financial
system. 
 The euro dipped 0.3 percent to $1.4263, edging back in the
direction of a three-week low of $1.4073 hit last Thursday on
trading platform EBS and taking the wind out of early gains in
Asian stock markets.	
 Japan's Nikkei ended little changed on the day after
having risen as much as 0.7 percent earlier.	
 The MSCI index of shares outside Japan
sank back into negative territory after being up
as much as 0.6 percent earlier. It has fallen for eight
consecutive weeks.	
 Losses in equities sapped demand for high-yielding
currencies like the Australian dollar and the New Zealand
dollar. Other risky assets also came under selling
pressure.	
 Oil prices  fell more than $1, extending last week's
losses, on worries that Europe's debt crisis and a faltering
U.S. economy would curb energy demand. Brent crude  slid
to just under $112 a barrel.	
 The iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment grade bond index
was around 116 basis points, nearly 10 bps wider on
the month.	
 ""There's still plenty of uncertainty before investors get
more sense how much further the three issues will deteriorate,""
said Dennes Chang, chief investment officer of Jih Sun
Securities Investment Trust referring to concern over slowdowns
in the United States and China and the euro zone debt problems.	
 In another sign of risk aversion, high-yield bond funds saw
big outflows while India-focused equity funds suffered their
seventh straight week of outflows, according to data from
fund-tracker EPFR Global.	
 Elsewhere, the dollar weakened against the yen, falling
towards the lower-end of the prevailing range roughly between
79.50-82.00 yen before a meeting by the Federal Reserve's
policy-setting arm on June 21-22 which is unlikely to offer any
support to the greenback. 
 Demand for perceived safe-haven assets remained strong.	
 Yields on ten-year U.S. Treasury notes held
around 2.94 percent, well below a June peak of 3.10 percent
while the Swiss franc held near a record high against the
beleaguered euro.	
 Gold ticked higher after posting its biggest one-day
gain in three weeks in the previous session while silver
advanced.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro rose for the second
straight day against the U.S. dollar on Friday and could extend
gains next week on hopes that Greece will get a new aid package
needed to avoid a default that could roil global markets.
 The leaders of Germany and France said on Friday they were
united on a rescue deal for Greece that would include voluntary
private sector participation. The euro has been hampered in
recent weeks by discord between euro zone paymaster Germany and
the European Central Bank, backed by France.
 Caution is warranted, analysts said, with euro zone finance
ministers slated to meet on Sunday and Monday, which will be
followed by a summit of EU leaders later next week. The Greek
cabinet, reshuffled on Friday, will face a vote of confidence
by Tuesday night.
 ""There is a key risk in Europe linked to the Greek vote of
confidence and when it passes we may well see euro/dollar
attempt a move to the $1.4569 level,"" said Sebastien Galy,
senior currency strategist at Societe Generale in London.
 ""We have maintained a bullish forecast in euro/dollar of
$1.50 over the coming weeks. Trust in Europe to come through in
the face of a crisis, once again.""
 The euro hit a session high of $1.43397 on trading platform
EBS, before retreating to $1.4306, up 0.7 percent . It
remains down 0.2 percent on the week.
 The euro pared some of its gains after Moody's placed
Italy's credit ratings on review for a possible downgrade,
heightening fears of contagion. [ID:nWNA1370]
 ""Contagion should not happen. As a result, I think there's
going to be a package put together over the weekend, which is
going to effectively offer Greece another a lifeline,"" said
Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president at Tempus Consulting in
Washington. ""No one, however, is going to deal with the issue
and (they will) simply kick the can down the road.""
 EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn
said euro zone finance ministers will decide on Sunday to
disburse the next tranche of emergency loans to Greece in early
July and decide on the new three-year bailout on July 11.
 Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in
New York, said the market ""underappreciates"" the political risk
that still exists. ""If Greece's government loses a
no-confidence vote, the euro would gap down. People should be
cautious,"" he said.
 The euro gained 0.8 percent to 1.2136 Swiss francs
, rebounding from Thursday's record low of 1.1946.
 Currency speculators slightly trimmed bets in favor of the
euro in the latest week as they boosted bets against the U.S.
dollar to a five-week high, data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed on Friday. See [ID:nN17268026]
 FED POLICY
 Developments in Europe's weaker economies will likely
overshadow a two-day policy meeting by the Federal Reserve,
which could shed light on the U.S. central bank's stance on the
need for further steps to stimulate the flagging recovery.
 The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting
panel, is expected to make an announcement at 2:15 p.m. (1815
GMT) on Wednesday, immediately followed by a press briefing by
Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 BNP Paribas said it expects the Fed meeting to prove
negative for the U.S. dollar.
 ""With the FOMC this week likely to maintain its dovish
stance and use the 'extended period' language on both rates and
its balance sheet, U.S. dollar weakness is on the cards,"" the
firm's currency strategists wrote to clients.
 But they added that the dollar could regain traction if the
Greece situation worsens and risk sentiment deteriorates.
 The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 80.08 yen, and was on track
for a 0.3 percent drop for the week .
 U.S. consumer sentiment worsened this month on renewed
concerns about the outlook for the economy and as gloom about
job and income prospects persisted, data showed on Friday.
 Next week's U.S. economic calendar includes existing and
new home sales, durable goods orders, and a final reading of

 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Stocks and the euro rose on
Friday after the leaders of France and Germany hinted at an aid
deal to save Greece from default and avert another global
crisis, but investors will remain on edge until an accord is
reached.
 Speculation that the heavily indebted euro-zone nation
could receive 120 billion euros before it runs out of cash this
summer offered a measure of comfort to investors who were
rocked by exceptional market volatility this week.
 ""What sparked the market today was some relief from
European leaders that they'll do what they can to avoid a
credit crisis,"" said King Lip, investment officer at Baker
Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.
 However, risk aversion remains at elevated levels, signaled
by a drop in oil prices and a jump in gold and the Swiss franc,
traditionally seen as a safe-haven currency.
 Nagging doubts whether backing from French and German
leaders will speed up aid for Greece revived appetite for
low-risk government bonds, paring initial losses spurred by
encouraging remarks on Greece from German Chancellor Angela
Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 Merkel said on Friday that Germany and France wanted a
quick solution to the impasse over a new aid package for Greece
similar to the ""Vienna Initiative."" Under that 2009 pact,
lenders agreed to boost credit for central and eastern Europe,
while the main commercial banks committed to keep exposure and
roll over credit lines.
 Sarkozy said ""there was no time to lose,"" suggesting that a
deal to rescue Greece could be reached quickly. See

 The euro  was up about 0.7 percent for the day at
$1.4292, paring earlier losses in volatile trade.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 38.90 points, or 0.33 percent, at 12,000.42. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 3.56 points, or 0.28 percent, at
1,271.20. But the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 6.06
points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,617.64.
 If the S&P 500 and Dow hold on to gains, the indexes would
record their first positive week in seven. The S&P 500 is
almost 7 percent below a three-year high hit on May 2nd.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
gained 0.2 percent to end at 1,086.73. Its losing streak
extended to seven weeks, falling 4.8 percent over that span.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.4
percent, rebounding from a three-month low. It is on track to
end the week lower and has moved into negative territory for
the year.
 HIGH ANXIETY
 The outlook for stocks remains precarious, given the signs
of an economic slowdown worldwide and persistent worries over
debt issues in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland.
 The expiration of the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond
program, known as QE2, in two weeks, has left some investors
wondering how risk assets will fare without it.
 The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for
U.S. economic growth on Friday and called for Washington and
European countries to solve their budget woes. The IMF also
said some fast-growing emerging economies might be overheating.

gained against the dollar  to about $0.8473.
 The euro rebounded against the franc to 1.2114 franc
 after touching a record low on Thursday of 1.1946
on electronic trading platform EBS.
 ""While we still believe that a new Greek package will be
forthcoming, we warn of ongoing headline risk from rating
agencies, the IMF, euro-zone politicians and the ECB (European
Central Bank),"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 4/32 in
price, yielding 2.94 percent.
 September U.S. Treasury and German Bund futures fell 8/32
 and 38 basis points , respectively, after
setting contract highs on Thursday.

poised to record its biggest one-day gain in three weeks. For

 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro rose and Wall Street
stocks opened higher on Friday after words from the heads of
France and Germany hinted at an aid deal to save Greece from a
default.
 Speculation that the heavily-indebted euro zone nation
could receive 120 billion euros before it runs out of cash this
summer offered a measure of comfort to investors in a week of
exceptional volatility across all financial markets.
 Investors, less nervous, reduced their holdings of low-risk
government bonds. However, a drop in oil prices and the
firmness of gold and the Swiss franc -- traditionally seen as a
safe haven currency -- signaled risk aversion remains at
elevated levels.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that Germany
and France wanted a quick solution to the impasse over a new
aid package for Greece.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy chimed in, saying that

 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday on
hopes for a new Greek aid package and as Germany vowed to work
with the European Central Bank to resolve the crisis, although
the currency remained vulnerable absent a concrete solution.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicholas Sarkozy told a news conference after meeting on Friday
that a solution had been agreed in line with the ""Vienna
Initiative."" For more see [ID:nB4E7GN04A] and [ID:nLDE75G0UT].
 Under that 2009 pact international lenders agreed to boost
credit for central and eastern Europe and the main commercial
banks committed to maintain exposure and roll over credit
lines.
 Analysts said the comments were nothing new but European
shares turned positive and Greek bond yields and CDS fell as
risk appetite improved across those asset classes.
 Merkel and Sarkozy's endorsement of a 'Vienna'-style
rollover of Greek debt offered encouragement on an emerging
consensus on Greek aid, said Mark McCormick, currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 But McCormick also added a note of caution, saying: ""While
we still believe that a new Greek package will be forthcoming,
we warn of ongoing headline risk from rating agencies, the IMF,
euro zone politicians and the ECB.""
 The euro rose to a session high of $1.4300 before paring
gains to trade at $1.4253, still up 0.3 percent on the day
.
 It also turned positive against the Swiss franc
, last trading up 0.5 percent at 1.2103 francs, up
from Thursday's record low of 1.1946 on electronic trading
platform EBS.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent against sterling  to
88.17 pence, according to Reuters data, though it was down 0.1
percent against the yen at 114.42 yen .
 The euro has been hampered in recent weeks by discord
between euro zone paymaster Germany and the ECB, backed by
France.
 Germany has been insisting that banks, pension funds and
insurance firms that hold Greek debt swap their bonds for new
ones with longer maturities.
 But fearful this solution could create a ""credit event""
that would prompt rating agencies to label Greece in default,
the ECB, European Commission and France all favor a softer
option in which holders of Greek bonds would be asked to buy
new Greek debt as their holdings mature.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent on the week against the dollar.
 AID SPECULATION
 The euro was also boosted Friday by a bout of short
covering triggered by speculation of a new Greek aid package
that would be larger than previously thought. Traders cited
market talk of a 150-billion-euro aid package for Greece
although this could not be confirmed.
 ""When you get sharp moves on market talk it captures the
highly nervous market environment,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman,
head of currency strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank in London.
 ""Yesterday was very much doom and gloom and we are bound to
see some bounces back but until we get a firm conclusion about
the Greek situation the market will remain suspicious.""
 EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn
said euro zone finance ministers will decide at a meeting on
Sunday to disburse the next tranche of emergency loans to
Greece in early July and decide on the new three-year bailout
on July 11. [ID:nBRU011555]
 The Greek cabinet, reshuffled on Friday, will face a vote
of confidence by Tuesday night. The political moves could be
another potential flashpoint in a country already beset by
fierce anti-austerity strikes. [ID:nLDE75G0CY]
 Markets will keep a close eye on Monday's meeting and the
Greek vote for clues on how policymakers will proceed in
dealing with the debt crisis.
 The slight improvement in risk appetite boosted commodity
currencies, pushing the Australian dollar  up 0.6 percent
to $1.0615. The New Zealand dollar  also rose 0.4 percent
to $0.8086.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 80.27 yen in Friday's
trading but clung to a 0.1 percent gain for the week against
the Japanese currency .

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro turned higher on
Friday, while stocks pared losses as expectations that a
solution for debt-laden Greece maybe hammered out by euro zone
policymakers soon soothed near term concerns of a contagion.
 Peripheral bond spreads over benchmark German bunds narrowed
while Greek five-year credit default swaps fell, but overall
investor sentiment remained cautious towards riskier assets with
world stocks holding just above three-month lows and oil headed
for its biggest weekly drop since early May.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that Germany
and France wanted a quick solution to the impasse over a new aid
package for Greece. French President Nicolas Sarkozy chimed in,
saying that 'there was no time to lose', suggesting that a deal
to rescue Greece could be reached quickly. [ID:nPISHHE7SL].
 ""It seems like we have moved a couple of steps away from the
abyss ... and the fear of a disorderly default has eased for
now,"" said WestLB rate strategist, Michael Leister.
 ""But even if the worst case scenario is avoided, the
environment remains very fragile.""
 The euro  was up 0.5 percent on the day at $1.4280,
reversing earlier losses in volatile trade and moving away from
a three-week low of $1.4073 struck on Thursday.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was up 0.2 percent at 1,086.32 points, but has shed over one
percent this week.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was last up 0.2
percent, rebounding from a three-month low of 326.01 struck
earlier in the session.

 OIL SINKS 
 Besides worrying about a potential Greek debt restructuring,
and the repercussions for European banks that hold the country's
bonds, investors also fear global growth momentum is slowing
just as the Federal Reserve prepares to end its $600 billion
bond buying programme. 
 U.S. stock futures  pointed to a mixed start on Friday
with futures for the S&P 500  up 0.27 percent, Dow Jones
 futures down 0.15 percent and Nasdaq 100  futures
up 0.55 percent.
 U.S. stock investors have been consolidating their exposure
through ETFs. Inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, a popular
exchange-traded fund that tracks the benchmark U.S. stock index,
soared to a three-year high in the week ending June 15, but,
excluding ETFs, U.S. equity funds had weekly outflows of $2.03
billion during the week. [ID:nN16246219]
 The aversion to risk taking took its toll on commodities.
Brent crude for August  tumbled $2.97 per barrel to a low
of $111.05 before recovering ground to around $112.75.
 ""Everyone is fearful about the euro financial crisis,
especially in Greece,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity
derivatives manager at Japan's Newedge brokerage. ""We have seen
some good and some bad data. We hope the euro will stabilize
because it's very much correlated with crude.""
 Gold edged lower with spot gold  slipping to $1,528.49
from a high of 1,530 an ounce. The metal is heading for its
second consecutive weekly drop.

 LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
three-week low on Friday and European stocks headed for their
seventh straight weekly loss as worries about a Greek default
and the threat of contagion kept investors away from riskier
assets.
 World stocks neared three-month lows, oil headed for its
biggest weekly drop since early May and peripheral bond spreads
over benchmark German Bunds widened as political upheaval in
Greece and the inability of euro zone policymakers to define the
terms of a new rescue package soured investors' appetite.

new finance minister at the helm. [nLDE75G0CY]
 While Greek banks surged on the news, overall the move did
little to soothe investors looking for signals on whether to
shed more risky assets and take defensive positions over the
next few months.
 ""The whole austerity issue is going to be around for a long
time, but what we are trying to avoid here is contagion risk and
liquidity crunch. That's the primary concern for the markets
right now,"" said Graham Bishop, equity strategist at RBS.
 ""Near term, we have got much more defensive bias in our
portfolios.""
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet with French
President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss the details of a new Greek
aid package. German Deputy Foreign Minister Werner Hoyer said
Germany and France will likely reach a compromise on involving
private creditors.
 The euro  was firmly on the back foot, last down 0.5
percent against the dollar at $1.4140, not far from a three-week
low of $1.4073 struck on Thursday.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 0.9 percent at 1,075.35 points and has shed nearly 1.3
percent this week.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.1 percent
to trade near its lowest level since mid-March. The index has
wiped out all the gains made this year. 
 
 OIL SINKS 
 Besides worrying about a potential Greek debt restructuring,
and the repercussions for European banks that hold the country's
bonds, investors also fear global growth momentum is slowing
just as the Federal Reserve prepares to end its $600 billion
bond buying programme. 
 Weighing on stock markets, U.S. equity futures 
pointed to a weaker start on Friday, with the U.S. S&P 500 index
maybe heading for a test of its low for the year hit in March.
 U.S. stock investors have been consolidating their exposure
through ETFs. Inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, a popular

 The aversion to risk taking took its toll on commodities.
Crude oil futures fell more than $1 a barrel early in the
European session. Brent crude futures  were $1.16 lower
at $112.86 a barrel while U.S. crude futures fell $1.01 to
$93.94 a barrel.
 ""Everyone is fearful about the euro financial crisis,
especially in Greece,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity
derivatives manager at Japan's Newedge brokerage. ""We have seen
some good and some bad data. We hope the euro will stabilize
because it's very much correlated with crude.""
 Gold edged lower with spot gold  slipping to $1,524.09

weekly drop.

 SINGAPORE, Jun 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday, with
investors still largely unconvinced that Greece can dodge a debt
default without more political stability in Athens, keeping
equity and commodity prices in a near-term downtrend.	
 Greece, whose prime minister is struggling to form a
coalition government to push through unpopular austerity
reforms, has become a focal point for investors looking for
signals on whether to shed more risky assets and take defensive
positions over the next few months. 
 Olli Rehn, the European Union's top economic official, tried
to soothe markets overnight with expectations that the EU and
International Monetary Fund will disburse a 12 billion euro loan
in early July to Greece, but any benefits from his comments
quickly faded by the Asian session, where investors kept
reducing exposure to risks.	
 The euro steadily slid back toward $1.41, and shares of
Samsung Electronics , normally a favourite of foreign
investors, dropped 4 percent, while oil prices slid back to red,
heading fror their biggest weekly drop since early May.	
 After a steady feed of negative headlines on Greece,
investors were cautious ahead of a cabinet reshuffle in Athens
and a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy abot Greeek debt later on Friday.
Athens has a vote of confidence on the government scheduled for
Tuesday.	
 ""The wild card actually becomes the Greek political
situation. The Greek government has stood out from the other
troubled peripheral countries by surviving,"" Marc Chandler,
global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman,
said in a note.	
 ""A new cabinet will seek to push through the new austerity
measures as a vote of confidence. This will take place in the
coming days and before the IMF/EU have to write a check to
Greece."" 
 The Nikkei fell 0.6 percent, with weakness in
blue-chip stocks such as Honda Motor Co dragging down
the index to the lowest since March 18.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan edged
down 0.5 percent , with the tech sector by and
far the biggest drag on the index. 
 Weighing on Asian stock markets, U.S. equity futures flipped
to negative mid way through the Asian session  on Friday,
and it appeared for now that the U.S. S&P 500 index may test the
low for the year hit in March.	
 U.S. stock investors have been consolidating their exposure
through ETFs. Inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, a popular
exchange-traded fund that tracks the benchmark U.S. stock index,
soared to a three-year high in the week ending June 15, but,
excluding ETFs, U.S. equity funds had weekly outflows of $2.03
billion during the week. 
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to around $1.4135 . Traders
will look for the euro to retest Thursday's low around $1.4070
later in the day and will probably add to short positions if the
currency gets near the lows.	
 The aversion to risk taking sucked down the Australian
dollar, which fell 0.5 percent to US$1.0514 .	
 Brent oil futures fell 0.6 percent to $113.37 a barrel
, well off the six-week high reached on Wednesday of
$121.47.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks, oil and the
euro pulled back from the brink of another sell-off on
Thursday, as investors awaited signs the international
community could prevent Greece from defaulting on its debt.
 Jitters about whether the euro-zone member is edging
closer to default fueled buying of low-risk government bonds
for a second straight day.
 A strong early rebound on Wall Street ran out of steam,
with uncertainty about Greece sending stocks lower, led by
declines in shares of mining, steel and other materials
companies.
 Escalating anxiety over Greece, which could receive 125
billion euros in aid, stoked safe-haven bids for high-rated
government debt as shares touched a three-month low.
 ""People are down in the dumps right now. The damage has
been done,"" said Robert Zukowski, senior analyst at 4Cast Ltd
in New York. ""The Greek debt situation is not going away.""
 There is growing concern that a ""disorderly"" Greek default
could roil the worldwide financial system and dry up lending,
similar to what happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
in September 2008.
 ""That's a disaster scenario,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia,
although he added that the chance of a disorderly default is
remote for now.
 The anxiety over a possible Greek debt default supported
gold prices and gave investors a reason to buy low-risk
government bonds for a second straight day.
 U.S. oil prices edged up after an energy agency predicted
a sharp spike in world crude demand in third quarter.
 In an exceptionally volatile session, stocks and the euro
bobbed in and out of positive territory amid worries that
Greece's debt troubles might spiral into another global
crisis.
 Some analysts worry the debt crisis in Greece and weaker
euro-zone countries could become as bad as the 2007-2009
global credit crunch that brought down U.S. investment banks
Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
 ""The situation in Greece is starting to run away a little
bit and sort of feels like the Bear Stearns/Lehman run-up that
we saw in 2007,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director of Faros
Trading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""The euro zone is setting up
for a similar situation where the coordinated answer they need
is not coming quick enough.""
 Adding to investor worries was more evidence of a rapid
deceleration in U.S. economic activity.
 In U.S. stock trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> gained 64.25 points, or 0.54 percent, to end at
11,961.52. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 2.22
points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,267.64. But the Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> slipped 7.76 points, or 0.29 percent, to close
at 2,623.70. Earlier, the Nasdaq was down slightly more than 1
percent.
 In Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 0.42
percent to end at 1,084.47, its lowest close since mid-March.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> dropped 1
percent to 327.46, wiping out its 2011 gains. At the close,
the index was slightly more than 1 point above its session low
of 326.06, which was its lowest level since March 18th.
 In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei <.N225> fell 1.7 percent to
close at 9,411.28, following Wednesday's sharp sell-off on
Wall Street.
 LIFELINE FOR GREECE
 Investors have become more nervous about whether Athens
will receive another bout of aid, estimated at 120 billion
euros.
 European officials and the International Monetary Fund are
trying to come up with a rescue package, while the Greek
government is divided over the austerity measures needed and
how to make private investors share the burden.
 ""We still feel that they can come to the rescue in time,
and it is not out of control completely just yet, but it is
getting dangerously close,"" Bechtel said. ""All the risk
indicators are starting to show stress.""
 The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt for five years
jumped to 1,900 basis points -- the highest in the world.
 The growing financial stress from Greece's fiscal mess was
reflected in the jump in yields on Spanish government bonds to
an 11-year high and rising borrowing costs in the London
interbank market. For more on Greece's debt crisis see
[ID:nL3E7HG0P8].
 In the currency market, the euro  last traded at
$1.4212, near its session high. Earlier, the euro had touched
a three-week low against the dollar.
 The euro also declined against the Swiss franc, which
strengthens with increased global risk aversion. The euro hit
a lifetime low of 1.1957 Swiss franc  on electronic
trading platform EBS in early trading.
 Wary investors again piled into high-rated government
debt.
 September U.S. Treasury  and German Bund futures
 rose to contract highs at 124-16/32 and 126.62,
respectively.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 slipped to a six-month low at 2.92 percent, down 5
basis points on the day. The 10-year note's price, which moves
in the opposite direction, was up 15/32.
 U.S. July oil futures  rose 14 cents, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $94.95 a barrel after tumbling 4 percent
on Wednesday.
 Spot gold prices  were last at $1,528.45 an ounce in
choppy trading, down from $1,529.85 in late New York trading
on Wednesday. Gold touched a low of $1,521.90 earlier.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc and a three-week trough against the
dollar on Thursday as political turmoil in Greece and
uncertainty over new aid for the heavily indebted country
intensified.
 More losses could be in store, and the euro looked set to
slide bellow $1.40, analysts said, as long as confusion
persists over how and when policymakers will seal a deal to
meet Greece's immediate funding needs and put the country's
finances on a sustainable path.
 Greek bond prices sank to record lows, while the cost of
insuring Greek sovereign debt for five years jumped to 1,900
basis points, the highest in the world.
 Pressure also grew in the interbank markets as the cost of
raising funds in dollars soared for euro zone banks on fears of
a Lehman-llike lending freeze in the event of a ""disorderly""
Greek default. See [ID:nLDE75F1NR]
 ""The situation in Greece is starting to run away a little
bit and sort of feels like the Bear Stearns/Lehman run up that
we saw in 2007,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director at Faros

 ""We still feel that they can come to the rescue in time,
and it is not out of control completely just yet, but it is
getting dangerously close. All the risk indicators are starting
to show stress,"" he added.
 The euro fell as low as 1.1946 Swiss francs  on
electronic trading platform EBS before climbing back to 1.2026,
down 0.5 percent on the day.
 Seen as a safe-haven currency, the franc brushed off
statements by the Swiss National Bank expressing concern about
its gains, as the bank gave no sign of action that would stem
the currency's upside. [ID:nZCHFHE79L]
 Against the dollar, the euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.4136
, after hitting as low as $1.4071 on Reuters data.
 The euro has lost 3 percent since its June 7 peak near
$1.47, though it remains up nearly 6 percent so far this year.
 Investors are increasingly unsure whether an agreement on a
Greek bailout plan will be reached in the near term. EU and
banking sources told Reuters that Germany wants the deadline
for a second rescue deal to be pushed back to September.
[ID:nLDE75F0WQ]
 BEARISH ACTIVITY
 The euro broke below its 100-day moving average around
$1.4151. A close below that would send a bearish signal,
opening the door for a drop towards May's trough around
$1.3970.
 Analysts also noted bearish options activity on
CurrencyShares Euro Trust , the exchange-traded fund
that tracks the euro/dollar rate. The price of the ETF falls
when the euro weakens against the dollar.
 Traders exchanged about 44,000 options on the ETF, more
than double its average daily volume, according to options
analytics firm Trade Alert. The activity was led by heavy
action in puts, with the September $128 and $123 puts the
busiest options.
 ""It appears to be spread trading where traders are buying
the $128 strike put and selling the $123 strike put, which
would be a very bearish play,"" said WhatsTrading.com options
strategist Frederic Ruffy. For details, see [ID:nN16215598]
 Losses in the euro were limited after a report showed
factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly
shrank to a near two-year low in June, adding to recent
evidence the economic recovery is stalling. [ID:nN16172420]
 Karl Schamotta, senior market strategist at Western Union
Business Solutions in Victoria, British Columbia, said despite
the weak data, ""the reality is the U.S. economy is in a more
stable position than its rivals.
 ""The situation in Europe is under-appreciated, and the U.S.
is set to outperform regardless of how negative things get.""
 The yen also rose because of its perceived safe-haven
status, pushing the dollar down 0.4 percent to 80.69 yen 
and driving the euro  to a one-month low of 113.47
yen.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a
basket of currencies, had risen to 76.015 <.DXY>, a three-week
high.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rose and
the euro stabilized against the dollar on Thursday as investors
tip-toed back into assets that had been beaten down recently by
worries about the Greek debt crisis.
 But even as there were signs of a return in risk appetite,
high-rated government debt rallied on concerns that Greece's
debt woes might spiral into another global financial crisis. In
Europe, shares slid to a three-month low as international
lenders scrambled to save Greece from default.
 But on Wall Street, bargain-hunting investors found ample
opportunity.
 ""A lot of bad news has been priced into the market. People
are taking that into consideration,"" said Randy Billhardt, head
of institutional sales and trading at MLV & Co in New York. ""On
a long-term valuation basis there are some bargains out
there.""
 Analysts, however, downplayed the gains on Wall Street,
which could turn out to be another one-day reprieve -- similar
to the move on Tuesday -- in a longer-term downtrend.
 ""Yesterday was a 'get-me-out' day,"" Robert Zukowski, senior
analyst at 4Cast Ltd in New York said referring to Wednesday's
sell-off. ""The Greek debt situation is not going away.""
 There is growing concern that a ""disorderly"" default from
Greece could roil the worldwide financial system and dry up
lending, similar to what happened after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008.
 The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt for five years
jumped to 1,900 basis points, the highest in the world.
 The growing financial stress from Greece's fiscal
predicament as the euro zone member seeks 125 billion euro in
seen in the jump in yields on Spanish government bonds to an
11-year high and rising borrowing costs in the London interbank
market. For more on Greece's debt crisis see [ID:nL3E7HG0P8].
 For now, investors seemed willing to nibble at cheaper
stocks, overlooking the Greek debt crisis and evidence of rapid
deceleration in U.S. economy activity.
 Wall Street stocks turned higher after a weaker open.
 A gauge of U.S. Mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity slumped
to a near two-year low in June, suggesting U.S. factories were
faltering. But first-time claims for jobless benefits fell
modestly last week and U.S. housing starts rose more than
expected in May. [ID:nN16172420]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 82.87
points, or 0.70 percent, at 11,980.14. The Standard & Poor's

 In Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> closed down

mid-March.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down 0.6

It had wiped out all the gains made this year.
 ""Generally we are trying to stabilize. The markets don't
want to go too far,"" said 4Cast's Zukowski.
 In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei <.N225> closed down 1.7

 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rose and
the euro steadied against the dollar on Thursday as investors
tip-toed back into investments that had been beaten down
recently by worries about the Greek debt crisis.
 Despite some appetite for investments such as stocks and
the euro, concern that Greece's debt woes might spiral into
another global financial crisis have fueled a rally in
high-rated government debt.

 LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled broadly on
Thursday, hitting a record low against the Swiss franc, and was
poised for further losses as investors sought safe-haven assets
on concerns Greece's problems were spiralling out of control.
 Selling in the euro accelerated, sending it to a three-week
low versus the dollar and leaving it on course to drop below
$1.40 as yields on weaker euro zone bonds surged, expanding
their spreads against German Bunds to their widest ever.
[GVD/EUR]
 Violent protests in Athens against government austerity
highlighted the political obstacles to a second bailout, with
Prime Minister George Papandreou forced to reshuffle his cabinet
to salvage his government after resignations by ruling party
lawmakers. [ID:nL3E7HG0P8] 
 Adding to negative euro sentiment were comments from
European Central Bank policymaker Nout Wellink, who was quoted
by a Dutch newspaper as saying the European bailout fund should
be doubled. [ID:nLDE75F03M]
 ""The risk is increasing that Greece may not get a bailout,
and this is putting pressure on the euro,"" said Lutz Karpowitz,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 The euro dropped below 1.20 Swiss francs to plumb a lifetime
low of 1.1957 francs  on electronic trading platform
EBS, falling one percent on the day.
 Seen as a safe-haven currency, the franc brushed off
statements by the Swiss National Bank expressing concern about
its gains, as the bank gave no sign of action that would stem the
currency's upside. [ID:nZCHFHE79L]
 Against the dollar, the euro  fell 0.6 percent to a
session low of $1.4073, its lowest since late May.
 It broke below support around $1.4150, its 100-day moving
average. A close below that level would offer a technical
indication that the euro was vulnerable to more losses, and
analysts said the single currency was poised for a move down to
May's trough of $1.3970.
 ""There's a strong possibility of the euro breaking below
$1.40 and the best way to play euro/dollar right now is to sell
into any strength,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at
Bank of New York Mellon.
 A ramp-up in uncertainty about the Greek debt situation
drove euro/dollar implied volatilities higher, with one-month
volatility jumping to around 14.0 percent , its highest
since November and indicating that movements in the single
currency may become more erratic.
 The premium paid to protect against euro selling has also
surged, with the one-month euro/dollar 25-delta risk reversal
cranking up 1.0 vol to trade around 3.1 in favour of euro puts,
its highest since late May 2010. This indicates a growing euro
downside position in the options market.
 
 BANKING STRAINS?
 The euro's fall supported the dollar against a basket of
currencies, pushing the dollar index <.DXY> up around 0.4
percent to a high of 75.938.
 U.S. data due on Thursday includes weekly jobless claims,
housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed business index. 
The yen also rose due to its perceived safe-haven status,
pushing the dollar down 0.4 percent to 80.70 yen  and the
euro  to a one-month low of 113.50 yen. 
 Investors are increasingly unsure whether an agreement on a
Greek bailout plan will be reached in the near term. EU and
banking sources told Reuters Germany wants the deadline for a
second rescue deal to be pushed back to September, highlighting
the hurdles towards reaching a consensus. [ID:nLDE75F0WQ]
 Concerns about possible strains in the banking sector due to
Greece's debt problems are raising speculation that European
banks could face difficulties in dollar funding. 
 The one-year euro/dollar currency basis swap spread, the
cost of swapping euro into dollar for a year, widened to around
37 basis points  according to Reuters data, the
widest since February, from around 23 basis points on Wednesday.
 Some fund managers said they had recently pared their risky
positions as the Greek debt situation deteriorates while
economic data suggests the global economy may be struggling.
 ""We've been taking risk off across the board,"" said Thanos
Papasavvas, head of FX management at Investec, adding that he
had been ""lightly"" selling euros and sterling, while sitting
tight on his emerging currency positions.
 He acknowledged the latest escalation in investor jitters
about Greece may push the euro below $1.40 in the near term, but
said he was optimistic Greece would form a stable government
and implement the austerity required for it to receive more aid.
 He said he was interested in increasing his risk holdings
later in the year, particularly when signs emerge that the
global economic recovery is picking up steam.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a three-month
low on Thursday, the euro tumbled and top-rated government bonds
rose as investors began to price in a possibility of disorderly
default in Greek sovereign debt.
 Euro zone and banking sources told Reuters Germany wants to
delay the deadline for a second Greek aid package to September,
reflecting disagreement within Europe on how to involve the
private sector in a deal without triggering a default.
[ID:nLDE75F0WQ]
 Political turmoil within Greece is also intensifying fears.
Parliamentary resignations threw the Greek Prime Minister's plan
to reshuffle his cabinet and seek support for an austerity
package into disarray. [ID:nL3E7HG0P8]
A Spanish auction suggested problems might spread. Weak
demand prompted investors to push the country's 10-year yields
to an 11-year high. The cost of insuring sovereign debt in
Greece, Ireland and Portugal against default hit record highs.
 Besides worrying about a potential Greek debt restructuring,
and the repercussions for European banks that hold the country's
bonds, markets also fear that global economic growth momentum is
slowing just as the Federal Reserve prepares to end its $600
billion bond buying programme.
 All this is prompting investors to unwind their risky assets
going into the thin trading of the summer months.
 ""There's political turmoil in Greece, and the government
doesn't look too stable,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency
strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""The risk is increasing that Greece may not get a bailout,
and this is putting pressure on the euro.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.1 percent
to hit its lowest level since mid-March. The index has wiped out
all the gains made this year to fall one percent since January.
 The euro fell as low as $1.4071 , a one-month low. It
hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc .
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 0.8 percent. U.S.
stock futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street later.
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 1.7 percent. Chinese
stocks <.SSEC> hit an 8-1/2 month low as speculation grew about
a potential interest rate hike after the yield on three-month
bills unexpectedly rose at an auction.
 ""The Chinese economy has undoubtedly slowed as a result of
the monetary tightening ... but .. the trough in leading
indicators suggests that the pace of slowdown is moderating,""
said Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital.
 ""As a result the underperformance seen in the first quarter
of those stocks with a high degree of emerging market exposure
should come to an end.""
 
 CONTAGION FEARS
 Bund futures  rose 39 ticks. Spanish 10-year yields
rose as high as 5.75 percent, up over 18 bps on the day.
 ""We've already seen a decent concession going into the
(Spanish) auction so they had to concede quite a substantial
amount to investors in order to get them to buy,"" said WestLB
rate strategist Michael Leister.
 ""As we saw in Greece and the other countries, you can fund
yourself and get liquidity but the crucial issue at some point
in time becomes the price. Here it seems Spain is clearly
heading in the wrong direction.""
 The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt jumped to 1,900
bps, the highest in the world.
 The dollar <.DXY> rose a quarter percent against a basket of
major currencies.
 U.S. crude oil  rose 0.4 percent to $95.21 a barrel.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a three-week
low on Thursday, with a break through key support pointing to
the risk of further losses, as worries grew that Greece's debt
crisis may be spiralling out of control as a new bailout scheme
to keep the country from defaulting remained elusive, while
protests against austerity turned violent in Athens.
 Comments from European Central Bank policy maker Nout
Wellink, reported in a Dutch newspaper, that the European
bailout fund should be doubled helped to trigger a wave of
stop-loss selling orders around $1.4150 in a market already
frayed by a rise in yields on Greek bonds as well as equivalent
Portuguese and Irish spreads.
 ""Investors are getting worried that policymakers can't
agree on measures for Greece. Even though the Greek economy
accounts for only a small part of the euro zone economy, it
could affect the whole European financial system if it is
considered to be in default,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, forex
manager at State Street.
 Concerns about possible strains in the banking sector are
raising speculation that European banks could face difficulty
in dollar funding, with tension already palpable in the
currency swap market.
 The one-year euro/dollar currency basis swap spread, the
cost of swapping euro into dollar for a year, widened to 34
basis points , the widest in three months from
around 23 basis points on Wednesday.
 Though it was still smaller than a peak of around 55 basis
points after the first Greek debt crisis last year, and 120
basis points after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008,
traders said market players are increasingly on edge about
potential fallout from the debt crisis, which seemed close to a
solution, even if a temporary one, just a few weeks ago.
 ""It seems everyone is a bit scared, as no one knows who
would finance it (if the euro aid fund has to be doubled) ...
Speculators, hedge funds and all other investors are offloading
now,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The euro fell to as low as $1.4093 , its lowest in
three weeks, having broken several support levels including its
100-day moving average at $1.4152 and the 76.4 percent
retracement of its May 23-June 7 rally, which stood around
$1.4135, making a return to a May 23 low around $1.3967
increasingly realistic.
 ""Based on our monitoring of institutional investors, they
are still very long in the euro. So there's a chance that more
euro unwinding could be kicking in,"" Tomita added.
 As the euro sags, the dollar index <.DXY> rose to a
three-week high of 75.886, extending gains on top of a 1.7
percent jump on Wednesday -- its biggest one-day percentage
gain since August 2010.
 The dollar looked to be benefiting from risk-aversion,
making gains even as U.S. Treasury yields fell to 2.94 percent
, near a six-month low hit earlier this month, on
worries about banks and following disappointing U.S.
manufacturing and housing data.
 The dollar also held firm against safe-haven currencies
such as the Swiss franc and yen. It kept Wednesday's hefty
gains and traded at 0.8535 francs , putting further
distance from a record trough near 0.8320 marked earlier in the
month.
 For the Swiss franc, the focus is on the Swiss National
Bank, which is expected to keep rates on hold at 0.25 percent
on Thursday. Traders are looking to comments from the bank on
the recent strength of the franc.
 Analysts expect the bank to raise rates by 25 basis points
in September and again in December, but the SNB has been wary
of raising its target for 3-month Swiss franc LIBOR, for fear
of pushing the franc up still further against the euro and the
dollar. [ID:nL9E7F6040]
 Against the yen, the greenback flirted with a two-week high
of 81.06 yen hit on Wednesday, with many players looking to
whether it can stay above 80.89 yen, the base of the Ichimoku
cloud.
 Commodity currencies like the Australian dollar also lost
ground to the U.S. dollar, with even hawkish comments from the
Reserve Bank of Australia on Wednesday providing little support
to the Aussie .
 It fell 0.4 percent to a three-week low of $1.0517.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply on
Thursday after a European central banker said the bail-out fund
for the region's debt crisis should be doubled to 1.5 trillion
euros, accelerating a pullback from riskier assets that knocked
Asian stocks to near three-month lows.	
 Nout Wellink, governing council director of the European
Central Bank, told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad that
a new Greek aid package would carry so many uncertainties and
risks that a doubling in the bail-out fund would be necessary to
take into account the contagion risk for both Ireland and
Portugal. 
 The comments knocked the euro below $1.4100 and cut to the
heart of fears that problems Greece faces with its black hole of
debt could spread to other countries at a time when the U.S.
economy may be slowing, the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond
purchase programme is ending and some investors are second
guessing emerging market assets in countries such as China.	
 The euro was down 0.5 percent to $1.4094 by early
afternoon in Asia, having fallen almost 3 cents so far this
week.	
 The U.S. dollar index , which tracks its performance
against six other major currencies, rose 0.5 percent to the
highest since May 26.	
 Oil prices staged a weak rebound after dropping sharply
overnight, though volatile markets suggested crude could resume
a decline before long. 
 Investors have been re-positioning their portfolios with an
eye on the litany of risks ahead of U.S. data later in the day
that included May housing starts, weekly jobless claims and the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia business outlook survey.
.	
 ""There is very clearly an environment now in which risk is
off and to that investors shy away from obvious risk on assets
such as equities and high beta currencies,"" said John Woods,
managing director and chief investment strategist with Citi
Private Bank.	
 Woods told Reuters Television that he has been advising that
his clients look at local currency bond markets in Asia that
have been resilient to pressures coming from the euro zone and
still offer relatively high yield.	
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said he will form a
new cabinet on Thursday and seek a vote of confidence from his
fractious Socialist party to push through a harsh austerity
bill, as riot police battled tens of thousands of protesters in
the heart of Athens. 
 
 UNCERTAINTY MAGNIFIED	
 Greece must pass a new campaign of tax rises and spending
cuts to receive a new EU/IMF bailout and a 12 billion euro aid
tranche that Athens needs to pay back debt that matures in
August. But many analysts and economists believe it is bound to
default on its debt sooner or later.	
 ""Greece is like a Lehman Brothers situation, except a
country version,"" said Tanrich Securities' Vice-President
Jackson Wong in Hong Kong. ""It's magnifying uncertainty right
now, even though most banks don't have much exposure to the euro
debt situation."" 
 In Japan, the Nikkei fell 1.7 percent, with
growth-sensitive shares such Canon and Mazda Motor
underperforming.	
 Other Asian markets also retreated, with the MSCI Asia
Pacific ex-Japan index sliding 2.4 percent.
Shares of materials and technology companies were among the
weakest performers on fears of faltering global growth.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped 1.9 percent to
its lowest level this year, with shares of HSBC ,
Europe's top lender, falling 1.5 percent and weighing on the
broader market. 
 Samsonite International SA , the world's biggest
luggage maker, dropped 11 percent in its Hong Kong trading debut
on Thursday, reflecting weak investor appetite for initial
public offerings. 
 Foreign bearishness about Chinese equities, partly over
corporate governance issues, have made investors increasingly
cagey about the outlook for the Hang Seng with short-selling
seeing a pick-up to levels last seen eight months ago.	
 In commodities markets, oil prices   recovered
in Asian trade after a more than 4 percent slide in the U.S.
session as the rising dollar and signs of further economic
weakness fed demand worries. 
 August Brent crude futures jumped more than a
dollar, topping $114 a barrel, in the wake of a
larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stocks.

 HONG KONG, June 16 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid to their

bill, as riot police battled tens of thousands of protesters in
the heart of Athens. 
 Greece must pass the new campaign of tax rises and spending
cuts to receive a new EU/IMF bailout and a 12 billion euro aid
tranche that Athens needs to pay back debt that matures in
August.	
 Euro zone officials, meanwhile, said a new three-year
financing programme for Greece may be delayed until next month
due to differences over how to involve private investors.

 The euro fell to $1.4154 , lows not seen since May 27,
before recovering a bit of ground to $1.4190, little changed
from late Thursday levels, and finding support around its
100-day moving average.	
 A further test of the euro zone will come later in the day
by way of a government bond auction in Spain, another country
struggling with budget deficits, unemployment and social unrest.

 Escalating tensions in the euro zone and data showing the
U.S. economy is facing a troubling mix of weaker growth and
higher prices triggered heavy selling on Wall Street, adding to
pressure on Asian equity markets and other riskier assets on
Thursday. 
 ""We have got used to fairly disappointing data from the
U.S., so I think today's fall is mostly prompted mostly by euro
zone problems,"" said Takashi Ohba, a senior strategist at Okasan
Securities. 
 In Japan, the Nikkei fell 1.1 0.9 percent, with
growth-sensitive shares such Canon and Mazda Motor
underperforming.	
 Other Asian markets also retreated, with the MSCI Asia
ex-Japan index down 1.7 percent. Shares of
materials and technology companies were among the weakest
performers on fears of faltering global growth.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell through a key chart
support at its March low, slumping 1.5 percent to its lowest
level this year. 
 Foreign bearishness about Chinese equities, partly over
corporate governance issues, have made investors increasingly
cagey about the outlook for the Hang Seng with short-selling
seeing a pick-up to levels last seen eight months ago.	
 In commodities markets, oil prices   recovered
in Asian trade after a more than 4 percent slide in the U.S.
session as the rising dollar and signs of further economic
weakness fed demand worries. 
 August Brent crude futures jumped $1.56, topping
$114 a barrel, in the wake of a slightly recovering euro and a
larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stocks. 
 Gold lost its footing on dollar strength.	
 Spot gold fell $3.32 an ounce to $1,526.5 an ounce
after rising for a second straight session to around $1,533 on
Wednesday as equity markets tumbled. Gold is well below a
lifetime high around $1,575 touched in early May.	
 U.S. data later in the day includes housing starts, jobless
claims and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia business
outlook survey.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
slumped on Wednesday as upheaval in highly indebted Greece and
indecision among Europe's leaders about helping the nation fed
fears the euro zone member is edging closer to default.
 The euro tumbled 2 percent against the dollar and
government debt of the United States and Germany rallied on a
safety bid after euro zone finance ministers failed to agree on
how to involve private investors in a second financial rescue
for Greece.
 Senior EU officials said a deal was now unlikely to be
reached at a summit next week and was likely to be delayed
until mid-July.
 ""It had looked like we were making progress on addressing
Greece's problems but now it seems things are fraying at the
edges. People are capitulating, taking a defensive posture and
getting out of their risky trades."" said George Davis, senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 The dollar's strengthening against the euro helped propel a
more than 4 percent slide in the price of U.S. crude oil, hurt
also by further signs of economic weakness.
 In the United States, dismal manufacturing and housing data
intensified fears of slowing growth.
 ""There are plenty of things you can pick to be worried
about,"" said John Wilson, chief equity strategist at Morgan
Keegan at Chattanooga, Tennessee. ""You are seeing a
capitulation and market sentiment is getting more negative.""
 Investors recoiled at the latest developments less than 24
hours after they had tip-toed back into stocks and other risky
assets. Wednesday's flight out of growth-driven investments
pushed the euro and U.S. stock indexes down near key technical
support levels.
 Bank shares led the global sell-off after Moody's Investors
Service said it may put the credit ratings of French banks BNP
Paribas , Credit Agricole and Societe
Generale  on review for a possible downgrade, citing
the banks' holdings of Greek public and private debt.
 The rating agency later placed the ratings of some units of
Portuguese banks in Brazil on review for possible downgrade.
 The MSCI world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> sagged 1.9
percent a day after posting its biggest single-day percentage
rise in two weeks due to less-grim economic data from China and
the United States.
 On Wall Street, stocks erased Tuesday's gains, which had
temporarily slowed a six-week sell-off.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 178.84
points, or 1.48 percent, at 11,897.27. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> ended down 22.45 points, or 1.74 percent, at
1,265.42. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> finished down
47.26 points, or 1.76 percent, at 2,631.46.
 Top European shares <.FTEU3> lost 1.1 percent on the day,
while Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> ended 0.3 percent lower following
Tuesday's rally in New York.
 STOCKS VULNERABLE
 As more evidence of an economic slowdown is likely to
emerge, some analysts see a further decline in stocks.
 ""Even if it's in a soft patch, the slope of the U.S.
recovery will still be disappointing and it will be an uneven
performance,"" said Clark Yingst, chief market analyst at Joseph
Gunnar in New York.
 The expiration of the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond
program, known as QE2, at month's-end and disappointing
quarterly company results could put additional selling pressure
on stocks in the near term, Yingst said.
 He forecasts the S&P 500 could fall 11-20 percent from its
peak in early May.
 Meanwhile, tens of thousands of protesters in Greece raged
against a new wave of austerity after euro zone finance
ministers failed to agree how to make private creditors
contribute to a second bailout. Greece is seeking 120 billion
euros in fresh aid.
 The onus has now shifted to the leaders of Germany and
France to forge a deal later this week.
 Prime Minister George Papandreou offered to quit and make
way for a national unity government. For more, see
[ID:nLDE75E0JC]
 ""A resolution has to be met at some point in time,"" said
John McCarthy, director of currency trading at ING Capital
Markets in New York. ""Greece can't continue along its current
path, we all know that. The question is, 'What is the
resolution?'""
 The latest twists in Greece's predicament, combined with
Moody's warning on French banks, knocked the euro lower.
 The single-currency  fell 2 percent against the
dollar to $1.4178, for its worst day in more than a month.
 Investor jitters rekindled a flight into low-risk U.S. and
German government bonds.
 The stampede into bonds knocked benchmark 10-year Treasury
yields  back below 3 percent, putting them on track
for their biggest one-day drop since September. The 10-year
U.S. yield touched a two-week high on Tuesday.
 German Bund futures  ended up 0.7 percent near a
contract high set earlier at 126.35.
 Safety bids also lifted gold prices. Spot bullion was last
at $1,530.50 an ounce, up from $1,523.25 on Tuesday.
 Increased risk aversion wiped out earlier gains in oil.
U.S. oil prices  fell $4.59 to settle at $94.81 a barrel
after rising earlier on government data showing an unexpectedly
large 3.41-million-barrel drop in crude inventory.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a
2-1/2-week low against the dollar on Wednesday, heading for its
worst day in more than a month as investors fretted about the
lack of resolution of Greece's debt crisis and the effect a
default could have on European banks.
 Euro zone ministers failed on Tuesday to reach agreement on
how private holders of Greek debt should share the costs of a
new bailout. Uncertainty over a second rescue for Athens and
fears of contagion pushed the bond yields of Greece, Ireland
and Portugal to euro lifetime highs.
 Adding to investor unease, Moody's threatened large French
banks with possible downgrades. The ratings agency also said it
was reviewing ratings of subsidiaries of some Portuguese banks
for possible downgrades.
 ""The market is really caught in a tailspin at the moment,""
said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at OANDA in
Toronto. ""Nobody seems to be in control. It really is down to
the finance ministers and the European Central Bank coming to
some sort of solution and they seem to be so far apart at the
moment.""
 Senior EU officials said a deal was unlikely to be reached
at a summit next week and was likely to be delayed until
mid-July.
 The euro fell as low as $1.4154  on Reuters data
before rebounding to last trade at $1.4175, down 1.8 percent on
the day. At current prices it was on track for its biggest
daily percentage drop since early May.
 Technical traders said the euro is set to extend declines
toward $1.40, with little strong support seen before that key
psychological level.
 George Davis, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said the euro/dollar's trendline drawn off
the lows from the start of the year and the lows hit last month
comes in at $1.4167.
 ""That's been guiding the euro higher throughout 2011, so if
we're able to close below that, it would be a very bearish
development,"" he said. ""People will abandon the buy-on-dips
mentality and start to sell the euro on rallies.""
 The euro also fell 0.9 percent against the safe-haven Swiss
franc to 1.2089 francs , though it stayed above record
lows hit earlier in the week when it did not break below hefty
options barriers at 1.2000.

 DOLLAR BROADLY STRONGER
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Wednesday he
will form a new government on Thursday and seek a vote of
confidence from his parliamentary group.
 Earlier in the day, tens of thousands of protesters marched
on parliament to oppose his austerity plans. Unions
representing half the 5-million-strong work force also launched
a nationwide strike. See [ID:nLDE75E041]
 In the options market, risk reversals showed increasing
demand for bets on a lower euro against the dollar. The 25
delta one-month euro/dollar risk reversal  traded
at around 2.2 in favor of euro puts.
 ""Our option desk is seeing a continuation of the
large-scale euro put buying they witnessed yesterday,
principally in the one-month and two-month area, with $1.40
strikes proving very popular,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank in
London.
 Worries about Greece prompted investors to flock to the
safe-haven U.S. dollar. The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks
its performance against a basket of currencies, was up 1.6
percent at 75.541, posting its biggest one-day rise since
August 2010.
 However, concerns over the failure so far of lawmakers and
officials to lift the U.S. debt ceiling are expected to limit
dollar gains.
 The dollar was up 0.6 percent at 80.87 yen . It also
rose about 1 percent against the Swiss franc , Canadian
dollar  and Australian dollar .

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Stocks and the euro fell on
Wednesday and safe-haven government bonds rose as divisions
between euro zone officials over a new aid plan for debt-heavy
Greece curbed demand for growth-driven investments.
 In the United States, weaker-than-expected manufacturing
and housing data renewed worries over slowing growth, while
figures that signaled the biggest rise in core consumer prices
in nearly three years caused some to reconsider how long
inflation pressure will remain tame in the absence of policy
tightening from the Federal Reserve. For more details, see

 STOCKS VULNERABLE
 As more evidence of an economic slowdown is likely to
emerge, some analysts predict a further decline in stocks.
 ""Even if it's in a soft patch, the slope of the U.S.
recovery will still be disappointing and it will be an uneven
performance,"" said Clark Yingst, chief market analyst at Joseph
Gunnar in New York.
 The expiration of the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond
program, known as QE2, at month-end and disappointing quarterly
company results could put additional selling pressure on stocks
in the near term, Yingst said.
 He forecasts the S&P 500 could fall 11 percent to 20
percent from its peak in early May.
 Meanwhile, striking Greeks raged against a new wave of
austerity after euro zone finance ministers failed to agree how
to make private creditors contribute to a second bailout for
their indebted country. This shifted the onus onto the leaders
of Germany and France to forge a deal later this week.
 The turmoil in Greece, which is seeking 120 billion euros
in fresh aid, intensified on Wednesday. The leader of Greece's
conservative opposition has asked Prime Minister George
Papandreou to stand down and agree to a commonly accepted new
head of government, a source from the New Democracy party told
Reuters. For more, [see:ID:nATH006157]
 The latest twists in Greece's predicament, combined with
Moody's warning on French banks, knocked the euro lower.
 The currency  slid 1 percent against the dollar,
sending it close to a recent low of $1.4285 hit on trading
platform EBS. It was last down 0.9 percent at $1.42876,
breaking below its 21-day moving average, with traders citing
selling from leveraged and real money accounts.
 Investor jitters rekindled a flight into low-risk U.S. and
German government bonds.
 Improved demand for bonds lowered benchmark 10-year
Treasury yields  to 3.05 percent, down 5 basis
points on the day. German Bund futures  were up 0.4
percent at 125.91.
 U.S. oil prices turned higher on government data showing an
unexpectedly large 3.41-million-barrel drop in crude inventory.
This suggests oil demand by the world's biggest energy consumer
has held up despite signs of slowing economic activity.
 A stronger dollar had earlier fueled selling in oil.
 The spot NYMEX oil contract  in New York last traded
up 21 cents at $99.58 a barrel. In London, July Brent crude
futures  were down $1.52 at $118.64 a barrel.
 Spot gold prices  were at $1,530.94 an ounce, up from
$1,523.25 on Tuesday, as buying on euro zone sovereign debt
concern overcame earlier selling from a stronger dollar.

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Stocks and the euro fell on
Wednesday and safe-haven government bonds rose as divisions
between euro zone officials over a new aid plan for debt-heavy
Greece curbed demand for growth-driven investments.
 In the United States, weaker-than-expected manufacturing
and housing data renewed worries over slowing growth, while a

nearly three years caused some investors to reconsider how long
inflation pressure will remain tame in the absence of policy
tightening from the Federal Reserve. For more, see

 Anxiety over the Greek debt crisis and disappointing U.S.
data put downward pressure on global equity markets, bogged
down by bank shares. Moody's Investors Service said it may
downgrade the credit ratings of French banks BNP Paribas,
Credit Agricole and Societe Generale to on review for a
possible downgrade, citing the French banks' holdings of Greek

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Wednesday after euro zone ministers failed to reach agreement
on how to tackle the Greek debt crisis and Moody's threatened
large French banks with possible downgrades.
 A report showed U.S. core inflation rose more than expected
in May to post its largest increase in three years, bolstering
the dollar, though events in Europe continued to dominate
market sentiment.
 The increased investor aversion to risk triggered by the
debt crisis continued to push the euro  down by as much
as 1 percent on the day.
 Traders said Asian sovereign names and leveraged and real
money accounts were behind the selling.
 Analysts said a Greek national strike against austerity
measures was also keeping the euro lower as it highlighted the
country's outrage against the government's efforts to reign in
its debts, while ongoing divisions about a debt assistance plan
underlined the possibility of the debt issues spreading to
other euro zone countries.
 ""A resolution has to be met at some point in time,"" said
John McCarthy, director of currency trading at ING Capital
Markets. ""Greece can't continue along its current path, we all
know that. The question is what is the resolution.""
 In early New York trading, the euro was at $1.4283,
hovering around the session low.
 The single currency was down 0.4 percent against the
safe-haven Swiss franc at 1.2150 francs , though it
stayed above record lows hit earlier in the week when it did
not break below hefty options barriers at $1.2000.
 Euro zone finance ministers failed on Tuesday to reach
agreement on how private holders of Greek debt should share the
costs of a new bailout. [ID:nLDE75E03B]
 Investor concerns were exacerbated as Moody's rating agency
said it was reviewing the ratings of BNP Paribas SA, France's
biggest bank, Societe Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA,
because of their exposure to Greek debt. [ID:nL3E7HF0A4].
 <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The single currency was also hurt by a Financial Times
report that the German-inspired Greek debt rescheduling plan
could force euro zone governments to provide up to an extra 20
billion euros for the financial sector. [ID:nWNA1032]
 BOLSTERING BEARISH BETS
 Options traders reported increasing demand for bearish bets
on the euro via put options as feuding over Greece's rescue
continued.
 Risk reversals showed increasing demand for bets on a lower
euro against the dollar. The 25 delta one-month euro/dollar
risk reversal  hit levels not seen since
December, trading at around 2.0 in favor of euro puts. 
 ""Our option desk is seeing a continuation of the large
scale euro put buying they witnessed yesterday, principally in
the one-month and two-month area, with $1.40 strikes proving
very popular,"" a trader at a U.S. bank in London said.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks its performance
against a basket of currencies, was up 1 percent at 75.104.
 However, concerns over the failure of lawmakers and
officials to lift the U.S. debt ceiling are expected to limit
dollar gains.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned on
Tuesday the United States could lose its AAA credit rating and
the dollar's status as a reserve currency could be damaged if
there was no quick resolution on raising the debt limit.
[ID:nN14186233]
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 80.82 yen , within
the prevailing 79.50-81.00 yen range, though it climbed to a
session high of 81.06 after the CPI report.
 The Australian dollar  held at $1.0650. Earlier, it
rose to $1.0715 as the Reserve Bank of Australia governor said
an increase in interest rates is still needed to restrain
inflation. [ID:nS9E7H700T]

lift to offset any potential boost to bulllion from rising
investor concern over inflation.
 By 1237 GMT, spot gold  was down 0.52 percent on the

 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - European equities and the euro
fell on Wednesday and safe-haven government bonds rose as
divisions between euro zone officials over a new aid plan for
debt-laden Greece curbed appetite for risky assets.
 Worry about lack of substantive progress towards a blueprint
for tackling the euro zone debt crisis kept investors on edge,
pushing Greek, Portuguese and Irish bond yields to their highest
levels since the introduction of the euro in 1999.
 Striking Greeks raged against a new wave of austerity after
euro zone finance ministers failed to agree how to make private
creditors contribute to a second bailout for their indebted
country. [ID:nLDE75E0JC]
 This put the onus on the leaders of Germany and France to
forge a deal later this week. [ID:nLDE75D0G6]
 Selling pressure on the euro also increased after Moody's
put BNP Paribas , Credit Agricole  and Societe
Generale  on review for a possible downgrade, citing
the French banks' holdings of Greek public and private debt.
 That warning depressed European banking stocks, pushing the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares 0.2
percent lower.
""At some stage they (EU politicians) are going to have to
grasp the nettle (on Greece). A lot of that is dependent on the
banks being strong enough to take the hit,"" said Justin Urquhart
Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management. ""The euro is
damaged -- the people operating it don't want to change it.""
 The euro fell nearly one percent against the dollar, sending
it close to a recent low of $1.4285 hit on trading platform EBS.
 It was last 0.9 percent down at $1.4312 , breaking
below its 21-day moving average with traders cited selling from
leveraged and real money accounts.
 ""The market is definitely getting jittery about Greece, and
rating agencies looking at European bank exposure to Athens is
not going to help,"" a London-based trader said.
 The euro also inched back towards a record low against the
Swiss franc , hit on Friday and below 1.2 euro.
 
 SOUR MOOD
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.4
percent, with some strategists saying more weakness could be in
store for European shares.
 ""The easiest way for markets to deal with uncertainty is to
go down,"" said Philip Isherwood, European equities strategist at
Evolution Securities.
 The sour mood in equities prompted gains in safe-haven U.S.
and German government bond prices, pushing 10-year T-note yields
about two basis points lower to 3.082 percent with equivalent
Bund yields  down one bp at 3.01 percent.
 The yield premiums of Greek, Portuguese and Irish bonds over
benchmark German Bunds hit euro-era peaks and the cost of
insuring the debt scaled record highs on a lack of political
consensus on how to resolve Greece's debt problems.
 ""Hopes get dashed more and more that we won't get a
waterproof solution by the end of next week. This is placing
another big layer of uncertainty over everything and it sounds
like you don't want to be that much invested in the periphery at
the moment,"" said Commerzbank strategist David Schnautz.

 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro weakened on Wednesday,
as euro zone ministers failed to reach agreement on how to
tackle the Greek debt crisis and Moody's threatened large French
banks with possible downgrades.
 The euro looked poised to test last week's low against the
dollar around $1.4320, with traders citing sovereign and macro
fund selling above $1.4400.
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4364 , hovering
just above its 21-day moving average at $1.4353, with bids cited
around $1.4340-50 and more at $1.4320-25 seen capping losses in
the short term. Stop loss orders were reported at $1.4350.
 ""I wouldn't expect the euro to fall very sharply.
Positioning is a bit long euro/dollar but not extreme and we're
unlikely to see a squeeze moving it rapidly lower,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.

 ""The problem is not the fact that Greece is likely to face
some form of a default. The problem is that the debate over the
involvement of private investors in the rescue scheme drags on,
making market participants jittery,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency
analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The euro came off a high hit in Asian trade of $1.4451 on
EBS trading platform after Tuesday's better-than-expected U.S.
retail sales and Chinese inflation data boosted risk appetite. 
 The single currency was steady against the safe-haven Swiss
franc at 1.2204 francs , holding after failing to break
below hefty options barriers at $1.2000 earlier in the week.
Investors were wary ahead of a Swiss National Bank policy
meeting on Thursday.
 
 BOLSTERING BEARISH BETS
 The debate over Greece's rescue prompted hedge funds to
bolster bearish bets on the single currency via put options as
they expected more negative headlines in coming days.
 Risk reversals show increasing demand for bets on a lower
euro against the dollar. The 25 delta one-month euro/dollar risk
reversal  hit levels not seen since December,
trading at around 2.1 in favour of euro puts.
 ""They have been buying substantial amounts of long-term euro
put options,"" a trader at a Japanese bank in Tokyo said, adding
strikes were at around $1.40 with tenors of one to two months.
 ""Funds seem to be positioning to buy back the greenback.""
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks its performance
against a basket of currencies, was up 0.5 percent at 74.701.
 But dollar gains were limited by concerns over lawmakers and
officials failure to lift the U.S. debt ceiling.
 U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke warned the United
States could lose its AAA credit rating while the dollar's
status as a reserve currency could be damaged if there was no
quick resolution on raising the debt limit. [ID:nN14186233]
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 80.60 yen , well
within the prevailing 79.50-81.00 yen range.
 The Australian dollar  was up 0.1 percent at
$1.0693, after rising above $1.0700 as the Reserve Bank of

pressure in Asia on Wednesday as worry about euro zone debt
intensified, prompting a move away from riskier assets which
helped gold extend gains.	
 Asian stocks outside Japan were largely flat. Markets
generally opened higher as positive data from the world's two
largest economies encouraged investors to buy into
growth-sensitive assets.	
 But later, concern about the global outlook and the Greek
debt crisis made indexes slip. Shares in Japan and Korea rose.	
 European stocks were expected to inch lower early on
Wednesday as investors' appetite for riskier assets was seen
falling after the euro zone ministers failed to finalise the
Greek deal. 
 The ministers were unable to agree on how private
holders of Greek debt should share the costs of a new bailout,
putting the onus on the leaders of Germany and France to forge a
deal later this week. 
 Selling pressure also increased as Moody's placed Credit
Agricole, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale on review for a
possible downgrade, focusing on their holdings of Greek public
and private debt. 
 Oil fell on Wednesday as the dollar strengthened
after the failure to strike a Greek agreement, while rising
gasoline stockpiles in the United States signalled fuel demand
is stalling.	
 The euro was also hurt by a report in the Financial Times
saying the German-inspired Greek debt rescheduling plan could
force euro zone governments to provide up to an extra 20 billion
euro. The currency earlier came under pressure having failed to
break through $1.4500 . 
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark
said on Wednesday that debt relief from private banks to Greece
must be on a voluntary basis, otherwise a contagion could break
out on financial markets. 
 ""The problem is not the fact that Greece is likely to face
some form of a default. The problem is that the debate over the
involvement of private investors in the rescue scheme drags on,
making market participants jittery,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency
analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 
 
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.4414 after reaching an
Asian session high of $1.4451 early on Wednesday after
better-than-expected U.S. retail sales and Chinese inflation
data boosted risk appetite the day before. 
The euro briefly dipped below support at $1.4410 and decent
support was seen at $1.4375, with traders talking about good
size stops at $1.4350. It also inched back towards a record low
against the Swiss franc hit on Friday below 1.2 euro.	
The dollar bought 80.50 yen , still well within the
prevailing 79.50-81.00 yen range, where the pair seems to have
stabilised after falling from an April peak around 85.50. 
The Australian dollar briefly popped above $1.0700
after the Reserve Bank of Australia governor said an increase in
interest rates was still likely to be needed to restrain
inflation.

 GOLD GAINS	
 Safe haven gold extended its gains amid the move out of
risky assets and after data showing strong economic growth in
China stoked fears of inflation, and as U.S. retail sales fell
less than forecast.	
 Chinese data showed the world's second biggest economy may
avoid a hard landing as some had feared, while a U.S. consumer
spending report that was not as weak as expected lifted U.S.
stocks , oil and other growth-oriented markets on Tuesday.	
 Spot gold was trading slightly firmer at $1,524.64
after rising to $1,525.50 earlier. It is well below a high
around $1,575 touched in early May. 
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average ended 0.28 percent
higher while the broader Topix posted a similar gain.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was off 0.1 percent.	
 The Korea Composite Stock Price Index gained 0.5
percent.	
 Brent crude for August , which will become the
front-month contract after July expires at the end of Wednesday
trade, shed 24 cents to $119.11 a barrel by 0439 GMT, while July
U.S. crude slipped 30 cents to $99.07.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Chinese data showing strong
economic growth in the world's second biggest economy and U.S.
consumer spending report that was not as weak as feared lifted
stocks, oil and other growth-oriented markets on Tuesday.
 In the currency market, investors drove up the euro after
Greece managed to raise cash by selling bills on Tuesday, even
though Greece became Standard and Poor's lowest-rated sovereign
borrower on Monday.
 The renewed appetite for risk, however, hammered government
bonds with U.S. benchmark yields recording their biggest
single-day jump in more than five months.
 China's industrial output grew 13 percent in May from a
year ago and inflation accelerated to 5.2 percent its fastest
in almost three years, but its central bank raised the reserve
requirement ratio for commercial lenders by 50 basis points for
the ninth time in an effort to control rising prices. See
[ID:nL3E7HE05P]
 The determination of Chinese authorities to bring the 5.2
percent inflation rate down, raised hopes they could gradually
cool local wage increases and its red-hot property market
without sacrificing much in overall economic growth.
 ""Based on the data overnight, the odds are favoring a soft
landing. It's making people more optimistic,"" said Brian
Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds
Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, which oversees $400
billion in assets. ""Sometimes no bad news is good news.""
 In the United States, retail sales in May fell for the
first time 11 months, but the drop was less than expected,
signaling the resilience of American consumers despite sluggish
job growth and a lousy housing market. [ID:nN14189765]
 The U.S. stock market jumped, with the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 123.14 points, or 1.03 percent, at
12,076.11. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 16.04
points, or 1.26 percent, at 1,287.87. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> was up 39.03 points, or 1.48 percent, at
2,678.72.
 The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage rise
since March, shaving its month-to-date loss to 4 percent.
 Top European stocks <.FTEU3> gained 0.8 percent, while
Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> ended 1.0 percent higher.
 Nikkei futures in Chicago <2NKc1> ended at 9,435, compared
with its Osaka close  of 9,570.
 Some analysts cautioned the gains in stocks and could be
short-lived as sovereign debt problems in Europe and the United
States fester and the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond
program, which has helped support financial markets, expires at
the end of June.
 ""It's the long term trend which is still disturbing. If you
look at the S&P 500 they've lost over $1 trillion in value
since the beginning of May -- that is telling,"" said Alan
Valdes, director of floor operations at DME Securities in New
York. ""We were so oversold you had to see a plus day.""
 U.S. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking at an event
sponsored by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,
warned that a failure to increase the government's $14.3
trillion debt ceiling would risk United States' coveted
AAA-rating and damage the U.S. dollar's status as a reserve
currency. For more, see [ID:nW1E7GV02N]
 GREECE SELLS DEBT
 Also reducing investor anxiety was Greece's ability to
raise short-term funds after Standard & Poor's downgraded its
rating closer to default territory. [ID:nN13126859]
 Greece sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.33 billion) of 6-month
T-bills at a yield of 4.96 percent, which was higher than May.
But the bill auction attracted more foreign buyers, reflecting
market expectations Greece will secure a second rescue package
worth about 120 billion euros to stave off default.
 On the other hand, the five-year cost of insuring against a
Greek default rose to a record peak of 1,615 basis points, as
did the yield on Greek government bonds. [ID:nLDE75D0ZT]
 Greece's trials did little to discourage investors from
buying the euro a day after it hit a record low against the
Swiss franc .
 The Swiss currency, which falls when investors turn away
from safe havens, declined more than 0.9 percent versus the
euro and the U.S. dollar.
 The euro rose to $1.4480 against the greenback, up 0.5
percent on the day .
 Investors also channeled money into commodities at the
expense of government bonds.
 ICE Brent July crude  closed up 90 cents to $120.00
a barrel, touching its highest level in more than five weeks.
U.S. oil futures  ended up 2 percent at $99.20.
 Spot gold  rose to $1,524.70 an ounce in New York
from $1,514.73 on Monday when it suffered its biggest one-day
loss in a month, touching a three-week low of $1,511.11.
 A sell-off in the U.S. government bond market pushed
benchmark yields to their highest level in almost two weeks at
3.09 percent. German Bund futures fell 49 basis points at
125.45 after posting a contract high of 126.11 on Monday.

 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Chinese data showing the
world's second biggest economy might be able to avoid a hard
landing and U.S. retail sales data that was not as weak as
feared lifted stocks, oil and other growth-oriented markets on
Tuesday.
 In the currency market, emboldened investors drove up the

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose for a second
day against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, buoyed by an increase
in risk appetite, though gains could be fleeting on nagging
worries over Greece's debt crisis.
 Encouraging Chinese and U.S. economic data lifted stocks,
oil and other growth-oriented markets. That also boosted gains
in higher-yielding, commodity-linked currencies such as the
Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 Traders remained cautious the single currency remained a
sell on rallies, owing to Greece's debt crisis and uncertainty
over how much the private sector will be involved in a new
financial aid package for Athens.
 ""The temporary calming in market conditions is the key
driver in FX moves,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency
strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""The European debt crisis hasn't exactly disappeared as a
market issue, but with no new significant headlines, it is
having a lesser impact on the euro for today at least.""
 The euro  hit a session high of $1.4498 on
electronic trading platform EBS, before easing back to $1.4479,
up 0.4 percent for the day.
 Technical traders said the break back above the 55-day
moving average at $1.44062 was a positive sign, suggesting the
euro could run a bit further in the very short term. Resistance
is seen around $1.4520, the high in mid-April.
 Euro zone finance ministers meet to discuss on Tuesday how
private Greek bondholders should be involved in a second
financing package for the debt-laden country ahead of a
self-imposed June 20 deadline for a deal. No decisions are
expected on Tuesday. For details, see [ID:nLDE75D0JH]
 Debt issued by peripheral economies were under broad
pressure as Greek, Portuguese and Irish 10-year bond yields hit
fresh euro lifetime highs. Traders expect yields to rise
further, at least until details of a new bailout package for
Greece are agreed.
 European policymakers struggled to sort out their
differences over Greece with the stand-off between German
officials and the European Central Bank over the prospect of a
""voluntary"" debt rollover threatening a resolution.
 On Monday, Standard & Poor's slashed Greece's credit rating
to CCC, making the country its lowest rated in the world.
[ID:nN13126859]
 ""The euro remains a sell on rallies as there is still a
very high risk of growth momentum slowing down. Also, problems
in the periphery should not be underestimated as Germany will
stick to its stance on Greece and there is a risk of technical
default,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst at UBS in
Zurich.

 The Australian dollar  was up 0.9 percent at

 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Encouraging Chinese and U.S.
economic data lifted stocks, oil and other growth-oriented
markets on Tuesday, while Greece managed to raise cash in a
debt auction even after it became S&P's lowest-rated sovereign
borrower.
 Data from China showing the world's second biggest economy
could avoid a hard landing amid efforts to prevent it from
overheating renewed the market's appetite for risk. That also
boosted oil, gold and other commodity prices but put downward
pressure on prices for low-risk government bonds.
 China's inflation accelerated to its fastest level in

 Greece sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.33 billion) of 6-month
T-bills at a yield of 4.96 percent. This was higher than May's
4.88 percent but attracted a larger percentage of foreign
buyers than the previous auction, reflecting market
expectations Greece will secure a second rescue package worth
about 120 billion euros to stave off default.
 On the other hand, the cost of insuring Greek debt against
default over five years rose to record peak of 1,615 basis

 The euro rebounded a day after it hit a record low against
the Swiss franc . The Swiss currency, which falls
when investors turn away from safe havens, declined more than
0.8 percent versus the euro and the U.S. dollar.
 The euro rose to $1.4480 against the greenback, up 0.5
percent on the day  after weakening briefly in reaction
to the less grim U.S. retail sales report.
 Investors also channeled money into commodities at the
expense of government bonds.
 ICE Brent July crude  rose $1.18 to $120.25 a

U.S. oil futures  were up 0.6 percent at $97.96.

$1,514.73 on Monday when it suffered its biggest one-day loss
in a month, touching a three-week low of $1,511.11.
 A sell-off in the U.S. government bond markets pushed
benchmark yields to their highest level in almost two weeks at
3.08 percent. German Bund futures fell 48 basis points at
125.45 after posting a contract high of 126.11 on Monday.

 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Encouraging Chinese and U.S.

 LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro and high-yielding
currencies rose on Tuesday, boosted by improved risk appetite
after Chinese data eased global growth concerns and taking a
hike in Chinese banks' reserve requirements in their stride.
 Traders said the single currency looked a sell on rallies,
however, owing to Greece's debt crisis and uncertainty over how
much the private sector will be involved in a new aid package
for Athens.
 China raised banks' reserve requirements by 50 basis points,
a move that saw the Australian dollar  shed some of its
earlier gains and weighed marginally on the single currency.
[ID:nL3E7HE05P]
 Chinese inflation surged to its highest in 34 months, and
taken together with the reserve requirement hike, analysts said
the authorities there were trying to engineer a soft landing for
the economy. That could benefit risk in the near term, with
European stocks holding on to solid gains <.FTEU3> while U.S.
stock futures pointed to a firm start.
 ""There is no doubt the Chinese are trying to engineer a soft
landing for the economy,"" said Gavin Friend, currency analyst at
NAB Capital. ""Risk appetite is supporting the euro but what it
really needs is a quick resolution to the Greek debt crisis for
a push higher.""
 The euro  hit a session high of $1.4473 on the EBS
trading platform before easing back to $1.4432, up 0.1 percent
for the day. Traders said sovereign accounts were selling above
$1.4450.
 Technical traders said the break back above the 55-day
moving average at $1.4405 was a positive sign, while next
resistance was at $1.4508, the 50 percent retracement of this
month's sell-off.

 DOLLAR AWAITS U.S. RETAIL SALES
 The market is now turning its attention to inflation figures
in other parts of the world, and most importantly to May data on
U.S. retail sales for signs on whether the sudden slowdown in
the economy is hampering household spending. [ID:nN13186018]
 ""If we get strong U.S. retail sales numbers it could be
dollar positive because of the U.S. yield reaction. The dollar
would then gain against the yen and the Swiss franc,"" said
Adrian Schmidt, currency analyst at Lloyds Banking Group.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, dipped to 74.376, off a
two-week high of 74.960 struck the previous day.
 It was close to flat for the day at 80.14 yen .
 The Swiss franc , an outperformer in recent sessions,
fell broadly as better risk appetite led investors to book
profits in the safe-haven currency.
 The euro was up 0.35 percent on the Swiss franc  at
1.2108 francs with Barclays saying in a note that the pair was
edging towards oversold levels on the weekly RSI charts. 
 Meanwhile, the high-yielding Aussie  was up 0.4
percent at $1.0650, boosted by the better tone for risk and as
traders reported strong demand in the $1.0620/30 area.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Evidence that China may avoid a
hard landing for its high-flying economy lifted riskier assets
such as stocks on Tuesday and Greece managed to raise short-term
funds despite becoming S&P's lowest-rated sovereign borrower.
 Wall Street looked set to open stronger.
 Greece sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.33 billion) of 6-month
T-bills a day after Standard & Poor's rated its debt extremely
speculative.[ID:nN13126859]
 It had to pay a higher yield -- 4.96 percent versus May's
4.88 percent -- but attracted a larger percentage of foreign
buyers than the previous auction, reflecting market
expectations Greece will secure a second rescue package to stave
off default, at least over coming months.
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default over five
years rose, as did the yield on Greek government bonds, to a
record high.
 But Greek stocks reversed losses to put in modest gains and
European shares were otherwise buoyant.
 Euro zone finance ministers were to meet in Brussels where
the crisis and a disagreement between the European Central Bank
and a clutch of euro zone states led by Germany over whether
Greece should restructure will take centre stage.
 Financial markets were focused on data from China which was
interpreted as negating the need for aggressive tightening by
policymakers.
 China's inflation accelerated in May to a 34-month high of
5.5 percent, while retail sales came in marginally higher than
forecast and industrial output was slightly lower.
[ID:nL3E7HE05P]
 Although a little above expectations, the inflation data
suggested Chinese price rises were not out of control and that
growth was being managed.
 After the data, China's central bank increased the ratio of
reserves it requires its commercial lenders to hold by another
50 basis points, its sixth increase this year, extending its
campaign to tame inflation.
 ""A measured slowdown in the Chinese economy is just what
investors want, with today's figures providing some hope that
this is just what is unfolding,"" said Keith Bowman, equity
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
more than half a percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> gained 0.6 percent.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed barely changed from
the previous day.
 
 BUOYANT EURO
 Greece's trials did little to discourage investors from
buying the euro, which rose around 0.1 percent against the
dollar to $1.4433 .
 Despite the debt crisis, the single currency has climbed 8
percent against the dollar this year, nearly 7 percent against
the yen  and 2.5 percent against the pound .
 This is primarily due to differing expectations for interest
rate rises. The ECB is expected to tighten policy for the second
time this year in July while the U.S. economy is struggling,
pointing to a continued period of ultra-low interest rates
there.
 ""Clearly the markets are very concerned about the U.S.
economy and the U.S. debt situation,"" said Greg Gibbs,
strategist at RBS. ""Those are the key factors preventing what
would normally be a bigger (euro) fallout, given the amount of
risk around the European situation.""
 Yields on core euro zone debt rose slightly with 10-year
German Bunds  offering 2.98 percent. Greece's
10-year bond yield climbed 60 basis points to 17.7 percent
.

 By Ian Chua and Eric Burroughs	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro edged up across
the board on Tuesday after a batch of Chinese economic data
calmed some investor worries by showing inflation was not as bad
as feared and growth still solid, giving a broad boost to risky
assets.	
 The Australian dollar also gained after the Chinese reports
showed industrial production and retail sales posting solid
growth. Consumer prices accelerated to a 5.5 percent annual rate
in May, slightly higher than the Reuters consensus forecast and
the fastest in nearly three years. 
 Heading into the data releases, market players had fretted
that a quicker rise in Chinese inflation would prompt the
People's Bank of China to step up its aggressive tightening
campaign, adding to the threats facing the slowing global
economy.	
 ""The market got caught short. The whisper number for CPI was
6 percent ... so we're seeing a round of short covering on the
back of that,"" said Sue Trinh, senior currency strategist at RBC
in Hong Kong.	
 The euro's intraday rebound took it back above $1.44 to
challenge near-term resistance in the $1.4430/50 zone. A clean
push through that resistance to the $1.4470/80 area would
brighten the single currency's outlook for now, traders said.	
 The market is now turning its attention to inflation figures
in other parts of the world, and most importantly the May data
on U.S. retail sales for signs on whether the sudden slowdown in
the economy is hampering household spending. 
 ""We've just had some very negative surprises,"" said a trader
at a U.S. bank in Hong Kong. ""Unless retail sales are worse than
expected, maybe we'll have a nice bounce for equities and
cross/yen.""	
 The euro was up slightly from late U.S. trade at $1.4442
, recovering from a session low of $1.43782 on EBS. The
single currency was up 0.2 percent at 1.2088 francs
and off a session low of 1.2012, coming close to the record low
and stop-loss orders seen near the 1.200 level.	
 The high-yielding Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent at
$1.0637 , while the Aussie climbed even more against the
yen . 
 Equities and commodities also took heart from the Chinese
data and rebounded thanks to some short-covering. The broad MSCI
index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
recovered from a three-month low to rise 1.1 percent, while gold
and crude oil  pushed higher.	
 
 SAFE-HAVEN SWISSIE	
 The safe-haven Swiss franc held near a record high against
the euro, benefiting from the ongoing European debt crisis and
being viewed as one of the few major currencies not suffering
from debt troubles or the currency debasement of quantitative
easing.	
 The euro managed to climb against the dollar on Monday even
as European policymakers try to sort out their differences,
especially German officials and the European Central Bank who
have clashed over the prospect of a ""voluntary"" rollover that
may avoid triggering a full debt restructuring.	
 Talks about a second bailout for Greece are getting closer
to conclusion as the European Commission pushes for a voluntary
debt swap, media reported, as euro zone finance ministers meet
later on Tuesday to finalise the details of a bailout.

 Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and
monetary affairs, told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview to
be published on Tuesday that a solution for the Greek sovereign
debt crisis was not as far off as some might think.

 On Monday, Standard & Poor's slashed Greece's rating to CCC,
making the highly indebted country its lowest-rated in the
world. 
 ""The clock is ticking on a solution for the Greek debt
crisis,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, dipped to 74.403, off a
two-week high of 74.960 struck the previous day.	
 ""Clearly the markets are very concerned about the U.S.
economy and the U.S. debt situation itself,"" said Greg Gibbs,
strategist at RBS. ""Those are the key factors preventing what
would normally be a bigger fallout, given the amount of risk
around the European situation.""	
 The dollar drifted up to 80.30 yen and back towards
Monday's high of 80.70, stabilising around 80.00/81.00 in the
past week.	
 After a two-day meeting, the Bank of Japan expanded a loan
scheme for growth industries as expected, and the move had
little impact on markets.

 By Robert Birsel	
 SINGAPORE, June 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks gained on
Tuesday after China's inflation figures provided some relief
that it would not get more aggressive on tightening, helping
pull the euro up from near a record low against the Swiss franc.	
 China's consumer prices rose 5.5 percent in May, a tad
faster than the 5.4 percent estimated by a Reuters poll of
economists, while retail sales came in marginally higher than
forecast and industrial output was slightly lower.

 Analysts say while the data suggests China's economy is
slowing, the slowdown is not as much as some feared, leaving the
authorities free to fight inflation.	
 Shares in Japan and China rose while Brent crude edged
higher after the data, although other global worries such as a
faltering U.S recovery and Europe's sovereign debt crisis
continue to weigh. 
 The safe-haven Swiss franc held near a record high against
the euro in Asia, benefiting from the ongoing European debt
crisis, while the dollar stayed under pressure as other
currencies like the Australian dollar squeezed higher.	
 ""The lift from this morning's data shows the market seems to
be taking comfort in inflation not increasing too much beyond
expectations for now,"" said Lee Wee-Liat, a managing director at
Samsung Securities in Hong Kong. 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 1.07 percent while Japan's Nikkei average
ended 1.05 percent higher.	
 
 The euro's intraday rebound took it back above $1.44 to
challenge near-term resistance in the $1.4430/50 zone. A clean
push through that resistance to the $.4470/80 area would
brighten the single currency's outlook for now, traders said.
    The market is now turning its attention to inflation figures
in other parts of the world, and most importantly the May data
on U.S. retail sales for signs on whether the sudden slowdown in
the economy is hampering household spending. 
 European stocks are expected to remain steady on Tuesday
following the Chinese data with a number of investors seeing
attractive valuations after a six-week retreat. 
 
 GREECE JITTERS GAIN MOMENTUM	
 Uncertainties over Greece's looming debt problem intensified
after S&P on Monday slashed Greece's credit rating to
lowest-rated in the world, saying the debt-laden country is
increasingly likely to restructure its debt in a way the agency
would consider a default. For more, see 
 European leaders are due to finalise a new rescue package
worth about 120 billion euros for Greece at a Brussels summit on
June 23-24, but deep divisions remain about how to get the
private sector involved. Concern is growing that Greece will
eventually have to restructure its 340-billion-euro debt load. 
""If a compromise cannot be reached between these positions,
there is a chance that the second rescue effort disintegrates,
leaving Greece at the mercy of the bond markets,"" said Karl
Schamotta, market strategist at Western Union Business
Solutions, in Victoria, British Columbia. 
""One suspects that policymakers will avoid such a dire
outcome, but the uncertainty is weighing on investment
decisions,"" he said. 
 In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei ended at 9,547.79 and the
broader Topix edged up 1.37 percent to 822.86 at the
close.	
 Shares of electric power companies jumped after the cabinet
approved a scheme to help Tokyo Electric Power
compensate people affected by the crisis at its crippled
Fukushima nuclear plant. 
 TEPCO rose as much as 25 percent.	
 
 OIL, GOLD UP	
 Gold rebounded after a 1 percent drop in
the previous session on economic worries, but a weaker dollar
could offer support.	
 It rose to $1,520.85 after falling on Monday to its weakest
since late May. Gold, which hit a record around $1,575 in early
May, has been buoyed by uncertainties about the outlook for the
U.S. economy and worries about euro zone debt.	
 Oil recovered on Tuesday after China said industrial
production grew faster than expected in May, easing concerns
over a global economic slowdown and soothing worries that
Europe's debt crisis would dent energy demand. 
 Brent crude for July  climbed 24 cents to $119.34 a
barrel by 0609 GMT, widening its premium to U.S. crude benchmark
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to a record of more than $22 a
barrel. July WTI  edged 0.16 cents higher to $97.46.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Worries over a Greek default
pressured the euro against the Swiss franc on Monday, while a
rating agency's downgrade of Greece compounded fears of more
economic turmoil and reduced energy demand, pushing U.S. oil
prices lower.
 The single currency fell to a record low against the
safe-haven Swiss franc as the cost of insuring Greek sovereign
debt against default soared to an all-time high.
 Despite jitters over Greece, U.S. stocks finished flat,
recovering from a mild sell-off tied to Standard & Poor's
downgrade of Greece to close to default status.
 A steadier Wall Street kept gold near its session lows and
put downward pressure on low-risk government bonds.
 European leaders are due to finalize a new rescue package
worth about 120 billion euros for Greece at a Brussels summit
on June 23-24, but deep divisions remain about how to get the
private sector involved. Concerns are growing that Greece will
eventually have to restructure its 340-billion-euro debt load.
 ""If a compromise cannot be reached between these positions,
there is a chance that the second rescue effort disintegrates,
leaving Greece at the mercy of the bond markets,"" said Karl
Schamotta, market strategist at Western Union Business
Solutions, in Victoria, British Columbia.
 ""One suspects that policymakers will avoid such a dire
outcome, but the uncertainty is weighing on investment
decisions,"" he said.
 This uncertainty intensified on Monday after S&P slashed
Greece's credit rating to lowest-rated in the world, saying the
debt-laden country is increasingly likely to restructure its
debt in a way the agency would consider a default. For more,
see [ID:nN13126859]
 The euro fell against the Swiss franc on worries over the
cost of a Greece bailout. But it gained versus the U.S. dollar
on expectations that euro zone interest rates would remain
higher than those in the United States.
 The euro touched a record low 1.2004 Swiss francs on the
EBS trading platform . The Swiss franc is seen as a
global barometer for risk aversion.
 Against the dollar, the euro  was up around 0.2
percent at $1.44 after central bank buying erased early
losses.
 FALLING OIL
 Talk of a Greek default stoked bets of less oil demand on
fears of another global slowdown induced by Europe's fiscal
woes. The latest signs of a slowing Chinese economy also
heightened worries of slowing demand for commodities.
 U.S. crude oil  fell 2 percent to $97.30 a barrel. In
back-to-back sessions, it has lost 3.8 percent.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> fell 1
percent, posting its biggest two-day drop in a month.
 U.S. oil also fell on a report of more supply from Saudi
Arabia. The world's biggest oil exporter will raise output to
10 million barrels per day in July, Saudi newspaper al-Hayat
reported on Friday, as Riyadh goes it alone in pumping more
outside official OPEC policy.
 However, Brent oil in London traded higher, with its
premium over its U.S. counterpart hitting a record high of more
than $21 a barrel. For more, see [ID:nL3E7HD0FM]
 LOOKING FOR CHEAP STOCKS
 The S&P downgrade of Greece was a reminder of that
country's grim fiscal situation. But it was not a game-changer
that discouraged investors looking to purchase cheap stocks
after they had fallen for six straight weeks.
 ""It's bringing in a bit of buying. People are just
nibbling,"" said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at
Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, which has $340 billion
in assets under management.
 Weaker Chinese data fueled concerns about slowing global
growth and knocked non-U.S. shares to a 12-week low, according
to the MSCl Global Equity Index <.MIWD00000PUS>. But the index
ended up 0.02 percent on the day in chopping trading.
 In U.S. trading, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
ended up 1.06 points, or 0.01 percent, at 11,952.97. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 0.85 points, or 0.07
percent, at 1,271.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 4.04 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,639.69.
 Top European stocks <.FTEU3> ended up 0.2 percent, but
Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> closed down 0.7 percent.
 Nikkei futures in Chicago <2NKc1> ended at 9,435, compared
with the Osaka close  of 9,460.
 Bullion prices fell 1 percent on the day after the S&P move
on Greece reduced the euro's gain against the dollar. Spot gold
 touched a session low of 1,511.11 an ounce.
 In government debt trading, benchmark U.S. 10-year yields
 hovered near a six-month low just under 3 percent,
while September German Bund futures  ended flat after
hitting a contract high of 126.11.
 Five-year credit default swaps on Greek sovereign debt rose
to a record high of 1,613.33 basis points at the close, prior
to the S&P downgrade, according to data monitor Markit.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc on Monday, with more losses likely as
disagreement among policymakers over how to solve Greece's debt
crisis unsettled investors and boosted the safe-haven allure of
the franc.
 But the euro managed to gain versus the U.S. dollar, helped
by central bank demand and after U.S. stock prices came off
early lows. Concerns about a stalling U.S. economic recovery
and a ballooning budget deficit also weighed on the dollar.
 The single currency dropped as low as 1.2004 Swiss francs
 on trading platform EBS. Traders expect the pair
to fall below the 1.20 level, where large option structures
were noted, with a break below likely triggering more euro
selling.
 European leaders are due to finalize a new rescue package
for Greece at a Brussels summit on June 23-24. But deep
divisions remain about how to get the private sector involved.
Concerns are growing that Greece will eventually have to
restructure its debt.
 ""If a compromise cannot be reached between these positions,
there is a chance that the second rescue effort disintegrates,
leaving Greece at the mercy of the bond markets,"" said Karl
Schamotta, market strategist at Western Union Business
Solutions, in Victoria, British Columbia.
 ""One suspects that policymakers will avoid such a dire
outcome, but the uncertainty is weighing on investment
decisions.""
 The euro last traded at 1.2068 francs, down 0.2 percent on
the day. Earlier, it fell to a session low near 1.20 francs in
thin liquidity after a break below 1.2050 triggered stop-loss
orders and system-related selling.
 ""The Swiss franc is the currency to be in right now,"" said
Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting
in Washington. ""The trend as investors need European exposure
is to buy Swiss francs as opposed to the Scandies.""
 Price swings may have been exacerbated by low volume with
many centers in Europe closed for a holiday.
 Adding to the negative sentiment, Standard & Poor's cut
Greece's long-term ratings by three notches to junk territory.
The ratings agency said in a statement that a restructuring of
Greece's debt -- either with a bond swap or by extending
maturities on existing bonds -- looks increasingly likely. For
details, see [ID:nN13126859]
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.4413 , near a session
high of $1.4430 and rising above resistance at the 55-day
simple moving average at $1.4398.
 Resistance is seen at a concentration of former support
levels around $1.4430/50, which includes previous intraday
peaks in May and a 38.2 percent retracement of the May-to-June
rise.
 Investors also see a reduced likelihood of euro-zone rate
hikes in the months ahead. Last week, the European Central Bank
left inflation forecasts for 2012 unchanged, suggesting the
pace of future interest-rate hikes may be slower than
previously thought.
 The rush toward safe-haven assets boosted the Swiss franc
and kept the dollar pinned near record lows hit last week. The
dollar was last down 0.7 percent at 0.8372 franc .
 The Swiss National Bank meets this week for a rate decision
and is unlikely to signal any risk of intervention to cap the
franc's strength.
 The New Zealand dollar tumbled after a series of powerful
earthquakes shook Christchurch, four months after the city was
badly damaged by a 6.3 magnitude quake. The kiwi dropped 0.6
percent to trade at $0.8158 .

 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on
Monday, overcoming a mild sell-off tied to a rating agency's
downgrade of Greece, but fears over a possible Greek default
pushed the euro to an all-time low against the Swiss franc.

notches on Monday to CCC, saying the debt-laden country is

to the MSCl Global Equity Index <.MIWD00000PUS>. The index
stabilized briefly on modest early gains in U.S. and European
stocks <.FTEU3>, then subsequently slipped back into negative
territory after S&P's rating move on Greece.
 Anxiety over a Greek default reduced risk appetite, fueling
an unwinding of positions in oil and precious metals. On the
other hand, it stoked safe-haven demand for low-risk government
debt, pushing German Bund futures to contract highs.
 ""The longer Greece takes to resolve its problem, the more
the market is going to assume the worst,"" said Chuck Retzky,
director of futures sales at Mizuho Securitis USA in Chicago.

 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks rose
modestly on Monday after six-weeks of losses enticed
bargain-hunting investors back into the market, while the euro
fell on nagging worries over Europe's attempts to solve the
Greek debt crisis.
 Weaker Chinese data fueled concerns about slowing global
growth, briefly knocking non-U.S. shares to a 12-week low,
according to the MSCl Global Equity Index <.MIWD00000PUS>.
Gains in U.S. and European stocks <.FTEU3> subsequently helped
stabilize it.
 Reduced risk appetite led to an unwinding of positions in
oil and precious metals.
 ""The market has been oversold over the last six weeks, so a
short-term rebound on short-covering is not out of the
question,"" said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel,
Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey.
 In U.S. trading, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
was up 19.72 points, or 0.16 percent, at 11,971.63. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 2.26 points, or 0.18
percent, at 1,273.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up
0.52 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,644.25.
 The S&P 500 has lost nearly 7 percent on a barrage of
disappointing economic data after closing on April 29 at its
highest closing level in nearly three years.
 FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.3 percent as investors
nabbed battered European shares. But the index is still down
2.5 percent so far this year. [US/]
 However, Monday's gains failed to inspire confidence of a
turnaround in global stocks.
 The world stock benchmark, the MSCI, has lost nearly 8
percent since hitting a three-year peak in late April and is
very close to erasing all of its 2011 gains.
 ""Despite the fact you have a slight rebound after several
weeks of decline, U.S. and global equities will stay under
pressure,"" said Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at TCW
in Los Angeles, which oversees $121 billion in assets.
 In Asia, Chinese stocks ended at a 4-1/2 month low, hit by
worries about the impact of monetary policy tightening in an
economy which is a key driver of world growth.
 China's money growth slowed to a 30-month low in May and
banks extended fewer new loans than expected, while exports to
the United States and EU hit their weakest since late 2009. For

 GREEK DEAL WEIGHS
 An increasingly gloomy economic outlook and Greece's fiscal
predicament have stacked the odds against risk-taking.
 Investors are concerned by signs policymakers are
struggling to reach an agreement on a second bailout for Athens
and that any moves to involve private investors will wind up
triggering a technical debt default.
 The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt against default
rose to an all-time high, while the euro hit a record low
against the safe-haven Swiss franc.
 Uncertainty over future U.S. monetary policy after the
Federal Reserve's $600-billion bond purchase program ends this
month also added to investor aversion to taking on riskier
assets, especially going into the thinly traded summer months.
 European leaders are due to complete a new rescue package
for Greece at a Brussels summit on June 23-24, but deep
divisions remain about how to get the private sector involved.
 Five-year credit default swaps on Greek sovereign debt rose
58 basis points on the day to a record high of 1,600 bps,
according to data monitor Markit.
 ""What the euro needs is a resolution to the Greek crisis
and the politicians and the central bankers do not appear to be
close to finding one,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at
Societe Generale in London. ""That uncertainty is weighing on
the euro.""
 The euro fell against the Swiss franc, but gained versus
the U.S. dollar on expectations that euro zone interest rates
would remain higher than those in the United States.
 The euro touched a record low of 1.2004 Swiss francs on the
EBS trading platform . The Swiss franc is seen as a
global barometer for risk aversion.
 The euro  was up around 0.2 percent at $1.4368 after
central bank buying erased earlier losses.
 In the oil market, U.S. crude oil  fell 0.6 percent
to $98.67 a barrel on a report of more supply from Saudi
Arabia. The world's biggest oil exporter will raise output to
10 million barrels per day in July, Saudi newspaper al-Hayat
reported on Friday, as Riyadh goes it alone in pumping more
outside official OPEC policy.
 Bullion prices fell to the lowest in about 10 days as the
euro eased against the dollar. Spot gold  was down 0.3
percent at $1,525.40 an ounce, above a session low of
$1,523.44.
 In government debt trading, benchmark U.S. 10-year yields
 lingered near a six-month low of 3 percent, while
September German Bund futures  hit contract highs.

 * U.S. oil prices fall, gold near 10-day lows
(Updates to U.S. markets;, changes dateline, previous LONDON)
 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rose on
Monday after cheaper prices after six-weeks of losses enticed
bargain-hunting investors back into the market, even as the
euro fell on nagging worries over Europe's attempts to solve
the Greek debt crisis.
 Weaker Chinese data fueled concerns about slowing global
growth, briefly knocking non-U.S. shares to a 12-week low.
 Reduced risk appetite led to an unwinding of positions in
oil and precious metals.
 ""The market has been oversold over the last six weeks, so a
short-term rebound on short-covering is not out of the
question,"" said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel,
Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey.
 The S&P 500 index <.SPX> and other benchmarks opened higher
on Monday. The S&P 500 sagged nearly 7 percent on the back of a
barrage of soft economic data after closing on April 29 at its
highest closing level in nearly three years. [US/]
 The gains in U.S. and European stocks <.FTEU3> helped the
MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> to rise 0.2 percent
after hitting its weakest since mid-March.
 The world stock benchmark has lost nearly 8 percent since
hitting a three-year peak in late April and is very close to
erasing all of its 2011 gains.
 In Asia, Chinese stocks ended at a 4-1/2 month low, hit by
worries about the impact of monetary policy tightening in an
economy which is a key driver of world growth.
 China's money growth slowed to a 30-month low in May and
banks extended fewer new loans than expected, while exports to
the United States and EU hit their weakest since late 2009.
 An increasingly gloomy economic backdrop and Greece's
fiscal predicament have stacked the odds against risk-taking.
 Investors are concerned by signs policymakers are
struggling to reach an agreement on a second bailout for Athens
and that any steps taken to involve private investors will wind
up triggering a technical debt default.
 The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt against default
rose to an all-time high, while the euro hit a record low
against the safe-haven Swiss franc.
 Uncertainty over future U.S. monetary policy after the
Federal Reserve's $600-billion bond purchase program ends this
month also added to investor aversion to taking on riskier
assets, especially going into the thinly-traded summer months.
 ""Equities look like a buy at these sorts of levels on a one
to two year view, but I would not read too much into it,"" said
David Coombs, fund manager at Rathbone Brothers, which has 15.2
billion pounds under management.
 GREEK DEAL
 European leaders are due to complete a new rescue package
for Greece at a Brussels summit on June 23-24, but deep
divisions remain about how to get the private sector involved,
while the deal would not help reduce Greece's massive 340
billion euro debt load.
 Five-year credit default swaps on Greek sovereign debt rose
58 basis points on the day to a record high of 1,600 bps,
according to data monitor Markit.
 ""What the euro needs is a resolution to the Greek crisis
and the politicians and the central bankers do not appear to be
close to finding one,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at
Societe Generale in London. ""That uncertainty is weighing on
the euro.""
 The euro fell against the Swiss franc, but gained versus
the U.S. dollar on expectations that euro zone interest rates
would remain higher than those in the United States.
 The euro touched a record low of 1.2004 Swiss francs on the
EBS trading platform . The Swiss franc is seen as a
global barometer for risk aversion.
 The euro  was up around 0.2 percent at $1.4375 after
central bank buying erased earlier losses.
 In the oil market, U.S. crude oil  fell 0.76 percent
to $98.53 a barrel on a report of more supply from Saudi
Arabia. The world's biggest oil exporter will raise output to
10 million barrels per day in July, Saudi newspaper al-Hayat
reported on Friday, as Riyadh goes it alone in pumping more
outside official OPEC policy.
 In gold trading, bullion prices fell to its lowest in about
10 days as the euro eased against the dollar. Spot gold 
was down 0.3 percent at $1,527.11 an ounce, above a session low
of $1,523.44.

LONDON)
 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - The euro hit a record low
against the Swiss franc on Monday as worries over policymakers'
attempts to handle the Greek debt crisis prompted investors to
seek relative safety in the franc.
 Price swings may have been exacerbated by low volume with
many centers in Europe closed for a holiday. The cost of
insuring peripheral euro zone bonds against default hit a
record high, while a general lack of appetite towards riskier
assets dented euro sentiment.
 The euro fell to as low as 1.2004 francs  on
trading platform EBS. Traders said stop-loss orders were
triggered after it fell through 1.2050, and system-related
selling pushed it towards 1.2000 francs in thin liquidity.
 ""There is great concern about what is going on in Europe
and the Swiss franc is the most attractive safe-haven currency
right now,"" said Jessica Hoverson, a fixed income and currency
analyst at MF Global in Chicago
 Traders highlighted large option structures at 1.2000, with
a break below that expected to trigger more euro selling.
Euro/Swiss last traded around 1.2032, down around 0.5 percent
for the day.
 The euro  also slumped against the dollar before some
central bank demand helped it erase losses and gain on the day.
It was last trading up 0.2 percent at $1.4375.
 Resistance was at the 55-day simple moving average at
$1.4398 and a concentration of former support levels around
$1.4430/50, which includes previous intraday peaks in May and a
38.2 percent retracement of the May-to-June rise.
 ""What the euro needs is a resolution to the Greek crisis
and the politicians and the central bankers do not appear to be
close to finding one,"""" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at
Societe Generale in London. ""That uncertainty is weighing on
the euro and I expect it to be stuck in a $1.40-$1.47 range.""
 European policymakers appeared deadlocked on how to involve
private investors in some form of restructuring of Greek debt.
The European Central Bank is opposed to German proposals for a
bond swap, arguing that it would trigger market turmoil.
 Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann in comments released at the
weekend said he was against extending the maturities of Greek
bonds held by the ECB in any ""soft"" restructuring.
 German and French banks were leaning towards contributing
to a Greek rescue, even as it remained unclear how they could
do so without triggering a default or credit default swap
contracts. For more see [ID:nLDE75A065].
 Investors also see a reduced likelihood of repeated euro
zone rate hikes in the months ahead. Even as ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet signaled a rate hike is on the way in July,
the ECB left inflation forecasts for 2012 little changed,
prompting traders to slash expectations for higher policy
rates.
 SAFE-HAVEN FLOWS
 The rush towards safe-haven assets boosted the Swiss franc
and kept the dollar pinned near record lows hit last week. The
dollar was last down 0.7 percent at 0.8370 .
 ""The Swiss franc remains the global barometer for risk and
the fresh euro zone jitters have given renewed confidence to
investors to push it higher,"" said Lena Komileva, head of G-10
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London.
 The Swiss National Bank meets this week for a rate
decision, and is unlikely to signal any risk of intervention to
cap the franc's strength.
 The New Zealand dollar tumbled after a series of powerful
earthquakes shook Christchurch, four months after the city was
badly damaged by a 6.3 magnitude quake. The kiwi dropped 0.9
percent to trade at $0.8132 .

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - The euro eased against the
dollar and fell towards record lows versus the Swiss franc on
Monday, as bickering between euro zone policymakers over the
Greek debt crisis led investors to cut exposure.
 Volumes were on the lower side with many centres in Europe
closed for a holiday. Expectations that peripheral bond spreads
will continue to widen over their German counterparts and a
general lack of appetite towards riskier assets also weighed.
 The euro  was down 0.1 percent at $1.4336, as a bout
of short covering seen in Asia ran out of steam. Traders cited
option expiries at $1.43 which could check losses.
 It is also likely to struggle to past $1.44, traders said.
Among the resistance levels are the 55-day moving average at
$1.4398 and a concentration of former chart support around
$1.4430/50, which includes previous intraday peaks in May and a
38.2 percent retracement of the May-to-June rise.
 ""What the euro needs is a resolution to the Greek crisis and
the politicians and the central bankers do not appear to be
close to finding one,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at
Societe Generale. ""That uncertainty is weighing on the euro and
I expect it to be stuck in a $1.40-$1.47 range.""
 Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, the euro was flat at
1.2100 francs , having fallen to a record low 1.2049
earlier in the day.
 European policymakers appeared deadlocked on how private
investors could be involved in some form of restructuring of
Greek debt. The European Central Bank is opposed to German
proposals for a bond swap, arguing that it would trigger market
turmoil. And Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann in comments released
at the weekend said he was against extending the maturities of
Greek bonds held by the ECB in any ""soft"" restructuring.
 German and French banks were leaning towards contributing to
a Greek rescue, even as it remained unclear how they could do so
without triggering a default or credit default swap contracts.
[ID:nLDE75A065]
 Investors also see less risk of repeated euro zone rate
hikes in the months ahead. Even as ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet signalled a rate hike is on the way in July, the ECB
left inflation forecasts for 2012 little changed, prompting
traders to slash expectations for higher policy rates.
 As such, the euro's uncertain outlook saw implied
volatilities rise with risk reversals also widening, suggesting
more downside risks for the single currency.
 One-month  implied vols were trading around 12.15
percent, up from 11.05 at Friday's European open. The one-month
25-delta risk reversals  were at around 2.00 in
favour of euro puts compared to 1.75 Friday.
 
 RISKS RISE
 The euro's woes have been compounded by a drop in global
stocks that has prompted some market players to unwind carry
trades funded with the U.S. dollar.
 Forex analysts at Citigroup warned that investors appear
overly optimistic that central banks would provide more support
if stocks and other risky assets fell sharply.
 The Federal Reserve will have a high hurdle for more
quantitative easing, fiscal policy is set to tighten in the
United States, and emerging market central banks are lifting
rates just as many commodity and stock markets are already
richly valued, Citi said.
 ""This time the assumed policy response may be much more
limited than in the last two years, and probably less
effective,"" said Steven Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at
Citi.
 The dollar was flat at 80.37 yen , having clawed back
up from a one-month low of 79.693 struck last week on buying by
Japanese importers. The dollar index <.DXY> was also flat at
74.794.
 The New Zealand dollar tumbled after a series of powerful
earthquakes shook Christchurch, four months after the city was
badly damaged by a 6.3 magnitude quake. [ID:nL3E7HD04S]
 The kiwi dropped 1 percent and hit a low of $0.8117 
and was last at $0.8145. The Aussie was up slightly at $1.0539
, receiving a boost from short-covering by players
including macro hedge funds, traders said.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, June 13 (Reuters) - The euro strengthened on
Monday, though its gains appeared short-lived as major European
powers continue to haggle over a fresh rescue package for
Greece, while Asian stocks extended a seven-week losing streak
on fears the global recovery is losing steam.	
 European shares were set to open broadly stable after
Friday's selloff, according to financial spreadbetters.

 Concerns over a sputtering U.S. economic recovery, slowing
growth in China and India and festering problems in the euro
zone pushed the MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
down by nearly 1 percent to a 2-1/2 month low
before regaining some ground to be 0.6 percent lower. 
 With the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond purchase
program set to expire by the end of June, investors have sought
refuge in safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasuries even as
politicians in Washington wrangle over extending its debt
ceiling and the world's biggest economy lurches towards a
technical default.	
 That kept the dollar near a one-week high against a basket
of currencies and supported around 80 versus the yen
, a day before a Bank of Japan meeting where it will
consider expanding a loan program aimed at supporting certain
industries, according to sources. 
 The euro edged higher after falling by nearly 2 percent last
week, its worst weekly performance since mid-May. But its gains
are expected to be limited by disputes among policymakers ahead
of a meeting next week at which euro zone leaders are due to
finalise a new rescue package for Greece. 
 It was up slightly at $1.4344 after dropping as far
as $1.4285 on EBS in very early Asia trade and down from a
one-month peak of $1.46966. Traders cited broad short-covering
kicking in after players failed to chase the euro's early drop.	
 Ironically, the single currency's latest bout of weakness
came after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet last week signaled
a July rate hike, an indication that market players are
expecting fewer rate increases after that. 
 ""The euro had been bought on hopes for rate hikes, but it
seems like after the one that was signalled last week takes
place in July, the next ones may not follow suit that quickly,""
said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ. 
 
BEYOND QE2	
As the Fed's bond purchase plan winds down to a close with
its last purchase of $50 billion of Treasuries this week,
investors expect stocks, bonds, gold and the euro to weaken
subsequently, according to a Reuters poll of 64 analysts and
fund managers last month. 
The end of ""Quantitative Easing 2"", or ""QE2"" as it is more
popularly known, could reduce the flood of money that has
travelled to Asia in recent months searching for higher yields
and forcing the region's central banks to tighten monetary
policy. 
 Data from fund tracker EPFR Global showed emerging market
bond funds received new weekly money totaling $1.4 billion up to
June 8, an eight-month high. Hard currency bond funds attracted
$726 million, the highest in over three years.	
 Anticipating a slowdown in incremental flows, credit spreads
widened slightly on Monday and Asian stocks traded on a weaker
note though volume is expected to be subdued with holidays in
Australia and before a slew of U.S. economic data this week.	
 The end of the final series of government bond purchases
that marks the last phase of the U.S. plan launched in November
2010 does not mean the stimulus will come to a complete stop. 
 The Fed will reinvest maturing securities, mainly
mortgage-related debt, which analysts predict will run at $12
billion to $16 billion per month. 
 Shares in Tokyo fell 0.7 percent, hurt by weak
machinery data for April in a sign that reconstruction-related
demand after Japan's massive March 11 earthquake has been slow
to materialise. 
 Among the principal laggards on Monday were Chinese shares
, which fell nearly a percent on concerns over the
restructuring of local government debt and fears of further
policy tightening to curb inflation.	
 The weakness in stocks helped bonds with yields on U.S.
10-year notes holding below 3 percent.	
 U.S. crude's front month futures was steady slightly below
$99 a barrel  and Brent was near $118.50 per barrel
. 
 Spot gold steadied around $1,530 per ounce after
slipping almost 1 percent in the previous session while silver
was around the $36 line.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Major stock markets fell for
a fifth week in six on Friday on growing worries about the
global economy, while U.S. crude oil prices sank more than $2
on Saudi Arabia's offer of more oil to Asian refiners.
 The euro declined the most against the dollar in a month as
concern over Greece's debt crisis returned to center stage and
investors scaled back expectations on the pace of future
interest-rate hikes in the euro zone.
 Fears the global economic recovery is stumbling grew after
data showed China's export growth slowed in May. That followed
a barrage of reports in recent weeks showing the U.S. economy
has hit a soft patch, which rattled investors. For more, see
[ID:nL3E7HA0B2]
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> lost 1.5 percent on the day, posting their
fifth down week in six. The index has lost 7 percent over the
past six weeks, erasing almost all of its gains so far this
year.
 ""We have had a slow erosion of economic numbers in the past
quarter,"" said Brian Battle, vice president of trading at
Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. ""The economic
numbers aren't supporting this level of valuation.""
 Wall Street fell sharply, with the Nasdaq ending in
negative territory for the year and the Dow industrials closing
below 12,000 for the first time since mid-March. The Dow and
S&P 500 also closed out their sixth week of losses.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 172.45
points, or 1.42 percent, at 11,951.91. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 18.02 points, or 1.40 percent, to
1,270.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 41.14 points,
or 1.53 percent, to 2,643.73.
 European shares fell to a three-month closing low and
posted their sixth week of losses. The FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> stock index dropped 1.4 percent to 1,089.55.
 U.S. crude oil  settled at $99.29 a barrel, down
$2.64, after earlier falling to a session low at $98.60. Brent
crude  settled 79 cents lower at $118.78 a barrel,
having risen to $120.07 earlier, the highest since May 5.
 Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is offering more oil to Asian
refiners in July, industry sources with direct knowledge of
negotiations said. It was the first evidence the kingdom is
taking steps to raise supplies unilaterally after OPEC failed
earlier this week to agree on an increase in the cartel's
production targets.
 GREEK DEBT
 The euro fell 1.2 percent to $1.4338 , on track
for its biggest daily drop since May 11. It was down 1.2
percent at 115.18 yen , hurt by the lack of unity
among euro-zone officials on a resolution of Greece's debt
troubles.
 Adding to bearish sentiment, the European Central Bank kept
its 2012 inflation forecast unchanged on Thursday after leaving
rates at 1.25 percent, suggesting the pace of euro-zone
interest-rate hikes may be slower than previously thought.
 Investors received mixed messages about the progress of
debt assistance to Greece. Germany stuck to its demand that
private investors contribute to a second bailout even after
renewed ECB opposition to any investor participation that might
be deemed involuntary. [ID:nLDE7590LU] [ID:nLDE7581Z8]
 ""The image of European policymakers and the ECB standing
toe to toe on this particular issue is something investors find
deeply unsettling,"" said Michael Derks, chief strategist at
FXPro.
 Five-year credit default swaps on Greek government debt
rose 25 basis points to 1,545 basis points, according to data
monitor Markit. That means it costs 1.545 million euros to
protect 10 million euros of exposure to Greek bonds.
 Spanish, Portuguese and Ireland CDS all traded higher,
while bonds issued by the euro zone's most debt-laden economies
came under pressure.
 Losses in global equities drove Treasury prices up as
investors flocked to lower-risk government debt. The benchmark
U.S. 10-year Treasury note  rose 7/32 in price to

 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Major stock indexes headed
for their fifth weekly loss in six weeks on Friday on growing
global economy worries, while U.S. crude oil prices sank more
than $2 on Saudi Arabia's offer of more oil to Asian refiners.
 The euro fell the most against the dollar in a month as
worries over Greece's debt crisis returned to center stage and
investors scaled back expectations on the pace of future
interest-rate hikes in the euro zone.
 Fears the global economic recovery is stumbling grew after
data showed China's export growth slowed in May. That followed
a barrage of reports in recent weeks showing the U.S. economy
has hit a soft patch, which rattled investors. For more, see

 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.3 percent, on track for the fifth down
week in six. The index has lost 7 percent over the past six
weeks, erasing almost all of its gains so far this year.
 ""We have had a slow erosion of economic numbers in the past
quarter,"" said Brian Battle, vice president of trading at
Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. ""The economic
numbers aren't supporting this level of valuation.""
 Wall Street fell sharply, with the Dow industrials and the
S&P 500 on track for a sixth straight week of losses. The
Nasdaq turned negative for the year for part of the session
before rebounding slightly in mid-afternoon trading.
 At 3:30 p.m EDT (1930 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was down 130.67 points, or 1.08 percent, at
11,993.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down

 European shares fell to a three-month closing low and

 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 0.5 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  settled at $99.29 a barrel, down
$2.64, after falling to a session low at $98.60 earlier. Brent
crude  was down 87 cents at $118.70 a barrel, having
risen to $120.07 earlier, the highest since May 5.
 Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is offering more oil to Asian

production targets.
 GREEK DEBT
 The euro fell 1.2 percent to $1.4332 , on track
for its biggest daily drop since May 11. It was down 1.3
percent at 115.01 yen , hurt by the lack of unity
among euro-zone officials on a resolution of Greece's debt
troubles.
 Adding to bearish sentiment, the European Central Bank kept
its 2012 inflation forecast unchanged on Thursday after leaving
rates at 1.25 percent, suggesting the pace of euro-zone
interest-rate hikes may be slower than previously thought.

 Five-year credit default swaps on Greek government debt
rose 25 basis points to 1,545 basis points, according to data

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell for a third
straight day against the dollar on Friday, with more losses
viewed as likely, weighed down by wranglings about how to
handle Greece's debt crisis and diminished expectations about
euro zone rate hikes.
 The euro was on track for its worst daily performance in a
month and was down 1.9 percent for the week.
 A broad-based flight to safety stemming from worries about
the global economic recovery also dragged down the euro and
other currencies that typically rise in times of increased risk
appetite.
 Greece also heightened the markets' aversion to risk as
investors received mixed messages about the progress of
financial assistance to the debt-ridden country.
 Germany stuck to its demand that private investors
contribute to a second bailout, even as the European Central
Bank was opposed to any form of debt restructuring.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet again indicated on
Thursday the bank would not roll over its own Greek bond
holdings. He also suggested that the ECB might not be willing
to accept Greek bonds as collateral from banks seeking loans if
some form of restructuring made the bonds ineligible under ECB
rules. For those stories, click on [ID:nLDE7590LU],
[ID:nLDE758146], [ID:nLDE7580DV].
 ""The market has seen a broad sell-off in risk, and I have
to blame Trichet, who on Thursday pretty much assured Greek
debt restructuring fails by stating the ECB would not take part
in a rollover of Greek debt so long as that event was a credit
event or event of default,"" said David Gilmore, a partner at FX
Analytics, in Essex, Connecticut.
 In early afternoon trading, the euro fell as low as
$1.43220 on trading platform EBS  and was last at
$1.43437, down 1.1 percent on the day.
 Against the yen, the euro fell as low as 114.940, its
weakest level since May 27. It last traded at 115.200
, down about 1.2 percent on the day.
""Until some clarity about Greece emerges, the euro will
probably continue to suffer,"" said Mark McCormick, currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Greece's bond yields rose by 60 basis points, with the
short end of the curve leading the sell-off. Reuters
calculations from Markit show 5-year credit default swaps
reflect a 74 percent default probability based on a 41 percent
recovery rate. See [GVD/EUR]
 The uncertainty should continue next week, analysts said,
with a high risk that consensus is not reached before a June 20
euro-zone finance ministers' meeting, which will discuss ways
to secure more funding for Greece. That was a pre-condition for
a vital disbursement of the next tranche of its current bailout
in July.
 ""Seems like a slow motion Lehman event is again unfolding
in the euro zone, and policy response is not going to get in
front of the problem ... Helmets are mandatory next week
despite the hot weather,"" said FX Analytics' Gilmore.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Apart from the Greek drama, reduced rate expectations also
hurt the euro.
 The ECB on Thursday kept its 2012 inflation forecast
unchanged, suggesting the pace of euro-zone interest-rate hikes
may be slower than previously thought.
 Trichet cemented the market's view that the ECB will raise
rates in July, but another hike is not priced into the market
until early 2012.

 Core euro zone debt was generally a bit stronger, but there
was more pressure on the periphery as the premium investors
demand to hold Spanish and other lower-rated government bonds
rather than benchmark German Bunds rose.
 Five-year credit default swaps on Greek government debt
rose 25 basis points to 1,545 basis points, according to data
monitor Markit. That means it costs 1.545 million euros to
protect 10 million euros of exposure to Greek bonds.
 Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes  were
trading 10/32 higher in price to yield 2.96 percent, down from
3.00 percent late on Thursday.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - World stocks headed for their
fifth weekly loss out of the past six on Friday, depressed by
concerns about a slowing global economy and by Europe's ongoing
struggle to control Greek debt.
 Wall Street also looked set to open lower.
 The euro slipped against the dollar despite the European
Central Bank's all-but-official confirmation that it will raise
interest rates in July.
 Brent oil hit a five week high and U.S. crude reached over
$102 a barrel but both later slipped back after Saudi Arabia
began offering more oil to Asian refiners, easing worries about
supplies following an inconclusive OPEC meeting. 
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
down a quarter of a percent, losing more than 6 percent over
six weeks and gaining only 1.5 percent for the year to date.
 Some worries about the state of the world economy were
assuaged on Thursday by better-than-expected U.S. trade deficit
data, which may imply stronger second-quarter growth than
expected.
 But the euro zone debt troubles and a generally defensive
stance by many investors pulled stocks lower.
""Even though in our base scenario we still believe that this
is a temporary slowdown and that economic growth will pick up
later in the year, the markets will continue to be nervous and
volatile in the meantime,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of
research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.
 Stresses in the euro zone remained firmly in place, despite
moves by Greece to institute a new austerity plan and some
progress among euro zone leaders to agree a new bail out.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet appeared
to be at loggerheads with Germany over the role that private
investors might play in some kind of refinancing of Greek debt.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> stock index was down 0.4
percent. Earlier Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up half a
percent.
 
 EURO WEAKER
 The euro struggled to keep its footing as the worries about
debt problems overwhelmed any support from a likely interest
rate rise by the European Central Bank next month.
 ""The image of European policymakers and the ECB standing toe
to toe on this particular issue is something investors find
deeply unsettling,"" said Michael Derks, chief strategist at
FXPro.
 The euro was down a third of a percent at $1.4462 ,
although it got a brief boost when Germany's Bundestag voted in
favour of a motion to approve new aid for Greece.
 Core euro zone debt was generally a bit stronger, but there
was more pressure on the periphery.
 The premium investors demand to hold Spanish and other
lower-rated government bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds
rose.
 Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) on Greek government
debt rose 25 basis points to 1,545 basis points, according to
data monitor Markit. This means it costs 1.545 million euros to
protect 10 million euros of exposure to Greek bonds.
 Spanish CDS were 9 basis points up at 269 basis points,
while Portuguese CDS were 12 basis points higher at 725 basis
points. Ireland's were 8 basis points higher at 695 basis
points.

 By Nia Williams
 LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday as
worries about the Greek zone debt crisis and a weakening global
growth outlook eclipsed any support from a likely euro zone
interest rate rise next month.
 European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet
signalled on Thursday the benchmark refinancing rate, currently
at 1.25 percent,would rise next month. Markets had expected as
much and already priced in the prospect of a July hike.
 Investors shifted their focus back to Greece's debt woes,
putting selling pressure onto the single currency. It was last
down 0.3 percent on the day at $1.4460, struggling to regain its
footing after crashing from above $1.46 before Trichet spoke.
 Solid technical support is seen at $1.4419, a 38.2 percent
retracement of the May 23-June 7 rally.
 The ECB kept its 2012 inflation forecast unchanged,
suggesting the pace of euro zone interest rate hikes may be
slower than previously thought.
 ""The deteriorating growth outlook has taken precedence in
investors' minds, rather than there will a rate hike in July.
Euro zone rate expectations for Q1 2012 have now fallen quite
sharply against the U.S.,"" said Adam Myers, FX strategist at
Credit Agricole.
 ""The growth outlook has been moderated by everyone in the
market and we could be in a situation next year where the
Federal Reserve is still moving towards tightening while the ECB
is not doing anything.""
 Investors have scaled back their expectations of the pace of
ECB interest hikes. After July, another move is not priced in
until early next year. 
 Trichet also used the news conference to signal the ECB's
opposition to forcing private creditors to take part in debt
relief for Greece, in contrast to Germany, which has demanded a
bond swap to lengthen Greek debt maturities. [ID:nLDE7581Z8]
 A lack of unity among euro zone officials further rattled
the market, adding to concerns the crisis would drag on for some
time to come.
 ""The image of European policymakers and the ECB standing toe
to toe on this particular issue is something investors find
deeply unsettling,"" said Michael Derks, chief strategist at
FXPro.
 ""The ECB are saying we are not going to help anymore than we
have done through liquidity provisions and buying secondary
bonds. Essentially they are saying to European policymakers that
taxpayers have to foot the bill.""
 
 YEN STRENGTH
 The yen was up against the dollar and euro, benefitting from
a risk-off sentiment in the market, stemming from recent weaker
macroeconomic data from around the globe that also pushed
commodity currencies lower.
 The euro fell to a 115.73 yen , close to a low of
115.50 yen last seen on May 30 while the greenback fell 0.3
percent to 80.05 yen .
 Traders said order books were weighted towards dollar
sellers after the dollar reached a one-week high of 80.47 yen on
Thursday, with reports of options barriers to be defended at
79.50.
 Japanese importers and investors were expected to show
strong buying interest below 80 yen, traders said.
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.3 percent to a one-week high
of 74.404.
 Sterling dipped to a session low of $1.6215 against the
dollar  after UK industrial output data dropped more
than expected in April. [ID:LDE7590IX]. But the pound then
recouped losses to last trade at $1.6264, little changed from
pre-data levels.
 The Australian dollar  fell 0.2 to $1.0612, having
been hit this week by data showing a slowdown in employment
growth and a statement from the central bank that was
interpreted as showing no urgency to raise rates.

 LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - World stocks headed for their
fifth weekly loss out of the past six on Friday, depressed by
concerns about a slowing global economy and by Europe's ongoing
struggle to control Greek debt.
 The euro slipped against the dollar despite the European

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro struggled to regain its
footing on Friday although it held above one-week lows as
worries about the euro-zone's debt problems overwhelmed any
support from a likely interest rate rise by the European Central
Bank next month.	
 Market participants shifted their focus back to debt
problems in Greece and other euro-zone countries, using that as
an excuse to unwind long euro positions built up over the last
three weeks, when the currency climbed back from a two-month low
below $1.4000 hit on May 23.	
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet signalled that the
benchmark refinancing rate, now at 1.25 percent, would rise next
month. But markets expected as much and had already priced in
the prospect of a July rate hike. 
 The central bank also kept its 2012 inflation forecast
unchanged, suggesting the pace of euro zone interest rate hikes
may be slower than previously thought. 
 ""The ECB's stance regarding inflation and interest rate
rises is not as strong as originally perceived by the market,
and this triggered euro selling. We're likely to see a rate hike
next month, but we aren't sure about the future,"" said Osamu
Takashima, chief forex strategist at Citibank in Tokyo.	
 ""The euro is expected to come under gradual selling pressure
and could aim for $1.42-$1.43 in the near term, while on the
upside it is expected to be weighed down around $1.46.""	
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.4496 in afternoon
Asian trade, having fallen as low as around $1.4477 the previous
day. 
 Solid technical support is seen at $1.4419, a 38.2 percent
retracement of the May 23-June 7 rally.	
 
 RESTRUCTURING FOR GREECE	
 The market was concerned about the ECB's steadfast rejection
of any form of debt restructuring for Greece, which is favoured
by Germany in particular.	
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to 116.14 yen , not too
far away from a one-week low of just under 116.00 yen reached
the previous day.	
""All said and done, investor sentiment is such at the moment
that the discord amongst euro zone policy-makers and their
inability to move beyond stop-gap measures to contain the
sovereign debt crisis continues to dominate investment
decision-making,"" said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of
global FX strategy at BNY Mellon. 
 Not surprisingly, BNY Mellon's flows analysis showed Greek,
Portuguese, Spanish and Italian bonds remained out of favour
among investors.	
 The dollar edged down on the yen as profit-taking
emerged after it reached a one-week high near 80.50 yen.	
 Selling by exporters was more visible this week, with
sizable sell orders lined up near 81 yen, which are expected to
block the dollar's rises, Tokyo dealers said. 
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 80.13 yen after reaching a
one-week high of 80.47 yen.	
 Still, Japanese investors and importers were expected to
show strong dollar-buying interest below 80 yen, dealers said. 
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 to $1.0598, pulling
back after tracking advances in the Korean won on the
South Korean central bank's surprise move to raise its policy
rate by a quarter point. 
 ""The Aussie gained after the BOK rate hike, not because it's
particularly strongly connected to the won, but because the U.S.
dollar weakened against all other currencies after the move,
including the won,"" said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 ""I don't think the Aussie has enough power to advance
further. It was rather scooped up on dips."" 
 The dollar index rose 0.1 percent to 74.2552, near a
one-week high of 74.297 reached on Thursday.	
 The Aussie was hit this week by data showing a slowdown in
employment growth and a statement from the central bank that was
interpreted as showing no urgency to raise rates.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, June 10 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell for a
seventh consecutive day on Friday, led by selling in technology
counters on wariness about the broader economic outlook, while
the euro held above one-week lows as worries about the
euro-zone's debt problems outweighed a likely interest rate rise
by the European Central Bank next month. 
 European shares are set for a weaker start, with bookmakers
seeing main indexes down between 0.2-0.4 percent. 
 
 Economic data from two of Asia's economic engines - China's
trade data and India's industrial output were broadly in line
with market estimates and failed to provide any fresh triggers
to cautious traders.	
 ""Equity valuations are neither expensive nor cheap if you
look at most markets in Asia today. I don't think valuations are
flashing a buy or sell signal at this point in time,"" said Binay
Chandgothia, chief investment officer at Principal Global
Investors. 
 ""So you keep going back to other factors, i.e. your
perceptions on growth, your perceptions on macro policy,"" he
said. His firm manages more than $200 billion in assets
worldwide. 
 Japan's Nikkei - trading at just 1.1 times book
value, the cheapest in the region -- jumped more than 1 percent,
though gave up a big chunk of its gains by the close.	
 Australian shares were up 0.2 percent, easing slightly from
the 1 percent gains after they opened, while Korean shares
turned lower pressured by an interest rate hike.	
 The MSCI index for Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
slipped 0.4 percent, heading for its seventh
consecutive week of losses and is down for the year. 
 The Chinese stock market also trended lower on concerns
over further monetary tightening from Beijing. Chinese shares
were the worst performers in the region in May.	
 Shares of Tencent Holdings , China's most valuable
Internet company, dropped 3.7 percent to a two-month low and
weighed on the broad market in Hong Kong, underscoring the
bearishness in technology shares on Friday. 
 The MSCI index for Asia-Pacific technology shares outside
Japan led declines, falling two percent, led by a
7 percent fall in smartphone maker HTC Corp and
weakness in Hynix Semiconductor .	
 
 BONDS DRAW FUNDS	
 Even as equities registered yet another torrid week, bonds
continued to outperform as data from fund tracker EPFR Global
showed emerging market bond funds received new money aggregating
$1.4 billion in the week to June 8, an eight-month high,
compared to tiny outflows from equity funds.	
 Measured in dollar-adjusted terms, total returns for the
broader JP Morgan GBI-EM Asian index is nearly 2.5 percent so
far this year with gains set to accelerate as most Asian central
banks are set to keep off from tightening policy further.	
 This week alone, four out of five central banks in the
region held interest rates steady with Australia and Indonesia
even injecting a tone of dovishness in their policy statements.	
 ""EM is slowing due to a number of factors, one of which is
the impact of increased tightening as a result of inflationary
pressures brought on by excess global liquidity conditions,""
said Robert O Abad, a U.S.-based analyst with Western Asset
Management, which oversees over $480 billion in assets. 
 Expectations of further quantitative easing by the Fed also
receded after the unexpectedly strong U.S. trade data offered a
glimpse of hope that the world's biggest economy may be
recovering quickly. 
 Abad said that although the end of QE2 would be negative for
technical flows into risky markets, there was an upside. 
 ""It would be a positive for the real economy side of EM as a
deceleration in capital inflows would mitigate the need for
further tightening and capital controls which only curtail
growth,"" he said.	
 In currency markets, the strong U.S. exports data and the
festering euro zone debt crisis, pulled the euro down to a
one-week low against the dollar, even after the European Central
Bank hinted at a July interest rate hike.	
 With the euro on the back foot, the dollar bounced to a
one-week high against a basket of major currencies. The dollar
index briefly rose as high as 74.297, well off a
one-month low of 73.506 set earlier in the week.	
 Bonds suffered with yields on ten-year U.S. Treasury notes
rising back to near the 3 percent line after dipping
to a low 2.94 percent earlier this week.	
 Brent crude oil prices  extended gains to a one-month
high of nearly $120 per barrel after OPEC's surprise failure to
reach a deal on raising output raised concerns of tighter
supplies later in the year.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. and European shares
rebounded on Thursday after a six-day slide and oil prices
jumped, while the euro slipped against the dollar after the
European Central Bank left its inflation forecast for next year
unchanged.
 Data showing record U.S. exports in April tempered worries
about a stalling economic recovery and prompted investors to
pick up beaten-down shares. Commodity-linked stocks led the
advance as oil, gold and silver prices climbed. For more see
[ID:nN09117731].
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.4 percent. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 0.3 percent.
 ""You're seeing exports picking up pretty dramatically, a
positive data point, and a market that had gone down six days
in a row,"" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North
Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago. ""You finally have a
day with a reason for people to start buying stocks again. The
appetite has come back.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended up 75.42
points, or 0.63 percent, at 12,124.36. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 9.44 points, or 0.74 percent, at
1,289.00. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 9.49
points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,684.87.
 Shares of Fusion-io Inc , which makes storage memory
hardware and software for data centers, jumped 18 percent in
their first day of trading.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
advanced 0.9 percent to close at 1,104.43, gaining for the
first session since May 31.
 Oil prices rallied on concerns about supply a day after
OPEC failed to agree on an increase in production targets.
 Brent crude  settled at a five-week high of $119.57
a barrel, up $1.72 on the day. U.S. crude  rose $1.19 to
settle at $101.93, having hit $102.44.
 Spot gold  was last up at $1,544.40 an ounce as gains
in crude oil and grain prices heightened fears of higher
inflation and boosted bullion's allure. Silver  was up 2
percent at $37.56 an ounce.
 The price of U.S. corn  soared to a record high of
$7.93 per bushel after a government report said poor spring
planting conditions reduced this year's crop potential and will
squeeze already tight market supplies.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global benchmark
for commodities, was up 0.7 percent.
 EURO'S SLIDE, GREEK BONDS
 The euro  tumbled to a session low at $1.44777 on
trading platform EBS and was last trading at $1.4509, down 0.5
percent on the day.
 The European Central Bank left benchmark interest rates
unchanged at 1.25 percent. While ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet did signal that rates would rise again next month, the
move had already been priced into the market.
 The ECB left its 2012 inflation forecast unchanged at 1.7
percent, below some forecasts. The steady inflation view
suggested the euro zone's pace of rate increases could slow.
 Investors pared back their outlook for total rate hikes in
the euro zone to about 75 basis points over the next 12 months,
from around 80 before Trichet's press briefing.
 A lack of detail about a new bailout package for Greece and
the possibility of write-offs in the banking sector in the
event of a Greek debt restructuring also soured sentiment.
 Moody's said it would be tough to imagine private creditors
participating voluntarily in a debt restructuring. For details,
see [ID:nFAB016108]
 ""It feels like selling euro upticks against the dollar will
remain the bias, not least because the expected rate hike
signal is out of the way and it is clear that many major
decisions on how to navigate the Greek crisis have not been
taken in either Athens or other European capitals,"" said Alan
Ruskin, global head of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank.
 A new international bailout being put together for Greece
is likely to total around 120 billion euros, euro zone official
sources said on Thursday. That was higher than the 90 billion
euro figure previously suggested by officials. [ID:nLDE75819V]
 U.S. government debt prices fell after an unenthusiastic
bid for the Treasury's $13 billion auction of reopened 30-year

percent earlier, marking the lowest since early December.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday
after the European Central Bank kept its 2012 inflation
forecast unchanged, suggesting the pace of euro zone interest
rate hikes may be slower than previously thought.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet did signal that the
benchmark refinancing rate, now at 1.25 percent, would rise
next month. But markets expected as much and had already priced
in the prospect of a July hike.
 Investors sold the euro after the ECB said inflation would
hold at 1.7 percent in 2012, lower than analysts had expected.
Investors now expect 75 basis points of tightening over the
next year, from around 80 basis points before Trichet spoke.
 Greece worries also weighed on the euro after Moody's said
it would be tough to imagine private creditors participating
voluntarily in a debt restructuring. For details, see
[ID:nFAB016108]
 Trichet said any private sector involvement would have to
be voluntary. Earlier this week, German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble called for a ""quantified and substantial""
contribution from bondholders to any new bailout for Greece.
 ""It feels like selling euro upticks against the dollar will
remain the bias, not least because the expected rate hike
signal is out of the way and it is clear that many major
decisions on how to navigate the Greek crisis have not been
taken in either Athens or other European capitals,"" said Alan
Ruskin, global head of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.4511 , and Ruskin
said $1.4450 was a reasonable short-term target.
 Against the yen, the euro was unchanged at 116.53 ,
while the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 80.28 yen .
 Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.6366  after the
Bank of England kept rates at record lows. [ID:nLAC005850]
 'STRONG VIGILANCE'
 The euro initially rose above $1.46 after Trichet said
""strong vigilance"" was warranted to curb inflation in the
17-country euro zone but then abruptly fell, triggering
automatic sell orders at $1.4600, $1.4550, and $1.4500.
 Investors have come to view the words ""strong vigilance"" as
Trichet's way of signaling a rate increase the following month.
For Trichet's remarks, click on [ID:nFAT007213].
 The last eight times Trichet used those words, the euro
appreciated in the 72 hours that followed, analysts said.
 ""Trichet uttered the fateful code words 'strong vigilance,'
preparing the market for further tightening,"" said GFT Forex
research director Boris Schlossberg. ""However, Trichet also
suggested that the central bank expects inflationary pressures
to moderate in 2012, leading many market participants to
conclude that the action in July may be a one-off event rather
than the start of a series of rate hikes.""
 The focus could now come back to the Greek debt crisis.
News on the debt-ridden country was mixed the last two days and
short-term Greek borrowing costs remained elevated.
 Sources told Reuters a new international bailout for Greece
may total 120 billion euros. Schaeuble said Wednesday Greece
needed 90 billion euros to get through 2014. [ID:nLDE75819V]
 Jens Nordvig, head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura Securities,
said the question in the longer run is whether Greece's debt
woes infect sentiment toward other euro zone countries.
 ""The key unknown is contagion, and in this context the
resilience of bigger countries -- Spain and Italy -- remains
key,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. and European shares
rebounded on Thursday after a six-day slide and oil prices

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks bounced back on
Thursday after a six-day slide and oil prices jumped on supply
concerns, while the euro fell after the European Central Bank
kept its inflation forecast for next year unchanged.
 Financial and energy stocks led the rally on Wall Street,
which pushed the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 up 1 percent
at midday. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.5 percent,
matching the 0.5 percent gain in world stocks as measured by
the MSCI index <.MIWD00000PUS>.
 U.S. crude oil futures  jumped above $102 a barrel
on concerns about supply a day after OPEC failed to agree on
an increase in production targets.
 The euro  tumbled to a session low at $1.44777 om
trading platform EBS and was trading at $1.4526 at midday.
 The catalyst for the euro's fall was provided by the ECB,
which left its 2012 inflation forecast unchanged at 1.7
percent, below some forecasts. The steady inflation view
suggested the euro zone's pace of rate increases could slow.
 As a result, investors pared back their outlook for total

 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet did signal that rates

points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,688.04.
 Shares of Fusion-io Inc , which makes storage
memory hardware and software for data centers, jumped 21
percent in their first day of trading. At midday, the stock
was at $23 -- up from its initial offering price of $19.
 Stock investors viewed a narrowed U.S. trade deficit as
one positive point for growth in a recent avalanche of weak
economic data. But the mood remained fragile with many
analysts expecting the S&P 500 to retest its March 2010 lows
after falling more than 6 percent since a peak in May.
""We're basically trading off technicals,"" said William
Larkin, a portfolio manager with Cabot Money Management in

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar on Thursday after the president of the European Central
Bank signaled an interest-rate increase next month as had been

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - The euro surrendered gains
against the dollar on Thursday after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled a rate hike next month
that already had been widely expected, leaving little room for
further upside in the single currency.
 Traders said asset managers were heavily short the U.S.
dollar against the euro ahead of Trichet's statement and were
poised to sell the single euro zone currency on any rally.
 The euro did rise after Trichet said ""vigilance"" was
warranted, but reversed gains in a sharp move that saw
investors whip through stops below $1.46000 $1.45500, and
$1.45000.
 Trichet, in his statement after the ECB left rates
unchanged at 1.25 percent, used the words ""strong vigilance"".
For the past few years, investors have come to view the words
""strong vigilance"" as Trichet's way of signalling an impending
rate increase the following month.
 For Trichet's remarks, click on [ID:nFAT007213].
 Negative headlines on Greece and wider regional debt
concerns have also raised doubts over the prospects for ongoing
ECB policy tightening and euro strength.
 ""The July rate hike has been fully discounted and the euro
is suffering from a 'sell the fact' price action,"" said Richard
Franulovich, senior currency strategist, at Westpac Securities
in New York.
 The last eight times Trichet used those key words, the euro
appreciated in the 72 hours that followed, analysts said.
 The euro hit a session low at $1.44777 on trading platform
EBS  and was last at $1.44894, down 0.5 percent.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.4 percent at 116.040
.
 With Trichet out of the way, the focus could squarely come
back to the Greek debt crisis. The continued possibility of
Greek debt restructuring was raised again on Wednesday in a
letter from German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble to the
leadership of the ECB, International Monetary Fund and his euro
zone peers.
 ""We are unlikely to see the euro break $1.50 again until
the situation with Greece is sorted out,"" said Kathleen Brooks,
currency strategist at FOREX.com in London.

5.5 percent year-on-year slump. [ID:nATH006146]

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar on Thursday after the chief of the European Central Bank
signaled an interest-rate increase next month as had been
widely expected, while U.S. stocks rebounded after six days of

 The European Central Bank earlier left its benchmark

the central bank is strongly vigilant over inflationary
pressures.
 Investors typically view Trichet's use of the phrase
""strong vigilance"" as a code word for a pending rate hike by
the ECB in the following months. The euro initially rose on the

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - World stocks hit an 11-week low
on Thursday while the cost of insuring Greek and Portuguese debt
against default rose to record highs as concerns persisted over
Greece's ability to finance its debt and the impact on banks.
 The euro was off the day's highs after the European Central
Bank left its benchmark interest rate on hold as expected. ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to signal a July
interest rate hike at a news conference later.
 Investors became jittery about holding risky assets as they
focused on the lack of detail about a new bailout package for
Greece and the possibility of write-offs in the banking sector
if Greece restructures its debt.
 The Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday was of no help
either, as it offered fresh evidence of an economic slowdown
[ID:nN08248761], just as the central bank's bond buying
programme comes to an end this month.
 ""If (the ECB) do not signal an interest rate rise, the
markets will think, why they have decided to keep the flow of
easy money going?"" said Andy Lynch, who manages 2.5 billion
euros ($3.55 billion) for Schroders.
 ""I think that will take the market lower towards the end of
the day as people start worrying about fundamental weakness
across the euro zone.""
The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.15
percent, hitting its lowest since March. The index has fallen
6.8 percent since hitting a three-year high in May.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> erased early gains while
emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> lost 0.5 percent. Shanghai stocks
<.SSEC> fell 1.7 percent to a 4-1/2 month low as concerns rose
about further monetary policy tightening.
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a firmer open on Wall Street
.
 ""The global economy is not tumbling, it's just going through
a turbulence zone. We think that things will get better in the
second half of the year,"" said Vincent Treulet, head of
investment strategy at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which
has 551 billion euros ($808 billion) in assets under management.
 ""The next earnings season will be key. It could be the
positive catalyst the market needs.""
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4610  ahead of the
ECB meeting and President Jean-Claude Trichet's news conference.
 The ECB is expected to use higher staff inflation forecasts
to be published on Thursday to make the case for a tightening in
July. [nLDE7550KT]
 This would be positive for the euro as it raises the single
currency's yield premium, but persistent concerns about the euro
zone debt crisis are slowing its advance.
 In a report obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, the EU, ECB
and IMF mission to Greece said the next disbursement of Greek
aid could not take place until it corrected the under-financing
in its adjustment programme. [ID:nB4E7GU02C] 
 Policymakers appeared to be edging closer to a compromise on
how to structure a second aid package to Greece, but markets
remained sceptical over the immediate impact of any solution
involving private sector bondholders. [ID:nLDE75714O]
 The cost to insure Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt against
default hit record highs, after data showed Greek gross domestic
product contracted more than expected in the first quarter.
 Bund futures  rose 11 ticks to 124.77.
 The dollar <.DXY> was steady against a basket of major
currencies.
 U.S. crude oil  rose 0.8 percent to $101.58 a barrel
after Saudi Arabia failed to convince OPEC members to raise
output targets and data showed U.S. crude stocks fell sharply
last week.

 * Downside risk as attention returns to Greek crisis
 * Dollar up against yen, fails to break 80.40 yen
 By Nia Williams
 LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Thursday, recouping losses in the previous session, as investors
geared up for hawkish signals from the European Central Bank
that would boost the single currency's yield differentials.
 But there was a risk of a correction in the euro if the ECB
appeared dovish by flagging a slower pace of interest rate hikes
later in the year, given a possible global slowdown and the
lingering Greek debt crisis. 
 With many already pricing in the chances of a July rate
hike, the single currency would need a very strong hawkish
signal to test suspected options barriers around $1.4700.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to use higher
staff inflation forecasts at Thursday's post-policy meeting news
conference to justify a case for monetary tightening in July.
 The euro was last up 0.4 percent against the dollar 
at $1.4638, bolstered by bargain hunting from model funds and
speculators.
 A break above $1.4700 would open the door for the euro to
test resistance around $1.4940, the May 4 high. On the downside,
traders said key support was seen in at $1.4550, the 50 percent
retracement of the May 4 to 23 fall.
 Some analysts warned the continued possibility of Greek debt
restructuring, which was raised again on Wednesday in a letter
from German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, meant the euro
could come under pressure after the ECB meeting. [ID:nB4E7G900O]
 ""More significant than the rate hike signal will be
Trichet's comments on the ECB's attitude to Greek debt
situation,"" said Adrian Schmidt, FX strategist at Lloyds. ""He
will be asked about the Schaeuble letter which could throw the
cat among the pigeons.
 ""In the short-term it's hard to see Trichet saying anything
that positive. Once the rate hike is priced in the euro will be
moving primarily on the Greek debt story. Consequently the
downside is favoured today for the euro.""
 A report obtained by Reuters on Wednesday from the EU, ECB
and IMF mission to Greece added to the uncertainty hampering the
euro zone. The report said the next disbursement of Greek aid
could not take place until it corrected the under-financing in
its adjustment programme. [ID:nB4E7GU02C]
 The Bank of England will also announce its June rate
decision on Thursday but is widely expected to keep rates on
hold at record lows. The euro  was last up 0.1 percent
against sterling at 88.99 pence.
 
 YEN RETREATS
 The dollar recouped most of its losses against the yen
having slumped to a one-month low of 79.69 yen . It was
last up 0.2 percent at 80.10 yen.
 Domestic and foreign brokers, as well as margin traders were
buying the greenback on dips. The move alleviated immediate
downside pressure but failed to break through a pivot point at
80.40 yen.
 Despite its gains against the yen, the dollar was down 0.2
percent on a basket of currencies <.DXY> at 73.754 after the
Federal Reserve's beige book summary of economic conditions
confirmed that the economy slowed in May. [ID:nN08248761]
 Investors will look to the release of U.S. initial jobless
claims due at 1230 GMT for further clues on the state of the
world's largest economy, which has endured a recent slew of
lacklustre data.
 Although the perception the Federal Reserve will maintain
ultra-loose monetary policy for some time has weighed on the
dollar, Commerzbank said in a note that a faltering global
recovery could underpin the greenback which usually benefits
from safe-haven flows.
 ""Key rates in the US are not going to change for some time.
As a result the USD might increasingly turn into a financing
currency for carry trades. That would also mean that weak macro
data would once again support the dollar,"" they said in a note.
 The Australian dollar  fell to a two-week low at
$1.0563 on disappointing employment data before finding some
support at $1.0590. It last traded down 0.2 percent at $1.0597.
 New Zealand's central bank held rates steady on Thursday but
also set the stage for higher rates, saying hikes were needed as
the economy bounces back from the Christchurch earthquake.
[ID:nL3E7H709W]
 The more hawkish tone helped the kiwi  rally to last
trade up 0.2 percent at $0.8213.

 * Asian stocks dip slightly, Nikkei and KOSPI down 0.1%	
 * Euro edges up, ECB seen laying groundwork for rate hike	
 * New Zealand c.bank sets stage for higher rates	
 
 HONG KONG, June 9 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped for a
sixth straight day on Thursday as investors cut exposure to
risky assets on signs the global economy is losing steam, even
as oil prices and the high-yielding Australian dollar pushed
higher.	
 Early losses in stocks were mild following a dip on Wall
Street, with Japan's Nikkei average and South Korea's
KOSPI both losing 0.1 percent.	
 The Federal Reserve's beige book summary of economic
conditions confirmed that the economy slowed in May due to
higher gasoline prices and the supply chain disruptions
following Japan's earthquake and tsunami in March.	
 But the report, prepared for the Fed's next policy meeting
later this month, gave few indications of a sharp slowing, with
some regions citing ongoing improvement in the job market and
even a pick up in economic growth. [ID:nN08248761]	
 The dollar slipped as other major currencies gained, pushing
back towards a one-month low struck earlier in the week. The
dollar index , a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 73.816. 
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.4610 before a
European Central Bank policy meeting later in the day at which
the ECB is expected to lay the groundwork for a rate hike in
July, responding to higher inflation. [ID:nL3E7H83NR]	
 The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.0655 ,
while Brent crude oil prices inched up 30 cents to $118.15 a
barrel.
 A slew of data showing the U.S. and other major economies
weakened in May have taken a bite out of stocks and other
riskier assets, leaving market players scrutinizing upcoming
data releases for clues on whether global growth is slowing more
than expected.	
 Later in the day Australian releases its May employment data
expected to show a solid 25,000 increase. Earlier in the week
Australia's central bank showed little inclination to hike rates
further in the near term.	
 New Zealand's central bank held rates steady on Thursday but
also set the stage for higher rates, saying rate hikes were
needed as the economy bounces back from the Christchurch
earthquake. [ID:nL3E7H709W]	
 Oil prices extended gains after OPEC failed to reach a deal
to increase output, raising fears of supply shortfalls later
this year which could push fuel prices higher, weighing further
on the economic recovery.	
 North Sea Brent crude oil futures  rose 27 cents to
$118.12 a barrel after jumping more than a dollar on Wednesday.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell
for a sixth straight day on Wednesday on worries about a bleak
global economic outlook, while oil prices jumped after OPEC
failed to reach an agreement to increase output.
 The U.S. dollar hit a one-month low below 80 yen as risk
aversion rose, but it rallied against the euro after
weaker-than-expected German economic data and on uncertainty
surrounding the resolution of Greece's debt crisis.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday
acknowledged that the U.S. economy had slowed but offered no
hint that the central bank is considering further stimulus to
support growth.
 Bernanke's comments, combined with recent weak U.S. labor
and manufacturing data, helped push benchmark Treasury yields
below the key 3 percent level and stoked fears that a slowdown
in the world's largest economy could dent global growth. For
more, see [ID:nW1E7GV010]
 ""Investors are re-pricing the slowdown after Bernanke
crystallized it,"" said Jason L. Ware, senior equity research
and trading analyst at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake
City. ""The market was hoping for an indication that there may
be another round of stimulus but clearly, that's not what they
got.""
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> slipped 0.8 percent. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> also lost 0.8 percent. Emerging
market stocks <.MSCIEF> dropped 0.7 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed down 0.9 percent at 1094.33 for the sixth day of losses.
It marked the lowest close in nearly three months.
 U.S. stocks also extended losses for the sixth straight
session. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down
21.87 points, or 0.18 percent, at 12,048.94. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 5.38 points, or 0.42 percent,
at 1,279.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 26.18
points, or 0.97 percent, at 2,675.38.
 Brent crude oil  rose $1.07, or 1 percent, to settle
at $117.85 a barrel. U.S. crude  gained $1.65, or 1.67
percent, to settle at $100.74 a barrel.
 OPEC talks broke down without an agreement to raise output
after Saudi Arabia failed to convince other members to lift
production. The news raised fears of supply shortages later
this year and a price rally that could further limit any global
economic recovery. [ID:nL3E7H80BY]
 ""It came as a surprise. It is bullish for prices. If you
look at demand it will be very robust in the next months and
there is a big need for extra OPEC oil,"" said Amrita Sen from
Barclays Capital.
 Spot gold  fell 0.5 percent to $1,534.64 an ounce,
against $1,542.85 late on Tuesday in New York.
 EURO DOWN AHEAD OF ECB
 The dollar was last down 0.2 percent at 79.90 yen 
after hitting as low as 79.67 yen, according to Reuters data.
Traders said losses accelerated after automatic sell orders
were triggered on the greenback's drop below 80 yen.
 The euro  fell 0.8 percent against the dollar to
$1.4570 and was down 1 percent at 116.41 yen  after
German exports posted their biggest drop in more than two years
in April and industry output fell 0.6 percent. [ID:nLDE7570B7]
[ID:nLDE75706Q]
 Uncertainty over Greece's debt crisis also dented demand
for the euro. A report by the European Union, European Central
Bank and International Monetary Fund obtained by Reuters
indicated that the next disbursement of Greek aid could not
take place until after it corrected under-financing in the
country's adjustment program. [ID:nB4E7GU02C].
 Greece sealed a 110 billion euro aid deal a year ago but
has failed to restore confidence in its finances. German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Athens needs an
additional 90 billion euros in a second package that will get
the country through 2014. [ID:nB4E7H6005]
 Despite debt worries, analysts still expect the European
Central Bank to raise interest rates again this year to counter
inflation. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to
hint at a July rate hike after Thursday's policy meeting.
 A warning from Fitch Ratings that the United States
probably would not be able to maintain its prized AAA sovereign
ratings status if it suffered even a ""technical"" default on its
debt had little impact on the dollar and Treasury prices.
 Yields on 10-year notes  were at 2.95 percent,
down from 3.00 percent late on Tuesday. The yield on 10-year
U.S. paper was about 9 basis points below that of 10-year
German Bunds, the widest spread in a month.
 ""Ironically, Treasuries could rally"" if global markets are
shaken up by a U.S. default, said Steve Van Order, fixed income
strategist with Calvert Investment Management Inc. ""Look what
happened in 2008: we were the source of that whole financial
crisis and yet the dollar went up and Treasury yields fell.""
 Calvert is a Bethesda, Maryland-based firm with $14.5
billion in assets under management.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The dollar and yen rose on
Wednesday as worries that a slowing U.S. economy may stall
global growth fueled a bid for currencies seen as safe havens.
 Adding to growth concerns was persistent uncertainty
surrounding the resolution of Greece's debt crisis.
 A report by the European Union, European Central Bank and
International Monetary Fund obtained by Reuters on Wednesday
indicated that the next disbursement of Greek aid cannot take
place until it corrects under-financing in the country's
adjustment program. For details see [ID:nB4E7GU02C].
 As a result, the euro slumped, commodity currencies fell
and the yen rose as high as 79.693 per dollar , its
strongest since May 5. Investors unwound trades financed by
borrowing yen at low interest rates as fears grew that slower
global growth would hurt higher-yielding assets.
 The same dynamics lifted the dollar against the euro and
high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar, traders
said. Low U.S. interest rates make the dollar, like the yen, a
popular funding currency.
 ""There has been a general shunning of risky assets because
of concerns about global growth, which of course take root here
in the United States,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst
at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington.
 ""These concerns have boosted safe-haven currencies such as
the dollar and yen.""
 Data last week showing U.S. hiring slowed sharply in May
stoked anxiety about the global outlook. Investors grew more
risk-averse after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said
late Tuesday the recovery remained fragile. [ID:nN07142566]
 The ICE dollar index, a measure of its value against six
major currencies, rose 0.6 percent to 73.955 <.DXY>.
 The yen rose against both the dollar and euro, with the
greenback falling to a one-month trough at 79.693 yen 
on trading platform EBS. The dollar was last down 0.2 percent
at 79.890 yen.
 Traders said losses accelerated after a series of automatic
sell orders were triggered on the greenback's drop below 80
yen. More ""stop-loss"" barriers were said to be below 79.50.
 The euro fell 1.0 percent to 116.411 yen  and was
off 0.8 percent at $1.45683 , hurt by an unexpected 0.6
percent decline in German industrial output. [ID:nB4E7GN03F]
 The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar  shed 0.9
percent to US$1.0611, while the greenback rose 0.5 percent
against the Canadian dollar  to C$0.9792.
 A warning by Fitch Ratings that it could downgrade
America's credit rating if the U.S. government fails to raise
its legal borrowing limit and misses some coupon payments had
little impact on the dollar. But it did highlight the country's
mounting fiscal problems, which could have a long-term impact
on the greenback. [ID:nLDE7571VB]
 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington, said the ""market is leaning toward
expecting the debt ceiling will be raised before the U.S.
defaults. We view default as a very limited probability.""
 He called Europe's debt crisis more troubling, saying it
remained unclear whether Greece would adopt the new austerity
measures needed to secure a second bailout aimed at giving it
more time to repay its debt. [ID:nLDE7571OA]
 But analysts still expect the ECB to raise interest rates
again this year to counter inflation, and its president,
Jean-Claude Trichet, is widely expected to hint at a July rate
hike after Thursday's monthly policy meeting.
 ""Trichet is expected to reintroduce the words 'strong
vigilance' to his (statement) and if he does, it could send
euro/dollar toward $1.48. But if his lips do not utter those
words tomorrow, expect euro/dollar to crash down toward $1.45,""
said Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT in New York.
 For the past few years, investors have come to view the
words ""strong vigilance"" as Trichet's way of signaling an
impending rate hike the following month.
 Sterling, meanwhile, fell against the euro and dollar
  after credit rating agency Moody's
repeated a warning that the UK could lose its prized triple-A
rating if it misses economic targets. [ID:nLDE7570KF]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell
for a sixth straight day on Wednesday on worries about a bleak
global economic outlook, while oil prices jumped after OPEC
failed to reach an agreement to increase output.
 The U.S. dollar hit a one-month low below 80 yen as risk
aversion rose, but it rallied against the euro after
weaker-than-expected German economic data and on uncertainty
over a second Greek bailout package.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday
acknowledged that the U.S. economy had slowed but offered no
hint that the central bank is considering further stimulus to
support growth.
 Bernanke's comments, combined with recent weak U.S. labor
and manufacturing data, helped push benchmark Treasury yields
below the key 3 percent level and stoked fears that a slowdown
in the world's largest economy could dent global growth. For

 ""The question marks regarding the growth dynamics for the
global economy are becoming bigger and this is weighing on the
markets,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist at
UniCredit.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> slipped 0.7 percent. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> also lost 0.7 percent. Emerging
market stocks <.MSCIEF> dropped 0.7 percent as well.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed down 0.9 percent at 1,094.33 for the sixth consecutive
day of losses. It marked the lowest close in nearly three
months.
 U.S. stocks fell in choppy trading, with gains in energy
shares failing to offset bearish sentiment stemming from
Bernanke's comments.
 At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> was down 25.24 points, or 0.21 percent, at 12,045.57.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 5.75 points, or
0.45 percent, at 1,279.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
lost 26.90 points, or 1.00 percent, at 2,674.66.
 The S&P 500 index could fall roughly 10 percent from its
current level as the Fed winds down its second round of bond
buying at the end of the month, Credit Suisse U.S. equity
strategist Doug Cliggott told the Reuters 2011 Investment
Outlook Summit in New York. [ID:nN08238462]
 Brent crude oil  was last up $1.20 at $117.98 a
barrel. U.S. crude  rose $2.03 to $101.12.
 OPEC talks broke down without an agreement to raise output
after Saudi Arabia failed to convince other members to lift
production. The news raised fears of supply shortages later
this year and a price rally that could further limit any global
economic recovery. [ID:nL3E7H80BY]
 ""It came as a surprise. It is bullish for prices. If you
look at demand it will be very robust in the next months and
there is a big need for extra OPEC oil,"" said Amrita Sen from
Barclays Capital.
 EURO DOWN AHEAD OF ECB
 The dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 79.80 yen 
after hitting as low as 79.67 yen, according to Reuters data.
Traders said losses picked up speed after a series of automatic
sell orders was triggered on the greenback's drop below 80 yen.
More ""stop-loss"" barriers were said to be below 79.50.
 The euro  fell 0.7 percent against the dollar to
$1.4597 and was down 1 percent at 116.46 yen  after
German exports posted their biggest drop in more than two years
in April and industry output fell 0.6 percent, confounding
expectations for an unchanged reading. [ID:nLDE7570B7]
[ID:nLDE75706Q]
 In addition, Greece needs substantial fresh aid from the
euro zone to avoid the currency bloc's first state insolvency,
a German newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. [ID:nB4E7G900O]
 The cost of insuring Greek and Portuguese debt against
default rose, while the premium investors demand to hold Greek,
Portuguese and Irish government bonds rather than benchmark
German Bunds also increased.
 Despite worries about Europe's debt crisis, analysts still
expect the European Central Bank to raise interest rates again
this year to counter inflation. ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet is widely expected to hint at a July rate hike after
Thursday's monthly policy meeting.
 U.S. government bonds rose despite a Fitch Ratings warning
that the United States probably would not be able to maintain
its prized AAA sovereign ratings status if it suffered even a
""technical"" default on its debt. Investors were instead focused
on a sputtering economic recovery.
 Yields on 10-year notes  were last at 2.94
percent, down from 3.00 percent late on Tuesday. The yield on
10-year U.S. paper was about 9 basis points below that of
10-year German Bunds, the widest spread in a month.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1534.95 an ounce, against
$1,542.85 late in New York on Tuesday.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-month low
against the yen on Wednesday while commodity-linked currencies
and the euro also slumped for fear that a slowing U.S. economy
may put the brakes on global growth.
 The yen was a top performer, rising as high as 79.69 per
dollar , its strongest since May 5. It also gained
against the euro as investors unwound trades that were financed
with cheaply borrowed yen.
 Investors, already rattled by recent data showing U.S.
employers added fewer jobs than expected last month, grew more
risk averse after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said
late Tuesday the recovery remained fragile. [ID:nN07142566]
 ""He didn't say anything particularly new but he said it as
the market was already getting more dovish on the outlook
because of the recent weak economic data,"" said David Mann,
senior strategist at Standard Chartered in New York.
 ""But there are reasons to be more bullish about the second
half of the year, and if incoming data improves U.S. growth
expectations, things may start going the other way,"" he said.
 If that doesn't happen and the yen rises further, traders
said long yen positions could become dangerous as Japanese
authorities may try to talk the currency lower. A strong yen
makes it harder for Japan to grow its way out of a deep
recession made worse by the damage caused by this year's
earthquake and tsunami.
 ""The thing to watch is if we start to see moves becoming
more volatile,"" Mann said.
 The dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 79.79 yen, and
traders said losses picked up speed after a series of automatic
sell orders were triggered on the greenback's drop below 80
yen. More ""stop-loss"" barriers were said to be below 79.50.
 The euro fell 0.9 percent to 116.58 yen  and was
off 0.5 percent at $1.4615 , hurt by an unexpected 0.6
percent decline in German industrial output. [ID:nB4E7GN03F]
""Given that Germany is the engine for growth in the euro zone
the industry output figures add to the steady drip drip of bad
news,"" said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of
New York Mellon.
 But analysts still expect the European Central Bank to
raise interest rates again this year to counter inflation, and
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is widely expected to hint at
a July rate hike after Thursday's monthly policy meeting.
 Mann said the euro could still make a run at the year's
high around $1.4940 before staging any meaningful correction.
 Traders said Greece's woes were on the backburner for now
on the view that the country will likely receive a second
emergency aid package to give it more time to pay its debts.
 The more cautious tone in the market for now also hurt the
high-yielding, commodity-sensitive Australian dollar ,
which shed 0.9 percent to $1.0619, while the greenback was up
0.7 percent against the Canadian dollar  at C$0.9808.
 Sterling fell against the euro and dollar 
 after credit rating agency Moody's repeated a warning
that the UK could lose its prized triple-A rating if it misses
economic targets. [nLDE7570KF]

 LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - European stocks fell on Wednesday
and the dollar dropped to a one-month low against the yen after
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered a grim view
of the economy but failed to offer hints of fresh stimulus.
 Concerns about growth in the world's largest economy have
dominated financial markets this month, and European stocks fell
to their lowest levels since mid-March, driving global stocks
0.5 percent lower on the day. <.MIWD00000PUS>
 U.S. equity futures were down 0.4 percent at 1,279.00.

 Bernanke acknowledged the U.S. economy had slowed down but
offered no suggestion the central bank was willing to step in
with a third round of bond buying -- a form of quantitative
easing -- to support growth. The dollar fell in response.
[ID:nW1E7GV010]
 ""QE3 looks as though it's become a distant hope. The markets
had pinned quite a lot on getting another form of stimulus,""
said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven Investment
Management.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 1 percent at 1,093.32 points, plumbing a two-and-a-half
month low and a sixth straight day of losses.
 Uncertainty over whether European policymakers will manage
to pin down a deal for further financial aid for Greece also
hampered sentiment towards the euro zone.
 The euro  briefly rose to a one-month high of $1.4696
in Asia as the dollar floundered, but later eased to $1.4648,
off around 0.3 percent for the day, knocked by a slump in German
exports and a fall in industrial output. [ID:nB4E7GN03F]
 The cost of insuring Greek and Portuguese debt against
default rose as investors fretted over the possibility of a
Greek debt restructuring and due to the risk aversion sweeping
through markets. [ID:nLDE7570J6]
 German government Bunds rose around 13 ticks ,
though outperformance in U.S. Treasuries overnight saw the yield
on 10-year U.S. paper fall to 9 basis points below that of
Bunds, the most in a year.
 ""Bernanke was dovish and it's the U.S. data that will set
the tone from here,"" said one bonds trader. ""We're not out of
the woods with the euro zone periphery either and the last thing
they need is a slow-down in growth.""
 Greece needs substantial fresh aid from the euro zone to
avoid the currency bloc's first state insolvency, a German
newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble. [ID:nB4E7G900O]
 
 OIL SLIDE
 The dollar hovered near a one-month low under 80 yen 
as the Japanese currency firmed on the heightened risk-aversion
reflected in falls in share prices. The dollar index was also
within sight of one-month lows of 73.506 hit on Tuesday <.DXY>
 Poor signs on growth add to market conviction that U.S.
interest rates will stay low for an extended period, while the
European Central Bank is expected to signal on Thursday it will
push forward with a further rise in interest rates next month.
 Brent crude  fell 0.5 percent to $116.36 a barrel,
after gaining $2.30 on Tuesday. Investors are trying to assess
whether OPEC will raise production targets at a meeting in
Vienna.
 ""Oil prices have been softening this morning on the back of
expectations that today's OPEC meeting could bring a increase in
production to match estimates of growth in oil demand,"" said
Jane Foley, senior currency analyst at Rabobank.
 ""High commodities prices are being associated with soft U.S.
growth and since QE may be a factor behind the acceleration in
prices in this sector, the outlook for oil prices is a crucial
element in policymakers' decisions."" she added.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to a one-month
low against the yen on Wednesday and stayed under broad selling
pressure across the board on the view that a slow U.S. economic
recovery will keep interest rates low well into next year.
 Sterling was also under fire, falling to a one-month low
versus the euro and a session low against the dollar on a media
report of a Moody's warning the UK could lose its AAA rating if
it missed economic targets. [ID:nWEA5035] 
 The yen rose broadly in technical trading, pushing down the
dollar to 79.75 yen -- its lowest since May 5 -- after a series
of stop-loss orders were triggered as the U.S. currency failed
to sustain technical support slightly below 80 yen.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday
acknowledged the U.S. economy has slowed, fuelling more
speculation that rates will stay chained near zero. His comments
followed a run of dismal data on U.S. jobs and manufacturing
last week. [ID:nN07142566]
 While he made no mention of the need for more economic
stimulus, market participants saw the possibility of additional
quantitative easing after the current round ends this month, if
the economy continues to struggle.
 ""Signs of weakness in the U.S. economy has led to a weaker
dollar, and so long as the market speculates about the
possibility of another round of quantitative easing, this will
weigh on the dollar,"" said You-Na Park, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 The dollar  traded at 79.95 yen in early European
trade, clawing back from its lows as traders cited demand from
Japanese corporate and retail names as offering some support.
 Major stop-loss sell orders were cited around 79.50 yen,
close to a low of 79.57 yen reached on May 5.
 The euro was little changed on the day at $1.4670 ,
holding gains made in the past two weeks, although its topside
was capped ahead of a hefty options barrier suspected at $1.47.
 Market participants cited selling by Asian sovereign names
ahead of that level.
 Above $1.4700, the euro faces resistance at $1.4732, a 78.6
percent retracement of its May 4-23 fall. A break of that could
take it back to the May 4 peak around $1.4939, ahead of the
psychological level of $1.5000.
 Against the pound, the euro  hit a one-month high
of 89.76 pence, leaving it on course for a test of the key 90
pence level. Sterling lost around 70 pips against the dollar
 to hit a session low of $1.6355.
 
 MORE EURO GAINS
Many investors expect the euro to push higher, as the ECB on
Thursday is widely expected to flag a rate rise for next month,
reinforcing the view that euro zone rates will rise much faster
than U.S. ones.
 While concerns about the impact of Greece's debt problems on
the rest of the euro zone will continue to haunt the single
currency, the ECB has signalled it is determined to keep raising
rates to tame inflation risks.
 Buoyancy in stronger euro zone countries including Germany
is also seen as adding to the argument for higher rates.
 With this in mind, investors awaited a reading of revised
euro zone Q1 growth and German industrial production for April
later in the day. Some analysts said the euro may suffer some
selling if the figures come in weak.
 ""We expect the ECB to signal a rate hike in July with
Trichet's usage of ""strong vigilance"" in his post-announcement
speech tomorrow,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a note.
 ""However, any weakness in these two figures today may weigh
on market expectations for the next hike, which will likely keep
EUR trading heavy.""
 While ongoing signs of a struggling U.S. economy has stung
the dollar, it has also prompted investors to dump riskier
assets. This pushed both the higher-yielding Australian and New
Zealand dollars   down 0.6 percent on the day.
 Some in the market said the Aussie was also under selling
pressure due to a media report which was bearish on the
Australian currency.

 By Nick Macfie	
 SINGAPORE, June 8 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Wednesday
and the dollar wavered after uninspiring comments from U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke added to worries about the
slowing global economy.	
 European shares were also expected to fall, extending
their losing streak to a sixth straight session, tracking
weakness in Asia and on Wall Street. Financial spreadbetters
expected Britain's FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX
to fall as much as 0.5 percent and France's CAC 40 to
open down as much as 0.6 percent. 
 Bernanke acknowledged an economic slowdown in the United
States, but offered no suggestion of further stimulus to support
growth, souring sentiment across equity markets and towards the
dollar as investors expect U.S. interest rates to remain low for
a longer period of time.[ID:nW1E7GV010]	
 The dollar slipped to a one-month low under 80
yen as the Japanese currency was bought back broadly amid
heightened risk-aversion reflecting the falls in Asian share
prices. 
 The Nikkei average ended about 0.1 percent
higher , with gains in financials helping to temper weakness
in other sectors.	
 MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside
Japan fell 0.7 percent and looked set for its fifth
straight losing session. Consumer discretionary and resources
shares continued to see the heaviest selling on fears of cooling
demand.	
 ""When you see the weaker U.S. dollar, people do get
concerned about the global growth story,"" said Justin Gallagher,
head of sales trading at RBS Australia in Melbourne.	
 Lorraine Tan, director of Asia equity research at S&P
in Singapore, said the markets were in a ""major semi-lull"". 
 ""We don't expect much in the near term without fresh
developments,"" she said. ""There is concern over what's going to
be happening with global growth. Double-dip (recession) worries
will come back."" 
 The euro briefly rose to a one-month high of $1.4696
as the dollar floundered, but later slipped back to $1.4658, off
around 0.1 percent.	
 Fears of a Greek debt default were expected to limit further
advances for the single currency.	
 Greece needs substantial fresh aid from the euro zone to
avoid the currency bloc's first state insolvency, a German
newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble. 
""We are facing the real risk of the first uncoordinated state
insolvency within the euro zone,"" die Welt newspaper quoted
Schaeuble as writing in a letter to, amongst others, European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet.	
 The paper said Schaeuble argued for a new bailout of Greece
with a ""substantial"" expansion of European aid and with private
creditor involvement 
 The euro also rose against the yen on Japanese
institutional demand.	
 
 OIL EXTENDS SLIDE	
 Brent crude  fell 0.4 percent to $116.34a barrel,
after gaining $2.30 on Tuesday. Investors are trying to assess
whether OPEC will raise production targets.	
 Gold slipped to $1,540 but analysts see plenty of
room for its continued rise as investors retreat from riskier
assets.	
 Gold is still well below a lifetime high around $1,575
touched in early May, but with the U.S. dollar under pressure,
equities markets falling and the debt crisis in Europe far from
over, bullion continues to be one of the chief beneficiaries of
the latest bout of market volatility.	
 Tan said gold would be supported by fundamentals and
sentiment over the weak U.S. dollar. 
 ""We think it will stay relatively firm,"" she said. 
 U.S. stocks fell for a fifth day on Tuesday after Bernanke's
comments. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly
0.2 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index
slipped 0.1 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell for a fifth
day and the dollar weakened on Tuesday after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged a slowdown in the economy,
but offered no suggestion of further monetary stimulus to
support growth.
 The weaker dollar helped boost crude oil prices, though
gains were limited by expectations that OPEC will raise its
production targets this week and by worries that an economic
slowdown will erode demand.
 ""U.S. economic growth so far this year looks to have been
somewhat slower than expected,"" Bernanke told a banking
conference. He said the recovery was still weak enough to
warrant keeping in place the Fed's strong monetary support,
saying the economy was still growing well below its full
potential.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 19.15
points, or 0.16 percent, to end at 12,070.81. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 1.23 points, or 0.10 percent, to
finish at 1,284.94. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> shed
1.00 point, or 0.04 percent, to close at 2,701.56.
 ""The market is taking the comments as a sign the economy is
not really in the recovery mode, that Bernanke is going to hold
off on rates for much longer than the market had anticipated
before, well into 2012,"" said Jonathan Xiong, senior portfolio
manager of global asset allocation at Mellon Capital Management
in San Francisco.
 ""The equity market is just taking that as a sign that it's
not really good news, that he sees something that maybe the
valuations in the equity market are not picking up.""
 Earlier, Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist said U.S.
stock indexes could fall as much as 10 percent from their May
highs, but barring unexpected shocks, should not return to a
bear market. For details, see [ID:nN07126450]
 A 10 percent correction from the May 2 peak of 1,370 would
put the benchmark S&P 500 index at 1,233.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.2 percent, snapping a four-session
decline as investors bought beaten-down shares. The Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 0.3 percent.
Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> also climbed 0.3 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
surrendered early gains to close down a fraction at 1,104.05,
the lowest close since mid-March. It has lost 3.3 percent in
the five sessions so far in June.
 DOLLAR WEAKENS, CRUDE GAINS
 The dollar fell below 80 yen for a second straight day
following Bernanke's comments. The pair last traded at 80.05
yen, down 0.1 percent on the day .
 The U.S. currency earlier hit a record low against the
Swiss franc and a one-month trough against the euro after a
Chinese official said China must be alert to the risk of
holding too many dollars at a time when Washington is pursuing
loose monetary and fiscal policies. [ID:nL3E7H71AA]
 The dollar fell as low as 0.8327 Swiss francs . It
also slid 0.6 percent against a basket of major currencies,
<.DXY> to 73.506, its lowest in a month. The euro hit a
one-month high of $1.4696 .
 Expectations the Fed will keep benchmark interest rates
near zero for longer, even as other major central banks are
tightening, have weighed on the dollar in recent months.
 The European Central Bank is expected on Thursday to signal
a second rise in rates this year, which could offset worries
about a potential Greek debt restructuring.
 Oil prices rose as the weaker dollar and Middle East
turmoil lifted prices, but news that Saudi Arabia planned to
raise output in June regardless of the result of OPEC's
Wednesday meeting helped limit Brent's gains and put pressure
on U.S. crude futures.
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose $2.30 to settle
at $116.78 a barrel. U.S. July crude  edged up 8 cents to
settle at $99.09 a barrel.
 Spot gold  earlier rose as high as $1,550 an ounce,
before pulling back to trade little changed at $1,543.99.
 Long-dated Treasuries joined shorter-term Treasuries in the
plus column after Bernanke's comments as prices firmed
narrowly.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes , which were
slightly lower before Bernanke spoke, rose 1/32 afterward.

By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled late on
Tuesday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments
about the economy's lackluster growth affirmed expectations
U.S. interest rates will remain low for a long time.
 He made no indication, however, that the central bank will
undertake further monetary easing.
 The dollar was down sharply before Bernanke spoke after a
senior Chinese currency regulator warned about investing too
heavily in dollar-denominated assets at a time when Washington
is pursuing loose monetary and fiscal policies.
 In prepared remarks at a banking conference in Atlanta,
Bernanke said U.S. growth ""looks to have been somewhat slower
than expected,"" but added that the latest bout of economic
weakness would not last long. He expects stronger growth in the
second half. For details, see [ID:nW1E7GV010]
 ""My interpretation of his comments is that there would be
no QE3 (further quantitative easing), which means monetary
policy would remain loose, interest rates will remain low. It
would be steady as she goes,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""We saw some weakness in the dollar, although it was
limited.""
 In late afternoon trading, the euro rose 0.8 percent to
$1.46890 . It hit as high as $1.46910 immediately
after Bernanke's remarks, not far from a one-month high of
$1.46966 reached earlier in the session.
 The dollar fell to session lows beneath 80 yen following
Bernanke's remarks but last traded at 80.055 yen ,
little changed on the day.
 Dollar weakness was earlier triggered by comments from a
Chinese currency official.
 In an article posted on the website of the China Finance 40
Forum, a Beijing-based think tank, Guan Tao said his country
must be alert to the risk of holding too many dollars.
[ID:nL3E7H71AA]
 Guan's comments were later removed from the website.
 Traders said they added to existing pressure on the dollar
and underscored recent moves by China and others to add more
euros, yen, and other currencies to their dollar-heavy
portfolios.
 The dollar as a result hit a record low against the Swiss
franc at 0.83270 , and was last at 0.83654, up 0.3
percent on the day.
 The euro, meanwhile, benefited from news that plans for a
second bailout of Greece are taking shape, with a proposal for
a three-year package worth 80 to 100 billion euros set to be
ready in the next two weeks, euro zone official sources said.
[ID:nLDE7560TC]
 As Greece concerns abate, central bank policy has moved
back to the forefront. Rate differentials are a primary driver
for the euro's nearly 10 percent gain against the dollar this
year.
 The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates at
zero percent well into 2012. The European Central Bank raised
rates in April and is expected to hint at another hike in July
when it holds its next policy meeting on Thursday.
 Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura
Securities in New York, said at the Reuters 2011 Investment
Outlook Summit in New York that he expects the dollar to
""continue its weak trend"" if global economic data is modestly
weak.
 The dollar will benefit from risk aversion only if global
data becomes much weaker or ""if there is another banking
crisis,"" he said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
major currencies on Tuesday after a senior Chinese currency
regulator warned about the risks of excessive dollar holdings,
while stocks rebounded as investors bought beaten-down shares.
 The weaker dollar helped Brent crude oil prices rise above
$116 a barrel, though gains were limited by expectations that
OPEC will raise its production targets this week and by worries
that an economic slowdown will erode demand.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.5 percent, snapping a four-session
decline. The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU>
gained 0.6 percent. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> climbed
0.4 percent.
 The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc and a
one-month trough versus the euro after Guan Tao of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said China must be alert to
the risk of holding too many dollars at a time when Washington
is pursuing loose monetary and fiscal policies. For details,
see [ID:nL3E7H71AA]
 ""It's a sensitive topic for markets, and it does seem that
China has had its fill of dollars,"" said BNY Mellon strategist
Michael Woolfolk.
 The dollar fell as low as 0.8327 Swiss francs . It
also slid 0.6 percent against a basket of major currencies,
<.DXY> to 73.514, its lowest in a month. The euro hit a
one-month high of $1.4694 .
 U.S. stocks rose a day after the S&P 500 index hit its
lowest in more than two months. Some investors are looking for
further volatility and a possible move lower before equities
stabilize.
 Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist said U.S. stock
indexes could fall as much as 10 percent from their May highs,
but barring unexpected shocks, should not return to a bear
market. [ID:nN07126450]
 ""I think we are in a correction,"" Citigroup's Tobias
Levkovich said at the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit in
New York. ""We're just going to struggle along here, and there
will be bouts of rallies and pullbacks."" A 10 percent
correction from the May 2 peak of 1,370 would put the benchmark
S&P 500 index at 1,233.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 51.01
points, or 0.42 percent, at 12,140.97. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 6.66 points, or 0.52 percent, at
1,292.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 12.11
points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,714.67.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
surrendered early gains to close down a fraction at 1,104.05,
the lowest close since mid-March. It has lost 3.3 percent in
the five sessions so far in June.
 BERNANKE AHEAD
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke could provide clues
on the U.S. central bank's view of the economic slowdown and
the timing of the Fed's exit from its extremely easy monetary
policy at 3:45 p.m. EDT (1945 GMT) on Tuesday, when he is
scheduled to speak.
 The dollar has been under pressure in recent months, hurt
by worries about the U.S. economic recovery and expectations
the Fed will keep benchmark interest rates near zero for
longer, even as other major central banks are tightening.
 The European Central Bank is expected on Thursday to signal
a second rise in rates this year, which could offset worries
about a potential Greek debt restructuring.
 Brent crude rose as the weaker dollar and Middle East
turmoil lifted prices, but news that Saudi Arabia planned to
raise output in June regardless of the result of OPEC's
Wednesday meeting helped limit Brent's gains and put pressure
on U.S. crude futures.
 Brent crude oil  was up $2.64 at $117.12 a barrel.
U.S. crude  rose 45 cents to $99.46 a barrel.
 Spot gold  earlier rose as high as $1,550 an ounce.

 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
major currencies on Tuesday after a senior Chinese currency
regulator warned about the risks of excessive dollar holdings,
while stocks rebounded as investors bought beaten-down shares.
 The weaker dollar helped Brent crude oil prices rise above
$116 a barrel, though gains were limited by expectations that
OPEC will raise its production targets this week and by worries
that an economic slowdown will erode demand.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.5 percent, snapping a four-session
decline. The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU>
also gained 0.5 percent. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF>
climbed 0.4 percent.
The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc and a
one-month trough versus the euro after Guan Tao of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said China must be alert to
the risk of holding too many dollars at a time when Washington
is pursuing loose monetary and fiscal policies. For details see
[ID:nL3E7H71AA].
 ""It's a sensitive topic for markets, and it does seem that
China has had its fill of dollars,"" said BNY Mellon strategist
Michael Woolfolk.
 The dollar fell as low as 0.8327 Swiss francs . It
also slid 0.5 percent against a basket of major currencies
<.DXY> to 73.532, its lowest in a month. The euro hit a
one-month high of $1.4692 .
 U.S. stocks rose a day after the S&P 500 index hit its
lowest in more than two months. Some investors are looking for
further volatility and a possible move lower before equities
stabilize.

 ""I think we are in a correction,"" Citigroup's Tobias

correction from the May 2 peak of 1,370 would put the benchmark
S&P 500 index at 1,233.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 70.16
points, or 0.58 percent, at 12,160.12. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 7.53 points, or 0.59 percent, at
1,293.70. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 13.30
points, or 0.49 percent, at 2,715.86.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
surrendered early gains to close a fraction down at 1,104.05,
the lowest close since mid-March. It has lost 3.3 percent in
the five sessions so far in June.
 BERNANKE AHEAD
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke could provide clues
on the U.S. central bank's view of the economic slowdown and
the timing of the Fed's exit from its extremely easy monetary
policy at 3:45 p.m. (1945 GMT) on Tuesday when he is scheduled
to speak.
 The dollar has been under pressure in recent months, hurt
by worries about the U.S. economic recovery and expectations
that the Fed will keep benchmark interest rates near zero for
longer, even as other major central banks are tightening.
 The European Central Bank is expected on Thursday to signal
a second rise in rates this year, which could offset worries
about a potential Greek debt restructuring.
 Brent crude rose as the weaker dollar and Middle East
turmoil lifted prices, but news that Saudi Arabia planned to
raise output in June regardless of the result of OPEC's
Wednesday meeting helped limit Brent's gains and put pressure
on U.S. crude futures.
 Brent crude oil  was up $1.30 at $115.78 a barrel.
U.S. crude  briefly turned higher before retreating to
$98.49 a barrel, off 53 cents.
 Spot gold  earlier rose as high as $1,550 an ounce.
It later pulled back to trade at $1,542.89 as investors took
profits on the metal's 5 percent rally in the past three
weeks.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices remained lower after a solid

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low
against the Swiss franc and fell against other currencies on
Tuesday after a senior Chinese currency regulator warned about
the risks of investing too heavily in dollar-denominated
assets.
 In an article posted on the website of the China Finance 40
Forum, a Beijing-based think tank, Guan Tao said his country
must be alert to the risk of holding too many dollars at a time
when Washington is pursing loose monetary and fiscal policies.
 ""The United States may find it hard to resist the policy
temptation of weakening the dollar abroad and pushing up
inflation at home,"" Guan said. [ID:nL3E7H71AA]
 While Guan's comments did not reflect a new concern and
were later removed from the website at his request, traders
said they did add to existing pressure on the dollar and
underscored recent moves by China and others to add more euros,
yen and other currencies to their dollar-heavy portfolios.
 ""It's a sensitive topic for markets, and it does seem that
China has had its fill of dollars,"" said BNY Mellon strategist
Michael Woolfolk. ""The move higher in the euro overnight
stemmed from those comments.""
 China's foreign exchange reserves exceed $3 trillion, and
economists estimate as much as 70 percent is held in dollars.
 Traders said the Chinese comments added to an anti-dollar
bias in the market, fed by recent weak U.S. economic data and
worries about the country's massive budget deficit.
 The dollar hit a record low of 0.8327 Swiss francs
 and is down nearly 11 percent against the currency
this year.
 The euro hit a one-month high of $1.4682 , helped
partly by better-than-expected German factory data, before
easing to $1.4673 up 0.6 percent. The dollar fell 0.1 percent
to 80.17 yen .
 ""Since last week attention had been focusing on uncertainty
about the U.S. economy. The dollar was already biased towards
the downside, and these remarks from the Chinese authorities
are just another reason to sell,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman,
European head of currency strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank.
 The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates at
zero percent well into 2012, a view that gained credence last
week after data showed the U.S. economy added far fewer jobs
than expected in May.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will be speaking on the U.S.
outlook at 3:45 p.m. in Atlanta (1945 GMT) on Tuesday, his
first appearance after last week's employment report.
 The European Central Bank raised rates in April and is
expected to hint at another hike in July when it holds its next
policy meeting on Thursday.
 The euro also got a boost after a senior government
official said the Greek government expects parliament to vote
on a medium-term austerity plan this month, which would meet
one of the conditions for receiving new international funding.
 The euro has gained more than 4 percent from its May 23
low. The immediate target for the common currency is $1.4732, a
78.6 percent retracement of its May 4 to May 23 fall.
 A break of that level should take it back to the May 4 high
around $1.4939, though many traders said that will require a
hawkish signal from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet.
 The Australian dollar was flat at $1.0708, moving away from
Friday's four-week high of $1.0775 after the Reserve Bank of
Australia kept rates on hold and gave no hints of tightening in
the immediate future.
 But the New Zealand dollar climbed nearly 1 percent against
the greenback to $0.8212 as investors bought it ahead of a
central bank rate decision on Thursday.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly on
Tuesday, hurt by a warning from a Chinese official of the risks
in holding huge dollar assets while European equities rebounded
as investors picked up beaten-down shares.
 The weaker dollar helped Brent crude oil prices rise back
above $114 a barrel though gains were limited by expectations
that oil cartel OPEC will raise its production targets this week
and worries that an economic slowdown will erode demand.
 The greenback hit a one-month low against the euro and a
record low versus the Swiss franc after a Chinese foreign
exchange official said the dollar would continue to weaken
against other major currencies and warned of risks in holding
""excessive"" U.S. assets. [ID:nB9E7EM022]
 It slid 0.5 percent against a basket of major currencies to
73.556 <.DXY>, its lowest in a month, and plumbed 0.8328 Swiss
francs  on trading platform EBS -- a record low.
 ""China has been growing its share of U.S. securities quite
aggressively in the past and the threat that they will be
selling these holdings has always been there,"" said Adam Myers,
senior forex strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""This is not a credible threat as a sell-off will lead to a
steepening of the U.S. yield curve which will hurt the U.S. and
the Chinese, who are dependent on the U.S. economy. But I do
agree that the dollar is headed lower in the long term.""
 U.S. debt prices were slightly weaker but this was largely
due to the rebound in equities, with benchmark Treasury note
yields up about three basis points at 3.024 percent .
 The dollar has been persistently weak in recent months due
to worries about the solidity of the U.S. economic recovery and
expectations that interest rates, most notably in the euro zone,
will continue to be raised significantly faster.
 The European Central Bank is expected at its meeting on
Thursday to signal a second rise in rates this year, offsetting
the impact on the euro of concerns that Greece will eventually
have to restructure its debt.
 The euro jumped to a one-month high of $1.4682 , up
0.6 percent on the day and up more than 4 percent since it
bottomed out against the dollar on May 23.
 Investors will look to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke at 1945 GMT for more clues on the U.S. central
bank's view of the economic slowdown and its impact, if any, on

 MILD EQUITIES BOOST
 European shares snapped a four session slide with investors
picking up beaten-down stocks, notably in the utilities and
basic resources sectors, though worries that the global recovery
was stalling after a spate of weak U.S. data capped gains.
The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was up 0.3 percent, clawing back from an 11-week closing low on
Monday.
 The European advances helped world stocks as measured by
MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> up 0.2 percent, and followed gains in Asian
markets.
 ""Shares in Asia were higher so that's giving us a mild boost
and some people think the falls yesterday may have been a bit
overdone,"" said Markus Huber, senior trader at ETX Capital. 
 U.S. stock index futures also pointed to a firmer open on
Wall Street, with futures for the S&P 500 , Dow Jones
 futures, and Nasdaq 100  up 0.5-0.6 percent.
 U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Monday said recent
economic data has been disappointing, with one suggesting it
could delay the Fed's exit from its extremely easy monetary
policy.
 Brent crude oil for July delivery  edged back above
$114 a barrel, bolstered by the dollar's weakness, but gains
were muted on the possibility that OPEC might raise its output
targets this week and worries about the demand outlook.
 Earlier, Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul-Kareem Luaibi said world
oil markets were well supplied and prices were not too high. The
comments suggest Iraq may not support the increase in OPEC
output that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers favour.
 London Brent was last up 0.2 percent at $114.75, having
fallen as low as $113.80 earlier.
 Spot gold  was bid firmer at $1,549.00 per ounce,
after closing at $1,543.05 on Monday, boosted by the weaker
dollar. Gold, one of the chief beneficiaries of worries about
the security of currencies and other assets, set a record high
of $1,575.79 per ounce in early May.

 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a one-month
low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday and a record low
against the Swiss franc after a Chinese official said the
greenback would continue to weaken versus other major
currencies.
 The head of the international payment department at the
Chinese forex regulator also warned about the risks of excessive
holdings of U.S. dollars. [ID:nB9E7EM022]
 The dollar index <.DXY> fell to a low of 73.601, the lowest
since May 5, while the greenback fell to 0.8328 Swiss francs
 on trading platform EBS -- a record low.
 ""China has been growing its share of U.S. securities quite
aggressively in the past, and the threat that they will be
selling these holdings has always been there,"" said Adam Myers,
senior forex strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""But this is not a credible threat as a sell-off will lead
to a steepening of the U.S. yield curve which will hurt the U.S.
and the Chinese, who are dependent on the U.S. economy. But I do
agree that the dollar is headed lower in the long term.""
 The euro rose to its highest in a month, climbing to $1.4666
 on EBS, up nearly 0.6 percent on the day. Traders cited
option barriers at $1.47 which could check gains in the near
term.
 The common currency had got a boost in early European trade
after a senior government official said the Greek government
expects parliament to vote on its medium-term austerity plan by
the end of June, a move which will fulfil a condition to receive
new international funding. [ID:nLDE756071]
 The euro has gained more than 4 percent from its May 23
trough. The immediate target for the common currency is $1.4732,
a 78.6 percent retracement of its May 4 to May 23 fall.
 A break of that level should take it back to the May 4 high
around $1.4939, though many traders think the currency will need
a signal from European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet
this week that the institution is ready to raise rates in July.
 Earlier in the session, the euro slipped after Eurogroup
chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said the common currency was
overvalued.
 ""Euro is still clear of crisis levels, but flows are very
choppy and investors are awaiting a solution from the IMF, EU,
ECB, the private bond-holders and Greece,"" said Lena Komileva,
head of G-10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 ""It is more of a momentum lift for the euro than anything
fundamental.""
 With market views mixed on the euro, implied volatilities on
euro/dollar options have eased as few market players see the
need to hedge against sharp moves in the pair. One-month
euro/dollar volatility slipped to around 11.40 percent
, near its lowest in a month.
 
 BERNANKE IN FOCUS
 While the euro hit one-month highs, worries about a
faltering U.S. economy have boosted market expectations for the
Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for longer, making
the dollar an attractive funding currency.
 A fall in U.S. shares to 2-1/2 month troughs is fanning
expectations that the Fed is eager to keep rates low for a
protracted period, with some market players even talking about
the possibility of QE3 after the current asset buying programme,
dubbed QE2, is completed at the end of this month.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will be speaking on the U.S.
economic outlook at 3:45 p.m. in Atlanta (1945 GMT) on Tuesday,
his first appearance after Friday's U.S. job data that cemented
the view that the U.S. economy has hit a soft patch.
 Against the yen, the dollar crept up to 80.22 yen ,
after a brief dip below 80.00 on Monday for the first time since
May 5, helped by bids from Japanese importers.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0687
, moving further away from Friday's four-week high of
$1.0775 after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates on hold
and gave no hints of tightening in the immediate future.
 Its statement surprised some market players by omitting a
warning that policy would likely have to tighten in coming
months to contain inflation, leading markets to trim the risk of
a move in July or August.

 By Daniel Magnowski	
 SINGAPORE, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro ticked up in Asia on
Tuesday, steadying from a slide after the Eurogroup chairman
said the common currency was overvalued, while Asian stocks fell
for a fourth day on worries about slowing global growth.	
 European stocks were expected to lose ground for the fifth
session in a row after the S&P index shed 1.1 percent
overnight, hitting its lowest level since mid-March. 
 The euro came under pressure on Monday after Jean-Claude
Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup, made his comment about
valuation and a spokesman for the German finance ministry said a
second aid program for debt-laden Greece was not certain.
[ID:nLDE7550KZ}	
 ""Those comments (from Juncker) probably weighed on the euro
at the margin. But the direction of a weaker dollar is pretty
clear this point in time, so I'm expecting a bounce in the
euro,"" said Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at
Commonwealth Bank. 
 The euro traded at $1.4606 at 0538 GMT on
Tuesday, having fallen as low as $1.4555.	
 The single currency has gained more than 4 percent since
climbing from its May 23 trough versus the dollar. Despite fears
that Greece will eventually default on its debt, the euro is
being supported by persistent U.S. dollar weakness and
expectations that the European Central Bank will signal a July
interest rate rise at its policy meeting on Thursday.	
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies on Tuesday.	
 Investors will be closely following a speech by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at 1945 GMT for more clues
on the U.S. central bank's view of the slowdown and its impact,
if any, on the Fed's exit from its extremely easy monetary
policy.	
 
 The Nikkei average rose 0.7 percent to 9,444
points as short covering of utilities and some
bargain-hunting offset selling on fears that U.S. growth may be
stalling, analysts said.	
 ""When the Nikkei trades below 9,400 institutional investors
buy global cyclical shares as a long-term investment and retail
investors tend to buy defensive shares with high dividend
yields, such as drugmakers,"" said Fujio Ando, a senior managing
director at Chibagin Asset Management.	
MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside of Japan
index fell 0.4 percent, with consumer
discretionary and resources shares giving up the most ground on
concerns that global demand is cooling. 
 Technical indicators suggest further declines may
be on the horizon, analysts at Barclays Capital said in a
research note.	
 ""Various topping patterns in equity markets from different
regions suggest the risk of an ongoing corrective pullback in
equity markets over the summer,"" they said.	
 Brent crude oil for July delivery  fell 60 cents
to $113.88 a barrel , extending Monday's fall when it closed
at its lowest in two weeks, on expectations that OPEC will raise
production targets when it meets this week.	
 U.S. gasoline prices fell for the fourth week in a row last
week as crude prices recoiled, relieving some pressure on
consumers and reinforcing the views of some economists that the
current economic ""soft patch"" will be temporary.	
 U.S. retail sales reports due later in the day may signal
whether lower fuel prices enticed shoppers back into the stores
in recent weeks.	
 Gold was around $1.50 higher at $1,544.65 per
ounce by 0535 GMT, after closing at $1,543.05 on Monday.
Gold, one of the chief beneficiaries of worries about the
security of currencies and other assets, set a record high of
$1,575.79 per ounce in early May.	
 The Australian dollar , the world's fifth-most
traded currency, fell below $1.0700 after the Reserve Bank of
Australia held rates steady at 4.75 percent, as widely expected.
The Aussie was trading around $1.0745 before the decision.	
 Markets had been expecting it to repeat an earlier warning
that rates would likely have to rise in the next few months in
order to put a lid on price pressures, but no such indication
was given, prompting some economists to push back their
expectations on the timing of the next rate rise to August.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - Major stock markets fell for a
fourth session on Monday on concerns about slowing global
economic growth, while the euro slipped after a German official
suggested a second Greek bailout was not yet certain.
 Losses in U.S. and European shares paled in comparison with
a more than 10 percent tumble in Peru's stock market after a
presidential election victory by left-wing former army
commander Ollanta Humala stoked fears of a roll-back in
free-market reforms.
 Crude oil prices were lower ahead of an OPEC meeting later
this week, weighed by growing signs that high prices are
destroying energy demand in the West.
 On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index hit a more than
two-month low after May's weak U.S. labor and manufacturing
data pushed stocks to five weeks of losses. The index is down
more than 5 percent from its May high, but still up nearly 3.0
percent for the year.
 ""This seems like a continuation of sentiment from last
week, where investors are coming to the realization that the
economy is not growing as strongly as once anticipated,"" said
Wasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at USAA
Investment Management in San Antonio, Texas.
 ""The weak economic data throughout last week corroborated
those suspicions and because of that you are seeing the
continuation (of the equities slide).""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 61.30
points, or 0.50 percent, at 12,089.96. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 13.99 points, or 1.08 percent, at
1,286.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 30.22
points, or 1.11 percent, at 2,702.56.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> fell 0.6 percent
to 1,104.97, an 11-week closing low.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.8 percent. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> dropped 0.9 percent. Emerging market
stocks <.MSCIEF> shed 0.6 percent.
 Investors dumped Peru's financial assets, triggering
freezes in stock trading and a currency intervention by the
central bank as investors doubted Humala's vows to manage the
economy prudently.
 Peru's stock market <.IGRA> sank more than 12 percent,
while the sol currency  fell 1.5 percent, prompting the
central bank to offer to sell about $215 million in deposit
certificates aimed at curbing the currency's fall.
 Joyce Chang, global head of emerging markets research at
JPMorgan, said the ""market has probably overreacted a bit"" and
recommended investors look for buy opportunities in Peruvian
debt.
 ""I think that there's probably going to be at this stage of
the game more positive than negative surprises. We would
frankly look for opportunities to add exposure,"" Chang told the
Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.
 GREEK BAILOUT NOT CERTAIN
 The euro last traded 0.5 percent lower at $1.4566. It
dipped below $1.46  after a spokesman for the German
finance ministry said a second aid program for Greece was not
yet certain.
 The currency extended declines after Jean-Claude Juncker,
the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, said the euro is
""objectively overvalued.""
 Policymakers have inched toward a new bailout package that
German media said could exceed 100 billion euros, which helped
the euro hit a one-month high of $1.4658.
 Traders said the market assumes a deal will be reached to
allow Greece more time to repay its debt and that markets were
already bracing for European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet on Thursday to signal plans to raise euro zone interest
rates in July.
 ""The focus will turn toward interest rate differentials,
and with the Federal Reserve unlikely to do anything this year,
an ECB rate hike will pull money toward the euro and other
currencies,"" said Boris Schlossberg, head of currency research
at GFT in New York.
 U.S. crude  closed below $100 a barrel, settling at
$99.01, down $1.21, or 1.21 percent. Brent crude oil 
settled at $114.48 a barrel, down $1.36, or 1.18 percent. It
was the lowest settlement since May 24, when Brent crude closed
at $112.53.
 At an OPEC meeting this week, the cartel could lift its oil
production targets, although leading member Saudi Arabia is
likely to face tough opposition in its push to raise supply
from hawks Venezuela and Iran.
 Concerns about the economy fueled fresh gains for
safe-haven gold, with spot gold  up 0.1 percent at
$1,542.79 an ounce. The metal hit a session high of $1,553.30,
its loftiest since early May.

benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  yielded 3.01

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - The euro faltered on Monday
after two days of gains, pressured by a German official's
comment that a second Greek bailout was not yet certain,
although belief that Greece will be able to avert default on
its massive debt should limit the currency's losses.
 Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the euro zone finance
ministers, further fueled selling in the euro in the afternoon
session when he said the currency was overvalued. He made the
comment before the European Parliament's economic committee in
Strasbourg, France. See [ID:nBRU011530].
 Policymakers have inched toward a new bailout package for
Greece that German media said could exceed 100 billion euros.
 That helped push the euro to a one-month high of $1.46590
early in the session on trading platform EBS. But the euro
slipped after a spokesman for the German finance ministry said
a second aid program was not certain and after Juncker made his
valuation remarks. The euro was last down 0.5 percent at
$1.45650 .
 Greece received a 110-billion-euro aid package a year ago.
For more see [ID:nB4E7GU00T] and [ID:LDE7551RS].
 However, traders said the market expects to see a deal that
gives Greece more time to repay its debt.
 ""We're seeing a bit of a corrective pullback in the euro
after gains last week and in general the euro remains sensitive
to headlines on Greece,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency
strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of details to
fine-tune on Greece's second aid plan, but overall, I see
everything working out. It is clear that the EU won't allow
Greece to fail.""
 Eurogroup chairman Juncker said as much on Monday, saying
everything should be done to save Greece. See [ID:nBRU011531].
 Investors are also looking to Thursday's European Central
Bank meeting, at which ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is
expected to hint at a July interest rate hike.
 ""The focus will turn toward interest rate differentials,
and with the Federal Reserve unlikely to do anything this year,
an ECB rate hike will pull money toward the euro and other
currencies,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at
GFT Forex. ""There's no reason whatsoever to own dollars now.""
 If Trichet hints at a July rate hike by talking tough on
inflation, Schlossberg said the euro could retest a 2011 high
around $1.4940.
 Trichet, speaking in Montreal, added to the market's
hawkish view on euro zone interest rates by reiterating the
need to prevent commodity price increases from triggering
second-round effects on inflation. [ID:nN06286699].
 For now, options barriers were stacked around $1.47000,
traders said, with resistance also seen at $1.47100 -- the 76.4
percent retracement of the euro's May decline.
 Some currency portfolio managers have also shifted back
toward a long euro position in the latest week, according to
Quaesta Capital, a $3.5 billion fund of funds based in Zurich,
Switzerland.
 The dollar hit a one-month low beneath 80 yen before
rebounding to 80.130 yen , down about 0.2 percent. Asian
sovereigns were said to be dollar buyers below the 80 level.
 Commodity currencies also benefited from weakness in the
greenback. The Australian dollar traded at US$1.0700 ,
near Friday's 3-1/2-week high of US$1.0775.
 The dollar index <.DXY> dipped as low as 73.643 -- a trough
not seen since May 5. A recent spate of soft U.S. data has
raised concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy. A
report Friday showed a sharp slowdown in job creation, pushing
the unemployment rate up to 9.1 percent. [ID:nOAT004818]
 But by late afternoon, the dollar index was up 0.3 percent
at 74.015.
 With the Fed not likely to lift interest rates for some
time, investors should continue to short the dollar,
""especially against capacity-constrained, rising-interest-rate
currencies like the Indian rupee  and Brazilian real
,""said Faros Trading head of research Dan Dorrow.

 Policymakers have inched toward a new bailout package that

 NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - Major stock markets fell for a
fourth session on Monday on concerns about slowing global
economic growth, while the euro slipped after a German official
suggested a second Greek bailout was not yet certain.
 Losses in U.S. and European shares paled in comparison to a
more than 10-percent tumble in Peru's stock market after a
presidential election victory by left-wing former army
commander Ollanta Humala stoked fears of a roll-back in
free-market reforms.
 Crude oil prices were lower ahead of an OPEC meeting later
this week, weighed by growing signs that high prices are
destroying energy demand in the West.
 On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index hit a more than
two-month low after last week's weak U.S. labor and
manufacturing data pushed stocks to five weeks of losses. The
index is down more than 5 percent from its May high, but still
up nearly 3.0 percent for the year.
 ""This seems like a continuation of sentiment from last
week, where investors are coming to the realization that the
economy is not growing as strongly as once anticipated,"" said
Wasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at USAA
Investment Management in San Antonio, Texas.
 ""The weak economic data throughout last week corroborated
those suspicions and because of that you are seeing the
continuation (of the equities slide).""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 20.13
points, or 0.17 percent, at 12,131.89. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 6.28 points, or 0.48 percent, at
1,293.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 8.67
points, or 0.32 percent, at 2,724.16.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> fell 0.6 percent
to 1,104.97, an 11-week closing low.
 World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.4 percent. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> dropped 0.6 percent. Emerging market
stocks <.MSCIEF> shed 0.4 percent.
 Investors dumped Peru's financial assets, prompting freezes
in stock trading and a currency intervention by the central
bank as investors loudly doubted left-wing Ollanta Humala's
vows to manage the economy prudently.
 Peru's stock market <.IGRA> sank more than 12 percent,
while the sol currency  fell 1.5 percent, prompting the
central bank to offer to sell about $215 million in deposit
certificates aimed at curbing the currency's fall.
 Joyce Chang, global head of emerging markets research at
JPMorgan, said the ""market has probably overreacted a bit"" and
recommends investors look for buy opportunities in Peruvian
debt.
 ""I think that there's probably going to be at this stage of
the game more positive than negative surprises. We would
frankly look for opportunities to add exposure,"" Chang told the
Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday after
a German official suggested a second Greek bailout was not yet
certain, but traders said the prospect of higher euro zone
interest rates would probably limit the currency's losses.
 Policymakers have inched toward a new bailout package for
Greece that German media said could exceed 100 billion euros,
and that helped the euro hit a one-moth high of $1.4658.
 It dipped below $1.46  after a spokesman for the
German finance ministry said a second aid program was not yet
certain. It was last down 0.1 percent at $1.4612.
 Greece received a 110 billion euro aid package a year ago.
[ID:nB4E7GU00T]
 Traders, though, said the market assumes a deal will be
reached to allow Greece more time to repay its debt and that
markets also were already bracing for ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet to signal on Thursday plans to raise euro zone interest
rates in July.
 ""The focus will turn toward interest rate differentials,
and with the Federal Reserve unlikely to do anything this year,
an ECB rate hike will pull money toward the euro and other
currencies,"" said Boris Schlossberg, head of research at GFT
Forex. ""There's no reason whatsoever to own dollars now.""
 If Trichet uses the phrase ""strong vigilance"" when talking
about inflation pressure, a hint that rates will rise in July,
Schlossberg said the euro could retest its 2011 high around
$1.4940.
 For now, options barriers were stacked around $1.4700,
traders said, with resistance also seen at $1.4710 -- the 76.4
percent retracement of the euro's decline in May.
 The dollar also hit a one-month low at 79.97 yen before
rebounding to 80.20 yen , down about 0.1 percent. Asian
sovereigns were said to be dollar buyers below 80 yen.
 Commodity currencies also benefited from weakness in the
greenback. The Australian dollar was up 0.2 percent at $1.0747
, near Friday's 3-1/2 week high of $1.0775. It remained
some way off a 29-year peak of $1.1012 set on May 2.
 BNP Paribas quantitative currency strategist James
Hellawell said short-term momentum indicators pointed to more
euro/dollar gains, but this was due to the dollar generating
strong bearish momentum rather than a notable improvement in
euro sentiment.
 The dollar index <.DXY> dipped as low as 73.643 -- a trough
not seen since May 5. A recent spate of soft U.S. data has
raised concern about the strength of the U.S. economy. A report
Friday showed a sharp slowdown in job creation, pushing the
unemployment rate up to 9.1 percent. [ID:nOAT004818]
 With the Fed not likely to lift interest rats for some
time, investors should continue to short the dollar, said Faros
Trading head of research Dan Dorrow, ""especially against
capacity-constrained, rising-interest-rate currencies like the
Indian rupee  and Brazilian real .""

 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-month
high against the dollar on Monday, boosted by prospects of an
ECB rate hike and a fresh Greek bailout deal, while concerns
about the U.S. economy sent stocks tumbling.
 On government debt markets, growth worries outweighed
expectations of fresh aid for Athens, supporting demand for
safe-haven assets to send Bund futures  higher.
 The single currency  continued a recent strong run
after a review of Greece's accounts by international lenders on
Friday allayed fears of a near-term default and opened the way
for an injection of fresh funds. [ID:nLDE7520MP]
 But it shed some of its gains after Germany's finance
ministry said a lenders' inspection report on Greece was not
expected until mid-week and all options remained on the table.
[ID:nB4E7GU00T]
 The prospect of extra aid, totalling up to 100 billion euros
($146.4 billion) according to German news magazine Der Spiegel,
will not answer the question of Greek solvency in the longer
term but would buy more time for the regional laggard.
 It also leaves the path open for a further rate hike as the
European Central Bank looks to rein in inflation, a goal given
fresh impetus after euro zone producer prices rose in April.
[ID:nLDE7550T9]
 The data reinforced a belief the ECB will signal a July rate
rise to 1.50 percent at Thursday's meeting.
 ""This is likely to provide further near-term support to the
euro, given that the markets' focus now appears to be turning
back to (U.S./euro zone) interest rate differentials following
likely agreement on further support for Greece,"" Howard Archer,
chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said.
 The euro was trading at $1.4614 at 1031 GMT, with a test of
$1.50 expected in the coming weeks if the currency can push
through resistance at $1.4710.
 By 1031 GMT the dollar index <.DXY> had recovered from lows
to trade up 0.1 percent.
 ""The provisos (for more euro gains) are that U.S. equity
markets fail to undergo a deeper correction and that Greece's
political opposition does not scupper fresh austerity measures,""
BNP Paribas strategists wrote in a report.
 Greece's cabinet will debate the austerity plans on Monday
as popular protests swell and Prime Minister George Papandreou
seeks to avoid the fate of socialist peers in bailed-out
peripheral peer Portugal, which voted in a new centre-right
government on Sunday. [ID:nLDE7540LE] [ID:nLDE7550F3]
 Concerns over the outlook for growth in the world's largest
economy following dire U.S. non-farm payrolls numbers on Friday
sent Asian shares down overnight and drove fresh falls for
European stocks. 
 By 1032 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> had recovered
slightly to trade down 0.4 percent.
 After closing out a fifth week of losses on Friday in
response to the jobs data, U.S. stock index futures
<.DJc1> point to a mixed Wall Street open on Monday.
 The poor data meant the pressure ""is on the downside for
European equities"", Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital,
said.
 Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> shed 0.1 percent, the MSCI
world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> 0.1 percent and the Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> 0.2 percent.
 Prospects for reduced energy demand from the United States
weighed on crude futures , with the European
regional benchmark's July contract down 0.8 percent by 1034 GMT.
 An OPEC meeting this week could see the group lift its oil
production targets, although leading member Saudi Arabia is
likely to face tough opposition in its push to raise supply from
hawks Venezuela and Iran.
The jobs data and weaker dollar also fuelled fresh gains for
gold, with spot gold  at around 1,545 an ounce and
targeting technical resistance at around $1,550 an ounce.

 BUNDS
 At 1035 GMT, the Bund future was 23 ticks higher at 125.45,
as analysts said the potential for more Greek aid could yet
pressure safe-haven debt.
 ""The bearish bias could continue for a little bit ... We
should see further relief as (a second) bailout package is
somehow shaping up,"" said Commerzbank strategist Rainer
Guntermann. ""This is what the market is starting to anticipate
so there's probably some more downward correction in store.""
 Short-dated Greek debt yields  dipped in
response to the aid hopes but the lack of clarity over a
long-term fix to Greece's problems meant demand was scant,
particularly for longer-dated maturities.
 Greek two-year yields  were 34 basis points
lower on the day at 23.26 percent, while five-year credit
default swaps were up 15 bps at 1,385 bps, according to Markit.

 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-month
high against the dollar on Monday, boosted by expectations of a
European Central Bank rate increase and a fresh Greek bailout
deal, while U.S. growth concerns sent stocks tumbling.
 The single currency continued its recent strong run after a
positive review of Greece's accounts by international lenders on
Friday allayed fears of a near-term default and opened the way
for an injection of fresh funds. [ID:nLDE7520MP]
 The prospect of extra aid, totalling up to 100 billion euros
($146.4 billion) according to German news magazine Der Spiegel,
will not answer the question of Greek solvency in the longer
term but would buy more time for the regional laggard.
 Key for the euro , it also leaves the path open for a
further near-term rate hike as the European Central Bank looks
to rein in inflation. The ECB is expected to signal a July
increase at its policy setting meeting on Thursday.
 ""We believe that the ECB is set to signal on Thursday that
the next rate hike will be in July and this positive interest
rate dynamic will continue to help the euro,"" said Elsa Lignos,
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The euro was trading at $1.4622 at 0806 GMT, with a test of
$1.50 expected in the coming weeks if the currency can push
through resistance at $1.4710.
 ""The provisos are that U.S. equity markets fail to undergo a
deeper correction and that Greece's political opposition does
not scupper fresh austerity measures,"" BNP Paribas strategists
wrote in a report.
 Greece's cabinet is due to debate the austerity plans on
Monday as popular protests swell. [ID:nLDE7540LE]
 ""A move higher towards our target of 1.5000 also requires
that the ECB issue the requisite code word signalling July
tightening after Thursday's Council meeting.""
 The addition of a sharply weaker U.S. non-farm payrolls
number on Friday to a growing batch of weak economic data buoyed
the euro and other major currencies against the dollar, although
by 0806 GMT the dollar index <.DXY> had recovered to trade flat.
 Concerns over the outlook for growth in the world's largest
economy sent Asian shares down overnight and also underpinned
fresh falls for European stocks at the open, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> down 0.5 percent by 0807 GMT.
 After starting the year strongly, the index is down 1.2
percent in the year to date, with many observers expecting
rangebound trade over the summer.
 ""After Friday's poor economic data the pressure is on the
downside for European equities,"" Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at
ETX Capital, said. ""But the index could find some support near
the 1,100 mark.""
 ""This figure is near its low of April and represents a
number which the market has previously bounced off.""
 Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> were also lower in early
trade, down 0.1 percent, while the MSCI world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> was down 0.1 percent and the Thomson Reuters
global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> was 0.3 percent weaker.
 Prospects for reduced demand from the United States also
weighed on crude futures   in early trade, with the
European regional benchmark's July contract down 0.8 percent by
0809 GMT.
 A meeting of OPEC later in the week could see the group lift
its oil production targets, although leading member Saudi Arabia
is likely to face tough opposition in its push to raise supply
from hawks Venezuela and Iran.
The jobs data and weaker dollar also fuelled fresh gains for
gold in Asian trade, with spot gold  at around 1,544.30 an
ounce and targeting technical resistance at around $1,550 an
ounce.
 
 BUNDS
 Bund futures  were slightly higher in early trade as
the prospect of a fresh aid package for Greece was more than
offset by broader concerns over global economic growth.
 At 0814 GMT, the Bund future was 2 ticks higher at 125.46.
 In spite of the early move higher, however, the prospect of
fresh aid for Greece could yet pressure safe-haven debt in the
short-term.
 ""The bearish bias could continue for a little bit ... We
should see further relief as (a second) bailout package is
somehow shaping up,"" said Commerzbank strategist Rainer
Guntermann.
 ""This is what the market is starting to anticipate so
there's probably some more downward correction in store.""

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-month
high against the dollar on Monday, boosted by progress over
Greek debt financing and a potential widening of interest rate
differentials, enticing hedge funds to buy the single currency.
 The euro has jumped almost 4 percent in the past three weeks
as Greece has inched closer to securing fresh aid to stave off
the threat of a default.
 The EU and IMF have made clear a new bailout package, which
would replace a 110 billion euro deal agreed only a year ago,
depends on Athens keeping to its promises for further austerity
and accelerated privatisations. [ID:nLDE755021]
 A new package might cost more than 100 billion euros ($144
billion), German news magazine Der Spiegel said. [ID:nLDE75408S]
 Despite no long-term solution in sight for the euro zone's
debt crisis, the euro is seen rising ahead of the European
Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday, when the bank is
expected to prepare markets for an interest rate hike in July.
 Such an outcome would widen rate differentials in the euro
zone's favour.
 ""We believe that the ECB is set to signal on Thursday that
the next rate hike will be in July and this positive interest
rate dynamic will continue to help the euro,"" said Elsa Lignos,
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The common currency rose to a one-month high in Asia of
$1.4659 . It last stood at $1.4650, up 0.1 percent from
Friday's close. Traders said hedge funds were keen buyers of the
euro in early European trade, while stop-loss orders were at
$1.4670/80.
 Technical analysts highlighted resistance at $1.4710 -- the
76.4 percent retracement of the euro's decline in May. But given
the negative sentiment building against the dollar, some
analysts are targeting a move to $1.50 in coming weeks.
 ""The provisos are that U.S. equity markets fail to undergo a
deeper correction and that Greece's political opposition does
not scupper fresh austerity measures,"" BNP Paribas strategists
wrote in a report.
 ""A move higher towards our target of 1.5000 also requires
that the ECB issue the requisite codeword signalling July
tightening after Thursday's Council meeting.""
 Many expect the central bank to sound hawkish on inflation
after its policy meeting and to use the key phrase ""strong
vigilance"", which usually flags a coming hike.
 Speculators slashed their net long euro position in the
international monetary market to a fifth of what it was a month
ago -- another factor suggesting that the common currency may
have room to rebound further. [IMM/FX]
 
 DOLLAR FLOUNDERS
 By contrast, the dollar was stuck near a fresh one-month low
hit against a basket of currencies after dire jobs data
bolstered expectations that U.S. interest rates will stay low
for longer.
 The Fed staying on hold for longer could mean the dollar may
be in for a renewed slide and serve as a carry trade funding
currency, boosting commodities and precious metals anew while
putting downward pressure on the greenback against emerging
Asian currencies.
 The dollar index <.DXY> dipped as low as 73.643 -- a trough
not seen since May 5 -- after the closely watched non-farm
payrolls report last Friday showed a sharp slowdown in job
creation, pushing the unemployment rate up to 9.1 percent from
9.0 percent. [ID:nOAT004818]
 Having skidded to a one-month low near 80.00 yen on Friday,
the greenback stood at 80.26  after meeting strong offers
from hedge funds at Monday's Asian session high around 80.40
yen, Japanese bank dealers said.
 Commodity currencies also benefited from weakness in the
greenback. The Australian dollar last traded up 0.4 percent at
$1.0757 , near Friday's 3-1/2 week high of $1.0775.
Still, it was some way off a 29-year peak of $1.1012 set on May
2.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, June 6 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-month high
on Monday, heading toward $1.50 ahead of a European Central Bank
policy meeting later this week, an upward march that could bring
commodity prices and emerging market currencies along with it.	
 The weakest U.S. jobs growth in eight months in May has
knocked the dollar lower across the board and pushed down
Japanese stocks to a two-month low, confirming for investors
that the global business cycle has shifted to slower growth and
a defensive stance in portfolios is desirable.	
 The falling dollar has in turn pushed up the euro, which
despite no solution in sight for the euro zone's debt crisis may
find some traction this week and support commodity prices. 
 Follow the U.S. jobs data, the two outstanding questions for
investors are if the synchronised slowdown reflected in
industrial indicators around the globe is a warning of something
worse on the horizon and whether monetary policy can again come
to the rescue of major economies. 
 For that reason, this week's meetings of the ECB, embroiled
in questions about the need for more Greece aid, the Bank of
England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Korea
will be focal points for investors.	
 The euro was steady at $1.4633 after earlier hitting
a one-month high above $1.4650 in the wake of the May U.S.
payrolls data on Friday. The euro has bounced nearly 4 percent
in the past three weeks, helped by hopes that Greece is close to
securing billions of euros in aid.	
 
 MORE GREEK DRAMA	
 A new aid package for Greece could cost more than 100
billion euros ($144 billion), German news magazine Der Spiegel
said in its latest issue to appear on Monday. [ID:nLDE75408S]	
 Even with tens of thousands of Greeks taking to the streets
to protest austerity measures yet to become law and European
leaders still debating what to do about the country's mountain
of debt, traders have been growing increasingly numb to the news
flow surrounding Greece.	
 After speculators slashed their net long euro position in
the International Monetary Market to a fifth of what it was a
month ago, market positioning is not standing in the way of a
further rebound in the common currency.	
 The next major obstacle for the euro on charts is $1.4710 --
the 76.4 percent retracement of the move down from $1.4940 to
$1.3968. Given the negative sentiment building against the
dollar though, $1.50 may draw the euro like a magnet. 
 The ECB may take the opportunity on Thursday after its
policy meeting to prepare markets for an interest rate increase
in July, an outcome that would widen rate differentials into the
euro zone's favour.	
 ""The ECB is likely to send a relatively hawkish message --
after all, growth in the euro area has been amongst the most
resilient (and data surprises the least negative),"" Barclays
Capital strategists said in a note.	
 ""It is therefore quite possible that the euro retests higher
levels, especially against the backdrop of an improvement of the
picture for peripheral bond markets."" 
 The euro has drawn the attention of global investors because
of how closely other markets have been tracking the currency's
ups and downs.	
 The positive correlation between the euro and the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index of 19 commodity prices was
running at more than twice its historical average, suggesting
the strong likelihood that euro strength also will mean strength
in commodities prices.	
 
 VALUE IN JAPAN? 
 Japan's Nikkei share average ended down 1.2 percent ,
its lowest close since March 18. 
 Fast Retailing , operator of the Uniqlo clothing
chain, was the biggest drag on the Nikkei, down 2.7 percent,
erasing Friday's gains. Shares of Tokyo Electric Power Co
, operator of the crisis-plagued Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear plant, plunged 25 percent on fears of being delisted. 
 For Japan's stock market, a significant issue is whether
valuations can contract any more than they already have in an
economy waylaid by natural disasters and political
ineffectiveness. Japanese equities were trading at 0.7 times
current book value, Thomson Reuters StarMine showed, the second
cheapest market in the G20. Italy is the only cheaper market. 
 ""What other major global stock markets are undervalued to
this extent?"" said Kenichi Hirano, a strategist at Tachibana
Securities. ""The U.S. market may have entered a correction
phase, but the Tokyo market may not follow suit."" 
 Markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea were
closed for a long holiday weekend, but traders were on watch for
further tightening measures by China's central bank. 
 In commodities markets, U.S. crude futures inched lower but
could resume a climb with the dollar's outlook darkening.	
 The July contract was down 0.2 percent at $100.05 a barrel
.	
Gulf Arab OPEC members led by Saudi Arabia look like they
will push for an increase in supplies on Wednesday in an effort
to support flagging world economic growth by bringing crude
prices back below $100 a barrel. These expectations, however,
have not had much a downward impact on oil prices yet.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street capped off a fifth
straight week of losses on Friday and Treasuries rose as much
slower-than-expected U.S. job growth stoked fear that the
world's largest economy was in a protracted slowdown.
 The euro hit a one-month high against the dollar on news
international aid would be available to Greece as early as
July, while the U.S. jobs data hurt the greenback against the
yen.
 Oil prices traded off their lows after the Institute for
Supply Management said the U.S. services sector staged a modest
recovery last month from April's slump For more, see:
[ID:nN03252131]
 But that was not enough to dispel entirely the unease
stoked by the U.S. Labor Department's monthly report, which
showed the economy added the fewest jobs since September.
 The jobless rate rose to 9.1 percent in May as high energy
prices and the effects of Japan's earthquake bogged down the
economy. [ID:nOAT004818]
 The report ""contributed to a growing list of negative data
reflecting a definitive soft patch in the U.S. economic
recovery,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY
Mellon in New York.
 ""The greater surprise is not that the U.S. slowdown was
unexpected, but rather that it was so pervasive, reflected in
housing, labor, manufacturing and consumer spending data,"" he
added.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Nonfarm payrolls increased by 54,000 last month. the data
showed. Private employment rose by 83,000, the smallest amount
since June, while government payrolls fell by 29,000.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected payrolls to rise
150,000 and private hiring to increase 175,000. The government
revised employment figures for March and April to show 39,000
fewer jobs created than previously estimated.
 Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> closed down 12.78
points, or 0.97 percent, at 1,300.16. For the week, it was
about 2.3 percent lower, marking a fifth straight week of
declines and its worst week since mid-August. The index is down
about 5 percent from its late-April high.
 ""We don't see material downside from here,"" said Jim
McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern
Trust Global Investments, which has $650 billion in assets
under management.
 ""A 5 percent correction (in the S&P) is appropriate for the
slowdown we're experiencing, and over the intermediate term,
our expectation is that we'll regain some momentum,"" he said.
 Unease about the U.S. outlook boosted the benchmark 10-year
U.S. Treasury note  . It rose 11/32 for a yield of
2.99 percent.
 Ten-year yields fell below 3 percent this week for the
first time since December as investors grew anxious about the
economy.
 While some fund managers brooded over the depressing jobs
report, others were looking ahead.
 ""People have come to the conclusion that the economy is in
a slow patch right now, and people are trying to figure out how
temporary this slower growth is -- whether it's actually a
change or a bump in the road for the recovery, and right now
it's a bump in the road,"" said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at
Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois.
 ""Certainly the jobs number wasn't good. The ISM service
number was pretty good,"" added Phil Orlando, chief equity
market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.
 Some wondered whether the Federal Reserve will send more
cheap money their way to extend support given to markets since
the financial crisis.
 ""It doesn't matter what the reality is, it matters what the
perception is, and the perception is that QE3 will at least be
debated again instead of being tossed on the fire,"" said Dennis
Gartman, author of a markets commentary letter.
 The Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program, known in the
market as QE2, is scheduled to end this month. The program has
flooded financial markets with dollars since October, driving
most of the gains in stocks and commodities.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 97.29
points, or 0.79 percent, at 12,151.26. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> closed down 40.53 points, or 1.46 percent, at
2,732.78.
 Global stocks, measured by MSCI's world equity index

(Recasts, updates prices, adds quote)
 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - The dollar sank on Friday and
is likely to drop further in the week ahead after weak U.S.
jobs data added to evidence of a marked economic slowdown.
 The negative sentiment in the United States contrasted
with cautious optimism in the euro zone, with the euro
touching a one-month high on optimism that Greece will receive
its next aid payment and avoid restructuring its debt.
 The single currency surged after the European Union, the
European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund said
the next tranche of international aid for Greece should be
available in July. For details, see [ID:nLDE7520MP]
 Add in a European Central Bank policy meeting, where ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to signal a July
interest-rate hike by using the term ""vigilance"" in reference
to monitoring inflation, and the dollar has little upside.
 ""The next few weeks will see broad choppy ranges,"" said
Gareth Sylvester, senior currency strategist at San
Francisco-based Klarity FX. ""So many questions remain.""
 But with the ECB meeting, interest-rate differentials will
be a key focus and investors, will ""forget about debt
problems,"" Sylvester said.
 The greenback tumbled to an all-time low against the
safe-haven Swiss franc and hit a one-month trough against the
yen. While the greenback remains vulnerable to cheapening on
economic weakness, the euro took out a key resistance level
that could result in further gains.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4641 on trading platform EBS
. It was last trading at $1.4625, up 0.9 percent for
the day.
 The rise above $1.4569 was the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of last month's drop from $1.49404 to $1.39680.
Traders said the breach of that level was a bullish signal and
suggests the euro could rack up further gains to $1.49.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversals last traded at -1.850
on Friday , according to Reuters data, with a
bias toward euro puts and dollar calls, suggesting more
investors are betting the euro will fall than those who
believe it will rise. But that was up from the -2.375 it
traded at just a week ago, suggesting improving sentiment on
the single currency
 DEBT CEILING
 The slowing U.S. economy has complicated the contentious
issue of the U.S. debt ceiling and the need for fiscal
tightening, said Lena Komileva, senior vice president, global
head of G10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in London. She
made the comment in a report.
 ""While there is no question about the market's desire to
fund the U.S. fiscal gap, especially as a slowing recovery
shifts investors' focus back to capital markets and increases
demand for U.S. Treasuries, a worsening outlook for U.S.
public finances will further dent the dollar's relative
advantage as a safe-haven major,"" she said.
 U.S. employers hired far fewer workers than expected in
May and the jobless rate rose to 9.1 percent. Nonfarm payrolls
increased 54,000 last month, the weakest reading since
September, the Labor Department said on Friday.[ID:nOAT004818]
 ""The headline surprise, compounded by downward revisions
and an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate, contributed
to a growing list of negative data reflecting a definitive
soft patch in the U.S. economic recovery,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, managing director at BNY Mellon Global Markets in
New York.
 ""The greater surprise is not the U.S. slowdown was
unexpected, but rather that it was so pervasive -- reflected
in housing, labor, manufacturing and consumer spending data,""
he added.

 The dollar tumbled to its lowest level on record against
the safe-haven Swiss franc . It last traded at 0.8365,
down 0.7 percent.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell to a one-month low 
before recovering slightly to 80.31, down 0.7 percent. The
dollar/yen dropped along with U.S. Treasury yields.
 For the week, the euro gained 2.2 percent against the
dollar , its best week since Jan. 16, while the dollar
lost 0.6 percent against the yen .
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was down 1.4
percent for the week at 73.745.
 Until the dollar index can strengthen above 76.5, any
dollar advance will be limited, Klarity's Sylvester said.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks slid on
Friday and the dollar tumbled after U.S. jobs growth for May
came in way below market expectations, heightening worries that
the world's largest economy is in a protracted slowdown.
 Other stock markets were flat to down slightly.
 However, a report showing encouraging expansion in the U.S.
services sector, one of the few bright spots in a week
inundated with gloomy data, helped trim losses in equity and
commodity markets.
 The euro hit a one-month high against the dollar on news
that international aid would be available for Greece as early
as next month.
 Stock and oil prices traded off their lows after the
Institute for Supply Management noted a modest recovery in the
U.S. services sector in May from April's slump.
[ID:nN03252131]
 The U.S. Labor Department's monthly report showed the
economy adding the smallest number of jobs since September.
 ""The market sold off hard this morning, but it's coming
back a bit,"" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at
Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments, which has
about $650 billion in assets under management. ""I don't think
that's a surprise.""
 ""Certainly the jobs number wasn't good. The ISM service
number was pretty good,"" added Phil Orlando, chief equity
market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.

 The Labor Department said the U.S. jobless rate rose to 9.1
percent in May as high energy prices and the effects of Japan's
earthquake bogged down the economy.
 Closely watched nonfarm payrolls increased 54,000 last
month. Private employment rose 83,000, the smallest amount
since June, while government payrolls dropped 29,000.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected payrolls to rise
150,000 and private hiring to increase 175,000 in May. The
government revised employment figures for March and April to
show 39,000 fewer jobs created than previously estimated.
 Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> was down about 0.4
percent by 1:45 p.m. EDT (1745 GMT), after hitting lows from
mid-April earlier. For the week, it was poised to close about
2.5 percent lower, marking a fifth straight week of declines.
 While some fund managers brooded over the depressing jobs
report, others were looking ahead.
 ""People have come to the conclusion that the economy is in
a slow patch right now, and people are trying to figure out how
temporary this slower growth is -- whether it's actually a
change or a bump in the road for the recovery, and right now
it's a bump in the road,"" said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at
Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois.
 Some wondered whether the Federal Reserve will send more
cheap money their way to extend support given to markets since
the financial crisis.
 ""It doesn't matter what the reality is, it matters what the
perception is, and the perception is that QE3 will at least be
debated again instead of being tossed on the fire,"" said Dennis
Gartman, author of a markets commentary letter.
 The Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program, known in the
market as QE2, is scheduled to end this month. The program had
flooded financial markets with dollars since October, driving
most of the gains in stocks and commodities.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 50.18
points, or 0.41 percent, at 12,198.37. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 5.88 points, or 0.45 percent, at
1,307.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 21.87
points, or 0.79 percent, at 2,751.44.
 Global stocks, measured by MSCI's world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, steadied from early declines. European shares
<.FTEU3> settled down 0.4 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  was down 0.2 percent, returning above
the $100 per barrel level. It fell 2 percent earlier on worries
that any further erosion of the U.S. labor market would hit
consumer spending, reducing fuel demand.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
8/32, its yield at 3.0023 percent.
 Ten-year Treasury yields fell below 3 percent this week for
the first time since December as investors became wary about
the near-term economic outlook.
 The euro surged to a one-month high against the dollar
after the European Union, the European Central Bank and the
International Monetary Fund said the next tranche of
international aid for Greece should be available in July.
 The single currency climbed as high as $1.45530 ,
its strongest since May 6, and last traded at $1.45680, up
nearly 1 percent.

 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Global stocks and oil prices
slid on Friday after U.S. jobs growth for May came in way below
market expectations, heightening worries that the world's
largest economy is in a protracted slowdown.
 However, a report showing encouraging expansion in the U.S.
services sector, one of the few bright spots in a week
inundated with gloomy data, helped to trim losses.
 Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index <.SPX> was down
slightly more than half a percent, after earlier hitting a
six-week low.
 The dollar tumbled against the yen and Swiss franc,
traditionally seen as the currency market's safe havens, after
the government's monthly labor report showed the U.S. economy
adding the smallest number of jobs since September.
 ""This highly disappointing report is a real shocker,"" said
Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pimco, the
largest U.S. bond manager, in Newport Beach. California.
 ""It confirms that America has an unemployment crisis that
involves worrisome economic, political and social dimensions.
It speaks to a large unemployment problem that is becoming
increasingly structural, and therefore protracted, in nature.""
 Global stocks, measured by MSCI's world equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.2 percent. European shares <.FTEU3>
were also down about 0.2 percent, retreating from an earlier
loss of 1 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  was down half a percent, trading just
below the key $100 per barrel level. It fell 2 percent earlier
on worries that any further erosion of the U.S. labor market

 While some fund managers brooded over the depressing jobs

 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Global stocks and oil prices
slid on Friday after U.S. jobs growth for May fell shockingly
below market expectations, heightening worry that the world's
top economy was headed for a protracted slowdown.
 The dollar tumbled against the yen and Swiss franc,

lows -- as goverment data showed the United States added the

 By Jessica Mortimer and Nia Williams
 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-month
high against the dollar on Friday as investors anticipated weak
U.S. jobs data that could signal a protracted soft patch in the
world's biggest economy and weigh further on the U.S. currency.
 However, traders said the euro could struggle to make gains
beyond the one-month high of $1.4518 hit in Asian trade, citing
selling interest around that level, more ahead of an options
barrier at $1.4550 and further offers around $1.4565-70.
 They also said speculative short positions built up in
anticipation of a weak U.S. payrolls number had become extended,
risking a short-covering rally in the dollar.
 ""The risk is for a better number and that we see some
profit-taking (on euro/dollar gains), but people will be looking
to sell into any dollar strength,"" a London-based head of FX
sales said.
 Payrolls expectations were lowered as a report earlier this
week showed sharply slower growth in U.S. private-sector jobs.
 The consensus forecast has gradually dropped to payrolls
growth of 150,000 in May down from 180,000, but traders said
many in the market were expecting an even weaker reading. Credit
Agricole economists slashed their forecast to 80,000.
 Some analysts warned if jobs creation was poor it could
spark risk aversion in financial markets that would cause the
dollar to fall against the yen and safe-haven Swiss franc but
rise versus higher-risk currencies and the euro.
 However, if the data is only slightly below forecasts it may
be seen as a positive against the backdrop of other poor
economic indicators.
 ""The reality is that the market is expecting jobs growth of
around 100-120,000 and a reading of 150,000 could see some
temporary easing of the depression surrounding the recovery
scenario"", said Jeremy Stretch, currency analyst at CIBC.
 The euro was steady at $1.4493 and seen supported by bids at
$1.4455-60 and at $1.4405-10. Stop-loss bids were said to be
lurking near $1.4520, just beyond the earlier high.
 Markets also awaited the conclusions of an EU, IMF and ECB
mission assessing whether Greece has met fiscal targets to deal
with its substantial debt burden. [ID:nLDE7520MP]
 
 DOLLAR/YEN FALLS
 Concerns about a weak U.S. jobs report helped drive the
dollar to a three-week low versus the yen of 80.52 yen on EBS
platform. Dollar/yen has dropped along with U.S. Treasury yields
as U.S. data points to weakness in the economy.
 The dollar was also pressured by Moody's Investors Service
saying on Thursday there was a very small but rising risk of a
short-lived U.S. default if there was no increase in the
statutory debt limit in the coming weeks.
 Concerns over U.S. debt and a weak U.S. economy are likely
to keep the dollar weak. However, the euro may also be hampered
by euro zone debt concerns which would limit euro/dollar gains.
 Chart resistance lies near $1.4570, a 61.8 percent
retracement of its slide in May on worries about possible
restructuring of Greece's debt. Further resistance lies near
$1.4710, a 76.4 percent retracement of that same drop.
 Recent weak U.S. data has stirred market talk of more action
by the Federal Reserve, which is due to end its $600 billion
bond buying programme this month.
 ""This (jobs data) is one number and we have had a bit of a
soft patch globally that may only be related to the Japanese
earthquake and supply chain effect and the high oil price,"" said
Adrian Schmidt, FX strategist at Lloyds.
 ""If the soft patch is maintained through Q2 and Q3 the Fed
could be thinking about another round of quantitative easing in
Q4 but (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke will want to see a quarter of
data after the end of QE2 before making any decisions.""
 The dollar held steady against a basket of major currencies
at 74.321 <.DXY>, having touched a one-month low around 74.210
earlier on Friday.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - European shares and U.S. debt
yields slipped while the euro hovered near one-month highs
against the dollar on Friday before non-farm payrolls data that
could stoke concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
 Oil prices also edged lower as a protracted slowdown in the
the second-biggest energy consumer after China could hit
consumer spending, leading to lower fuel use. Brent crude
futures  fell $1 to $114.52 a barrel.
A raft of grim U.S. data this week has already made
investors wary about the near-term economic outlook and pushed
benchmark 10-year Treasury yields  below 3 percent
for the first time since December.
 Even as investors weigh whether this signals a soft patch or
a prolonged slowdown, markets have begun to come around to the
view that government bonds should benefit in the near term as
inflationary expectations will be contained.
 Brushing aside Thursday's warning from ratings agency
Moody's that the risk of a U.S. debt default was small but
rising, 10-year Treasury debt prices rose, with yields about two
basis points down at 3.013 percent from late U.S. trade on
Thursday.
 ""We've seen some fairly poor economic data recently and this
is why we have these lower rates at the moment. Markets are
bracing for the worst,"" said Rabobank strategist Philip Marey.
 ""If there's an upward surprise (from payrolls) it could have
a strong upward impact on yields ... 
 ""But I wonder how much lower they can go if it's a downward
surprise, because markets are positioned for lower figures (than
consensus). They could maybe reach 2.95 (percent) if there's
another disappointment in the data.""
 German government bonds diverged from Treasuries, with the
10-year Bund yield up 3.5 bps at 3.019 percent as euro zone
officials appeared close to agreeing a second bailout for
debt-laden Greece, though losses could be capped by the U.S.
jobs report.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and the chair of euro
zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, are expected to
meet mid-afternoon to discuss fresh austerity measures. Markets
are also awaiting the conclusions of an EU, IMF and ECB mission
assessing whether the country has met fiscal targets.
 Anticipating a U.S. weak jobs reading at 1230 GMT, analysts
have cut their forecasts on non-farm payrolls growth to 150,000
from 180,000, according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nN01187478]

 DOLLAR WEAKNESS
 A weak number may weigh further on the dollar but traders
said the euro could struggle to make gains much beyond its
earlier one-month high of $1.4518, citing offers around that
high and more ahead of an options barrier at $1.4550.
 The euro was steady on the day at $1.4490.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar held steady at
74.33 <.DXY>, having hit a one-month low of 74.209 earlier on
Friday with market players increasingly wary of a pullback.
 ""The data is likely to continue to point at a soft patch in
the U.S. economy and could lead to a risk-off scenario that
would imply dollar weakness against the Swiss franc and yen and
strengthening against the Aussie, Canadian dollar and sterling,""
said Jeremy Stretch, currency analyst at CIBC.
 ""The reality is that the market is expecting jobs growth of
around 100-120,000 and a reading of 150,000 could see some
temporary easing of the depression surrounding the recovery
scenario"".
 A weak reading on payrolls could further dent demand for
risky assets as the Federal Reserve prepares to wind up its $600
billion bond purchase programme this month and U.S. policymakers
appear reluctant to offer more support to the ailing economy.
 U.S. stock futures point to a lower open on Wall Street,
with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , Standard & Poor's
500  and Nasdaq composite  seen down around 0.3
percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 0.4
percent, after shedding 1.3 percent in the previous session to
its lowest close in six weeks, as the U.S. economic recovery
looked shakier. World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>
were 0.1 percent lower.
 Credit Suisse strategists say the end of the asset-buying
programme could be ""a tactical headwind for trades that have
benefited from extremely low real rates and now have expensive
valuation"".
 Those trades are high leverage stocks, high dividend yield
stocks, U.S. equities, gold  and short U.S. dollar <.DXY>,
they say in a note.
 Spot gold was last bid at $1.525.44 a troy ounce from
$1,532.55 late on Thursday in New York, with traders saying a
poor jobs figure could see it pushing back towards the record
high of $1,575.79 it hit on May 2.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, June 3 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-month high
against the dollar on Friday, with investors fretting whether
U.S. jobs data due later in the day might signal a protracted
soft patch in the U.S. economy's recovery and a further slide
in the dollar.
 Disappointing U.S. data spurred a drop in the 10-year U.S.
Treasury yield to a six-month low earlier in the week and
dragged the dollar down to a one-month trough versus a basket
of major currencies.
 With market expectations already lowered after a report
this week showed sharply slower growth in private-sector jobs
last month, market players say the chances of a steep dollar
sell-off after the U.S. jobs data on Friday do not seem very
high.
 ""Unless there is a truly extreme result, I don't think the
market will get all excited about the chances for QE3 and
further dollar weakness,"" said Makoto Noji, a senior bond and
currency strategist for SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 150,000 in May,
according to a Reuters poll, less than the 180,000 forecast
before Wednesday's report on slower private job growth.
[ID:nN0118747]
 ""Comments by policymakers will probably become a bigger
focal point, whether they view the slowdown seen in
manufacturing surveys and drop-off in employment as being
temporary, or start making comments that justify accommodative
(monetary) policies,"" Noji said.
 The recent string of weak U.S. data has stirred market talk
of more action by the Federal Reserve, which is due to end its
$600 billion bond buying programme this month.
 However, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, one of the
Fed's most strident inflation hawks, told the Wall Street
Journal that the Fed has done enough to spur economic growth
and new steps to boost the economy would be unwarranted.
[ID:nL3E7H3016]
 EURO RESISTANCE NEAR $1.4570, $1.4710
 The euro held steady at $1.4484 , clinging to gains
made after Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday there is
a very small but rising risk of a short-lived default by the
United States if there is no increase in the statutory debt
limit in the coming weeks. [ID:nN02274698] [ID:nNWNA0100]
 Earlier on Friday it hit a one-month high of $1.4518 on
trading platform EBS as traders tried to trigger stop-loss bids
said to be lurking near $1.4520.
 On the euro's downside, there was talk of euro bids at
levels near $1.4440 to $1.4450.
 Chart resistance for the euro lies near $1.4570, a 61.8
percent retracement of its slide in May on worries about
possible restructuring of Greece's debt.
 Further resistance lies near $1.4710, a 76.4 percent
retracement of that same drop.
 U.S. Treasuries fell on Thursday after the Moody's warning,
but traders said the bulk of the selling was driven by
profit-taking after a rally on Wednesday, and currency analysts
played down the significance of the Moody's warning as a
selling factor for the dollar. [ID:nN02288941]
 Noji at SMBC Nikko Securities said market players expect
congressional leaders to reach a deal by early August.
 ""I think the consensus is that there will be a decision on
a broad stance to reduce the debt over the medium to long term.
I don't think the market will get caught up in full-blown
worries about the status of U.S. Treasuries as a safe-haven
asset,"" Noji said.
 The dollar held steady against a basket of major currencies
at 74.345 <.DXY> <=USD>, having touched a one-month low around
74.210 earlier on Friday.
 Against the yen, the dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 80.71 yen
. The dollar has support near 80.59 yen, a 61.8 percent
retracement of its rally in May, and also at the previous day's
low of 80.55 yen.
 Below that area, a 76.4 percent retracement of the same
rally offers support near 80.20 yen.

 * Asia stocks ex-Japan set for first weekly gain in six
weeks
 * Curve flattener trades in focus
 * JP Morgan bond index yields better returns this quarter

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, June 3 (Reuters) - Stocks steadied, bond yields
dipped and the euro rose to a one-month high versus the dollar
on Friday as investors braced for a key U.S. jobs report that
could feed debate over whether the economy is headed for a
protracted slowdown.	
 A raft of grim U.S. data this week has already made
investors wary about the near-term economic outlook and pushed
10-year treasury yields below 3 percent for the
first time since December this week.	
 Even as investors weigh whether this signals a soft patch or
a prolonged slowdown, markets have begun to come around to the
view that this should boost government bonds in the near term as
inflationary expectations will be contained.	
 Brushing aside Thursday's warning from ratings agency
Moody's that the risk of a U.S. debt default was small but
rising, 10-year Treasuries rose, with yields dipping 1.7 basis
points to 3.015 percent from late U.S. trade on Thursday.
[ID:nN02274698]	
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said the popular
trade in global bond markets appeared to be putting on curve
flatteners as markets expect softer growth and more moderate
inflationary pressures.	
 Anticipating a weak jobs reading later on Friday, analysts
have already cut their forecasts on non-farm payrolls growth to
150,000 from 180,000 previously, according to a Reuters
poll.[ID:nN01187478]	
 The spread between 10-year notes and two-year bills, a proxy
for the curve, has narrowed to about 256 basis points, compared
to nearly 290 basis points in early February.	
 The bullish outlook on bonds rippled over into Asian
markets, with local currency bonds enjoying a good run so far
this quarter on hopes that aggressive policy tightening in the
region may be coming to a close.	
 Measured in dollar-adjusted terms, total returns for the
broader JP Morgan GBI-EM Asian index are 1.44 percent so far
this quarter, compared to less than 1 percent in the March
quarter. Foreigners have bought nearly five trillion yen ($62
billion) worth of JGBs in the past six consecutive weeks of net
buying.	
 ""Tighter monetary policy is still likely, because policy
rates are still low relative to current and average historical
underlying inflation rates, but if headline inflation rates
stabilize, the amount of tightening that we are likely to see in
the coming months is mostly priced into bonds,"" DBS said.	
 
 STOCKS STEADY	
 Still, a weak reading on payrolls could further dent demand
for risky assets at a time when the end of the Federal Reserve's
$600 billion bond purchase programme is in sight and U.S.
policymakers appear reluctant to offer more support to the
ailing economy.	
 Japan's Nikkei share index fell 0.5
percent after losing 1.7 percent on Thursday, with political
uncertainty continuing to weigh on sentiment, though cheap
valuations and options-related short covering may provide some
support.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside
Japan was broadly steady with industrial and
financial stocks leading gains.	
 Stocks have had a mixed week as PMI data on Wednesday showed
factory growth slowed in major Asian countries thanks to
tightening credit conditions and a severe drought in parts of
China, though some bargain hunting meant markets were set to
post their first weekly gain in six weeks. Similar reports
showed slowdowns in manufacturing growth in Europe and the
United States.	
 But in a sign that valuations are getting attractive again,
the MSCI Asia ex-Japan forward 12-month earnings currently is at
11.8 compared to an average of around 12.8 this decade while
forecasts for earnings growth have steadily risen over the past
6 months, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
 Fund flow data also paint a brighter picture. EPFR
Global-tracked funds showed Asia-ex-Japan equity funds were the
only major emerging markets fund group to post inflows in the
last week of May. 
 Moody's threat of a U.S. ratings downgrade along with
reports that Greece had agreed to new deficit-cutting measures
took the wind out of the dollar's strong run, with the euro
hitting a one-month high against the dollar.	
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar held steady
against a basket of major currencies at 74.318 , having
touched a one-month low of 74.209 earlier on Friday with market
players increasingly wary of a pull back.	
 ""Unless there is a truly extreme result, I don't
think the market will get all excited about the chances for QE3
and further dollar weakness,"" said Makoto Noji, senior bond and
currency strategist for SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo,
referring to any fresh round of asset buying by the Federal
Reserve.	
 Moody's warnings revived safe-haven demand for gold ,
with prices holding around the $1534 per ounce line. Brent
 crude for July delivery edged higher to around
the$115.54 a barrel line.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Worries about the pace of the
U.S. economic recovery weighed on equities on Thursday, a day
ahead of the U.S. government's closely watched payrolls report,
while the euro rallied on news of a financial lifeline for
Greece.
 The news of progress on a new debt plan for Greece helped
Wall Street shares pare earlier losses, but with the latest
U.S. data intensifying fears that the economy could be
stalling, investors were reluctant to make bets before Friday's
critical labor market report on May is released.
 A defensive stance ahead of the payrolls report also pulled
down U.S. Treasuries prices. Government debt was further hurt
after Moody's Investors Service said the United States risked a
credit ratings downgrade if its legal borrowing limit is not
raised.
 The euro hit a one-month high above $1.45 on news that
senior euro-zone officials had agreed in principle to a new
three-year adjustment plan for Greece to pay off its mountain
of debt. [ID:nATH006131]
 The U.S. government's jobs report for May is expected to
show job growth has slowed again after picking up in April.
 ""If you think the risks are rising, then you have got to
take some money off the table just from a risk-reward
perspective, and that's what we've done,"" said Bruce Bittles,
chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird & Co in
Nashville.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 41.59 points,
or 0.34 percent, to 12,248.55. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> dipped 1.61 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,312.94. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 4.12 points, or 0.15
percent, to close at 2,773.31.
 Education stocks rallied on heavy volume after U.S.
officials relaxed rules that could have cut off tuition aid to
programs run by for-profit colleges. DeVry Inc  and
Apollo Group Inc  were the top two gainers in the S&P
consumer discretionary sector. DeVry shot up 14.6 percent to
$61.86, while Apollo surged 11.1 percent to $46.87.
[ID:nL3E7H21RM]
 The Labor Department said on Thursday that first-time
claims for jobless benefits in the latest week fell by 6,000 to
422,000. The figure was below expectations for a decline to
415,000. [ID:nN02246578]
 The government is expected to report on Friday that
employers hired 150,000 workers in May, according to a Reuters
survey, after increasing payrolls by 244,000 in April.
 ""Every indication we have had so far points to a slightly
softer labor market in the U.S.,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Copper, a key industrial metal, closed down half a percent
in New York  after hitting a one-week low during the
session as the weak U.S. labor data heightened concerns about
the world's biggest economy.
 Weakness in the economy was further underscored by a
report from the Commerce Department showing new orders received
by U.S. factories fell 1.2 percent in April after rising 3.8
percent in March. [ID:nN02253767]
 With the U.S. Federal Reserve set to wrap up its $600
billion bond buying program later this month, signals of more
economic weakness ahead are especially worrying to investors
involved in riskier assets such as equities, high-yield bonds
and emerging markets.
 The MSCI index of global equities fell 1.01 percent
<.MIWD00000PUS>. European shares <.FTEU3> fell to a one-week
closing low as the U.S. data raised concerns about the pace of
recovery.
 In addition to the news on Greece, the euro was boosted
after Moody's Investors Service said there is a very small but
rising risk of a short-lived default by the United States if
there is no increase in the statutory debt limit in coming
weeks.
 The euro  was last up 1.2 percent at $1.44971,
having risen as high as $1.4515 on trading platform EBS.
 ""The euro is rallying as comfort over a near-term outcome
for Greece improves and the market refocuses on problems in the
U.S. economy,"" said Sutton. ""A key psychological level is
$1.45. The euro and dollar are in an ugly dog contest and the
euro is winning right now.""
 In the U.S. Treasuries market, the warning from Moody's
accelerated losses spurred by unease ahead of the U.S. payrolls
report. The 10-year Treasury note  was last down
26/32 in price and yielding near 3.04 percent, up from 2.95
percent at Wednesday's close. The 30-year bond  lost
1-23/32 in price to yield 4.25 percent, up from 4.15 percent.
 The weaker dollar helped push up oil prices.
 U.S. crude oil  edged up 0.1 percent to settle at
$100.40 per barrel. Brent crude in London  finished up
1.2 percent at $115.87 per barrel.
 Oil fell earlier in the day after data showing a surprise
jump in U.S. crude stockpiles and talk that OPEC production
might have to go up to cool high prices, which economists said
could hurt global growth.

 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - The euro touched a one-month
high against the dollar on Thursday after Moody's Investors
Service said there is a very small but rising risk of a
short-lived default by the United States if there is no
increase in the statutory debt limit in coming weeks.
 In a statement, Moody's said if there is no progress in
increasing the debt limit, it would expect to place the Aaa
sovereign credit rating on review for a possible downgrade. For
details, see [ID:nN02274698]
 The euro had already extended gains against the dollar,
helped by a Reuters report that euro zone officials had agreed
in principle on a new three-year adjustment program for Greece
that would involve increased external funding. [ID:nATH006131]
 That followed earlier reports that Greece had agreed to new
deficit cutting measures, allaying fears over its debt crisis
and causing investors to shift focus to the U.S. economy.
 ""Moody's threat to downgrade U.S. debt certainly doesn't
help the dollar,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency
research at GFT Forex in New York. ""Moody's downgrade adds
pressure on congressional leaders to work hard at reaching an
agreement to increase the debt ceiling.""
 But Lien added that Moody's is still lagging behind S&P in
their rating actions and threats.
 ""Putting a country's rating on review is also not the same
as a downgrade,"" she said. ""An actual downgrade is still an
unlikely scenario.""
 The euro  was last up 1.2 percent at $1.44971,
having risen as high as $1.4515 on electronic trading platform
EBS.
 ""The euro is rallying as comfort over a near-term outcome

 DISAPPOINTING DATA
 A recent spate of disappointing U.S. data, ranging from the
factory sector to the labor market, has darkened the U.S.
economy's outlook and made the dollar less appealing than
higher-yielding currencies.
 The data coincides with worries about the end of the Fed's
second round of quantitative easing later this month. Known as
QE2, the $600 billion asset purchase program was launched to
stimulate the economy. Investors fear its removal could hinder
recovery.
 The U.S. Labor Department's non-farm payrolls report on
Friday is a key monthly driver of financial markets. Payrolls
likely increased by 150,000 in May, according to a Reuters
poll. [ID:nW1E7GN022]
 New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell by 6,000
last week to a seasonally adjusted 422,000. [ID:nOAT004815]

400,000, which is certainly a negative,"" said Scotia's Sutton.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - World stocks and oil slumped
for a second straight day on Thursday as the latest U.S.
economic data kept investors on the edge, with a slight drop in
claims for jobless benefits not enough to assuage fears about
the economy's path.
 The dollar fell to a one-month low against the euro as
Greece agreed to new measures to cut its deficit, mitigating
fears over its debt crisis and making investors shift their
focus to the U.S. economy.
 On Wall Street, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index
<.SPX> fell below its May low as investors reacted to the data
on jobless claims. First-time claims for jobless benefits in
the latest week fell by 6,000 to 422,000. The figure was below

 ""Every indication we have had so far points to a slightly
softer labor market in the U.S.,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Nervous investors honed in on key market levels to manage
risk a day after stocks suffered their worst one-day fall in
nearly a year.
 Appetite for risk-taking had been on the decline since late
May due to lackluster data from both emerging and developed
economies.
 ""We've been through a couple week period here where
basically every piece of economic data has just been awful,""
said John Canally, investment strategist and economist for LP
Financial in Boston.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 78.29
points, or 0.64 percent, at 12,211.85. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 6.28 points, or 0.48 percent, at
1,308.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 4.25
points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,764.94.
 DOLLAR, OIL DOWN; BONDS EASE
 With the U.S. Federal Reserve set to wrap up its $600
billion bond buying program later this month, signals of more
economic weakness ahead are especially worrying to investors
involved in riskier assets such as equities, high-yield bonds
and emerging markets.
 The MSCI index of global equities fell 1.01 percent
<.MIWD00000PUS>.
 European shares fell to a one-week closing low as the U.S.
data raised concerns about the pace of recovery in the world's
biggest economy.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
provisionally finished 1.2 percent lower at 1,117.09 points --
the lowest close since May 23.
 The euro jumped 1 percent against the dollar to a one-month
high  on optimism that European officials will reach an
agreement on how to help Greece repay its debt.
 The growth unease has seen investors pile into safe-haven
U.S. and German bonds, with U.S. 10-year yields falling under 3
percent on Wednesday for the first time since last December.
 Treasuries dipped slightly as investors cashed in on recent
gains, pushing up the benchmark 10-year yield  3.1
basis points. But the yield stayed under 3 percent and is
unlikely to rise much in the current environment.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street was poised to open
higher on Thursday and rebound from the sharp losses of the
previous session after a drop in U.S. weekly claims for jobless
benefits, which also boosted oil prices.
 World stocks extended losses and the dollar fell to a
one-month low against major currencies after dismal data on
Wednesday had pointed to a faltering recovery in the United
States.
 The fears of an economic malaise were mitigated somewhat by
the latest weekly unemployment claims, which fell to 422,000
from the previous week's 428,000. [ID:nLLA2HE7GL]
 ""I think what's important is, with the exception of the
retailing entities, most of the economy is actually doing quite
well as a business profit standpoint, and that may provide some
shock absorber to this,"" said Michael Strauss, chief economist
at the Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut.
 ""We're shifting what would have been some economic growth
in the second quarter to the third quarter.""
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher opening for Wall
Street a day after the biggest one-day fall in almost 10 months
for the benchmark S&P 500 index <.SPX>.
 U.S. Treasuries dipped slightly but yields stayed near
six-month lows hit on Wednesday.
 Crude oil in New York held steady at just above $100 a
barrel after declining 1 percent earlier.
 Even so, some investors were expected to be sidelined ahead
of key U.S. jobs data for May due on Friday. Appetite for
risk-taking had been on the decline this week after lacklustre
data from both emerging and developed economies.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a one-month high
against the weak dollar on Thursday, boosted by expectations of
a quick-fix solution to the Greek debt crisis, although gains
could be checked by investors selling into the bounce.
 The euro was also helped by strong demand at a Spanish bond
auction, comments by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet [ID:nL9E7FB01O], and the struggling dollar, which fell
to a one-month low against a basket of currencies .
 A senior government official told Reuters that Greece has
agreed to 6.4 billion euros in new steps to cut its 2011 budget
deficit and aims to wrap up bailout talks with international
inspectors by Friday. [ID:nLDE7510BM].
 The ""troika"" team from the European Union, International
Monetary Fund and European Central Bank has been in Athens since
early May, negotiating on two main points -- whether the
government has qualified for a fifth slice of funding under the
existing 110 billion euro rescue deal, and the sustainability of
Greeece's 340 billion euro debt burden.
 ""Whatever the ""troika"" agrees to will provide a short term
relief rally to the euro,"" said Lena Komileva, global head of
G-10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 ""The $1.45 level for the euro remains key and I believe any
rally by the euro could see a sell-off as systemic risks in the
euro zone will still be there. Any short-term solution (for)
Greece is just kicking the can down the the road.""
 The euro  was last 1.1 percent higher on the day at
$1.4467, having risen as high as $1.4487 on trading platform
EBS. Traders said a major Asian sovereign account was a seller
around the highs with further stops highlighted on a break of
$1.4500, while option barriers rolling off this month are
layered up to $1.4700.
<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Reuters Insider show on euro technicals
 http://link.reuters.com/keg89r
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 The euro clawed back ground even after Moody's cut its
credit rating for Greece deep into junk territory. It also
gained over 1 percent against the Swiss franc , rising
as high as 1.2191 francs and pulling away from its record low of
1.2053 francs struck earlier on Thursday.
 
 DOLLAR UNDER PRESSURE
 But the U.S. dollar was under pressure against the
safe-haven Swiss franc, shedding 0.2 percent and trading not far
from its record low of 0.8383 , struck on Wednesday.
 The dollar fell after data on Wednesday showed U.S.
companies hired far fewer workers than expected in May and that
output in the manufacturing sector slowed to its lowest since
2009. [ID:nN01147563]
 Analysts said a poor U.S. nonfarm payrolls number on Friday
could trigger more dollar losses and fuel speculation about the
need for more monetary stimulus measures after a second round of
quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve ends this month.
 ""We're in a stage where the dollar will be soft if people
become concerned about weak U.S. data, as QE3 could become a
by-product of that,"" said RBS currency strategist Ankita Dudani.
 ""We'll get a better grip on how the economy is doing after
the nonfarm payrolls,"" she said, adding that another round of
quantitative easing was unlikely as she expected the U.S.
economy to pick up in the second half of 2011.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down 0.4 percent at 74.376,
having fallen to a one-month low of 74.29.
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 80.81 yen . The yen
inched up a touch after Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan on
Thursday survived a no-confidence vote, but traders said overall
reaction to the vote was limited. [ID:nPOLJP]
 Sebastien Galy, senior currency strategist at Societe
Generale, said a fall in U.S. yields was also a negative factor
for the dollar, after the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield
hit a six-month low below 3.0 percent  on Wednesday.
 Along with a recent cut in speculator bets to sell the
dollar, he argued that more signals pointed to dollar selling.
 ""Positioning is no longer heavily short dollars, and so with
bad U.S. data lowering growth prospects and flattening the yield
curve, the dollar comes under pressure across the board.""

 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - World stocks extended losses on
Thursday and the dollar fell to a one-month low against major
currencies after a run of dismal economic data pointed to a
faltering recovery in the United States.
 Equities pared some early losses, however, as U.S. stock
futures pointed to a higher opening for Wall Street a day after
the biggest one-day fall in almost 10 months for the benchmark
S&P 500 index <.SPX>. U.S. Treasuries too dipped slightly but
yields stayed near six-month lows hit on Wednesday.
 Investors are likely to keep to the sidelines ahead of key
U.S. jobs data due on Friday but their appetite for risk-taking
has already been hit by lacklustre data from both emerging and
developed economies.
 U.S. data on Wednesday showed private sector job creation
was way below forecasts in April, while factory growth worldwide
has been slowing, surveys showed earlier.
 ""The outlook is darkening. It must be worrying for the
global economic authorities. It has cost about $10 trillion
worldwide to create the impression of an economic revival and we
have nothing to show for it,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr,
strategist at Charles Stanley.
 He was referring to the enormous amounts of cash stimulus
central banks around the world pumped into their economies to
boost growth after the 2008 financial crisis.
 With the U.S. Federal Reserve set to wrap up its $600
billion bond buying programme later this month, signals of more
economic weakness ahead are especially worrying for riskier
assets such as equities, high-yield bonds and emerging markets.
 By 1055 GMT, the MSCI index of global equities had fallen
0.6 percent <.MIWD00000PUS>, slightly trimming earlier losses.
The index fell 1.2 percent on Wednesday, exacerbated by a 2.3
percent tumble in the S&P 500.
 Emerging equities shed 1 percent <.MSCIEF>.
 European stocks also fell. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top European shares was down 0.7 percent, after a one
percent tumble on Wednesday.
 Mining and energy firms were hardest hit as investors
fretted that global commodity demand would weaken. Stocks such
as Antofagasta  and Xstrata  fell between 2.4
percent and 2.8 percent 
 Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> and
France's CAC40 <.FCHI> fell between 1 and 1.3 percent.
 Earlier, Japanese shares fell 1.7 percent <.N225>, hit also
by the political backdrop as Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he
would resign once he gets the nuclear crisis that followed
March's devastating earthquake and tsunami under control.
 China closed 1.4 percent down at a four-month low <.SSEC>.
 Markets may get some respite from New York however, as U.S.
stock futures inched higher. 
 Futures for the S&P 500  and Dow Jones  rose 0.3
percent while Nasdaq 100  futures were up 0.45 percent.
Investors are awaiting more U.S. jobs and factory data at 1230
GMT as well as details of sales at chain stores last month.
 
 DOLLAR, BONDS EASE; OIL IN BOUNCE
 U.S. non-farm payrolls data, seen as the best barometer of
the world's largest economy, will offer direction to markets on
Friday, with analysts slashing their estimates for job creation.
 The median forecast of U.S. payrolls growth in May in a
Reuters poll was revised down to 150,000 from the prior forecast
of 180,000 after Wednesday's poor jobs data [ID:nN01187478].
 A weak number will increase pressure on the U.S. dollar,
which fell to a one-month low versus a basket of currencies
<.DXY> and hovered near a record low to the Swiss franc 
 Analysts say disappointing nonfarm payrolls data will fuel
speculation about the need for more monetary stimulus after the
Fed's second quantitative easing round (QE2) ends in June.
 ""We're in a stage where the dollar will be soft if people
become concerned about weak U.S. data, as QE3 could become a
by-product of that,"" said Ankita Dudani, currency strategist at
RBS in London.
 The euro jumped 1 percent against the dollar to a one-month
high  on optimism that European officials will reach an
agreement on how to help Greece repay its debt.
 The growth unease has seen investors pile into safe-haven
U.S. and German bonds, with U.S. 10-year yields falling under 3
percent on Wednesday for the first time since last December. 
 On Thursday, Treasuries dipped slightly as investors cashed
in on recent gains, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield
 3.1 basis points higher. But it stayed under 3
percent and is unlikely to rise much in the current environment.
 German Bunds too retreated from four-month highs hit after a
strong Spanish bond sale showed some peripheral euro zone states
are riding out the current bout of market stress.
 The sale came a day after a three-notch downgrade for Greece
from Moody's, relegating it deep into junk territory.
 ""We've probably seen the peak (in Bunds) for today. People
have been playing the Greek story and buying bunds on negative
news but how much more bad news can you get from Greece?"" said
Charles Berry, a trader at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
 On commodity markets, metals extended losses, with copper, a
key component in power and construction, hitting a weekly low
before recovering slightly.
 But Brent oil bounced 60 cents to $115.3 a barrel and U.S.
futures gained 17 cents, rising above $100. A weak greenback
makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for buyers holding other
currencies.
Growth fears are likely to cap crude gains, however. Doubts
about the U.S. recovery have deepened after data last week
showed a 3.5 million-barrel jump in U.S. crude stockpiles,
according to an American Petroleum Industry report.
 More inventory data is due at 1500 GMT.
 Traders are also pricing in the possibility of an output
rise next week by the OPEC group of oil producing nations.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, June 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid on Thursday,
with a steady stream of weak U.S. data putting a damper on risk
taking ahead of Friday's payrolls report, though valuations will
probably in the near term limit a big decline in global share
prices.	
 Readings of economies around the world from China to the
United States have been for the most part undershooting
forecasts, raising questions about how well risky assets such as
stocks and high yield bonds will hold up once the Federal
Reserve's $600 billion bond buying programme ends this month.	
 Even as big banks such as Citi and Goldman cut their
payrolls growth forecasts though, the equity market sell off has
been tame compared with previous bouts of so-called ""risk
aversion"" in global markets. 
 Furthermore, valuations of global equities on the basis of
12-month earnings forecasts are already running below their
long-term average and below where they were the last time a
protracted period of risk reduction caused a rout in share
prices more than a year ago.	
 Those factors may limit a further sell-off in equities based
on fears of a U.S. economic soft patch. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 1.7 percent , a
smaller decline compared with the 2.3 percent tumble in the S&P
500 U.S. stocks index overnight. 
 Political uncertainty also loomed over Tokyo and weighed on
stocks, after Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who faced a
no-confidence vote in parliament, said he would resign after
getting a nuclear crisis and other disaster-related matters
under control. [ID:nL3E7H200W]	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was down
2.2 percent , with selling heaviest in the
materials, financial and technology sectors. Utilities and
telecommunications stocks -- traditionally segments of the
market where investors stash their money in times of volatility
-- outperformed.	
 
 EQUITY VALUATIONS BELOW AVERAGE	
 Japanese stocks are valued at one time their current book
value, Thomson Reuters StarMine data showed, cheaper than Irish
and Portuguese shares. However, the market cap of companies
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is the third-highest in the
world. 
 ""U.S. shares needed a correction of their recent steep
gains. Japanese shares will be capped for now but cheap
valuations will give the market support,"" said Ryota Sakagami,
strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. 
 The MSCI all-country world stocks index is
running at a 12-months forward earnings multiple of 11.7 times,
lower than the 12.4 times average of the past two years and
below the 13.5 times valuation they had when the escalating
European debt crisis triggered a selloff in risky assets in
April/May of 2010, according to I/B/E/S data. 
 
 GREECE CONFUSION STALLS EURO GAINS	
 The euro's march above $1.44 on Wednesday was halted after
Moody's cut its sovereign rating on Greece by three notches as
Athens struggles to avert a debt default.	
 The single currency was trading at $1.4360 on Thursday, up
0.3 percent due mostly to the slipping U.S. dollar. 
""Looking at the recent data I don't think anyone is really
expecting Friday's U.S. employment data to be strong. Investors
have already tried to price in possible low figures on Friday,
selling the dollar,"" said Sumino Kamei, a senior currency
analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo. 
 The median forecast of U.S. payrolls growth in May in a
Reuters poll was revised down to 150,000 from the prior forecast
of 180,000 after a report on Wednesday reflected weak private
sector employment activity. [ID:nN01187478]	
 The euro though risked backtracking further to its Monday
low around $1.4250 if headlines on Greece suggest a new round of
financing is in jeopardy.	
 At times contradicting headlines on prospects for Greece's
near-term financing has made the euro zig zag, though hopes for
Greece were kindled after European Central Bank Executive Board
member Juergen Stark was quoted as saying the ECB might accept a
rollover of Greek debt by private investors. [ID:nLDE750337] 
 Elsewhere in currency markets, the Australia dollar edged up
after stronger-than-expected Australian retail sales, though
remained in a range carved out last month and later was
unchanged on the day at $1.0615 . 
 The Australian dollar is considered by market participants
to be a weather vane of investor tolerance for risk because of
its relatively high yield and close economic relationship with
China.	
 U.S. 10-year Treasury futures  were steady after
hitting a high for the year on Wednesday.	
 A sudden spill in U.S. stocks sent investors scurrying to
the liquidity of the U.S. government bond market and sent the
benchmark cash 10-year yield below 3 percent .	
 The 10-year note was retracing some of its overnight climb
in early Thursday trade, bringing the yield back up a bit to
2.97 percent. A mix of selling in shorter maturity paper by
speculators and mutual funds and central bank buying of longer
dated debt made the yield curve its flattest of the year on
Wednesday, Royal Bank of Scotland strategists said in a note.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Investors stampeded out of
stocks and into bonds on Wednesday as dismal U.S. economic data
led the S&P 500 to its worst day in 10 months and benchmark
Treasury yields fell below 3.0 percent the first time since
December.
 U.S. private employers hired far fewer workers than
expected in May and manufacturing slowed to its lowest level
since 2009, bolstering concerns that the U.S. recovery was
running out of steam.
 ""The sugar high that has buoyed the U.S. economy over the
past six months is wearing out, and there is little in economic
growth or foundation to show for it,"" said Douglas Borthwick, a
managing director with Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury debt, the
favorite asset of investors looking for a safe place to store
cash in tough times, hit December lows, hovering around 2.95
percent.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> index, like other major
Wall Street indices, fell more than 2 percent, its biggest drop
since August 11.
 Crude oil prices in New York  and London  also
dropped more than 2 percent, the most since May 12.
 Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector slowed sharply in
May, with the Institute for Supply Management's index of
national factory activity falling to its lowest level since
September 2009. For more, see: [ID:nOSL016366]
 That followed a report from payrolls processor ADP
Employment Services that showed poorer job growth in the
private sector than expected, leading many Wall Street banks to
slash forecasts for Friday's non-farm payrolls figure from the
government.
 ADP's report showed employers added a scant 38,000 jobs,
nearly four times below that expected by the market.
 The U.S. Labor Department will release its payroll numbers
for May on Friday. A Reuters poll on Wednesday put payrolls at
150,000 versus an earlier forecast of 180,000.
 FOCUS SHARPENS ON FRIDAY JOB NUMBERS
 Some analysts, like David Lutz at Stifel Nicolaus Capital
Markets in Baltimore, said traders were talking about a
""whisper number"" of about 100,000 new jobs in May.
 ""If we have a payrolls number with revisions that is
anything like the ADP on Friday, then we are going to struggle
over the next couple of months,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief
investment officer at Wells Capital Management.
 Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey
City, New Jersey, concurred: ""It's not just about jobs. It's
about manufacturing, it's about real estate, it's about
consumer confidence. This is one data point in a very broad
picture, and it's not encouraging.""

 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Investors fled U.S. stock
markets on Wednesday and poured into Treasuries after dismal
U.S. economic data, driving benchmark yields to below 3.0
percent for the first time since December.
 The dollar initially fell to a four-week low versus the
euro as the employment and manufacturing reports for May
suggested U.S. growth was slowing more quickly than first
thought. The greenback rebounded on profit-taking in the euro,
joining currency safe-havens such as the yen and Swiss franc.
 Oil prices   fell as much as 2 percent, while
gold , often a safe haven, rose nearly 1.0 percent.
 ""The sugar high that has buoyed the U.S. economy over the
past six months is wearing out, and there is little in economic
growth or foundation to show for it,"" said Douglas Borthwick, a
managing director with Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury debt, the
favorite asset of investors looking for a safe place to store
cash in tough times, hit December lows, hovering at around 2.96
percent.
 Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector slowed sharply in
May, with the Institute for Supply Management's index of
national factory activity falling to 53.5 in May, its lowest
level since September 2009. For more, see: [ID:nOSL016366]
 That followed a report from payrolls processor ADP
Employment Services that showed poorer job growth in the
private sector than expected, leading many Wall Street banks to
slash forecasts for Friday's non-farm payrolls figure from the
government.
 ADP's report showed employers added a scant 38,000 jobs,
nearly four times below that expected by the market.
 The U.S. Labor Department will release its payroll numbers
for May on Friday. A Reuters poll on Wednesday put payrolls at
150,000 versus an earlier forecast of 180,000.
 NEXT FOCUS ON FRIDAY JOB NUMBERS
 Some analysts, like David Lutz at Stifel Nicolaus Capital
Markets in Baltimore, said some traders were talking about a
""whisper number"" of about 100,000 new jobs in May,
 ""If we have a payrolls number with revisions that is
anything like the ADP on Friday, then we are going to struggle
over the next couple of months,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief
investment officer at Wells Capital Management.
 Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey
City, New Jersey, concurred: ""It's not just about jobs. It's
about manufacturing, it's about real estate, it's about
consumer confidence. This is one data point in a very broad
picture, and it's not encouraging.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 231.29

(Updates prices, details)
 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - The dollar skidded to an
all-time low against the Swiss franc on Wednesday and struggled
against the euro after poor manufacturing and employment data
stoked expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain low
for longer than markets have expected.
 Optimism that Greece will avoid restructuring its massive
debt load initially supported the euro, driving it to a
four-week high against dollar, though it surrendered gains as
investors found nothing concrete to drive it higher.
 A private sector report on Wednesday showed U.S. private
employers added only 38,000 jobs in May, while separate data
showed output in the manufacturing sector slowed to its lowest
level since 2009. For details, see [ID:nEAPA10DLO]
[ID:nN01229306]
 ""Economic indicators continue to show the economy is
re-entering a downward spiral,"" said Douglas Borthwick,
managing director at Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""Beginning with housing numbers, joined by local
manufacturing data and now today with employment numbers, we
believe the U.S. economy is hitting the brakes at exactly the
wrong time for the Federal Reserve,"" he said. ""The USD has no
choice but to weaken given exports are the only bright spot in
the U.S.""
 The dollar fell against the franc to record low of 0.8383
 and was last down 1.4 percent at 0.84168 francs.
 The European Central Bank raised rates in early April and
several more increases are expected this year to combat
inflation. Rate differentials are a primary reason for the
euro's 7.5 percent gain against the dollar this year.
 Wednesday's private payrolls data hints at a weak U.S.
Labor Department nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, a key
monthly driver of financial markets given jobs growth is one of
the Federal Reserve's two mandates.
 The Swiss franc benefited from its safe-haven appeal and
from upbeat readings on the Swiss manufacturing and retail
sectors.
 The euro also hit a record trough versus the Swiss currency
at 1.2085 . It last traded at 1.2110, down 1.5
percent.
 Against the yen, which also benefited from its safe-haven
appeal, the dollar was down 0.8 percent at 80.90 yen .

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> 
 The euro first rose on Wednesday as Greece neared a deal
with the European Union and International Monetary Fund on
Wednesday to avert a near-term default but later fell as the
New York session wound down.
 The single-currency hit a four-week high of $1.4459
 on electronic platform EBS but then fell as low as
$1.4368.
 In mid afternoon New York trade, the euro was little
changed at $1.4386. A UK trader said there was protective
selling ahead of $1.44550 barriers, with more sell orders
toward $1.4480 ahead of huge barrier option at around $1.4500.
 Sources close to talks between Athens and inspectors from
the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF said
they expected the latest review of Greece's fiscal progress to
be completed by Friday. [ID:nLDE750201]
 A source told Reuters on Wednesday that whether Athens gets
the fifth, 12 billion euro tranche of aid under its 110 billion
euro EU/IMF bailout will depend on a meeting of senior EU
finance officials under way in Vienna and also on a meeting of
euro zone finance ministers to be held soon. [ID:nLDE7500HM]
 The euro was dented after German newspaper Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung said it is now considered certain that the
IMF will not pay its share of a fifth tranche of aid to Greece
at the end of June. It did not cite any sources.
[ID:nB4E7G900F]
 ""A deal for Greece would be a temporary stopgap that pushes
the day of reckoning further down the road,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency strategist at BTM-UFJ. ""We think the euro is
overvalued given the weak fundamentals in the euro zone and
believe levels above $1.45 will be aggressively sold into,"" he
added.

 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Investors fled from the U.S.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - World stocks held near three-week
highs on Wednesday while the euro touched a close to one-month
peak as investors hoped for concrete progress on a fresh bailout
deal for Greece that would ease fears of an immediate default.
 Surveys showing factory growth eased in Europe and Asia
introduced a note of caution before the Federal Reserve
completes its $600 billion bond-buying programme (QE2) later
this month.
 European finance officials are meeting in Vienna later to
work out a solution to a looming funding shortage for Greece.
 The prospect of an aid deal and reports the EU, IMF and ECB
will conclude talks on a medium-term fiscal plan for Greece this
week boosted risky assets, but uncertainty remained on whether
private sector debt holders would participate in helping ease
the burden. [ID:nLDE7500HM]
 ""I fear this will be a temporary relief. Of course clarity
and more money is helpful in the short run, but this doesn't
solve the long-term problems,"" said Niels From, chief analyst at
Nordea in Copenhagen.
The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was steady on
the day. The benchmark index ended May with a loss of 2.5
percent, reducing year-to-date gains to just over 5 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was down 0.1 percent
while emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> rose a quarter of a percent.
U.S. stock futures were down 0.1 percent , pointing to a
weaker start on Wall Street later.
 ""With the QE2 package due to expire at the end of the month,
there's no shortage of uncertainty as to what happens when the
easy money disappears,"" said Cameron Peacock, market analyst at
IG Markets.
 Given the euro zone debt crisis and a soft patch in economic
data, investors reduced their exposure to stocks in May for the
fourth month in a row, Reuters polls showed.
 At their most pessimistic since the third quarter of 2010,
they moved into bonds and cash, according to the surveys.
[nLDE74U16O]
 U.S. crude oil  slipped 0.1 percent to $102.56 a
barrel on Wednesday, but losses were limited due to disruptions
to oil supplies to top consumer the United States and a
political upheaval in Yemen.
 Bund futures  were down 53 ticks.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro was volatile on
Wednesday, hitting a fresh four-week high against the dollar,
although fresh doubts about whether Greece will receive aid from
the IMF and a key chart resistance levels could check gains.
 The euro  fell sharply to $1.4390 after German
newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said it is now
considered certain that the IMF will not pay its share of a
fifth tranche of aid to Greece at the end of June. It did not
cite any sources. [ID:nB4E7G900F]
 But the common currency recouped those losses to trade at
$1.4438 , up 0.3 percent for the day. It rose to a
four-week high of $1.4448 on trading platform EBS in the
European session, with traders citing option barriers at
$1.4450.
 Near-term resistance level looms at $1.4454, a 50 percent
retracement of a slide from its early May peak above $1.4940 to
a two-month trough of $1.3968 hit last week.
 ""The German news report was seen as negative initially but
the market does not seem to be putting much weight on it since
it is still not clear whether the IMF will stop the next tranche
or not,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency strategist at Credit
Agricole.
 ""As a result the euro's regained those losses, but the
speculative community remains wary of going long having burnt
their hands last month. So, in the near term the euro could rise
to as high as $1.46 before easing back.""
 Earlier in the session, the euro had been boosted by a
report in Greek newspaper Kathimerini which said details of the
Greek government's mid-term fiscal plan were expected to be
finalised by Wednesday night or Thursday morning, traders said.
 Analysts also said the euro was buoyed by data on Tuesday
showing euro zone inflation still well above the European
Central Bank's 2 percent target, reinforcing expectations of a
hike in euro zone interest rates, although inflation rose more
slowly than expected in May. [ID:nBRLVGE7ET]
 The euro was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 117.60 yen
, having touched a high of 117.80 yen on Tuesday, its
highest since early May.
 It jumped 1.5 percent against the yen on Tuesday, buoyed by
a Wall Street Journal report saying Germany was considering
dropping its push for an early rescheduling of Greek bonds in
order to facilitate a new package of aid loans for Greece.
 
 DOLLAR UNDER PRESSURE
 While the euro remained hostage to speculation about whether
a rescue package for Greece would be stitched together in time,
sporadic selling of the dollar by Japanese exporters helped to
lend support to the yen on Wednesday morning.
 Exporters have been spotted offloading their dollar
positions as some manage to resolve supply chain problems
stemming from the March 11 earthquake sooner than expected,
traders said.
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent against the yen to 81.42
yen. . One trader said there were some stop-loss dollar
offers near 80.50 yen, but no noticeable stop-loss dollar offers
above that.
 The dollar stayed under pressure, extending losses after a

hovering near a three-week low.

 * Euro volatile amid conflicting reports on aid deal	
 * European stocks steady, Asian edge higher	
 * Manufacturing data confirms global factory growth slowing	
 
 SINGAPORE, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro traded at a four-week
high versus the dollar on Wednesday, buoyed by hopes for a fresh
bailout package for debt-laden Greece, while Asian stocks edged
higher after manufacturing data from China was largely in line
with expectations.	
 European stocks were steady in early trade as investors
awaited key U.S. jobs data for further clues on the health of
the world's biggest economy, which has seen a spate of weak data
in recent weeks.	
 Earlier in the day, the euro was knocked by a report in
German newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung which said
the IMF will not pay its share of an aid tranche to Greece at
the end of June, a market move which showed the currency's
extreme sensitivity to any new Greek rescue plan. 
 But the single currency later rebounded to $1.4448,
boosted in part by a report in Greek newspaper Kathimerini that
the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European
Central Bank are expected to finalise a second financial aid
package for Greece in the coming days. [ID:nLDE75007B]	
 If a deal is signed soon, it could give the euro impetus to
climb, traders said.	
 ""Our view is that Greece will get another package - perhaps
with some token 'voluntary' lengthening of maturities but not
significant enough to really damage private investors - and so
the euro should rebound over the coming few weeks,"" said Rob
Ryan, a FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore.	
 The dollar was hobbled by more weak U.S. economic data on
Tuesday, dipping 0.1 percent against the yen to 81.26 yen and
easing 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies .	
 Japan's Nikkei share index closed 0.3 percent higher
despite a bout of early profit-taking following Tuesday's boost
from positive industrial and manufacturing activity data. Asian
stocks outside of Japan rose 0.4 percent, led by
by resources shares as oil and metal prices rebounded overnight.	
 With debt problems in peripheral euro zone countries
deepening and signs of a slowdown in the global economy,
investors reduced their exposure to stocks in May for the fourth
month in a row, Reuters polls showed. At their most pessimistic
since the third quarter of 2010, investors moved out of shares
and into bonds and cash, according to the surveys.
[ID:nLDE74U16O]	
 Year-to-date gains in world stocks, measured by MSCI
, have shrunk to around 5 percent from nearly 9
percent earlier this year, and a key question for markets is
whether investors exit more risky positions before the end of
the Federal Reserve's $600 billion Treasury purchase programme
(QE2) in June.	
 ""Investors now see a slowdown in goods production as
virtually guaranteeing a soft patch for overall US economic
growth,"" Societe Generale said in a research note, suggesting
weakness will linger in the United States. 
 
 Markets were largely unfazed by surveys showing Chinese
factory growth is slowing under the weight of government credit
curbs and power shortages, echoing reports from Europe and the
United States showing those economies are growing more sluggish.	
 Chinese factory growth slowed to at least nine-month lows in
May as the rate of new orders cooled off, two PMI surveys showed
on Wednesday.	
 Though the easing was in line with market expectations, and
manufacturing activity continued to expand, the softening in
orders could flag further economic weakness ahead and weaker
demand for riskier assets such as equities and commodities.
[ID:nL3E7H103M]	
 Gold fell around $3 to $1,532.90 per ounce by 0725
GMT. Gold, one of the chief beneficiaries of investors move to
safe-havens in times of extreme volatility, set a record high of
$1,575.79 per ounce in early May.	
 Brent crude oil for July delivery  was up 5 cents at
$116.78 a barrel, having recovered from its fall below $115
earlier this week.

 NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a
three-week high against the dollar, global stocks powered ahead
and crude oil rose on Tuesday on expectations that a second
financial aid package would be approved for Greece.
 On Wall Street, shares rose more than 1 percent on a late
rally, after paring gains earlier following disappointing data
on U.S. consumer confidence business confidence in the U.S.
Midwest.
 European stocks hit a 2-1/2-week closing high, led by
banking stocks, with Greek banks <.FTATBNK> up 10.1 percent as
the euro rose.
 The weaker dollar helped lift commodities, driving up oil 2
percent in New York, its biggest gain in nearly two weeks,
while copper closed at four-week highs in London.
 European officials met in Vienna to sketch out options for
a second bailout package for Greece, with private sector
participation still under discussion to help relieve the
country of its heavy debt burden.
 Germany is considering dropping its push for an early
rescheduling of Greek bonds in order to facilitate a new
package of aid loans for Greece, The Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter
[ID:nL3E7GU21K].
 ""More aid for Greece does not solve the problem, but it
does buy time and limit contagion risk into Ireland, another
country with funding requirements in 2012,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 The euro  rose as high as $1.4424 to the dollar,
according to electronic trading platform EBS.
 Even then, there were doubts the gains could be sustained.
 ""I would fade this rally in the euro for now,"" said
Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi. ""Investors will
be looking for a more lasting resolution to the Greek debt
problems and our economists haven't ruled out the possibility
of a voluntary restructuring involving private bondholders.""
 On Wall Street, the optimism on aid for Greece drove
sentiment, overshadowing another round of weaker-than-expected
U.S. economic data.
 The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of
consumer attitudes fell in May to 60.8 from a revised 66.0 in
April [ID:nN9E7G401Y], and the Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago's index of Midwest business activity dropped
11 points in May from April.
 The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago's index of
Midwest business activity fell in May to 56.6 from 67.6 in
April.
 U.S. single-family home prices also dropped in March to
below 2009 levels, according to the S&P/Case Shiller composite
index of 20 metropolitan areas, which cited heavy inventory and
weak demand. [ID:nN31287627]
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 127.68 points, or 1.03 percent, at 12,569.26. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 14.08 points, or 1.06 percent,
at 1,345.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 38.44
points, or 1.37 percent, at 2,835.30.
 But the grim economic data suggested more hurdles ahead as
the S&P closed out its worst month in 10.
 ""Today is a good day, but the fact that the Dow gave up its
early gains and is going to close lower for the month isn't
positive,"" said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at
National Securities in New York. ""There's a conflict between
the economic reports coming in lower than expected and the hope
for resolution out of Greece.""
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,141.24 points.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
just over 1 percent, while its emerging market index <.MSCIEF>
gained 1.7 percent.

member of parliament told business newspaper Handelsblatt that
Greece should leave the euro zone. [ID:nN31117008]
[ID:nB4E7G600C]
 May marked the euro's worst month since November, with the
single currency weighed down by fears that a new aid package
would only provide temporary relief for Greece rather than the
intensive surgery required for the country's financial
ailments.
 The dollar <.DXY> was down nearly half a percent against a
basket of currencies.
 Assets seen as risky gained.
 Oil prices closed up more than $2 per barrel, at above $102
per barrel in New York  and above $116 in London
.
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange 
closed at $9,220 a tonne from a close of $9,199 on Friday. It
earlier hit $9,278.50, its highest since May 4.
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> of 19 commodities
gained 1 percent on the day. A rally in oil toward the end of
May limited the index's monthly loss to about 6 percent, from
an earlier 10 percent.
 U.S. government debt initially fell on the stronger euro
and appetite for risk but rebounded after the worrisome U.S.
economic data. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 was up 3/32 in price to yield at 3.05 percent.

 NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro hit three-week highs
on Tuesday on hopes for a Greek bailout after suffering its
worst month since November, while oil prices also rallied.
 The dollar extended its losses against the euro from last
week on expectations that a second financial aid package would
be approved for Greece. A sharp drop in U.S. consumer
confidence in May and a weak reading of business confidence in
the U.S. Midwest also hit the greenback.
 The stronger euro and weaker dollar boosted prices of
commodities, with crude oil rising more than 1.5 percent and
copper hitting four-week highs in London. [ID:n31290526]
 U.S. stocks opened strongly, reacting to the stronger euro
and better confidence over Greece, but gave back much of their
gains on the disappointing U.S. consumer and business
confidence data.

either taking profits or taking a wait-and-see attitude,"" said

 NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro touched a three-week
high against the dollar on Tuesday on the belief that Greece
may avoid a debt restructuring, but further gains are likely to
be capped by technical resistance after a weak monthly
performance.
 While the euro rallied last week on bets that Greece should
be able to shoulder its heavy debt burden without
restructuring, the currency shared by 17 nations is still down
around 2.9 percent in May, its worst monthly performance since
November.
 The euro  had earlier risen to $1.44245 according
to electronic trading platform EBS.
 It was buoyed by news that Germany is considering dropping
its push for an early rescheduling of Greek bonds in order to
facilitate a new package of aid loans for Greece, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the
matter. For details, see [ID:nL3E7GU21K]
 The report came as Europe stepped up efforts to draft
another bailout package for Greece, and Eurogroup leader
Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday expressed optimism that a new
package was coming together. [ID:nL3E7GV07I]
 The euro did pare gains against the dollar after a German
Parliament member told business newspaper Handelsblatt that

 In mid afternoon New York trading, the euro was up 0.7
percent at $1.4376, below resistance at $1.4454, the 50-percent
retracement of this month's fall from nearly $1.50. Above that
lay the 61.8 percent retracement of the same move at $1.4568.
""More aid for Greece does not solve the problem, but it does

 This week's U.S. economic data will culminate with Friday's
nonfarm payrolls report for May.
 Woolfolk said having failed to get any traction below the
1.40 level, players are expected to retest the EUR/USD's upside
this week, barring any material surprises.
 ""The negative correlation between the Dow and the dollar
remains in place, with commodity and equity prices buoyant,"" he
said.
 Data on Tuesday showed euro zone inflation rose more slowly

 ""Given the data, the ECB is likely to maintain its hawkish

 An ECB rate rise would widen the euro's rate advantage
against the dollar, particularly given that the Federal Reserve
is widely expected to keep its lending rate near zero for
months to come.

 NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a
three-week high against the dollar, global stocks advanced and
crude oil rose on Tuesday on expectations that a second
financial aid package would be approved for Greece.
 Weakness in the dollar, which was hurt following data that
showed U.S. consumer confidence fell sharply in May and a weak
reading for business confidence in the U.S. Midwest, helped
support prices for oil and other commodities. Crude rose more
than 1.5 percent, while copper hit a four-week
high.[ID:n31290526]

on Wall Street, while in Europe banking stocks led gains, with

 ""More aid for Greece does not solve the problem, but it
does buy time and limit contagion risk into Ireland, another
country with funding requirements in 2012,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
The euro  rose as high as $1.4424 to the dollar,
according to electronic trading platform EBS.
 But even as the euro strengthened on Tuesday, there were
doubts that gains could be sustained.
 ""I would fade this rally in the euro for now,"" said
Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi. ""Investors will
be looking for a more lasting resolution to the Greek debt
problems and our economists haven't ruled out the possibility
of a voluntary restructuring involving private bondholders.""
 On Wall Street, the optimism on aid for Greece drove
sentiment, overshadowing another round of weaker-than-expected
U.S. economic data.

consumer attitudes fell to 60.8 from a revised 66.0 in April.

 By Neal Armstrong and Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week high
against the dollar on Tuesday after a report said Germany could
make concessions on efforts to put together a bailout for
Greece, helping to ease fears over a Greek debt restructuring.
 The single currency rose to $1.4425 according to electronic
trading platform EBS, but further gains were capped by offers
seen above that level, while technical resistance loomed around
$1.4450.
 Germany is considering dropping its push for an early
rescheduling of Greek bonds in order to facilitate a new package
of aid loans for Greece, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people familiar with the matter. [ID:nL3E7GU21K]
 The report comes as Europe has stepped up efforts to draft
another bailout package for Greece, and Eurogroup leader
Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday expressed optimism that a new
package was coming together. [ID:nL3E7GV07I]
 ""There's quite a big risk premium in the euro based on Greek
default concerns, so if Germany lends more money to get them
through to 2013, the chances of a disorderly restructuring
further down the line become much reduced,"" said Adrian Schmidt,
currency analyst at Lloyds Banking Group.
 The report triggered demand for higher-risk, higher-yielding
currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars,
which both rose sharply against the low-yielding yen.
 By 1120 GMT, the euro hovered around $1.44, below resistance
at $1.4454, the 50 percent retracement of this month's fall from
nearly $1.50. Above that lay the 61.8 percent retracement of the
same move at $1.4568.
 The dollar fell more than 0.5 percent against a currency
basket to 74.439 <.DXY> <=USD>, as the euro's rally and better
sentiment towards riskier assets pushed it to a three-week low.
 The dollar was flat against the Swiss franc at 0.8520 francs
, hovering near a record low of 0.8457 hit on Monday.
 The New Zealand dollar jumped 1 percent to $0.8264 ,
a fresh post-float high. [ID:nL3E7GU1YW]
 Despite the dollar's broad losses, it rose roughly 1 percent
on the day to around 81.78 yen  as the yen took a broad
hit after Moody's said it had placed its rating on Japan under
review for a possible downgrade, less than a week after rival
rating agency Fitch cut its outlook on Japan's debt.

 EURO UPSIDE CAPPED
 Some analysts were sceptical about the sustainability of the
euro's rise as they believe a Greek debt restructuring is
inevitable, and that more aid loans would only throw new debt
onto old debt without solving Athen's fiscal problems.
 ""I would fade this rally in the euro for now. Investors will
be looking for a more lasting resolution to the Greek debt
problems and our economists haven't ruled out the possibility of
a voluntary restructuring involving private bondholders,"" said
Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi.
 Renewed concerns about Greece's debts have pushed the euro
around 2.5 percent lower versus the dollar so far this month,
cutting overstretched long euro positions.
 While euro positioning remains long, it is more balanced
than a month ago, and UBS currency analyst Geoffrey Yu said
recent, choppy trade illustrated the deep division between euro
bulls and bears while euro valuation remains relatively high.
 ""Real money is still not convinced that Greece will be able
to last the next few months, so there's a struggle between
people who want to buy the euro on dips and people who are
trying to grab any opportunity to get out of the euro,"" he said.
 But given the market's obsession with monetary policy and
rate differentials between currencies, Yu said the euro may
initially rise to $1.45 if the European Central Bank next month
signals that it is preparing to raise interest rates again.
 Data on Tuesday showed euro zone inflation rose more slowly
than expected in May but remained well above the European
Central Bank's 2 percent target. [ID:nBRLVGE7ET]
 An ECB rate rise would widen the euro's rate advantage
against the dollar, particularly given that the Federal Reserve
is widely expected to keep its lending rate near zero for months
to come.
 Signs of weakness in the U.S. economy have raised
speculation that U.S. rates will stay low. Investors will look
to U.S. data on home prices, regional manufacturing and consumer
confidence later on Tuesday to better gauge the economy's
health.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a three-week
high against the dollar on Tuesday, while world stocks and oil
prices advanced on a report that Germany could make concessions
to facilitate a new aid package for Greece.
 Berlin, which along with some other countries had resisted
extra funding, is considering dropping its push for an early
rescheduling of Greek bonds, the Wall Street Journal said.
[ID:nL3E7GV07I]
 That was in line with the tone of comments by Berlin's
finance minister last week, although other substantial barriers
appear to remain to the provision of extra financial help to
deal with Greece's financing needs next year.
 Worries over the euro zone debt crisis have driven the euro
sharply lower this month and it is on course for its first
monthly loss since November.
 ""There's quite a big risk premium in euro based on Greek
default concerns, so if Germany lends more money to get them
through to 2013, the chances of a disorderly restructuring
further down the line become much reduced,"" Adrian Schmidt,
currency analyst at Lloyds Banking Group, said.
 Concerns have intensified after Greece fell short of
deficit-reduction goals and the IMF this month pointed to
problems with the release of the next tranche of aid, raising
the risk of a default on Athens' 327 billion euros of debt.
 The euro  was up 0.9 percent at $1.4406 after hitting
a three-week high at $1.44245, and up 0.7 percent at 1.2251
Swiss francs . The single currency is down about 2.6
percent overall on the month, according to Reuters data.
 Greece's shares <.ATG> climbed 3.8 percent, while the
Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Index <.TRXFLDPIPU> rose 2.5
percent and the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> of leading European
shares added 1 percent.
 Yields on 10-year Greek government bonds  fell
38.6 basis points to 16.352 percent, while their Spanish peers
 yielded 4 basis points less at 5.357 percent.
 The yield on Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund 
rose 6.8 basis points as safe-haven demand eased, to top the key
psychological level of 3 percent.
 Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire said it was likely that
any softening of Germany's stance on a ""reprofiling"" of Greek
bonds will prove to be a short-term development designed to
avoid the immediate funding crunch that would arise if the IMF
were to stop its disbursements. 
 ""With bailout fatigue also increasingly evident on the part
of core electorates, this issue is likely to make a return near
term and could perhaps feature at the Eurogroup's discussions on
Greece on 20 June,"" he said in a note.
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default fell, with
the country's five-year credit default swaps down 43 basis
points at 1,400 bps, according to data monitor Markit.
 
 WEAK MAY PERFORMANCE
 U.S. stock index futures    rose 0.9 to
1.1 percent, indicating a firm opening on Wall Street.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.9 percent, though the index was on
track to register its biggest monthly percentage losses since
last August.
 Credit Suisse said in note that it is too early to upgrade
equities as a number of green lights are still missing for it to
turn tactically positive on the asset class.
 ""Previous mid-cycle corrections have lasted four months and
on average have been 12 percent. Globally, markets are down 4
percent since our tactical downgrade (to neutral) on February
17,"" it said.
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> rose 2 percent,
encouraged by predictions of strong industrial output in the
coming months, though it ended the month 1.6 percent lower.
 Brent crude  advanced 1.5 percent to trade above $116
a barrel, though it was down 7.6 percent this month, heading to
its worst monthly percentage loss in a year.
 Crude prices are still up more than 22 percent this year on
supply concerns driven largely by unrest in oil-rich Middle East
and North Africa.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a three-week
peak against the dollar on Tuesday after a wave of
short-covering triggered by a report saying Germany could make
concessions on efforts to put together a bailout for Greece,
with traders eyeing $1.45 as its next target.
 Germany is considering dropping its push for an early
rescheduling of Greek bonds in order to facilitate a new
package of aid loans for Greece, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
[ID:nL3E7GU21K]
 ""The euro zone problems appear to be subsiding for now. Or
putting it another way, the market appears to have stopped
looking at them as a factor for now,"" said Teppei Ino, a
currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding that
the market could now focus on the heavy schedule for U.S. data
releases this week.
 The euro rose as high as $1.4407 , its highest in
three weeks, piercing its 55-day moving average of $1.4334 and
also $1.4373, the top of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart.
 ""The euro has gone through all the stop-loss levels I heard
about this morning. It is very strong on the charts, and it's
bouncing back now having hit a double-bottom of $1.4048 on May
16 and $1.3968 on May 2
 3,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 ""It also breached resistance at the top of the Ichimoku
cloud, and the nearest resistance is seen at $1.45,"" said the
trader adding that the level has become crucial after the euro
moved around it in mid-April.
 The European Union is racing to draft a second bailout
package for Greece to release vital loans next month and avert
the risk of it defaulting, EU officials said on Monday.
[ID:nLDE74T0LG]
 Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of euro zone finance
ministers, said he was optimistic after discussing further aid
for Athens with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris.
 Moves to plug a looming funding gap for 2012 and 2013
accelerated after the International Monetary Fund said last
week it will withhold the next tranche of aid due on June 29
unless the EU guarantees to meet Athens' funding needs for next
year.
 DOLLAR DIPS
 The dollar's index against a basket of currencies fell to
its lowest level in three weeks, losing 0.5 percent to 74.568
<.DXY> <=USD>, having broken below support on the Ichimoku
cloud bottom at 74.89.
 The dollar has been hurt by a recent batch of disappointing
U.S. data, with many traders thinking that important numbers
this week, such as ISM manufacturing and payroll data, could
cement the view that the U.S. recovery may remain slow for now.
 ""The dollar came under pressure ahead of U.S. jobs data
and manufacturing figures due this week. Macro funds are
offloading positions in the dollar as they expect slightly
weaker figures after a bout of weak data earlier this month,""
said Koji Fukaya, chief currency analyst at Credit Suisse in
Tokyo.
 The dollar also fell 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.85 franc , a stone's throw from a record low of 0.8457
hit on Monday while the pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.6543
, its highest in four weeks.
 The Australian dollar also gained 0.23 percent to $1.0713
, quickly recovering from small losses posted after
weaker-than-expected Australian export data.
 The New Zealand dollar did even better, jumping 1.0 percent
to as high as $0.8264 , a fresh post-float high
[ID:nL3E7GU1YW].
 The yen failed to benefit from overall dollar weakness,
slipping after Moody's said it had placed its rating on Japan
under review for possible downgrade, less than a week after
rival rating firm Fitch cut its outlook on Japan's debt.
 The dollar gained 0.36 percent to 81.23 yen  while
the euro jumped more than 1.3 percent to 116.88 yen, its
highest since May 20.
 The euro moved from near its support at its 100-day moving
average at 115.32 yen to 116.77 yen, zeroing in on immediate
resistance at its 55-day moving average at 117.43 yen. The yen
also dropped 0.8 percent against sterling .

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - The euro eased on Monday, pulling
away from a key chart resistance as uncertainty over how
Greece's debt crisis will be tackled kept investors on edge,
while the dollar stabilized following a slide late last week.
 With volumes low due to holidays in the UK and the United
States, analysts expected the euro to stay below its 55-day
moving average of $1.4325.
 The single currency, which was last down 0.4 percent at
$1.4263 , also faces resistance near $1.4369, the top of
the cloud on the daily Ichimoku chart, a technical analysis tool
popular among traders. Stops are said to be lurking above
$1.4350 with light bids seen below $1.42, traders said.
 ""The market is a bit hesitant about picking up the euro and
taking it past the mid-May highs of $1.4345 given uncertainty
about whether Greece will receive its next (aid) tranche from
the IMF/EU and whether it can fulfill all the requirements,""
said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea.
 ""There is a bit of tug-of-war going on between the euro and
the dollar with (recent) softer-than-expected U.S. data hurting
the dollar.""
 Greek government bond yields rose and spreads over German
Bunds widened after European Central Bank board member Lorenzo
Bini Smaghi warned of the dangers if Greece were to default on
its debt. He told the Financial Times it was a ""fairytale"" to
think that Greece's debts could be restructured in an orderly
way. [ID:nLDE74S0K3]
 Over the weekend German weekly magazine Der Spiegel fanned
fears that Greece might not receive the next tranche of its
EU/IMF bailout, saying Athens might have missed all fiscal
targets set by its lenders. 
 Greece and the IMF denied the report and EU officials said
they were working on a second bailout package that will avert a
potential Greek default. [ID:nLDE74T0LG]
European Union and IMF officials are expected to deliver
their progress report on Greece's debt sustainability probably
late this week. As that will signal whether Athens gets the next
tranche of its bailout, euro bulls are likely to stay on the
sidelines given the uncertainty. If Greece fails to get funds,
it faces the possibility of default over the summer.
 
 SPECULATORS CUT LONG EURO POSITIONS
 Latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed speculators drastically reduced net long
positions in the euro in the week to May 24. [IMM/FX]
 Still, speculators were carrying a small net long position,
which meant some are expecting a rise rather than a fall in the
euro/dollar. That was in contrast to mid-2010 when the euro zone
debt crisis led to a jump in bearish euro bets.
 ""With more neutral positioning in the market, risk has
become more symmetrical,"" Danske Markets said in a note. ""Should
the June ECB meeting bring focus back to relative rates there
should thus be room for renewed positioning building and hence
renewed upside in the euro/dollar.""
 While worries about the risk of a debt restructuring by
Greece cast a cloud over the euro, a recent run of weak U.S.
economic data and a drop in U.S. Treasury yields were weighing
on the dollar, traders said.
 Earlier on Monday, the dollar hit a record low against the
Swiss franc of 0.8457 francs  on trading platform EBS and
dipped to a 26-year trough versus the New Zealand dollar
. The dollar index <.DXY> was flat at 74.997, not far
from a two-week low of 74.752.
 ""Data in the U.S. is showing growth is losing momentum and
that has supported speculation of another round of quantitative
easing,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS. ""For
the dollar to turn around there has to be a change in interest
rate expectations in the U.S. That's unlikely in the near term.""
 The two-year U.S. Treasury yield dipped to as low as 0.48
percent  on Friday, the lowest since early December.
Data in the U.S. picks up this week, with the May jobs report on
Friday the highlight.
 The dollar was steady against the Japanese yen at 80.87 yen
, but has retreated since hitting a three-week peak of
82.23 yen earlier in May.
 The Canadian dollar  was little changed against the
U.S. currency as Canadian first-quarter growth data offered few
surprises. [ID:nN30202447] The U.S. dollar was last up 0.2
percent at C$0.9775, recovering from a low of C$0.9752.

 SINGAPORE, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week high
versus the dollar on Tuesday on a report that Germany could make
concessions on efforts to put together a bailout for Greece,
while Japanese shares rose on data suggesting industrial
activity has begun to recover from a March earthquake.	
 The euro rose to $1.4407 , its highest in three weeks,
supported by a Wall Street Journal report that Germany was
considering dropping its demand for an early rescheduling of
Greek bonds in order to facilitate a new package of aid loans
for heavily-indebted Greece. [ID:nL3E7GU21K]	
 European shares were expected to open higher, with financial
spreadbetters calling Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX
and France's CAC-40 to open up 0.7-0.8 percent.	
 The European Union wants to draft a second bailout package
for Greece to release vital loans next month and avert the risk
of the euro zone country defaulting.	
 Trader said the euro's next upside target was $1.45.	
 ""The euro zone problems appear to be subsiding for now. Or
putting it another way, the market appears to have stopped
looking at them as a factor for now,"" said Teppei Ino, a
currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding the
market could focus on upcoming U.S. data releases. Key numbers
including ISM manufacturing and payroll data are due this week.	
 China's official purchasing managers' index for May is
scheduled for release on Wednesday, and is expected to weaken
slightly from April. A surprisingly big fall could prompt
investors to sell riskier assets, a reflex
reaction.[ID:nL3E7GR0LK]	
 
 In Japan, the Nikkei average rose 1.8 percent to
9677.28, boosted by industrial output figures.	
 Though an output increase of 1 percent in April was below
expectations, manufacturers sharply increased their forecasts
for May, predicting output would rise 8.0 percent compared with
the previous 2.7 percent forecast, data from the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry showed. [ID:nL3E7GU0JC]	
 Companies expect the recovery to continue in June, a sign
they are making progress in recovering from the March
earthquake.	
 ""Investors got past the weak data in April and cheered the
strong outlook by buying futures,"" said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an
equity strategist at Mizuho Securities.	
 Big gainers on the Nikkei included solar power firms,
expected to win business as a result of Germany's decision to
shut all its nuclear reactors by 2022, a switch in policy
prompted by the Fukushima radiation scare in Japan.
[ID:nLDE74T0GY] 
 Panel-maker Sharp Corp rose 2.5 percent to 759 yen
and panel equipment manufacturer Ulvac was also up 2.5
percent to 2,065 yen.	
 MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside
Japan was up 1.3 percent.	
 The yen slipped marginally to around 81 per dollar
from 80.70 after credit rating agency Moody's said it had placed
it rating of Japan on review for a possible downgrade.	
 Brent crude oil for July delivery  rose 55 cents to
$115.23 a barrel, having slipped below $115 on Monday, when
markets were closed in the United States and Britain. Prices are
down around 9 percent in May, the biggest drop since May last
year.

after closing at $1,597.95 on Monday in trade drastically
thinned by market holidays in the United States and Britain.

security of currencies and other assets, set a record high of
$1,575.79 per ounce in early May.

 LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday,
running into key chart resistance as uncertainty over how
Greece's debt crisis will be tackled kept investors on edge,
while the dollar stabilised following a slide late last week.
 With trade expected to be lacklustre due to a holiday in

 ""The main difference is likely to be that the ECB is not
going along with the politicians,"" Commerzbank said in a note.
""Should the IMF really refuse to continue its aid package
...this would constitute a further negative signal and would
have an effect on the euro. While the ECB sticks to its position
the consequences for the euro will remain limited, though.""
 
 DOLLAR INDEX OFF TWO-WEEK LOWS
 While worries about the risk of a debt restructuring by
Greece continue to cast a cloud over the euro, a recent run of
weak U.S. economic data and a drop in U.S. Treasury yields were
weighing on the dollar, market players said.
 Earlier on Monday, the dollar hit a record low against the
Swiss franc of 0.8457 francs  on EBS and dipped to a
26-year trough versus the New Zealand dollar .
 The dollar index <.DXY> was flat at 74.935, pulling away
from a two-week low of 74.752 on short covering.
 ""I get the sense that it all hinges on yields. The dollar
tends to come under pressure when the market is in risk-on mode
and also when U.S. yields are falling,"" said Koji Fukaya,
director of global foreign exchange research at Credit Suisse
Securities in Tokyo.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury yield dipped to as low as 0.48
percent  on Friday, the lowest since early December.
 The euro's yield advantage over the dollar based on U.S. and
German two-year government bond yields has narrowed in May. But
the current level of about 109 basis points is still not far
from a peak near 133 basis points hit in early May.
 In a sign of the recent weakness of the greenback, the New
Zealand dollar hit a 26-year high of $0.8218  on Monday,
the kiwi's loftiest level since it was floated in March 1985.
The New Zealand dollar later trimmed its gains and last stood at
$0.8167 , down 0.2 percent on the day.
 The dollar held steady at 80.84 yen , and has
retreated since hitting a three-week peak of 82.232 yen earlier
in May.
 Market players said the yen has attracted demand from Asian
investors. Foreign investors have flocked to Japanese government
bonds in the past five weeks, finance ministry data shows, and
market sources say China was among the main buyers.,

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 30 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a
two-week low against a basket of currencies on Monday and Asian
stocks were pinned in tight trading ranges as weak U.S. economic
data and fears of a Greek debt default kept many investors on
the sidelines. 
 European stocks were also set to dip, tracking weakness in
Asia, but trading was expected to be thin with holidays in the
United States and the UK. 
 European Union and IMF officials are likely to
deliver their verdict this week on Greece's faltering drive to
bring its budget deficit under control. [ID:nLDE74T005]	
 Compounding euro zone debt woes, a government minister in
Ireland said it may have to ask for another loan from the EU and
IMF because it will struggle to return to debt markets to raise
funds next year. [ID:nLDE74S0A2]	
 The euro fell to $1.4263 , having pulled back from
resistance near $1.4327, its 55-day moving average. 
 The single currency, which has bounced off of a two-month
low of $1.3968 hit a week ago on trading platform EBS, also
faces resistance near $1.4369, the top of the cloud on the daily
Ichimoku chart, a technical analysis tool popular among traders.	
 Against a basket of currencies , the dollar was
trading near the 75 line, just shy of a two-week trough hit in
the previous session. 
 A batch of weak data has also raised questions on whether
the U.S. economic recovery is faltering, raising expectations
that authorities may keep interest rates at zero well into 2012,
undermining the dollar's appeal. [ID:nN27109401] [ID:nN27296561]	
 Traders are also awaiting global manufacturing data on
Wednesday for any signs of a slowdown in the world economy.
[ID:nLDE74Q203]	
 While Asian stocks have floundered in recent months, the
appeal of fixed income assets has grown as regional central
banks look set to keep raising interest rates to tackle
inflation. 
 Year-to-date volumes of $47.4 billion in bonds sold in
dollars, euros and yen from Asia ex-Japan, ex-Australia is
already more than half of $83.6 billion transacted in all of
2010. Morgan Stanley projected that at the current pace the
annual tally could end up in excess of $100 billion.	
 London-listed Indian mining company Vedanta Resources
last week priced $1.65 billion worth of five- and
10-year bonds, which marked the largest high-yield bond out of
Asia.[ID:nL3E7GU050]	
 That bullishness hasn't been restricted to such bonds only.	
 Local currency debt have also emerged as a favorite for
after January's selloff with net foreign ownership in Indonesian
rupiah bonds rising to a record.	
 Measured in dollar-adjusted terms, total returns for HSBC
Asia's U.S. dollar bond index is three percent on a year-to-date
basis, according to Thomson Reuters data.	
 Its local currency bond index counterpart has delivered 2.5
percent while MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
is up about 1.5 percent.	
 
 SOUTHEAST ASIA BENEFITS	
 While credits had yet another roaring month, equity indices
across the region were mostly down in May, led by Chinese shares
which are set to post a 7 percent drop.	
 For the day, Japan's Nikkei and Australia
ended down 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, while the
MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
bounced slightly after falling for five consecutive weeks.	
 Southeast Asian markets were the clear outperformers with
Malaysia and Indonesia among the leaders, posting marginal gains
for the month, as authorities demonstrated a greater urgency to
tackle rising prices after an inflation scare in January.	
 ""In the past these (Southeast Asian) markets were very
susceptible to inflationary pressures, but due to better
economic management, they are not so much of a hot potato for
investors nowadays,"" said Khiem Do, chairman of Asia multi-asset
team at Barings Asset Management in Hong Kong.	
 ""As long as North Asia continues to trade in a range and is
dogged by inflationary pressures, these markets will continue to
benefit,"" he said.	
 Elsewhere in markets, U.S. Treasury bond yields held near
six-month lows, with 10-year yields at 3.07 percent
compared to 3.29 percent at the start of the month.	
 In commodity markets, U.S. crude futures 
was broadly stable around the $100.30 per barrel mark. 
 The New Zealand dollar extended its gains to hit its highest
in 26 years of $0.8218 , the kiwi's loftiest level since
it was floated in March 1985.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly
on Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. consumer spending and
housing data stoked worries the recovery is losing momentum,
while commodities headed for a third straight week of gains.
 Wall Street stocks edged up, led by energy and materials
stocks, but trading was light ahead of Monday's U.S. Memorial
Day holiday.
 The euro briefly rose above $1.43 after reassuring comments
out of Europe tempered fears of a near-term Greek default,
although it slipped to another record low versus the Swiss
franc as the region's debt crisis remains far from resolved.
 Pending sales of existing U.S. homes dropped far more than
expected in April to touch a seven-month low, dealing a blow to
hopes of a recovery in the housing market. Separate data showed
U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected in April. For
details see [ID:nN271881]
 ""This data may give an exaggerated impression of housing's
weakness, but it is pretty obvious that the key asset the Fed
wishes to reflate is still struggling, which will keep the
policy spigot wide open, with liquidity finding its way into
more responsive asset markets,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head
of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose nearly 1.0 percent, though they remain on
pace for their biggest monthly percentage losses in a year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 38.82
points, or 0.31 percent, to 12,441.58. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 5.41 points, or 0.41 percent, to
1,331.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 13.94
points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,796.86.
 The inverse correlation of the dollar to equities ""seems to
be a trend that you can focus on as an investor for the time
being,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM
Financial in Westport, Connecticut.
 ""The logic is that a weaker dollar helps increase exports,
sales and profits for multinational companies in the United
States.""
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading stocks
added 0.7 percent. Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 1.2 percent.
 The U.S. dollar <.DXY> fell 0.9 percent against a basket of
major currencies and hit a record low of 0.85111 Swiss franc
. Expectations the Fed will keep monetary policy loose
even as other major central banks are tightening have caused
interest-rate differentials to move against the U.S. currency
in recent months.
 The weaker dollar, along with persistent Middle East
tensions, helped boost oil prices. U.S. crude  settled at
$100.59 a barrel, up 36 cents, having touched $101.24. Brent
crude  touched $115.68 before settling at $115.03 a
barrel, off 2 cents.
 Spot gold  hit $1,538.10 a troy ounce, its highest
since May 4. Gold's appeal has also been boosted in recent
weeks by Europe's debt crisis.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a bellwether for
commodities, was up 0.9 percent for a third week of gains,
though it was set to end the month down nearly 7.0 percent
after a plunge in everything from oil to silver in early May.
 GREECE UNCERTAINTY
 Worries about Greece pushed 10-year German Bund yields
 below the 3.0 percent level after doubts grew on
Thursday over whether the International Monetary Fund would
release the next aid tranche for the debt-laden country.
 Greece's prime minister failed to convince opposition
leaders on Friday to support tougher austerity measures to free
up EU/IMF aid needed to avert a debt default. [ID:nLDE74Q0TQ]
 But the euro gained momentum in the New York session after
European Central Bank Governing Council member George

without restructuring if it sticks to its austerity plan.

 ""Those comments reduce the near-term risk of Greek default
and eased the pressure on the euro,"" said Joe Manimbo, currency
strategist at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington.
 The euro  rose 1.1 percent to $1.4289, though it

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro took off against the
dollar on Friday, helped by comments out of Europe suggesting
that Greece should be able to handle its heavy debt load.
 The euro, however, hit a record low versus the Swiss franc,
as did the dollar, indicating investors remained worried that
sovereign debt problems in Europe, a divisive budget debate in
Washington, and low U.S. interest rates that would hamper both
currencies.
 The euro's rally versus the dollar gained momentum in the
New York session after a member of the European Central Bank
Governing Council, George Provopoulos, said Greece will be able
to repay its debt in full without restructuring if it sticks to
an austerity plan. For details, see [ID:nFAT007211]
 The comments by Provopoulos, who is also head of Greece's
central bank, were followed by remarks from French President
Nicolas Sarkozy, who said France would defend and support the
euro. Sarkozy also said the country opposed any kind of debt
restructuring for Greece. [ID:nP6E7GA026]
 Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at OANDA in
Toronto, said the euro may have seen its low against the dollar
for now and overall he expects a positive outcome to Greece's
debt situation.
 The International Monetary Fund is expected to finalize
next week its fourth review of the Greek economy. At stake is a
12 billion euro tranche that Greece would get on approval of
the review, which may show that Greece is having difficulties
sticking to the planned reforms.
 Danske Bank chief analyst Allan von Mehren said he expects
the IMF to pay the 12 billion euros due next month.
 ""If not, it would not only be seen as a Greek failure, but
also an IMF"" failure after the scandal involving ex-IMF head
Dominique-Strauss-Kahn, he said.
 In midday, New York action, the euro  rose nearly
more than 1.0 percent to $1.428800, but was still off $1.42990,
a one-week high hit in earlier trade. Offers from Asian
sovereign names in the $1.42800 level were seen capping the
single currency's upside.
 Above that, traders said the euro's resistance is around
$1.43396 -- the 38.2 percent retracement of its decline this
month.
 Overall, the euro was up 0.9 percent this week, recovering
from weekly losses of more than 3 percent two weeks ago.
 The euro was also helped by a broadly weak dollar amid a
run of softer U.S. economic data the last few days. On Friday,
the government said U.S. consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in
April, lower than expectations of a 0.5 percent increase.
[ID:nN271881]
 On Thursday, a report showed an unexpected rise in U.S.
initial jobless claims, while a revised government estimate on
first-quarter gross domestic product came in below most
forecasts.
 ""Softer U.S. data may renew the debate about the
introduction of a third round of quantitative easing, and
that's a negative for the dollar,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index <.DXY>, measured against six
major currencies, fell 0.8 percent to 74.978.
 Overall, the combination of negative dollar sentiment and
concerns about heavy euro zone debt is expected to keep the
euro in a range above $1.40 but below last Friday's high around
$1.43458.
 The Swiss franc, which again hit a record high versus the
euro, was seen continuing its climb as Switzerland's economic
and fiscal health far outshines that of the overall euro zone.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent against the franc to 1.21750
 after hitting an all-time low at 1.21550.
 The dollar also dropped to record troughs at
0.85111.
 Analysts said the franc was boosted by a strong reading of
the KOF economic indicator for May and the view that Swiss
interest rates will rise in the coming months. [ID:nZCHQGE790]
 The dollar hit a three-year low versus the New Zealand
dollar , which was last at 0.8184, up 1 percent.

 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Major stock indices and
commodity prices rose on Friday as the dollar weakened broadly
on signs that the U.S. economic recovery is losing momentum.
 The euro rallied against the dollar after reassuring
comments out of Europe tempered fears of a near-term Greek

 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Friday
after positive comments out of Europe tempered fears about
Greece's debt crisis, while broad weakness in the U.S. currency
lifted stock and commodity prices.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro trimmed gains against a
broadly weaker dollar and hit a record low against the
safe-haven Swiss franc on Friday on persisting concerns about
the economic health of some euro zone countries.
 The dollar stayed under pressure following weak U.S. data on
Thursday. Further numbers on Friday, including University of
Michigan sentiment, could put more pressure on the currency,
although traders said moves would be limited ahead of a long
weekend in the UK and United States. 
 The combination of negative dollar sentiment and concerns
about euro zone debt was expected to keep the euro in a range
above $1.4000 but below last Friday's high around $1.4345.
 ""Some in the market are looking to bet against the dollar on
speculation that the Federal Reserve could restart quantitative
easing after June, which should help the euro,"" said Roberto
Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 ""But the market is also recognising there is no great upside
potential for the euro,"" he said, adding he expected the single
currency would struggle to close above $1.4250.
 The Swiss franc, which also hit a record high versus the
dollar, was seen continuing its climb as Switzerland's economic
and fiscal health far outshines that of the euro zone average.
 Traders cited widening spreads between peripheral and core
euro zone bond yields behind the euro's weakness, as well as
concerns about banking sector health as Franco-Belgian group
Dexia  said it would take a large loss as it stepped up
asset divestments. [ID:nLDE74Q0MF]
 Widening yields are a sign of growing concerns about how
several countries will recover from deep-seated fiscal problems,
given ongoing divisions among policymakers on how Greece will
tackle its enormous debt.
 The euro  traded 0.7 percent higher on the day at
$1.4231, retreating from $1.4278, a one-week high hit in earlier
trade. Offers from Asian sovereign names above that level were
seen capping the single currency's upside.
 Above that, the euro's 55-day moving average around $1.4320
may provide an obstacle, along with resistance around $1.4335 --
the 38.2 percent retracement of its decline this month.
 ""The market is finding it fairly difficult to hold onto
positions. If we're back in the ugly competitions between the
euro and the dollar, both have fairly big negatives,"" said
Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at CIBC.
 Analysts said the session suggested investors were unwilling
to take on big positions in either the dollar or the euro given
the problems with debt and growth on both sides of the Atlantic.
 Some investors remain optimistic that European nations will
ultimately reach an agreement on dealing with Greece despite
suggestions Athens may not receive the next tranche of IMF aid.
[ID:nLDE74P1Z2]
 
 SWISSIE AT RECORD HIGHS
 Investors' unwillingness to get too excited about the euro
was evident by its fall to a record low of 1.2167 Swiss francs
 on the EBS trading platform. Due to its safe-haven
status, the franc often gains during times of uncertainty.
 The dollar hit a record low of 0.8534 francs on EBS, and was
last down 1 percent at 0.8572 .
 Analysts said the franc was also boosted by a strong Swiss
economy -- highlighted by a strong reading of the KOF economic
indicator for May -- and the view that Swiss interest rates will
rise in the coming months. [ID:nZCHQGE790]
 ""The Swiss franc has all the right characteristics at the
moment: a current account surplus, a strong fiscal balance, and
we are getting closer to when relative rates will move in favour
of the franc again,"" said Kasper Kirkegaard, currency strategist
at Danske in Copenhagen.
 He added a fall in the euro below 1.20 francs was imminent.
 The dollar hit a three-year low versus the New Zealand
dollar  after data on Thursday showed fresh signs of a
slowdown in the U.S. labour market and the second estimate of
first quarter growth came in below forecasts. [ID:nN26233734]

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - The dollar pared losses and world
stocks and crude prices gave up some of their gains on Friday
after a ratings blow for Japan rattled markets already unsettled
by the euro zone's worsening debt crisis.
 Investors sought security in 10-year German Bunds, sending
yields  back below 3 percent after Fitch cut
Japan's outlook to negative. The rating agency said the massive
cost of a March earthquake and tsunami would pile more strain on
the country's already shaky public finances. [ID:nL3E7GR1A6]
 News that shares in Franco-Belgian financial services group
Dexia  had been suspended in the European mid-morning
also put upward pressure on German bond prices. The bailed out
group said it will speed up its divestment of assets and take a
$5.1 billion hit in the second quarter. [ID:nBRQ010160]
 Benchmark Bund yields probed below what is a key
psychological level on Thursday for the first time since
mid-January due to concerns over a possible Greek debt
restructuring and its impact on other heavily-indebted countries
on the euro zone periphery.
 The weaker dollar, along with persistent Middle East
tensions, helped Brent crude to trade above $115 a barrel,
though it was still headed for its first monthly loss since last
August.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading stocks
put on 0.6 percent, helped by gains in bank shares after the
Financial Times said stringent capital requirements for European
banks could be relaxed. [ID:nLDE74Q00T]
 ""There is a big chance that they don't have to go out to
shareholders to ask for more money and that is the main
advantage because a capital increase will weigh on their stock
prices,"" said Koen de Leus, strategist at KBC Securities.
 ""It's good for banks, but it's not good for regulation. In
the long term it's not a good thing for financial stability.""
 U.S. stock index futures    were flat,
indicating a steady open on Wall Street.
 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.6 percent, though they trimmed some of
the gains after the Fitch announcement and were still set for
their biggest monthly percentage losses in a year.
 Nomura said in a note that global fund investors increased
their selling of equities to a net of $9.4 billion for the week
of May 19-25, the heaviest in 10 months and up from a net
outflow of $5 billion the week before.
 
 DOLLAR PARES LOSSES
 The dollar <.DXY> fell 0.5 percent against a basket of
currencies and was down 0.3 percent against the Japanese
currency at 81.09 yen .
 The euro  was up 0.7 percent at $1.4239 though it was
down 0.3 percent at 1.2197 Swiss francs  after hitting
a record low of 1.2167 francs.
 ""Both (euro and dollar) have fairly big negatives ...
they're struggling to outweigh each other on a durable basis,""
Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at CIBC, said.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries  were up 2
basis points at 3.0772 percent after falling more than 7 basis
points overnight on the back of unexpectedly weak consumer
spending numbers in U.S. first quarter growth data.
 Brent crude prices  held steady and were down 8.5
percent for the month. Copper prices  put on 1.6 percent,
but they were on track for their third straight monthly losses.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski
 TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled broadly on
Friday after weak U.S. economic data dragged the 10-year
Treasury yield down to a six-month low overnight, with the
greenback's drop gaining steam on a flurry of stop-loss
selling.
 The dollar fell across the board, hitting a record low
against the Swiss franc and a three-year low versus the New
Zealand dollar, with traders citing talk of dollar selling by
model funds and U.S. banks, as well as Asian sovereign players.
 The dollar also retreated against emerging Asian currencies
such as the Singapore dollar , and slid 0.6 percent
versus a basket of major currencies to 75.107 <.DXY>, pulling
away from a two-month high of 76.366 hit earlier this week.
 The dollar had rallied earlier in May after a rout in
commodities such as silver  and oil  spooked
investors, prompting them to unwind dollar-funded bets on risky
assets.
 ""Market players had flocked to dollar buying, based on the
view that the dollar tends to rise when investors are looking
to avoid risk,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchange
for State Street Global Markets in Tokyo.
 ""But I think the market got a bit too carried away with
that theme,"" Tomita said.
 The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc of
0.8534 francs on trading platform EBS, and was last down 1
percent at 0.85740 .
 The New Zealand dollar marked a three-year high of $0.8200,
coming within a whisker of a 26-year peak of $0.8215 hit in
March 2008. It was last up 1.1 percent at $0.8186.
 The euro climbed 0.7 percent to $1.4244 , its rise
having gained momentum after hitting stops above the previous
day's high near $1.4207.
 EYES ON U.S. DATA
 A drop in U.S. Treasury yields on Thursday dented the
dollar, giving the single currency some respite from a recent
sell-off on worries over the possibility of debt restructuring
by Greece, which had sent the euro down to a two-month low of
$1.3968 earlier this week.
 ""The dollar has been strong since the start of May but it
looks like that outperformance may be coming to a close,"" said
Junya Tanase, foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan Chase in
Tokyo.
 ""Even if Greece's problems continue to weigh on the euro,
if the dollar does not strengthen much, then the euro's
downside against the dollar may gradually become limited,"" he
said.
 The euro has turned higher after its drop this week stalled
right near its 100-day moving average and also the bottom of
the cloud on daily Ichimoku charts, a form of Japanese
technical analysis popular among market players.
 But one cloud hanging over the euro is mounting concern
over whether Greece will receive its next round of aid from the
IMF.
 Comments on Thursday by Jean-Claude Juncker, president of
the Eurogroup finance ministers, raised concerns that Greece
may not get the next 12 billion euros in aid from the
International Monetary Fund that is needed to cover immediate
funding needs.[ID:nLDE74P1Z2]
 The dollar retreated after data on Thursday showed fresh
signs of a slowdown in the U.S. labour market and the second
estimate of first quarter U.S. growth came in below forecasts,
spurring a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield to a six-month
low. [ID:nN26233734]
 ""All eyes are on U.S. employment data out next Friday,""
said Teppei Ino, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ.
 ""If those figures also come in below the market's
expectations, the market may get excited about the possibility
of QE3 or some other form of monetary easing, putting more
pressure on the dollar,"" Ino said.
 The 10-year Treasury yield stood last stood at 3.059
percent . It hit a six-month low near 3.0530 percent
on Thursday.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, May 27 (Reuters) - Asian stocks posted solid
gains for a second consecutive day on Friday as market players
scooped up bargains while the euro pushed higher, though the
currency's gains may be limited for now as fears of a Greek
default weighed on sentiment.	
 Noting the chunky gains in Asian stocks, European stock
index futures pointed to early gains while the S&P e-mini
futures  rose 0.1 percent, suggesting a higher start on
Wall Street later in the day. 
 While the euro enjoyed a brief respite versus the
U.S. dollar due to thinning yield differentials, it plumbed to a
record low against the Swiss franc in a sign that traders remain
focused on the rapidly escalating situation in the euro zone.	
 Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of euro zone finance ministers
rattled markets when he said the International Monetary Fund
could withhold the next slice of aid to Greece due next month,
raising the spectre of default, though his spokesman later
softened some of his comments. [ID:nLDE74P1HC]	
 While markets have been under pressure in recent weeks due
to a steady stream of bad news from the euro zone, Asian stocks
and bonds have held up fairly well as recent data prints and
positioning comforted investors on the region's growth outlook. 
 
 Korea was among the top gainers as foreign investors
trooped back, snapping a long selling streak. Solid current
account surplus numbers in April too played its part.	
 Stocks outside Japan were up 0.7 percent on
Friday even though the index is set for a fifth consecutive week
of losses -- its longest string of losses since October 2008.	
 ""Downside risks for large caps are capped by its
increasingly attractive valuations,"" said Wang Aochao, an
analyst with UOB Kay Hian in Shanghai. ""So with small caps
looking overvalued, it looks like investors will continue to
switch out of them and into large caps in the near term.""	
 Japanese shares were among the exceptions to the gainers,
with the benchmark Nikkei average down 0.42 percent and
the Topix index down 0.3 percent on the day.	
 While concerns of a Greek restructuring kept investors
cautious about adding big positions in stocks, they had no such
qualms towards fixed-income assets as Asian policymakers stepped
up their battle to fight inflation by tightening policy.	
 Latest data from Thomson Reuters Lipper showed net inflows
of $94 million into high yield funds and a $1 billion inflow
into corporate investment grade funds in the week of May 25.	
 
 DESPERATELY SEEKING CONFIDENCE	
 In currency markets, the euro turned higher after its drop
this week stalled right near its 100-day moving average and also
the bottom of the cloud on daily Ichimoku charts, a form of
Japanese technical analysis popular among market players.	
 Still, it is expected to stay within recent established
trading ranges until confidence is restored on the Greek debt
crisis and the market refocuses on the outlook for euro zone
interest rates, which would be supportive for the single
currency, Brown Brothers Harriman strategists said in a note.	
 For now though, the double whammy of weak U.S. economic data
and falling U.S. Treasury yields offered support to the euro.	
 In another sign that the U.S. economy has hit a soft patch,
jobless claims for last week unexpectedly rose while annual GDP
growth came in lower than analysts had expected. [ID:nN26233734]	
 The weak data took the wind out of commodity markets,
particularly oil , which dropped more than 1 percent
overnight, but recovered to hold above the $100 per barrel line.	
 In bond markets, U.S. Treasuries rallied and
benchmark yields fell to new six-month lows with ten-year note
yields breaking below their 200-day moving average.
They were last at 3.06 percent, their lowest level since early
December. 
 Other safe-haven assets like gold and silver received a
boost from the Greece situation. Silver recovered after
falling in the previous session while gold inched higher.

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc on Thursday on worries that Greece was
again teetering on the brink of financial crisis, driving a bid
for safe-haven U.S. government bonds.
 Comments from Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker
rattled markets and raised doubts about whether the
International Monetary Fund would release Greece's next round
of financial assistance at the end of June. [ID:nLDE74P1HC]
 After initially wobbling over the Greece worries, U.S.
stocks squeezed out modest gains, but U.S. crude oil fell more
than 1 percent on disappointing U.S. economic growth and jobs
data.
 Still, the euro zone sovereign debt fears stuck with
investors.
 ""There has been a lot of back and forth between the EU and
the ECB on IMF aid to Greece, and that does not help the euro
at all,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT
Forex in New York.
 The latest U.S. economic data underscored the view that the
country's recovery has hit a rough patch.
 The U.S. economy grew at an annual 1.8 percent rate in the
first three months of this year, the Commerce Department said,
unchanged from an earlier estimate and weaker than most
forecasts.
 A separate report from the Labor Department showed the
number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits unexpectedly
rose last week by 10,000 to 424,000. For details, see
[ID:nN26233734]
 The euro was down for a fifth day against the Swiss franc.
It fell as low as 1.22045 Swiss francs on electronic trading
platform EBS  and last traded down 0.5 percent on
the day at 1.2242 francs.
 Against the dollar, the euro changed hands at $1.4128
, up 0.3 percent on the day. It had earlier risen to
$1.42069 on EBS after an article in the Financial Times quoted
the chief of the European Financial Stability Facility as
saying China was ""clearly interested"" in buying bonds for the
Portugal bailout to be issued in mid-June. [ID:nL3E7GQ04U]
 The U.S. dollar <.DXY> was down 0.5 percent against a
basket of major currencies.
 U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note  prices
rose 20/32, with a yield of 3.06 percent, the lowest level
since Dec 7.
 ""For the U.S. economy, it's like Groundhog Day like what we
saw a year ago,"" when the economy weakened after the end of the
first quantitative easing program, said Bob Baur, chief global
economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa,
which oversees $235 billion in assets.
 Stocks brushed aside those concerns, and focused instead on
upbeat earnings from companies including Tiffany & Co ,
whose shares gained 8.6 percent to $76.04. NetApp Inc's
 stock also was buoyed by strong results.
 Stocks have struggled in recent weeks to extend their
latest rally that began in September. The benchmark Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> has gained 27 percent since the end of
August.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 8.10 points,
or 0.07 percent, to end at 12,402.76. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> gained 5.22 points, or 0.40 percent, to end at
1,325.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> advanced 21.54
points, or 0.78 percent, to end at 2,782.92.
 The MSCI Latin American index <.MILA00000PUS> rose 1.8
percent, adding to gains that have pulled it off an eight-month
low reached on Monday. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index
<.FTEU3> ended down 0.07 percent.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July crude
contract  fell $1.09, or 1.08 percent, to settle at
$100.23 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 12 cents to settle at
$115.05 a barrel.
 Gold was led down by a drop in euro-priced bullion after
the single European currency came under sudden pressure,
although safe-haven buying limited declines.
 Spot gold declined to $1,520.40 an ounce. On
Wednesday, bullion prices rose to $1,532.10 their strongest
since May 4.

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro hit a record low
versus the Swiss franc on Thursday on mounting doubts whether
Greece will receive its next round of aid from the IMF, and the
worries are likely to keep the single currency under pressure.
 Comments by Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the Eurogroup
finance ministers, raised concerns that Greece may not get the
next 12 billion euros in aid from the International Monetary
Fund that is needed to cover immediate funding needs. For
details, see [ID:nLDE74P1Z2]
 Heightened anxiety over Europe's sovereign debt crisis has
driven the five-day slide in the euro versus the safe-haven
Swissie.
 ""The currency pair's performance is a reflection of the
extreme nervousness existing in the market in relation to the
sovereign debt crisis,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency
research at GFT Forex in New York. ""There has been a lot of
back and forth between the EU and the ECB on IMF aid to Greece,
and that does not help the euro at all.""
 The euro fell as low as 1.22045 Swiss francs on electronic
trading platform EBS  and last traded down 0.5
percent on the day at 1.2234 francs.
 It also hit a 2-1/2-month low against sterling
.
 Inspectors from the European Union, the European Central
Bank and the IMF must assess whether Greece has made sufficient
progress to receive the next round of aid under the country's
110 billion euro international bailout, though there is not
specific date set for a decision. Government officials have
said that the next installment must be disbursed by July 15.

 Because Switzerland relies heavily on its exports, the
Swiss National Bank could attempt to talk the franc lower since
direct intervention in the past has fallen short of
expectations, Lien said.
 ""The performance of the Swiss franc is something to keep an
eye on as it serves as an important gauge of sentiment in the
euro zone,"" she said.
 Against the dollar, the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.4128
. It earlier rose to $1.42069 on EBS after an article
in the Financial Times quoted the chief of the European
Financial Stability Facility as saying China was ""clearly
interested"" in buying bonds for the Portugal bailout to be
issued in mid-June. [ID:nL3E7GQ04U]
 The euro's support lies around the psychologically
important level of $1.4000, traders said, which also marks the
200-week moving average. The 100-day moving average is at
around $1.3996.
 If the euro makes a sustained break below $1.4000, then
$1.3770, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro's
rise from June 2010 to May 2011, may be a key support, traders
said.
 GROWING PRESSURE
 Pressure has grown on Greece to accelerate reforms and
asset sales in return for international aid. Fears of a
potential restructuring of Greek debt and the potential of
contagion to bigger economies such as Spain and Italy have
pushed the euro down 6 percent against the dollar since May.
 Brown Brothers Harriman said while the odds of Greece
exiting the euro zone are no longer insignificant, it is not as
high as 50 percent as some speculate.
 ""However, we do agree that bondholders will eventually have
to accept significant haircuts on principal,"" the firm noted.
""The only question is when, as European policy makers continue
to try to kick the can down the road until 2013, when the
banking sector will be less vulnerable and will hopefully be
strong enough to take the hit.""
 Against the yen, the U.S. dollar on Thursday fell 0.8
percent to 81.30 yen after hitting a session low of 81.15 on
EBS , hurt by disappointing U.S. economic data.
[ID:nN26233734]
 The dollar hit a low of 79.56 yen earlier this month, but
over the past week gains have been capped by the 100-day simple
moving average at 82.25. That level is a key resistance point
created not only by the moving average, but also the second
standard deviation Bollinger band and the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the March to April rally.

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on
Thursday in a rebound from recent losses while the euro hit a
record low against the Swiss franc on renewed euro zone debt
concerns.
 U.S. oil prices declined along with gold, while bond prices
advanced.
 Technology shares led gains on Wall Street, which has been
pressured along with other risky assets by worries of a
slowdown in economic growth.
 Comments from the president of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude
Juncker, raised doubts over a disbursement by the International
Monetary fund of financial support to Greece in June and added
to recent market jitters about debt problems in the euro zone.
 Disappointing U.S. economic data weighed on oil and stocks
earlier in the day.
 The U.S. government kept its estimate of first-quarter
economic growth unchanged at 1.8 percent after economists had
forecast an upward revision from the initial estimate. A
surprise rise in weekly jobless claims added to the latest
batch of disappointing U.S. data. For details, see
[ID:nN26233734]
 But stocks brushed aside those worries, turning higher in
afternoon trading.
""It speaks to the internal strength of the market that
people think the internal momentum hasn't been broken yet,""
said Jim Awad, managing director at Zephyr Management in New
York.
 Stocks have struggled in recent weeks to extend their
latest rally that began in September. The benchmark Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> has gained 27 percent since the start

percent, adding to the week's gains, which have pulled it off
an eight-month low reached on Monday. In Europe, the
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> ended down 0.07 percent.
 The euro was down for a fifth day against the Swiss franc.
It fell as low as 1.22045 Swiss francs on electronic trading

the day at 1.2242 francs.
 ""There's so much uncertainty. It's going to be hard for the
euro to move much higher,"" said Ronald Simpson, director of
currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida. ""It
continues to be sold on even modest upticks.""
 Against the dollar, the euro changed hands at $1.4142
, up 0.4 percent on the day, helped by a news report
suggesting Asia is willing to help ease Europe's debt woes.
 The Financial Times quoted the head of the European
Financial Stability Facility as saying China and other Asian
investors were expected to buy a ""strong proportion"" of
Portuguese bailout bonds when the euro zone's rescue fund

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks lost early gains

(Updates with euro retreat; adds comment, details)
 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc on Thursday after comments from
Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker raised doubts about
whether the IMF would release the next aid tranche for Greece.
 The euro also trimmed most gains versus the U.S. dollar,
after earlier climbing above $1.42 on a news report China is
interested in buying bailout bonds for Portugal.
 ""The market was caught a bit long up near $1.42 and then
Juncker's saying the IMF may not release the next tranche for
Greece really got the market worried. Everyone was hitting bids
and asking questions later,"" said Steven Butler, head of
trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The euro fell as low as 1.2235 Swiss francs, according to
electronic trading platform EBS , before recovering
slightly to 1.2243 francs, down 0.5 percent on the day.
 Against the dollar, the euro was last at $1.4094, up 0.1
percent .
 Support lies around the psychologically important level of
$1.4000, which also marks the 200-week moving average. The
100-day moving average is just below there at around $1.3996.
 If the euro does make a sustained break below $1.4000 then
$1.3770, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro's
rise from June 2010 to May 2011, could be a key support,
traders said.
 The International Monetary Fund cannot continue to lend to
Greece until it has financing assurances from EU partner
countries for the bailout program, an IMF spokeswoman said on
Thursday. See [ID:nN26191961]
 Should the International Monetary Fund not pay its next
tranche of aid to Greece, then there would be pressure on
reluctant European countries to do so, Juncker said.
 ""If the Europeans have to acknowledge that the disbursement
from the IMF on 29 June cannot be operationally implemented
then the expectation of the IMF is that the Europeans would
step in for the IMF and take upon themselves the IMF's portion
of the financing,"" he said at a conference.
 ""That won't work because in certain parliaments -- Germany,

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and oil fell on
Thursday due to disappointing economic data, while the euro hit
a one-week peak versus the dollar, helped by a report on
China's possible interest in ""bailout"" bonds for Portugal.
 This encouraging development for the euro zone trimmed
safe-haven demand for gold, pushing it down from a three-week
high set on Wednesday.
 Investor conviction to own stocks, commodities, and other
risky assets remains fragile as the United States struggles to
support growth and European policy-makers deal with the
persistent debt problems of peripheral nations.
 ""Market sentiment is cautious. Right now the improvement
(in U.S. growth) has paused. Europe is a visceral negative,""
said Mark Pawlak, market strategist with Keefe Bruyette & Woods
in New York.
 Wall Street stocks and the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
fell about 0.3 percent.
 In its second estimate on U.S. economic performance, the
government did not upwardly revised its first-quarter growth of
1.8 percent as forecast by economists. Adding to the latest
batch of disappointing U.S. data was a surprise rise in weekly
jobless claims. For more, see [ID:nN26233734]
 These negative economic figures overshadowed a news report
that suggests Asia is willing to help ease Europe's debt woes.
 The Financial Times quoted the head of the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) as saying China and other
Asian investors were expected to buy a ""strong proportion"" of
Portuguese bailout bonds when the euro zone's rescue fund
starts auctioning them next month. See [ID:nL3E7GQ04U]
 The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4149 , while The
dollar <.DXY> fell half a percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 However, investors remain concerned about the possibility
of Greek debt restructuring, uncertainty over whether Greece
will agree new austerity measures and the potential for
contagion into the likes of Spain and Italy. [ID:nLDE74O1MZ]
 ""There are ongoing concerns about euro zone peripheral
debt. We're not out of the woods by any stretch of the
imagination,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles
Stanley.
 Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> closed 1.5 percent higher, following
Tuesday's in U.S. and European equities.
 In the oil market, U.S. crude oil  fell 93 cents to
$101.37 a barrel, erasing earlier gains.
 Spot gold was last bid at $1,515.19 an ounce, down from
$1,523.30 in New York late on Wednesday.

 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - World stocks rose from a
two-month low on Thursday while the euro hit a one-week peak
versus the dollar, helped by a report on China's possible
interest in ""bailout"" bonds for Portugal.
 Asian stocks rose 1.7 percent and Wall Street was set for a
firmer open after ending a three-day losing streak on Wednesday.
This encouraged investors to buy the euro and risky assets,
although uncertainty over whether Greece would need to
restructure its debt capped gains.
 ""(The China story) fitted into better risk sentiment at that
moment,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea
in Copenhagen.
 ""This euro rally is very fragile and the euro is vulnerable
to what is going on in the euro zone.""
 The Financial Times quoted the head of the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) as saying China and other

 ""There are ongoing concerns about euro zone peripheral debt.

said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley.
MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.5 percent,
bringing its gains this year to three percent. The FTSEurofirst
300 index <.FTEU3> added 0.5 percent, led by banks and mining
shares. U.S. stock futures  were up around 0.2 percent.
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> gained 1.2 percent.
 The dollar <.DXY> fell half a percent against a basket of
major currencies. The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4181 .
 U.S. crude oil  fell 0.3 percent to $101.01 a barrel,
erasing earlier gains.
 But losses were limited on strong underlying demand for
commodities. Reflecting that, the Baltic Dry Index <.BADI>,
which tracks rates to ship dry commodities, rose to its highest
level in seven weeks on Wednesday.
 
 GREEK YIELDS RISE
 The Greek government is scrambling to resolve a stand-off
with its opposition over austerity measures and Greece's EU
commissioner warned on Wednesday that its euro membership was at
risk if it failed to agree to sacrifices. [ID:nLDE74O1MZ]
 Greek two-year yields rose 43 basis points to 26.9 percent
 but the premium investors demand to hold Spanish
and Italian government bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds
  fell after the FT report on China.
 The EFSF will hold its first auction to raise funds for the
recently-approved 78 billion euro Portuguese bailout in
mid-June.
 ""We know central banks are buying a lot of this kind of
paper, it's just a bit of positive news amongst all the noise on
Greece,"" said a trader.
 ""But there seems to be growing political dissent on further
bailouts so it's really down to Greece to get their house in
order.""

 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a one-week high
against the dollar on Thursday, helped by a a report that China
is interested in buying ""bailout bonds"" for Portugal, though
concerns over euro zone debt were expected to limit gains.
 Traders and analysts said the euro's failure to break below
$1.40 may have encouraged some investors to close short
positions, but reported offers above $1.4200 were expected to
keep it trapped well below Friday's high around $1.4345.
 Better risk sentiment, marked by gains in equities and oil
prices, also helped the euro and commodity-linked currencies,
with the New Zealand dollar soaring close to a three-year high
versus the greenback.
 Euro buying was encouraged by a Financial Times article
quoting the chief executive of the European Financial Stability
Facility as saying China was interested in buying bonds for the
Portugal bailout, to be issued in mid-June. [ID:nL3E7GQ04U]
 However, investors remain concerned about the possibility of
Greek debt restructuring, uncertainty over whether Greece will
agree new austerity measures and the potential for contagion
affecting the likes of Spain and Italy. [ID:nLDE74O1MZ]
 ""It is difficult to judge how reliable the story (on China
buying Portuguese bailout bonds) is, but it fitted into better
risk sentiment at that moment,"" said Niels Christensen, currency
strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""This euro rally is very fragile and the euro is vulnerable
to what is going on in the euro zone,"" he said, though he added
he expected it to stay above $1.4000 for the moment.
 The euro was up 0.65 percent at $1.4177 , with traders
citing Middle East demand, though offers around $1.4200 kept it
below that level, with the high at $1.4197. Earlier, traders
reported stop-loss euro purchases at $1.4120 and $1.4150.
 The single currency has solid technical support just below
$1.4000 which is expected to keep it propped up, including the
100-day moving average, now around $1.3996, and another support
seen near $1.3968, a two-month low struck earlier this week.
 Below that point, $1.3770 was seen as important as it is a
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro's rise from June
2010 to May 2011.
 
 KIWI, AUSSIE JUMP
 Gains in commodities, including particularly strong gains in
oil, and better risk sentiment lifted commodity-linked
currencies, with the Australian dollar  up 0.7 percent
at $1.0600, well above a low of $1.0440 hit on Wednesday.
 The New Zealand dollar  was particularly strong,
jumping 1.4 percent to $0.8086 and coming close to the early May
high of $0.8122, its highest since March 2008. Traders cited New
Zealand website ""Interest.co.nz"", which reported on China's
potential interest in buying New Zealand assets.
 The Aussie was also helped by data showing capital spending
in Australia picked up speed in the March quarter, rising 3.4
percent against expectations for a 2.5 percent rise.
 The safe-haven Swiss franc backed off from record high
levels against the euro  as risk-averse investors'
follow-through moves were limited, traders said. The euro was
trading up 0.3 percent at 1.2344 Swiss francs  after
hitting a record low of 1.2270 francs the previous day.
 The euro gained support the previous day after Finland
approved an EU/IMF bailout for Portugal, while demand from hedge
funds also prompted a squeeze in euro short positions.
 ""We've seen the euro test downwards recently, but I feel
there are plenty of euro-buying needs as European investors
would want to repatriate funds ahead of more potential stress
tests in Europe,"" said Hideki Amikura, a forex manager at Nomura
Trust and Banking in Tokyo.
 The dollar was down slightly against the yen at 81.95 yen
, with traders reporting bids at 81.20-70 yen. Traders
said oil price strength prompted some to unwind long dollar
positions ahead of a three-day weekend in the United States and
in European markets.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE, May 26 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were on course
for their biggest gain in a month on Thursday, led by resources
and consumer sectors, with recovering commodity prices and the
euro's rebound toward $1.42 bringing investors back into the
markets in search of bargains.	
 The risks surrounding the euro have not eased much, with
Greece fighting to avoid a debt restructuring that could have a
huge ripple effect across other high risk-European countries
struggling with gaping fiscal deficits. [ID:nLDE74O1MZ]	
 For now though, the pendulum was swinging back to risk
taking on Thursday, with volatility in precious metals and crude
prices having faded, allowing investors to scamper back to scoop
up recently beaten-down shares, albeit in reduced trading
volumes.	
 European stock index futures pointed to early gains while
U.S. S&P 500 futures  rose 0.2 percent, suggesting a
higher open on Wall Street later in the day after closing well
off the lows of the day overnight. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average climbed 1.5 percent ,
with camera maker Canon Inc leading the charge. The
stock surged 5.8 percent after it said on Wednesday that would
buy back 50 billion yen ($610 million) of its own shares.	
 The Nikkei has been in a fairly narrow downtrend in May,
though this week has bounced off of the April low.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
1.7 percent , the biggest daily percentage gain
since April 20, after closing at a two-month low on Wednesday.	
 Among the domestic benchmark indexes, Korea was out in
front, with the KOSPI up 2.8 percent on the first net
buying by foreign investors in 10 days. 
 Investors kept their buying focused mostly in the energy,
materials and consumer discretionary sectors, areas of the
market that have been among the highest returning segments so
far this year.	
 ""The two key themes for those with a longer-term view remain
demographics and consumption,"" said Sarah Lien, senior research
analyst with Russell Investments.	
 ""We're seeing managers still add to consumption-related
stories. The thing to remember in Asia, though, is that sectors
such as property, insurance and wealth management are also a
play on consumption as disposable income rises,"" she said.	
 A survey by Russell Investments of 40 institutional managers
globally found 63 percent still rate Asia as the most attractive
investment destination, with the United States the next
most-favoured at 14 percent.	
 A sustained equity rally in Asia with a pickup in trading
volumes before the summer lull may be enough to attract some
investors back to the region. The Asia Pacific ex-Japan index
has underperformed the all-country world stocks index so far
this year, slipping 0.3 percent compared with a 2.7 percent rise
in global shares.	
 
 EURO REBOUNDS, BUT FOR HOW LONG?	
 The euro was up 0.7 percent at $1.4188 in the early
Asian afternoon, after bears were unable to push the currency
below the 100-day moving average this week.	
 Hedge funds eager to trim their bets against the euro after
it made little progress below $1.40 earlier this week helped to
push it back up in Asia trading.	
 A Financial Times report also cited by traders as supporting
the euro said that China and other Asian investors would buy a
""strong proportion"" of bailout bonds for Portugal to be issued
next month by the European Financial Stability Facility.
[ID:nL3E7GQ04U] 
 ""We've seen the euro test downwards recently, but I feel
there are plenty of euro-buying needs as European investors
would want to repatriate funds ahead of more potential stress
tests in Europe,"" said Hideki Amikura, a forex manager at Nomura
Trust and Banking in Tokyo. 
 The Australian dollar , which serves as a weather vane
of investor risk taking, was up 0.7 percent at $1.0603 ,
trimming nearly all its losses on the week. 
 Oil futures were trying to add to the week's gains. U.S.
crude for July was up 0.3 percent at $101.61 a barrel 
while Brent was steady at $114.93 a barrel .	
 U.S. crude has bounced $7 since hitting the lowest since mid
February in early May.	
 Precious metals edged higher, helped by the softer dollar.
Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,529.56 an ounce and
silver was up 2.2 percent to $38.72 , rallying for the
third straight session.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Antoni Slodkowski
 TOKYO, May 26(Reuters) - The euro regained some ground
against the dollar on Thursday as a sharp recovery in oil
prices induced short-covering, but lingering uncertainty over
debt problems in Greece and other euro zone countries were
expected to limit strong follow-up buying.
 The safe-haven Swiss franc backed off from record high
levels against the euro  as risk adverse investors
follow-through moves were limited, Tokyo traders said.
 The euro took a breather in early Asian trade as the dollar
was weighed down slightly by strength in U.S. crude oil futures
prices  and other commodities the previous day.
 ""We really don't know how debt problems in Greece and other
euro zone areas will be resolved, which would be negative for
the euro, but for now strong oil prices are helping the single
currency,"" said Junya Tanase, forex strategist at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank.
 ""Higher crude oil prices above $100 could be negative for
the dollar, while the euro could benefit,"" Tanase said.
 The euro was trading up 0.2 percent at $1.4120  as of
early Asian trade.
 The euro firmed against the Swiss franc, standing at
$1.2321  after hitting a record low of $1.2270 the
previous day.
 ""Safe-haven demand is keeping the Swiss franc buoyant,
especially against the euro, but it's tough to take new longs
in the Swissie from current levels,"" said a forex dealer at a
Japanese securities house.
 The euro gained some support the previous day after Finland
approved an EU/IMF bailout for Portugal, while demand from
hedge funds also prompted a squeeze in euro short positions.
 The market lacked energy to push the single currency
further down, with a slew technical support levels cited below
the psychologically important $1.4000-level.
 The euro faced chart support at the 100-day moving average,
now at $1.3996, while stop-loss offers are said to be lurking
near $1.3968, a two-month low struck earlier this week on
trading platform EBS.
 Below that point, $1.3770 was seen as important as it is
the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro's rise from
June 2010 to May 2011.
 On the upside, resistance for the euro was looming around
$1.43 -- the area where the euro moved in the first half of
May, a trader at a Japanese bank said.
 The greenback was little changed around 82 yen .
 Market players were looking to test its one-month high of
82.20-30 yen in the near term.
 Tokyo dealers said some offers were cited around the high
of 82.20 yen, but that the dollar may pick up momentum should
resistance be broken, Tokyo dealers said.
 Stop-loss sell orders were cited at 81.80 yen and 81.20/30
yen, while U.S. and European investors, as well as macro hedge
funds, showed appetite for buying dollars on dips, they said.
