5,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2016 05:39PM ET</span>","EUR/USD bounces off 1-week low, as investors await start of FOMC meeting","Investing.com -- EUR/USD bounced off one-week lows on Monday, as dollar sentiment remained weak ahead of a highly-anticipated interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, when the U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave short-term rates unchanged.
The currency pair traded between 1.1232 and 1.1303 before settling at 1.1292, up 0.0053 or 0.46% on the session. With the considerable gains, the euro ended a three-day losing streak against the dollar. Over the last month, the euro has been relatively flat against its American counterpart, down 0.75% during the period. More broadly, EUR/USD is up 4% since starting the year at 1.086.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1616, the high from May 3.
Investors continued to prepare for the likelihood that the Federal Open Market Committee will hold interest rates steady when the FOMC completes a two-day meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Still, Fed chair Janet Yellen could provide key clues on whether a July rate hike will remain on the table if she schedules a press conference for next month's meeting. Currently, Yellen only has sessions scheduled with the media following each of the FOMC's quarterly meeting when the Committee also releases long-term economic projections for its GDP, inflation and Federal Funds Rate outlook. Typically, the FOMC has refrained from adjusting interest rates without calling a press conference immediately following a monetary policy meeting. 
The chances of a July rate hike, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool, stood at 17.9% on Monday, down from 43.2% a month earlier. The market also sees practically no chance of a rate hike during this week's meeting. The current probability of a June rate hike remained at 1.9% in Monday's session, sharply below last month's estimate of 26.3%.
The FOMC has left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.25% to an intraday low of 94.30, before rallying to 94.42 at the end of U.S. afternoon trading. The index is down by more than 5% since early-December.
Elsewhere, foreign exchange traders continued to keep a close eye on Brexit polls in the U.K. after a YouGov poll showed that the ""Leave,"" campaign overtook the ""Stay"" campaign in the latest survey, reversing a narrow lead from a poll last week. A separate poll from The Guardian showed that the Leave vote took a six-point lead over respondents in favor of staying in the European Union, excluding voters who are still undecided. Separately, The Guardian's poll found that approximately one-third of voters will not decide on their vote until a week before the June 23 referendum.
It came after another survey released last Friday by research firm ORB found that 55% of British voters support leaving the EU, while 45% are in favor of staying in the European bloc. A slew of major world leaders including U.K. prime minister David Cameron, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde have issued stark warnings on the ramifications a British departure from the EU could have on the global economy at large.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2016 01:50PM ET</span>","China's yuan trade system to open branches in London, New York","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's state-owned currency marketplace said on Sunday it was preparing to open branches in London and New York as part of efforts to promote the yuan's global status.
The China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS), a subsidiary of China's central bank, said in a statement that by expanding its network offshore, it aims to serve more overseas institutions and become a ""main trading platform and pricing center"" for the yuan globally.
China has been gradually loosening its capital controls to allow more foreign participation in its onshore yuan market. Beijing is also fostering offshore yuan centers to promote international use of the Chinese currency.
CFETS provides an electronic bidding system for the yuan against foreign currencies. It also offers cross-rate trading, as well as RMB interbank lending and bond trading. Yuan-based trading on CFETS totaled 618.12 trillion yuan ($94.24 trillion)in 2015, according to official Xinhua News Agency. 
The CFETS said that it would further strengthen cooperation with overseas trading platforms, and aim to eventually provide trading services 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The market platform extended its trading hours for China's onshore yuan this year to end trading at 11:30 p.m. local time from 4:30 p.m. previously. 
""CFETS is willing to provide comprehensive service and support to British institutions who participate in China's inter-bank market, and strengthen cooperation with them as Chinese companies go offshore,"" Sun Jie, executive vice president of CFETS, told an event in Shanghai.
The event, focused on the topic of yuan's internationalization, was attended by Chinese and British regulators, as well as financial institutions. 
Britain and China have been working hard in recent years to strengthen their economic relationship, despite strong differences due to Britain's criticism of China's human rights record. Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Britain last October to seal what both call a ""golden time"" in relations.
Xavier Rolet, CEO of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE), told the same event on Sunday that London is now the world's biggest offshore yuan center after Hong Kong.
LSE is working with the Shanghai Stock Exchange to launch a cross-border investment scheme to link the British and Chinese stock markets.

19,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 10, 2016 05:55PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls sharply amid mounting Brexit fears, bond yield rout","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell considerably on Friday dropping to fresh 1-week lows, as fresh Brexit concerns and a massive government bond yield rout throughout the euro zone sent investors scurrying toward the dollar.
The currency pair traded between 1.1246 and 1.1322, before settling at 1.1252, down 0.51% on the session. With the sharp losses, the euro extended previous declines from this week and erased all of its gains from last Friday's session when it surged nearly 2% following a weak U.S. jobs report. On Friday, the euro settled below 1.13 against its American counterpart for the first time in seven sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1616, the high from May 3.
Investors continued to pile into safe-haven assets on Friday, as government bond yields worldwide tumbled to fresh record lows. Yields on the Germany 10-Year fell as low as 0.02%, as more than 75% of German government bond yields hovered in negative territory. Throughout the euro zone, bond prices remained high as yields in the U.K, France,Italy and Spain provided unattractive options for investors. It came one day after Janus Capital's Bill Gross cautioned that a $10 trillion pile of negative yielding government bonds could amount to a ""supernova that will explode one day."" 
In the last month alone, yields on each of the five aforementioned government bonds have plummeted at least 10 basis points. Over the last year, German bund yields have crashed nearly 100 basis points, while yields on 10-year U.K. Gilts and France Oats have plunged approximately 90 basis points. In Japan, government bond yields fell three basis points to Minus-0.17%. Over the last five months, Japanese 10-year bond yields have slumped more than 20 basis points since the Bank of Japan adopted a controversial negative interest rate policy in January.
The dollar also extended earlier gains after an ORB Brexit poll released on Friday showed that 55% of voters support a referendum to leave the European Union. UK prime minister David Cameron, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde and a host of key Federal Reserve policymakers have expressed significant concerns of the ramifications that could result from a UK departure from the EU.
Elsewhere, the dollar also received strong upside pressure from solid consumer spending data on Friday morning. Earlier, Michigan's Consumer Survey Center said its consumer sentiment index fell by 0.4 to 94.3, remaining near one-year highs. Consumer sentiment has stabilized since May's robust flash report when the index soared nearly eight points, posting its best monthly reading in six years. At a closely-watched speech on Monday, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen credited a significant increase in consumer spending for helping bolster GDP growth expectations over the second quarter.
While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not expected to raise short-term interest rates when it meets next week, Yellen has yet to rule out a summer interest rate hike. The FOMC has left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its three meetings this year.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.35% to an intraday high of 94.46. The index is still down by more than 5% since early-December.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields."

The report also showed that Canada’s unemployment rate fell to 6.9% last month from 7.1% in April. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged in May.

On Thursday, betting odds supplied by Betfair showed that the implied probability of a British vote to stay in the EU rose by at least two percentage points to 78%. Earlier in the week, betting odds indicated a 72% probability of an In vote.
Separately, according to a majority of analysts in a Reuters poll released on Wednesday, the recent slowdown in U.K. economic growth is largely due to uncertainty over the June 23 referendum.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar clung to modest gains early on Friday, having bounced off one-month lows as the euro took a heavy spill while sterling stayed under a cloud on jitters over the upcoming Brexit vote.
The dollar index stood at 94.130 (DXY), pulling away from a trough near 93.400. Driving the index's rise was a bearish turn in the euro, which slid to $1.1316  from a one-month high of $1.1416. 
A Reuters report on Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) looking to put billions of euros in vaults rather than pay a penalty charge for parking them with the European Central Bank appeared to have unsettled an already nervous market.
""It seems the news made waves early in the European session Thursday, our London team reporting that this was credited for the euro being sold across the board,"" analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note to clients.
The common currency also plumbed a fresh three-year low of 120.315 yen (EURJPY=R) but has since drifted up to 121.075.
The market continued to give sterling a wide berth, pushing the currency to $1.4464 , well off this week's peak of $1.4664. 
The pound was back near the bottom of a $1.4350-$1.4750 range, just two weeks out before Britons vote in the referendum on EU membership.
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said financial markets may be under pricing the risk of Britain leaving the EU.
With the euro zone and the UK in focus overnight, the dollar enjoyed a small reprieve. Dollar bulls had been hit hard since last Friday's disappointing payrolls data convinced investors that the Federal Reserve will not hike rates at next week's policy review.
A fresh batch of U.S. data on Thursday was more encouraging with a surge in wholesale inventories in April prompting economists to lift their second-quarter economic growth estimates.
A stand out performer was the New Zealand dollar, which staged a broad rally after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Thursday skipped a chance to cut interest rates and appeared reluctant to cut again.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1305 and 1.1416, before settling at 1.1318, down 0.69% on the session. Over a volatile last month of trading, the euro is still up by nearly 1% against the dollar. Despite Thursday's considerable losses, the euro has still settled above 1.13 at the close of U.S. markets in six straight sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1616, the high from May 3.
In a closely-watched speech in Brussels, Draghi lashed into politicians throughout the euro zone for helping stall economic reforms while furthering their own political agendas. Specifically, Draghi noted that the European Central Bank is doing a large portion of the heavy lifting on its own with little help from top political leaders in terms of enacting the proper fiscal policies. Draghi, the president of the ECB, made the comments on Thursday at the Fifth Annual Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa Lecture at the Brussels Economic Forum.
""There are many understandable political reasons to delay structural reform, but there are few, very few, good economic ones,” Draghi said. “The cost of delay is simply too high.""
Draghi's comments came one day after the ECB launched a comprehensive corporate bond program, the latest tool at its disposal to help bolster persistently low inflation. The bonds will be limited to investment-grade securities, according to the ECB, which are euro denominated and issued in the euro zone. The ECB is expected to release a list of participating corporations later next month.
Yields on the Germany 10-Year slumped to an all-time record-low of 0.028%, before rebounding slightly to 0.03, down two basis points on the session. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell two basis points to 1.69%. During an extended yield rout, both U.S. and German 10-year yields have plunged more than 75 basis points over the last year.
Elsewhere, Bloomberg reported that billionaire investor George Soros has taken a more active role in his family's trading activity, amid emerging headwinds facing the global economy. Later, in an exclusive interview with the Wall Street Journal, Soros cited a plethora of concerns weighing on the current economic outlook including: China's debt-ridden economy, persistent economic struggles in Greece, the ongoing euro area migration crisis and the potential of a Brexit departure from the European Union in a controversial referendum in two weeks.
As a result, investors piled into safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen on Thursday. USD/JPY fell more than 0.25% to an intraday-low of 106.25, its lowest level on the month. Since closing May above 110, the dollar has crashed nearly 4% against the yen.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 94.11 before closing near session-highs. The index has crashed by more than 5% since early-December.
Foreign exchange traders await the completion of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting next week for further indications on potential divergence between the Fed and the ECB. The Fed has left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at each of its first three meetings this year.
Any rate hikes by the Fed in 2016 are viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors look to capitalize on higher yields from the greenback.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2016 09:20AM ET</span>",Crisis-era red flag from dollar FX market flies high again,"By Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - A shortage of dollars and high demand for the currency globally are stretching certain dollar-based rates to levels more associated with periods of extreme market stress, raising a red flag for the wider financial system. 
Record-low investment returns are forcing investors in the euro zone and Japan to buy U.S. bonds, which is having the negative and potentially costly effect of depressing U.S. yields and the profitability of the country's banks. 
On the surface, banks are in far healthier shape now than at any time since the 2008 financial crash and recession. But strains in the cross currency basis markets, particularly the Japanese yen, is giving central bankers food for thought. 
The Bank for International Settlements has twice warned in the last month about the risks to global financial stability posed by ""anomalies"" in currency markets resulting from the dollar's rise over the last two years.
These anomalies have come under particular scrutiny in recent weeks as the dollar's rally has eased off. But instead of pulling back in tandem, the premium for dollar funds in the FX basis market has continued to rise.
FX basis, effectively the cost of swapping one currency into the other without the exchange rate risk, are a measure of the scarcity of one currency relative to another. In benign markets, they will show virtually no premium for one over others.
Multinational corporations who need dollars for financing purposes, or more sophisticated investors wanting to take advantage of the interest rate differentials, are typically those involved in the FX basis markets.
Demand for dollars during the 2007-08 financial crisis pushed that premium to record levels far above the norm, reflecting the unprecedented stress in the system.
Trillions of dollars of central bank liquidity and years of zero - and even negative - interest rates have brought that risk premium down, but it remains significant. And negative yields in the euro zone and Japan are in large part to blame. 
Stuart Sparks, a rates strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York, says the demand for higher yielding U.S. assets from the euro zone and Japan is causing ""market dislocations"" and could depress the profitability of U.S. banks over time.
""This is lowering asset returns available to U.S. banks and U.S. net interest margins. And at a time of higher capital requirements, it's a concern,"" Sparks said.
The value of U.S. bank stocks has fallen 4 percent so far this year (BKX), underperforming Wall Street's broader indices, which are up 4 percent. 
CURVE FLATTENING
The three-month dollar/yen currency basis is trading at -75 basis points, signifying a 75 bps premium for dollar funding over comparable yen borrowings. The basis was around -60 bps or more for most of this year, and neared -100 bps in late 2011.
The three-month euro/dollar currency basis is trading around -38 basis points, the most deeply negative this year. But it was double that late last year, reached -160 bps at the height of the euro zone crisis in late 2011, and -300 bps in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed.
While far short of these extreme levels, the premium for dollars now, eight years after the financial crisis, is notable. Pre-crisis, euro and dollar funding costs were virtually equal.
A reflection of the rising demand for dollar funds can be seen in the surge in dollar-denominated debt issuance from Japanese firms this year. A total $29.8 billion has been issued, up 70 percent from the same period last year and the highest in over a decade, according to Thomson Reuters data.
According to Fitch Ratings, over $10 trillion of government debt around the world offer negative yields, almost entirely in the euro zone and Japan. All euro zone yields out to nine years and Japanese yields out to 10 years are below zero.
This has contributed to a dramatic flattening of yield curves, not only in the euro zone and Japan but also in the United States.
The difference between 10- and two-year U.S. yields is around 90 basis points, meaning the yield curve is its flattest since 2007. Banks prefer steep yield curves because it means they can profit from borrowing short-term funds cheaply and lending long term at higher rates.
The Japanese and euro zone curves are even flatter. Japanese and euro zone financial stocks this year are down 30 percent <.TRXFLDJPPBANK> and 20 percent, respectively, pushing investors into U.S. markets. 
But rising dollar funding costs could force banks to get dollars from less conventional sources, such as the dollar swap lines between the Federal Reserve and other central banks opened up in the aftermath of the crisis. 
""Some of the basis levels we are now seeing have gone beyond the point where dollar lending facilities provided by central banks have been taken by investors in the past,"" said Fabio Bassi, head of European Rates Strategy at JP Morgan in London.

""With some of these facilities already in place, I would give it less than a 50 percent probability to a more active policy response from central banks.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A 1.5 percent surge for the New Zealand dollar after interest rates there were kept on hold was by far the biggest move in major currency markets on Thursday, while the U.S. dollar hit a five-week low against the yen. 
The Reserve Bank surprised some investors who had been betting on a rate cut and its concerns over rising house prices and emerging inflationary pressures cooled expectations that the bank will cut soon. 
While growth remains shaky and price growth extremely low, along with its Australian and Canadian counterparts, the kiwi dollar has been steadily recovering since reaching long-term lows in January of this year. 
In early European trade it was up 1.4 percent at $0.7121, off a high of $0.7148 hit in Asian time.
""The kiwi went on a rampage after the RBNZ kept rates on hold,"" said Tobias Davis, head of corporate treasury sales at Western Union in London. 
""Governor Wheeler's comments centred around data being a decision driver, inflation expectations anchoring and the fact that strong property prices were a cause for concern. We think downside risks remain, along with the chance of a cut in August.""
The big developed world foreign exchange markets have been struggling for direction this week after the U.S. dollar saw its worst day in six months on the back of shockingly poor jobs numbers last Friday. 
The index that tracks the U.S. currency's strength against a basket of its peers has fallen every day this week, but the losses have been limited and it was all but flat on Thursday. 
Still, expectations for further rises this year in Federal Reserve interest rates are back near rock bottom, along with expectations for global growth, and the dollar was down half a percent to 106.32 yen by 0730 GMT.
""Dollar-yen has traded in a broad 105–111 range over the past two months as markets continuously reassess the timing of Fed rate hikes,"" analysts from UBS Wealth Management said in a note. 
They argued increased hedging of FX exposure by major Japanese pension funds would weigh on any rebound for the dollar, seeing the dollar stabilising at or around 110 yen over the next 12 months if the Fed does gradually raise rates.
""A bigger rebound cannot be ruled out, but will likely be met with hedging activities,"" they said.

In the euro area, yields on corporate bonds moved lower as the ECB started a highly-anticipated corporate sector asset purchasing program, in its latest attempt to stave off deflation. The bonds will be limited to investment-grade securities, according to the ECB, which are euro denominated and issued in the euro zone. It is estimated that the market for such bonds is around €500 and €600 billion, consisting primarily of debt from major corporations in France and the Netherlands.
Also on Wednesday, ECB Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau outlined the potential ramifications of lowering interest rates deeper into negative territory. In March, the ECB slashed its deposit rate even further by charging banks 0.4% to hold cash overnight. Last week, the ECB held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of zero.
""Not all unconventional instruments are legitimate. There are limits on how negative interest rates can go,"" Villeroy de Galhau said during an appearance in Berlin. ""This type of unconventional measure, although useful, should be used with care.""
Yields on the Germany 10-year remained flat at 0.05%, while yields on the U.S. 10-year dropped one basis point to 1.70%. On Tuesday, yields on German bunds fell to an all-time record low of 0.04%.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS that the rate of hiring fell to 3.5% in April from 3.7% in March. It marked the lowest level since August, 2014. At the same time, job openings nationwide increased by 118,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.79 million, the highest amount in 11 months. The job openings rate rose slightly by 0.1 to 3.9%.
The subdued hiring figures come on the heels of a dismal U.S. monthly employment report last week when the Labor Department reported that the  economy added 38,000 in May, the fewest number of monthly jobs in nearly six years. The downbeat report provided an unexpected shock to the labor market, which added an average of 200,000 jobs per month last year – one of the highest annual totals since the Great Recession. On Monday, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen attempted to soothe markets by downplaying the significance of a single report. 
Yellen's comments, however, have done little to convince market players that the Fed could resume tightening in the coming months. The chances of a July rate hike, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool, stood at 24.8% on Wednesday, down from 30.0% a month earlier. The market also sees practically no chance of a rate hike next week when the FOMC convenes for the two-day meeting next week. The current probability of a June rate hike fell to 1.9% on Tuesday from 3.8% during the previous day.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.35% to an intraday low of 93.41 before rallying to 93.59 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading. The index has crashed by more than 5% since early-December.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a five-week low against a basket of currencies on Wednesday as traders reduced bets of an imminent U.S. interest rate increase following a poor jobs report and perceived dovish comments from the Federal Reserve chief.
The euro reached a near four-week peak against the greenback even with German Bund yields posting record lows as the European Central Bank began buying corporate debt for its bond purchase program in a bid to boost the euro zone economy. 
Stronger-than-expected Chinese import data boosted the Australian and New Zealand dollars and other commodity-sensitive currencies versus the greenback.
""With Fed rate expectations collapsing precipitously over the past week thanks to Friday's abhorrent May labor market report, investors have been quick to recalibrate to the reality that the Fed liftoff isn't coming until at least September, but more likely December,"" said Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX in New York.
On Monday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen gave an upbeat view on the U.S. economy but refrained from offering a possible timing on a rate increase.
U.S. interest rate futures implied traders saw nearly no chance the Fed would increase rates at its policy meeting next week , according to CME Group's FedWatch.

Meanwhile, the greenback weakened 0.4 percent to 106.86 yen , holding above a 4-week low set earlier this week. It pared initial losses after data showed that China's imports beat forecasts in May, adding to hopes that the world's second-biggest economy may be stabilizing.
The encouraging Chinese data spurred buying of oil, metal and other commodities, which in turn lifted the currencies of those exporting countries.

The Australian dollar  approached a five-week peak at $0.7473, up 0.2 percent on the day, while the New Zealand dollar  rose 0.5 percent at $0.7015, not far below a five-week high set earlier on Wednesday.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2016 04:06AM ET</span>",Waning Fed rate hike expectations push dollar index to five-week lows,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a five-week trough against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, hurt by waning expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates anytime soon.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rivals, edged down 0.1 percent to 93.740 after dropping as low as 93.68, its lowest since May 6.
Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar slipped 0.25 percent to 107.15 yen, after hitting a low of 106.72 earlier. It climbed from those lows after data showed that China's imports beat forecasts in May, adding to hopes that the economy may be stabilising.
Nevertheless, traders are convinced the dollar will struggle to gain higher ground unless incoming data beats expectations. Investors have almost priced out the chance of a rate increase at the Fed Reserve's June 14-15 policy review, and reduced the likelihood of a July rate hike to around 26 percent.
With worries about Brexit also gathering, investors are uncertain whether the Fed will raise rates in the near term. 
""The dollar continues to remain soggy with June priced out and chances that the Fed will move in July waning. Investors will need some good payrolls data and signs of inflation picking up, before they are convinced that a rate hike in September is on the cards,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen did not specify whether the Fed will raise rates over the summer months.
That kept pressure on the dollar which had weakened substantially after the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday showed the slowest job growth in more than five years in May, quashing expectations for a hike during the summer. 
""A June U.S. rate hike is now out of the question and the focus is whether the Fed provides any hints of a July hike. There are no major U.S. indicators until the Fed's policy meeting next week, and the dollar is likely to remain bearish until then,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, forex analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
The dollar's weakness saw the euro gain 0.2 percent to $1.1375. It had closed the past two days virtually flat after its 2 percent surge on Friday with investors not very keen to buy the single currency amid worries that the euro zone is likely to struggle if Britain votes to leave the European Union.

Speculation over whether Britain will remain in the EU or not at a referendum on June 23 continued to sway the pound. Sterling was steady at $1.4545 after having gained roughly 0.8 percent on Tuesday after two polls gave a narrow lead to the ""Remain"" camp.

The currency pair traded between 1.1339 and 1.1380, before settling at 1.1357, up 0.02% on the session. EUR/USD has traded in a tight range in each of the last three sessions since surging nearly 2% last Friday after disappointing U.S. employment data increased the possibility that the Fed could take a June interest rate hike off the table. With the recent rally, the euro has nearly erased all of its losses from May's swoon when it fell from 9-month highs versus its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1616, the high from May 3. 
Volume on foreign exchange markets on Tuesday was light in response to Yellen's final public comments before next week's critical Fed meeting. Addressing a luncheon audience at a World Affairs Council event in Philadelphia on Monday, Yellen omitted any reference to the timing of the Fed's next interest rate hike. Yellen's stance represented a shift from her position less than two weeks ago when she sent strong indications that the Fed appeared ready to resume tightening of its monetary policy cycle.
Following last December's historic interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its three meetings this year. Yellen's comments in late-May appeared to suggest that the FOMC could be ready to raise short-term interest rates on multiple occasions before the end of the year, as the labor market and inflation showed signs of firming. At its FOMC meeting in March, the committee's median projections forecasted the potential for two rate increases of 25 basis points each in 2016.
But last week the domestic labor market suffered an unforeseen shock when the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the economy added 38,000 in May, the fewest number of monthly jobs in nearly six years. While maintaining her signature calm disposition, Yellen downplayed the unsettling developments arguing that it is not constructive to attach too much significance to one report. Yellen also emphasized that a potential ""leave"" vote by U.K. voters in a controversial June 23 referendum could pose serious repercussions to the world economy.
Yellen's comments have done little to sway market sentiments. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool lowered the probability of a July rate hike to 24.8% on Tuesday from 25.8% one session earlier. The market sees virtually no chance of a rate hike next week when the FOMC convenes for the two-day meeting on June 14-15. The current probability of a June rate hike fell to 1.9% on Tuesday from 3.8% during the previous day.
Market players continued to pile into safe-haven assets, ahead of the launch of the European Central Bank's corporate bond-buying program on Wednesday. In Tuesday's session, yields on theGermany 10-Year fell more than four basis points to an all-time record low of 0.04% before settling at 0.05%. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year, meanwhile, fell two basis points to 1.72%, remaining near 1-month lows. Over the last year, government bond yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries and German bunds have each plummeted by more than 65 basis points.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Australian dollar strengthened on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates on hold and hinted it was in no hurry to ease monetary policy further on signs of reasonably strong economic growth.
Sterling recovered further from three-week lows versus the dollar  set on Monday following two newspaper polls on Tuesday that showed Britons narrowly favor remaining in the European Union. The results were in contrast to surveys released on Monday which showed more voters favored leaving the EU.
The dollar hovered near four-week lows against a basket of currencies as traders speculated when the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates in the wake of comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Monday and a poor May jobs report on Friday.
The RBA as expected kept the cash rate at a record low 1.75 percent, after cutting last month for the first time in a year.
""It suggests a patient RBA. It doesn't mean an immediate cut in rates following the one in May,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Limited in New York.
Many traders were disappointed that the RBA statement offered no hints on further easing, which led them to exit earlier bets on an imminent rate cut, sending the Aussie higher.
The Aussie was the biggest gainer among major currencies, hitting $0.7458, its highest since May 6 . It rose nearly 1 percent against the yen and the euro (EURAUD=) (AUDJPY=). 
Sterling also posted strong gains, rising 1 percent at $1.4574  after hitting a three-week low on Monday on worries about the outcome of the June 23 ""Brexit"" referendum.
Investors and policy-makers have warned a British exit from the EU would hurt the global economy and roil financial markets.
Tuesday's poll results soothed some fears, but uncertainty remained high.
The pound's one-month volatility against the U.S. dollar  has surged to its highest since early 2009 during the global credit crisis, Reuters data showed. 
On the other hand, the dollar was subdued after Fed Chair Yellen on Monday did not specify whether the Fed would raise rates in the coming months. 
The dollar index (DXY) was marginally lower at 93.874, holding above a near four-week trough of 93.745 set on Monday. 

The greenback tumbled on Friday when the May U.S. nonfarm payrolls report showed the slowest job growth in more than five years in May, quashing expectations for a near-term rate hike.

""As I said, the positive economic forces have outweighed the negative, and despite the challenges that the economy continues to face, I continue to expect further progress toward our employment and inflation objectives,"" Yellen said.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.20% to an intraday high of 94.27 before settling at 94.03. The index has tumbled more than 5% since early-December."

The dollar has benefited from hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials in recent weeks, which seemed to suggest a summer interest rate hike was imminent.
This week's sentiment data, however, did not cover Friday's dismal U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, which all but ruled out a rate hike later this month.
Traders are currently pricing in just a 4% chance for a rate hike this month, down from 21% late last week, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
According to the report, 50.6% of market participants held long positions in USD/JPY in the week ended June 3, rising from 48.8% a week earlier.
Meanwhile, 32.5% of investors held long positions in EUR/USD as of last week, falling from 35.6% in the preceding week, 38.1% of investors were long GBP/USD, compared to 37.4% in the previous week, while 45.9% of investors were long USD/CHF, increasing from 42.8%.
Amongst the commodity-linked currencies, 41.0% were long USD/CAD, declining from 44.7% a week earlier, 42.8% held long positions in AUD/USD, compared to 42.5% in the preceding week, while 38.4% were long NZD/USD, down from 48.2% a week earlier.

Elsewhere, 32.1% of investors were long the S&P 500, dropping sharply from 54.7% a week earlier.
A reading between 50%-70% is bullish for the instrument, a reading between 30% and 50% is bearish, a reading above 70% indicates overbought conditions and a reading below 30% indicates oversold conditions.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Monday, having hit a more than three-week lows against a basket of major currencies after a poor employment report prompted investors to rule out the chance of a hike in U.S. interest rates in June.
The dollar index (DXY) rose 0.2 percent to 94.246, having hit a low of 93.855 on Friday - a level last seen on May 12. It tumbled 1.6 percent on Friday, posting its second biggest one-day drop this year.
Friday's data showed nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the fewest in more than 5-1/2 years, confounding forecasts for a rise of 164,000 jobs.
Investors have almost priced out the chance of a rate increase at the Fed Reserve's June 14-15 policy review, and reduced the likelihood of a July rate hike to around 30 percent from around 60 percent.
With worries about Brexit also gathering, investors are increasingly uncertain whether the Fed will raise rates in the near term. 
Many traders suspect Federal Chair Janet Yellen, who is due to speak on economic outlook and monetary policy to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 1630 GMT, will craft her message to keep expectations for a July hike alive.
""Rate hike expectations for June have disappeared. And while the focus has shifted to July, we expect the dollar to be rather subdued this week, with not much of economic data out of the U.S.,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura.
""Dollar/yen should trade in a 105-110 yen range while the euro will be in a $1.10-$1.15 range.""
Against the yen, the dollar slid to a one-month low of 106.35  on Friday, before bouncing back to trade 0.6 percent higher at 107.22 yen on Monday, thanks to bargain-hunting after its big fall on Friday.
With the yen near its 18-month peak of 105.55 hit in early May, some traders are getting wary of threats of intervention from Japanese authorities.
""We are close to the 105 handle, where Finance Minister (Taro) Aso talked about intervention last time. So there is a certain degree of cautiousness,"" said a trader at a major Japanese bank.
Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, Masatsugu Asakawa, on Monday stuck to his usual comments that he was closely watching movements in currency markets.
The euro fell 0.2 percent against the dollar having climbed to its highest in three weeks at $1.1375  on Friday. Worries about Britain leaving the European Union were dragging the single currency lower against the dollar, traders said.
Sterling fell more than 1 percent to a three-week low against the dollar after two polls published at the weekend pointed to the ""Leave"" camp edging ahead of the June 23 vote on whether Britain will stay in the European Union or not.

The pound was 0.9 percent lower at $1.4375  after having fallen to as low as $1.4352, its lowest since May 16.

On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said nonfarm payrolls in May rose by 38,000, less than a quarter of analysts' expectations for monthly job gains of 158,000. It marked the slowest monthly job growth since September, 2010 and raises questions on the strength of the broader economy following a downwardly revised total of 123,000 in April. As a result, the three-month average which hovered near 200,000 early this spring, crashed to 116,000.
The losses were concentrated among the information sector, which fell by 34,000, reflecting the six-week strike involving Verizon union workers that was settled last week. The manufacturing industry remained weak, losing 10,000 positions on the month, while jobs in the construction sector fell by 15,000, one month after spending in the industry dipped by the largest amount in five years. In addition, jobs in the temporary help services category, a leading indicator of future job growth, fell by 21,000.
At the same time, the unemployment rate  dropped by 0.2% to 4.7%, as an estimated 500,000 Americans left the workforce last month. The labor force participation rate inched down 0.2% to 62.6%, while average hourly wages rose by 0.2% on the month. The average work week held steady at 34.4 hours.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Last December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Shortly after the jobs release, Fed governor Lael Brainard called the results of the employment report ""sobering,"" and warned her colleagues against moving too fast by approving a premature rate hike. Last Friday, Fed chair Janet Yellen sent strong indications that the FOMC could raise rates in the coming months barring an unexpected economic setback. The FOMC meets next on June 14-15, ahead of a controversial Brexit referendum on the U.K.'s status in the European Union.
""In this environment, prudent risk management implies there is a benefit to waiting for additional data to provide confidence that domestic activity has rebounded strongly and reassurance that near-term international events will not derail progress toward our goals,"" Brainard said in a speech before the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington.
Yellen could address the state of the U.S. labor market and its implications on the Fed's monetary policy decisions when she delivers a speech to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia on Monday.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, crashed more than 1.5% to a three-week low of 93.97. The index has tumbled more than 6% since early-December.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year tumbled 11 basis points to an intraday-low of 1.697%, their lowest level in three weeks, before settling at 1.70%. Meanwhile, yields on the Germany 10-Year fell more than five basis points to an all-time record low of 0.068%.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY fell more than 2% to an intraday-low of 106.51, its lowest level in nearly a month. GBP/USD gained 0.73% to 1.4529, while USD/CAD fell 1.19% to 1.2942, suffering its worst one-day loss in nearly two months."

87,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2016 06:30AM ET</span>","Separate banknotes symbols of Libyan disunity, financial disarray","By Aidan Lewis
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - After a plane-load of Russian-printed banknotes landed in eastern Libya this week, residents rushed to collect long-delayed salaries. In Tripoli, where notes dispatched from Britain are yet to be distributed, people queued in vain to withdraw cash. 
The separate deliveries have created more confusion in Libya, alongside warnings that efforts by a U.N.-backed government to unite the country and rescue its failing economy could be undermined. 
Resolving an acute liquidity crisis is seen as key to the success of the Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been struggling for two months to establish itself in Tripoli and to make its presence felt on the ground. 
Residents in the west say they have seen no improvement in their daily lives, while eastern officials have pushed to ease financial difficulties independently, trying unsuccessfully to export their own oil and ordering 4 billion Libyan dinars ($3 billion) of fresh currency supplies.
The GNA is meant to replace two rival governments set up in Tripoli and the east in 2014. The eastern government was recognized internationally, but its attempts to wrest control of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) have been blocked.
""We asked many printing houses to print for us but nobody accepted. That's why we went to the Russians,"" said Ali Jehani, a senior central bank official in the eastern city of Bayda. ""We could not wait any longer because the economic situation was getting worse in the east.""
DEEP RECESSION
Libya's economy has been deteriorating rapidly. It used to be one of Africa's wealthiest nations, but conflict and political anarchy after the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi five years ago have wrecked the oil exports that provide nearly all its income.
Revenue from oil sales is down to about 15 percent of its 2013 level, while bloated public wage and import bills led to budget and current account deficits of around 75 percent in 2015, according to the World Bank. Foreign reserves plunged from $108 billion in 2013 to $57 billion by the end of last year.
The value of the Libyan dinar on the black market is about a third of its official rate.
Living standards have tumbled and prices soared, with the cost of bread up fivefold last year alone. Some 1.3 million of Libya's 6.3 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations. 
Tripoli seems relatively normal, its roads congested and new shops and restaurants even opening in some neighborhoods.
But salary payments have been delayed for months and banks have strictly limited withdrawals, leading to queues that sometimes start forming overnight. Last month there was a stampede at one bank and several people were shot dead by guards.
Economists say there is plenty of money in circulation, but people keep it at home because they have no trust in the banks.
Frustration at the GNA, whose leaders are still operating out of a heavily secured naval base on Tripoli's seafront, has grown as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan approaches.
""The prime minister lied to us – he told us everything would be fine and then he left us."" said Walid Aguileh, a soldier standing in line outside a Tripoli bank. ""What's he doing by the sea while we're here queuing?""
MISTRUST
The central bank offices in Tripoli in the west and Bayda in the east both say they are acting neutrally to relieve the crisis, and that their new banknotes will be distributed across the country.
The Bayda office has already delivered some of the 200 million dinars that arrived on Tuesday to eight commercial banks in the east, as well as to southern regions, Jehani said. It is expecting to deliver to western Libya next week and is in ""full cooperation"" with the central bank's issuing department in Tripoli.
The central bank in the capital, which has ordered 1 billion dinars printed in Britain, said a consignment of 112 million dinars that landed on Wednesday would be delivered to ""banks in all Libyan cities, without exception"".
But mistrust runs deep. Jehani said the eastern central bank had been forced to act because over the past 18 months the east had received less than half of what it should have in payments from Tripoli. 
The central bank in Tripoli has aligned itself with the GNA, which issued a statement last week saying the distribution of Russian-printed notes could lead to political division, a collapse of the currency, and hyper inflation - though a leaked internal letter later appeared to show the GNA was prepared to accept the move.
Western diplomats are also critical. The U.S. embassy said it shared GNA concerns the Russian-printed banknotes ""would be counterfeit and could undermine confidence"" in Libya's currency and the CBL's ability to manage monetary policy.
""I hope that this issue of money does not lead to the division of the country,"" said Benghazi resident Moataz al Oraibi, who said salaries were unpaid for 4 months. ""But if the situation we're facing continues, the country will be split and we will pay the price.""

90,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2016 04:04AM ET</span>",Euro near three-year low vs yen on bets of more ECB easing,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro traded close to a three-year low against the yen on Friday, weakened after the European Central Bank failed to lift its long-term forecasts, raising the prospect of yet more monetary easing.
Though the ECB did adjust its 2016 inflation forecast by 0.1 percentage points, it left its 2017 and 2018 projections unchanged, despite a fresh round of easing having been announced and oil prices having risen since the last time the central bank set its forecasts.
The bank also cut its outlook for underlying inflation and lowered its forecast for consumption and government consumption, suggesting persistent slack in the economy.
The euro fell to 121.065 yen after the ECB's press conference, its weakest since April 2013. On Friday it was just above that low at 108.73 yen, down 0.1 percent on the day.
""The main takeaway for us ... from the press conference was the fact that (ECB President Mario) Draghi didn't dismiss out of hand the idea of more easing in the future,"" said Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's European head of global markets research in London, Derek Halpenny.
""It was the first indication that ... we're going to get some form of tapering timetable announced later this year - some kind of further easing measures,"" he added.
The dollar was weaker against most currencies, with investors cautious ahead of a key U.S. non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT that should provide clues as to whether an interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve in either June or July is feasible.
The market consensus is for the U.S. economy to have created 164,000 jobs in May, little changed from April.
""There's an uneasy feeling whenever markets make big moves lately, but there is no particular reason to take significant long positions in dollar or yen until we see the jobs data,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The greenback hit a two-week low of 108.50 yen, but was flat against the euro at $1.11535.
The safe-haven yen has been lifted this week by subdued risk appetite, which is expected to persist in the run-up-to Britain's referendum on its membership of the European Union on June 23.
The yen has also climbed on scepticism that the Bank of Japan would act on warnings that it would step in to weaken the currency if it became too strong.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2016 08:10PM ET</span>",The chase is on as investors find creative ways to bet against yuan,"By Nathaniel Taplin
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investors are piling up bets to profit from a fall in the Chinese currency with a variety of creative strategies, raising the risk of a fresh bout of yuan volatility that churned global markets just a few months ago.
Rising expectations that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates in June or July have already put many other currencies under pressure. The yuan fell 1.5 percent in May, its sharpest monthly drop, excluding August when the currency was devalued, leaving it near levels last trade in 2011.
Investors expecting the currency to keep falling are adopting tactics to stay beyond the clutches of China's central bank. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) intervened heavily in onshore and offshore markets last year and early this year to try to force speculators out of the yuan market.
The strategies include fake invoicing of imports and exports to build up dollars offshore, buying the cyber currency Bitcoin and taking up short positions in Hong Kong stocks (HSI) (HSCE), which are closely correlated to the dollar/yuan exchange rate .
A yuan slide would offer some respite to China's exporters but would also raise uncomfortable memories for investors and policymakers alike of last year, when a stock market crash and a fall in the yuan prompted a wave of capital outflows from China and unprecedented intervention by authorities.
Since China devalued the yuan in August and permitted a further sharp slide in January, the currency has largely held steady.
It found some support from data suggesting the economy, which grew at a 25-year low in 2015, was picking up at the end of the first quarter. But subsequent data indicated growth was slipping again.
That combined with signs the U.S. Fed is gearing up to raise rates again has put renewed pressure on the yuan and sent investors scurrying for ways to profit from its slide.
WAYS TO BET AGAINST THE YUAN
The price of the web-based digital currency bitcoin, a popular way to move cash across borders, rose to its highest level in almost two years this week and trading volumes surged. Around 95 percent of bitcoin trading is on Chinese exchanges, industry sources say.
""Continued weakness in the yuan is prompting more adventurous Chinese speculators to see the bitcoin trade as a 'risky' flight to safety,"" said Charles Hayter, CEO of London-based digital currency analysis website CryptoCompare.
China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is conducting ""a rather intensive campaign"" to verify the authenticity of crude oil trade, said Zhang Xinyuan, the Shanghai branch manager of trade finance at the Bank of China.
SAFE ""has found many trades to be fake,"" Zhang said. SAFE declined immediate comment.
Fake invoicing has been a popular way for Chinese to skirt capital controls and shift money offshore.
Trading volumes in non-deliverable yuan forwards (NDFs), which offshore investors use to speculate on the yuan, have rebounded in recent weeks to their highest levels since December, Thomson Reuters data shows, although spreads against the spot rate are stable.
""The recent increase of volumes in NDFs reflect the changes in anticipation related to a potential Fed rate hike,"" says Karine Hirn, a Hong Kong based partner at the asset manager East Capital.
The NDF market sprang back into life this year after the offshore yuan market dried up following China's intervention.
Portfolio manager Shen Weizheng at Ivy Capital is shorting Hong Kong equities, which he says are highly correlated with the yuan's trend.
""A U.S rate rise would certainly put renewed pressure on the yuan, and have a huge impact on capital markets as well,"" he said.
KING DOLLAR
An estimated $674 billion flowed out of China last year, the Institute of International Finance, a global financial industry association, said in April. Although outflows have slowed down this year, they could accelerate again if fears emerge of a ""disorderly"" drop in the yuan, it said.
Some analysts have said the easing of capital outflows this year was less a reflection of the central bank's victory over speculators – the dominant view – and more that market pressure had eased after the Federal Reserve decided not to raise rates late last year.
""Beijing can claim little credit for calming the waters,"" Andrew Batson, China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing said in a note.
With Fed rate fever rising again, investors expect a steady fall in the yuan against the dollar.
Claire Dissaux, director of global economics and strategy at asset manager Millenium Global in London, expects the yuan to fall to 6.8-6.9 per dollar by the end of the year from a spot rate on Thursday of 6.58.
By the middle of next year, a Reuters poll showed analysts expect the rate to be around 6.75.
But a one-off devaluation like the one in August is seen as less likely, in part because of the global criticism that followed the move.

""As for the central bank, it wants to slowly build expectations and avoid another 'uncontrolled experiment' like we saw last year,"" says Raymond Yeung, head China economist at ANZ Bank in Hong Kong.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Harvard University graduate has been criminally charged with fraudulently causing almost $20 million of losses for clients after falsely touting her currency trading prowess and using new money to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors.
The U.S. Department of Justice charged Haena Park, a founder of Phaetra Capital GP and its predecessor Argenta Capital, with wire fraud and commodities fraud, according to a complaint filed on Thursday with U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Park, 40, of Manhattan, was also civilly charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, court papers show.
The defendant was arrested on Thursday morning and appeared in court later in the day, the Justice Department said. She was released on $150,000 bond.
Julia Gatto, a federal public defender representing Park, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Phaetra did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Prosecutors said Park solicited more than $23 million from investors between 2010 and 2016 by touting herself as an ""accomplished"" trader who had generated high-double-digit annual returns.
In fact, Park was a ""consistently unsuccessful"" trader who lost $19.5 million of the $20 million she invested in currencies and highly leveraged futures, returned $3 million to earlier investors in a ""Ponzi-like"" fashion and sent bogus account statements to investors to conceal her losses, prosecutors said.
Authorities said Park lied to National Futures Association examiners in an April 4 interview by representing that she traded only her own money and that Phaetra had not been soliciting business.
According to the SEC, Park's victims included friends, family and former Harvard classmates.
The defendant graduated from Harvard in 1998 with a degree in psychology, school records show.
Park faces up to 20 years in prison on the wire fraud charge and up to 10 years on the commodities fraud charge. She also faces possible criminal and civil fines.
The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v. Park, No. 16-mag-03503; SEC v Park, No. 16-04103; and CFTC v. Park, No. 16-04120.

98,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 02, 2016 06:37PM ET</span>",Manhattan trader accused of defrauding investors in $23 million scheme,"Investing.com -- The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged a currency trader with defrauding investors out of $23 million by misrepresenting her investment history, her use of investor funds and the profitability of her investments from her Manhattan-based hedge fund.
Haena Park, 40, allegedly touted profitable futures and foreign currency trading strategies when soliciting family, friends, former classmates at Harvard University and individuals connected to them, according to SEC filings. In turn, Park pooled investor funds and subsequently incurred heavy trading losses without alerting the investors to the actual extent of her losses. Over a seven-year period, beginning in January, 2010, Park raised more than $23 million from more than 20 individual investors, according to federal authorities, ostensibly for trading a wide range of securities including: equities, futures and foreign exchange transactions. For months, Park allegedly sent her investors monthly accounting statement that detailed fictitious profits from Phaetra Capital GP, LLC, while using new investor funds to make payments to her initial investors. 
“We allege that Park brazenly obtained investor money under false pretenses and compounded her egregious conduct by using phony monthly statements to convince some investors to significantly increase their investments based on fictitious positive returns,” said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office. 
Park is also facing criminal charges in U.S. federal court for commodities and wire fraud stemming from her alleged criminal actions in the scheme to defraud her investors. Park allegedly claimed that Phaetra Capital produced annualized returns of 48.9%, when in fact her trading results were ""consistently unsuccessful,"" according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
""It is alleged that Haena Park defrauded investors and covered up millions of dollars in financial losses with fake documents and lies that may devastate the financial security of these victims."" Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent In Charge Angel Melendez said in a statement. ""HSI and its El Dorado Task Force partners are committed to investigating those who seek to exploit vulnerabilities in the US Financial System.""
If convicted, Park faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $1 million on the commodities fraud charge. Park also faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 if she is convicted of the wire fraud charge."

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1145 and 1.1220 before settling at 1.1189, down 0.0033 or 0.29% on the session. The euro starts June on the heels of one of its worst months of the year, when it plunged more than 2.85% against the dollar, falling sharply from its level at the start of the month when it surged to nine-month highs above 1.16. Despite the recent declines, the euro is still holding onto considerable gains from the start of the year. Since opening the year at 1.08, the euro is up by more than 2.5% against its American counterpart year to date. EUR/USD has still closed under 1.12 in each of the last eight sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1434, the high from May 12.
In Vienna, the ECB's Governing Council left interest rates unchanged ahead of the launch of a highly-anticipated corporate bond buying program next week, as inflation continues to remain stubbornly low. ECB president Mario Draghi opened his press conference on Thursday by noting that the Governing Council expects interest rates to remain low for a lengthy period, but did not add whether it plans to extend a comprehensive quantitative easing program beyond next March. While Draghi left the possibility open for further easing measures, he reiterated the ECB's main goal is to make sure that long-term inflation returns back toward its targeted objective.
Economists from the ECB raised their growth forecasts in the euro area by 0.2 to 1.6% for 2016, while leaving their projection for 2017 growth unchanged at 1.7%.
""Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. As emphasized repeatedly by the Governing Council, and as again strongly echoed in both European and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European levels,"" Draghi said. ""Structural policies are essential, given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area. Structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries, although specific reform needs differ across the individual economies.""
The ECB's decision could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates when it meets next on June 14-15. Some hawkish members of the Fed have been hesitant to lift rates as the ECB and the Bank of Japan continue to maintain a negative interest rate policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by lifting rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Also in Vienna, OPEC ended its semi-annual meeting without reaching an agreement to cap its production ceiling. While Saudi Arabia pledged to resist the temptation of flooding global energy markets with a glut of supply, Iran offered few hints that it will slow production in the coming months. Crude prices have fallen sharply since OPEC allowed production to exceed 30 million barrels per day in November, 2014, leading to a prolonged rout in global oil prices. 
Investors await Friday's critical U.S. jobs report for further indications on the timing of the Fed's next rate hike. Analysts predict that the economy added 158,000 nonfarm payrolls in May, following modest gains of 160,000 a month earlier. The unemployment rate is expected to inch down by 0.1 to 4.9%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 95.58 before settling near session-highs at 95.56."

USD/JPY was down 0.55% at a two-and-a-half week low of 108.95.
Payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose by 173,000 last month, just below expectations for an increase of 175,000.
The economy created 166,000 jobs in April, whose figure was upwardly revised from a previously reported increase of 156,000.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending May 28 decreased by 1,000 to 267,000 from the previous week’s total of 268,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 270,000 last week.
But the yen remained supported after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tuesday he was planning to delay a scheduled sales tax hike amid ongoing weakness in the economy. He also announced plans to implement a fiscal stimulus package later this year.
The announcement raised speculation over a shift away from monetary easing by the Bank of Japan as a way to spur growth.
EUR/USD was little changed at 1.1191, off highs of 1.1220 hit earlier in the session.
 The European Central Bank said it was maintaining its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.0%, in line with market expectations.
ECB President Mario Draghi was set to hold a press conference shortly after the decision.
The dollar was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.24% at 1.4447, while USD/CHF held steady at 0.9885.
The pound’s gains were capped however, as the Markit U.K. construction purchasing managers' index fell to 51.2 from April’s reading of 52.0. Economists had expected an unchanged reading.
The report said that delay’s to client decision making ahead of the European Union membership referendum on June 23 had contributed to the slowdown.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were weaker, with AUD/USD down 0.69% at 0.7207 and with NZD/USD sliding 0.45% to 0.6787.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday that retail sales rose by 0.2% in April, disappointing expectations for a 0.3% gain, after an increase of 0.4% the previous month.
A separate report showed that Australia’s trade deficit narrowed to A$1.58 billion in April from A$1.97 billion in March. Analysts had expected the trade deficit to widen to A$2.00 billion in April.
Elsewhere, USD/CAD rose 0.29% to trade at 1.3112.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 95.33, off lows of 95.15 hit earlier in the day.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2016 08:20AM ET</span>","Canadian dollar to dip near-term as economy weakens, Fed hikes: Reuters poll","By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is expected to weaken in the near-term on prospects of slower economic growth and a U.S. interest rate hike this month or next, a Reuters poll found, but an eventual oil price recovery is set to bolster the currency over the longer term.
The currency has fallen nearly 5 percent since reaching a 10-month high at C$1.2461 on May 3 as economic data turned sour after a strong start to the year. Meanwhile, wildfires disrupted oil production in Alberta, and speculation has increased that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this summer.
The Canadian dollar is likely to weaken against the greenback ""if the Fed really is in play here,"" said Scotiabank Chief Currency Strategist Shaun Osborne.
He expects events, such as a June 23 British referendum on whether to leave the European Union, to increase currency volatility. [GBP/POLL]
The Reuters poll showed the Canadian dollar weakening to C$1.3140 in a month from Wednesday's close of 1.3075, recovering to C$1.3000 in six months and trading there in a year, matching the 12-month forecast in May.
A more sluggish economy is likely to contribute to near-term weakness in the currency.
""Even before the Alberta wildfires, we were looking for a slowdown in Canadian economic growth in (the second quarter) after a surprisingly strong start to the year,"" said RBC Capital Markets Chief Technical Strategist George Davis.
The Bank of Canada kept interest rates on hold last week, saying the economy would shrink in the second quarter because of the wildfires and then rebound later in the year.
After raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December, economists expect the Fed to hike again in September, a Reuters poll found, while the market has been increasing bets that it will happen this summer. [ECILT/US]
""The Canadian dollar ... is likely to soften over the medium term as the Federal Reserve does actually resume that rate hike cycle,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, Wells Fargo's head of currency strategy. 
In contrast, the Bank of Canada is likely to hold policy steady until the third quarter of 2017, a Reuters survey of economists showed. Overnight index swaps imply a 16 percent chance of a rate cut this year. [CA/POLL]
Analysts expect return to full production for Alberta's oil sands and higher oil prices to help strengthen the currency later in the year. 

Oil market experts polled by Reuters earlier this week forecast U.S. crude futures (CLc1) would average $42 per barrel in 2016, up $1.50 from last month's poll. So far this year, they have averaged around $38. [O/POLL]

106,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2016 07:50AM ET</span>","Dollar set to rise in coming year, Fed in driver's seat: poll","By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar is set to rise over the coming year on revived expectations the Federal Reserve will follow through with an interest rate hike this summer, a Reuters poll showed, but only a slight majority say the rally will be ""significant.""
In recent weeks, better-than-expected data out of the U.S. have helped Fed officials, including Chair Janet Yellen, to talk the markets into pricing in a rate hike as early as July and pushed the dollar up against major currencies.
In line with that, currency speculators boosted their bets in favor of the dollar for the first time in six weeks, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
That should pressure the euro and keep the European Central Bank to stand pat on monetary policy at their meeting later on Thursday and for the rest of the year, as forecast in a separate Reuters poll published last week. [ECB/INT]
""The policy divergence trade is back with a vengeance and investors are scrambling to buy USD against other G10 currencies,"" wrote Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at CA-CIB.
But not everyone agrees on the magnitude. Just a slight majority, 37 of 68 strategists, expect a significant dollar rally. The remaining 31 do not.
The euro <EUR=> lost almost 3 percent last month, but the latest poll of over 70 strategists conducted over the past week put the single currency only slightly weaker at $1.11 in a month from $1.12 on Thursday. It is then expected to slip to $1.10 in six months and $1.09 in 12 months, where it started the year.
While those forecasts were little changed compared to last month's poll, the number of analysts calling for euro/dollar parity or lower over the coming year has fallen to just two compared with 15 at the start of 2016.
While most central banks nearly always say they don't target exchange rates, a weaker currency is crucial for the success of the ECB's and the Bank of Japan's current policies, since it helps to import inflation and makes exports more competitive.
But the various stimulus measures, including negative interest rates adopted by central banks, have had little of the desired effect on exchange rates so far this year.
That suggests any further weakness in those currencies will more likely be driven by the Fed and the currency on the other side of the exchange rate - the dollar.
""Hawkish Fedspeak suggests earlier tightening is likely. While surprising, this likely supports the dollar near-term,"" wrote Jeremy Hale, head of macro strategy at Citi.
The nearest-term risk to foreign exchange rates and indeed to global financial markets more broadly is whether Britain votes to stay in or leave the European Union on June 23. [GBP/POLL]
The other major risk is the U.S. Presidential election in November -- 33 of 52 analysts say their dollar forecasts are skewed to the downside in the run-up to that vote.
Still, with a stronger dollar view, analysts are sticking to a weaker yen outlook, despite the fact the yen rallied earlier this year when the Bank of Japan adopted negative rates.
The yen is forecast to weaken to 112 per dollar in three months and drop to 116 in a year from around 109 on Thursday, similar to predictions made last month.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2016 06:00AM ET</span>","China's yuan to weaken further as U.S. dollar rallies, economy cools: Reuters poll","By Sumanta Dey
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan is expected to weaken around 2.5 percent over the coming year as the dollar rallies on expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes and as China's central bank sets lower mid-points for its mostly-managed currency, a Reuters poll found.
The yuan posted its second-biggest monthly fall on record against the dollar in May, highlighting Beijing's willingness to allow its currency to weaken and reflecting a resurgent dollar as Federal Reserve policymakers put the prospect of a rate hike on the table as early as this month.
Concerns about China's opaque currency policy were one of the factors behind a global financial market rout at the start of the year when it deliberately weakened the yuan, leading investors to flee emerging markets fearing similar competitive devaluations by other central banks.
The yuan  has since stabilized and the PBoC has juggled its fixings both higher and lower to avoid speculation. It appeared to reverse course on Monday by setting the softest mid-point against the dollar since 2011, but then fixed the yuan higher on Thursday for the first time in four days. 
The median view from almost 60 currency analysts polled by Reuters this week is for the yuan to trade around 6.60 per dollar by end-June, slightly lower than 6.58 on Thursday.
It was expected to ease steadily to 6.69 by end-November and 6.75 by end-May 2017.
In last month's poll, the twelve-month consensus was 6.72.
""It's possible the acceleration of USD/CNY's upward pace reflects a short-term change of tack by Chinese officials seeking a weaker renminbi faster,"" said Sook Mei Leong, analyst at BTMU in Singapore.
""If so, that seems a risky game to play. The risk exists as we do not think officials have decisively addressed issues of economic weakness nor of troublesome debt and we'd advise watching capital outflows more carefully in the coming months.""
A separate Reuters poll last week showed pessimistic bets on the yuan were at its highest since early February, even as China's FX reserves rose in March and April, suggesting Beijing was easing off currency market interventions as outflows eased. [ASIA/FXP]
Chinese stocks are already the region's worst performers this year, down almost 20 percent, and concerns about the health of the world's second-largest economy will likely prove a drag on investments flowing into Asia.
Factory activity remained weak in May amid soft demand, suggesting a quick recovery is unlikely. While fears of a hard landing for the economy have ebbed, concerns about growing debt levels and systemic risks to the country's financial system have moved high up on investors' worry lists.
Hopes of further rate cuts by the PBoC have also faded amid lingering outflow concerns and signs that Beijing may be changing tack on its economic stimulus efforts, ramping up fiscal spending instead, including a flurry of major infrastructure projects.
In the absence of a shift in China's monetary policy, the Fed's policies will drive the yuan, as they will be the primary driver of most other currencies in the world, analysts said.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday that higher rates were appropriate in ""coming months"" if economic growth and the labor market keeps improving.
A majority of economists polled by Reuters last month said a hike would not come until September, but several policymakers have since weighed in to suggest rates are likely to rise this month or next, a risk backed up by minutes to the April meeting.
INDIA'S RUPEE MORE RESILIENT?
The Indian rupee , meanwhile, is expected to perform better despite a continued dollar rally.
The poll showed it would trade at 67.48 per dollar in one month, 68.17 by end November and 67.63 in a year. On Thursday it was around 67.30.
However, quite a few strategists predicted the rupee would fall below 68 per dollar in a year, with the most pessimistic view was at 71.66.
Yuna Park at Dongbu Securities said emerging currencies remained vulnerable to a Fed rate hike over the coming two months, but volatility won't be as intense this time around on expectations the Fed will move very gradually on rates.
That, she added, should help drive ""global money inflows into Indian assets.""
India gathered momentum from January to March to extend its lead as the world's fastest growing large economy, helping Prime Minister Narendra Modi craft an impressive sales pitch for meetings with investors in the United States next week.

Modi's pro-growth policies helped gross domestic product grow a faster-than-expected 7.9 percent year-on-year in the March quarter, faster than the December quarter's 7.2 percent.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2016 04:46AM ET</span>",Dollar hits two-week low against yen,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a two-week low against the safe-haven yen on Thursday, weighed down by uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June or July.
Strategists said comments from Bank of Japan board member Takehiro Sato, who said on Thursday he was opposed to deepening negative interest rates, had lifted the yen, which was already trading strongly on the back of subdued risk sentiment across markets.
The greenback strengthened to a two-month high against a basket of currencies at the start of the week, after Fed Chair Janet Yellen kept alive the possibility of a rate hike at this month's meeting. But it has since lost about 1 percent, with sceptical investors pricing in only a 20 percent chance of a hike in June, according to CME's FedWatch. 
The dollar was down half a percent by 0740 GMT at 108.99 yen, having earlier touched 108.825 yen, its lowest for two weeks. That was around 2.5 percent weaker than a one-month high of 111.455 yen set on Monday.
In London, BNY Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor said Sato's comments might have lifted the yen a little, but its strength had more to do with doubts over whether Japan would be willing to intervene to weaken the currency. 
""It's (Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe's worst nightmare,"" said Mellor. ""Despite all the efforts behind Abenomics... It's still an export-oriented economy, much to Abe's chagrin. What he wants is a weaker yen to buoy exports."" 
Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. manufacturing grew for a third straight month in May, but factories appeared to be taking in fewer deliveries from their suppliers, which could hamper production in the months ahead.
""While the U.S. ISM numbers yesterday were pretty good, there's still uncertainty over whether there will be an interest rate hike in June,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. 
The European Central Bank will at 1145 GMT publish its latest interest rate decision, with no change expected, followed by a press conference with ECB chief Mario Draghi at 1230 GMT.
The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1221, its highest in nine days, lifted by market expectations that the ECB will raise growth and inflation forecasts, a rare positive step even as it emphasises persistent negative risks and a readiness to provide more stimulus. 
""The immediate response in euro/dollar will depend on the impact of the ECB meeting on market risk sentiment,"" wrote  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) strategists in a research note. ""A potential weakening of risk appetite could trigger some short position squaring and help the euro."" 

After hitting a five-month low on Wednesday and having got within a whisker of a 5-1/2-year trough, the Chinese yuan edged up a touch to 6.5786 yuan per dollar in the onshore market.

EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1434, the high from May 12.
On Wednesday morning, the dollar suffered steady declines after the U.S. Commerce Department reported that construction spending plummeted 1.8% in April, recording its worst performance since January, 2011. Analysts expected to see an increase of 0.6% for the month. As a result, construction spending over the last year has slowed to 4.5% from 8% in March.
At the same time, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said that its Manufacturing Index for May ticked up 0.5 to 51.3, above consensus forecasts of 50.6. The positive reading could be a reflection of a five point jump in the delivery component, which could indicate stronger demand or severe delays in the supply chain. New orders, meanwhile, fell 0.1 to 55.7, while export orders remained unchanged at 52.5 remaining considerably above contraction.
Over the last two weeks, key policymakers from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have sent strong indications that they could raise short-term interest rates when they convene for a two-day meeting on June 14-15. The FOMC's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained steady at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Last Friday, Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a closely-watched appearance at Harvard University that it could be appropriate to raise rates in the near-term future if the economy and labor markets continue to show improvement.
Elsewhere, Markit said its euro area Manufacturing PMI index for May fell by 0.2 to 51.5, in line with consensus estimates. In Germany, Manufacturing PMI rose 0.3 to 52.1, but still fell below analysts' forecasts of 52.4.
The dollar also faced severe headwinds from the yen, after Japan prime minister Shinzo Abe rattled foreign exchange markets by delaying a steep sales tax increase by two and a half years until 2019. At the same time, Abe announced the government will unveil a fresh stimulus package at some point this fall, disrupting efforts to tackle one of the world's largest debts. As a result, USD/JPY fell more than 1% to an intraday low of 109.06, dropping to its lowest level in two weeks. Abe's government is proposing a tax hike of 2% from 8% to 10%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.45% to an intraday low of 95.34 before settling at 95.42. The index has tumbled by more than 4% since early-December when it hovered near 100."

Investors were turning their attention to Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for May for fresh indications on the strength of the labor market.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week it could be appropriate raise rates in the coming months if the economy and the labor market continue to pick up as expected, fueling expectations for a June rate hike.
The Fed hiked interest rates in December for the first time in almost a decade.
The dollar remained sharply lower against the yen, with USD/JPY down 1.19% at 109.37.

121,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2016 03:58AM ET</span>","Dollar drops against yen, investors pare June rate hike expectations","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the yen on Wednesday, pulling away from a one-month peak set at the start of the week, after soft U.S. data prompted investors to reconsider hopes about whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June or not.
Data released on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence dipped while a survey on business activity in U.S. Midwest also underwhelmed. That did not bode well for the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing survey due later in the day, with traders saying that a weak reading could see chances of a June rate hike recede further.
According to CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch programme, investors are pricing only a 22.5 percent probability of a rate move in June, down from around 32 percent factored in earlier in the week. Subdued risk sentiment and worries about whether Britain will vote to stay in the European Union or not later this month also buoyed the safe-haven yen.
The dollar shed 0.8 percent to 109.835 yen, weakening from Monday's peak of 111.455 yen, which had been the greenback's strongest level since late April. 
The yen's rise came on a day when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to formally announce a delay to a scheduled sales tax hike.
""There is some position adjustment taking place with the delay in the sales tax hike almost priced in by investors,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. ""Also for the dollar, the soft data is weighing and if the ISM manufacturing survey is below expectations, then we could see it having a negative impact on dollar/yen.""
Abe told members of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday that he will delay the tax by two and half years, the Kyodo news agency reported. The premier is due to hold a news conference at 0900 GMT.
Since a delay in the sales tax hike is widely expected, one focus is whether that will be accompanied by more fiscal spending and how that affects Tokyo shares and risk sentiment.
""The market is kind of looking at between 5-10 trillion yen,"" said Tan Teck Leng, FX strategist for UBS Wealth Management in Singapore, referring to expectations on the possibility of an extra Japanese budget.
If any supplementary budget were to come in at the lower end of expectations, there could be some disappointment, Tan added.
Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 95.70, pulling away from a two-month high of 95.968 set on Monday.
The Australian dollar pushed higher after the country's first-quarter growth exceeded market forecasts and prompted investors to scale back expectations for the Reserve Bank of Australia to lower rates soon.

128,By Investing.com,"<span>May 31, 2016 06:14PM ET</span>",EUR/USD falls slightly on Tuesday ending May sharply lower for the month,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell slightly on Tuesday closing the month broadly lower, even as mixed U.S. data did little to persuade the doves at the Federal Reserve that the economy has improved enough to necessitate an interest rate hike next month.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1122 and 1.1173 before settling at 1.1127, down 0.0021 or 0.17% on the session. For the month of May, the euro plummeted more than 2.85% against the dollar, falling sharply from its level at the start of the month when it surged to nine-month highs above 1.16. Despite the recent pullback, the euro is still holding onto considerable gains from the start of the year. Since opening the year at 1.08, the euro is up by approximately 2.5% over the first five months of 2016.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1434, the high from May 12.
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said its Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose by 0.3% in April, in line with consensus estimates. It came as consumer spending surged 1.0% on the month, considerably above a downwardly revised flat reading from March. At the same time, personal income increased by 0.4% on the month also line with analyst's forecasts.
The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, ticked up 0.2% from March's reading, one month after experiencing slight gains of 0.1%. On an annual basis, the core reading rose by 1.6% unchanged from the previous month. The Core PCE Index is the Fed's preferred gauge of long-term inflation. While inflation has firmed somewhat in recent months, it has stubbornly remained under the Fed's 2% targeted objective for the majority of the last three years.
There is currently a 20.6% probably the Fed will raise interest rates in June, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool, up from 11.3% a month earlier. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Some analysts believe the FOMC could wait until after a controversial Brexit vote on June 23 before approving its first rate hike of the year. Following the FOMC's July meeting, the CME Group says there is a 48.6% chance that the target range of the Fed Funds Rate will be between 0.50 and 0.75%, up from 26.0% a month ago.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
In the euro area, inflation in May fell by 0.1% on a yearly basis, extending losses from April when it inched down by 0.2%. It came as inflation in France dropped by 0.1% in May year-over-year, following similar 0.2% declines a month earlier. In Italy, meanwhile, inflation in May decreased by 0.3%, building on losses in April of 0.5% over the prior 12 months.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 95.89, before settling at 95.84. The index is still down by more than 4% since early-December"
129,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2016 12:43PM ET</span>",Dollar mostly flat as data fails to boost Fed rate hike bets,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was mostly flat against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday after U.S. economic data failed to support expectations for a June or July Federal Reserve interest rate hike. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last nearly unchanged at 95.564, down from a two-month high of 95.968 hit on Monday. The euro hit a session high of $1.1173, up from a more than 10-week low of $1.1096 hit on Monday. 
The dollar index remained on track for its biggest monthly increase in six months in May, of about 2.7 percent, boosted by a jump in expectations in recent weeks of a near-term Fed rate increase. The dollar was set for its biggest monthly gain against the yen  in 1-1/2 years, of about 4.3 percent. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in March. In the 12 months through April the core PCE rose 1.6 percent, matching its increase in March.
The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. Analysts said the latest reading, which they considered the most important economic data released on Tuesday, did not support bets on a June or July Fed rate hike by failing to show improvement or beat expectations. 
""We need a preponderance of U.S. data to beat expectations for rate hike expectations to increase,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
The Chicago Purchasing Management Index came in at 49.3 for May, below expectations for a rise to 50.7. That also weighed on the greenback. 
Analysts said comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Friday failed to continue supporting the dollar after pushing the dollar index to a two-month high. Yellen said a rate increase in coming months ""would be appropriate"" if the economy and labor market continue to improve.
The Fed's language has hedged against a near-term rate hike with provisos such as ""if"" or ""so long as,"" which has hurt investors' confidence in a June or July rate increase from the central bank, said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York.
He said traders were awaiting Friday's U.S. May employment report for greater clarity on Fed rate hike probabilities.

EUR/USD edged up 0.11% to 1.1149, moving back from the 10-week trough of 1.1097 set on Monday.

Personal income rose by 0.4%, in line with forecasts.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 95.78, holding below Monday’s two-month highs of 95.96.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after U.S. central bank chief Janet Yellen said late last week it could be appropriate for the Fed to raise rates in the coming months.
The Fed hiked interest rates in December for the first time in almost a decade.
Higher rates are positive for the dollar because they make the U.S. currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Investors were turning their attention to Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for May for fresh indications on the strength of the labor market.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar reached a two-month high against a basket of currencies and a one-month high against the yen on Monday, after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen fanned expectations the Fed would raise U.S. interest rates soon.
Political developments in Tokyo were also supporting the dollar against the yen. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would delay a sales tax increase scheduled for next April by two and a half years, a senior ruling party official said on Monday.
Japan is also expected to compile a supplementary budget to stimulate the sputtering economy, a move which is widely expected to be followed by further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, all of which undercut the yen. 
Volumes dwindled in Europe with both London and U.S. markets closed for public holidays.
The dollar rose above 111.00 yen for the first time since late April, reaching 111.455 yen in European trading, up 1 percent on the day. For the month, the dollar is on track for its best showing since late 2014 against the yen .
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.2 percent at 95.695 (DXY), while the euro recovered on slightly better than expected German inflation. The single currency had hit a 2 1/2-month low of $1.1097  in Asia, before recovering to trade at $1.1140, up 0.2 percent on the day.
Yellen said on Friday a rate increase in the coming months ""would be appropriate,"" if the economy and labour market continued to improve.
""Yellen's comments have raised the chances for a June or July rate hike, supporting the dollar,"" said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea, a large Nordic bank. ""A lot, though, will depend on the data that comes out this week. A good set of numbers will no doubt add to dollar strength.""
This week, U.S. non-farm payrolls and the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey are due. A solid employment report for May, due out on Friday, could heighten expectations for a June move and boost the dollar.  
""The dollar index can still move towards around 96.20 before sellers get tempted,"" said Jameel Ahmad, chief market analyst at FXTM.
As recently as early May, a Fed rate increase in June was off the agenda. But after a string of good data and the Fed officials' comments, the likelihood of a hike based on CME's Fedwatch has reached 28 percent.
Meanwhile, prospects for a delay in raising Japan's sales tax has boosted Japanese stocks and dimmed the appeal of the safe-haven yen, traders said.

A delay in raising the sales tax could shield the floundering economy, but it means less income for the cash-strapped government. That might lead rating agencies to downgrade Japan's sovereign rating.

The sale will take place on June 20-21 and involve 24,518 coins, said auction organizer financial services group Ernst and Young on Monday. 
U.S. Marshals auctioned off more than 170,000 bitcoins in 2014 and 2015, confiscated after the closure of Silk Road, a black market website. 
Bitcoin has proved popular among users of underground market places and criminals because transactions are anonymous and need not involve any formal institution. 
Ernst and Young said the bitcoin was ""confiscated as proceeds of crime"" but declined to identify its client. Local news reports have previously said that the bitcoin was confiscated from an Australian man convicted of commercial drug trafficking in 2014. 
A spokesperson for the department of justice in Victoria state declined to comment, citing commercial considerations.  
EY partner Adam Nikitins said the company expects interest from asset investment managers, currency exchanges, investment banks and hedge funds in North America and Europe.
""The number of bitcoin transactions since 2012 has quadrupled and parties are seeing more opportunities and uses for the technology,"" said Nikitins.
The auction is not limited to Australian nationals. On Friday, the price of bitcoin rose to $530, the highest level since August 2014. Trades involving the Chinese yuan are estimated to account for as much as 95 percent of bitcoin's trading volume. The market value of all bitcoin in circulation amounts to around $8 billion.($1 = 1.3930 Australian dollars)

Last week, the dollar rose to two-month highs against the other major currencies on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said U.S. interest rates could rise in the coming months and after data showing U.S. first quarter growth was revised upward.

Higher rates are positive for the dollar because they make the U.S. currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
The dollar was already broadly higher ahead of Yellen’s remarks after data showing that the slowdown in U.S. first quarter growth was not a sharp as initially estimated.

157,By Investing.com,"<span>May 27, 2016 06:11PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls to 10-week low, as Yellen anticipates imminent rate hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Friday, plummeting to fresh 10-week lows, after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said it could be appropriate to raise short-term interest rates in the near future if incoming data in the coming weeks fulfills the expectations of the U.S. central bank.
The currency pair traded between 1.1111 and 1.1201, before settling at 1.1115, down 0.71% on the session. Since hitting nine-months in early-May, EUR/USD has fallen considerably by nearly 3%. Despite the recent pullback, the euro is still up sharply against its American counterpart over the last 12 months. Last year, during the last Friday of May, EUR/USD closed just under 1.10.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1434, the high from May 12.
The dollar rapidly appreciated on Friday afternoon after Yellen ostensibly supported a rate hike for the first time this year. Echoing hawkish sentiments from her colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee over the last two weeks, Yellen said Friday afternoon that it could be appropriate for the Fed to approve an imminent rate hike if the economy and labor markets continue to show improvement. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of their three meetings in 2016, after halting a seven-year zero interest rate policy in December.
""It’s appropriate for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time,” Yellen said in a Question-And-Answer session with Harvard economics professor Gregory Mankiw.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
At the same time, Yellen noted that the unemployment rate nears the FOMC's long-term objective, even as wage growth and the level of part-time workers, marginally attached to the labor market remains soft. Yellen also blamed ineffective fiscal policy initiatives for leading to slower productivity growth.
“That’s a serious and negative development,” Yellen said.
Prior to her appearance, the U.S. Commerce Department revised prior estimates of first quarter GDP higher by 0.3% to 0.8% on an annual basis, slightly below consensus forecasts of 0.9%. Though residential investment and exports helped drive growth, non-residential investment and government purchases continued to lag. In addition, soft personal consumption data could compel the Fed to adjust the timing of its next rate hike. In its latest estimates, the Commerce Department lowered the GDP price index for the first quarter by 0.1 to 0.6% on a year over year basis. Analysts expected to see a flat reading of 0.7%.

163,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2016 03:52AM ET</span>","Dollar holds steady, traders await Yellen speech for Fed clues","By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar stayed in consolidation mode on Friday after its rally to two-month highs ran out of steam with bulls looking for fresh guidance from the head of the U.S. central bank.
The dollar index (DXY) was last at 95.195, having pulled back from a peak of 95.661 set on Wednesday. 
It is still up nearly 2.3 percent this month, among the top performing currencies, after a string of Federal Reserve officials bolstered expectations for a hike in interest rates as early as next month.
""I'm not sure how concerted this whole thing has been. If it's all kind of planned or if it's just individual members speaking,"" said Jesper Bargmann, head of trading for Nordea Bank in Singapore, referring to the Fed officials' relatively hawkish comments. 
Traders are now keen to hear from Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who is due to speak at an event hosted by the Harvard University Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at 1715 GMT.
""This is her chance if she wants to give a hint,"" Bargmann said.
Also closely watched is the second estimate of the March quarter U.S. gross domestic product. Analysts polled by Reuters expect to see an upgrade of the earlier reading, which showed the economy grew at its slowest pace in two years.  
The euro held steady at $1.1190 , staying above a two-month trough of $1.1129 set on Wednesday. 
The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 109.85 , still down from a three-week high of 110.59 yen reached last Friday.
There was little reaction to the outcome of a two-day Group of Seven summit. The G7 industrial powers pledged on Friday to seek strong global growth, while papering over differences on currencies and stimulus policies. 
""Specific to FX matters, the G7 communique was a non-event,"" said Heng Koon How, senior FX strategist for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Private Banking Asia Pacific.
Heng said the dollar is likely to trade with elevated volatility in the 110 yen to 105 yen area. 
""At around the 10 percent handle, the implied volatility curve for dollar/yen may be under valuing the growing list of event risks,"" he said. 
Such risks include the potential for more Bank of Japan monetary easing, as well as uncertainties related to the Fed meeting in June and the UK referendum on whether to stay in the European Union, Heng added. 
The yen showed limited reaction to media reports that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering delaying a sales tax hike, originally planned in April 2017, by around two years.
If Japan were to delay the planned sales tax hike, some market participants say the initial reaction may be for Tokyo shares to rise, which could weigh on the safe haven yen.

Still, a possible postponement of the sales tax hike has probably been mostly factored in, said a trader for a Japanese bank in Singapore, so any market impact may be limited even in the event of an official announcement to that effect.

USD/JPY changed hands at 109.91, up 0.13%, while AUD/USD was down 0.01% to 0.7225.
In Japan, national CPI for April fell 0.3%, in line with the 0.3% drop seen year-on-year, while national core CPI also dropped 0.3%, below the expected 0.4% decline year-on-year.
Consumer prices remain under pressure from lower goods prices as food companies and restaurant chains were cautious about raising prices at the start of fiscal 2016 in April.
Service costs, which account for a little over half of the CPI basket showed a slight pickup, with a tighter labor supply supporting prices for housekeeping and medical services.
Overall a slower pace of wage hikes in fiscal 2016 is clouding the prospect for the Bank of Japan guiding inflation to 2% from zero in the medium term. It is still uncertain whether the recent pickup in crude oil prices will continue amid slow global growth.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.05% to 95.19.
Overnight, the dollar pushed lower to a one-week trough against the other major currencies on Thursday, as investors continued to lock-in profits from the greenback’s recent rally to two-month highs after the release of strong U.S. data added to expectations for an upcoming U.S. rate hike.
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose by 5.1% last month, beating expectations for a gain of 0.6% and hitting the highest level in over a decade.
The report came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending May 21 decreased by 10,000 to 268,000 from the previous week’s total of 278,000.
Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 3,000 to 275,000 last week.
Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 3.4% last month, compared to economists' expectations for an increase of 0.5%.
Core durable goods orders, which exclude volatile transportation items, rose 0.4% last month, compared to forecasts for a 0.3% gain.
But investors continued to lock in profits from the greenback’s rally to two-month highs this week amid speculation the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as next month.

The currency pair traded between 1.1155 and 1.1217, before settling at 1.1193, up 0.0038 or 0.34% for the session. Despite the brief gains over the last two sessions, the euro is still in the midst of one of its driest spells on the calendar year. Since hitting nine-months in early-May, EUR/USD has fallen considerably by nearly 3%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1434, the high from May 12. 
On Thursday morning, the U.S. Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell by 10,000 for the week ended on May 20 to 268,000, slightly below analysts' expectations of 275,000. At the same time, the four-week average ticked up by 3,000 to 278,500, reflecting three previous weeks of considerable gains. The rising four-week average could provide an ominous harbinger for the labor market heading into next week's critical May jobs' report, the last before the Federal Open Market Committee meets on June 14-June 15.
Yellen will make her first public appearance in nearly two months at a ceremony when she receives the Radcliffe Medal from Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Friday afternoon. Yellen could provide further hints on the pace of the Fed's long-term rate path in a Question-And-Answer session with Harvard economics professor Gregory Mankiw after the presentation. Over the last two months, Yellen has reiterated that the Fed will raise rates gradually in the current cycle, amid widespread volatility in global financial markets and persistently low inflation.
Two other Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policymakers, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard and Fed governor Jerome Powell, sent indications on Thursday that the Fed could raise rates shortly. The FOMC has left its benchmark Fed Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its three meetings this year since its historic rate hike last December. At an appearance Thursday at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Powell admitted the prospects of a Brexit by the U.K. from the European Union in a June 23 referendum could cause the Fed to exercise caution when deciding on whether to raise rates. 
Elsewhere, Spain's economy grew by 3.4% on an annual basis in the first quarter, the country's statistics agency said Thursday. Spanish GDP also increased by 0.8% from the fourth quarter of last year, according to the Spanish government. Both readings were in line with consensus estimates. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.30% to an intraday low of 94.93 before settling at 95.14. The index is down by more than 4% since early-December. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year dropped four basis points to 1.83%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year inched down one basis point to 0.14%. Yields on U.S. and Germany 10-year bonds are both down more than 30 basis points over the last year. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against the euro, yen, and franc on Thursday after U.S. economic data showed weakness in business spending plans, denting expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate increase in June or July. 
The Commerce Department said orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods surged 3.4 percent last month after increasing 1.9 percent in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders rising only 0.5 percent last month.
But non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.8 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in the prior month. These so-called core capital goods orders have declined for three consecutive months. [nL2N18N0FD]
Doubts still remain about the likelihood of a June or July Fed rate increase, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, hit 94.938, its lowest level in eight days (DXY). The euro rose more than half a percentage point to a session high of $1.1216, rebounding from Wednesday's 10-week low of $1.1126. 
The dollar hit its lowest level in a week against the Swiss franc, at 0.9873 franc . The dollar was last down 0.44 percent at 109.70 Japanese yen after hitting a session low of 109.42 yen early in the session .
Fed funds futures contracts on Thursday implied traders saw a 26 percent chance the U.S. central bank would raise rates in June, down from 32 percent on Wednesday.
""The market is scaling back some of its confidence in a June or July rate hike,"" said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy for North America at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in New York.
The dollar's losses on Thursday reduced its gains since May 18, when minutes from the Fed's April policy meeting signaled the central bank had edged closer to a rate increase in the near term. [nL2N18F21S]
Remarks from Fed officials on Thursday and earlier this week also supported bets for a rate rise in June or July. [nL2N18N185][nL3N18N3UP]
The dollar index remains about 0.7 percent higher since the release of the Fed minutes.
Investors were awaiting comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Friday.
BK's Schlossberg said Yellen would likely take a neutral stance in order to keep the central bank's options open.

""She will be extraordinarily sensitive to not promise anything that she can't deliver,"" he said.

Analysts also anticipate that the GDP Price Index will remain steady at 0.7%. In addition, the University of Michigan is expected to report a slight decline in consumer sentiment  to 95.5, after the flash reading surged by almost 7 points to 95.8, its strongest level in more than a year.
Market participants also await comments from Yellen on Friday afternoon at Harvard University for further indications on the timing of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) first interest rate hike in 2016. The dollar has gained strength, while gold has fallen precipitously since the minutes from the Fed's April meeting last week showed that the U.S. central bank could support a rate hike next month if the incoming data continues to show broad improvements in the economy. In two rare public appearances this spring, Yellen has largely maintained a dovish stance that the Fed will raise rates gradually in the current cycle, amid widespread global financial risks and persistently low inflation.
Meanwhile, Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan indicated on Wednesday that he could support two rate hikes from the FOMC this year, as the labor market moves toward full employment. Addressing reporters at a speech in Houston, Kaplan also noted that the U.K.'s referendum on whether to leave the European Union on June 23 could factor in on the Fed's decision a week earlier.
""If economic data keeps going the way it is, I've said I will advocate for an increase in the near future,"" Kaplan said. ""That may not be June or July; my approach is take one meeting at a time.""
The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool indicated on Wednesday that there is a 31.9% chance the FOMC will raise rates in June, near the high end of estimates from earlier this week. Some analysts appear concerned that the FOMC could delay a potential rate hike until after the Brexit vote.
When the FOMC meets again in July, there is now a 45.7% that the committee will raise rates, up from 15.0% last month. In the euro area, ECB chief economist Peter Praet said in an interview with Publico that the central bank still has the tools at its disposal to lower rates deeper into negative territory, amid a so-called ""erosion of trust"" in globalization. The ECB's Governing Council will convene for its next monetary policy meeting late next week.

Domestic first quarter growth appears to be in line with its April forecast the bank said, although business investment remained disappointing.
“In Canada, the economy’s structural adjustment to the oil price shock continues, but is proving to be uneven,” the bank said.
The bank noted that damage from the Alberta wildfires and curtailment of production in the nearby oilsands region will cut about 1.25% off second quarter growth.
However, the BoC was confident that the economy would rebound in the third quarter, as oil production resumes and reconstruction begins.
“While the Canadian dollar has been fluctuating in response to shifting expectations of U.S. monetary policy and higher oil prices, it is now close to the level assumed in April,” the bank added.
Regarding price stability, the BoC considered inflation to be roughly in line with its expectations.
“Meanwhile, the risks to the bank’s inflation projection remain roughly balanced,” it said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hit a two-month peak against its basket of peer currencies on Wednesday, boosted by robust U.S. housing data supporting the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the near term, but fell back slightly. 
The dollar index inched 0.1 percent lower to 95.503 (DXY), after earlier rising as high as 95.661, one tick above the overnight high hit after data showed new U.S. single-family home sales surged to a more than eight-year peak in April and prices hit a record high.

""People are taking a low profile today. Most people are just squaring positions ahead of the month-end,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo. ""The dollar's downside should be limited for now,"" he added.
The upbeat housing numbers backed the Fed's April policy meeting minutes, released last week, which hinted that the central bank may raise rates soon if the economy appeared strong enough.

The dollar could take its cues over the next few days from data including U.S. initial jobless claims and pending home sales on Thursday, and Japanese inflation and U.S. first quarter GDP figures on Friday.  
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is also due to speak on Friday, which is also the concluding day for the G7 summit being held in Japan.

With the sharp gains, new home sales surged to their highest level since January, 2008, topping the next closest reading by more than 70,000. Analysts expected to see slight gains of 12,000 to 523,000 after March's subdued reading. The stellar figures are a positive sign for economists ahead of a bevy of monthly reports set to be released later this week. On Wednesday, the Federal House Finance Agency (FHFA) is expected to report a 0.5% gain in home prices for single-family housing for the month of March. It comes after the FHFA's House Price Index only rose by 5.6% on an annual basis a month earlier. Economists typically keep a close eye on home appreciation in low-inflation environments such as the one the U.S. economy is currently experiencing. At week's end, analysts will receive updates on second quarter GDP and the May final reading of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan.

Investors' anticipation of a rate increase from the Fed in June or July gained momentum following minutes from the central bank's April meeting released last week and comments on Monday from Fed officials signaling a June hike was firmly on the table.

Lele said he expected the Fed to hike rates in June or July, and then again in December, and was bullish on the U.S. dollar. He expected the euro to fall toward $1.05 over the next 12 months, while the dollar could rise above 115 yen. 
Fed funds futures contracts implied traders expected a 34 percent chance of a rate hike in June, compared with a 30 percent chance on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.
Commerce Department data on Tuesday showed new U.S. single-family home sales surged to a more than eight-year high in April and prices hit a record high, also supporting the greenback.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1187 and 1.1243, before settling at 1.1219, down 0.002 or 0.02% for the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in five of the last six sessions. For the month of May as a whole, the euro has only recorded four winning sessions against its American counterpart. Since hitting nine-months in early-May, EUR/USD has fallen considerably by more than 2.5%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1434, the high from May 12.
The euro appeared headed for sharp losses in overnight trading, after  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president James Bullard reiterated that the U.S. central bank has a plan in place to raise rates gradually if the economy improves as expected. Speaking at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum in Beijing, Bullard emphasized that he sees more factors in favor of a series of slow rate increases than no hikes at all, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) prepares for a critical interest rate decision in three weeks. Prior to the meeting, the U.S. Department of Labor will release its May national jobs report next week, providing the FOMC with key data on the pace of job growth nationwide. While nonfarm payrolls have increased exponentially and the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, the U.S. economy added only 160,000 jobs in May far below consensus estimates.
""Labor markets are relatively tight. This may put upward pressure on inflation going forward,"" said Bullard a voting member of the FOMC during the current cycle. ""This is an important factor supporting the FOMC view on the expected path of the policy rate.""
Several hours later, San Francisco Fed president John Williams said in an appearance in New York that he thinks it could be appropriate to raise interest rates two to three times this year, followed by another three to four times in 2017. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged this year at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Later during a question and answer session, Williams admitted he is not sure whether the FOMC will raise rates in June.
The dollar, though, recoiled as the session wore on amid heavy short covering. At one point Monday, the dollar approached levels from the end of last week when it surged to near two-month highs.
Bullard kicked off a busy week of public appearances for FOMC members, ahead of the release of GDP and Consumer Sentiment data on Friday. Fed chair Janet Yellen will close the week with a speech at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.
In Europe, Markit's Euro Area Composite PMI index inched down 0.1 in the May flash reading to 52.9, slightly below consensus forecasts of 53.1. It came as the Services index  stayed flat at 53.1, while Manufacturing declined by 0.2 to 51.5. Analysts expected to see a gain of 0.2 to 51.9.

Economists had expected the index to rise to 53.2.
The rate of business activity expansion in the dominant service sector was unchanged for a third successive month. But the rate of manufacturing output growth was the second-weakest since February 2015, the report said.
The slowdown in economic activity highlighted the challenges facing the European Central Bank in its attempts to spur growth and inflation in the region.
“A disappointing flash euro zone PMI for May adds further to the suggestion that the robust pace of economic growth seen in the first quarter will prove temporary. The PMI is signaling lackluster GDP growth of only 0.3% in the second quarter,” Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said.
The report came after similar surveys showed that German private sector activity accelerated for first time in 2016 in May, despite a slower rise in new business.
French private sector activity grew at the fastest pace in seven months in May.
The euro hit one-week lows against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.65% at 122.83.

211,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2016 10:09PM ET</span>",Dollar falls vs yen after Japan logs larger-than-expected trade surplus,"By Shinichi Saoshiro and Ian Chua
TOKYO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar fell versus the yen on Monday, dragged lower by sliding Tokyo stocks and data showing Japan logged a much larger-than-expected trade surplus in April.
The greenback was down 0.5 percent at 109.720 yen , pulling back from a three-week high of 110.59 scaled on Friday.
Data on Monday showed Japan's trade balance in April was 823.5 billion yen ($7.50 billion), against economists' forecasts for a 492.8 billion yen increase. Japan logged a trade surplus for the third consecutive month. 
If a country's exports exceed its imports, as in Japan's recent case, there is in theory a high demand for its goods and therefore for its currency.
""The April trade surplus was due in large part to weak imports. Still, the data was enough to trigger yen buying,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""The trade numbers came out against a political backdrop that does not favor Japan intervening to weaken the yen, thus making it relatively easy for participants to buy back the yen.""
A Group of 7 finance ministers' meeting concluded on Saturday with the United States warning Japan against intervening to weaken the yen, displaying a well known rift between the two countries on currency intervention.
That disagreement on currencies helped push the Nikkei <.225> down more than 1 percent, adding further support for the safe-haven yen.
The U.S. currency got off to a steady start to the week against other major peers, with the dollar index remaining within striking distance of a two-month peak after markets last week moved to price in a greater chance of an imminent hike in U.S. interest rates.
The dollar index (DXY) was last at 95.195, little changed from where it closed in New York on Friday and not far from Thursday's high of 95.520. It rose 0.8 percent last week, climbing for a third week.
The euro was effectively flat at $1.1231 , staying within distance of a two-month trough of $1.1180 plumbed on Thursday.
Emboldening dollar bulls, recent comments from Federal Reserve officials as well as minutes of the Fed's April meeting have convinced many analysts and investors that a rate hike in June or July is a real possibility.
More Fed officials are due to speak later on Monday including James Bullard, John Williams and Patrick Harker. Last Thursday, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said the U.S. economy could be strong enough to warrant an interest rate increase in June or July.
""Market odds of a June rate hike ended the week at around 30 percent, up from 4 percent a week ago. That is a significant repricing,"" analysts at ANZ wrote in a note to clients. 
""We continue to see June as very much a 'live' meeting.""
The resurgent dollar has taken a heavy toll on commodity currencies, none more so than the Australian dollar which was further weighed by expectations of cuts in interest rates at home.

The Aussie was last at $0.7230 , having been as low as $0.7175 last week, a trough last seen more than two months ago.

216,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2016 06:14PM ET</span>","EUR/USD inches up, as markets continue to price in multiple Fed hikes","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose moderately on Friday bouncing from one-month lows, as currency traders continued to digest hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve that it appears ready to lift interest rates for the first time this since their historic rate hike in December. 
The currency pair traded between 1.1197 and 1.1237 before settling at 1.1223, up 0.0021 or 0.18% on the session. With the slight gains, the euro halted a three-day losing streak while closing higher for only the fourth time for the month of May. Since eclipsing 1.16 to hit an eight-month high at the start of the month, the euro has fallen more than 2.5% against the dollar. More broadly, the euro is still up by nearly 4% against its American counterpart year to date. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
As the dollar took a breather on Friday, investors looked ahead to a highly-anticipated bilateral meeting between U.S. Treasury secretary Jack Lew and Japan finance minister Taro Aso over the weekend at the Group of Seven finance leaders' summit in Japan. On Friday, a host of prominent finance ministers at the meeting reiterated the importance of abstaining from currency manipulation, amid widespread concern that Japan could engage in possible actions to devalue the yen in an effort to bolster imports and provide a boost to equities on the Nikkei 225. While expressing discontent with recent moves by the Japanese government to intervene in global foreign exchange markets, Aso reaffirmed on Friday that it is committed to ""avoiding competitive currency devaluation."" 
Last month, Lew sent explicit warnings to China, Germany and Japan to not take part in competitive currency devaluation, whether through Quantitative Easing or interest rate moves. At Friday's summit, Lew told reporters that top foreign officials made progress at February's G20 meeting in Shanghai due to a ""re-commitment"" by participants to refrain from such currency manipulations.
Market players also continued to digest broad signals from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that it will raise short-term interest rates at a two-day meeting next month if the domestic economy shows improvement over the next few weeks. Earlier this week, several FOMC policymakers indicated that the committee could lift rates more than once before the end of the year, if global financial risk continues to recede and inflation firms. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at the current range between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its three meetings this year. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising the Fed Funds Rate 25 basis points. 
On Friday afternoon, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said in its weekly Commitment of Traders report that short positions in the EUR/USD rose by 1,000 last week to 23,000, while long positions in the yen remained unchanged at 59,000. The largest change occurred in the AUD/USD, where long positions fell by 13,000 to 25,000. Overall, speculators cut their short wagers in the U.S. dollar for the second straight week from a total value of $6.19 billion to $4.19, according to calculations from Reuters. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.10% to an intraday high of 95.46 before closing at 95.29.

221,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2016 08:18AM ET</span>","Japan, U.S. remain at loggerheads over yen policy","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
SENDAI, Japan (Reuters) - Japan and the United States remained at loggerheads over exchange-rate policy on Friday with Washington saying yen moves continued to be ""orderly,"" signaling that Tokyo has no justification to intervene in the market to stem yen gains.
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso reiterated Tokyo's view that excessive and disorderly currency moves were undesirable, making it clear authorities won't hesitate to step into the market if they consider any yen spike as out of line with economic fundamentals.
""In line with previous commitments by G7 and G20, I said stability in exchange rates is extremely important as excess volatility and disorderly movements would hurt the economy,"" Aso told reporters after meeting Group of Seven (G7) finance leaders in Sendai, northeast Japan.
But a senior U.S. Treasury official said currency moves are deemed ""disorderly"" enough to warrant intervention only when they are triggered by a crisis such as the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit northeast Japan in March 2011.
There needs to be a distinction between such moves and market fluctuations ""that happen,"" the official said, adding that ""you know"" when truly disorderly conditions occur.
""We've had agreements in the G7 and G20 for a number of years that have been very solid, workable ... that give all of us the ability to use domestic tools for domestic purposes, but that they commit to refraining from exchange-rate targeting unless there are disorderly conditions,"" the official said.
""I continue to believe that Japan has orderly conditions,"" he said, when asked whether Washington's stance on the yen has not changed since last month's Group of 20 finance leaders' gathering in Washington.
ASO, LEW TO MEET SATURDAY
Japanese authorities have stayed away from the markets since they last intervened in 2011. At the time, Tokyo got G7 consent to intervene to stem a yen spike driven by speculation that a devastating earthquake would force Japanese insurers to repatriate overseas funds to pay for damage claims.
Currency market stability is among topics financial leaders of the G7 advanced economies are discussing at the two-day gathering that kicked off on Friday.
Japan has failed to bridge differences with the United States on the yen, with Washington dismissing Tokyo's concerns that recent yen rises are excessive and instead pushing for agreements against currency market interventions.
The rift may be evident again when Aso and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew hold a bilateral meeting Saturday morning.
The U.S. Treasury official said it was important that G7 and G20 countries adhere to their commitment to refrain from ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" currency policies so countries would instead pursue monetary, fiscal and structural steps to boost growth.
""If you're competing for your share of a shrinking pie that won't lead to a better global economy,"" the official said.
Japanese policymakers, including Aso, have repeatedly threatened to intervene in the market to stem yen rises, particularly when the currency hit a 18-month high against the dollar earlier this month.
The dollar's recent rebound against the yen, however, has eased some concerns among the Japanese policymakers of the pain a strong yen could inflict on a fragile economy.

The dollar stood around 110 yen on Friday, buoyed in part by renewed expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as early as in June.

225,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2016 11:02PM ET</span>","Dollar holds firm vs yen and euro on Fed hike view, pound bullish","By Ian Chua and Shinichi Saoshiro
SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held at its highest in nearly two months against a basket of major currencies early on Friday, on track for a third week of gains as investors awaken to the risk of a hike in U.S. interest rates as early as next month.
New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley on Thursday said the U.S. economy could be strong enough to warrant a rate increase in June or July.
His comments reinforced surprisingly clear signals of a possibly imminent rate hike in minutes of the Federal Reserve's April policy meeting and underpinned an already-firm greenback.
The dollar index (DXY) last stood at 95.289, having been as high as 95.502 overnight - a level last seen on March 29. It was up nearly 0.8 percent this week and has risen 2.4 percent in the past three weeks.
""The market is currently ascribing around a 60 percent chance that the U.S. Fed will hike rates by the July meeting, and NAB has pencilled-in a July rate hike,"" said Tapas Strickland, economist at National Australia Bank.
""Fed officials are seemingly content with such a pricing,"" he said, adding an earlier June move could be complicated by the Brexit referendum which occurs a week after the June 14-15 Fed review. 
Against the yen, the greenback reached a three-week high of 110.39  but dipped back to around 110.00 as weakness on Wall Street, hit by revived prospects of a near-term U.S. rate hike, shored up the safe-haven Japanese currency.
The U.S. currency was on track to gain 1.3 percent this week, during which it pulled significantly away from an 18-month low of 105.55 yen plumbed early in May after the Bank of Japan refrained from further monetary easing. 
The euro also eased against the yen to 123.22 (EURJPY=R), though it remained tightly range-bound since bouncing off a three-year trough of 121.48 early this month.
On the dollar, the common currency hovered around $1.1200 , having touched its lowest in over seven weeks at $1.1180.
For potential cues the currency market awaited the G7 meeting of central bankers and finance ministers kicking off on Friday in the northern Japanese city of Sendai, although the event's potential impact may have lessened since the yen's bull run has ended.
""Had the yen remained strong going in to the G7 meeting, discussions would have revolved around the possibility of intervention. But the market has calmed down and the meeting is drawing less attention from participants,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
The yen's surge to an 18-month high versus the greenback earlier this month had prompted threats of intervention from Japanese authorities. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, on the other hand, said that he saw no ""disorderly"" moves in the market that warrants intervention.
A standout performer was sterling, which rose broadly after a robust UK retail sales report diminished chances of an interest rate cut that some investors were factoring in.
The pound reached a two-week high of $1.4663  and was last at $1.4598. Its trade-weighted index peaked at 87.9 <=GBP>, its highest since Feb. 5.

In contrast, the embattled Australian dollar stood little changed at $0.7233  after briefly dipping below 72 U.S. cents for the first time since early March.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.118 and 1.1230 before settling at 1.1201, down 0.0019 or 0.14% on the session. It came one day after the euro suffered one of its worst one-day declines versus the dollar in two months, as the Federal Open Market Committee sent broad indications that it will raise interest rates in June if the U.S. economy continues to show improvement over the next several weeks. The euro has closed lower against its American counterpart in 11 of the last 13 sessions, dropping more than 2.5% during the span.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Thursday morning, New York Fed president William Dudley noted that it could be appropriate to raise interest rates in June or July  if U.S. GDP continues to pick up following a weak first quarter. Speaking at a New York Fed event, Dudley also acknowledged that the Fed should weigh the potential of a U.K. departure from the European Union as it makes its decision. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at 0.25-0.50% in three meetings in 2016, after raising it for the first time in seven years in a historic decision last December.
In response to the Fed's comments, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the probability of a June rate hike at 26.3% on Thursday, while leaving the odds for a July rate increase relatively unchanged at 42.1%. By comparison, the CME Group said there was a 15% chance of a July rate hike last month. The CME Group also increased the probability the Fed will complete two rate hikes by December to 25.8%, up from 12.1% last month. Also in June, the FOMC will issue its quarterly long-term projections on the path of the Federal Funds Rate, PCE Inflation, changes in Real GDP and the Unemployment Rate.
While Fed governor Stanley Fischer did not address whether the FOMC should raise rates in June at the same event in New York on Thursday, Fischer indicated that policymakers should spend more time on discovering ways to bolster the ""equilibrium real interest rate."" The rate, which measures the borrowing costs related to steady inflation and maximum employment, helps guide the Fed on when it is appropriate to raise rates, Fischer said.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged to a seven-week high at 95.51, before falling back to 95.30 at the close. The index is still down nearly 5% since the start of December.
The ECB, meanwhile, underscored the importance of remaining independent from political decision in its April minutes, while hardly addressing the broad ramifications of a possible Brexit. The ECB's governing council also emphasized the need to meet its 2% inflation objective and admitted that its market-based inflation expectations struggled to increase at the same pace as the massive rebound in oil prices.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell one basis point to 1.85%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year were flat at 0.17%. On Wednesday, the spread between U.S. 10-year and 2-Year Treasuries narrowed to an intraday low of 85 basis points, as the yield curve hit its flattest level in nine years."

The Office for National Statistics said retail sales rose 1.3% in April, well above economists’ forecasts for an increase of 0.5%.
March’s figures were revised to show a 0.5% drop, a much smaller decline than the initial estimate of a fall of 1.3%.
Retail sales volumes were up 4.3% on a year over-year basis, the report said.
Sales of most items surged, but clothing sales fell by 6.3% the ONS said, perhaps due to cold weather in April, which hit sales of summer clothes.
GBP/USD was up 0.32% at 1.4645 from around 1.4626 ahead of the report.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied just off its highest since March in European trade on Thursday after a perceived increase in chances of a rise in U.S. interest rates by September drove its biggest daily gain in five weeks.
Stronger data, rhetoric from the Federal Reserve and a resulting shift on money markets has revived expectations among hedge funds of a new rally for the U.S. currency, which came within sight of parity with the euro a year ago. 
Yet in a U.S. election year, with markets suspicious that politics played a role in a slide since February, caution abounds.
Many speculative players have been disappointed over the past year by the U.S. currency's failure to rise and the most recent data from last week shows the market overall now betting net on a weaker dollar. 
""A lot of investors even today still want to keep the long dollar position in the portfolio. The reason is still simple: the monetary policy gap is there but a lot of people have been hurt,"" said James Kwok, head of currency management at French asset managers Amundi.
He has been cautious of backing the dollar strongly against other major currencies, preferring to back it against Asian currencies including China's yuan, the Singapore dollar and Korean won. 
""We think the dollar will continue to go up, but it will not be broad-based any more,"" he said. 
""It will not be against most of the currencies that people expect, not against the currencies whose central banks have tried hard to weaken through QE, negative rates and so on. You can see how dangerous it has become to bet against the yen."" 
After reaching a high of $1.1206 at the start of European trading, the dollar was steady on the day at $1.1220  and up 0.1 percent against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength. (DXY)
It inched lower to 110.085 yen but was up by as much as a third of a percent against the Canadian and New Zealand dollars.  
While the U.S. dollar could see further gains against the yen in the near term, the pace is likely to become more gradual given the potential for dollar-selling by Japanese exporters, said a trader for a Japanese bank in Tokyo.
""There is no doubt that the levels are becoming attractive for exporters to conduct some currency hedging,"" he said.
The dollar's rebound against the yen no doubt came as a relief to Japanese officials, who were concerned that the yen's recent strength would stifle Japan's nascent economic recovery.
A number of major Japanese exporters have set their dollar/yen exchange rate assumptions for the 2016/17 business year, which began in April, at levels around 110 yen to 105 yen.
Among them are major car makers Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267), which are both assuming an average dollar rate of 105 yen in 2016/17.
Currencies are likely to be a topic at the G7 finance leaders' meeting in Sendai, northern Japan on Friday and Saturday. The meeting could expose a rift on issues ranging from currency to fiscal policies within the group of advanced economies.
Japanese officials have warned regularly of ""one-sided"" moves in the yen, but most analysts believe U.S. opposition will prevent them intervening against the currency. 

""I would expect Japan to seek understanding of their FX and monetary policy. However 'dissent' from the U.S. on FX intervention will still remain,"" said Roy Teo, senior FX strategist for ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) Bank in Singapore.

239,By Investing.com,"<span>May 18, 2016 06:21PM ET</span>","EUR/USD slips below 1.13, as Fed leaves window open for June rate hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Wednesday, plunging to its lowest level in three weeks, as the Federal Reserve sent strong indications that it will raise short-term interest rates when it meets next in June if the domestic economic outlook improves as expected.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1214 and 1.1316, before settling at 1.1218, down 0.0099 or 0.85% on the session. With the considerable losses, the euro closed below 1.13 against the dollar for the first time since April 29. At the same time, the euro suffered its worst one-day loss versus the greenback in more than a month. For the month of May, the dollar has closed higher against its European counterpart in all but two sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said in the minutes from its April meeting that it is leaving the possibility open for a June rate hike as the economy continues to strengthen and headwinds from global financial markets continue to recede. Since raising the Federal Funds Rate in December for the first time in seven years, the FOMC has left its benchmark interest rate steady in each of its three meetings this year. The FOMC cited a stable dollar, rising equity prices and a strong labor market as factors for tightening monetary policy, while noting that weak inflation and the potential of a U.K. departure from the European Union could lead to a delay in the first rate hike of 2016.
""In its postmeeting statement, rather than stating that global economic and financial developments continued to pose risks, the Committee decided to indicate that it would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments,"" the FOMC said in the April minutes. ""This change in language was intended to convey the Committee's sense that the risks associated with global developments had diminished somewhat since the March FOMC meeting without characterizing the overall balance of risks.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
""Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" the FOMC added.
Investors will parse closely-watched speeches from Fed governor Stanley Fischer and New York Fed president William Dudley on Thursday for further indications on the tightening path the FOMC could pursue over the final half of the year. At a joint appearance in Washington on Tuesday, both Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed president John Williams suggested that ""two to three rate hikes,"" this year seems possible.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year shot up eight basis points to 1.85%. Earlier on Wednesday, the spread between the 10-year and 2-Year U.S. Treasuries fell to an intraday low of 85 basis points, as the yield curve hit its flattest level in nine years.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by as much as 0.70% to an intraday high of 95.23, before settling at 95.20. At session-highs, the index hit its highest level since late-March."

250,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2016 07:50PM ET</span>","Dollar steady, awaits Japan GDP for cues","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held steady on Wednesday, awaiting the Japanese gross domestic product data due later in the day for cues after failing to sustain gains following its advance to a three-week high versus the yen.
Economists polled by Reuters expect Japan's GDP to have grown at a modest 0.1 percent in the January-March quarter in annualized terms, highlighting the slowdown in the world's third largest economy.
""Japan risks slipping into a technical recession. In that case, expectations will increase for further fiscal stimulus, a delay in the consumption tax hike and more monetary easing,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""These factors would be supportive for dollar/yen as they could add weight to the argument for intervening to weaken the yen.""
The dollar stood little changed at 109.13 yen . The U.S. currency had briefly spiked to 109.65, its highest since April 28, on Tuesday after data showed U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in more than three years in April. 
The greenback, however, drifted off the high as U.S. equities flagged and nudged down Treasury bond yields.
The euro was steady at $1.1312  after closing little changed against the dollar overnight.
The pound treaded water at $1.4455 . Sterling spiked to $1.4524 overnight after a pair of polls showing the ""In"" camp well ahead in the run-up to Britain's June 23 referendum on European Union membership.
The gains were trimmed however by lower-than-expected U.K. inflation data.

The Australian dollar  slipped 0.1 percent to $0.7320, consolidating after rallying on Tuesday when minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) May policy meeting encouraged markets to pare back the chances of a cut in interest rates.

251,By Investing.com,"<span>May 17, 2016 05:53PM ET</span>","EUR/USD flat, even as Fed officials send hints of multiple rate hikes","Investing.com -- EUR/USD was virtually flat on Tuesday, as investors digested hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve on the increased likelihood of multiple interest rate hikes from the U.S. central bank this year despite the release of subdued core inflation figures earlier in the session.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1302 and 1.1347, before settling at 1.1314, down 0.0001 or 0.01% on the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in three of the last four sessions and nine of the last 11. Though the euro is only up modestly against the dollar over the last month, it still remains up by more than 4% against its American counterpart since the start of 2016. Incredibly, EUR/USD is only down 0.0003 from its level 52 weeks ago.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4% in April, slightly above consensus forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Consumer prices accelerated last month after a modest 0.1% gain in March. A surge in gasoline prices by nearly 10% drove the gains, as April CPI rose by 1.1% on a yearly basis, up from 0.9% a month earlier. As a result the Core CPI Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.2% in line with consensus estimates. On an annual basis, the core index is up by 2.1% in comparison with its reading from April, 2015. It represents a slight decline from March when core prices increased by 2.2% on a yearly basis.
By comparison, the Core PCE Index inched down to 1.6% two months ago. The Core PCE Index, which also discounts food and energy prices, is the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. As the Fed looks for signs that persistently sluggish inflation is firming, the reading has remained below its targeted goal of 2% in every month over the last three years.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range of 0.25-0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. After implementing its first rate hike in seven years in mid-December, the FOMC said in a closely-watched forecast that it could raise short-term interest rates as much as four times this year. Since then, the FOMC has lowered its outlook to two, amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. Currently, there is a 7.5% chance the FOMC will raise rates by 25 basis points, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool, when it meets next on June 14-15. There is also a 37% chance the FOMC will wait until September before lifting rates, up from 28.8% last month.
The dollar also received only a slight boost from hawkish comments by a pair of Fed policymakers on Tuesday, regarding the increased possibility that the FOMC could raise short-term rates multiple times before the start of 2017. At a joint appearance in Washington, both Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed president John Williams suggested that ""two to three rate hikes,"" seem possible, while Lockhart noted that a rate hike will still remain on the table at the FOMC's next meeting. Neither Lockhart, nor Williams own a vote in the current policy cycle.
Any rate hikes by the FOMC this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.15% to an intraday low of 94.31, before closing at 94.55. The index has crashed by more than 4% since early-December."
252,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2016 10:53AM ET</span>",Dollar dips against major rivals on Fed rate hike doubts ,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday after U.S. inflation data failed to convince currency traders that the Federal Reserve was moving closer to another interest rate hike. 
The dollar initially rose against the euro and Swiss franc after data showed U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in more than three years in April as gasoline and rents rose, with the euro hitting a session low against the greenback of $1.1303  and the dollar hitting a nearly nine-week high against the franc of 0.9803 franc . 
That move was short-lived, and the dollar erased gains to trade lower against the euro, yen, and franc. Analysts said the inflation data was mixed, partly since core CPI increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through April after rising 2.2 percent in March.
The euro was last up 0.19 percent against the dollar at $1.1335, near a session high of $1.1347. The dollar was down 0.06 percent against the yen at 108.95 yen , easing from a more than two-week high of 109.64 yen. 
""If you are a hawk, you could see the CPI as being higher, but in reality, the numbers were pretty much on consensus,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago, in reference to Fed policymakers considered ""hawks"" for favoring tighter monetary policy. 
Fed funds futures on Tuesday suggested traders saw an 11 percent probability of a Fed rate hike next month, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
The dollar gave back gains against the safe-haven yen on risk aversion, analysts said. Concerns over global economic growth partly drove a dip in U.S. stocks, which helped the yen recover against the dollar, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. 
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index was last down 0.39 percent. 
The Australian dollar  was last up 0.55 percent against the greenback at $0.7328. The Aussie earlier gained as much as 1.2 percent against the greenback and hit a session high of $0.7368 after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) tempered expectations of an interest rate cut. 

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.14 percent at 94.441 (DXY).

261,By Investing.com,"<span>May 16, 2016 06:02PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ticks up in quiet trade, ahead of key consumer inflation data","Investing.com -- EUR/USD inched up in subdued trade on Monday, as the dollar fell slightly due to weak manufacturing data, ahead of a critical release of monthly consumer prices in the U.S. which could provide clearer indications on the strength of the world's largest economy. 
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1303 and 1.1343, before settling at 1.1321, up 0.0004 or 0.03% on the session. The euro has followed up a six-day losing streak that screeched to a halt last Wednesday by closing higher in three of the last five sessions. Although the euro is relatively flat against the dollar over the last month, it is up by approximately 4% against its American counterpart since the start of the year. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24. 
The dollar continued its recent decline on Monday morning after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State Manufacturing Index in May has fallen 9.02 points, halting a brief run of monthly gains over the prior two months. Weakness in new orders and inventories dragged down the overall reading, while shipments turned lower in May creating further declines. Analysts expected an increase of 7.00, following a 9.56 gain in April.
Investors await Tuesday's release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April for further indications on the timing of the Federal Reserve's first interest rate hike  in 2016. Analysts are predicting a mild increase of 0.3% in April CPI, in response to a 0.1% gain in March. The Core CPI Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to tick up by 0.2%. Since raising interest rates for the first time in seven years in December, the Fed has been hesitant to tighten its money policy cycle even further amid sluggish inflation.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields. 
Foreign exchange traders also reacted to varying opinions from influential leaders on the ramifications of a potential Brexit. Over the weekend, a letter signed by more than 300 business leaders in the U.K. backed a British departure from the European Union, amid claims that red tape in Brussels stifles competition and limits job gains throughout Britain. In the U.S., Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump punted on the issue, telling Good Morning Britain that it wouldn't make any difference to him if the U.K. remained in the EU or not. 
Over the last several weeks, leading economists have warned that a Brexit could trigger heightened volatility on foreign exchange markets worldwide. British voters will decide on the public referendum on June 23. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.15% to an intraday low of 94.44, before settling at 94.53. The index has crashed by more than 4% since early-December. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year soared five basis points to 1.75%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year gained two basis points to 0.14%. Government bond yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds have both tumbled at least 40 basis points over the last year.

267,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2016 04:29AM ET</span>",Yen slips as Japan steps up verbal threats before G7 meets,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen eased on Monday as Japan stepped up its threat of intervention in the currency market before the Group of Seven meeting it will host this week, erasing early gains made as Chinese data disappointed. 
Japan's top currency diplomat Masatsugu Asakawa told the Nikkei newspaper that excess volatility may have adverse effects on the economy and that the G7 and G20 countries have repeatedly discussed how to deal with disorderly currency moves.
Japan will host a G7 finance ministers and central bankers summit on May 20-21 amid talk that Tokyo has been trying to drum up support for some kind of response to a strong yen.
Asakawa, who is vice finance minister for international affairs, also told Reuters that Japan would not be bound by the U.S. Treasury's recent report on currencies, which appeared to warn against unilateral intervention in currency markets.
Investors trimmed favorable positions in the yen, with expectations that Japan could ease monetary policy sooner rather than later to bolster inflation and growth reinforcing cautious investor sentiment. 
The dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 108.75 yen , having struck a two-week high of 109.57 on Friday after upbeat U.S. data. The safe-haven yen had initially gained in Asian trade after Chinese investment, factory output and retail sales all missed forecasts. 
""There may be rising scope of the BOJ considering a more aggressive policy stance later on,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
""It must still be kept in mind that inflation expectations as measured by five-year inflation swaps remain close to multi-year lows and that Governor (Haruhiko) Kuroda appears to make a bigger case of additional measures being considered should it prove necessary.""
Kuroda said on Friday that the Bank of Japan has ample room for easing, having adopted negative rates earlier this year.
Analysts said Japan's first-quarter GDP data on May 18 would be a focus. A Reuters poll forecasts annualized economic growth of 0.2 percent in January-March following a 1.1 percent contraction in October-December.  
""There are likely to be some market swings if the result were to come in much weaker than expected,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mistui Banking Corporation in Singapore. 
A weak number would knock stocks and bolster demand for the yen, Okagawa added, although the currency may retreat later if the government's responses include delaying next April's sales tax hike or similar.

The government denied a weekend media report that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has decided to delay the sales tax hike.

275,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2016 06:03PM ET</span>","EUR/USD continues retreat from 9-month highs, amid strong consumer data","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Friday, as the dollar continued its rally from 9-month lows amid an unexpected surge in U.S. consumer sentiment.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1283 and 1.1379, before settling at 1.1313, down 0.0061 or 0.56% on the session. At session-lows, the euro fell below 1.13 against the dollar for the first time in the month of May. The euro has now closed lower versus the dollar in eight of the last nine sessions. Despite the recent downturn, the euro is still up against American counterpart by more than 4% since the start of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Friday morning, the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center said its Consumer Sentiment Index soared nearly seven points in its mid-May flash reading to 95.8, significantly above consensus expectations of 89.7. It came weeks after consumer sentiment slumped to 89.0 in the final April reading, dropping to its lowest level since last September. In the May reading, though, the expectations component surged nearly 10 points to 87.5, pulling up the general index. Over the last year, the sluggish expectations component has dragged down consumer sentiments overall.
Earlier on Friday, the U.S. Census Bureau said retail sales last month jumped by 1.3%, above consensus expectations of 0.9%, rebounding from a 0.3% decline in March. The overall reading received a lift from auto sales, which surged 3.2% on the month. Still, core retail sales, which discounted the effects of auto purchases, increased by 0.8% above analysts' forecasts for gains of 0.5%.
Investors also continued to react to a letter from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to a member of the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday afternoon regarding the Fed's remote possibility likelihood of adopting a negative interest rate policy in the near future. In the letter addressed to Rep. Brad Sherman, Yellen said the Fed would not rule out the possibility of lowering rates into negative territory if an extremely adverse scenario arises in the coming months. Over the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) first three meetings of 2016, the U.S. central bank has held its benchmark interest rate steady while central banks in Japan and the euro area have adopted negative interest rate regimes. 
Market players also reacted to a flattening in the yield curve between short-term U.S. 2-Year Treasuries and longer-term 10-Year government bonds in Friday's session. At session-highs, the 2-year surged to 0.786%, its highest level in 10 days. Around the same time, government bond yields on the 10-year fell to a one-month low at 1.705%. A flattening of the yield curve typically sends indications of a slowdown in short-term economic activity.
In the euro area, Eurostat said on Friday morning that second quarter GDP in the zone is growing at a rate of 1.5% on an annual basis, slightly below analysts' forecasts of 1.6%. On a quarterly basis, second quarter growth is up by 0.5%, just below expectations of 0.6%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.65% to an intraday-high of 94.71, before settling at 94.60. The index is still down more than 4% since early-December."

283,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2016 04:57AM ET</span>",Dollar hits two-week high on rate hike bets ,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a two-week high against a basket of currencies on Friday, posting its best fortnightly performance since February, bolstered by the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is still on track to raise rates before any other major central bank. 
The greenback suffered a sharp sell-off since the start of the year, hitting a 16-month low earlier this month, as market expectations have faded that there would be at least two Fed rate hikes in 2016. 
But as fears about the global economy and market turbulence have subsided somewhat, some analysts say there are signs the tide could be turning for the dollar and that investors - who now only see around a 60 percent chance of any hike this year - might have pushed out those expectations too far. 
The currency was buoyed on Thursday by Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren, who said the Fed should raise interest rates if data confirms a stronger jobs market and inflation outlook in the second quarter. He added that the markets are too pessimistic on the economy.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against six major rivals, rose 0.2 percent to 94.442, its strongest since April 28. 
""Markets are trading in a way that suggests investors are quite uncomfortable with the extent of their short dollar exposure at the moment,"" said  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. 
Speculators increased bets against the U.S. dollar to the highest in over three years to the week to last Tuesday.[IMM/FX]
The euro was 0.4 percent down at a two-week low of $1.1329 , ahead of flash euro zone GDP data due at 0900 GMT. 
The currency market will have a chance to gauge the underlying strength of the U.S. economy through a batch of data to be released later in the day. 
Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 108.52 yen , well clear of an 18-month low of 105.55 hit last week after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy. 
The greenback could face renewed pressure against peers like the yen if U.S. economic indicators fall short of expectations, which would be a new potential headache for Japanese authorities who have managed to arrest the yen's appreciation by threatening to intervene.

""Japanese officials can keep up their verbal warnings and even actually intervene, but the fundamentals continue pointing toward a stronger yen - a view many speculators appear to have embraced,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, forex analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.

The currency pair traded between 1.1371 and 1.1429, before settling at 1.1376, down .0047 or 0.42% on the session. The euro has now closed down against the dollar in seven of the last eight sessions. Although the euro is down incrementally against its American counterpart over the last month, it is still up nearly 5% since the start of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
For the most part, foreign exchange traders proceeded cautiously on Thursday ahead of the release of monthly retail and consumer reports to close the week. On Friday morning, the U.S. Census Bureau is expected to report a sharp increase in  retail sales for the month of April, follow a mild decline a month earlier. Fueled by continuing strength in auto sales, retail sales are expected to surge 0.9% in April, one month after decreasing slightly by 0.3%. Shortly after, the University of Michigan could report a 0.7 increase in the preliminary May reading of its Consumer Sentiment Index, rebounding from a surprising downturn in April, which represented the most precipitous monthly decline since last September.
Also on Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to report a 0.3% increase in its Producer Price Index (PPI) for April, following a 0.1% decline a month earlier. The Core PPI Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to increase 0.1% one month after falling 0.1% in March.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Thursday that initial jobless claims last week rose by 20,000 to 294,000, defying expectations for an increase of 17,000. It followed a solid JOLTS report from the Labor Department on Tuesday, which showed that job openings in March rose by 149,000 on a seasonally-adjusted basis, lifting the job opening rate by 0.1% to 3.9%. The report came in the wake of a relatively soft April employment report last week, which documented the lowest pace of gains among nonfarm payrolls in seven months.
The Federal Reserve has continually reiterated that it is taking a data-driven approach to the timing of its first interest rate hike in 2016. In December, the Fed ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy by lifting its benchmark Federal Funds Rate 25 basis points to a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%. In three subsequent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left short-term rates steady, fueling speculation that the U.S. central bank could delay its next rate hike until September. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, Fed chair Janet Yellen said Thursday that she would not rule out adopting a negative interest rate policy if an extremely adverse scenario arises in the coming months. In a written response to questions from Rep. Brad Sherman, Yellen said the Fed is studying similar regimes in Japan and the euro area. The Fed, Yellen added, would also have to weigh the unintended consequences of the policy before considering the unorthodox move.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained one basis point to 1.75%. Over the last six sessions, yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds have remained in a tight range between 1.705 and 1.793%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.25% to an intraday-high of 94.16, before settling at 94.11. The index is still down more than 4% since early-December."

296,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2016 03:40AM ET</span>","Yen weaker on BOJ easing talk, BOE's 'Super Thursday' in focus ","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen fell on Thursday as investors sold the currency amid speculation that the Bank of Japan could decide to expand its monetary stimulus as soon as next month.
Talk of more action gathered pace after prominent Japanese academic Takatoshi Ito said the BOJ is likely to expand monetary stimulus either in June or July. Ito is said to have close ties to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
For his part, Kuroda said the BOJ won't hesitate to take further easing steps if necessary, adding that there were still large downside risks to Japan's economy. The BOJ introduced negative rates earlier this year, but that has had little impact on the yen or economic data, so far, analysts say.
The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 108.97 yen , recovering from a 18-month low of 105.55 yen on May 3, after the BOJ held off from expanding its monetary stimulus at its policy meeting in late April.
Traders have been cutting favorable bets on the yen following a series of warnings from Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso that Tokyo would intervene to curb any excessive one-sided gains.
""With policy easing speculation gaining ground and the Finance Minister talking down the yen, it is clear they do not want a stronger currency,"" said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea.
Many analysts believe Japan will be wary of intervening before it hosts a Group of Seven meeting this month, even though Tokyo is unhappy with the yen's rise of more than 10 percent so far this year.
""For dollar/yen, it would appear that it is now caught in nervous range trade around 105 to 110,"" said Heng Koon How, senior currency strategist for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Private Banking Asia Pacific. ""It is likely that Tokyo is still trying to build consensus and agreement on intervention both internationally and domestically.""
The focus in Europe will be on ""Super Thursday"" as investors prepare for the Bank of England's monetary policy decision, its minutes, the quarterly Inflation Report and a press conference from Governor Mark Carney. With the Brexit debate raging, chances are the monetary policy committee could sound dovish and the Bank may downgrade growth forecasts.
The pound on the defensive as polls showed the vote on Britain's membership in the European Union on June 23 is still too close to call. It was down 0.2 percent at $1.4415 , not far from its two-week low of $1.4375 touched on Monday.
The Norwegian crown (EURNOK=) was slightly higher before a Norges Bank rate decision at 0800 GMT. The bank is expected to keep rates unchanged, but with first-quarter growth data also due at the same time there is a chance that the numbers could show the Norwegian economy has stagnated. 

""If the Norges signals more rate cuts for September, we could see the crown drop. The market is pricing in a 50/50 chance for a move in September,"" said Nordea's Christensen.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney is bracing for a challenging meeting on Thursday when the BOE releases its first quarterly inflation report since February. The BOE is largely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate steady at 0.5 this year, even as inflation remains sharply below its 2% target. Since the BOE's, last inflation report the sterling has depreciated, hourly earnings have been muted and second quarter GDP growth forecasts have been relatively soft at 0.5%.
The meeting also comes weeks before a controversial referendum next month on U.K's status in the European Union. Earlier, Bank of England chancellor George Osborne admitted that the Treasury has engaged in significant contingency planning in the case the referendum passes on June 23 to allow a British departure from the European Union. In the U.S., several monetary policymakers including San Francisco Fed president John Williams, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan have indicated that the Brexit vote could affect the Fed's interest rate decision a week earlier, while St. Louis Fed president James Bullard has played down the global ramifications of the outcome of the referendum.
GBP/USD inched up 0.05% on Wednesday to 1.4449.

Appearing at a luncheon at Vienna's Economics University, Nowotny also noted that the ECB doesn't have the means to influence foreign exchange rates, despite approving a wide range of easing measures in recent months. Since the ECB lowered interest rates to a new record low and expanded the scope of its comprehensive Quantitative Easing program on March 10, the euro has jumped more than 3% against the dollar.

GBP/USD touched lows of 1.4389, down from around 1.4421 ahead of the data.
The Office for National Statistics reported that manufacturing output in the U.K. fell 1.9% in March from the same month a year earlier, the steepest annual fall since May 2013.
The fall was led by a 4% drop in the manufacture of basic metals & metal products, particularly iron and steel.
For the month, manufacturing output edged up by 0.1%, missing forecast for a 0.3% increase, after falling 0.9% in February.
Industrial output rose 0.3% in March and was 0.2% lower on a year-over-year basis.
The figures did not point towards any revision of the estimate of first quarter economic growth released last month, the ONS said.
The preliminary estimate showed that that rate of growth in Britain’s economy slowed to 0.4% in the three months to March from 0.6% in the previous quarter.
The ONS said it had no evidence that uncertainty over the looming referendum on Britain’s European Union membership on June 23 had hit output.
The weak data came as investors were looking ahead to the outcome of the Bank of England’s monetary policy meeting on Thursday.
The BoE was widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold.
Sterling was also lower against the euro, with EUR/GBP advancing 0.42% to 0.7907 from 0.7895 ahead of the data."
306,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2016 04:11AM ET</span>",Dollar gives back gains after rise to two-week highs,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar eased against a basket of currencies after six straight days of gains on Wednesday, a flat performance for equities and commodities markets prompting profit-taking by some of those who have backed the U.S. currency in the past week. 
The yen gained half a percent and the euro around 0.2 percent, halting a steady march by the greenback since it hit respectively 19- and 9-month lows at the start of May. 
A series of threats by Japan to intervene on its currency have had something to do with that turnaround and Koichi Hamada, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, was the latest to sound a currency market warning.
But many analysts say the bigger driver has been a general reluctance to drive the dollar much weaker than $1.15 to the euro and $1.45 to the pound at a time when the U.S. economy still seems far stronger than its developed world peers. 
U.S. debt yields, however, continue to fall on the back of further falls in expectations for interest rate rises over the next 18 months, weakening the main argument for any further gains in the dollar.
""The move that we've had over the past 5-6 trading days is really due to the dollar just becoming too soft,"" said Michael Sneyd, a strategist with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London. 
""We are still looking to sell the dollar against some of the other majors but we're hoping for another bit of a rally in the dollar to sell into.""
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, shed 0.2 percent to 94.108, moving away from a two-week high of 94.356 set overnight.
It was down 0.5 percent at 108.66 yen  after climbing to a two-week high of 109.38 yen early in the Asian session. Against the euro it fell 0.1 percent to $1.1389.
BNP's Sneyd argued that the retreat in U.S. yields since in the past week suggests that investors are coming to the conclusion that it is not just global factors that are likely to keep the Fed on hold this year. 
Many economists say the U.S. economy still lacks the investment that will drive greater underlying demand growth and the scale of popular concern over growth evident in the U.S. presidential campaign only argues against raising rates soon. 
With the global mood more uncertain, that may put Japan, traditionally a safe haven for capital in times of stress, in a yet tighter spot. Analysts believe it will be wary of intervening to offset flows of money into the yen before it hosts a G7 meeting later this month, but Tokyo is clearly unhappy with a 14 percent rise in the currency since December.
Hamada said on Tuesday Japan will step in to foreign exchange markets if the yen strengthens to 90-95 per dollar, even if that upsets the United States. 

""The tone of the verbal interventions has become much more outspoken over the past few days which no doubt has made some traders feel nervous,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note.

The currency pair traded between 1.1359 and 1.1408, before settling at 1.1372, down 0.10% on the session. The euro has now closed down against the dollar in sixth consecutive sessions, retreating from multi-month highs last week when it posted a six-day winning streak. Though the euro is down fractionally against its American counterpart over the last month, it is still up nearly 5% since the start of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said Tuesday that job openings in March rose by 149,000 on a seasonally-adjusted basis, lifting the job opening rate by 0.1% to 3.9%. Hiring rates, though, fell slightly by 0.1% to 3.7%, providing indications that employers experienced difficulty finding qualified workers. The report came in the wake of a relatively soft monthly employment report last week, which showed that nonfarm payrolls rose in April by the lowest level in seven months. Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said Tuesday that its GDPNow Forecast model now sees an increase of 2.2% in second quarter GDP, up from estimates of 1.7% on May 4.
The Federal Reserve has continually reiterated that it is taking a data-driven approach to the timing of its first interest rate hike in 2016. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.
Earlier, New York Fed president William Dudley noted in a closely-watched speech in Zurich that he doesn't believe the dollar would falter if other top currencies materialized as alternatives to the greenback as the world's reserve currency. Last Friday, Dudley emphasized that the U.S. central bank could still raise interest rates as much as twice this year in spite of soft employment figures in the Labor Department's April jobs report. The dollar has lost approximately 6% against its main rivals over the last five months.
""I don't see this as a zero-sum game,"" Dudley said. ""If other countries' currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses. I believe that the most important goal must be to keep our own house in order. If we do this, then I expect that the U.S. dollar will earn the right to remain the most important reserve currency in the world.""
Elsewhere, industrial production in Germany plunged 1.3% in March, down from declines of 0.7% a month earlier and sharply below consensus forecasts of Minus-0.3% for the month. Also in March, U.K.'s trade deficit for the first three months of the year surged to an 8-year high at GBP 13.3, its highest level since the Financial Crisis.

USD/JPY rose 0.45% to 108.80, the highest level since April 28 after ending the previous session with gains of 0.94%.
The dollar had fallen to 18-month lows of 105.05 against the yen last Tuesday after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged, defying market expectations for additional easing.
Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso said Monday that financial authorities are prepared to intervene in the currency market if excessive moves in the yen are enough to affect Japan’s economy.
The yen initially showed little reaction to the comments amid the view that Japanese officials are unlikely to take steps to weaken the currency in the absence of support for such a move.
Late last month the U.S. Treasury Department added Japan to a watch list of countries it is monitoring to gauge whether their foreign exchange policies provide an unfair trade advantage.
In its report, the Treasury noted that the current dollar-yen market was ""orderly"" and reiterated all countries must abide by G20 and G7 commitments on exchange rate policies, widely seen as a call for Japan to limit foreign exchange interventions.
Aso said Monday the Treasury’s move to put Japan on a watch list “won’t constrain” Tokyo’s currency policy.
Speaking Tuesday, Aso reiterated that Tokyo will intervene in the currency market if ""one-sided"" moves in the yen persist.
Also Tuesday, Japan’s Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara said he was closely watching financial markets after the yen’s gains last week.
The euro was also higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY rising 0.62% to 124.06 after ending Monday’s session with gains of 0.92%.

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen fell to its lowest in almost two weeks against the dollar on Tuesday following warnings by Japan that it was prepared to step in to weaken the currency.
The dollar rose 0.4 percent to a 12-day high of 108.895 yen , after surging more than 1 percent on Monday. The U.S. currency tumbled to an 18-month low of 105.55 yen last week after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy.
Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Monday that Tokyo was ready to intervene to weaken the currency if moves were volatile enough to hurt the country's trade and economy. He reiterated that message on Tuesday.
Traders said some speculators were cutting favorable bets on the yen, having piled into the currency in the past few weeks. [IMM/FX]
""Considering that speculative long positioning remains relatively sizeable, such comments should increase uncertainty among all those who remain long,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""We do not exclude further position squaring-related downside risks.""
Nevertheless, many believe the bar for intervention is high and unless the yen strengthens rapidly past 105 and towards the 100 mark against the dollar, authorities are likely to stay on the sidelines. 
""Japanese authorities will obviously never state what currency levels are important to them, but if you can read between the lines, 105 yen seems to be one of the watersheds,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, head of FX sales at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong.
Traders said Japan will also be wary of intervention before it hosts a G7 meeting later this month. Attendees at previous G7 meetings have frowned upon interventions, and Tokyo is sensitive to criticism that it is trying to engineer a weaker yen.
A recent U.S. Treasury report termed countries with substantial trade surpluses such as Japan which try to weaken their currencies through ""persistent one-sided"" intervention as manipulators. 
The euro rose 0.45 percent to a near two-week high of 124 yen (EURJPY=R), pulling further away from a three-year trough of 121.48 plumbed late last week.

The common currency was flat against the dollar at $1.1385 . The dollar index (DXY) was at 94.151, having hit its highest in nearly two weeks in the Asian trading session and extending its rise from a 15-month trough reached on May 3.

Reuters reported that Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday that Japan's financial authorities will intervene in the currency market if ""one-sided"" yen rises persist, in a repeat of comments made on Monday.
""Japan has not and has no plans to manipulate currency moves on a long-term basis,"" Aso told parliament, though he added that it was a shared understanding among G7 and G20 nations that excessive currency volatility was undesirable.
""Japan obviously will intervene if one-sided moves persist,"" he said. ""Currency moves have been one-sided and if this move accelerates, we're determined to stop it.""

321,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2016 10:29AM ET</span>","Yen tumbles on intervention warning, higher risk appetite ","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The yen hit a roughly two-week low against the dollar on Monday after Japan's finance minister said Tokyo was ready to intervene in the currency market if needed, with stronger risk sentiment also easing demand for traditional safe havens such as the Japanese currency. 
The yen hit an 18-month high against the dollar last week , having gained around 15 percent in the past six months in part because of waning investor expectations for a steady increase in U.S. interest rates.
That has prompted a ramping-up of intervention talk, with Finance Minister Taro Aso's comments on Monday following remarks last week from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said Japan was watching the yen's movements and would act if necessary.
Many investors believe, however, that the bar for intervention remains high and the comments were meant to talk down the yen.
""While actual currency intervention ahead of a G7 meeting later this month remains unlikely, there is a risk of either currency intervention or BOJ (Bank of Japan) monetary policy easing in the months ahead, a risk that is, at least for now, keeping the yen's upside limited,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
A recent U.S. Treasury report said ""persistent one-sided"" intervention by countries to weaken their currencies could result in those with big trade surpluses, such as Japan, being classified as manipulators - the latest sign U.S. officials are uncomfortable with more dollar gains. 
Nonetheless, the greenback rose more than 1 percent versus the yen to hit its strongest level since April 28, well clear of last week's low of 105.52 yen. The dollar was last up 1.3 percent at 108.55 yen. 
A tentative rise in risk appetite was partly tied to Wall Street's positive tone and a rebound in European stock markets from their worst week since early February. 
The dollar index touched a two-week high of 94.132 (DXY), showing a fairly muted reaction to Friday's U.S. jobs report. That put it well above a 16-month trough of 91.919 hit last week. The index was last up 0.3 percent at 94.115.
Also helping the dollar's rebound were remarks form New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, who said on Friday two U.S. rate hikes this year remained a ""reasonable expectation"".

The People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate  at 6.5105 per dollar prior to market open, 0.15 percent firmer than the previous fix 6.5202. 
Spot yuan  opened at 6.4960 per dollar and then fluctuated widely as traders rushed to adjust their positions after a flurry of worse-than-expected domestic economic data over the weekend.
The yuan consequently weakened on sour market sentiment and was changing hands at 6.5043 by midday, easing 0.21 percent from the previous close.
China's exports in April fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier, data showed on Sunday, reversing the previous month's brief rise, while imports dropped 10.9 percent from a year earlier, falling for the 18th consecutive month.
Central bank data showed on Saturday China's foreign exchange reserves rose in April to $3.22 trillion, marking a second monthly rise this year and suggesting the central bank is easing off its interventions as capital outflows ease.
The latest China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) data showed that the index for the yuan's value based on the market's trade-weighted basket <.CFSCNYI> stood at 96.61 last week, the lowest on record. The index was first published by CFETS in December 2015, setting the yuan's value at 100 at the end of 2014.
Still, a CFETS commentary said on Friday that the Chinese currency is relatively stable against the basket when inflation is included. 
Offshore yuan was trading 0.20 percent softer than the onshore spot at 6.5174 per dollar. 
Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts , considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan's value, traded at 6.6805, or 2.54 percent weaker than the midpoint.
The Chinese central bank's clampdown on bearish yuan speculators that stunted offshore trading has inadvertently injected new life into the sleepy non-deliverable forwards market.

The reserves stood at $3.2197 trillion at the end of last month, the world's highest, up from $3.2126 trillion at the end of March, according to data released on Saturday by the People's Bank of China.
Reserves in March rose $10.26 billion, the first increase in five months, which followed sharp draws of $107.9 billion in December and $99.5 billion in January, the two biggest drops on record.
The increase in forex reserves makes it less likely that the PBOC will cut the deposit reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks as it will not need to replenish liquidity in the financial system lost through capital outflows.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1387 and 1.1480, before settling at 1.1404, down 0.0001 or 0.01% on the session. With the miniscule losses, the euro fell for the fourth straight session against the dollar, continuing its pullback from 9-month highs in Tuesday's session when it eclipsed 1.16 for the first time since August. Over the last month, the euro is up fractionally against its American counterpart by 0.18%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said domestic nonfarm payrolls in April increased by 160,000, considerably below a downwardly revised gain of 209,000 in March and the lowest monthly total since last September. Analysts expected to see an increase of 200,000, in line with March's three-month average of 202,000. The losses were concentrated in mining, government and retail, partially offset by improved conditions in the Professional and Business Services industry.
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, remained unchanged at 5%, slightly above consensus forecasts for a 0.1% decline to 4.9%. In January, the unemployment rate in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in eight years. The U-6 unemployment rate, which also measures workers that are marginally attached to the labor market, fell 0.1 to 9.7%, sharply below last April's rate of 10.4%. By comparison, the Fed's preferred gauge of U.S. unemployment, peaked at 18% in 2010 at the end of the Financial Crisis.
Meanwhile, average hourly wages increased by 0.3% last month, in line with consensus estimates. The Labor Force Participation Rate fell by 0.2% to 62.8%, while the average workweek stayed unchanged at 34.5 hours per week.
While the Fed has voiced concern with the sluggish pace of inflation over the last several months, the U.S. central bank had expressed optimism with the broad improvement in the labor market prior to Friday's report.
In April, the FOMC said in its monetary policy statement that it will take a data-driven approach with the timing of its next interest rate hike. The FOMC's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of the Fed's three meetings this year. In December, the Fed ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
Although three top Wall Street firms lowered their expectations for the pace of the Fed's current tightening cycle, there were other indications on Friday that the U.S. central bank could leave a June rate hike on the table. In an interview with the New York Times following the jobs release, New York Fed president William Dudley said he is still reasonably confident that the Fed could raise rates as much as twice year.
Elsewhere, Retail PMI in the euro area slumped 1.3 points to 47.9, considerably below consensus' expectations for a 49.6 reading. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose three basis points to 1.73%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year gained three basis points to 0.14%. It came one day after the benchmark for global bond yields fell to 1.287%, percentage points from hitting all-time lows, according to Bloomberg.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.20% to an intraday low of 93.22, before rallying in the afternoon session to settle at 93.83, up 0.10% on the day. The index continues to hover near 9-month lows.

(Reuters) - Speculators increased bets against the U.S. dollar for the third straight week, taking the most net dollar short bets this week since Feb. 5, 2013, on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve would hold off on raising interest rates further this year.
The value of the dollar's net short positions rose to $6.46 billion in the week ended May 3, from $4.19 billion in short contracts the previous week, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. Prior to the current three-week bearish turn, speculators had been long the dollar since May 2014.
The dollar recovered late in the week after hitting its lowest point since January 2015 against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday. The dollar index rose nearly 1 percent, recovering from last week's decline that was the largest since early February. For the year, the greenback is down nearly 5 percent.
Much of the dollar's weakness has been tied to reduced bets that the Fed would not tighten credit this year.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged at its most recent policy meeting last week, and while it left the door open to a hike in June, its statement implied Fed officials were in no hurry to tighten credit after a rate hike in December.
U.S. data released since the meeting has been mixed with inflation indicators lagging. Fed funds futures rates show investors see less than a 10 percent chance that the U.S. central bank would raise rates in June and odds are close to 50-50 that it would not raise rates at all this year.
The reduced bets for dollar strength have helped the euro, as speculators' net short bets on the continental currency fell this week to their lowest since May 2014.
The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies on Friday, though it recouped much of its losses tied to news of slower-than-expected domestic job growth in April which supported ideas the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates in June.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against the euro, yen and four other currencies, was last down 0.1 percent at 93.696 (DXY). It had fallen as much as 0.6 percent earlier in the day, after the government said U.S. employers hired 160,000 workers in April, the fewest in seven months.
""It doesn't bode well for global growth,"" said Charles St-Arnaud, currency strategist at Nomura Securities International in New York. ""The Fed mostly likely won't be able to hike rates in June.""
U.S. interest rate futures suggested traders saw a 7 percent chance of the Fed raising rates at its June 14-15 meeting , down from 14 percent on Thursday, Reuters data showed.  
The initial selling of dollar linked to the latest payrolls report faded as some traders had scaled back their dollar holdings following a disappointing ADP private employment report on Wednesday, analysts said.
""The market already shifted down its expectations ahead of the release of the payrolls data. Investors are going flat heading into the weekend,"" St-Arnaud said.
While the job gains were below expectations, a bright spot in the report was a 0.3 percent increase in average hourly earnings.
""There is a tentative pickup in wage inflation so that’s encouraging,” said David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers in London.
The dollar index recovered about 2 percent from a trough of 91.919 hit Tuesday, its lowest point since January 2015.
The greenback was 0.6 percent lower against the yen at 106.60 yen <JPY=>. Friday's decline snapped a three-day winning streak which it retraced from an 18-month low of 105.55 struck on Tuesday. 
The euro, which rose to an eight-month peak of $1.1616 on Tuesday, was up 0.2 percent at $1.1424 <EUR=>.
Some large funds have been cutting bullish bets on the dollar amid uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will raise rates, analysts said.

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar shed 1.5 percent to $0.7354 after hitting a two-month low of $0.7338 . The Aussie was on track to fall 3.3 percent this week after the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed its inflation forecasts, hinting the door was open for another interest rate cut.

""The Reserve Bank of Australia’s new forecast that underlying inflation will remain below the 2-3% target range until the middle of 2018 supports our long-held view that interest rates will be cut again to 1.5% before long,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""After previously forecasting that underlying inflation would be 2.0% this year and around 2.5% next year, the RBA has concluded that it will stay at 1.5% in the second quarter and will stay below 2% all of next year. Part of the downward revision is due to the fact that underlying inflation fell much further than the RBA expected in the first quarter. But the Bank has also concluded that wage growth will remain lower for longer. The clear implication is that monetary policy will need to do more to boost underlying inflation. Tuesday’s 0.25% rate cut to 1.75% will probably be followed by another cut in August.""

The currency pair traded between 1.1386 and 1.1494, before settling at 1.1404, down 0.0087 or 0.72% on the session. With the sharp losses, the euro dipped below 1.14 against the dollar for the first time this month. EUR/USD has followed a six-day winning streak from last week with a modest losing skid over the last three sessions. Over the last month, the euro is virtually flat against its American counterpart – up 0.11% during that span.

On Thursday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said initial jobless claims increased by 17,000 to 274,000 last week, slightly above consensus estimates of 262,000. The amount represented the largest one-week spike in 16 months. Still, the 4-week Moving Average increased by only 2,000 to 258,000, remaining below the same measure a month ago. It came one day after the ADP Research Institute said private payrolls rose by 156,000 in April, sharply below consensus estimates of 193,000. Over the first three months of the year, the labor market has added an average of 202,000 private jobs per month.
When the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases its April jobs report on Friday morning, analysts expect an increase of 200,000 in nonfarm payrolls  following gains of 215,000 a month earlier. Economists are also anticipating a slight dip in the unemployment rate by 0.1% to 4.9%. The rate has lingered near multi-year lows over the last several months. More critically, analysts will keep a close eye on average hourly wages, which are expected to tick up by 0.3%, mirroring a considerable 0.3% uptick in March. Even as the U.S. economy has emerged from a prolonged recession, wages have remained stubbornly low since the Financial Crisis.
After holding short-term interest rates steady last month, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will take a data driven approach with the timing of its next rate hike. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its three meetings this year.
Speaking exclusively with CNBC on Thursday, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart said the Fed should ""keep the option open"" to consider raising short-term rates in June. At the same time, San Francisco president John Williams reiterated that he supports ""two to three rate hikes"" this year.
The FOMC's next meeting on June 14-15 will come days before a controversial referendum in the U.K. on its status in the European Union. A vote paving the way for a so-called ""Brexit,"" could have broad implications on global financial and foreign exchange markets. Earlier this week, Lockhart outlined the risk of Britain's departure from the EU at a closely-watched speech in Amelia Island, Florida.
""It is the repercussions for the U.S. economy that would concern me,"" Lockhart said. ""It's really a question of indications in financial markets of a reaction to rising uncertainty and the degree of volatility we are seeing again in financial markets.""

358,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2016 07:20PM ET</span>",Hong Kong cracks down on illegal money flows from China trade ,"By Saikat Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong is conducting a multi-pronged customs, shipping and financial sector crackdown against so-called fake trade invoicing that allows billions of dollars of capital to leave China illegally.
Hong Kong's central bank told Reuters it has beefed up its scrutiny of banks' trade financing operations, while customs officials are doing more random checks on shipments crossing border posts and conducting raids on warehouses to ensure the authenticity of goods, senior officials working in shipping, logistics and banking said. The head of a logistics company said surprise customs inspections at Hong Kong border posts had doubled.
The sources declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the issues.
They said the increased efforts began this year and reflected concerns about billions of dollars in illicit cash authorities suspect are being channeled through Hong Kong following a stock market crash in China last year.
""Examinations and investigations reflect one of the strongest trends we are seeing now in the financial sector,"" said Urszula McCormack, a partner at law firm King & Wood Mallesons, which helped co-author a report published by The Hong Kong Association of Banks in February that highlighted shipping as a sector where fake invoicing can thrive.
""(Hong Kong) regulators are now in enforcement mode.""
China has become increasingly concerned about capital outflows since the middle of last year when Chinese rushed to get money offshore for safekeeping or to invest following the stock market slump and unexpected yuan devaluation.
Hong Kong is the most popular route, analysts say, because of its proximity to China.
Chinese authorities have tried to staunch the outflows by tightening cross-border investment quotas, stepping up enforcement action of existing rules and restricting residents from buying financial products, such as insurance policies, offered in Hong Kong. But the trade channel had largely been left untouched given the complexity and magnitude of transactions involved.
A record net $674 billion left China last year, the International Institute of Finance estimates. A further $175 billion left China in the first quarter. China had been a long-term net importer of dollars.
While capital flows reflect legitimate business, analysts say the gap between trade figures reported by China and by Hong Kong for the same goods shows how imports and exports are being used to spirit cash offshore.
In December, for example, the gap between Chinese imports from Hong Kong and Hong Kong's exports to China - a rough indicator of capital flowing through trade - surged to a record $1.9 billion, which many economists attributed to falsifying trade invoices.
The December figures show that one dollar in every 10 of exports from Hong Kong to China may have been falsified to skirt China's capital controls, Thomson Reuters calculations show.
By March, the gap was still a relatively large $1.4 billion.
The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department said it was looking into the disparity between the trade figures in coordination with local and Chinese authorities. It said it would ""continue to maintain vigilance over the latest trends of money laundering"".
China's General Administration for Customs didn't respond to faxed questions.
The most popular way to fake invoices involves overstating the value of imports into China or under-stating the value of exports. A Chinese company could export goods to its Hong Kong subsidiary worth $100 each, but invoice the export at $80 each. The Hong Kong subsidiary sells them for $100 each and parks the profit in an offshore bank account.
The goods involved often lack an obvious value, such as jewellery or electronic components, making it difficult for customs officials or banks to spot a fake transaction.
""DETER AND DETECT""
Hong Kong's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), has increased the number of onsite inspections and asked banks to strengthen trade financing surveillance since the end of 2015, two bankers said.
""The HKMA has over the past years taken steps to require banks to implement better systems and controls to deter and detect suspicious transactions,"" Stewart McGlynn, the head of HKMA's anti-money laundering and financial crime risk said, referring to a doubling of suspicious transactions reported by banks to nearly 35,000 last year, compared with 2011.
China launched a nationwide operation called ""Nation's Blade"" in February to counter fake trade invoicing, tax evasion and smuggling. In the southwestern province of Yunnan, 459 cases are being investigated involving products worth around 30 million yuan, China media reported.
""Recently, there have been a lot of customs inspections with perhaps a 50 percent increase at times,"" said Alex Chen, a Shenzhen-based official at a customs brokerage firm, referring to Chinese customs actions. ""Lots of people are being caught under the latest operation and many have been fined as well.""
Trade sources said the crackdown is also being seen in other ways.
""Ever since the capital outflow problems, it has become very difficult to interact with the Chinese customs (officials),"" said the head of logistics at a Hong Kong firm.

""Companies on both sides of the border would take them out for wining and dining (before) ... But now they don't want to be seen with us.""

The currency pair traded between 1.1467 and 1.1528, before settling at 1.1490, down 0.0012 or 0.06% on the session. Despite the slight losses, the euro has closed higher against the dollar in 10 of the last 15. It came one session after the euro surged above 1.16 for the first time in nine months, before halting a six-day winning streak. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Wednesday morning, financial information services provider Markit said business activity rebounded in April as new employment opportunities rose at a modest pace, while input cost inflation picked up at its fastest rate in more than a year. As a result, Markit's U.S. Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 52.8 for April, up 0.7 from the flash reading earlier in the month. Analysts expected a consensus of 52.0, following March's final reading of 51.3. At the same time, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its Non-Manufacturing Index surged 1.2 points to 55.7 in April, far exceeding forecasts for a 54.7 reading. The gains were concentrated in new orders, which surged three points to 59.9, delivering its highest rate of growth since October.
Meanwhile, though factory orders rose by 1.1% in March, they followed a downwardly revised decline of 1.9% over the previous month. Within the report, defense goods jumped by 49% amid an uptick in defense aircraft orders. While the dollar bounced off near 9-month lows on Wednesday, further gains were softened by relatively weak employment figures ahead of Friday's monthly report from the Labor Department. In a monthly report, the ADP Research Institute said private payroll rose by 156,000 in April, sharply below consensus estimates of 193,000. Over the first three months of the Year, the labor market has added an average of 202,000 private jobs per month.
After leaving short-term interest rates steady in April for the third consecutive meeting this year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sent broad indications that will take a data-driven approach with the timing of future rate increases. While the Fed has been pleased with solid improvements in the labor market, it has expressed concern with the slow pace of gains in inflation. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
USD/JPY surged more than 0.55% to an intraday high of 107.36, bouncing off 18-month lows from the previous day, before settling at 107.02.

361,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2016 10:34AM ET</span>","Respite for the dollar after euro, yen surge","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen and the euro both retreated from long-term highs against the dollar on Wednesday as markets looked to a series of U.S. jobs releases due by the end of the week for fresh direction. 
Measuring by the trade-weighted index used by the European Central Bank , the euro rose on Tuesday past levels around 96 assumed by the bank in its last forecasts, spurring speculation officials may seek to talk the currency down. 
The bigger debate for the moment is the yen, up 14 percent against the dollar since mid-December, and the chances of either outright intervention or, at some stage, far more aggressive policy action from the Bank of Japan to weaken it.
A U.S. Treasury report on Friday sent a warning shot by saying that ""persistent one-sided"" intervention to weaken the currency could see countries with big trade surpluses classified as currency manipulators and demand action. 
No one expects it to come to that. But the report was taken as another sign that U.S. officials are not comfortable with more dollar gains. The greenback hit an almost 19-month low of 105.55 yen overnight, having hit its weakest against the euro since last August on Tuesday. 
Against that were comments by San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams that he would vote for a rise in interest rates in June if economic growth was on track with his forecast and jobs gains continue.
""There is the feeling that the activity by the U.S. Treasury could have taken us into oversold territory with respect to the dollar,"" Rabobank strategist Jane Foley said.
""We have ADP jobs numbers today and then obviously we are thinking about payrolls on Friday. If they are strong again, does that push expectations for a rate rise higher again, does it create more dollar strength? It will be interesting to see.""
The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 106.75 yen , off earlier highs, by 1125 GMT. It was up marginally on the day at $1.1491 per euro, compared with Tuesday's low of $1.1616. 
The gains against the yen came in thin market conditions, with Japanese markets closed on Wednesday and Thursday for public holidays.
The yen last week saw its biggest weekly gain since 2008 - more than 5 percent against the dollar - as the Bank of Japan held off from expanding its stimulus. 
Position squaring ahead of U.S. jobs data later in the week is probably supporting the dollar against the yen for now, said Stephen Innes, senior trader for FX broker OANDA in Singapore.
""There's a huge, huge short position built into dollar/yen right now,"" Innes said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists called the yen higher in the short term but said that would only put more pressure on policymakers to take aggressive action later that would weaken it. 
""There is little doubt in our minds that the dollar will keep falling against the yen in the near term, until (BOJ) Governor Kuroda is forced to respond with overwhelming force,"" they said in a note. 

Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 93.117 (DXY).

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.14% to 93.14.
The index had hit a low of 91.89 on Tuesday, the weakest level since January 2015.

The report was seen as likely to boost up the government’s revisions to first quarter growth.

Payrolls processor ADP said nonfarm payrolls rose by 156,000 last month, the smallest increase since April 2013 and well below forecasts for jobs growth of 196,000.
Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised down to 194,000 from an originally reported 200,000 increase.
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. government’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which is expected to show that the economy added 202,000 jobs last month.

364,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2016 09:20AM ET</span>","Latam forex outlook limited by Brazil's fiscal worries, Fed doubts: Reuters Poll","By Gabriel Burin
(Reuters) - The outlook for Latin American currencies has improved further, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, but questions about the ability of Brazil's likely new government to plug a massive budget deficit stand in the way of future gains.
The possibility of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve next month could also hit the region's currencies, which have strengthened for three months in a row along with a global rally in riskier assets. 
Local markets also got a lift from hopes for policy change in Brazil, where Vice President Michel Temer, perceived as more friendly to investors, is expected to replace beleaguered President Dilma Rousseff next week.
Median estimates from the 46 foreign exchange strategists in the poll reflected that extended optimism.
The Brazilian real  was projected at 3.90 per dollar in 12 months, 3.2 percent stronger than in April's one-year view. The weakest forecast was 4.60, and the strongest was 3.25.
The strategists pegged the Mexican peso  at 17.25, up 0.9 percent from last month. Forecasts ranged from 19.00 to 15.00. 
Estimates were practically unchanged for the Chilean peso  at 685.0, the Colombian peso  at 3,000 and the Peruvian sol  at 3.53.
In Brazil, the worst recession in a century opened a huge budget deficit and cost the nation its prized investment-grade ratings last year. Temer's aides have emphasized the need to rein in debt but suggested no new taxes in the short term.
Any new government in Brazil ""would have to prove that it is capable of stabilizing fiscal dynamics in the years to come,"" said strategist Andres Jaime Martinez of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
Rousseff is set to be suspended from office next week for allegedly breaking budget laws. A final decision on her impeachment by the Senate could take six months.
The U.S. central bank is another source of uncertainty after three months of relative calm. Taking a firmer stand than in March, the Fed noted in its policy statement last month that the labor market had improved and removed references to fears stemming from China. 
It added that it was keeping a close eye on inflation, leaving the door open to a rate hike next month.
""Although monetary policy normalization in the U.S. is poised to be very gradual, markets already price a very benign scenario,"" said Martinez.
A sense of caution remained present in comments from all Latin American capitals. 
In Bogota, Catalina Guevara at Alianza Valores brokerage said: ""It's hard to think that the depreciation of the Colombian peso is over, considering U.S. monetary policy and oil prices, which face oversupply and years of weak demand.""
The median forecast for the Argentine peso  in one year was at 16.75. 

""We expect a mild spike in the foreign exchange rate (against the peso) in coming weeks as soon as the central bank cuts the policy rate in response to a slowdown in core inflation,"" said Miguel Zielonka, associate director at Econviews in Buenos Aires.

366,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2016 08:10AM ET</span>","Yen, euro set to weaken, but not because of BOJ, ECB policy: Reuters poll","By Sumanta Dey
(Reuters) - The Japanese yen is set to fall about 8 percent against the U.S. dollar over the coming year, said strategists in a Reuters poll, although many of them argue that Japanese policymakers are not likely to succeed in trying to engineer that outcome.
FX analysts are clinging to their weaker yen outlook, mostly on account of a stronger dollar view, despite a blistering rally in the yen over the past three months which came on the heels of a shock Bank of Japan decision to adopt negative interest rates.
In the meantime the BOJ has opted to provide no large new stimulus through its asset purchase program, a stance which emboldened many traders to push the yen  to 18-month highs last week.
Data from the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission showed that U.S. dollar net short positions are at their highest in more than three years and net long bets on the yen are at their second highest ever.
That surge in bets, coupled with the BOJ holding fire, has helped to trim the scale of analysts' calls for a weaker yen.
In the survey of close to 70 foreign exchange strategists, taken during the period April 28-May 4, the yen is forecast to fall to 115 per dollar by end-April 2017, something they had predicted in last month's poll would happen by end-September.
On Wednesday the yen was trading near 107 per dollar.
But considering the poor track record forecasters have over the past year -- they had a 12-month call of 127 yen per dollar last May -- the bias for persisting with lower yen calls is a fraught one, especially given that the timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve's next rate hike remains uncertain.
On a separate question in the latest survey, the consensus among 23 respondents found that dollar/yen at 100 was the red line for Japanese policymakers. 
A strong yen was a big factor behind the launch of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" economic stimulus program back in early 2013, when dollar/yen was below 90.
""Seeing the limitations of monetary policy in terms of influencing the exchange rate, even if the BOJ introduces more stimulus, we don't expect it to have a big impact on the yen,"" said Khoon Goh, ANZ's senior FX strategist for Asia.
ANZ was the only respondent in the sample of more than 60 who predicted the yen would rise to 100 per dollar in a year.
Asked what would be the most effective way for Japanese policymakers to weaken the yen, about a third of analysts said they would not succeed, no matter what they did.
Another third of the analysts said the most effective policy would be for the BOJ to significantly ramp up its asset purchases either on its own or combined with a lower negative deposit rate.
Most of the remaining respondents picked intervention in foreign exchange markets, which has been the subject of much speculation recently. 
The BOJ has printed trillions of yen for the better part of the last two decades, buying everything from government bonds to exchange-traded funds, hoping the stimulus would find its way into the economy, end deflation and boost growth.
But apart from bloating its balance sheet to nearly 70 percent of Japan's gross domestic product and fuelling rallies in equities, the stimulus has not achieved much.
EURO TO SLIP TOO, BUT NOT BY MUCH
Similar to the BOJ, the European Central Bank also has a negative deposit rate and is buying 80 billion euros a month of mainly sovereign bonds. It will soon start buying corporate bonds.
Yet by end-April 2017 the euro is only predicted to go back to where it started this year -- $1.08, a fall of about six percent from $1.15 on Wednesday.
Only six strategists calling for the euro to reach or fall below parity to the dollar over the coming year are left in the sample, compared with 21 this time last year.
While nearly all central banks say they don't target them, a weaker exchange rate is crucial for the success of the BOJ and ECB's policies since it helps to import inflation and aids exports by making them relatively cheaper on global markets.
But the poll conclusions suggest the BOJ and ECB have little influence on the exchange rates of their respective currencies, which will more likely be affected by what the U.S. Federal Reserve does next with interest rates.
""The failure by the BOJ to act will now inevitably play into investor fears that 'Abenomics' is unraveling and that the BOJ is falling behind the curve,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTMU in London.
A June Fed rate hike is still the main call among economists polled by Reuters last month, although their conviction is fading. Financial markets on the other hand are pricing in only a single hike for the year and that only in December. [ECILT/US]

369,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2016 04:03AM ET</span>","Yuan, rupee forecast to weaken slightly over coming year: Reuters poll ","By Sumanta Dey
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for major Asian currencies has stayed remarkably stable, according to a Reuters poll of strategists, despite the Japanese yen's explosive rally and with forecasts hinging on U.S. central bank policy expectations.
China's yuan is forecast to weaken slightly against the dollar over the coming year, while the Indian rupee and South Korean won are expected to slip a bit as well, views that haven't changed much since the start of the year.
But where each currency goes depends more on the timing of the next U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike, currently tipped for June, than on the trajectory of domestic monetary policy.
Pressure on the yuan  has ebbed in the past few months on views the Fed may raise rates more gradually this year, which has held back the dollar, and as the People's Bank of China (PBoC) continues to clamp down on financial market speculation.
""While China's economy appeared to have stabilized lately, worries over longer term structural problems have not gone away,"" said Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS in Singapore.
""There is incentive for China to not only keep the yuan stable, but also keep the spread between the onshore CNY and offshore CNH narrow.""
The yuan, also called the renminbi, is traded both within China and outside, mostly in Hong Kong, where it is free of the PBoC's restrictions that stipulate the currency can move only within 2 percent of its daily mid-point fixing on either side.
In January, when China roiled global markets by allowing the yuan to slide sharply, speculators piled on bets that another devaluation was imminent.
That sent the spread between the offshore and onshore rates to its widest in many years, but it has narrowed since, especially after the PBoC allowed the yuan to trade both ways.
The consensus from over 50 currency strategists polled April 28 - May 4 is the yuan will likely trade at 6.50 by end-May, near Wednesday's 6.497, easing steadily to 6.65 by end-October and 6.72 by end-April 2017.
While that 12-month consensus is still about 3 percent lower than the current rate, analysts have held on to that view for three monthly polls now, suggesting forecasters mostly think a steady depreciation is more likely rather than a sharp fall.
The most pessimistic call was 7.60 in a year, similar to last month's poll.
The PBoC is expected to ease policy further this year in an effort to boost growth and that is likely to drag the yuan lower. 
The dollar's fortunes, however, will be key.
While a Fed hike in June is still the main call for a majority of economists polled by Reuters, their conviction appears to be wavering. Whether or not the economy picks up from a sharp slowdown in the first quarter will matter a great deal.
Still, the long view is that the dollar will rise modestly through the coming year, especially as almost every other major central bank eases policy to combat weak inflation and boost growth. The Reserve Bank of Australia was the latest major central bank to do so, unexpectedly cutting its cash rate to a record low of 1.75 percent this week.
The Indian rupee  is also forecast to weaken to 68.00 per dollar in six months, and then hold steady until end-April next year.
Growth in Asia's third largest economy will remain one the fastest in the world this year, economists predict, and with inflation in control, they expect the Reserve Bank of India to cut its lending rate in the last quarter of 2016. 

The South Korean won  will likely fall to 1190 in a year, 3 percent down from Wednesday's rate of 1154 and similar to expectations last month.

USD/JPY changed hands at 106.74, up 0.11%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7498, up 0.20%.
Jobs data from New Zealand saw the unemployment rate tick up to 5.7% in the first quarter from 5.3% previously and above the 5.5% expected, with the labor cost index for the first quarter up 1.8% year-on-year, above the 1.6% level seen.
The employment change showed a 1.2% gain quarter-on-quarter, well above the 0.7% expected with a participation rate at 69%, above the 68.6% seen.
NZD/USD traded at 0.6929, up 0.22% after the data, which outside of the rise in unemployment was viewed as upbeat.
""The sharper-than-expected rise in the New Zealand unemployment rate in the first quarter reversed half of the large decline at the end of last year and suggests that the previous improvement was more a mirage than a miracle. But the RBNZ will be more concerned to see that wage growth has continued to remain subdued,"" Capital Economic said in a note to clients.
The AIG Services Index for April in Australia is ahead with the previous month reading at 49.5.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last quoted at 93.02.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1496 and 1.1615, before settling at 1.1498, down 0.22% on the session. At session-highs, the euro extended gains from the last week to move above 1.16 for the first time since last-August's Flash Crash when the currency pair surged approximately 5% in a span of four trading days. With the slight losses, the euro halted a six-day losing against the dollar. Over the last month, the euro gained roughly 1% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Tuesday morning, the European Commission downgraded its annual GDP growth outlook citing weakness in China, subdued performance among key trade partners and lagging investments. In its 2016 spring forecast the 19-nation bloc lowered full-year economic growth to 1.6%, slightly below previous estimates of 1.7%. At the same time, the European Commission expects consumer prices to tick up by 0.2%, sharply below previous expectations of 0.5%.
""The economic recovery in Europe continues but the global context is less conducive than it was,"" European Commissioner vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the dollar received a boost on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a new record-low of 1.75%. As a result, the dollar surged versus a host of currency from commodity-dependent economies. AUD/USD fell more than 2.3% to an intraday-low of 0.7490, its lowest level in more than three weeks. USD/NZD lost more than 1.4% to an intra-session low of 0.6922, while USD/CAD gained more than 1.3% to a session-high of 1.2701.
The Japanese Yen soared to fresh 18-month highs against the dollar at ¥105.55, amid heightened skepticism from currency traders on added intervention from the Bank of Japan in the coming months, resulting in sharp devaluations in the safe-haven currency. Last week, USD/JPY plummeted nearly 5% in consecutive sessions after the BOJ roiled global foreign exchange markets with a surprising move to leave its benchmark interest rate at record-lows.
Elsewhere, investors parsed comments from a pair of key Federal Reserve policymakers for clues on the timing of further tightening from the U.S. central bank. On Tuesday morning, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart told reporters at the 21st Annual Financial Markets Conference outside of Jacksonville, Florida, that although it is still possible for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates this year, any rate hikes ""depend entirely on how the economy evolves."" Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held its benchmark Fed Funds Rate at its current targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%, citing an uncertain economic and inflationary outlook. Lockhart is a non-voting of the FOMC during the current cycle.
When the Fed ended a six-year Quantitative Easing program in October, 2014, Core PCE inflation stood at 1.6%, slightly below its targeted 2% objective. When the U.S. Commerce Department released its Core PCE price index last week for April, the reading was virtually unchanged from its level 21 months earlier. At a separate panel during Tuesday's conference, Fed Cleveland president Loretta Mester, a voting member, emphasized that there's ""convincing evidence,"" that Quantitative Easing is not infinite. Core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge of price stability, strips out volatile food and energy prices.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.25% to an intraday high of 92.92. The index, which is down more than 7% since early-December, halted a six-day losing streak."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The yen jumped to an 18-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, extending gains on persistent doubts the Bank of Japan will intervene to stem a dramatic rise that has undermined attempts to reflate the world's third-biggest economy.
The yen has risen over 12 percent against the dollar so far this year. Further gains would intensify speculation of BOJ intervention sooner rather than later, as Japanese politicians have raised concerns about the yen's run-up.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to visit Italy and Germany in a tour some believe he will use to try to set the stage for possible intervention in currency markets as Japan prepares to host a G7 meeting this month.
Attendees at previous G7 meetings have frowned upon intervention, and Tokyo is sensitive to criticism it is trying to engineer a weaker yen through ultra-loose monetary policy.
""It makes it more difficult for Japan to intervene in the near term,"" said Ian Gordon, G10 FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
Last week, the dollar booked its biggest weekly drop since 2008, more than 5 percent against the yen.
The greenback was little changed at 106.45 yen  after hitting its lowest since October 2014, while the euro slipped 0.3 percent to 122.51 yen (EURJPY=), hovering near its weakest levels in three years. 
Renewed anxiety about sluggish global growth stoked a selloff in stock and commodity markets worldwide, pushing investors to the safety of low-yielding, liquid currencies. [MKTS/GLOB]
The euro, another low-yielding currency like the yen, reached $1.1616 , its highest since August before fading to $1.1506, down 0.2 percent.
The euro's turnaround partly fed a rebound in the dollar index (DXY), which hit its lowest in over 15 months before finishing up 0.35 percent at 92.949. 
Sterling retreated from a four-month peak as a poll showed British voters who favor leaving the European Union hold a razor-thin edge over those who want to stay. The pound  was down 0.9 percent at $1.4540.
Losses in oil  and metal markets slammed commodity sensitive currencies including Canadian , Australian  and New Zealand dollars .
The Australian dollar initially tumbled after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by 25 basis points to record lows 1.75 percent, with traders expecting more easing to fight deflation.

The Aussie dollar lost 2.3 percent to $0.7486 , hitting its lowest in over five weeks.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1448 and 1.1536, before settling at 1.1530, up 0.0070 or 0.59% on the session. The euro has closed higher against the dollar in each of the last seven sessions and 10 of the last 13. Over the last month, the euro has gained more than 1.2% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
The dollar remained at its lowest levels since last summer on Monday, as the slumping manufacturing sector showed little signs of improving. On Monday morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its Manufacturing Index for the month of April fell 1.0 to 50.8, below consensus forecasts for a reading of 51.4. Within the report, supplier deliveries plunged 1.1 points, underscoring low inventory levels throughout the sector and dragging down the composite index. New orders also slowed by 2.5%, while employment remained in contraction despite a gain of 1.1 points.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.55% to an intraday low of 92.52, before settling near session-lows at 92.53. At one point, the index fell to its lowest level since last July. Over the last six sessions, the dollar has tumbled more than 2.5%.
As a result, the yen rose to fresh 18-month highs against the dollar at ¥106.16 as investors continued to digest broad signals that the Bank of Japan will not intervene in global foreign exchange markets in the coming weeks to weaken its currency. Last Thursday, the BOJ rattled global markets with a surprising decision not to implement further easing measures in an effort to stave off deflation.
One day earlier, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its April's monetary policy meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left interest rates steady in each of its three meetings this year. At the meeting, the Fed also indicated that it will remain data dependent with the timing of future interest rate decisions. Any interest rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
In the euro area, Markit's Manufacturing PMI index for April ticked up 0.2 to 51.7, above analysts' expectations for slight gains to 51.6. Elsewhere, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi fired back at critics of the central bank's easy monetary policies at a closely-watched speech in Frankfurt. Draghi, who has come under attack from senior officials in Germany since the ECB ramped up its €1.5 trillion asset-purchasing program in March, emphasized that low interest rates are the result of an underlying economic problem and that investors in Germany should respond by developing diversified savings patterns comparable to their counterparts back in the U.S. At a ceremony organized by a top euro area think-tank in early-April, German Wolfgang Schäuble blamed the ECB's ultra-low rates for causing undue harm on the nation's savers.
""Those advocating a lesser role for monetary policy or a shorter period of monetary expansion necessarily imply a larger role for fiscal policy,"" Draghi said.
The euro has gained more than 3% against the dollar since the ECB approved a wide range of stimulus measures on March 10."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Monday from its biggest weekly fall in more than seven years against the yen but softened against other major currencies, in particular the euro, which was helped by stronger German manufacturing data.
Worries over Japanese policymakers' inability to stem the yen's rise pushed the dollar to an 18-month low of 106.14 yen  in the first hours of Asian trade. It later bounced to 106.78 yen, up 0.4 percent on the day.
Finance Minister Taro Aso was quoted in Japanese media over the weekend as saying he viewed the yen's strength as ""extremely concerning,"" stoking speculation the Bank of Japan might intervene to stem the currency's rise.
""It contributed to the performance of the yen, while we are seeing the dollar softer against other currencies,"" said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
The dollar index dipped 0.35 percent to 92.747 (DXY) after hitting its lowest since January 2015 at 92.568.
The greenback has fallen since mid-March after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled the Fed would proceed with further rate increases with ""caution.""
The dollar's weakness intensified following the BOJ's surprise inaction on further stimulus at its policy meeting last week.
""One can only imagine that they did not want a stronger yen, but the authorities there caused it by taking no action last week,"" Thu Lan Nguyen, a strategist with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt, said of Aso's comments. 
Last week's nearly 5 percent gain for the yen was its biggest since the 2008 crisis and pushed ""long"" bets on more gains to the highest on record. This raised the risk the dollar could weaken to 100 yen, some analysts said. [IMM/FX]
With British markets closed for a holiday on Monday, sterling reached a five-month peak versus the dollar on receding worries about the ""Brexit"" referendum on June 23. The pound was last up 0.3 percent at $1.4653 .
Monday's data on global manufacturing supported the notion of sluggish global growth. U.S. factory growth slowed more than expected in April, while Chinese manufacturing activity expanded only marginally. 
German factory data, while marginally below forecast, showed the sector grew solidly. That lifted the euro to $1.1532 , the highest since late August, according to Reuters data.

An Australian central bank meeting will be a focus on Tuesday. The Aussie dollar  was up 0.1 percent at $0.7615 on Monday, adding to an 11 percent surge since hitting multi-year lows in January.

401,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2016 06:13PM ET</span>","EUR/USD surges to 7-month high, as soft inflation data sinks the dollar","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose sharply on Friday extending a five-day winning session, as stronger than expected GDP figures in the euro zone were met with soft consumer spending data in the U.S., sending the euro soaring to seven-month highs against the dollar. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1349 and 1.1459, before settling at 1.1454, up 0.0102 or 0.90% on the session. With the considerable gains, the euro reached its highest level against the dollar since October 15. The euro ended April up by roughly 0.65% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1625, the high from Aug. 25. 
The dollar moved lower in overnight trading after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) jolted foreign exchange markets by fixing the yuan 0.56% higher against the dollar, its strongest one-day move since 2005 when it decoupled with the dollar. The move came in the wake of two closely-watched central bank meetings earlier this week when the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan both stood pat by leaving their benchmark interest rates unchanged.
In European morning trading, Eurostat announced that GDP in the euro zone during the first quarter rose by 1.6%, above consensus forecasts of 1.4%. It came as unemployment throughout the zone fell by 0.2 to 10.2%, below analysts' expectations of 10.2%. In April, inflation in the euro area fell by 0.2%, slightly below consensus estimates of a 0.1% decline, one month after March's flat reading. 
The greenback extended its slide following the release of soft economic data in the U.S. On Friday morning, the Commerce Department said its Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index in March rose by 0.8% on an annual basis, down slightly from February's annual gains of 1.0%. The Core PCE Index, meanwhile, increased by 1.6%, also lower compared with the previous month's level of 1.7%. Core PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation. The dollar then hit session-lows after the University of Michigan said consumer sentiment in April fell 0.7 to 89.0, dropping to a seven-month low. Analysts expected to see gains of 0.7 to 90.4.
While core inflation surged to its highest annual level since 2012 in January, it has still remained below the Fed's 2% objective for every month over the last three years. Hawkish members of the Fed have sent some indications they could support an interest rate hike in June if they receive signals that inflation is firming over the next two months. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan said on Friday that he could support further monetary policy in June or July if the U.S. economy shows signs of improvement during the second quarter. Addressing reporters on the sidelines of an OMFIF event in London, Kaplan noted that the UK's referendum on a departure from the European Union could impact the timing of the Fed's next rate hike. A potential Brexit could create a ""sudden depreciation,"" in the pound, Kaplan said, creating a ripple effect throughout the global economy. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.60% to an intraday low of 92.98, its lowest level since last July. The index, which settled at 93.03, is down 7% since the start of December.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2016 04:30PM ET</span>","Dollar net shorts hit highest in over 3 years: CFTC, Reuters","(Reuters) - Speculators' bearish bets on the U.S. dollar hit their largest since February 2013, boosted by expectations that the Federal Reserve will take its time in raising interest rates this year, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
The value of the dollar's net short position rose to $4.19 billion in the week ended April 26, from short contracts valued at $1.85 billion in the previous week. Speculators were short the dollar for a second straight week.
So far in 2016, the dollar has fallen 5.7 percent after gaining more than 9 percent last year. The dollar was on track for its worst yearly performance since 2007.
The culprit has been a generally dovish Fed that has been proceeding with caution on raising interest rates given persistent global risks to the U.S. economy.
The U.S. central bank held interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and while it left the door open to a hike in June, its statement implied it was in no hurry to follow on from its December rate hike.
""The U.S. dollar has remained under pressure in the aftermath of the FOMC decision, with a rising inflation expectations and falling U.S. nominal yields depressing U.S. real rates,"" wrote  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in a research note.
""We expect this process to continue in the week ahead, with softer readings on Monday's manufacturing and Friday's (U.S.) jobs report likely to bolster Fed concerns about slowing U.S. activity.""
In other currencies, euro net shorts continued to decline, to their lowest in nearly two years. Net euro shorts fell to 39,667 contracts, from 46,917 short contracts the week before.
BNP Paribas expects an improving outlook for the euro against the dollar. 
""We remain long this pair (EUR/USD), targeting a move up to $1.16,"" the French bank said.

The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 89.0 in April from 89.7 the previous month, disappointing expectations for a rise to 90.0.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>",China forex regulator eases restrictions on bank FX positions ,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange regulator said on Friday it will allow banks to issue more FX-related products for risk-hedging purposes.
That includes allowing banks to hold bigger short-dollar positions at the end of the day, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement on its website.
The regulator said the change would help maintain onshore liquidity of foreign currency and help reduce exchange rate risk.
The adjustment comes as the yuan remains under depreciation pressure as Beijing remains in a monetary easing stance while the U.S. Fed contemplates raising rates, which would further support the dollar.
That provides policy space for SAFE to allow banks more latitude shorting the dollar.
China will further step up monitoring of trade-related investment, the regulator also said.

Trade transactions have in the past been used as a mechanism to conceal capital inflows and outflows.

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen built further on Friday on a round of strong gains since the Bank of Japan meeting, moving to an 18-month high against the dollar and on course to rack up its biggest weekly gain since the 2008 financial crisis.
Poor U.S. growth numbers and the cautious tone taken by the Federal Reserve this week has squeezed hedge funds still backing a stronger dollar in the face of a market positioned negatively on the U.S. currency for the first time in a year. [IMM/FX]
By 0726 GMT, the euro was up 0.25 percent against the greenback, helping push the dollar index a third of a percent lower. Sterling, relieved by an easing of Brexit nerves in the past two weeks, hit a 3-month high of $1.4658
""If you were a dollar bull you were holding on for some support from the Fed this week. When it didn't quite materialize, people just gave up,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment at currency managers Millennium Global.
""If you ask me there is some significant nuance (taking us closer to a June hike) in what the Fed said. They maybe thought that statement would lead to people pricing it at 50-50 but the market just did not want to know.""
The yen rose 3 percent against the dollar on Thursday in the wake of the Bank of Japan's decision to hold off from expanding its monetary stimulus further.
Some Japanese banks are skeptical on the yen's ability to gain further and many say the scale of the yen's move is rather a reflection of the lack of faith in the dollar. 
But a year on from a German government bond sell-off that rocked markets, and with U.S. stocks at record highs and the U.S. economy showing signs of weakening, there are also some concerns that May could bring another global market wobble. 
The first quarter GDP data on Thursday showed growth of just 0.5 percent in annualized terms.
""The dollar has really lost a lot of momentum,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia FX and rates strategy for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Singapore.
A key theme for the yen is whether the BOJ's decision to stand pat on Thursday is just a wait-and-see stance, or whether it means the bar will be higher for any further stimulus, said Stephen Innes, senior trader for FX broker OANDA in Singapore.
""Obviously, if anybody sides with the ineffectiveness of the current monetary policy and the likelihood that the bar is going to be pushed higher for any further easing, it doesn't bode well for dollar/yen recovery,"" Innes said.

The yen also pushed higher against the euro, which fell 0.6 percent to 122.01 yen (EURJPY=R). On Thursday, the euro shed 2.7 percent versus the yen.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2016 03:50AM ET</span>","After Bank of Japan hesitates over easing, markets test its resolve by driving up yen","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's shock decision this week not to provide additional stimulus to the struggling Japanese economy has prompted some investors and traders to bet that policy makers are out of bullets, clearing the path for further gains in the yen.
After BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Thursday dashed expectations of more easing, the yen has been on a tear. It yen spiked 2.6 percent to 108.11 against the U.S. dollar  straight after the decision to post its biggest daily gain in more than five years and pushed on to an 18-month peak of 107.075 per dollar on Friday. A stronger yen is punishing Japanese exporters and left the Nikkei share index (N225) down 5 percent for the week.
Kuroda has been at the forefront of Japan's efforts to escape the debilitating drag of deflation, launching massive asset buying campaigns before taking interest rates negative earlier this year.
For him to pause on policy, even if only to gauge the impact of past easing, alarmed markets addicted to ever-more aggressive and exotic stimulus measures from the world's boldest central bank.
""The sneaking doubt here is that perhaps we're witnessing the end of the great monetary easing experiment and that's obviously a very dangerous path for the BOJ,"" says Frederic Neumann, HSBC's co-head Of Asian economic research in Hong Kong.
""The pressure will only grow for the BOJ to do more,"" he adds. ""Without any further action, it is fairly likely that the yen would continue its upward trajectory and equities will continue to be under pressure.""
Kuroda did on Thursday leave the door open for more stimulus, stressing there were no limits to what monetary policy can do to address strong risks to the outlook.
""There's absolutely no change to our stance of aiming to achieve 2 percent inflation at the earliest date possible, and to do whatever it takes to achieve this,"" he told a news conference. ""If needed, we can deepen negative rates much more.""
The BOJ cut its inflation forecasts in a quarterly review of its projections, also on Thursday. And it again pushed back the timing for hitting its 2 percent price target, by six months, saying it may not happen until March 2018 at the latest.
The yen's resurgence was also an echo of the euro's reaction in March when European Central Bank Governor Mario Draghi said that further cuts in interest rates would not be needed.
Despite launching an expanded package of asset buying, the market took the euro almost 2 percent higher that day and the single currency has been on the rise since.
Just Friday, the ECB's chief economist, Peter Praet, told a Spanish newspaper that the inflation outlook would have to worsen significantly to warrant another rate cut.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has already started to turn off the spigots pouring money into the global economy with its halt to new quantitative easing and interest rate rise late last year.
THE END OF GLOBAL STIMULUS?
""We have now seen both the ECB and BOJ show a degree of reluctance to deliver further easing, despite ongoing inflation weakness and currency strength,"" said David Cannington, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.
""Is it a sign that the significant and unprecedented monetary policy action globally is drawing to a close?"" he asked. 
He said that if that was the case, some of the distortions these policies have created, particularly in currencies, could dissipate.
Others, however, argue that policy easings take time to have an impact, often months, and it was only reasonable for central banks to pause to weigh whether they were working.
Some also said they suspected Kuroda wanted to launch the sort of shock and awe campaign that had an actual chance of shaking the Japanese public out of its deflationary mindset. That meant waiting for the right moment rather than taking piecemeal steps.
""Even as markets brood over being snubbed by the BOJ, the broader perspective is that the BOJ simply deferred, rather than decided against, further stimulus,"" argued analysts at Mizuho.
They say they believe Kuroda was readying for major action mid-year, when the case for bold moves would be reinforced by softer inflation and chronic weakness in industries and exports.

""If so, it could prove to be one sweet summer for BOJ trades - short-yen and long-Nikkei.""

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1296 and 1.1368, before settling at 1.1355, up 0.0029 or 0.26% on the session. With the slight gains, the euro closed higher against the dollar for a fourth consecutive session and for the seventh time over the last 10 trading days. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up by more than 1.5% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
In overnight trading, the BOJ rattled global foreign exchange markets with a shocking decision to hold its deposit rate at its current rate of Negative 0.1%. Many analysts expected the Japanese Central Bank to approve a wide set of easing measures to bolster flagging economic growth. Despite leaving rates unchanged for the time being, BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda emphasized that the bank will do ""whatever it takes,"" in future meetings to help achieve its 2% inflation objective over the next two years. 
Although the BOJ maintained its money market operations at its current increases of 80 trillion yen per year, Kuroda indicated that the central bank could remain open to raising the total in subsequent meetings. 
The BOJ reiterated that it will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japanese real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) at an annual increasing rate of roughly 3.3 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. In addition, the Japanese Central Bank said it will continue to purchase corporate bonds at its current level of 3.2 trillion yen. 
As a result, the yen surged more than 3% against the dollar to an intraday high of ¥107.88, enjoying its strongest one-day move in seven years. 
It came one day after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) completed its third meeting of 2016 by leaving its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a target range between 0.25 and 0.50%. In December, the FOMC ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy by hiking the Fed Funds Rate 25 basis points. The move at the end of last year marked the first rate hike by the Fed in nearly a decade.
Before the FOMC meets again in June, the Committee said it will assess economic conditions, measures of labor market conditions, indications of inflationary pressures and expectations, as well as readings on financial and international developments as it determines the size of future adjustments to the Federal Funds Rate. Notably, the FOMC did not rule out a June rate hike in Wednesday's statement.On Thursday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool lowered the probability of a June rate hike to 15.0% from 100% during the previous session. The CME Group now expects a 38.8% chance that the Fed will wait until September before raising rates again, up from 30% on Wednesday.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.55% to an intraday low of 93.66 before settling at 93.73.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan held off from expanding monetary stimulus on Thursday, defying market expectations for action even as soft global demand, an unwelcome rise in the yen and weak consumption threatened to derail a fragile economic recovery.
The yen surged the most against the dollar and the euro in nearly six years as the decision caught investors off guard, while the Nikkei share average sank 3.6 percent. [MKTS/GLOB]
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda left the door open for more stimulus, stressing there were no limits to what monetary policy can do to address strong risks to the outlook.
""There's absolutely no change to our stance of aiming to achieve 2 percent inflation at the earliest date possible, and to do whatever it takes to achieve this,"" Kuroda told a news conference. ""If needed, we can deepen negative rates much more.""
At Thursday's rate review, the BOJ decided to maintain its pledge to increase base money at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($732 billion) via aggressive asset purchases. It also left unchanged a 0.1 percent negative rate it applies to some of the excess reserves that financial institutions park at the BOJ.
""I think the odds of (monetary easing) were half and half, but the most surprising point is that the markets seemed to have been surprised,"" said Masashi Murata, a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
""The most important point is that BOJ, especially Kuroda, would like to save its weapons and power for an emergency.""
In a separate move, the BOJ created a 300 billion yen loan program offering funds at zero interest to banks in areas hit by this month's earthquake in southern Japan.
Kuroda defended the decision to keep policy unchanged, saying that a steady improvement in the economy allows the BOJ to spend some time studying the effect of its past easing steps.
""We took pre-emptive action by adopting negative interest rates in January ... Now is the time to see how the effect of our policies spread to the economy,"" he said.
Kuroda said the positive effects of negative rates would begin to spread to the economy before the end of the year.
""We won't deploy ammunition in small increments ... That doesn't mean that once we take action at a certain meeting, we will hold off on action at the next meeting or leave, say, six months in between policy changes.""
The BOJ next meets for a rate review in mid-June, followed by a more crucial meeting in late July where it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and inflation projections.
""For now, the BOJ is in a wait-and-see mode to judge the effects of its negative rate policy, said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Eventually, I think the BOJ will lower the interest rate further into negative territory later this year, perhaps after the July (upper house) election.""
HELICOPTER MONEY UP NEXT?
The BOJ also cut its inflation forecasts in a quarterly review of its projections on Thursday. And it once again pushed back the timing for hitting its 2 percent price target, by six months, saying it may not happen until March 2018 at the latest.
The decision came in the wake of data that showed consumer prices slipped in March at the fastest pace in three years while household spending fell at the sharpest rate in a year, adding pressure on the BOJ to do more to spur growth.
Household and corporate inflation expectations have weakened despite the BOJ's decision in January to add a 0.1 percent negative rate to its massive asset-buying program.
The BOJ has been in a bind, with many central bankers worried about the gloomy outlook but increasingly reluctant to use their diminishing policy ammunition.
Kuroda tried to counter growing market views that the BOJ is running out of options, saying he saw no trouble with the bank's bond-buying operations.
He also dismissed the idea of ""helicopter money,"" or underwriting government debt so the money can go directly to citizens, saying that it was impossible to adopt it under current Japanese law.
""Having said that, I don't think there are limits to monetary policy.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Emerging Asian currencies bulls stepped back during the last two weeks with bearish sentiment on China's yuan, a Reuters poll showed.
However, positive views on regional currencies remained as the U.S. Federal Reserves on Wednesday indicated it was not in a hurry to raise interest rates although it kept the door open to a June hike. 
The Bank of Japan on Thursday held monetary policy unchanged, spurring investors to dump dollar holdings against the yen and other Asian currencies.
Sentiment on the yuan turned bearish, according to the survey of 19 fund managers, currency traders and analysts conducted from Tuesday through Thursday.
That turnaround came as Chinese companies have rushed to buy dollars for overseas investments, with a slowing economy hurting local investments. [CNY/] The renminbi's views had been bullish since late March on some signs of stabilization in the world's second-largest economy.
The Malaysian ringgit's bullish bets shrank to the lowest since mid-March, the poll found.
On Tuesday, the ringgit fell to its weakest in more than a week as state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) said some of its bonds were in default after missed payments.
Views on the Philippine peso turned bearish with its short positions hitting their largest since mid-February.
Foreign investors were net sellers of Manila stocks in the last three straight weeks amid fears that whoever wins the May 9 election could find it difficult to generate the economic momentum built up during President Benigno Aquino's six-year single term.
Bullish bets on the Singapore dollar continued to decline after the central bank unexpectedly eased its exchange-rate based monetary policy. The city-state's exports in March tumbled with sales to China, the United States and Europe down. 
South Korea's won saw long positions halving in the last two weeks with caution growing over possible intervention by the foreign exchange authorities to stem its strength amid a slowdown in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
The won last week hit a 5-1/2-month peak on stock inflows and some speculation that the authorities may allow more appreciation ahead of a U.S. Treasury report on currency practice of major trading partners.
Optimism on the Taiwan dollar and the Thai baht almost evaporated.
Taiwan's economy likely shrank in the first three months of the year, a Reuters poll showed, which would mark the third quarter in a row that the economy has contracted on a year-on-year basis.
Sentiment on the baht deteriorated as the central bank said it is ready to act if the currency's moves affect the economy.
By contrast, the Indian rupee's bullish bets hit the largest since mid-April 2015 as local financial markets were set to see net offshore fund inflows for a second consecutive month.
Optimism over reform momentum, after an investor-friendly budget from the federal government and a modest current account gap spurred purchases from foreign investors. 
India's economy grew at a robust annual 7.3 percent in the October-December quarter, aiding gains.
The poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen surged almost 3 percent against the euro and dollar on Thursday after the Bank of Japan opted out of any further moves to ease policy, in stark contrast to a handful of media reports which had driven the yen lower in the past week. 
It was the yen’s biggest daily gain in almost a year against the dollar <JPY=> and its largest in 5 years against the euro (EURJPY=) after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was not thinking about applying negative rates to lending to financial institutions.
Adding to the mix was the lack of a strong sign from the U.S. Federal Reserve on the chances of another rise in its rates in June, weakening the dollar 0.7 percent against a basket of currencies and 0.3 percent against the euro. <EUR=>
""With today’s policy announcement, the Bank of Japan has essentially excited to disappoint and as a result we’ve seen the yen moving dramatically stronger in immediate reaction,"" said Nick Gartside, Chief Investment Officer for Fixed Income at JP Morgan Asset Management.
By 0715 GMT, the dollar had fallen 2.9 percent to 108.17 yen and the euro 2.7 percent to 122.90 yen. 
The BOJ held off from expanding monetary stimulus even as global headwinds, a strong yen and soft consumption threatened to derail Japan's fragile economic recovery.
Officials have used language in recent weeks that in the past has prefaced intervention to weaken the yen but most major banks have come to the conclusion that Tokyo will not do so until the currency gets closer to 100 per dollar. 
Japanese analysts are not convinced the currency can continue to gain. 
""It was inevitable that the yen regained all the losses made on easing expectations. Sure, the market was disappointed, but that does not mean the yen will keep gaining,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
After a two-day policy meeting that ended Wednesday, the Fed said global economic headwinds - widely seen as the main reason it has not pushed rates higher - remained on its radar while stopping short of mentioning the risks these posed.
Analysts said it had offered little hope of a hike in rates in June.
""The FOMC statement did nothing to help the dollar at all,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes. ""(There is) no reason to look for more than one more rate hike this year."" 
New Zealand's central bank also skipped a chance to cut its interest rates on Thursday, triggering a short squeeze that saw the kiwi dollar gain a full U.S. cent.

The kiwi soared 2.3 percent to $0.6974 <NZD=D4>, from around $0.6850, after the RBNZ kept the cash rate steady at 2.25 percent.

The BoJ kept the deposit rate at minus 0.1% and its asset purchases at ¥80 trillion per year. It also pushed back the expected data for reaching its 2% inflation target.
The decision came on the heels of data showing that consumer prices fell in March at the fastest pace in three years and household spending falling at the fastest rate in a year.
Ahead of the meeting expectations had been building for more monetary stimulus measures.
The BoJ shocked markets with its decision to adopt negative interest rates in January, but the continued strength of the yen has kept up pressure on the central bank to do more to spur price growth.
Overnight, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and indicated that data on jobs and inflation will determine whether it raises interest rates in June.
The dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.3% to 1.1357.
The dollar was also sharply lower against the New Zealand dollar, with NZD/USD jumping 1.23% to 0.6969.

Japan also reported provisional industrial production for March month-on-month rose 3.6%, more than the 2.9% gain seen, while retail sales slipped 1.1% year-on-year, less than the 1.5% declined expected.
The Federal Reserve's policy making Federal Open Market Committee left short-term interest rates unchanged Wednesday as expected, but tweaked its policy statement, possibly preparing financial markets for another modest rate hike in coming months.

The statement, according to Capital Economics, sets the tone ahead.
""We don’t believe that the slightly more positive tone of the policy statement released after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) left interest rates on hold at 2.25% today will prevent the Bank from cutting rates to 2.0% at the meeting in June,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients.

429,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2016 06:05PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ticks up, as Fed holds rates steady for third straight meeting","Investing.com -- EUR/USD posted modest gains, extending a rally from the previous two sessions, exhibiting little movement on Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for a third consecutive meeting.
The currency pair traded between 1.1273 and 1.1361, before settling at 1.1326, up 0.24% on the session. With the gains, the euro closed above 1.13 for the first time in six sessions. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up by roughly 1.4% against its American counterpart. More broadly, the euro has rallied approximately 4.25% against the dollar over the first four months of the year. 
In a relatively neutral April monetary policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by lifting the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points. It represented the first rate hike by the Fed in nearly a decade.
Moving forward, the FOMC said it will assess economic conditions, measures of labor market conditions, indications of inflationary pressures and expectations, as well as readings on financial and international developments as it determines the size of future adjustments to the Federal Funds Rate. Since the FOMC last met in March, the central bank noted that economic activity has slowed in recent weeks. In addition, the FOMC said while the housing sector has shown improvement since the start of the year, business fixed investment and net exports remain soft.
""The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run,"" the FOMC said in the policy statement. ""However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.""
While the Fed has expressed optimism with continued improvements in the labor market, the U.S. central bank has remained concerned with sluggishly low inflation in recent months. As oil prices hover near multi-year lows and the dollar remains markedly above its 2014 levels, long-term inflation has fallen under the Fed's 2% objective in every month over the last three years. At the start of the year, however, there have been some signals that inflation is beginning to firm. In January, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index nearly doubled to 1.3%, hitting its highest level since the fall of 2014. The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, soared to 1.7%, its strongest annual gain since the end of 2012. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, increased by 1.7% in both January and February. Further increases in inflation could compel the FOMC to lift interest rates in June.
Elsewhere, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday morning that its pending home sales index rose 1.4% in March, above consensus estimates for a 0.5% increase. In the Northeast region, pending home sales are up 18.4% on a yearly basis, offsetting slowing growth in the Midwest. It came one month after the index surged 3.5% in February. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta also increased its forecast for U.S. GDP in the first quarter by 0.2 to 0.6%, ahead of Thursday's latest estimate by the Department of Commerce. Analysts are expecting a reading of 0.7%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, wavered throughout a volatile session before settling at 94.38, down 0.07%. The index remains near eight-month lows.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell seven basis points to 1.85%, halting an eight-day winning streak."

436,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2016 02:21AM ET</span>","Dollar languishes ahead of Fed, BOJ meetings","By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar remained subdued on Wednesday after a broad retreat overnight ahead of policy decisions by both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan, while the Australian dollar tumbled after data showed core inflation unexpectedly slowed to the lowest on record. 
The Fed is considered certain to keep rates steady when its policy meeting ends later in the global day, so the focus rests on the tone of its statement and any clues it offers as to when interest rates will rise.
Traders said policymakers may be wary of sending too strong a message of an imminent policy tightening, particularly after another batch of disappointing data.
""I think the Federal Reserve is getting nervous about tightening,"" Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Advisory Partners, part of investment and advisory firm Blackstone Group LP, told reporters at a roundtable event on a visit to Tokyo.
""They tightened in December, and said they would tighten four times in 2016. They passed on a March increase, and I think they'll only raise interest rates once, probably in June,"" he said. 
Any hints that an interest rate hike might be delayed would leave the dollar vulnerable to more weakness against the euro and yen. While dollar bulls fear the Fed will sound dovish again, a rise in U.S. Treasury yields to five-week highs suggested some investors expected a more hawkish tone. 
Hours after the Fed, the BOJ will step up to the plate on Thursday in Asia. 
Many market players expect the BOJ to take some form of easing measures, including an increase in purchase of stocks and a cut in interest rates, though many say this meeting will be a close call.
The greenback edged down about 0.2 percent to 111.08 yen  though it remained above its overnight low of 110.67.
Against the yen, the common currency scaled a three-week peak of 125.98 (EURJPY=R) overnight but was last down about 0.2 percent at 125.57.
The euro edged down about 0.1 percent to $1.1297 , but remained above a nearly four-week trough of $1.1216 set on Monday.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major rivals, edged down 0.1 percent to 94.504 (DXY).
Sterling, which climbed to a near three-month high of $1.4640  on Tuesday, last stood at $1.4570.
The Australian dollar, meanwhile, skidded 1.5 percent to $0.7632 , plumbing $0.7623 earlier, after data showed Australia's consumer prices unexpectedly fell 0.2 percent in January-March, undershooting median forecast of a 0.3 percent rise, while core inflation was slower than expected. 
It was the first time since 2009 the inflation gauge fell to a negative level, raising speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia may have to consider rate cuts.
""The underlying rate of inflation has slowed considerably and Australia's CPI rates are finally starting to look more like its developed market peers. This won't sway the RBA to lower the cash rate next Tuesday, but it will keep their easing bias in play for a while,"" said Jasmin Argyrou, Aberdeen Asset Management senior investment manager in Sydney.
The Aussie had risen almost 15 percent earlier this month from its near seven-year low touched in January, thanks to recovery in commodity prices, but rising expectations of a rate cut could halt the rally.
""The RBA has been nervous about a strength in the Australian dollar. So a rate cut would be a natural option. The Aussie's rally could reverse its course,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, forex strategist at Daiwa Securities. 

""On the other hand, iron ore prices have surged this year, so given their correlation, that should prevent the Aussie from falling fast,"" he added.

The currency pair traded between 1.1256 and 1.1339, before settling at 1.1298, up 0.0032 or 0.28% on the session. Following a brief four-day losing streak last week, the euro has closed higher against the dollar in each of the last two trading days. Despite the slight gains, the euro has still closed below 1.13 against the dollar in the last six sessions. Nevertheless, the euro is still up against its American counterpart by 1% over the last month, amid dovish indications from the Fed of a delayed interest rate hike.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Investors continue to await Wednesday's interest rate decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), its third monetary policy statement release since their historic rate hike in December. The Fed has responded by holding its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first two meetings this year. Last month, the FOMC voted 9-1 to leave the Fed Funds Rate unchanged, with Kansas City Fed president Esther George serving as the lone dissenter.
On Tuesday, investors largely shrugged off a survey from CNBC, which showed that 48 top economists, strategists and fund managers expect the Fed to delay the timing of its next rate hike from June to August. In March, the FOMC downgraded its expectation for 2016 rate hikes from four to two, amid continual headwinds from global financial markets. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.
The Fed's decision will be followed by a closely-watched meeting from the Bank of Japan on Thursday. USD/JPY lost 0.20% on Tuesday to settle at 111.20. At the meeting, the BOJ could introduced further easing measures to stave off threats of deflation.
Elsewhere, the latest projections from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast model showed that the U.S. economy is growing at a rate of 0.4% over the first quarter. The projections were recalibrated following the release of home data and durable goods order. The upward revision represents a 0.1% gain from the Atlanta Fed's previous estimate on April 19. In March, new durable goods order in the U.S. increased by 0.8% on a monthly basis, sharply below consensus estimates of a 1.6% gain. A considerable increase in defense goods helped offset losses among commercial aircrafts, which continued to weigh. The modest gains in durable goods orders last month came one month after new orders tumbled by a downwardly revised 3.1% decline in February.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, lost more than 0.40% to an intraday low of 94.17, before settling at 94.45 . The index remains near eight-month lows.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2016 07:00AM ET</span>","Yen gains versus dollar as BOJ, Fed meetings near","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen rose on Tuesday, moving away from lows of several weeks against the dollar and euro as prospects of further monetary stimulus this week from the Bank of Japan remained unclear.
With policy decisions from the Federal Reserve and the BOJ due within hours of each other, many investors are likely to stay on the sidelines. The Fed, which is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, will announce its decision on Wednesday while the BOJ concludes its two-day meeting on Thursday.
Speculation of further easing by the BOJ sent the yen lower last week, but it staged a recovery on Tuesday. The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 110.85 yen , retreating from a three-week high of 111.90 hit the previous day. The euro fetched 125 yen (EURJPY=R), down 0.2 percent and off Monday's three-week peak of 125.525.
The yen lost 2.1 percent in value against the dollar on Friday - its biggest one-day fall since BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced a second round of monetary easing in October 2014. The trigger was a Bloomberg report that said the BOJ was considering applying negative rates to its lending program for financial institutions.
A policy decision will be a close call.
""The yen lost a lot of ground on Friday, so there is some speculative unwinding of positions ahead of the BOJ meeting,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura.
""With dollar/yen above 110 yen and the Japanese stock market stabilizing, there is a chance that the BOJ may hold back and disappoint those anticipating aggressive easing.""
The BOJ introduced negative rates earlier this year, charging commercial banks 0.1 percent interest on a small portion of their reserves. It has run a quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE) program since April 2013.
These measures have so far failed to generate the inflationary pressures needed to reach the central bank's 2 percent inflation target by the first half of fiscal 2017, fuelling expectations that the BOJ may ease again.
""We believe extra QQE is priced to some extent,"" said Daiju Aoki, Japan economist at UBS. ""Inaction at the April meeting without strong assurances of further easing could be interpreted by the market as a confirmation that the BOJ has de-prioritized the exchange rate ahead of the G7 summit in May.""
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe chairs the G7 meeting and Japan wants to avoid criticism that it is waging a global currency devaluation war by resorting to additional stimulus.

Meanwhile, sterling rose to 10-week highs as prospects of Britain leaving the EU ebbed. The pound rose to $1.4579 , while the euro edged down 0.5 percent to 77.44 pence (EURGBP=). [GBP/]

449,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 25, 2016 05:46PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ends four-day skid, ahead of start of FOMC April meeting","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose modestly on Monday, halting a four-day losing streak, as currency traders continued to await the start of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day April meeting.
The currency pair traded between 1.1263 and 1.1274 before settling at 1.1267, up 0.0036 or 0.31% on the session. Over the last month, the euro is relatively flat against the dollar, up by approximately 0.85%. More broadly, the euro has surged roughly 3% versus its American counterpart since the start of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
There was little movement on global foreign exchange markets on the session, ahead of Wednesday's interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve, its third since a historic rate hike in December. In each of its first two meetings in 2016, the Fed has held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%. In March, the FOMC voted 9-1 to leave the Fed Funds Rate unchanged, with Kansas City Fed president Esther George serving as the lone dissenter.
While the FOMC is not expected to lift short-term rates at this week's meeting, the Fed could provide hints on the timing of further tightening of its monetary policy cycle. The dollar has fluctuated in recent weeks following extremely dovish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen on the likelihood that the central bank will remain cautious on future rate hikes, amid strong headwinds from global financial markets.
Many economists believe that it is more likely that the FOMC could raise interest rates at its next meeting in June. On Monday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the probability of a June rate hike at 22.5%, up from 15.8% one month earlier. At the same time, the CME Group says there is only a 2.3% chance for a rate hike by the Fed this week, still above last month's probability of 1.2%.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, new home sales in the U.S. increased by 511,000 in March, building off robust upwardly revised gains of 519,000 from the previous month. Analysts expected to see gains of 522,000 on the month. The losses were concentrated in the Western region, where sales plunged by 23.6%.
Meanwhile, Germany's Ifo Institute said Monday that its Business Climate Index in April fell slightly by 0.1 to 106.6, below analysts' forecasts for a reading of 107.0. It came in the wake of comments from the Bundesbank last week on slowing momentum in economic growth over the second quarter.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, lost more than 0.45% to an intraday low of 94.65, before closing slightly higher at 94.74. With the considerable losses, the index retreated back near eight-month lows.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained two basis points to 1.91%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year added three basis points to 0.26%. Government bond yields on 10-year German bunds are up nearly a dozen basis points over the last year."

453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2016 08:04AM ET</span>","Yen recovers, data shows outright swing against dollar","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen recovered from a walloping at the end of last week on Monday, with investors focusing on a meeting of the Bank of Japan that many expect to deliver further easing of monetary policy in a bid to halt the currency’s rise. 
Bets on the yen to strengthen further reached a record high in the week to last Tuesday, while positioning on the dollar turned to betting on outright falls for the first time in a year. [IMM/FX]
That largely reflects market scepticism that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which also meets on Wednesday, will push on any time soon with rises in interest rates that the rest of the world economy still looks too shaky to deal with. 
""Such has been the aggressive move by real money investors to sell the dollar since the start of this year, it just says there is no real faith in what the Fed are trying to do,"" said Neil Mellor, a strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London. 
""It's tempting to see this as a modest correction to the big move higher we saw last year. But if the dollar is going to rise again, they will have to rebuild belief on markets that they can deliver these higher rates without, say, a blowout in China."" 
The dollar index traded 0.3 percent lower on the day at 94.863. Against the euro, it dipped to $1.1255, at the weaker end of a 10-cent range it has held for a year. 
It fell half a percent to 111.20 yen per dollar. 
A number of GDP reports accompany the central bank meetings later this week and strategists say markets may be cautious in the meantime. 
TURNING TIDE?
While the positioning numbers give some sense of the negative sentiment around the dollar, when bets on currencies reach long-term highs it often means there is little room for investors to bet further against them. 
Even with a retreat in expectations for action from the Fed, market interest rates continue to give investment managers far higher returns for holding the dollar than the euro or yen. 
""After a pretty tough three months for the dollar, we think the tide is turning, especially when we consider some of the structural problems affecting other countries,"" said Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG Wealth Management. 
""We will look to add bullish dollar positions in our portfolios if market signals confirm that the dollar is indeed turning higher.""
The yen lost 2.1 percent in value on Friday - its biggest fall since BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced a second round of monetary easing in October 2014. The trigger was a Bloomberg report that the Bank of Japan is considering applying negative rates to its lending program for financial institutions.
Expectations of more easing have grown but traders are also aware that further BOJ moves may have limited impact in weakening the yen, as did the introduction of negative interest rates in January.
""We are not yet convinced that the yen will continue to weaken in the near-term,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. 

""Our analysts in Tokyo remain unconvinced that the BoJ will ease policy this week. The sharp weakening on Friday could also contribute to easing concern amongst BoJ policymakers over excessive yen strength.""

The currency pair traded between 1.1218 and 1.1309, before settling at 1.1227, down 0.0063 or 0.56% on the session. The euro fell against the dollar for the third straight trading day, closing below 1.13 for the fifth time in the last seven sessions. With the sharp losses, the euro fell to the lowest level versus the dollar since March 29. The dollar closed higher against the euro for the second straight week.
Despite the recent downturn, the euro is still up against its American counterpart by more than 3.3% since the start of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Investors continued to react to dovish comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on Thursday regarding the likelihood of future easing measures from the central bank. It came after the ECB's Governing Council left its benchmark interest rate for the euro zone at a record-low of zero and its deposit rate unchanged at Minus-0.4%. More critically, Draghi noted that the ECB could continue to hold interest rates at comparative low levels beyond the expiration of a comprehensive EUR 80 billion a month Quantitative Easing program in March, 2017.
The decision came days before the start of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) two-day meeting on April 26-27. At the meeting, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%. The Fed has left short-term interest rates unchanged in each of its first two meetings this year.
This week, the majority of respondents in a poll taken by Reuters expect the Fed to hold rates firm at the meeting before approving a rate hike in June. Of 80 economists polled in the survey, more than two-thirds agreed that the FOMC will lift the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points in June to 0.50-0.75%. Another 20% believe the FOMC will implement its first rate hike of the year in September.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose to a three week high against the yen on Friday, on a report of likely further monetary policy easing from the Bank of Japan, while a rise in crude oil prices was offset by poor technology sector earnings, leaving Wall Street stocks steady.
The dollar rose more than 2.0 percent against the yen to 111.80 yen, its highest level since April 1 after a media report said the BOJ is considering expanding its negative rate policy to bank loans and could cut rates further.

Oil prices rose and notched their third straight week of gains amid upbeat sentiment over the supply glut. Strong U.S. gasoline consumption and increasing signs of declining production around the world have underpinned the sector recently, traders said. 
Brent crude ended up 1.3 percent at $45.11 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) settled up 1.3 percent at $43.73.

Yields have fallen since the beginning of the year on concerns about weakening U.S. economic growth and on rising volatility in the oil and stock markets, which has led investors to lower estimates that further rate hikes are near.
""It's looking more and more to me that we might see an increase in June,"" said Jim Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Fund Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.

Benchmark 10-year notes fell 5/32 in price to yield 1.89 percent, up from 1.87 percent on Thursday.

The value of the dollar's position fell to -$1.85 billion in the week ended April 19, from $0.4 billion the previous week, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
It was the first time since May 6 that investors have been short the dollar on a net basis.

The dollar rose 2 percent against the yen on Friday, hitting a three-week high against the Japanese currency, after a report the Bank of Japan was considering expanding its negative rate policy to bank loans and could cut rates further.
For the week, the dollar was set to rise 2.6 percent against the yen, which would mark its strongest weekly gain against the Japanese currency since late October 2014.
The dollar hit a 17-month low against the yen of 107.61 yen on April 11. Analysts partly attributed the yen's rise to bets that the Bank of Japan would not intervene to stop the yen's recent rally.
A weaker currency is desireable because Japan's economy relies heavily on exports and a weaker currency makes Japanese products less expensive to foreign buyers.
Euro net short contracts fell to 46,917, their lowest in eight weeks.
The dollar rose this week against a basket of six major world currencies, its second weekly gain in a row after falling five of the past six weeks.
The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2016 07:00PM ET</span>",Cuba to cut prices on some consumer goods at hard currency stores: workers,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba on Friday will lower the price of some basic household goods at thousands of state-run hard currency stores, employees of two retail outlets in Havana said on Thursday.
The move appears aimed at quieting grumbling among Cubans who have not benefited from market-oriented reforms and are upset over rising food prices and inequality.
According to a document described as a leaked Ministry of Finances and Prices list that circulated on the internet, the goods include such items as cooking oil, chicken, hamburger meat and soup, and price cuts vary from 10 percent to 30 percent. The government did not immediately confirm the information.
An employee at a Havana outlet, who asked not to be identified, would only state they included ""basic products people need such as toothpaste, detergent and cooking oil.""
The measure comes less than a week after President Raul Castro, speaking to a Communist Party Congress, admitted market-oriented reforms begun five years ago have yet to trickle down to many residents who remained hard pressed to make ends meet.
In communist-run Cuba, the state has a monopoly on imports and the sale of imported goods, which are sold at the hard currency stores.
The Congress was held largely in secret and produced no announcement of new economic measures, frustrating residents who complain the reforms are moving too slowly.
Miriam Rodriguez, a cashier at a Havana supermarket, confirmed rumors circulating in Havana since Wednesday.
""We have to work late today to organize all the new prices of basic goods for tomorrow,"" she said.
Ariadna, another store employee, said, ""There is a directive that has come down to the stores announcing the reduction in prices."" 
The retail outlets sprang up after the fall of former benefactor the Soviet Union led Cuba to allow the dollar to circulate freely alongside the peso.
They have a mark-up of a minimum of 240 percent, ostensibly a tax to help those who cannot afford what are called the ""dollar stores"".
In 2004 the dollar was replaced by a local equivalent called the convertible peso (CUC).
The CUC is pegged to the dollar, while the peso is valued at $0.04, angering a population which is paid in the latter at an average equivalent of 25 CUC per month but often has to make essential purchases in the hard currency stores.

The government pledged in 2013 to eliminate the CUC, but at this week’s congress admitted it had only taken the first steps toward that goal.

The currency pair traded between 1.12711 and 1.1399, before settling at 1.1298, up 0.0060 or 0.54% on the session. With the slight losses, the euro closed below 1.13 against the dollar for a second consecutive session. Despite a recent downturn, the euro is still up against its American counterpart by roughly 1% since Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the U.S. central bank will remain cautious with future interest rate hikes at a closely-watched speech last month.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Thursday afternoon, the ECB's Governing Council left its benchmark interest rate for the euro zone at a record-low of zero in a closely-watched decision in Frankfurt. At the same time, the ECB's deposit rate remained unchanged at Minus-0.4%, while its marginal lending facility rate also stayed unchanged at 0.25%. In March, the ECB lowered the deposit rate, or the rate it charges on overnight, commercial bank deposits parked at the central bank, to its lowest level on record. The marginal lending rate is the rate at which banks pay to borrow money stored at the ECB.
The Governing Council also opted to leave the scope and duration of its comprehensive quantitative easing program unchanged at €80 billion per month. In December, the ECB extended the asset-purchasing program through March, 2017, ""or beyond.""
At a press conference following Thursday's policy statement release, ECB president Mario Draghi sent strong indications that further rate cuts could be forthcoming.
""We continue to expect them (interest rates) to remain at present, or lower, levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of asset purchases,"" Draghi said.
Draghi also spent a portion of his press conference defending the ECB's independence against Germany and other critics of its monetary policy. Inflation in the euro zone was flat in March on a year-over-year basis, above estimates for a 0.1% decline.
""We have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the euro zone not only for Germany,"" Draghi said. ""We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.""
The ECB's dovish stance could prompt the Federal Reserve to follow suit when it faces a similar interest rate decision next week. A subsequent rate cut by the ECB could also allow the Fed to implicitly tighten monetary policy while leaving short-term interest rates unchanged. Since approving a historic interest rate hike in December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first two meetings this year.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rallied sharply to an intraday high of 94.68 in U.S. afternoon trading before settling at 94.62. Despite the rebound, the index still remains near eight-month lows.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2016 08:07AM ET</span>","Euro climbs, focus on policy signals from Draghi","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose to the day's high against the dollar on Thursday after the European Central Bank held interest rates unchanged at record lows, as expected, with the focus now turning to President Mario Draghi's press conference.
Draghi is likely to drive home the case for ultra-loose monetary policy, but any hint that current policy settings are appropriate for the time being could see the euro rise towards $1.15, a level seen last in October last year.
""It will be interesting to see whether Draghi reverts back to old tricks and tries to talk down the euro in the absence of being able to actually use policy tools in order to drive it lower,"" said Craig Erlam, senior analyst at OANDA, a currency broker.
Last month, while the ECB delivered aggressive easing measures, the euro rallied after Draghi said there was probably no need for more rate cuts if the latest stimulus worked. Since then, inflation expectations, based on the five-year, five-year forward rate, have eased a bit, keeping investors on the alert for any dovish tone from Draghi.
That is despite sharp criticism by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who said that negative interest rates were hurting small German savers and fuelling the rise of the eurosceptic AfD party.
At Thursday's meeting, the ECB kept its rate on bank overnight deposits, generally seen as its primary interest rate tool, at -0.40 percent.
The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.1335 , not far from Wednesday's peak of $1.1388, and has gained 4.6 percent since the last ECB meeting on March 10 when the ECB eased policy. Against the yen, it edged higher to 124.25 yen. (EURJPY=).
Lutz Karpowitz, strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said investors will focus on what Draghi has to say about future easing.
""Should he be any more outspoken on the matter than last time round, euro/dollar is likely to ease further. I would certainly steer clear of long positions,"" Karpowitz added. 
Still, with three major central bank meetings looming, traders cited a lack of market conviction on direction bets. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its policy review on April 26-27, while the Bank of Japan will meet on April 28.
BOJ officials are growing more receptive to stepping up monetary easing measures by buying more ETFs invested in shares, as weak global growth threatens Japan's fragile economic recovery, sources have told Reuters.
While no action is expected from the Fed, traders will be looking for clues in its policy statement that the central bank is preparing markets for a June interest rate hike. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has repeatedly said the Fed will be cautious in tightening policy, prompting markets to barely price in a hike this year. 

U.S. Treasury yields have fallen as a result, though they hit three-week highs on Wednesday as oil and stocks gained, which helped the dollar. [US/]

483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2016 07:11PM ET</span>",Harriet Tubman to be first African-American on U.S. currency,"By Megan Cassella
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anti-slavery crusader Harriet Tubman will become the first African-American on the face of U.S. paper currency, and the first woman in more than a century, when she replaces former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill.
The U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday that Tubman, who was born into slavery in the early 1820s and went on to help hundreds of slaves escape, would take the center spot on the bill, while Jackson, a slave owner, would move to the back.
Introduced alongside a slew of changes to the $5 and $10 notes as well, the redesign gives the Treasury ""a chance to open the aperture to reflect more of America's history,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.
A new $10 bill will add images of five female leaders of the women's suffrage movement, including Sojourner Truth and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, to the back, while keeping founding father Alexander Hamilton on the front.
The reverse of a new $5 note will show former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., officials said. Former President Abraham Lincoln will remain on the front.
Lew said the designs should be unveiled by 2020 and go into circulation ""as quickly as possible,"" although he declined to say when. He said the $10 bill was scheduled to go out first, citing security needs.
The long-awaited decision to replace the seventh president of the United States with Tubman followed months of outreach by the Treasury regarding which woman should be featured on a bill. 
The debate began when the Treasury announced plans in June to feature a woman on the $10 note, prompted partly by a young girl's letter to President Barack Obama that criticized the lack of women on U.S. currency and a social media campaign last year called ""Women on 20s.""
A MUSICAL
Hamilton’s growing celebrity status, due largely to a Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway musical about his life, “Hamilton,” created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, propelled an effort to keep the first U.S. Treasury secretary on the $10 note and to replace Jackson on the $20 bill instead.
Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812's Battle of New Orleans, was president from 1829-1837. But he has been criticized for his treatment of American Indians and ownership of slaves.
After considering hundreds of candidates, Lew said Tubman was chosen for her leadership and work helping others.
""It's the essential story of American democracy about how one person who grew up in slavery, never had the benefit of learning how to read or write, could change the course of history,"" he said.
Tubman grew up working on a Maryland plantation and escaped in her late 20s. She returned to the South to help hundreds of black slaves to freedom and worked as a Union spy during the Civil War. She died in 1913.
Women have not been depicted on U.S. bills since Martha Washington, who was on the $1 silver certificate from 1891 to 1896, and Pocahontas, who was in a group picture on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869.
On coins, Sacagawea, a Native American who assisted the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is featured on the gold dollar, and suffragist Susan B. Anthony is on the silver dollar. Deaf-blind author and activist Helen Keller is on the back of the Alabama quarter.
Tubman became the top-trending hashtag on Twitter shortly after the news broke on Wednesday, with more than 100,000 tweets and mentions online. 
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who is campaigning to become the first female U.S. president, praised Tubman as ""a woman, a leader, and a freedom fighter"" on Twitter and said she could not think of a better choice.
Some Twitter users applauded Treasury’s decision to keep Hamilton on the $10 bill.

Actress Mara Wilson (@MaraWritesStuff) tweeted at Miranda, the ""Hamilton"" creator, saying: “@Lin_Manuel First you win a Pulitzer, now you're affecting US currency. Get some rest!""

The currency pair traded between 1.1291 and 1.1387, before settling at 1.1298, down 0.0060 or 0.54% on the session. With the sharp losses, the euro closed below 1.13 against the dollar for the first time in three sessions.

EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The greenback moved in lockstep with soaring oil prices on Wednesday, rising considerably in U.S. afternoon trading. U.S. crude futures pared earlier losses from Wednesday morning, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. commercial crude oil inventories increased by 2.1 million barrels for the week ending on April 15. As a result, WTI crude surged more than 3% to eclipse $44 a barrel.
It came one day after the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 3.1 million barrels last week. Analysts expected the Energy Department to report a build of 2.4 million barrels. At the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma, stockpiles fell by 248,000 barrels, defying expectations for a draw around 1 million barrels. Inventory levels at Cushing, the main delivery point for NYMEX oil, still remain close to full storage capacity.
At session-highs, both WTI and Brent crude futures reached their highest level since November.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 94.56, before settling near session-highs at 94.54. The index is still down more than 2% over the last two months.
Investors await Thursday's interest rate decision by the European Central Bank's Governing Council for further indications on the scope of the ECB's controversial Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP). The ECB is widely expected to hold rates steady, one month after implementing a plethora of easing measures. It is also unlikely that the Governing Council will begin offering ""helicopter money,"" or cash payments to individual investors in its latest effort to bolster economic growth.
The ECB's latest monetary policy decision also comes ahead of next week's Federal Open Market Committee two-day April meeting. The FOMC is also expected to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%. In the weeks following the FOMC's last meeting in late-March, several hawkish members have appeared to have broken ranks with Fed chair Janet Yellen on the prospect of further rate hikes. A slew of policymakers including Kansas City Fed president Esther George, San Francisco Fed president John Williams and Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren  have openly disagreed with the Fed chair, who has remained adamant that the Fed should proceed cautiously with further tightening.
Though the FOMC estimated in December that it could raise short-term rates as much as four times this year, the Fed lowered the projections last month amid weak global economic and financial conditions.

A TNS opinion poll published on Wednesday showed support for staying in the EU was rising and offered support to the pound.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit 10-month lows against some commodity currencies on Tuesday on a growing appetite for risky assets and lost further ground to the euro after weak U.S. economic data reinforced views that Federal Reserve monetary policy would remain dovish.
The Australian dollar  hit $0.7827, its highest level against the dollar since last June, while the New Zealand dollar  touched $0.7055, also its highest since last June, on the back of oil price gains. The Canadian dollar hit its highest level since last July.
Analysts said a strike by oil workers in Kuwait, which continued for a third day and nearly halved production from the OPEC member, boosted crude prices and commodity currencies. Concerns over China's economic growth have also diminished, while the likelihood of a rapid string of Fed interest rate hikes this year has receded, they said. 
The dollar gained against the safe-haven yen for a second straight day, however, as investors moved into riskier currencies. The dollar was last up 0.28 percent against the yen at 109.11 yen . 
""People are getting a little bit more comfortable with prospects for growth,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Limited in New York.
Analysts noted that recent strength in Chinese economic data, particularly in manufacturing readings, have eased worries about the world's second-largest economy. 
U.S. housing starts data supported expectations that the pace of Fed rate hikes would be slow, in turn hurting the dollar against the euro, analysts said. 
Groundbreaking decreased 8.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.09 million units in March, the lowest level since October, the Commerce Department reported. 
""It supports a more gradual path for Federal Reserve tightening,"" said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York in reference to the U.S. housing data. 
Fed funds futures contracts on Tuesday suggested traders saw only an 18 percent probability of another Fed rate hike in June, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
Expectations that the European Central Bank would not announce further rate cuts in a meeting on Thursday also boosted the euro against the dollar, Viloria of Wells Fargo Securities said.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2016 07:10PM ET</span>","Weaker dollar, tougher policy help China beat back yuan bears","By Pete Sweeney and Jennifer Ablan
SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China's central bank has driven off foreign yuan bears with a combination of intervention, regulation and more than a little help from a shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve's stance, capping risky outflows and buying time to stimulate a wobbly economy.
After a surprise devaluation in August, which came in the midst of a stock market crash and sparked a panic, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) forceful stabilization of the yuan this year has intimidated the short sellers and curbed outflows.
The numbers show the PBOC can claim victory for now over capital flight after a six-month tussle, helping produce a string of improved economic indicators in the first quarter and easing the pressure for aggressive policy support.
But the strong-arm tactics have sapped a lot of energy out of domestic and offshore yuan markets, and it's unclear how sustainable the strategy will be if the dollar is rising.
""We have seen a capitulation,"" said Sugandh Mittal, partner at London-based hedge fund North Asset Management.
While North Asset Management has taken positions on both sides of the yuan trade in recent years, Mittal said it had now turned to a strategy betting on Chinese interest rates.
The offshore and onshore yuan rates, which had consistently priced in deep discounts to the central bank's official guidance rate, have harmonized with the PBOC fix since mid-February and are trading around 6.5 per dollar.
The onshore yuan lost around 4.7 percent against the dollar in 2015. The offshore market, not bound by the official guidance rate, lost over 5.5 percent, then plunged another 2.8 percent in January before regulators moved to reel in the market.
Shorting pressure on the yuan, reflected in the offshore CNH options market through one-month risk reversals, has evaporated since February, and some hedge fund investors told Reuters they were backing off from their depreciation bets.
Investors who predicted sharp declines in the yuan included some high-profile hedge funds, such as Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital Management, who said the PBOC would have to let it lose around 30 percent against the dollar as it printed money to recapitalize banks.
Hayman Capital Management did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
The PBOC spent hundreds of billions of dollars from its $3 trillion-plus currency reserves - the world's largest - to prop up the yuan, and traders think it was also active in the forwards market.
The PBOC did not respond to faxed questions for comment on its overseas operations in swaps and forwards markets.
The PBOC further asserted control by imposing reserve requirements on yuan deposits held offshore by Chinese banks, and threatened to impose a ""Tobin Tax"" on cross-border transactions to discourage speculation.
And analysts say another swing factor was the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to sit pat after its December rate rise.""The Fed could either put out the fire in China by pivoting dovish, or prevent a fire in Japan and Europe by staying hawkish. They chose the former,"" said Stephen Jen, managing partner at SLJ Macro Partners in London.
STILL FIGHTING
Some still think the PBOC will have to give way eventually, it will just take longer than expected.
""We haven't pared down exposure,"" said Adam Rodman, a hedge fund manager at Segra Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.
Segra, which bought options in November, hasn't lost money on the trade and still expects the currency to weaken in the next 18 to 24 months, he said.
""Everybody tries to paint this trade as nefarious. It is silly. China is suffering capital outflows as well as a general credit and financial slowdown, which means downward pressure on its currency.""
Analysts at CLSA forecast the yuan will be floating freely against the dollar by the second half of 2017, resulting in short-term outflows that could knock the exchange rate back to nine yuan per dollar.
""What can't go on forever must come to an end,"" the CLSA team said in a report, predicting capital outflows would lead Beijing to ""step back and allow the renminbi to find its market-determined value.""

""Letting the currency fall quickly will restore financial flows to equilibrium: it is China's financial account that needs fixing, not its current account.""

503,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 18, 2016 05:53PM ET</span>","EUR/USD posts third straight win, as unexpected oil rally sinks dollar","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose modestly on a choppy, volatile day of trading, as investors awaited comments from top central bankers on both continents for further signs of potential divergence before the next round of interest rate decisions later this month.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1274 and 1.1332, before settling at 1.1313, up 0.0014 or 0.13% on the session. With the slight gains, the euro closed higher against the dollar for the third consecutive session and closed above 1.13 for the first time in five trading days. The euro is virtually flat against the dollar over the last month, down 0.05% against its American counterpart since March 18.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The dollar pared earlier gains on Monday after oil unexpectedly staged a dramatic rally in the aftermath of an unproductive meeting among 18 major oil producers over the weekend in Qatar. A summit between major OPEC and Non-OPEC producers, including Russia came to a sudden halt on Sunday afternoon when Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join the group in capping output at January levels. Iranian officials refused to attend the meeting, failing to budge from their stance of ramping up production to four million barrels per day, as the Persian Gulf nation strives to return to pre-sanction levels from 2007. The failure of major producers to achieve any progress in curbing a record glut of oversupply revives industry fears that oil prices will remain persistently low in the near-term future.
Crude futures, however, pared the losses shortly thereafter following reports that Kuwait output hovered around 1 million barrels per day, as producers took roughly 1.5 million barrels offline in response to a strike of thousands of workers over the weekend. While officials from the Kuwait National Petroleum Co. (KNPC) told the Al-Arabiya television network in Dubai that production lingered around 1.1 million bpd on the first day of strike, they expect it to return to average levels before the end of the week. Prior to the strike, Kuwait production remained around 2.8 million bpd, according to Reuters data.
Currency traders await remarks from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on Wednesday in Frankfurt for further hints on potential easing measures that could be implemented by the Governing Council in an effort to stave off deflation throughout the euro zone. Draghi's speech will take place ahead of the ECB's latest interest rate decision on Thursday afternoon. Last month, the Governing Council lowered its deposit rate deeper into negative territory to Minus-0.4%, while expanding its comprehensive asset purchasing program to EUR 80 billion per month.
On Monday evening, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to make an appearance at a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council in Washington. The dollar is up roughly 1% since Yellen sent strong indications in late-March that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will remain cautious with the timing of further interest rate hikes for the remainder of the year. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its first two meetings this year. Although the Fed is not expected to raise short-term interest rates at their two-day meeting next week, the U.S. central bank could approve a 25 basis point hike at a subsequent meeting in June.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six major currencies, lost more than 0.20% to close near session-lows at 94.45. With the losses, the index retreated back to near eight-month lows.
Separately, USD/CAD fell 0.27% to 1.278 and USD/RUB lost 0.53% to 66.208, as the Ruble and Canadian Dollar received a boost from the rebound in oil prices.

507,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2016 04:04AM ET</span>",Doha meeting drives down commodity currencies,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity currencies slumped on Monday and the safe-haven yen soared after major crude exporters failed to agree on an output freeze, sending oil prices tumbling once again.
A plan for oil producers to freeze production at a meeting in Doha fell apart on Sunday after Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join in, leaving the credibility of the OPEC producer cartel in tatters and the world awash with unwanted fuel.
With a 5 percent fall in crude prices sapping risk appetite across markets, investors sought refuge in the yen, which hit a three-year high against the euro (EURJPY=) and traded close to a 1-1/2-year high against the dollar . By 0730 GMT it was up 0.6 percent at 109.16 yen per dollar. [O/R]
The Canadian dollar skidded by 1 percent to C$1.2948 versus its U.S. counterpart , while the Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $0.7673 . 
""After the Doha meeting, we've seen some clear risk-off sentiment coming into the day, with commodity currencies down,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt. 
Reichelt added that the failure to reach a deal at Doha was likely to spur central banks such as Sweden's Riksbank to talk about further easing, because of the deflationary effect of lower oil prices.
The euro inched up 0.2 percent to $1.1300 . But against the yen, it fell by as much as 1 percent, to a low of 121.71 yen. That was the lowest since April 4, 2013 - the day the Bank of Japan launched its massive asset buying program. 
The United States offered a cool response to concerns voiced by Tokyo that the yen's gains are too sharp and may justify intervention, with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew saying at a G20 meeting on Friday that he did not see any disorderly moves in the currency market.
The outcome of the G20 meeting and falls in Japanese equities on concerns about the economic impact from deadly earthquakes in southern Japan are negative for the dollar against the yen, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. 

""Intervention in the yen has effectively become difficult,"" Murata said. He added that weakness in Tokyo shares can erode the risk tolerance of Japanese institutional investors and make them more cautious about overseas investment.

521,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2016 06:15PM ET</span>","EUR/USD extends losses, as strong U.S. data adds support for June hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Thursday, extending sharp losses from the previous session, as the dollar surged to fresh a two weeks high after a strong batch of economic data bolstered support for a June interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1234 and 1.1295 before settling at 1.1265, down 0.0014 or 0.12% on the day. The dollar has closed higher against the euro in three consecutive sessions and four of the last six, rallying slightly from five-month lows. Previously, the greenback tumbled nearly 3% versus its European counterpart after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered its interest rate outlook on March 16 at a closely-watched meeting. The U.S. central bank now expects to raise short-term interest rates no more than twice this year, down from earlier forecasts for as much as four rate hikes in December's outlook.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The dollar continued its rebound on Thursday morning after the U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims last week fell by 13,000 to 253,000 equaling lows from early-March when the figure bottomed at the lowest level since 1973. The optimistic data followed the release of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday afternoon, which provided indications that domestic wages are starting to increase while the prolonged downturn in oil production could be on the verge of coming to an end. Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said weekly crude production fell by 31,000 bpd to 8.977 million bpd. With the sharp declines, U.S. output dipped below 9.0 million bpd for the first time since October, 2014.
Still, the gains in the dollar were limited following the release of soft consumer inflation data on Thursday morning. In March, the Consumer Price Index inched up 0.1% for the month falling slightly below consensus estimates of 0.2% gains. The Core CPI Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also rose by 0.1% one month after jumping 0.3% in February. Citing weak inflation and downbeat consumer spending Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart told Bloomberg that he will not support an April rate hike, reversing his previous stance.
In Europe, consumer inflation throughout the  euro zone rose 1.2% in March, one month after inching up by only 0.2% in February. The strong reading fell in line with consensus estimates. In Italy, CPI ticked up 0.2% last month, also matching consensus forecasts.
Fed chair Janet Yellen sent strong indications in late-March that the FOMC will express extreme caution in raising short-term interest rates as headwinds from heightened global financial risks continued to recede slowly. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its first two meetings this year.
Investors also reacted to a surprising move by the Singapore Central Bank to approve further easing measures on Thursday to boost stubbornly low core inflation. The decision sparked a sell-off in the Chinese yuan, which fell to an intraday low of 6.4876 against the dollar, its lowest level in nearly a week.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged to near two-week highs at 95.21 before settling at 94.94 at the close. On Monday, the index dipped below 94 to hit an eight-month low.

531,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2016 05:56PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls sharply, as strong China exports bolsters slumping dollar","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Wednesday, plunging to its lowest closing level in more than two weeks, as a wave of strong economic data eased fears of a global slowdown propping up the slumping dollar against its main rivals. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1268 and 1.1391, before settling at 1.1277 down 0.0096 or 0.93% on the day. With the sharp decline, the euro closed under 1.13 against the dollar for the first time in nearly a dozen sessions. The dollar has come under intense pressure in recent weeks amid strong indications from the Federal Reserve that it will delay the timing of its first interest rate hike of 2016. 
Despite Wednesday's rally, the dollar is still down more than 1.5% against its European counterpart since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered its interest rate forecast last month at a closely-watched meeting. The U.S. central bank now expects to raise short-term interest rates no more than twice this year, down from previous expectations for as much as four rate hikes in December's outlook. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
The dollar bounced from near-eight month lows on Wednesday after the Chinese government reported on Wednesday that exports surged by 11.5% in March on an annual basis, defying expectations for slight gains of 2.5%. The upbeat data bolstered investor confidence, one month after Chinese exports plummeted more than 25% in dollar terms. In renminbi terms, Chinese exports soared nearly 19% on the month while imports fell mildly in March. 
Further upward moves in the greenback were limited from soft producer price and retail sales data last month. In March, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' PPI-FD index fell by 0.1%, extending mild losses from the previous month in spite of continued increases in oil prices. Analysts expected consensus gains of 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales last month fell 0.3%, amid sharp declines in auto sales. While gasoline sales surged 0.9% as prices spiked to their highest level in two months, overall sales minus gasoline fell 0.4% in March, underscoring the impact of higher prices at the pump. 
The gains in the dollar could be ephemeral until the FOMC issues its next interest rate decision on April 27. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president Rob Kaplan said he thinks the FOMC could raise short-term interest rates in June if the economy demonstrates continued improvement, while San Francisco Fed president John Williams said the Fed should approve ""two to three rate hikes,"" before the end of the year if the current economic outlook remains unchanged. On Thursday, Fed governor Jerome Powell and Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart are scheduled to make public appearances, while Chicago Fed president Charles Evans is scheduled to deliver a speech at a JP Morgan Investor Seminar in Washington on Friday.
Last month, Fed chair Janet Yellen said the FOMC will express extreme caution in raising interest rates as headwinds from heightened global financial risks continue to recede slowly. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its first two meetings this year. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell one basis point to 1.76%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year lost four basis points to 0.13%. Government bond yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries, as well as German 10-year bunds have both plunged at least 14 basis points over the last month. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.80% on Wednesday to an intraday high of 94.85 before settling near session-highs at 94.81. On Monday, the index dipped below 94 to hit an eight-month low. 
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields. "

LONDON (Reuters) - A boost for commodity-reliant currencies from Tuesday’s jump in oil prices faded in early trade in Europe on Wednesday, while the dollar was up almost half a percent against the euro and yen, hitting a one-week high against the single currency. 
Oil was down almost 2 percent on the day, driving roughly half percent falls in the Norwegian crown and Australian and Canadian dollars. (EURNOK=)   [O/R]
It remains well above $40 a barrel, which has allowed all three to recover from long-term lows hit in January. 
This week's gains seem more to do with the prospect of producers imposing limits on output than a move away from the economic gloom that has pervaded financial markets this year and driven capital into the perceived safety of the yen. 
But some stronger data out of China and an improved tone to stock markets on Wednesday was enough to weaken both the Japanese currency and the euro. 
""Oil prices have come up and that has led to tighter credit spreads and in the end stronger equity markets,"" Constantin Bolz, director for FX strategy with UBS Wealth Management in Zurich, said. 
""That also led to dollar-yen finding a bottom and in general to a slightly stronger dollar.""
The yen was down 0.2 percent at 108.82 against the dollar, having stalled at its strongest in 17 months, 107.61 yen <JPY=>, on Monday. 
The dollar rose as high as $1.1343 per euro <EUR=>, its strongest in a week, before settling at $1.1360. The dollar index of its strength against a basket of currencies was up a third of a percent at 94.236.

EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
While lowering its global growth outlook for 2016 on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund sent additional warnings on the ""severe regional"" and ""global damage,"" the U.K. could create if voters approve a public referendum to leave the EU on June 23. In its latest Short Term Economic Outlook (STEO), the IMF said a so-called ""Brexit"" could curtail traditional trade relationships throughout the euro zone, weighing on investor confidence and increasing financial market volatility. Last month, German chancellor told a rally that the strength of the euro ""relies on the free movement of goods and services.""
Meanwhile, the IMF cut its worldwide economic growth forecast for 2016 to 3.2%, citing persistently low oil prices, a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy and weakness in advanced and emerging markets. In advanced economies in particular, the IMF expects modest growth of 2% on the year, amid weak demand, unfavorable demographics and low productivity. In January, the IMF predicted global growth of 3.4% for the year as a whole.
""Lower growth means less room for error,"" said Maurice Obstfeld, IMF Economic Counsellor and Director of Research Maurice Obstfeld said in a statement. ""Persistent slow growth has scarring effects that themselves reduce potential output and with it, demand and investment."" 
As central banks worldwide continue to rely on negative interest rate policies (NIRPs) in an effort to stave off the threat of deflation, Obstfeld emphasized that major economies cannot solely rely on monetary policy alone to achieve their stated growth targets. Instead, Obstfeld noted that the nations must implement a more potent policy mix, combining revamped structural, fiscal and monetary policies.
""If national policymakers were to clearly recognize the risks they jointly face and act together to prepare for them, the positive effects on global confidence could be substantial,"" Obstfeld said.
Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president Rob Kaplan reiterated that the Fed should remain data-dependent with the timing of its next interest rate hike, while adding that the U.S. central bank should consider raising rates in June if the economy continues to improve. Last month, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%.
""We're trying to get ourselves to a normal level of rates because there's a cost to excessive accommodation,"" Kaplan told CNBC. ""It hurts savers and creates distortions in asset allocation. I think we're going to have to take account of all the data including what currencies are doing and what's going on around the world. We'll try to move patiently but do it in a thoughtful way.""
Kaplan's comments were followed by hawkish remarks from San Francisco Fed president John Williams, who said on Tuesday that he anticipates to two to three rate hikes from the FOMC this year if the economy continues to remain strong.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 94.37, before settling slightly lower at 94.05. On Monday, the index dipped below 94 to hit an eight-month low.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2016 10:45AM ET</span>",Dollar recoups some losses vs. yen on Japan intervention fears,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar pared losses after hitting 17-month lows against the yen on Monday, as Japan again warned that it could intervene in the market to weaken the Japanese currency.
Gains in global stock markets and a rebound in oil prices have also diminished the allure of safe-haven currencies such as the yen, which fell for the first time versus the dollar in seven days.
But it was the warning by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on the yen's recent gains which spurred traders to unwind some one-sided trades on the dollar-yen. 
Suga said overnight that the Group of 20's agreement to avoid competitive devaluations did not mean Japan cannot intervene against currency moves, repeating language which has flagged intervention in the past.
""While the comments sent the yen lower overnight, the overall nervousness in global markets continues to keep the Japanese currency's safe-haven allure in high demand,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
In mid-morning trading, the dollar was little changed at 108.00 yen . Earlier the dollar fell to a 107.64 yen, the lowest since October 2014. The greenback has fallen three straight weeks against the Japanese currency.
Suga told a news conference the Japanese government was closely monitoring the currency market with a sense of urgency, calling the yen moves one-sided and speculative.
But the running logic among analysts is that Tokyo cannot easily intervene ahead of G20 meetings in Washington this week and a round of G7 summits it is hosting in May.
The yen also fell against the euro, which rose 0.4 percent to 123.69 yen (EURJPY=). The euro also rose 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.1438 .
A number of U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers are scheduled to speak this week, but analysts held out little hope that their comments would significantly revive expectations for interest rate rises this year.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen's caution on policy has cooled any thoughts of a rise before mid-year even as a number of her colleagues have sounded more bullish. 
The dollar index was down 0.5 percent at 93.819 (DXY).
""The bottom line is that an April FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) rate hike looks unlikely,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist, at Macquarie Group Limited in New York.
Still, he added that the FOMC believes that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time are still appropriate.

559,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 08, 2016 05:46PM ET</span>","EUR/USD reaches highest closing level in 5 months, amid lower U.S. GDP","Investing.com -- EUR/USD closed above 1.14 for the first time since mid-October, as the dollar remained near five-month lows on Friday, after the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said on Friday that U.S. GDP hardly grew during the first quarter.
The currency pair traded between 1.1338 and 1.1454, before closing at 1.1402, up 0.22% on the session. The euro ended the week slightly higher against the dollar, closing above 1.13 for the eighth consecutive session. Since the Fed elected to lower its long-term interest rate forecast on March 16, the euro has soared by more than 2.6% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
On Friday morning, the Atlanta Fed said its GDPNow forecast model lowered estimates of first quarter growth to 0.1%, from previous forecasts of 0.4% earlier this week. The revisions were made following a report released by the U.S. Census Bureau earlier on Friday, which detailed sharp declines in wholesale trade inventories in February. For the month, wholesale sales dropped for the fourth straight period, while auto inventories plunged by 1.0%, suffering its largest decline since September, 2013. As a result, the forecast for the contribution of inventory investment to first-quarter real GDP growth fell from Minus–0.4 percentage points to Minus–0.7 percentage points, the Atlanta Fed said in a statement. 
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, meanwhile, attempted to reassure investors on Thursday evening that the U.S. economy remains on solid footing even as she has expressed hesitancy to raise interest rates due to increased global financial risks. Yellen made the comments at a panel discussion at the International House of New York alongside former Fed chairmen Ben Bernanke and Paul Volcker. 
""This is an economy on a solid course, not a bubble economy,"" Yellen said. ""It has made tremendous progress from the damage of the financial crisis.""
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first two meetings this year. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by approving its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. At the same time, the European Central Bank enacted further easing measures last month by pushing its deposit rate deeper into negative territory. 
""There is accommodation in the monetary policy that we have. But we think the gradual path of rate increases will be appropriate,"" Yellen added. ""We remain on a reasonable path and I don't think December was a mistake.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.30% to an intraday low of 94.09, before rallying slightly to 94.22 at the close. The index remains near five-month lows from Thursday's session.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields. 
Elsewhere, USD/JPY stabilized above 108 one day after tumbling more than 1.5% to its lowest level in 17 months. It came as Japan finance minister Taro Aso attempted to reassure investors that the Bank of Japan will take the necessary steps to prevent sharp one-way moves in the yen. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained nearly three basis points to 1.71%. Earlier this week, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell to a fresh 5-week low at 1.685%.

565,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2016 08:09AM ET</span>",Yen stalls as finance minister warns on intervention,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Gains for stock markets and a warning of possible intervention from Japan's finance minister knocked back the yen on Friday after a week of startling gains.
The yen surged at one point by as much as 2 percent against the dollar on Thursday, and Minister Taro Aso responded early on Friday by warning rapid currency moves were ""undesirable,"" that the yen's were ""one-sided"" and that Japan would take steps as needed. 
That is language that Tokyo has used in the past to flag intervention, and the yen's run to 17-month highs against the dollar has required investors to believe it would hold fire at least until after next week's G20 meetings in Washington.
""Of course there is some fear in the market,"" said Manuel Oliveri, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London. 
""But one has to bear in mind that there is the G20 agreement not to, and that to work any intervention would need to be large and really that means it would need the support of the Fed and the European Central Bank.""
By 0738 GMT, the yen had lost 0.5 percent at 108.75 yen per dollar, still up more than 2 percent on the week and around 10 percent on the year so far.
The improved tone on European stock markets - still on course for their fourth straight week of losses - helped the Australian and Canadian dollars rise half a percent each. 
But overall their U.S. counterpart was marginally higher against the basket of currencies that measures its broad strength (DXY), taking some comfort from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's promise on Thursday that the U.S. central bank was on course to tighten rates gradually. 
Yellen's statement last week that the Fed should proceed cautiously in light of looming global risks to the U.S. economy have been at the heart of sharp falls over the past 10 days for the dollar against the euro and yen. 
Both of those currencies have been treated as safe havens by investors sharing growing concerns that much of the developed world is falling into a debilitating cycle of deflation that central banks are powerless to stop. 
""This is really just a bit of Friday respite,"" said a dealer with one international bank in London. ""Where we go next week seems set to depend on risk appetite again. As long as stocks are falling, the dollar will be a sell on any rallies.""
A Reuters poll of strategists released on Thursday showed the broader dollar rally that began in mid-2014 has nearly run its course and will only gain slightly over the coming year, with respondents saying risks to their forecasts are tilted more to the downside. 
The dollar inched up 0.15 percent to $1.1360 per euro in morning trade in Europe. 
""We think a combination of falling US real rates and elevated market volatility are weighing on the dollar against the current account surplus-backed euro and yen,"" analysts from  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said in a note. 

""(But) we remain constructive on the dollar against the Australian and Canadian dollars.""

571,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2016 06:12PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls mildly, as minutes show broadly unified ECB on easing","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Thursday, as the minutes from the European Central Bank's March meeting depicted a broadly unified Governing Council on the prospects of implementing comprehensive easing measures as a means for boosting economic growth throughout the euro area. 
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1338 and 1.1454, before closing at 1.1377, down 0.0022 or 0.19%. The euro closed above 1.13 versus the dollar for the seventh consecutive session. Over the last month of trading, the euro has surged more than 3.3% against its American counterpart amid strong indications that the Federal Reserve and the ECB will avoid even sharper divergences at least for the time being. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
The minutes from the ECB's March policy meeting, released on Thursday morning, showed a broadly united Governing Council, which appeared to be supportive of the decisions made by president Mario Draghi. At the closely-watched meeting last month, the ECB lowered its deposit rate deeper into negative territory by reducing it by 0.1 to Minus-0.4%. The Governing Council also cut the marginal lending rate by 0.05 to 0.25% and the refinance rate by 0.05% to zero. At the same time, the central bank increased the size of monthly purchases with its bond-buying program by €20 billion to €80 billion a month and extended the program by several months through March, 2017.
""Taking into account the views expressed by the members of the governing council, the president concluded that a large majority of voting members supported the proposed policy package,"" the minutes stated. ""Overall, the recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue at a more subdued pace, while the risks to the growth outlook were mostly seen to remain tilted to the downside. These risks related in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding the external environment and to broader geopolitical risks.""
""Against this background, members reiterated the necessity for other policy areas to support sustained output growth and that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient. There was a need for both structural reforms and fiscal policy to also play their part.""
Investors also digested hawkish minutes from the Fed that it will remain cautious with the timing of future interest rate hikes in the near-term. At the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) March meeting, the U.S. central bank held the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25-0.50%. While some members were inclined to consider raising short-term interest rates later this month, the minutes from the March meeting suggest that the committee remains concerned about heightened global financial and economic risks abroad. Specifically, the majority of the members agreed that there could be little room to ease policy through conventional means if the economy or inflation suffered an unexpected shock. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, reached an intraday high of 94.67 on Thursday, before falling back to 94.50 (up 0.01%) at the close. The index remains near five-month lows. 
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to take advantage of higher yields. On bond markets, yields on the U.S. 10-Year tumbled seven basis points to 1.68%, their lowest level in nearly two months.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2016 07:20AM ET</span>",China's FX reserves post surprise rise in March on more stable yuan,"By Meng Meng and Kevin Yao
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves surprisingly rose in March, the first monthly gain since November, as cooling expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes eased pressure on the yuan.
Chinese authorities have taken a raft of measures to curb outflows sparked by concerns over the slowing economy and U.S. interest rate rises, and intervened in the currency market to support the yuan .
China's foreign exchange reserves - the world's largest - climbed $10.26 billion in March to $3.21 trillion, central bank data showed on Thursday. The reserves beat a Reuters poll forecast of a drop to $3.18 trillion from $3.20 trillion in February, but are still down sharply from a peak of $3.99 trillion in June 2014. 
The reserves fell by $28.57 billion in February, after plummeting $99.5 billion in January and $107.9 billion in December, the biggest monthly drop on record.
""Looking ahead, we believe that the pressure on CNY will moderate somewhat, while the capital outflows are likely to continue over the foreseeable future,"" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
CURRENCY VALUATION EFFECTS
Analysts believed the rise in reserves in March was partly due to favorable currency valuation effects, as the euro and Japanese yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar in the month. 
Zhou estimated that the valuation effect was about $30 billion in March, implying net outflows in the month. 
Recent data showed capital outflows from China have moderated, in part helped by expectations the Fed will slow the pace of interest rate rises this year. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments last week that the U.S. central bank should proceed cautiously in adjusting policy have caused a broad-based retreat in the dollar. 
Chinese officials have said the economy was showing signs of improvement while capital outflows were easing.
To be sure, analysts believe that China still faces a tough job keeping the yuan stable, particularly at a time of persistent supply glut and tepid domestic demand. 
The yuan will come under renewed downward pressure if the U.S. dollar rises significantly in coming months, a policy adviser to the People's Bank of China said last month.
The PBOC has moved to curb currency speculation since late December 2015, including limiting yuan-based funds' overseas investments and implementing a reserve requirement ratio on offshore banks' domestic yuan deposits. It has also started to manage the yuan against a basket of currencies.
""The currency policy changes put in place after mid-January are showing a strict adherence to the basket peg. It is a more disciplined policy,"" said Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING in Singapore. 
""The Chinese government sees the narrowing of the foreign reserve declines as a welcome side effect of the policy.""
The PBOC published forex reserves denominated in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDR) for the first time. The reserves were equivalent to 2.28 trillion SDR.
The central bank said the SDR measure would help limit valuation changes in the reserves caused by currency volatility. 
""This would also help enhance the role of the SDR as a unit of account,"" the central bank said in a statement.
The IMF admitted China's yuan into its benchmark currency basket in November last year, a victory for Beijing's campaign for recognition as a global economic power.

Separately, ECB President Mario Draghi warned that 2016 would be another challenging year in the bank’s annual report on Thursday.
“We face uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy. We face continued disinflationary forces. And we face questions about the direction of Europe and its resilience to new shocks,” the report said.
The euro remained supported against the broadly weaker dollar after Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting indicated that an interest rate hike at its meeting later this month is unlikely.
The dovish tone of the minutes underscored comments by Fed Chair Janet Yellen who said last week that risks to the global economic outlook justified taking a cautious approach to tightening monetary policy.
The dollar was hovering near five-and-a-half month lows against the other major currencies.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 94.45, not far from overnight lows of 94.24.
Lower interest rates make the dollar less attractive to yield seeking investors.
The dollar fell to fresh 17-month lows against the yen, with USD/JPY dropping 1.29% to 108.34.

The yen extended gains from the previous session after comments by Japan’s prime minister indicated that authorities would not rush to arrest the appreciation of the currency.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said late Tuesday that countries should avoid weakening their currencies with ""arbitrary intervention.""
The yen’s gains have fueled speculation over how much higher the currency can climb before Japanese officials act to weaken it.
The Bank of Japan shocked markets with its decision to adopt negative interest rates earlier this year but the yen has continued to strengthen, posing a challenge to the central bank’s attempts to spur price growth."

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen powered to a 17-month high against the dollar on Thursday, with the U.S. currency broadly under pressure after minutes of the Federal Reserve's meeting last month underscored its caution about future interest rate hikes.
The yen's surge -- up 9.6 percent against the dollar so far this year -- led to more warnings of action from the Japanese who are concerned about a strong currency dampening exports. A senior Japanese finance ministry official said it would take steps in the market as needed. 
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also repeated that the central bank would ease policy further if needed, but there are doubts over how effective that would be. 
The dollar fell 1 percent to 108.65 yen , its weakest against its Japanese counterpart since October 2014. The euro slid to 124.12 yen (EURJPY=R), its lowest in a month.
""We are in a broad-based soft dollar environment and given the yen is cheap in relation to its long-term fundamentals, it is not surprising it is outperforming,"" said Petr Krpata, FX strategist at ING.
""The rise is leading to speculation of intervention by the Japanese. But we think the bar for that is pretty high and we are not seeing any major risk-off event.""
The market is sceptical about the chances of yen-selling intervention ahead of a G7 summit that Japan is hosting in May, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
""It may be tough for Japan's MOF to take the initiative and charge toward intervention,"" Okagawa said, referring to the ministry of finance, which has jurisdiction over Japan's currency policy. 
""If the dollar were to suddenly fall below 100 yen, that may justify action to adjust the speed of the moves, but I think that would be a last resort.""
The dollar index, which tracks it against a basket of six major currencies, fell to 94.015 (DXY), its lowest since October last year.
Minutes from the Fed's March 15-16 policy meeting suggested that the central bank appears unlikely to raise interest rates before June due to widespread concern among policymakers over their limited ability to counter the blow of a global economic slowdown. 
The minutes showed debate over whether they might increase rates in April with ""a number"" of them arguing that headwinds to growth would probably persist, and many urging caution about raising rates.

The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.14205 , not far from a 5-1/2-month high of $1.1438 touched last week. Minutes of the last European Central Bank meeting will be released on Thursday with traders also looking to a speech later in the day by its president, Mario Draghi.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2016 03:20AM ET</span>",Asia forex gloom lifts on dollar retreat and dovish Fed: Reuters poll,"By Sumanta Dey
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Emerging Asian currencies are set to weaken further in the coming year, but not as much as thought a few months ago, as expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more cautiously hold back the dollar, a Reuters poll showed.
Still, with many Asian central banks continuing to ease policy, the consensus from over 60 analysts polled by Reuters this week was for regional currencies to weaken 2-6 percent by this time next year, with the Malaysian ringgit <MYR=> leading the pack.
""With the Fed delivering a dovish message, Asia FX may continue to perform in the short term. We reckon, however, that the strength is unlikely to hold through the year, and expect some weakness to return,"" analysts at Citi wrote in a note.
China's yuan has been one of the main sources of global financial market turmoil since last August, when the People's Bank of China devalued it in an attempt to support economic growth as risks of a sharp slowdown began to mount.
The year got off to a volatile start for emerging markets with the Chinese currency sliding again, but since then, Asian currencies have found their footing.
That happened in part when Beijing tried to calm investors by fixing the yuan higher in rapid succession, along with better economic data in developed economies, particularly the United States, that swung sentiment back in favor of riskier assets.
But the closely-managed yuan <CNY=CFXS>, also known as the renminbi, is expected to fall further. Median forecasts from a poll of 65 strategists are for it to ease to 6.58 per dollar by end-June and 6.70 by end-March in 2017, about 3 percent weaker from 6.47 on Thursday.
Only last month, the consensus was for it to fall more than 3.5 percent in 12 months.
Beijing has had to burn through almost half a trillion dollars to support the yuan since the middle of last year. Policymakers have insisted they see no reason for the yuan to depreciate further, which has helped stem huge capital outflows and calm investors.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists noted: ""a one-off devaluation is unlikely, considering the potential risks likely far outweigh the rewards,"" adding that would likely trigger aggressive currency depreciations by other emerging countries.
With economic growth in China likely to slow to between 6.5 - 7.0 percent this year, coupled with an over-inflated housing market, some strategists have yet to completely write off the risk of another sharp down move on the yuan.
An improved outlook for the Chinese yuan is usually a proxy for currencies of other Asian countries which trade heavily with the world's second-largest economy.
Prospects for the Indian rupee <INR=> and South Korean won <KRW=> have also improved on growing expectations the Fed will deliver fewer rate increases this year. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments last week that the U.S. central bank should proceed cautiously in adjusting policy have caused a broad-based retreat in the dollar.
Minutes of the Fed's March policy meeting, released on Wednesday, also showed widespread concern at the U.S. central bank over its limited ability to weather a global economic slowdown.
""Near term, there are no reasons for a stronger dollar,"" said Esther Reichelt, foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""The baseline scenario of the Fed envisages that the dollar does not appreciate any further. In the market's opinion, Yellen has thereby confirmed that a stronger dollar will keep the Fed acting cautiously until it feels more certain about its inflation outlook – and that takes time.""
The Indian rupee, trading around 66.50 a dollar on Thursday, would fall around 2 percent to 67.60 by end-June and further to 68.00 in a year, the poll showed. Analysts had predicted USD/INR at 69.00 in 12 months in the March survey.
The Malaysian ringgit <MYR=> will likely lead losses and fall 6 percent to 4.17 per U.S. dollar by end-March 2017 from Wednesday's close of 3.914, while the Philippine peso <PHP=>, Taiwan dollar <TWD=> and Singapore dollar <SGD=> are seen weakening about 4 percent.

584,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 06, 2016 06:28PM ET</span>","EUR/USD inches up, as minutes depict a Fed split on timing of next hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD inched up, remaining largely unchanged after the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting on Wednesday afternoon portrayed a fractious U.S. central bank, divided on whether it will be appropriate to raise short-term interest rates at the end of this month. 
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1327 and 1.1431, before settling at 1.1397, up 0.0017 or 0.14% on the session. The euro halted a brief two-day losing streak from the start of the week, which came in response to a strong five-day rally last week. With the slight gains, EUR/USD closed above 1.13 for the sixth straight session. Since the Federal Reserve lowered its long-term interest rate forecast on March 16, the euro has soared more than 2.4% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last met in mid-March, several members wanted to consider the possibility of raising interest rates at the meeting, while leaving a potential rate hike on the table when it meets again on April 26-27. The majority of the members expressed caution at raising rates prematurely, the minutes showed, amid concerns that global economic headwinds will only ""subside slowly,"" in the near-term future. Kansas City Fed president Esther George dissented at the meeting, judging that the Committee should place a higher priority on meeting its ""longer-run objectives,"" above short-term pressure from a risky global economy. 
At the meeting, the FOMC voted 9-1 to hold its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%, with George serving as the lone dissented. The FOMC has left short-term rates steady at each of its first two meetings this year, following its historic meeting in December when it abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by implementing a 25 basis point hike.
With rates at near-zero levels, other members appeared worried that the FOMC might be running out of ammunition to bolster the economy in the case it suffered an unforeseen shock. 
In terms of inflation, the FOMC noted that Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) appeared to ""pick up"" in the first quarter, in light of gains in motor vehicle sales and real disposable income in January. Earlier in the first quarter the Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose to 1.7%, its highest level since February, 2013. Core PCE inflation is the FOMC's preferred gauge for price stability. Still, the majority of the members saw downside risks to their inflation forecasts on a longer term basis. Core PCE inflation has remained under the Fed's 2% targeted objective for every month over the last three years. 
A wave of FOMC policymakers are scheduled to speak later this week, including Yellen, who will appear at a panel with former Fed chairmen Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker on Thursday in New York. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.25% to an intraday low of 94.25, before inching back up to settle at 94.49.

GBP/USD was last down 0.23% at 1.4227 from around 1.4220 ahead of the report.
The Markit services purchasing managers index came in at 53.7 in March, up from February’s near three year low of 52.7 and matching economists’ expectations.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Despite the slight advance from February levels, March rounded off the weakest quarter of output growth in the British services sector since the first quarter of 2013.
The data also revealed the slowest increase in new business since January 2013.
Global economic uncertainty and the upcoming European Union membership referendum weighed on business confidence, the report said.
The lackluster data indicated that the Bank of England will be in no rush to raise interest rates.
""It therefore seems unlikely that March’s upturn in the pace of growth represents the start of a longer term upswing,” Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said.
“In contrast, the survey data suggest growth is more likely to weaken further in the second quarter. With the PMI already in territory traditionally associated with the Bank of England choosing to loosen policy, interest rate hikes seem a long way off.”
Sterling was slightly lower against the euro, with EUR/GBP easing up 0.13% to 0.7991.

604,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2016 05:37PM ET</span>",EUR/USD inches up as euro zone unemployment falls to fresh 4-year lows,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD inched up on Monday, barely extending a 7-day winning streak, as unemployment in the euro area fell slightly in February to hit its lowest level in more than four years. 
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1357 and 1.1412, before settling at 1.1391, up 0.0002 or 0.02% on the session. With the slight gains, the euro remained near five-month highs versus the dollar. The euro is coming off its strongest quarter against the dollar since the first quarter of 2011, after surging by more than 4.75% versus its American counterpart in the opening three months of the year. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Monday, EUR/USD rose to session-highs after Eurostat reported that monthly unemployment in the euro zone inched down 0.1 to a seasonally-adjusted 10.3% in February, its lowest level since August, 2011. The reading fell in line with consensus estimates. More encouragingly, the unemployment rate in the EU 28 remained at 8.9%, down 0.8% from its level 12 months ago. Unemployment among the 28-nation bloc is at its lowest level since May, 2009. 
Elsewhere, investors continued to digest an optimistic March U.S. jobs report from the end of last week, which provided broad signals of improved labor market conditions nationwide. For the month, U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 215,000 in March, eclipsing consensus estimates of 210,000 and building on an upwardly revised 245,000 figure a month earlier. In addition, average hourly earnings jumped by 0.3% for the month, while the labor force participation rate also increased by 0.1 to 63%. Although the employment rate inched up by 0.1 to 5.0%, it still remains near eight-year lows from the previous two months. 
The report came in the wake of dovish indications from Fed chair Janet Yellen that the U.S. central bank will express caution in approving further rate hikes against a backdrop of heightened global economic and financial risks. A wave of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policymakers, including Yellen are scheduled to speak later this week. On Monday, however, Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren said he expects the Fed to resume a path of gradual tightening ""sooner than implied by financial market futures,"" if the economy continues to exhibit moderate recovery.""
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained 0.01 on Monday to settle at 94.59. The index still remains near five-month lows. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell one basis point to 1.76%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year were flat at 0.13%. Government bond yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries remained near five-week lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit its lowest level against the yen in more than two weeks on Monday and was lower against a basket of major currencies on continued expectations of a slow path of Federal Reserve rate increases this year. 
The dollar, which posted its worst week in roughly two months last week, fell as low as 111.10 yen  on Monday. Comments last week by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that the central bank should proceed ""cautiously"" on raising interest rates continued to weigh on the dollar, analysts said. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.07 percent at 94.551, not far from a 5-1/2-month low of 94.319 touched last week. The euro was last up 0.04 percent against the dollar, at $1.1390, after touching a 5-1/2-month high of $1.1437 on Friday.
""You have a continued flow-through from the Yellen comments,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. 
He said traders were unwinding bets that the dollar would appreciate against the yen in response to the Yellen's dovish remarks and on the Bank of Japan's taking a less dovish approach than expected.
The dollar index had briefly erased losses earlier after Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said it was ""surprising"" that futures markets currently imply one or zero rate hikes this year. Rosenberg, who is typically dovish, said market predictions could prove ""too pessimistic."" 
Fed funds futures contracts on Monday suggested traders saw just a 40 percent chance of a Fed rate hike in July, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. Although the Fed also has policy meetings scheduled for both later this month and in June, July is the first meeting where the chances of a hike are seen as even significant, according to FedWatch.
The dollar is ""going to be mired in a range"" given the aftereffects of Yellen's dovish comments from last week, said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.

The dollar was last down 0.32 percent against the yen at 111.31 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was last up 0.17 percent, at 0.9591 franc, after touching a more than five-month low of 0.9547 franc last week .

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1338 and 1.1437, before settling at 1.1389, up 0.008 or 0.07% on the session. The euro hit fresh 5-month highs on Friday morning, before the dollar trimmed losses after the release of the mostly upbeat data. In the last month alone, the euro has surged nearly 5% against its American counterpart, as longstanding concerns related to a sharp divergence in monetary policies has faded. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said nonfarm payrolls rose by 215,000 in March, slightly above consensus estimates of 210,000 and extending encouraging gains from February when the labor market added an upwardly revised 245,000 nonfarm positions. The gains were concentrated in Retail Trade, Construction and Health Care, which all exhibited considerable increases over the month. After adding 48,000 jobs in March, the Retail Trade sector has grown by more than 375,000 during the last year.
""The remarkable U.S. recovery continues, as total nonfarm employment increased by 215,000 in March. Beginning just a year after President Obama inherited the worst economic crisis in generations, businesses have been adding jobs at an extended, record-setting clip: a total of 14.4 million jobs over the last 73 consecutive months of private-sector job growth,"" U.S. labor secretary Thomas Perez said in a statement.
""There are so many reasons to be bullish about our economic future, but we can’t become complacent about the challenges that remain. Continued weakness in manufacturing, for example, is a reminder that we must keep working to restore balance to the economy, to ensure that the recovery benefits people in all communities, up and down the income spectrum.""
Although the unemployment rate inched up by 0.1 to 5.0%, it still remains near eight-year lows from the previous two months. The U-6 unemployment rate, which factors in workers marginally attached to the labor force, as well as part-time workers, rose slightly to 9.8%. By comparison, the U-6 rate stood at 10.9% last March and reached as high as 18.0% at the height of the Great Recession. The reading is the Fed's preferred gauge for unemployment, as it judges the strength of the labor market.

Earlier this week, Yellen said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will likely raise rates gradually in light of heightened global economic and financial risks. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first two meetings this year.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2016 08:30PM ET</span>",Dollar nurses quarterly losses as U.S. jobs data awaited,"By Lisa Twaronite
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar licked its wounds on Friday after taking steep quarterly losses against major rivals, as investors awaited the nonfarm payrolls report for the latest reading on U.S. labor conditions and potential clues to the monetary policy outlook.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, edged down slightly to 94.565 (DXY), after shedding more than 4 percent in the first quarter for its worst performance since the third quarter of 2010. It notched a five-month low of 94.319 in the previous session.
On Tuesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen highlighted risks to the global economy in a speech, and said the Fed should proceed ""cautiously"" on raising interest rates, quashing the hopes of those who expected a hike sooner rather than later.
Lower U.S. yields undermined the dollar, as Treasuries marked their best quarter in 4-1/2 years.
The nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show that employers added 205,000 jobs in March.  
""We believe that dollar bulls will be sorely disappointed by tomorrow's report for a numbers of reasons,"" Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York, said in a note to clients.
""Non-farm payrolls is only important when it can be a game changer for Federal Reserve policy but Janet Yellen made it very clear that they have no intention of raising interest rates in April and unless there's significant improvements at home and abroad, rates will remain steady in June as well,"" Lien said.
After Yellen's speech, interest rates futures implied a majority of traders saw only a 5 percent chance of a rate increase at the Fed's next policy meeting on April 26-27.
Against the yen, the dollar slipped about 0.2 percent to 112.38  after skidding more than 6 percent in the first quarter, its biggest loss since the third quarter of 2009, as market turmoil sent investors into the perceived safety of the Japanese currency.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey of business confidence, published earlier on Friday, showed large manufacturers' business sentiment deteriorated to its lowest level in nearly three years and was expected to worsen in the coming quarter.
Large manufacturers expect the dollar to average 117.46 yen in the fiscal year which began on Friday, the survey showed. 

The euro edged up about 0.1 percent to $1.1386 , after gaining more than 4 percent for the quarter and hitting a more than 5-month high of $1.4120 on Thursday.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1310 and 1.1412 before settling at 1.1380, up 0.0078 or 0.41% on the session. At session highs, the euro reached its highest level versus the greenback since mid-October. For the quarter, the euro soared by more than 4.75% against its American counterpart, building steam over the last week amid extremely dovish indications from Janet Yellen on a delayed interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. It marked the strongest three-month period for the euro since the first quarter of 2011, when it jumped 5.8% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Friday, the second quarter will kick off with March's critical U.S. jobs report, which could provide key insight into the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision-making process when it meets next in late-April. Earlier this week, Yellen noted that the U.S. economy has displayed remarkable resiliency as the labor market continues to exhibit dramatic improvements. Analysts expect monthly nonfarm payrolls to increase by 210,000 for the month, while the unemployment rate  remains steady at 4.9%. In February, U.S. non-farm payrolls shot up by 240,000, pushing the three-month average above 225,000.
While the headline unemployment rate remained at eight-year lows last month, economists were also encouraged by a 0.2% decline in U-6 unemployment, a broader gauge of the employment situation nationwide. The U-6 rate, which measures the level of workers marginally attached to the labor markets and no longer actively looking for a job, stood at 9.7% in February. By comparison, the Fed's preferred gauge of U.S. unemployment, peaked at 18% in 2010 at the end of the Financial Crisis. Analysts will also keep a close eye on monthly wage gains after average hourly earnings slumped by 0.1% a month earlier.
Also on Thursday, Federal Reserve of Chicago president Charles Evans indicated that he could support a June interest rate hike with sufficient improvements in the economy, one day after strongly hinting that it could be premature to raise short-term rates in April. The FOMC has held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% at its first two meetings of the new year. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.30% to an intraday low of 94.30, hovering near five-month lows. The index closed on Thursday with one of its worst quarters in more than five years. Both USD/CAD and USD/JPY lost more than 6% on the quarter.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell to a five-week low at 1.769% on Thursday, ending the day at near-session lows. Over the last year, government bond yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries are down by 15 basis points."

631,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2016 10:40AM ET</span>","Dollar gains share of global FX reserves, euro shrinks ","By Richard Leong and Anirban Nag
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's share of allocated global currency reserves grew for a second straight quarter, while euro's share declined further to its smallest in nearly 14 years, according to data from the International Monetary Fund released on Thursday. 
The greenback's share of allocated currency reserves rose to 64.06 percent of the total allocated reserves in the fourth quarter of 2015, equivalent to $4.36 trillion, from 63.98 percent in the third quarter of last year.
The rebound in the dollar's share coincided with signs of global market stability in the latter part of 2015. In the first half of last year, there was evidence central banks, especially those in emerging markets, sold their holdings of greenbacks in a bid to shore up their weakening currencies.
The euro's share, meanwhile, shrank for an eighth consecutive quarter to 19.91 percent from 20.34 percent in the prior quarter, the latest IMF data showed. At its peak in 2009, the euro's share of global reserves was 28 percent.
""With China's share coming as part of the allocated reserves, it becomes tricky to analyze this data. But it is not a surprise that euro's share has dipped in the fourth-quarter,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. 
Global foreign exchange reserves fell for a second quarter to $10.92 trillion from $11.19 trillion in the prior quarter. The total amount of allocated currency holdings, however, grew to $6.8 trillion from $6.6 trillion in the third quarter.
It had long been speculated that China did not report its reserves to the IMF and the country's asset holdings were part of the unallocated reserves component totaling $4.118 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2015.
China began reporting in the second quarter of 2015 a representative portfolio on a partial basis and will gradually increase to full coverage of foreign exchange reserve assets within two to three years, according to the IMF.
China's foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, fell $107.9 billion in December to $3.33 trillion, the biggest monthly drop on record.
Its reserves have shrunk more in early 2016, albeit at a slower pace. In February, they fell to $3.20 trillion, the lowest level since December 2011, central bank data showed.

On Thursday, the People's Bank of China released data on its derivatives positions on foreign currencies against the yuan for the first time. They showed that the PBOC held a nominal short position of $28.9 billion and $2.438 billion of total long positions at the end of February.

641,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 30, 2016 05:16PM ET</span>","EUR/USD extends gains, as expectations for April rate hike fade","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose moderately on Wednesday extending gains from the previous session as currency traders continued to digest extremely dovish comments from Janet Yellen, which provided strong indications that the Federal Reserve could push back the timing of its next interest rate hike beyond the first half of the year.
The currency pair traded between 1.1286 and 1.1364 before settling at 1.1337, up 0.0047 or 0.43% on the session. With one trading day left in March, the dollar is on pace for its worst monthly performance in more than five years. As a result, the euro has surged more than 4% against its American counterpart during that span and is up sharply from its level of 1.0860 at the start of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Investors continued to react to Yellen's remarks on Tuesday at a closely-watched speech before The Economic Club of New York, when the Fed chair emphasized that any rate hikes from the Fed will likely take place in a gradual manner unless considerable global and financial risks recede in the near-term future. Yellen's comments contradict the hawkish positions of four of her colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which suggested last week that the U.S. Central Bank should approve up to three rate hikes this year. Earlier this month, the FOMC held the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate between 0.25 and 0.50%, marking the second straight meeting it left rates unchanged following December's historic rate hike.
While Yellen acknowledged that the U.S. economy has demonstrated remarkable resiliency as the labor market continues to flourish, she expressed significant concern regarding soft manufacturing and export levels, as well as declining capital expenditures. Notably, Yellen cited research from Federal Reserve of Chicago president Charles Evans on the policy direction that should be undertaken by the Fed in periods of increased uncertainty when short-term rates remain low. In a 2015 paper entitled ""Risk Management for Monetary Policy Near the Zero Lower Bound,"" Evans and others argued that increased risks on nominal interest rates call for ""greater gradualism,"" in comparison with environments when rates are ""appreciably above zero.""
On Wednesday, Evans reiterated that he expects the Fed to raise interest rates as much as two times this year, with an April rate hike likely off the table. Much like Yellen, Evans is cautious of lifting rates too quickly as inflation in the euro zone and elsewhere remains stubbornly low.
""I think moving in June would be on the basis of further improvements in the labor market,"" Evans told CNBC. ""I just don't think we want to get ahead of ourselves.""
The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool lowered the probability of a September rate hike to 35.6% on Wednesday, down from 57.0% last month. In addition, the CME Group said there is a 16.8% chance the Fed will raise rates twice more before the end of December, considerably below a 39.7% probability one month ago.
Elsewhere, European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure emphasized that negative interest rates are not the main tool at the Governing Council's disposal as it looks for ways to boost sluggish inflation. Speaking exclusively with Politico, Coeure also noted that it is unlikely that the ECB will begin offering ""helicopter money,"" or direct cash to consumers as a way of bolstering economic growth throughout the region. Earlier this month, the ECB lowered its deposit rate deeper into negative territory at a meeting in Frankfurt.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.35% to an intraday low of 94.57, its lowest level since mid-October, before settling at 94.79. The index is on pace for its worst month since 2010. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Yields on the U.S. 2-Year fell to a one-month low below 0.8%, as the yield curve between long and short-term U.S. government bond yields steepened. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose two basis points to 1.82%."

650,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 29, 2016 05:17PM ET</span>","EUR/USD posts sharp gains, as Yellen takes dovish stance on future hikes","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose sharply on Tuesday extending gains from the previous session, after Janet Yellen dragged down the dollar by strongly emphasizing that the Federal Reserve should proceed cautiously in normalizing its current monetary policy cycle.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1169 and 1.1303, before settling at 1.1292, up 0.0097 or 0.87% on the session. At session highs, the euro eclipsed 1.13 versus the dollar for the first time in eight sessions. It came one day after EUR/USD halted a seven-day losing streak on Monday, triggered by hawkish remarks from Yellen's colleagues that the Fed should implement more than one interest rate hike on the calendar year.
The dollar is headed for its worst month in more than five years.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Citing increased risks with global financial and economic conditions, as well as longstanding concerns with the price of oil, Yellen reiterated that only gradual increases in the Fed's benchmark Federal Funds Rate should be warranted in the coming years. The Federal Open Market Committee has held the Fed Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% for each of the last two meetings since abandoning a seven-year zero interest rate policy in December.
""Implicitly, this expectation of fading headwinds and a rising neutral rate is a key reason for the FOMC's assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time will likely be appropriate,"" Yellen said at a speech before The Economic Club of New York. ""That said, this assessment is only a forecast. The future path of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and inflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways. Reflecting global economic and financial developments since December, however, the pace of rate increases is now expected to be somewhat slower.""
While Yellen noted that the domestic economy has displayed remarkable resiliency as the labor market shows improvement, she emphasized that a slowing global economy continues to spillover into the U.S. In particular, Yellen indicated that the FOMC is concerned with slowing manufacturing and export levels amid a weak economic outlook in China.
""There is a consensus that China's economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth,"" Yellen said. ""There is much uncertainty, however, about how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it. These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China's exchange rate policy.""
Yellen's remarks also contradict a wave of hawkish comments from centrist Fed policymakers, who have argued that the Fed should implement multiple rate hikes before the end of the year amid rising inflation and sharp declines in the dollar. Last week in an unexpected development, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker and San Francisco Fed president John Williams all supported  further tightening measures from the U.S. central bank over the next several months.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.85% to an intraday low of 95.08 before settling at 95.18. The index is down by more than 1% over the last month of trading. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell eight basis points to 1.80%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year lost four basis points to 0.14%. Government bond yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell considerably following Yellen's comments.

The currency pair traded between 1.1154 and 1.1219 before settling at 1.1196, up 0.0030 or 0.27% on the session. Previously, the euro had fallen in seven consecutive sessions since reaching five-month highs against the dollar on March 17. More broadly, the euro is up more than 3% versus its American counterpart since the start of the year.

On Monday morning, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said personal income in February rose 0.2%, slightly above consensus estimates of a 0.1% increase from the previous month. It came one month after robust gains of 0.5% in January. More importantly, consumer spending in February inched up 0.1%, following sharp downward revisions from 0.5% to 0.1% a month earlier. Within the report, retail sales were revised downward to minus 0.4% for January, joining durable and non-durable in contraction territory.
In terms of inflation, the PCE Price Index fell 0.1% in February, in line with consensus estimates, one month after ticking up by 0.1% in January. On a yearly basis, PCE prices increased by 1.0%, after surging 1.3% during the first month of the year. The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inched up by 0.1%, slightly below consensus' forecasts of 0.2%. On an annual basis, Core PCE prices, were up 1.7% over the last 12 months, remaining unchanged from January's yearly level. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, has remained under its targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta cut its GDP growth forecast for the first quarter from 1.4% to 0.6%, in the wake of the downbeat consumer spending data. At the same time, the Atlanta Fed reported that the contribution of net exports to 1st quarter real GDP growth from Minus 0.26% to Minus 0.52%, amid lower than expected international trade data on Monday.
The soft data could compel the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to push back the timing of its next rate hike beyond April. Investors await a closely-watched speech by Fed chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday for further signals of possible dissension among top policymakers at the FOMC. Yellen's comments come several days after St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker and San Francisco Fed president John Williams all supported further tightening from the U.S. central bank in the coming months.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.20% to an intraday low of 95.84, before settling at 95.99. The index is down by roughly 1% over the last month of trading. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2016 03:51PM ET</span>",Dollar slips after soft U.S. data pushes out Fed rate hike bets ,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased against a basket of major currencies on Monday after U.S. data showing retreating inflation and a downward revision to consumer spending dampened expectations for a swifter pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, eased from a 1-1/2-week high of 96.399 to a session low of 95.836 after the Commerce Department said consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent and the January reading was downwardly revised to 0.1 percent.
The data also showed U.S. inflation moderated last month, with a price index for consumer spending dipping 0.1 percent after nudging up 0.1 percent in January.
The euro gained against the dollar to $1.1218, its highest level since March 23. The data dampened expectations that the Fed would hike rates again in April or June after hawkish remarks from multiple Fed presidents last week had raised expectations for a faster pace of rate increases. 
""It looks like we’ve had an unimpressive start to growth in Q1, and that’s maybe tempering some of the recent rise in Fed tightening expectations for June,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in New York.
Low trading volumes likely contributed to price activity since European markets were closed for the Easter Monday holiday, analysts said. The weak data was enough to crimp the dollar index's rally of more than 1 percent last week. 
Analysts also said traders were awaiting comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday. Traders will monitor the speech to determine whether or not it confirms recent hawkish rhetoric from Fed officials, said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York.
More U.S. economic data will be released later this week, including March non-farm payrolls and consumer confidence data.
The dollar index was last down 0.18 percent at 95.965. The euro was last up 0.28 percent against the dollar at $1.1195 <EUR=>, and the greenback was down 0.39 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.9733 franc . 
The dollar was up 0.27 percent against the Japanese yen at 113.35 yen <JPY=>. 

On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index was last up 0.12 percent.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2016 03:47AM ET</span>",China's yuan to face pressure if dollar rises sharply: c.bank adviser,"BOAO, China (Reuters) - China's yuan will come under renewed downward pressure if the U.S. dollar rises significantly in coming months, a policy adviser to the People's Bank of China said on Friday.
Huang Yiping, a professor at Peking University and a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, also said the central bank was managing the yuan  against a basket of currencies including the dollar, not again the dollar alone, reaffirming the official stance.
""If the dollar is going to rise significantly further in the coming months, then I think pressure on the renminbi will continue,"" Huang told an annual forum in Boao, on the southern Chinese island of Hainan. 
Recent official data showed a moderation in capital outflows from China as the yuan stabilized, partly due to the dollar's broad retreat as expectations cool on the pace of U.S. interest rate rises this year.
Huang said the government has more room to maneuver with its fiscal policy than with monetary policy, and said it could be used to promote structural reforms. 
Top leaders have pledged to make monetary policy more flexible this year even as it leans more on increased fiscal spending and tax cuts to support economic growth and cushion the pain from structural reforms.
The PBOC has cut interest rates six times since November 2014 and has also repeatedly reduced the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves to encourage more lending. The last policy easing was on Feb. 29 when the central bank lowered the reserve requirement ratio.
Huang suggested that monetary policy easing may have played a role in pushing up property prices, as the government struggles to contain risks of overheating in some big cities.
""We have to be very cautious when we look at asset markets. If asset prices climb, they will come down one day,"" he said.
Municipal authorities in Shanghai tightened mortgage down payment requirements for second home purchases on Friday, in a move to cool an overheating property market and reduce fears of a bubble.
China's rising non-performing loans in the banking sector are worrisome as the actual levels may be higher than the official figures suggest, Huang said.
China's lenders are facing increasing bad loans and credit risks as a government campaign to reduce capacity weighs on the manufacturing sector and as broader economic growth slows.

Bad loans at China's commercial banks swelled to a decade-high 1.27 trillion yuan ($194.8 billion) in 2015 as growth in the world's second-biggest economy cooled to the slowest in 25 years.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2016 11:10PM ET</span>",Dollar poised for weekly gain after Fed officials signal rate hikes,"By Lisa Twaronite
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was on track on Friday for a weekly gain of over 1 percent against a basket of currencies after a chorus of U.S. Federal Reserve officials signaled more interest rate increases than the market had been pricing in.
The latest was St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said on Thursday that another U.S. interest rate hike ""may not be far off"" and noted labor market improvement.
""There's not a lot that will come"" in terms of data before the U.S. central bank's April 26-27 policy meeting, Bullard told reporters. ""I'd like to be confident that inflation expectations are stabilizing, and hopefully increasing.""
This week's hawkish remarks followed the central bank's March meeting last week, in which the Fed halved its rate hike expectations to two from four for this year.
Trading globally was likely to be thin, with many key markets, including Australia, the UK and the United States, closed to observe Good Friday. Some will be closed Monday as well after Sunday's Easter holiday.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, added about 0.2 percent to 96.285 (DXY). It was poised to rise 1.3 percent for the week, its first such gain this month.
The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 113.04 <JPY=>. It was up 1.3 percent for the week and well above last week's 17-month low of 110.67 yen.
""The 114 yen handle will come in view for the dollar if next week's U.S. data show a good pace of job growth, stronger inflation and a bottoming out of manufacturing sector sentiment,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
A batch of U.S. indicators are scheduled to be released next week, such as Monday's core personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, Thursday's Chicago purchasing management index (PMI) and Friday's non-farm payrolls report.
Data earlier on Friday showed that Japan's consumer inflation was flat in the year to February as low energy costs and weak consumption put a lid on price growth, keeping pressure on the Bank of Japan to add more stimulus even after easing policy less than two months ago.
The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.1162 <EUR=>, below last week's one-month peak of $1.1342. It was on track to lose 0.9 percent in a week marred by attacks on Brussels for which Islamic State claimed responsibility.
The attacks added to pressure on sterling and sent it to its weakest trade-weighted basis in two years on fears that British voters would decide at a poll in June to leave the European Union.

Sterling was last down 0.3 percent at $1.4113 <GBP=>, on track for a 2.5 percent loss on the week.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1146 and 1.1187, before closing at 1.1175, down 0.04% on the session. Since surging to five-month highs last week, the euro has fallen more than 1.25% against the dollar. At session-lows, the euro dropped to its lowest level since the Fed rattled currency markets worldwide last week by unexpectedly reducing its interest rate forecast for the next three years. More broadly, the euro is down by roughly 1% over the last six weeks. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
A host of key policymakers from the Fed have struck a considerably more hawkish tone this week, days after the FOMC expressed concern that it may need to slow its outlook for future tightening against a backdrop of slowing global economic conditions. Earlier on Thursday, Federal Reserve of St. Louis president James Bullard hinted that the U.S. central bank's next rate hike could be looming if the U.S. economy demonstrates continued improvement over the next few weeks. While delivering a speech in New York, Bullard noted that the Fed could raise rates when it meets again in late-April and its next rate hike ""may not be far off"" if inflation continues to increase and unemployment declines from December levels. 
Bullard's comments come in the wake of a wave of hawkish statements by his colleagues at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) earlier this week. On Wednesday, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker also recommended that the FOMC raise rates as early as April, while suggesting as many as three rate hikes by the end of the year. Harker's statements followed comparable hawkish positions from San Francisco Fed president John Williams and Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart at the start of the week. 
They also contradict comments from Janet Yellen at a press conference last week when the Fed chair noted that the central bank should remain cautious with future rate hikes, amid heightened risks in global financial markets. At the meeting, the Fed held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate  at its current targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%. The rate continues to linger around 0.37%. 
Elsewhere, the U.S. Census Bureau said new durable goods orders fell 2.8% last month, one month after surging nearly 5% in January. In addition, new orders excluding transportation, which includes volatile aircraft orders, also dipped by 1.0% considerably below expectations for slight declines of 0.2%. The reductions were mostly a result of a stronger dollar, which weakened the demand for exports.
Further tightening by the Fed is also considered bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on more favorable rates. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.30% to an intraday high of 96.39, before closing at 96.17, up 0.11%. The index is riding a five-day winning streak, one of its highest in a year.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2016 10:29AM ET</span>","Dollar climbs on Fed rate-hike outlook, up for fifth day","By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed for a fifth straight day against a basket of major currencies, on track for its best streak in almost a year, as investors priced in the possibility of two U.S. interest-rate hikes this year from the Federal Reserve. 
St Louis Fed President James Bullard said Thursday in prepared remarks that another U.S. interest rate hike ""may not be far off."" 
Bullard's comments followed similar remarks Wednesday in which he said that a rate hike could come as soon as next month. That was in line with similarly hawkish comments from other U.S. policymakers earlier in the week.
""Hawkish Fed talk this week has caught a market that has largely underestimated the risk of U.S. rate rises, while lighter, pre-holiday trade seems to be enhancing the dollar's resurgence,"" said Western Union Business Solutions senior market analyst Joe Manimbo in a note to clients.
Some financial markets will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.
The dollar fell modestly in early North American trading following data showing a fall in durable goods orders and a slight uptick in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits, but remained higher on the day.
The greenback earlier hit an eight-day high of 96.364 (DXY) against a basket of major currencies, putting it in line for its longest winning streak since early April 2015.
The dollar index was last up 0.2 percent to 96.266. It has risen about 1.2 percent so far this week, its second-best weekly gain in four months. 
""Some of the Fed governors have been ... giving a little bit more of a hawkish stance than the market was prepared for, and so we're adjusting ever so slightly,"" said HSBC's head of currency research, David Bloom, in London. 
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Alvin Tan in London added that gains against sterling, which has fallen more than 2.5 percent this week as the odds of a British exit from the EU have narrowed, had also boosted the dollar. 
The pound  was flat on the day at $1.4112.
The euro hit an eight-day low of $1.1144 , having lost nearly 1 percent so far this week, with attacks in Brussels on Tuesday bruising sentiment.
It was last down 0.25 percent at $1.1155.

The attacks in Belgium were seen as exacerbating the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union, further undermining the euro as well as the pound.

681,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 23, 2016 05:55PM ET</span>","EUR/USD continues retreat from 5-month highs, amid hawkish Fed signals","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Wednesday extending losses from the previous three sessions, amid hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve that it could accelerate the pace of its first tightening cycle in the last decade over the coming months.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1159 and 1.1221, before settling at 1.1179, down 0.0042 or 0.37%. Following its fourth consecutive losing session, the euro closed under 1.12 versus the dollar for the first time in nearly a week. Last week, the euro soared to five-month highs against its American counterpart after the Fed left interest rates unchanged and lowered its outlook for future rate hikes.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) unexpectedly downgraded its rate outlook at last week's two-day March meeting, a number of key policymakers have reversed course in recent days by striking an aggressively hawkish tone. Addressing an audience of bond traders on Tuesday night at the Money Marketeers of New York University's conference on Growth and the Role of Economic Policies, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Patrick Harker Patrick Harker squarely aligned himself with his hawkish colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Citing continued improvement in the economy, Harker said the Fed should consider raising interest rates as early as its next meeting on April 28-29 and that he prefers at least three rate hikes before year's end. Harker, who became president of the Philadelphia Fed in mid-2015, is a non-voting member of the FOMC until the start of next year.
""I think we need to get on with it,"" Harker said. ""I am not a two (rate) rise person. This economy is really quite resilient to a lot of the headwinds so if that continues I would be supportive of another 25 basis point rise.""
Separately, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans said Tuesday that he expects two more rate hikes from the Fed this year. The FOMC's benchmark Federal Funds Rate continues to hover around 0.37%, after the U.S. central bank opted to leave  its targeted range unchanged last week between 0.25 and 0.50%. The Fed has held short-term interest rates steady at each of its last two meetings since it ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) in December. Even with three rate hikes over the next nine months, Harker still believes monetary policy would be ""incredibly accommodative"" around 1%.
Harker's statements followed comparable hawkish comments from San Francisco Fed president John Williams and Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart earlier this week. In recent months, dovish members of the Fed have argued that rates should continue to remain relatively low, as slowing economic conditions in China spill over into the global economy. Meanwhile, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard will deliver a speech on Thursday in New York, days after suggesting the Fed should study whether persistently lower interest rates could pin down long-term inflation.
Elsewhere, investors continued to monitor geopolitical developments following Tuesday's twin terror attack in Belgium, which killed 31 people and wounded approximately 270 others. In Europe, the major indices were relatively flat while the STOXX Europe 600 Travel & Leisure index closed down by 1.8%.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell six basis points to 1.88%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year lost one basis point to 0.20%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.55% to an intraday high of 96.24 in U.S. afternoon trading before settling at 96.06.

687,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>",Dollar hits one-week high on Fed rate hike comments ,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a one-week high against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, boosted by hawkish comments by U.S. Federal Reserve officials and safe-haven demand following Tuesday's deadly attacks in Brussels. 
Three-month sterling implied volatility  soared as investors prepared for turbulence exactly three months before a referendum of Britain's EU memberhip. The currency had been the biggest loser among major currencies on Tuesday, with the events in Brussels seen boosting the ""Brexit"" campaign.
The euro had also fallen after the attacks, which killed at least 31 and injured more than 200, and the currency was again weaker on Wednesday, hitting a one-week low of $1.1180 .
But that was partly due to broad strength in the dollar, which was boosted after comments supporting more U.S. interest rate hikes from the heads of the Philadelphia and Chicago Federal Reserves. 
""This week you've had U.S. inflation data tick up a bit, some hawkish comments, and then you've had that big paring back in dollar longs over the past year,"" Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said. ""That suggests to me it might be difficult for the dollar to carry on going down... The Fed is still the only central bank in rate hike mode in the G10."" 
""The euro yesterday did not exhibit safe-haven behavior after the awful attacks in Brussels,"" Foley said. ""That strengthens the idea that the euro's supposed safe-haven status over the past year was really a result of short-covering."" 
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the U.S. currency against six major rivals, rose about 0.3 percent to 95.920.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said the central bank should consider another hike as early as next month if the U.S. economy continues to improve, and that he would prefer at least three hikes before year-end.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans also said he expects two more rate increases this year, unless economic data comes in a lot stronger than expected or inflation picks up faster than anticipated. 
Evans does not have a vote on policy this year, but he is known as one of the U.S. central bank's most dovish policymakers. His remarks followed comments from three other Fed officials on Monday that all suggested rate increases might be on the way sooner rather than later. 

""Evans normally leans towards lower rates so it is interesting that he is happy to talk about two hikes this year, with markets only priced for one,"" Westpac senior currency strategist, Sean Callow, said in a note.

Risk sentiment took a hit after explosions tore through the departure hall of Brussels airport on Tuesday morning killing at least 26 people and injuring 35 others and a second blast struck a metro station in the capital shortly afterwards.
The blasts at the airport and metro station occurred four days after the arrest in Brussels of a suspected participant in November militant attacks in Paris that killed 130 people.
As well this week, San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said in separate news reports that a rate hike could come as early as next month. However, neither are voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee.
On Tuesday, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said as long as inflation is ""underrunning"" the Federal Reserve's 2% target, there is time to assess the global risks and hold off on raising rates again, as it is critical to get inflation up and even risk going above that level.
While it is true the economy is close to full employment, with unemployment at 4.9% and expected to fall further this year, ""we have room to see how this plays out,"" Evans said in a speech to the City Club of Chicago.
Evans, who is not a voter on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, said the FOMC's ""cautionary pause"" after the initial rate increase in December was the appropriate response to the ""bumpy"" start to 2016 and the risks to global economic and financial conditions.
The U.S. central bank surprised markets last week by cutting its rate hike projections more than expected, down from four to two in 2016, citing the potential impact from weaker global growth and financial market turmoil on the U.S. economy.

San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams told Market News International that April or June would be ""potential times for a rate hike"".
Their comments came a week after the Fed kept rates unchanged and cut in half the number of projected hikes to a mere two this year - a move seen by many as dovish.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2016 03:25PM ET</span>",Dollar rises as Fed officials put April in play for rate hike,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Monday after multiple Federal Reserve officials in separate appearances sounded a hawkish tone, suggesting U.S. interest rate increases were a ""live"" possibility at the central bank's upcoming meeting in April.
The U.S. central bank surprised investors last week by lowering its outlook for rate increases in 2016 and sounded a note of caution on the fragile global economy. That triggered heavy selling from traders betting on a stronger dollar.
On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said in prepared remarks that there has been ""sufficient momentum"" in the U.S. economy to justify a rate hike as early as next month. That bolstered the dollar, which hit session highs against the euro and Japanese yen after his comments.
""April is certainly sooner than many were expecting, considering it's not a meeting where we'll have a post-meeting press conference,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc in Washington.
""He (Lockhart) reiterated that every meeting is a 'live' meeting going forward and I think that overall somewhat hawkish tone to his comments is largely what's helping support the dollar this afternoon.""
The dollar rose 0.25 percent against the yen to 111.83 yen.
The euro  fell 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.1246.
Lockhart's remarks followed similar statements from San Francisco Fed President John Williams, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who also pointed to April as being viable for rate hikes.
Lockhart's testimony stood out because of his reputation as a centrist among the Fed presidents, Esiner noted.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the U.S. currency's strength against a basket of its peers, rose 0.2 percent to 95.298. 
The dollar's strength was also buoyed by a slide in sterling on rising 'Brexit' fears. The British pound sank more than half a percent on concerns that a split in the ruling Conservative Party is deepening ahead of June's referendum on European Union membership. 
Worries about Prime Minister David Cameron's ability to keep his Conservative party together and keep Britain in the European Union jumped after Iain Duncan Smith, a leading voice for the UK to exit the EU, resigned from the cabinet late on Friday.
The pound fell 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.4397 .

""Sterling does not normally react strongly to UK politics so this is probably due to Brexit,"" said Richard Benson, head of portfolio investment at currency managers Millennium Global.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar stayed on the defensive early on Monday, having extended its losses for a third week in the wake of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve.
Investors also gave sterling a wide berth after British Prime Minister David Cameron was forced into a hasty cabinet reshuffle on Saturday following the shock resignation of a senior minister.
The pound was marked as far down as $1.4430 , but has since returned to $1.4463, 0.1 percent lower on the day. 
The dollar index (DXY) was little changed at 95.063, not far from a five-month trough of 94.578 set on Friday. It had trimmed some of its losses as investors lightened bearish positions ahead of the weekend. 
Whether the market will resume selling remained to be seen with liquidity in Asia likely to be dampened by a holiday in Japan. Japanese markets reopen on Tuesday.
The greenback fetched 111.51 yen , still within reach of Friday's 17-month low of 110.67. The euro, which last week scaled a one-month peak of $1.1342, stood at $1.1271 .
Dollar bulls were hit hard last week after the Fed held interest rates steady and cut in half the number of projected quarter-point hikes to just two this year.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen also sounded doubtful that a recent firming in U.S. inflation would be sustained, suggesting the central bank is in no hurry to tighten policy.
Analysts at ANZ said removing two full hikes from the baseline projections was a significant move for the Fed at a time the U.S. economy still looked in pretty good shape. 
""Of course it could be a move that is fully justified if global economic conditions do continue to deteriorate,"" they wrote in a note to clients. 
""But one still has to wonder if the Fed is reverting back into old habits of providing markets with additional stimulus every time they throw a tantrum.""
The European Central Bank (ECB) was also looking to soothe market nerves. Its chief economist, Peter Praet, on Friday said rates have not reached their lower limit yet. 
He told a newspaper interview the ECB can cut rates again if the euro zone's economy fails to pick up and, under extreme circumstances, the bank might even consider printing money and giving it out directly to people.
Praet's comments came a week after ECB President Mario Draghi upset the market by saying he did not expect further rate cuts were needed after unveiling a fresh set of stimulus.

713,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 18, 2016 06:19PM ET</span>","EUR/USD retreats from 5-month highs, halting three-day winning streak","Investing.com -- EUR/USD retreated from 5-month highs on Friday, slowing the momentum a Fed-inspired rally from earlier this week after the U.S. central bank slashed its interest rate forecast at a closely-watched meeting.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1206 and 1.1343 before settling at 1.1269, down 0.0047 or 0.42% on the session. With the slight losses, the euro halted a three-day winning streak against the dollar when it surged more than 1%. More broadly, the euro has gained approximately 1.30% versus its American counterpart over the last month and nearly 4% since the start of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Foreign exchange traders could use a bit of a breather after a hectic stretch, which included interest rate decisions from four of the world's top central banks over the last 10 days. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sent the dollar spiraling to five-month lows by lowering its interest rate forecast through 2018. Citing increased global financial and economic risks and a soft inflation outlook, the Fed held the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate to 0.25-0.50% for the second consecutive meeting. More importantly, the U.S. central bank slashed its year-end projection for the Fed Funds Rate to 0.88%, signifying two rate hikes for the remainder of the year.
After raising short-term interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade, the FOMC said in its median forecasts that it could hike rates as much as four times in 2016. Last week, the European Central Bank approved a host of stimulus measures including pushing rates deeper into negative territory and increasing the scope of its comprehensive Quantitative Easing program. 
In a speech before the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy in Frankfurt, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard theorized that low interest rates may be causing persistently low inflation. While noting that the U.S. labor market is nearing full-employment and inflation net of the oil price shock is approaching the Fed's 2% target, Bullard argued that the FOMC's current policy position remains extreme. At its current level, the Fed Funds Rate is about 3% below the FOMC's long-run target, Bullard said, while the Fed's balance sheet exceeds its pre-crisis level by more than $3.5 trillion.
""Prudent policy suggests edging the policy rate and the balance sheet toward more normal levels,"" Bullard said.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.30% to an intraday high of 95.19, before falling back to 95.07 at the close. Since nearing 12-month highs at the start of the year, the index has slid almost 4%.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2016 08:12AM ET</span>","Dollar sell-off wanes, but on track for weekly losses on Fed outlook","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar index recovered from a five-month low on Friday, but was still on track for a third straight week of losses, as investors cut favorable bets after the Federal Reserve appeared cautious about raising rates at a steady pace this year.
The dollar was flat against the yen, having hit a 17-month low on Thursday, with traders worried that a sharp rise in the Japanese currency would elicit some kind of intervention from the Bank of Japan.
The dollar was trading at 111.41 yen , off a low of 110.67 plumbed on Thursday that was its weakest since October, 2014. The euro retreated from a five-week high of $1.1342  to $1.1280, but was still on track to gain 1.2 percent on the week. 
All this saw the dollar index (DXY) trade 0.25 percent higher at 95.001, having fallen to a five-month trough of 94.578 in Asian trade. It was set to end the week 1.2 percent lower.
""At these levels, the market is nervous about pushing dollar/yen too far lower just in case there is some response from the BOJ,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura.
The dollar has fallen sharply since the Federal Reserve lowered its expectations for interest rate increases this year at the midweek Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Treasury yields have slid since the policy meeting, fuelling the dollar's fall. [US/]
""Short-term speculators are leading the action. They appear to be selling the dollar and Japanese stocks in tandem, trying to probe for a bottom,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo.
""They are testing to see if the trough of the recent 110-115 yen range can hold,"" he said.
The dollar's post-FOMC weakness against the yen presents a headache for Japan. The country would like to see the yen remain relatively weak to support its exporters, but the market thinks Japan has to tread carefully lest it is accused of engineering competitive devaluations.
The dollar's weakness poses a challenge to the European Central Bank, too. The ECB eased extensively last week, hoping to weaken the euro somewhat and boost inflation.
But some banks are already revising their euro/dollar forecasts higher. Dutch bank ABN-Amro on Friday said it expected the euro to trade around $1.15 in the foreseeable future with a further adjustment in Fed rate hike expectations likely to see the euro touch $1.20.

""The longer-term picture has changed for the dollar,"" said Georgette Boele, analyst at ABN Amro. ""We think the multi-year bull trend of the dollar has come to an end. So if the range in euro/dollar is broken, it will likely be on the dollar weakness side, in our view.""

719,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>",Bitcoin finds room in small funds; large institutions still on sidelines,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin has found favor among smaller investors, thanks to the availability of funds designed to invest in it, but remains a niche among the larger investing community. 
Investors at some family offices, smaller mutual funds, and traders at hedge funds say bitcoin has helped returns and demonstrated a low correlation with other asset classes. 
Hopes that bitcoin would become a broadly used alternative to other currencies helped buoy its price to more than $1,000 in December 2013, when its market capitalization was $13 billion.
But the market cap has retreated since then, to about $6.4 billion as of Thursday.
Early enthusiasts for the crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. The risks of dealing in bitcoin were laid bare in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.
The currency's earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors.
Jeremy Millar, founder and managing partner at Ledger Partners in London, estimated that 50 to 90 percent of bitcoin's current $6.4 billion market cap is held by near-institutional money such as individuals at hedge funds and family offices. That has not changed over the last two years. 
He does not have an estimate for institutional investment holdings of bitcoin. But he said they are likely to be insignificant, compared with the smaller investors who have fewer restrictions about fund allocation.
""What is clear though is that over the last two years, bitcoin has emerged from its 'hacktivist' origins to a more institutionalized ecosystem which includes the participation of hedge funds, traders, and professional investors,"" said Millar.
BITCOIN IN PORTFOLIOS
Funds dedicated to investing in bitcoin are relatively small. The largest is the Pantera Bitcoin Fund, a $160 million hedge fund founded by Dan Morehead, formerly of Tiger Management, available to institutions and individuals who invest $50,000 or more.
According to a Pantera Bitcoin Fund brochure, the fund was launched in July 2013, a period when bitcoin  traded at around $65. On Thursday, it traded at $418.80, a gain of more than 500 percent from July 2013. The firm did not comment on fund performance or its investors.
The majority of the Pantera Fund's investors are family offices and high net worth individuals, said two people familiar with the fund. 
The Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, with assets of more than $60 million, is another vehicle for investors. GBTC is backed by bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group. 
It is the only publicly traded U.S. security in the over-the-counter market invested in bitcoin. Volume is thin, with a few thousand shares traded daily, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Antonis Polemitis, managing director at Ledra Capital in New York, a family office specializing in education and technology, said that on average, clients have allocated 1 to 3 percent of their portfolios to bitcoin.
""A lot of people will take that bet with 1 percent of their assets,"" he said. ""A 1 percent loss does not change anyone's life in any way. If it goes up 10 times, then you get to feel very smart.""
Some investment managers say having bitcoin in portfolios has helped performance.
ARK Invest, which manages four exchange-traded funds with $240 million in assets, holds GBTC in its $12 million Next Generation Internet ETF and the $7 million ARK Innovation ETF. 
Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at ARK Invest in New York, said since investing in September 2015, GBTC has contributed 67 basis points to the Next Generation Internet ETF's return and 62 basis points to the ARK Innovation ETF. 
For 2015, the Next Generation ETF posted a 15.29 percent return, while the Innovation ETF had 3.76 percent gains.

For Kingsbridge Wealth Management, a multifamily office in Las Vegas with $150 million in assets, GBTC has become a great diversifier because so far it has had a low correlation with other asset classes, said David Dunn, the firm's founder and chief investment officer. The firm has about $1.7 million invested in bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, Dunn said.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1206 and 1.1343, before settling at 1.1317, up 0.88% on the session. At session-highs, the euro soared to its strongest level against the dollar since mid-October. The developments may be unsettling for Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the European Central Bank, whose efforts to depress the euro as a means for boosting exports are increasing appearing futile. Since the ECB's Governing Council approved a wide range of easing measures last week, the euro has jumped nearly 3% against the dollar. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
The euro rose considerably versus the dollar on Thursday, one day after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. The Fed concluded its two-day March meeting without adjusting rates, amid heightened global financial and economic risks and moderate firming of inflation. It marked the second consecutive meeting the FOMC left short-term rates unchanged, after the U.S. central bank ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising rates 25 basis points in mid-December.
More importantly, the FOMC cut its rate outlook for the next 21 months lowering its 2016 forecast by 50 basis points to 0.88% and 50 basis points by the end of next year to 1.88%. Implicitly, the Fed's updated forecast suggests that the FOMC could raise rates only twice this year, down from previous estimates of four. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York held the Federal Funds Rate at 0.37%. The effective Fed Funds Rate traded in between 0.35 and 0.50%, as $67 billion in trades were exchanged. 
The dollar has fallen by more than 8% against the euro bloc currency over the last year when markets awaited lift-off from the Fed.
""In a world with highly-integrated capital markets, monetary policy actions in any country have affects, spillovers to other countries,"" Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference on Wednesday.""That's true of our monetary policy, and it's true of other countries' monetary policies. In part, that shows up through movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs to take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stance of monetary policy.""
""So, the fact that there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy. But it does not mean that monetary--US monetary policy is somehow constrained in a way that makes it impossible for our monetary policy to diverge from policies abroad,"" Yellen added. ""And at this point, it's natural that there should be some divergence in our monetary policies. Movements in exchange rates partly reflect that.""
Any rate hikes this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
Also on Thursday, the labor market remained steady as new claims ticked up by 7,000 last week to 265,000, remaining near record lows. At 268,000, the four-week average also stayed relatively low.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2016 02:00PM ET</span>","Brazil's real to hit record lows, or recover on impeachment: Reuters poll","By Silvio Cascione and Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's currency could strengthen back to mid-2015 levels or reach new record lows depending on the fate of President Dilma Rousseff, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as uncertainty mounted over a deepening political crisis.
The survey of 20 economists and strategists at leading financial firms in Brazil and abroad showed forecasts for the real at end-2016 , currently at 3.65 per dollar, ranging from 2.50 to 5.00 per dollar, depending on whether or not Rousseff manages to survive an impeachment process this year. 
The poll was conducted between March 14-17, with participants free to revisit their answers in light of new developments in the political crisis, such as the release of a taped conversation between Rousseff and Lula.
With Brazil's economy mired in its worst recession in decades, popular anger at Rousseff is mounting as an investigation into bribes and political kickbacks at state oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4) taints her inner circle.
Markets, looking to draw a line under a crisis that has now drawn millions of Brazilians to the streets in waves of historic protests, have rallied on hopes Rousseff will be impeached in coming months. 
Forecasts for end-2016 in that scenario mostly ranged between 3.20 and 4.20 per dollar, with the median at 3.50 per dollar, last struck in August, and one outlier at a 2014 high of 2.50 per dollar.
Brazil's 5-year credit default swap , a benchmark of risk premium, would also drop to an August low in that scenario, to 320 basis points from a current 402, according to the median forecast in the survey.
If Rousseff survives impeachment, helped by her mentor and now cabinet minister Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the exchange rate could weaken to a record low of 4.25 per dollar, according to the median forecast in the survey.
Most estimates ranged between 4.00 and 4.50 per dollar, but three outliers projected it at or very close to 5.00 per dollar.
The 5-year CDS, boosted by the lingering political deadlock, would reach 520 basis points, according to the median forecast.
The dispersion of forecasts even in a relatively small sample of estimates highlights the extreme uncertainty caused by the political crisis and the deep recession. 
Just two weeks ago, another Reuters poll projected the exchange rate at 4.25 per dollar in 12 months [BRL/POLL].
About two-thirds of respondents, 13, expect Rousseff to be removed from the presidency this year, while the rest say she is likely to stay. The proportion is similar to the chances calculated by research firms such as Eurasia and Arko Advice for Rousseff's impeachment, currently at 60-65 percent.
Despite the volatility, the central bank should start to reduce its market intervention, most poll respondents said.
Eleven of the 17 who responded to an extra question said the bank should start to reduce the stock of outstanding currency swaps over the next month, rolling over between 30 to 97 percent of the contracts it sold over the past years in an attempt to stabilize the market and moderate currency losses.
The central bank later announced it would indeed reduce the intensity of its daily currency swap rollovers.
Economists agreed to participate in the survey if their individual responses remained confidential. Fifteen of the participants were based in Brazil, and others were in Europe and in the United States.

728,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2016 10:12AM ET</span>","Forex - USD/JPY pulls back from 15-month low, sparking BoJ speculation","Investing.com - USD/JPY snapped back from 110.67, its lowest level since October 2014, sparking speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) had intervened in currency markets on Thursday, while a renowned expert called for a further strengthening of the Japanese currency.
The Federal Reserve lowered expectations for rate hikes this year bringing their forecast down to two increases in 2016 compared to the previous four and dovish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen explaining that ""global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks” and disregarding the recent uptick in inflation put downward pressure on the dollar.
In this light, the USD/JPY hit the intraday low of 110.67, but a rapid bounce back to its current 111.60 sparked some speculation that the BoJ may have “intervened” in markets in order to protect weakness in the yen.
These moves also came after Japan reported on Thursday that the adjusted trade balance for February came in at a surplus of ¥170 billion, narrower than the ¥240 billion seen. In a worrying sign for the world’s third-largest economy, exports fell 4.0% year-on-year, more than the 3.1% drop forecast by analysts.
Meanwhile, GBP/JPY was trading near session highs, as investors reacted to the decision by the Bank of England (BoE) to maintain monetary policy unchanged.
The yen was boosted after the BoJ made no change to monetary policy, in a widely anticipated decision, as it assesses the economic impact of its decision in January to deploy negative interest rates.
The move, which did little to weaken the yen, has been widely criticized and has contributed to the growing view that the BoJ’s loose monetary policy measures are losing their effectiveness.
The BoJ maintained its ¥80 trillion base money target and a 0.1% negative interest rate it applies to some reserves.
But the bank also flagged weakness in exports and output due to slowing growth in emerging economies, indicating that more stimulus may be needed in the future.The gloomy assessment of the global economy weighed on risk appetite, further boosting demand for the safety of the yen.
Much to the BoJ’s dismay, former Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara, known as Mr. Yen for his ability to influence exchange rates during the 1990s, not only called the rally in the Japanese currency to a more than one year-high against the dollar, but also expects another jump of about 6% to 105 in the second half of 2016.
“The yen’s appreciation isn’t the result of monetary policy or because Japan’s recovery is strong, it’s that the world economy has become very disorderly,” Sakakibara told Bloomberg in an interview.
This expert noted that the Chinese economy had no easy solution and pointed to the stagnation in global growth. “In that environment, the yen will necessarily strengthen,” he said, adding that “we’re in the first phase of that now.”"

733,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2016 06:02AM ET</span>",China's yuan hits strongest so far this year thanks to more dovish Fed ,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan  touched its strongest level so far in 2016 on Thursday, as the dollar eased all round after the Federal Reserve reduced its own expectations for the number of U.S. interest rate increases likely over the next nine months.
Hitting 6.4856 to the dollar, the strengthening of the yuan by around 0.5 percent Thursday was broadly in line with other major currencies gains against the U.S. currency (DXY).
""Also the yuan's appreciation is in the interest of the authorities,"" said a trader at an Asian bank in Shanghai.
After sharp declines in December and January which rattled global markets, the yuan has been on a firming trend recently as the dollar's retreat eased the impetus for capital outflows and the People's Bank of China maintained its defense of the yuan against speculators.

Nonetheless, analysts caution that China's economy still needs more monetary support, which could put renewed pressure on the currency in the months ahead.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar sank against other major currencies on Thursday, falling almost 2 percent to a three-week low against the yen, after a Federal Reserve meeting left markets convinced that U.S. interest rates would not rise anytime soon. 
The U.S. currency extended losses from Wednesday to trade at 111.675 yen as trading in European markets gathered pace, down 0.7 percent since trading closed in New York. 
It fell more than 1 percent to its lowest in more than 8 1/2 months against the Australian dollar  and half a percent to a one-month low against the euro at $1.1294. 
The yen is now backed by the biggest speculative positioning for further gains since the 2008 financial crisis drove it below 100 to the dollar. Some analysts say it may reach that level again. 
""We've only seen long positions like this twice in the last 15 years, and both times we've seen big rallies in the yen,"" said Neil Mellor, currency strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London. 
""I do think that monetary policy in Japan has come to its useful end. Rates-wise, there's a vacuum until we hit 109 yen, beyond that it's the 105s. I certainly would not exclude this ends with a fall below 100 yen per dollar.""
The Fed said it now expects two quarter-point rate cuts this year, not four. Moderate growth and strong job gains will allow it to raise rates this year, the policymakers said, but the U.S. economy faces risks from an uncertain global outlook.
That was enough to dispel any expectations rates would rise in either April or June. The dollar index fell to its lowest in a month in Asian trading, at 95.424. (DXY)
None of that disproves the argument that has supported the dollar for two years: that U.S. interest rates will rise more and remain higher than rates in Japan and the euro zone. 
The market's two biggest euro bears,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), are sticking to forecasts the dollar will reach parity with the single currency this year. Others still expect it to strengthen from here. 

""Ultimately... the Fed (should be) in a position to hike rates again,"" analysts from French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said. ""This should mean that the longer-term risks for USD should be on the upside as it becomes even more attractive investment currency.""

737,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2016 02:10AM ET</span>",What will Egypt's flexible exchange rate look like? ,"By Lin Noueihed
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's decision to make the exchange rate more flexible will return the central bank to the managed float in use before the 2011 uprising sent foreign investors and tourists packing, economists and bankers said.  
Egypt devalued the pound by 13 percent on Monday and said it would move to a more flexible exchange rate system, without giving details. 
Amid concern that the devaluation would fuel inflation, the central bank said it would do everything in its power to maintain price stability. Tellingly, it promised to maintain order, not stability, in the exchange rate. 
Economists and bankers expect the central bank to return to a managed float, allowing the pound to fluctuate daily within a limited range depending on market conditions. 
Though it supplied $1.5 billion to banks on Wednesday at a stronger rate of 8.78 pounds to clear a backlog of credit, they said the central bank would let the pound move in a weaker trajectory overall towards 9-9.50 per dollar.
""It is very likely that they will go back to a system they know, a system that prevailed prior to 2011,"" said Mohsin Khan, former Middle East and Central Asia director at the IMF and senior fellow at Atlantic Council. 
""I have always said (that system) was more managed than floating and I would say you (should) change the weighting and go more floating and less managed.""
WINNING BACK TRUST 
Egypt's pound was mostly pegged to the dollar until January 2003, when a free float was announced. 
The central bank created an interbank foreign exchange market, intervening heavily through two market-maker banks to keep the currency within comfortable parameters. Forex markets cleared daily, however, allowing flexibility that kept the market closer to balance.
But as foreign reserves tumbled after the 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year-rule, Egypt's currency came under pressure. 
The central bank allowed incremental devaluations, then began to ration dollars at formal auctions that it used to set the exchange rate. As imbalances grew, so did the black market. 
In 2015, it imposed caps on the deposit and withdrawal of forex, while letting the pound gradually weaken some 10 percent. 
But the caps exacerbated the forex shortage, undermined the confidence of foreign investors who could no longer repatriate their earnings and made it harder to clear imports at ports. 
When Tarek Amer became central bank governor in November, he set about gradually easing the caps and moving to narrow the trade deficit. 
But economists said Monday's devaluation was not enough to win back investors' trust and called for the central bank to end its forex auctions and return to the interbank system.
""It is critical that the new regime re-establish confidence in the convertibility of the Egyptian pound. There has to be a market where prices adjust to a point where the pound can be bought and sold on demand,"" said Simon Williams, central and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa chief economist at HSBC. 
""The central bank may intervene to limit volatility, but the market has to be allowed to set the market clearing rate."" 
TWO-PHASE FLOAT?
Egypt's foreign reserves rose in the decade leading up to the 2011 uprising, reaching a record $36 billion and allowing the central bank to comfortably manage the exchange rate. 
With reserves at $16.5 billion in February, barely enough for three months of imports, it no longer has that luxury.
For many bankers and economists, the question is whether the central bank can stay the course without a major forex injection.
Amer said last month he would not float the pound unless foreign reserves reached $25 billion. The central bank said on Monday it expected to reach that figure by year end, but did not say how.
Several bankers told Reuters that banks which received dollars at the exceptional $1.5 billion sale on Wednesday were requested to deposit the same amount back at the central bank, in a process Khan described as window-dressing. 
Trying to lure back foreign currency, Egypt has introduced instruments from diaspora bonds to forex hedging options on local treasuries. But it is not yet clear how such offerings will be received.
Hany Genena, head of research at Beltone Financial, was among the few economists who foresaw an impending float and predicted the long-awaited devaluation would take place this week.
He said the central bank would probably move to a managed float in two phases. First, it would clear the backlog among importers who had letters of credit at the old exchange rate and were now turning to the black market for cover. 
Then it would return to the interbank system and allow the rate to fluctuate daily. 
""So he's taking pressure off the parallel market and then he will gauge the inflows and then he can float freely with a 10 or 20 piaster change every day and no one is going to speculate against that,"" Genena said.

""If they get more money into the reserves they will relax more.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's jobless rate took a surprising drop in February even as employment all but stalled, a mixed bag that left the outlook clouded but did seem to lessen the chance of a cut in interest rates in the near term.
Thursday's report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed unemployment fell to 5.8 percent in February, when analysts had expected it to stay at 6.0 percent.
That owed much to a fall in the number of people looking for work since actual employment underwhelmed with an increase of just 300 in the month. Full-time employment rose a solid 15,900, only to be almost completely offset by a drop in part-time jobs.
Still, the monthly jobs numbers are notoriously volatile and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) tends to focus on shifts in the unemployment rate to gauge the health of the labor market.
""They are waiting for greater clarity about what's happening in the economy and what the unemployment rate is telling them is the positives are outweighing the negatives,"" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank.
""We are getting this trend decline (in unemployment), so no need for further rates' assistance.""
Financial markets seemed to agree as investors lifted the local dollar to an eight-month high around $0.7620 <AUD=D4>.
Interbank futures <0#YIB:> continue to imply around a 50-50 chance of a rate cut by August, in part because policy steps by other major central banks were pushing the local dollar higher in a way that could prove a brake on exports.
Just on Wednesday the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled a slowdown in the planned pace of its policy tightening, sending the U.S. dollar reeling.
Asked about the Fed's move, RBA Assistant Governor Guy Debelle said practically every central bank in the world was keen to see a falling currency.
""We would like a lower Australian dollar. But we can't all have depreciating currencies,"" Debelle said, conceding it would be hard to engineer a decline in the Aussie.
WORKERS WANTED
The labor market has been one of the star performers in an Australian economy grappling with the demise of a decade-long boom in mining investment.
Key has been growth in a range of service sectors which have been generating more than 300,000 new jobs a year.
An aging population has boosted health care, while a boom in visitors from China and the rest of Asia lifted tourism and education. Home building is also hitting records and generating jobs in architectural and engineering services.
Measures of demand for labor were also flashing green. A well-regarded survey of industrial trends released on Thursday showed strength in home building had boosted conditions to their best in two decades.
The survey from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Westpac Bank also found the outlook for the labor market at its strongest since the mid-2000s.
""Employment intentions have turned positive and firms expect to grow their workforce over the next three months,"" said Westpac senior economist, Andrew Hanlan.
""The survey correctly foreshadowed the strengthening in economy-wide jobs growth over the past year. It points to further solid gains in 2016.""

741,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 16, 2016 07:56PM ET</span>","EUR/USD surges to 1-month high, as Fed cuts interest rate forecast","Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged to its highest level in a month, as the dollar fell precipitously on Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve lowered its interest rate forecast at a closely-watched meeting.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1058 and 1.1241 in Wednesday's session before settling at 1.1217, up 0.99% on the session. Since opening the month below 1.09, the euro has jumped by more than 0.8% on three separate occasions, soaring by more than 3% in a span of two weeks. After crashing by more than 10% against the dollar in 2015, the euro has rallied 3.3% versus its American counterpart since the start of the new year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1335, the high from Feb. 12.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the Federal Funds Rate  at a target range between 0.25% and 0.50%, leaving its benchmark interest unchanged for the second consecutive month. Citing increased global and economic and financial risks and a modest uptick in inflation, Fed chair Janet Yellen emphasized that conditions in the economy will likely warrant gradual interest rate hikes for the remainder of the year. Notably, the FOMC lowered its projections for future rate increases by 50 basis points for each of the next two years. The Fed now expects to raise interest rates twice in 2016, down considerably from December forecasts of four potential interest rate hikes this year.
""In addition, proceeding cautiously in removing policy accommodation at this time will allow us to verify that the labor market is continuing to strengthen despite the risks from abroad,"" Yellen said on Wednesday. ""Such caution is appropriate given that short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy has greater scope to respond to upside than to downside changes in the outlook.""
Since the FOMC last met in January, Yellen noted that the economy has expanded at a moderate pace while she has noticed additional strength in the labor market. Over the last two months, the unemployment rate has remained under 5.0% while the labor market has averaged monthly job gains of 230,000 dating back to December.
While Yellen said that inflation has moved higher in recent months, it still remains far below the FOMC's targeted objective of 2%. The Fed's cautious stance comes days after the European Central Bank unveiled a comprehensive set of easing measures last week in a last-ditched attempt to bolster economic growth and stave off deflation throughout the euro zone.
At a meeting last week in Frankfurt, the ECB's Governing Council reduced its deposit rate by 0.1 to Minus-0.4% and cut its refinance rate by 0.05% to a new record-low of zero. Then, on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan held its benchmark interest rate steady at negative-0.1%.
Yellen said on Wednesday that the FOMC is not actively discussing the prospect of adopting a negative rate policy.
""We are certainly not actively considering negative rates,"" Yellen said. ""We are looking at the experience in other countries, which I would judge seem to have mixed effects."" ""If we found ourselves in the unlikely situation where we needed to add accommodation, we have a range of tools,"" Yellen added.
""We know from the things we did in the past, we have a number of options in respect with the maturity of our portfolio and with respect to asset purchases."" Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell six basis points on Wednesday to 1.91%. Over the last month, government bond yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries are up 14 basis points."

Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Guy Debelle said on Thursday the first part of the two-part code would be released in late May and would include ""mechanisms"" to encourage all participants to adhere to the principles.
""The concrete details of the adherence mechanisms remain a work in process,"" said Debelle, who heads up the work on the code for the Bank of International Settlements.
""We will have more to say on this in New York in May. At this stage, our thinking is that there is unlikely to be a single adherence mechanism but rather a suite of mechanisms.""
The code will set out principles of good practice in the wholesale foreign exchange market that provide guidance on what sort of practices are acceptable or not.
""One of the guiding principles underpinning our work is that the code should promote a robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent market,"" said Debelle.
""This should help to address the lack of trust as well as promote the effective functioning of the wholesale FX market.""
The full code will be released following the Global Foreign Exchange Committee meeting in London in May 2017.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2016 04:20AM ET</span>",BOJ's policy suspense leaves FX traders in limbo,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Forex traders complain that market liquidity in the dollar/yen, the world's second-most traded currency pair, falls to abysmal levels on days when the Bank of Japan announces its policy decisions, and they are blaming the central bank for that.
The BOJ has no pre-set schedule for its monetary policy announcements, unlike other major central banks. It also announces its decision as soon as one is reached. Since BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda took the helm in 2013, policy announcements have been made between 11:41 a.m. (0241 GMT) and 1:40 p.m. (0440 GMT). As a result, on March 15, for over an hour before the BOJ announced its decision at 12:35 p.m., trading became razor-thin.
""From around 11:30 a.m., people simply stopped providing liquidity, and we saw crazy bid/offer spreads,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""I would wish the BOJ simply makes its announcement at a certain set time.""
In the dollar/yen, the gap between the best offers and the best bids is normally around 1 pip, or 0.01 yen. But on March 15 the spread began widening from around 11:30 a.m., and increased to more than 20 pips. As liquidity thins, even a small amount of trading causes sizable price swings. That makes the market harder to read, and amplifies any potential losses from a wrong bet. On such days, many dollar/yen traders just refrain from trading for as long as it takes before the BOJ's decision.
By contrast, such protracted periods of illiquidity are not seen ahead of policy announcements by other major central banks. Last week in Europe, the bid/offer spread of the euro/dollar pair rose only slightly, and just less than 30 seconds before the European Central Bank's policy announcement.

753,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2016 05:45PM ET</span>","EUR/USD flat, as traders exercise caution ahead of Fed rate decision","Investing.com -- EUR/USD inched up on Tuesday in a quiet day of trading, as foreign exchange traders await the release of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy statement for potential clues on the pace of tightening the U.S. central bank will embark on for the remainder of the year.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1072 and 1.1125, before settling at 1.1107, up 0.0006 or 0.06% on the session. The euro closed above 1.11 against the dollar for the fourth consecutive session. Since opening 2016 slightly above 1.085, the euro is up approximately 2.3% against its American counterpart. More immediately, EUR/USD has rallied by more than 1% over the last month.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1335, the high from Feb. 12.
On Wednesday, the Fed is widely expected to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current range between 0.25 to 0.50% when it issues its latest monetary policy statement. Since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last met in January, the U.S. economy has shown signs of improvement amid firming inflation and a surge in nonfarm payrolls. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge on inflation, soared by 1.7% in January on an annual basis, its strongest annual gain in more than a year. Core PCE Inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has still remained below the Fed's targeted goal of 2% in every month over the last three years. 
Although the FOMC signaled in December that it could raise interest rates as much as four times this year, dovish members of the Fed are hesitant to tighten monetary policy as a host of major central banks throughout the world hold rates below zero in a last-ditch attempt to stimulate economic activity. The U.S. central bank may now wait until June or even September before approving its next rate hike, according to current market expectations.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The Fed's latest rate decision will come days after the European Central Bank approved a comprehensive set of easing measures last week in an effort to bolster flagging economic growth and stave off deflation throughout the euro zone. At the closely-watched meeting, the ECB's Governing Council reduced its deposit by 0.1 to Minus-0.4% and cut its refinance rate by 0.05% to a new record-low of zero. At the same time, the ECB increased the size of its asset-purchasing program by €20 billion to €80 billion a month and extended the initiative by several months through March, 2017.
Also on Tuesday, the dollar fell mildly against the yen after the Bank of Japan kept short-term interest rates at their current level. In a 7-2 vote, the BOJ held its benchmark rate steady at Minus-0.1%, while also leaving its target for its monetary base unchanged. USD/JPY settled on Tuesday at 113.16, down 0.59% on the session.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained one basis point to 1.97%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year added four basis points to 0.32%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 96.91, before falling back to 96.66 at the close. The index still remains near one-month lows.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2016 02:31PM ET</span>",Britain's fraud office drops forex market investigation,"By Huw Jones and Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's fraud watchdog has ended an investigation into possible foreign exchange market rigging, saying it did not have enough evidence to secure convictions, in a further setback to its efforts to prosecute wrongdoers in financial markets.
Some of the world's biggest banks have been fined billions of dollars for trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates after a global probe into the $5 trillion a day market.
So far no individual traders have not been prosecuted.
The investigation by the Serious Fraud Office began in July 2014 after material was passed to it by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority. The SFO was one of several authorities around the world to investigate alleged forex market manipulation. An inquiry by the U.S. Department of Justice is continuing.
The investigation by the Serious Fraud Office began in July 2014 after material was passed to it by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority. The SFO was conducting one of several probes around the world into the alleged forex market manipulation.
The SFO said on Tuesday that based on the information and material obtained, there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.
The SFO, which investigates and prosecutes major and multi-national fraud, bribery and corruption, said its decision followed an independent investigation lasting more than one and a half years and involving over half a million documents.
It said it continued to liaise with the DOJ over its ongoing investigation.
The SFO's decision follows the acquittal earlier this year in a trial brought by the SFO of six former brokers accused of conspiring with Tom Hayes to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate. 
Hayes was found guilty last August of conspiring to rig Libor and was jailed.
""Coming hot on the heels of the recent Libor verdict this will be embarrassing for the SFO,"" Alison McHaffie, a regulatory partner with law firm CMS, said.
""However it does show the difficult job the SFO has in demonstrating criminal activity by individuals for this type of market misconduct.""
Authorities were first alerted to alleged collusion between currency traders setting benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 pm daily ""London fixing"" in mid-2013.
The subsequent investigations by regulators around the world, principally in the United States and Britain, led to dozens of traders being suspended or fired, new codes of conduct drawn up and some of the world's biggest banks fined more than $10 billion collectively.
The probes centred largely on millions of electronic chatroom communications between groups of FX traders at banks who routinely shared intelligence on orders they were about to place for clients.
Many of the traders who were fired during the investigation are now suing their former employers for unfair dismissal. Perry Stimpson won his case against Citi in London last November.
Ben Rose, a partner at law firm Hickman and Rose, said the SFO's decision suggested it was pulling back from prosecuting cases linked to financial benchmarks. 
""This decision follows the sweeping acquittals of six brokers in the recent Libor trial. It suggests that the SFO is losing its appetite for risk and that the Hayes verdict may be the high water mark for these prosecutions.""

757,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2016 09:03AM ET</span>",Forex - Pound weakens on bearish sentiment from BoE to Brexit,"Investing.com – The pound showed weakness against major currency counterparts on Tuesday amidst a slew of news that negatively affected sentiment and convinced investors to undo positions ahead of the Bank of England (BOE) and Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy decisions.
Early on Tuesday, an OBR poll showed that a majority of Britons that intended to vote in the June 23 referendum on European Union (EU) membership would prefer to leave the group. The so-called Brexit worries businesses about the implied effect on trade with Europe and the possible hit to the U.K. economy which some experts fear could increase the chances for a recession.
With regard to the British economy, economists cut the growth forecast for this year to 2%, from 2.2%, according to a Bloomberg survey published on Tuesday.
Also weighing on the pound, the same survey showed that the chances for the BoE to lower interest rates in 2016 had grown to 23%, up from the February survey that had placed the odds at only 10%.
Expert opinion also weighed in against sterling on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recommended taking long positions in the dollar ahead of the Fed meeting on Wednesday on the possibility of the U.S. central bank sounding more hawkish than expected and suggested that shorting cable offered the best risk-reward ratio ahead of the BoE meeting on Thursday.
In this light, the pound traded lower against major currency rivals with GBP/USD dropping 0.87% to 1.4176 at 12:59GMT or 8:59AM ET, GBP/JPY falling 1.81% to 159.83 and EUR/GBP trading up 0.95% to 0.7893."

761,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2016 05:35AM ET</span>",Yen gains as BoJ stays neutral on further rate cuts,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen rose more than half a percent against the dollar on Tuesday, helped by a weakening of oil prices which sent investors in search of traditional safe havens and a neutral message from the Bank of Japan on rates. 
Six weeks after shocking markets by cutting rates to negative, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would take time to look at the impact, but it could move again before the cut had worked its way fully into the economy.
While the yen has gained further since the cut in January, it drew some support from the absence of an explicit threat to reduce rates again. Of as much impact was the fall in oil prices and a resulting downbeat start for European stock markets. 
""The bias is just in favor of a stronger yen,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of global market research at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. 
""On the days when we are 'risk on', the yen holds strong and on days like today, it gains. Certainly Kuroda was keen to leave open the potential for further moves but it was probably too much to expect him to be explicit at this stage."" 
The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 113.05 yen , while the euro slipped about 0.6 percent to 125.62 yen (EURJPY=). The dollar rose as high as 121.70 yen on Jan. 29, immediately after the BOJ's announcement, but has since shed more than 6 percent. 
Next up is the U.S. Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day meeting on Tuesday.
A firming of price measures and solid readings from other U.S. data have rekindled market expectations of further tightening this year, and any sign that could still happen in the first half would be liable to aid the dollar, Halpenny said.
Retail sales data on Tuesday will provide another indication of the strength of the U.S. economy.
""We stay of the view that further improving U.S. growth conditions keep the Fed in a position to tighten monetary policy further this year,"" analysts from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in note. 
""From that angle we believe that dollar dips should still be bought, for instance against the Swiss franc."" 
The euro edged up slightly to $1.1112 , a cent off last week's one-month high of $1.1218.

The currency pair traded between 1.1078 and 1.1153 in Monday's session, before settling at 1.1103, down 0.0062 and 0.45% on the day. Last Thursday, the euro surged more than 1.6% against the dollar after the European Central Bank approved a wide range of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering economic growth throughout the euro zone. The euro has closed above 1.11 against its American counterpart in each of the last three sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0709, the low from January 5 and was met with resistance at 1.1378, the high from Feb. 11.
On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged several weeks after the Japanese central bank roiled global markets by unexpectedly adopting a negative interest rate policy for the first time in history. At the January meeting, the BOJ lowered lowered the rate it charges to commercial banks that park excess reserves at the central bank to negative 0.1% in a move aimed at helping its economy stave off threats of deflation. The BOJ is ostensibly hoping to keep the yield curve as low as possible in order to assist the government with financing issues by making public sector debt more affordable.
A day later, the Federal Reserve will issue its latest monetary policy statement following the completion of its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for the month of March. While the Fed is also expected to leave short-term interest rates steady, the U.S. central bank could provide further clues on its pace of future rate hikes in its first tightening cycle in a decade. The FOMC held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a target range between 0.25 and 0.50% in January, one month after abandoning a seven-year zero interest rate policy.
The U.S. economy has shown signs of improvement since the FOMC's last meeting. In February, non-farm payrolls surged by 242,000, considerably above consensus estimates of gains of 190,000. A month earlier, the Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge on inflation, soared by 1.7% on an annual basis, its strongest annual gain in more than a year. Economists, however, remain concerned by sluggish wage gains after average hourly earnings fell by 0.1% last month.
The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch reported on Monday that there is a 96.1% chance the FOMC will leave rates unchanged at the March meeting. By comparison, the CME Group said a month ago there was an 81.5% probability that the FOMC would hold rates steady.
On Thursday, the Bank of England will end a week of central bank meetings with its latest interest rate decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.35% to an intraday high of 96.74 before closing at 96.60 . The index still remains near one-month lows from late last week.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell two basis points to 1.96%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year added one basis point to 0.28%."

By 1900 GMT, the ruble was up 0.07 percent at 69.83 against the dollar and 0.6 percent at 77.50 versus the euro.
The Russian currency rose 3 percent against the dollar last week as Brent crude prices added more than 4 percent, lifting investors' risk appetite.
Market attention will soon turn to the Russian central bank's monetary policy meeting on Friday.
While the majority of economists polled by Reuters said early this month they expected the bank to leave rates on hold, slowing inflation and a strengthening rouble mean some think a rate cut could be on the cards.
Russian share indexes were mixed early on Monday, reflecting moves in the rouble.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2016 12:30PM ET</span>","Egypt devalues pound, announces more flexible exchange rate policy ","By Asma Alsharif, Lin Noueihed and Ehab Farouk
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank devalued the pound on Monday and said it would move to a more flexible exchange rate regime, in an effort to rebalance markets and ease a foreign exchange shortage that had stifled business activity and hit confidence.
Egypt devalued the pound to 8.85 per dollar from 7.73 and simultaneously pumped nearly $200 million into the dollar-starved banking system in a surprise sale.
""The Central Bank of Egypt has decided to follow a more flexible policy with regard to the exchange rate, aiming to resolve distortions in the exchange rate system and restore the circulation of foreign currency inside the banking system in an orderly way,"" the bank said in an extensive statement.
It did not explain how the new approach would work, but it vowed to rebuild forex reserves to $25 billion by the end of the year from $16.5 billion now and ""maintain order in the currency market and stability in price levels in the medium term.""
Cairo's main stock index rose 6.7 percent, its biggest jump since Islamist President Mohamed Mursi was toppled in mid-2013. Trading volume was the heaviest since at least 2009.
Economists welcomed a move many said was overdue and would encourage foreign investment in Egyptian stocks and government bonds, from which foreign money has fled in recent years.
""It's a welcome, but long overdue shift in policy stance - Egypt could have saved billions in reserves if it had done this 18 months ago,"" said Simon Williams, chief economist for Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa at HSBC. 
""The question now is will they follow through - if the pound needs to weaken further, will they let it? Are the authorities ready to tolerate the rise in inflation this will inevitably bring?"" 
Egypt, heavily dependent on imports, has been short of foreign currency since a 2011 uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule, scaring off foreign investors and tourists. Since then, reserves have more than halved, weighing on the pound.
But with tens of millions living in poverty, the central bank was reluctant to devalue for fear of sparking inflation. Urban consumer inflation reached an annual 9.1 percent in February and Egypt's government has been at pains to hold down basic food prices - a politically explosive issue.
The devaluation helped close the gap between the official exchange rate and the black market level, which had depreciated to unprecedented levels near 10 to the dollar in recent weeks. Two black market traders said they would now sell dollars at about 9 pounds. 
In the three-month non-deliverable forward (NDF) market , the pound fell almost 13 percent to 9.75 per dollar as expectations of depreciation receded.
""On the micro level, it is not good for me because I have liabilities in dollars, but for the country it will be good for foreign direct investments,"" said a financial manager at an investment firm. 
PAVING THE WAY
Central bank Governor Tarek Amer, who took over in November, had taken several steps to prepare for devaluation and a more flexible approach.
He initially appreciated the currency by 20 piasters, a move some economists said at the time was aimed at breaking the downward cycle of bets against the pound.
Amer then introduced measures to regulate trade, in an effort to cut imports by 25 percent this year and reduce demand for foreign currency. Along with that policy, devaluation should also boost the competitiveness of Egyptian exports abroad. 
Amer also eased the restrictions on the deposit and withdrawal of foreign currency imposed by his predecessor in February 2015 to preserve scarce dollars for essential imports.
The restrictions were hugely unpopular with businesses, since they exacerbated the dollar shortage. That made it hard for companies to clear imports, which piled up at ports, while factory output was disrupted by delays in importing components. 
To attract money from abroad, Egypt introduced new dollar- and euro-denominated certificates of deposit for Egyptian expatriates. State banks also introduced a currency hedging option to attract foreign investors to Egyptian treasuries. 
As markets digested Monday's devaluation, Egypt's two largest state-owned banks said they would also offer pound-denominated investment certificates at 15 percent yields in exchange for hard currency.
The devaluation raised expectations of a bigger hike in interest rates at the central bank's next Monetary Policy Committee meeting, on Thursday, to stabilize the exchange rate and avert dollarization. 
Those views were bolstered by a jump in yields on five- and 10-year treasury bonds on Monday afternoon.

""We have just started on the sustainability road – fiscal and monetary discipline dictated by a free-floating currency,"" Hany Genena, head of research at Beltone Financial said in a note. ""Egypt did it and the... governor and all parties involved deserve applause.""

774,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2016 07:42AM ET</span>",Dollar ticks up against euro with Fed meeting in focus,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - Currency markets were off to a relatively quiet start on Monday, stabilizing after last week's wild swings, as investors geared up for Japanese and U.S. central bank policy meetings that could offer them fresh direction.
There are also interest rate decisions from the Swiss, Australian and Norwegian central banks this week along with the Bank of England. All these meetings are likely to provide a test of central banks' ability to successfully manage market expectations, analysts said.
Traders said the euro was little moved by German election results over the weekend, where Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative CDU party received a drubbing. 
Nevertheless, the low-yielding euro shed 0.3 percent to trade at $1.1110 , hurt in part by rising stock markets, but not far from a one-month high of $1.1218 set last Thursday when it soared after the European Central Bank eased extensively while also signaling that it may limit future interest rate cuts.
The dollar eased against the yen to 113.70 yen  having gained 0.6 percent on Friday. Improved risk appetite had lifted the greenback from a low of 112.225 to as high as 114.45 versus the safe-haven yen last week.
For dollar bulls, the focus was on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. While signs U.S. inflation is picking up will be seen as a positive, the Fed will be wary of sounding too hawkish, with Chair Janet Yellen likely to convey a fairly neutral tone. 
""The meeting could see an acknowledgement of slightly improved conditions ... the Fed wants to make sure these developments have taken hold before acting. Such a dovish message could see downward pressure on the dollar,"" said Josh O'Byrne, currency strategist at Citi.
The Bank of Japan, fresh from adopting negative interest rates in January, is expected to stand pat when its two-day meeting ends on Tuesday.
The market will sift through the BOJ's policy statements for any hints that it may be losing confidence in negative rates after the ECB suggested it will have to be cautious on cutting ever deeper. 
""Despite the large scale ECB easing last week, our economists are not looking for the BOJ to follow suit, certainly not in terms of a lower negative rate,"" said Viraj Patel, currency strategist at ING.
""If anything, the BOJ may look to ease some of the burden on the financial sector and this may come in the form of a small expansion of corporate bond/ETF purchases or increased exemptions of funds subject to the new negative rate policy.""

The BOJ's surprise decision to take rates below zero on Jan. 29 did little to weaken the yen, which eventually soared to a 16-month high against the dollar last month.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1080 and 1.1210, before settling at 1.1148, down 0.26% on the session. On Thursday, the euro surged more than 1.6% against the dollar, following hawkish comments from ECB president Mario Draghi, enjoying one of their strongest one-day moves in three months. EUR/USD has closed over 1.11 in each of the last two sessions. Before Thursday's surge, the pair last eclipsed the threshold on February 22.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0709, the low from January 5 and was met with resistance at 1.1378, the high from Feb. 11.
The sharp sell-off came one day after the ECB's Governing Council approved a comprehensive stimulus package at Thursday's meeting in a last-ditched attempt to stave off threats of deflation and bolster investor sentiment. The ECB lowered its marginal lending rate by 0.05 to 0.25% and cut its main refinance rate by 0.05% to a new record-low of zero. The Governing Council also pushed its deposit rate deeper into negative territory, by cutting it 0.1 to Minus-0.4%.
At the same time, the central bank increased the size of monthly purchases with its bond-buying program by €20 billion to 80 billion a month and extended the program by several months through March, 2017. The ECB launched the comprehensive Quantitative Easing program last March in order to increase the amount of money supply available for banks to lend money to businesses and individuals. In addition, the ECB introduced a new series of Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) on Thursday and announced that it will be purchasing non-financial corporate debt issued by companies established in the euro zone.
Also on Friday, data released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that net long positions in the U.S. dollar declined from $7.45 billion to $6.88 billion last week. It marked the fourth consecutive week that net longs in the greenback dipped under $10 billion.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose mildly by 0.18% to 96.23. Since nearing 12-month highs in early-February, the dollar has slumped more than 3.4%.
Investors turn their attention to an interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve next Wednesday, following the completion of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) two-day March meeting. While the FOMC is widely expected to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rates unchanged, the U.S. central bank could provide guidance on its pace of tightening over the next several months. In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising the Fed Funds Rate 25 basis points to a target range between 0.25 and 0.50%.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose by five basis points to 1.98%. Since falling below 1.75% in early-February, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries have increased have moved higher in four consecutive weeks, representing their longest winning streak since May, 2013."
782,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2016 04:49PM ET</span>",U.S. dollar longs slip; yen longs at 8-year high-CFTC,"(Reuters) - Speculators pared bullish bets on the U.S. dollar, with net longs falling below $10 billion for a fourth straight week, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
The value of the dollar's net long position declined to $6.88 billion in the week ended March 8, from $7.45 billion the previous week.
The U.S. February jobs report last week showed a drop in wages overshadowed strong jobs growth, feeding views the Federal Reserve was in no hurry to hike interest rates. The dollar weakened, and its poor performance continued early this week as concerns about weak Chinese data spurred safe-haven demand for the yen and Swiss franc.
So far in March, the dollar index was down 2 percent, on track for its weakest monthly performance since last April.
In other currencies, investors pushed net long positions on the yen to their highest in eight years. Net long contracts on the yen rose to 64,333 this week, from 59,625 the week before.
Fears about a British exit from the EU and persistent concerns about the global economy have boosted the yen, a safe-haven currency that so far this year has gained 5.4 percent against the dollar.
Net shorts on the euro rose to the largest since early February. This week, net euro shorts rose to 71,907 contracts from 68,541 previously.
The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>",Euro dips after surge post-ECB,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell back on Friday after a shocking series of moves generated by Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting ended with its biggest gain in a month, undermining the case of those still calling for a fall to parity with the dollar.
The ECB took bold easing steps, including an expansion in asset buying and a deeper cut to already negative deposit rates that added up to far more than the market had expected and that should have weakened the euro. 
But President Mario Draghi's comment that he expected the bank might not have to cut rates further fed concerns that officials in Europe and Japan are running out of ideas on how to weaken their currencies and raise inflation.
After a surge to more than $1.12 on Thursday, the euro eased almost 1 percent to $1.1085 in morning trade in Europe.
""A few months ago, if you had expected such measures were going to be deployed, you would have thought the euro would fall 3 percent,"" said Gian Marco Salcioli, head of FX sales at Italy's  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) Banca IMI (LON:IMI) in Milan.
""Going forward, this is not risk positive, and it is probably euro supportive but we need to see the price action of the next few days."" 
The 4-cent spread between the euro's highs and lows on Thursday equaled any of the euro's most volatile days over the past five years and were similar to moves after two of the past year's key ECB meetings - in December and last March.
After Japan's failure to cap the yen with a move to negative interest rates last month, the euro's gain weakens the argument made by many banks over the past year that higher U.S. interest rates will steadily strengthen the dollar against the euro and yen.
But there were still some notes of caution from many in the market on Friday. Richard Cochinos, an analyst with the market's biggest banking player, Citi, said its numbers showed that hedge funds had sold the euro on Thursday and longer-term ""real money"" institutional investors had been flat on the day. 
""Major players sat on the sidelines, both leading up to the ECB announcement and post and this may be a good place to be right at the moment,"" said Tobias Davis, head of corporate FX sales at Western Union in London. 
""It is the oil move that has created most of today's opportunities.""
A more than 2 percent rise in U.S. and Brent crude boosted both stock markets and a range of higher-yielding currencies including the Canadian and Australian dollars   and Norwegian crown (EURNOK=) at the expense of the euro. 
The dollar index (DXY), having fallen sharply on the euro's broad strength, recovered around half a percent from a one-month low of 95.939 hit in U.S. trading.
The focus will now shift to a March 14-15 Bank of Japan policy meeting. The BOJ is widely expected to stand pat on monetary policy after adopting negative rates in January, but some speculate it could lower rates further.
""I don't think the BOJ will ease next week. That said, the ECB's easing was a full spectrum one, and the market will approach the BOJ meeting thinking anything could be possible,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
""As for the ECB's easing, it is after all a 'risk on' factor. Its effects could be felt gradually and curb yen strength.""

The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 113.74 yen <JPY=>, having dipped to 112.75 in Asian time. It is still within striking distance of a 16-month low below 111 yen hit last month in response to concerns over banks and the pace of global growth.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0823 and 1.1217, before settling at 1.1178, up 1.75% on the session. At session lows, the euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar in six weeks. The euro, however, quickly rebounded following Draghi's comments, reaching its highest point since mid-February.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0709, the low from January 5 and was met with resistance at 1.1378, the high from Feb. 11.
As expected, the European Central Bank's Governing Council approved a comprehensive set of easing initiatives on Thursday aimed at boosting economic growth throughout the euro zone and staving off deflation. The Governing Council used nearly all of the tools at its disposal to stimulate the economy by lowering three key rates at the meeting and extending the breadth and depth of its comprehensive Quantitative Easing program.
As part of its updated policy, the ECB lowered its deposit rate deeper into negative territory by reducing it by 0.1 to Minus-0.4%. The Governing Council also cut the marginal lending rate by 0.05 to 0.25% and the refinance rate by 0.05% to zero. At the same time, the central bank increased the size of monthly purchases with its bond-buying program by €20 billion to €80 billion a month and extended the program by several months through March, 2017.
In addition, the ECB introduced a new series of Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) and announced that it will be purchasing non-financial corporate debt issued by companies established in the euro zone. While Draghi noted that he expects rates to remain low through the completion of the asset purchasing program, he emphasized at a press conference on Thursday that he doesn't see a need to cut rates any further.
""In taking into the account the measures to grow and return to our price stability objective we do not anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce further rates,"" Draghi said. ""Of course new facts can change the outcome.""
Draghi's comments may have been misconstrued by investors, as Thursday's sharp appreciation in the euro runs counter to the ECB's goal of pulling the currency down as a way of bolstering exports. The one-day gains in the euro are the strongest since early-December when the ECB disappointed markets by approving only limited easing measures at its final meeting of 2015.
Investors now turn their attention to next week's Federal Reserve meeting where the U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave short-term interest rates at their current level. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged to 98.42 following the release of the Monetary Policy statement, before settling at 96.19, down more than 1%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Expectations for a fresh shot of stimulus from the European Central Bank on Thursday pushed down the euro and government bond yields in the morning, after New Zealand set the bar high with a surprise rate cut that sent its currency tumbling.
Europe's main stock markets got off to a solid start, with London's FTSE (FTSE), the DAX in Frankfurt (GDAXI) and the CAC40 in Paris (FCHI) adding between 0.1 and 0.3 percent to the 13 percent they have gained over the last month.
The euro was down at $1.0970 <EUR=>, while euro zone bond yields from Germany to Greece were slightly lower as traders did some final buying ahead of the ECB's 1245 GMT interest rate decision and 1330 GMT news conference by governor Mario Draghi.
Having disappointed markets with an unspectacular package of measures in December, the bank's policymakers have tried to avoid stirring up speculation ahead of this meeting - although that hasn't stopped eager economists.
The latest Reuters poll shows bets are on at least another 10 basis points being sliced off its already negative -0.3 percent deposit rate and the bank adding another 10 billion euros a month to its 1.5 trillion euro bond-buying program.
The ECB has a huge range of options, though, from scrapping the lower price limit it is prepared to buy at, purchasing more risky types of asset backed securities to tiering its negative rates and being more targeted with its government bond buys.
""The market is a bit wishy washy, not a whole lot is priced in because of the doubts over whether they (ECB) can really deliver,"" said Saxo bank head of FX strategy John Hardy.
""So if you get some real innovation from the ECB you will see a big reaction from the euro. Especially if they can change the capital key (country-by-country purchase percentages) or there are new measures geared at helping banks' balance sheets.""
Oil prices, one of the main drivers behind the rapid fall in inflation which has been such a headache for central banks like the ECB, were steady in early European trading, with benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) holding at just over $40 a barrel.
The ECB will also release new economic forecasts later. They will not have captured the recent rebound in oil so are likely to show inflation this year at zero, or maybe even negative, which would be the first time ever they have done so for a year.
KIWI'S WINGS CLIPPED
The big surprise in Asia overnight came from New Zealand's central bank, which pre-empted the ECB by cutting its main interest rate to a record low 2.25 percent.
The Kiwi dollar tumbled <NZD=D4> to $0.6618 as Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler cited China as a major risk to the bank's outlook for economic growth and inflation, reflecting global concerns over a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
""If China had a very significant and prolonged devaluation, it would in essence spread deflation around the world,"" Wheeler told reporters, adding that China was building up a number of serious imbalances.
Asian stocks edged up meanwhile, encouraged by the previous day's rally in crude prices and expectations that an aggressive showing from the ECB later could see dovish reactions from the Bank of Japan, Fed, Swiss National Bank and Bank of England which all meet over the next week and a bit.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) nudged up 0.3 percent. Volatile Shanghai stocks , however, dropped 2 percent after stronger-than-expected local inflation data was interpreted as a negative for the struggling economy. [.SS]

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell around a third of a cent against the dollar on Thursday, anticipating further policy easing by the European Central Bank, while the New Zealand dollar hit a two-week low after a surprise rate cut there. 
Expectations are high that ECB policymakers will deliver a telling blow in the central bank's campaign to get inflation rising again and drag the euro zone economy out of the mire after eight years of weak growth. 
But senior currency sales managers at a handful of major banks say that speculators are probably only about a third as much engaged on the euro as they were before a December decision that underwhelmed and left many investments underwater. 
""The ECB will probably try to deliver more than the market expects to get a real effect from these measures. That means that besides the rate cut that seems to be priced in by markets, we will get something on the QE side,"" said Daniel Trum, a currency strategist with the wealth management arm of giant Swiss group UBS. 
    ""But we also acknowledge that there is a risk that they under-deliver as in December, and that would obviously strengthen the euro."" 
The New Zealand dollar sank by almost 2 cents <NZD=D4> after the Reserve Bank shocked most in markets by cutting its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent, citing a material decline in a range of inflation expectation measures. 
The central bank also signalled there would be at least one more rate cut to come.
""All in, its a clear negative signal for the kiwi,"" said Citi strategist Todd Elmer. ""The question is the degree to which this can extend amid a backdrop of globally rising risk appetite.""
The New Zealand currency had recovered around 0.2 percent from the lows hit overnight, but at $0.6635 was still down almost 2 cents from lows hit after the decision. 
The ECB is widely expected to cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.40 percent, but it will be the other announcements, and President Mario Draghi's comments in the news conference that follows that should generate the most action. 
Most important is how the ECB tries to shield banks from the fallout of negative rates, following a sell-off in global bank stocks on the issue. 

The common currency was down 0.3 percent at $1.0977 <EUR=> and 0.2 percent at 124.86 yen (EURJPY=).

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to a record-low 2.25 percent on Thursday, triggering a slide in the local dollar and sparking talk of a global currency war as countries seek to revitalize their economies in a world of slow growth.
New Zealand's move to trim the Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points follows the Bank of Japan's historic decision in January to adopt negative interest rates and comes ahead of the European Central Bank's policy review later in the day when it is expected to cut rates deeper into minus territory.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cited low domestic inflation and a deteriorating global economic outlook as factors in Thursday's rate cut, on the same day as Moody's ratings agency warned of a credit risk to the country's banks from tumbling dairy prices.
RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler said policy makers were concerned about slowing growth in China, and highlighted risks around Beijing's unexpected devaluation of the yuan in August - a move that sparked fears of a global currency war.
""If China had a very significant and prolonged devaluation it would in essence spread deflation around the world,"" Wheeler told reporters at a press conference.
Given China's dominant role in the international trading system ""by and large every other currency would be appreciating against the Chinese currency,"" he said.
The specter of currency devaluations took center stage at a meeting of G20 policy makers in Shanghai this month, especially after China's August move stoked uncertainty over its currency policy and after Japan's surprise shift to negative rates.
The G20 finance ministers however played down talk of beggar-thy-neighbor policies and agreed to inform each other in advance about policy decisions that could lead to currency devaluation.
While Thursday's RBNZ rate cut wasn't aimed at bringing down New Zealand's exchange rate, Wheeler said that ""pretty well most central banks would like to see their exchange rates lower."" A decline in the New Zealand dollar would ""be appropriate given the weakness in export prices,"" he said.
KIWI TUMBLES
The New Zealand dollar <NZD=D4> tumbled more than a cent and 2-year swap rates dropped to around 2.25 percent from around 2.45 percent late Wednesday as the RBNZ indicated that at least one more rate cut was likely.
""If there was a strong rationale for today's cut it was that the RBNZ wanted to shock the currency market by delivering a rate reduction that was unexpected,"" said BNZ Head of Research Stephen Toplis.
The slowdown in China and generally cooling global demand have hurt growth in New Zealand and pulled inflation sharply under the RBNZ's 1-3 percent target band. The central bank is now forecasting annual inflation at 1.1 percent by end-2016, down from its prior projection of 1.6 percent made at the December policy review.
Still, at 2.25 percent New Zealand has among the highest policy rates in the developed world - well clear of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the likes of Japan and the ECB - and ample room to deliver further cuts.
A snap Reuters poll showed 11 of 12 economists see NZ's policy rate at 2.00 percent by June, versus only 2 of 14 respondents who saw a similar outcome in an earlier survey taken prior to Thursday.
On the domestic front, RBNZ's Wheeler warned that the dairy sector faces challenges as the price of global dairy - the nation's biggest export earner - remain subdued.

That risk was underscored on Thursday by Moody's Investors Service. It said the decision by dairy giant Fonterra Cooperative Ltd. (NZ:FCG) (NZ:FSF) this week to lower its forecast payout to its farmer shareholders is ""credit negative for New Zealand banks.""

Overnight, the dollar trimmed gains against the other major currencies on Wednesday, re-approaching two-week lows as investors turned their attention to the European Central Bank’s upcoming policy meeting and as global growth concerns persisted.
The safe-haven yen remained supported after weak trade data out of China on Tuesday rekindled concerns over a possible slowdown in global economic growth.
China’s exports slumped 25% in February, the biggest drop since May 2009.
The yen also strengthened following reports that the Bank of Japan may refrain from cutting interest rates at its monetary policy review next week.
Reuters reported Wednesday that the BoJ will refrain from further easing after January’s shock decision to deploy negative interest rates failed to prevent the appreciation of the yen.
The euro weakened as the ECB is widely expected to cut rates further into negative territory at the conclusion of its monetary policy review on Thursday.
The bank is also expected to enlarge its asset purchasing program in a bid to combat persistently low levels of inflation in the euro area.

809,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2016 05:43PM ET</span>",EUR/USD inches down ahead of pivotal ECB Governing Council meeting,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD inched down on Wednesday, as currency traders remained cautious ahead of a highly-anticipated interest rate decision from the European Central Bank.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0946 and 1.1035, before settling fractionally lower at 1.0999. EUR/USD has been relatively steady over the last two and a half weeks, closing in a band between 1.086 and 1.102 in each of the last 14 sessions. Since the start of the 2016 calendar year, the euro has edged up its American counterpart by approximately 1.35%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0709, the low from January 5 and was met with resistance at 1.1378, the high from Feb. 11.
As expected, foreign exchange traders were hesitant to make any major moves in advance of Thursday's closely-watched ECB Governing Council meeting in Frankfurt. In recent weeks, ECB president Mario Draghi has sent strong signals that the central bank will approve further easing initiatives as a means for bolstering economic growth throughout the euro zone and staving off inflation. When the central bank last met in January, it held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.05. The ECB could also lower its deposit and margin facility rates, while increasing the scope of its €60 billion a month bond buying program.
The euro has struggled against the dollar since last January when the ECB announced the launching of a comprehensive Quantitative Easing program aimed at staving off deflation and bolstering growth in the area. The program involves the purchase of €60 billion a month of assets by the central bank in order to increase the amount of money supply available for banks to lend money to businesses and individuals. Large-scale easing initiatives also typically push interest rates lower, reducing domestic investments by foreign purchasers and weakening the local currency against its main rivals.
Analysts from ING have estimated that EUR/USD could fall as much as 1.5% if the ECB approves added stimulus, including raising the total of monthly asset purchases by as much as €5 billion. In addition, a group of a dozen analysts forecasted that the Governing Council could lower the deposit between 10 and 20 basis points and extend the bond buying program from anywhere between three and six months.
In the U.S., wholesale inventories rose by 0.3% in January, increasing by the highest level since last June and halting a three-month streak of negative moves. Analysts expected to see a slight decline of 0.1% for the month. As a result, the inventory to sales ratio fell by 1.3%, marking its fourth consecutive monthly decline.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell to an intraday low of 96.94, before rebounding to settle at 97.19 on a volatile day of trading. The index, which is down more than 1% over the last two months, remained near two-week lows on Wednesday.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose five basis points to 1.88%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year added six basis points to 0.24%. While yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries have fallen 30 basis points over the last year, they have rebounded 16 basis points over the last month."
810,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2016 12:38PM ET</span>",Venezuela's new dual forex rate to start on Thursday,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's new dual foreign exchange system, with one rate fixed at 10 bolivars to the dollar and another ""floating"" at a starting rate of 206 bolivars, will come into operation from Thursday, the vice president for economy said.
Miguel Perez, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, reiterated that the OPEC nation's socialist government was ""religiously"" honoring foreign debt payments and did not have solvency problems despite the current ""economic emergency."" 
Venezuela last month made a $1.5 billion debt payment, but investors are fretting as to whether it will be able to pay state oil company PDVSA's heavier obligations later in the year.
""Venezuela does not have a solvency problem,"" Perez said. ""We have a cash-flow problem.""
The official said details of the new foreign exchange mechanism would be published on Thursday, meaning the system would come into being from then.
The 10 bolivar rate at the newly-named Dipro system would be used for priority food and medicine sectors, Perez said.
The second, complementary system would be known as Dicom, he added, and would apply to most other areas, including the oil sector and - a controversial subject locally - foreign currency for Venezuelan tourists or students abroad.
The Dicom rate would start at 206 bolivars to the dollar, the same as the current Simadi mechanism, but then ""fluctuate according to the country's economic dynamic,"" he said.
Venezuela previously had a three-tiered official currency control system. 
On the black market, greenbacks currently fetch 1,145 bolivars, according to the widely-tracked DolarToday web site.
Critics note that the government has repeatedly announced ""free-floating"" systems that withered away precisely because authorities never allowed them to be determined by demand.
Currency and price controls have been a major factor in Venezuela's current economic mess, which includes snarling food lines, widespread shortages, and a lucrative smuggling trade.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's (N:BLK) chief investment officer of global fixed income, Rick Rieder, said on Wednesday his team cut a February position they held shorting, or betting against, the U.S. dollar while betting on Japanese yen appreciation.
Now, he said, ""we have reversed"" and are now favoring the U.S. dollar.
Rieder said he does not believe U.S. stocks are undervalued ""at all,"" underscoring that his remarks at a conference yesterday that stocks could ""maybe"" go up five percent to 10 percent this year were not a prediction and that such a rally would be surprising.
In fact, according to Rieder, the ""upside in equities is much more limited"" as corporate cash flow moderates and the cost of financing moves such as share buybacks has increased, ending what Rieder called ""the greatest arbitrage in history.""
The BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund , a mutual fund managed by Rieder that enjoys wide latitude in picking investments, cut all of its net exposure to the euro, Japanese yen and British pound in February, according to a BlackRock report released on Tuesday.
Rieder said his team has increased its portfolios' exposure to high-yield debt and emerging markets to boost yields as fixed-income markets are starved by low, and in some cases, negative rates.

New York-based BlackRock oversaw $4.6 trillion in assets globally as of Dec. 31, 2015, with a third of those held in fixed-income products.

A weaker currency has been a key element of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic program, known as Abenomics, helping to boost exports.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2016 03:38AM ET</span>","Yen firmer, euro dragged down before ECB meeting","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - A moderately risk-averse tone dominated currency markets on Wednesday, with the safe-haven yen broadly higher amid anxiety about a slowdown in China.
The low-yielding euro, which tends to do well during times of financial market uncertainty, however, underperformed and was weaker before a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. The ECB is expected to take rates deeper into negative territory and announce more asset purchases in a bid to boost inflation.
The dollar was 0.2 percent lower against the yen at 112.44 yen , having slid 0.7 percent on Tuesday. The euro, too, was 0.5 percent lower at 123.55 yen (EURJPY=) and 0.3 percent lower against the dollar at $1.0975.
The yen has been a winner so far this week after China's exports tumbled by the most in more than six years last month. The soft China data highlighted risks facing the global economy, bolstering expectations for dovish outcomes at central bank policy reviews in Europe, Canada and New Zealand.
""The poor Chinese data is fuelling risk aversion, but that is slowly giving way to some positioning adjustment before the ECB meeting,"" said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea.
""Given expectations are so high that the ECB will ease policy, there is a chance that it could fall short and we could see a bounce in the euro.""
Those positioning for more losses in the euro are wary about placing significant bets against it, after being burned in December when the ECB eased policy less than expected. The euro rose 4 percent against the dollar on Dec. 3 when the ECB action fell short of market expectations.
This time, many investors are betting the ECB will lower the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.40 percent, extend asset purchases and possibly introduce tiered interest rates, like the Bank of Japan.
""The focal point is how long the market will attempt to price in the risk of the ECB meeting ending in disappointment. The euro could rise towards the $1.11 handle if attempts to pre-empt such risk continue,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. 
Also on the defensive, the New Zealand dollar traded at $0.6744 , retreating from Friday's peak of $0.6820. While markets imply a small chance of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Thursday, investors suspect it is only a matter of time before it delivers another cut to the 2.5 percent cash rate.

In contrast, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep rates on hold on Wednesday. But a retreat in oil prices took a toll on the Canadian dollar, which eased to C$1.3416 per USD , from a 3-1/2 month peak of C$1.3262 set on Monday.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>",Hedge funds back off bets on China devaluation,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Two of the three types of hedge funds which bet heavily on a sharp devaluation of China's yuan last year have backed off the trade, leaving only some ultra-bearish ""Black Swan"" investors holding long-term bets, fund managers and bankers said.
Hedge fund sales desks at four of Wall Street's biggest banks told Reuters that many U.S. players had made money betting against China by the time Beijing took aggressive steps to prop up the currency in early January. 
Heavy official intervention, limits on some capital movement and a reduction in the amount of yuan available offshore prompted many players either to cut exposure or walk away from the trade by the Lunar New Year holiday last month, they said.
That has left in place chiefly ""tail risk"" funds like Mark Hart's Texas-based Corriente Partners or Kyle Bass, who have suggested China would have to devalue the yuan by up to 50 percent to rebalance its economy.
The yuan  fell almost 7 percent in a steady depreciation in offshore markets that started in November and bottomed out at 6.75 yuan per dollar on Jan. 7. Since then it has recovered roughly half of that value.
Derivatives pricing for the yuan  has fallen back to levels not seen since the end of November. 
""It would seem China would like to hold the line, for a while maybe. We've seen a lot more outflows, a lot of defending of the currency,"" Hart told Wall Street pay video service www.RealVision.com. 
""There have been a couple of engineered short squeezes, which have primarily effected those who had a spread on or those who were short spot CNH.""
Hart said he still believes China will need to devalue.
RETREAT
The big trade in December and January for hedge funds like Hart's was the low-delta risk reversal, an option contract that only pays out in the event of a very sharp move away from current exchange rates.
Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and banks' options desks showed large bets going on such options, betting on a fall in the yuan to 7.5-8 per dollar within the next year. 
""There isn't a hedge fund on the planet that did not have this trade on somehow but the peak of that positioning is past,"" said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the six biggest currency trading banks in London. 
""It's still a very popular long but it is not at the same peak. The more active FX guys who have been in and out of the spot, a lot of them were squeezed out in February. Then you have the buy and hold, tail-risk sorts of investors. They are still in.""
Even so, other bankers and fund managers note that the retreat in pricing on a yuan depreciation has been far less pronounced than it was after Beijing tried and then retreated on a sharp one-off devaluation last August. 
Whereas from September the six-month low-delta option fell from highs of 4.4 percent to 1.8 percent, this time it has retreated from 4.6 percent to just under 3 percent. 
The one-year contract in the same periods for comparison went from 9.6 to 4.5 percent last year, and 10.7 to 7 percent. 
""There is a huge divergence between what happened then and what happened in the past month,"" said Chris Morrison, Head of Strategy with Omni Macro Fund in London.
""After the August move subsided the forward points went lower, vols (implied volatility) went lower. This time that has not happened; the market is clearly saying that this stability is temporary. 

""Ultimately for China it is a stay of execution.""

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0994 and 1.1054, before settling at 1.1012, down 0.0002 or 0.02% on the session. With the slight losses, the euro halted a modest, brief four-day winning streak. EUR/USD has gained roughly 2% in comparison with its level last March when it tumbled to multi-year lows amid expectations that the Federal Reserve was on the verge of ending a seven-year zero interest rate policy.

Investors are expected to remain cautious ahead of Thursday's critical ECB Governing Council meeting in Frankfurt. At the meeting, is widely expected to approve a host of easing measures aimed at bolstering growth throughout the euro zone. When the central bank last met in January, it held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.05. At Thursday's meeting, the ECB could lower its deposit and margin facility rates, while increasing the scope of its €60 billion a month bond buying program.
The ECB's interest rate decision carries broad ramifications on central banking maneuvering worldwide, ahead of meetings by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan later next week. In late-January, the BOJ rattled global currency markets with a shocking decision to lower a key interest rate into negative territory. A largely dovish monetary policy decision from the ECB could compel the Fed to slow the current pace of its tightening cycle.
Over the weekend, economists at the Bank of International Settlements warned of the potential consequences that could ensue if a host of major central banks continue to hold interest in negative territory for a long period of time. Currently, central banks in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan have lowered key interest rates into negative territory.
""There is great uncertainty about the behavior of individuals and institutions if rates were to decline further into negative territory or remain negative for a prolonged period,"" the BIS wrote in a report. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell to a fresh two-week low at 96.89, before rallying to close at 97.16.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2016 09:40AM ET</span>",Will euro do a yen if the ECB disappoints markets?,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to ease monetary policy this week, but some currency investors say it may not be enough to weaken the euro.
Indeed, if the ECB disappoints, the euro could even rise, they said, as the yen did after a surprise decision by the Bank of Japan on Jan. 29 to adopt negative interest rates.
Those positioning for more losses in the euro are wary about betting on bold and significant action, having been burned in December when the ECB eased policy less than expected.
As the following graphic shows, the day after the Dec. 3 meeting, the euro rose over 4 percent against the dollar <EUR=>, disappointing hedge funds and speculators who had positioned on more.
Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/1U1uqzj
The euro's rise came against the backdrop of expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, something it duly did on Dec. 16.
This time, many investors are betting the ECB will lower the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.40 percent, extend asset purchases and possibly introduce tiered interest rates, like the Bank of Japan.
""The market is positioned for these along with some dovish communication from the ECB,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. ""If it falls short, then we could see a bounce in the euro in the near term.""
The euro has gained 1.7 percent against the dollar so far this year to trade above $1.10 despite expectations of further easing by the ECB. That is primarily because the low-yielding euro has tended to do well when risk appetite is diminished. Stocks have got off to a rocky start to 2016.
Similarly, the safe-haven yen ignored the Bank of Japan's move to deploy negative interest rates on Jan. 29. The yen is up nearly 5 percent against the dollar since the BOJ move.
So will deeper negative rates push down the euro?

""If the market is unsure about what the ECB will do, and what impact it could have, it is also unsure about the FX effects of negative rate cuts after the BOJ's botched-up move,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) currency strategist Kit Juckes.

838,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2016 06:10PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ticks up, following dovish inflation remarks by Fed's Brainard","Investing.com -- EUR/USD posted modest gains on Monday after a pair of highly-respected Federal Reserve governors offered diverging viewpoints on whether rising inflation is close to reaching the U.S. central bank's objective, adding further confusion on the timing of its next interest rate hike.
The currency pair traded between 1.094 and 1.1025 before settling at 1.1012, up 0.0021 or 0.19% on the session. The euro has closed higher in three of the last four sessions against the dollar. Since falling to three-weeks lows at 1.0823 last week, the euro has rallied approximately 1.3% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The euro pared earlier losses after Fed governor Lael Brainard clearly enumerated why the U.S. central bank should remain patient in raising short-term interest rates in a speech at a banking conference on Monday afternoon. Citing a lack of assurance that inflation is moving closer to the Fed's long-term target of 2%, Brainard indicated that she would be hesitant to approve further rate hikes until domestic prices showed further signs of firming.
""There's some troubling signs that inflation expectations have actually slipped downwards. That is a risk to the outlook that I'm looking at carefully,"" Brainard told CNBC. ""We have strong cross currents from abroad. We have weak growth in the emerging economies, weak growth in Japan and the euro area and of course weakness coming over from China. There is some downside to the domestic outlook, so that's why I am very focused on preserving and protecting the progress we've made.""
In a separate speech on Monday, Fed governor Stanley Fischer took an opposing view on the pace of inflationary gains, as persistently low oil prices have begun to rebound and a stronger dollar continues to level. In January the Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge on inflation, rose to 1.7% -- its highest level since February, 2013.
""We may well at present be seeing the first stirring of an increase in the inflation rate -- something that we would like to happen,"" Fischer said at a banking conference in Washington.
Investors continue to await a highly-anticipated meeting by the European Central Bank on Thursday, where the ECB's Governing Council is widely expected to approve a host of easing measures aimed at bolstering growth throughout the euro zone. When the central bank last met in January, it held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.05. At Thursday's meeting, the ECB could lower its deposit and margin facility rates, while increasing the scope of its €60 billion a month bond buying program.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.25% to an intraday low of 97.05, before settling at 97.12. The index is down more than 2% over the last two months of trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday on bets of stimulus from the European Central Bank meeting later this week to support fragile euro zone growth, while the dollar firmed following a solid payrolls report last week.
Most commodity currencies were little changed amid recent gains in oil and industrial metal prices and following assurance from China this weekend the world's second-largest economy isn't heading for a hard landing.
""There is a lot of expectations with what the ECB would do,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
The ECB is expected on Thursday to push interest rates further into negative territory and make some kind of adjustment to its 1.1 trillion euro bond-purchase program, but after the bank disappointed many in markets in December, traders were loath to bet more heavily against the single currency. 
The euro was 0.5 percent lower at $1.0950  and down 0.7 percent at 124.34 yen (EURJPY=).
The greenback rose on the euro weakness as well as traders' reassessment of Friday's jobs report that showed stronger-than-forecast hiring in February and a surprise dip in average hourly earnings.
The dollar had slipped on Friday as some investors focused on the disappointing wage aspect of the report, but it has since rebounded on the view of a diminished likelihood of a U.S. recession in the coming months.
""The U.S. economy is doing relatively well. The dollar will likely hang on to its gains right now,"" Mizuho's Harajli said.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.3 percent at 97.639.
But the dollar slipped against the yen, last down 0.1 percent at 113.60 yen .
Meanwhile, most commodity currencies were flat to marginally lower against the dollar even as spot iron ore prices surged nearly 20 percent to over eight-month highs partly on bets on stronger Chinese demand.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2016 05:14AM ET</span>","China February FX reserves fall to $3.20 trillion, lowest since late 2011","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves fell $28.57 billion in February, slightly less than expected and easing from January's slump, suggesting the central bank is scaling back its interventions to support the yuan as capital outflows slow.
Still, China's foreign reserves declined for a fourth straight month, and the $3.20 trillion at the end of February was the lowest level since December 2011, data from the People's Bank of China showed on Monday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had predicted reserves would fall $30 billion from $3.23 trillion at the end of January.
China's reserves are still the world's largest, but it has been burning through them at such a pace that some analysts believe Beijing might soon have to allow a sharp fall in the value of the yuan or back-pedal on liberalization and tighten capital controls. 
""It shows that outflows did slow down somewhat, but there are a lot of factors,"" said Yang Zhao, chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong
The yuan steadied in February after volatile moves in December and January, helped in part by a weaker dollar as expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes faded, Zhou said. 
There may also have been an impact from the long Lunar New Year holidays in early February, when many firms close for extended periods and business activity slows, he added.
""The central bank and other top officials have repeatedly expressed a desire for stabilization and said there's no basis for large scale depreciation in the yuan. Equally important, the market has quickly downgraded expectations for a rapid lift-off (in interest rates) by the U.S. Federal Reserve.""
Capital outflows from China have increased since its surprise devaluation of the yuan last August, and have been fanned by concerns about its economic slowdown and expectations of higher U.S. rates. That has prompted the central bank to sell dollars in the currency markets to support the yuan and crack down on forex trading which it suspected to be speculation.
China's reserves sunk $99.5 billion in January and $107.9 billion in December, the biggest monthly drop on record. For 2015 as a whole, its reserves fell $513 billion, the largest annual drop in history.
""In February the government instituted a lot of administrative measures, which may have been able to slow down the outflows,"" Kevin Lai, chief economist of Asia ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets said, in a note. 
Heavy outflows of funds from China in recent months may also have been exaggerated by Chinese companies rushing to repay dollar-denominated debt, rather than widespread capital flight, 
the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said on Sunday, a view that has also been raised by China's central bank governor. 
MARKETS STILL SEE YUAN WEAKENING
On Monday, the central bank's vice governor said the nation's foreign exchange reserves are ample and reasonable, cross-border capital flows are manageable and China's economic fundamentals are sound. Governor Zhou Xiaochuan also said during a just-ended G20 meeting that changes in China's foreign reserves were normal.
Growing confidence among officials that they have snuffed out expectations of further yuan depreciation could free up the central bank for more aggressive monetary easing which the slowing economy deeply needs, ING economist Tim Condon said in a note before the reserve data, predicting it could cut interest rate again before the end of March. 
But while outflows may cool as the yuan steadies, many analysts believe the central bank still faces a tough job keeping the yuan stable, especially as the economy faces persistent downward pressure.
Chinese officials insist they see no reason for further depreciation, but analysts polled by Reuters believe the yuan will weaken another 3.5 percent against the dollar over the next 12 months, though a sharp, one-off devaluation is not seen on horizon.
The yuan has weakened about 5 percent against the dollar since the August devaluation, but less against a basket of currencies which China is increasingly referencing in hopes of making exchange rate movements less volatile.
China also said its gold reserves stood at $71.01 billion at the end of February, up from January's $63.57 billion.
By volume, gold reserves rose to 57.5 million troy ounces in February, up from 57.18 million at the end of January. 
Worries about China's foreign exchange rate policy flared again in early January when the central bank suddenly allowed the yuan to slide sharply, raising fears it could set off a wave of competitive devaluations which could destabilize the global economy and financial markets.
But, as in the aftermath of the August devaluation, Chinese authorities quickly and forcefully intervened to head off a sharper slide.

851,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2016 06:27PM ET</span>","EUR/USD surges above 1.10, as investors raise odds for Fed hike in March","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose sharply on Friday moving above 1.10 for the first time in March, as investors dismissed the possibility of a March interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve after average hourly wages fell slightly last month.
The currency pair traded between 1.0905 and 1.1043, before settling at 1.1006, up 0.0049 or 0.45% on the session. After opening March at near three-week lows, the euro has closed higher against the dollar in each of the last three sessions. Previously, the euro tumbled nearly 4% against its American counterpart amid strong indications that the European Central Bank will use nearly all of the tools at its disposal next week to help bolster weak economic growth throughout the euro zone.
While Friday's monthly jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor could mostly be characterized as positive, investors focused on a slight decrease in  average hourly earnings by 0.1% in February following robust gains of 0.5% a month earlier. It marked the first decline in hourly wages for a single month since the end of 2014. For all employees on private nonfarm payrolls, average hourly earnings fell 0.03 to $25.35 following gains of 0.12 in January. Wages among nonsupervisory employees and workers in private-sector production were unchanged at $21.32 an hour. On an annual basis, average hourly earnings rose by 2.2%, falling by 0.3% from the previous month after a host of state minimum wage increases went into effect at the start of the year.
Over the last several years, the Federal Open Market Committee has expressed significant concerns related to the slow pace of wage growth, as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the Great Recession. The disappointing reading could compel the U.S. central bank to delay the timing of its next interest rate hike beyond the first half of 2016. At the end of last year, the FOMC raised the target range of its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 and 0.50%, ending a seven-year zero interest rate policy.
The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool lowered the probability of an interest rate hike at the FOMC's meeting on March 15-16 to 1.9% on Friday, down from 29.6% a day earlier. There is still a 32% chance the FOMC will raise rates in June, according to the CME, up from 4.2% a month ago.
Nonfarm payrolls, meanwhile, soared by 242,000 in February, above consensus estimates of 190,000 and significantly higher than January's upwardly revised total of 172,000. The Labor Department reported employment gains in Health Care, Social Assistance and Food Services and Drinking Places, while recording losses in the struggling mining sector. Since December, the U.S. economy has added an average of 225,000 jobs per month.
The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.9%, one month after falling to its lowest level in eight years. The U-6 unemployment rate, which measures the level of workers that are marginally attached to the labor market, fell 0.2 to 9.7%. By comparison, the Fed's preferred gauge of U.S. unemployment, peaked at 18% in 2010 at the end of the Financial Crisis.
Investors turn their attention to the ECB's monetary policy meeting next Thursday in Frankfurt, where its Governing Council is  widely expected to approve a wide range of stimulus measures. When the central bank last met in January, it held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.05. Next week, the ECB could lower its deposit and margin facility rates, while increasing the scope of its €60 billion a month bond buying program.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose four basis points to 1.87%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year soared seven basis points to 0.24%. Yields on both government bonds are down by more than 10 basis points over the last year. On Friday, yields on 10-year Treasuries reached an intraday high of 1.902%, considerably above their low from Feb. 11 when they slid to 1.53%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.40% to an intraday low of 97.03, before rallying to 97.25 at the close.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields.

Currency intervention by the BOJ could come in handy for financial markets because the real economy seems to be doing just fine. The yen has gained almost 10% since 29th of January after the adoption of negative interest rates. Unfortunately the change will be disadvantageous after the BOJ printed trillions of dollars’ worth of yen in hopes of weakening the currency to support the exports and revive growth. Japan, as a major economy, has the worst economic principles of all time.
The debt of Japan is almost twice as big as Greece has, but an even bigger problem is caused by the rapidly declining population. It is predicted that by the year 2060 it will decline by 1 million of inhabitants every year, which basically means we will see a decrease from 128 million in 2008 to 86 million in 2060. Without the government reorganizing its debt at some point, it will be really hard to survive unless a massive amount of the public debt is written off.
Haruhiko Kuroda [governor of BOJ] criticized investors' repulsive approach to persistent volatility and backed the negative interest rate agenda despite concerns over the effectiveness of such acts. The head of the BOJ also noted that bank profits were increasing over the years of ultra-easy monetary policy. He had shown signs of doubt over criticism that extreme stimulus policy is putting too much risk in destabilizing Japan's banking system by squeezing returns on lending. Bank earnings were on the rise due to the decline in corporate bankruptcies caused by the recovering economy. Kuroda also stated that bank lending was intensified.
The Japanese government ruled by Abe is considering a front-loaded supplemental budget to be implemented at the beginning of the new fiscal year. Frustrating CPI figures reported earlier today and a core measure falling back to zero are signs of a desperate need for monetary stimulus from the BOJ.
Japanese CPI continued to show declining tendency as it hit 0% indicating that the Bank of Japan could set negative interest rates to deepen their massive monetary stimulus program. Tokyo CPI Ex Fresh Food was at the zero line last year, just as expected, however it sank even further below the 0.1% rate seen in December.
Interest on bank deposits are not expected to reach below zero, which basically means that depositors pay interest, even if Japan's long-term interest rates will be negative. The same principle applies to loans and corporate bonds, a team of experts on financial law said on Friday. The committee's decisions are not legally binding. Keeping in mind that the panel's lawyers and academics are leading experts in relevant regulations, this could become compulsory. Professor Seiichi Yamada and Kunihiko Morishita are heads of this committee, with its secretariat at the BOJ.
Long-term interest rates in the market hit 0% and went even further than that in January after the central bank decided to ratify a negative interest rate policy targeting some funds deposited by financial institutions. The committee had stated that banks are not allowed to demand interest from their customers, on the other hand financial institutions could compensate this by charging fees.


A previous forecast of Japan's GDP 0.8% growth was down 0.2% according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development statement on Thursday. The change in the forecast was influenced by the yen’s recent rise and downturn in its trading partners' economy. With declining crude oil prices and unstable financial markets the global economy is expected to remain stagnant according to the OECD.

The Markit construction purchasing managers' index fell to 54.2 from January’s 55.0. Economists had expected the index to tick up to 55.5.

Housebuilding expanded at the slowest pace since June 2013 and construction firms hired staff at the weakest rate in two-and-a-half years.
The report came a day after a similar survey of the manufacturing sector, which showed that activity slumped to the lowest in almost three years in February.
""Aside from the pre-election slowdown last year, the latest upturn in construction output was the weakest for over-two-and-a-half years,"" Tim Moore, senior economist from survey compiler Markit, said.
""What's different this time around is that construction companies have cut back on employment growth in response to the uncertain business outlook,"" Moore said.

The currency pair traded between 1.0835 and 1.0894, before settling at 1.0868, down 0.0018 or 0.17% on the session. The euro has fallen against the dollar in each of the last three sessions and 11 of the last 13. Since surging to three-month highs on February 11, the euro has plummeted by more than 3.75% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Tuesday morning, Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index for euro zone manufacturers fell 1.1 points in February to 51.2, as considerable price cuts failed to create a demand spike in new orders. It came one day after the EU's statistic bureau said consumer prices throughout the zone fell by 0.2% on an annual basis in February, falling back into deflation for the first time in four months. As a result, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have lowered their annual growth outlook for the area.
The release of the disappointing economic data could compel ECB president Mario Draghi to use all of the tools at his disposal next Thursday to help jumpstart the European economy. At next week's meeting, the ECB Governing Council could lower its deposit and marginal lending facility rates and extend the scope of its comprehensive quantitative easing program. The program involves the purchase of €60 billion a month of assets by the central bank in order to increase the amount of money supply available for banks to lend money to businesses and individuals. Large-scale easing initiatives also typically push interest rates lower, reducing domestic investments by foreign purchasers and weakening the local currency against its main rivals.
Separately, improved unemployment data released on Tuesday provided some signs of encouragement. In January, euro zone unemployment fell by 0.1% to 10.3%, falling to its lowest rate since August, 2011. Meanwhile, unemployment in the EU dropped 0.1 to 8.9%, its lowest level since 2009.
In the U.S., the dollar moved higher after the ISM reported that February PMI rose 1.3 points to 49.5, slightly above consensus forecasts of a 0.3 increase to 48.5. Employment, which has hovered near seven-year lows in recent months, showed some signs of breaking through after jumping 2.6 points to 48.5. Production also soared 2.6 points last months to 52.8. While new orders stayed flat at 51.5, there were signs of demand growth within the report, as 12 of 18 industries reported an increase on the month.
Elsewhere, construction spending surged 1.5% in February and by more than 10% on an annual basis due to an uptick in highway & street spending, while U.S. auto sales soared 8% to a 15-year February high. As consumers take advantage of deep discounts at the pump and low borrowing rates, analysts expect yearly auto sales to eclipse last year's record-high of 17.5 million vehicles.
The Federal Reserve is closely observing incoming economic data, ahead of its next interest rate decision on March 16.

The currency pair traded between 1.0859 and 1.0962, before settling at 1.0875, down 0.0057 or 0.52% on the session. Since surging to three-month highs against the dollar in mid-February, the euro has closed lower in nine of the last 11 sessions. During that span, the euro has lost more than 3.7% versus the greenback. For the month as a whole, EUR/USD closed virtually flat, up 0.41%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Monday morning, Eurostat, the EU's statistic bureau said prices throughout the euro zone fell by 0.2% on an annual basis in February, representing the first time euro zone inflation fell into negative territory since September. Economists blamed the lion's share of the decline on persistently low oil prices, which have fallen more than 60% over the last 15 months. Following a 0.3% increase in January, euro zone inflation was expected to remain flat this month, according to consensus estimates.
Core inflation, which eliminates volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.7% on a yearly basis, slightly below forecasts for a 0.9% gain. It came one month after core inflation rose by 1.0% in January. The ECB, which is widely expected to approve a wide range of additional stimulus measures at its monetary policy on March 10, stood pat partly due to the negative impact of oil prices on inflation.
Elsewhere, further gains by the dollar were limited by a wave of disappointing data in the U.S. In a monthly report, the Institute for Supply Management said its Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) plummeted eight points in February to 47.6, falling outside consensus estimates for the third consecutive month. It came as backlog orders contracted for the 13th straight month, employment remained in contraction territory for a fifth consecutive month and prices contracted at their quickest pace since 2009. A subset enters contraction territory when its reading drops below 50.
Moments later, the National Association of Realtors said pending sales of existing homes slowed last month by 2.5% to 106.0, the lowest level since January of last year. On an annual basis, pending sales are up by just 1.4%, despite low unemployment figures and comparatively low mortgage rates. For the month of January, pending sales declined in three of the four regions of the U.S., with all but the South closing in the red.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose to three-week highs at 98.39, before falling slightly back to close at 98.28.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell three basis points to 1.73%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year lost four basis points to 0.11%. Yields on both 10-year government bonds fell at least 18 basis points on the month."

The currency pair traded between 1.0859 and 1.0962, before settling at 1.0875, down 0.0057 or 0.52% on the session. Since surging to three-month highs against the dollar in mid-February, the euro has closed lower in nine of the last 11 sessions. During that span, the euro has lost more than 3.7% versus the greenback. For the month as a whole, EUR/USD closed virtually flat, up 0.41%.

On Monday morning, Eurostat, the EU's statistic bureau said prices throughout the euro zone fell by 0.2% on an annual basis in February, representing the first time euro zone inflation fell into negative territory since September. Economists blamed the lion's share of the decline on persistently low oil prices, which have fallen more than 60% over the last 15 months. Following a 0.3% increase in January, euro zone inflation was expected to remain flat this month, according to consensus estimates.
Core inflation, which eliminates volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.7% on a yearly basis, slightly below forecasts for a 0.9% gain. It came one month after core inflation rose by 1.0% in January. The ECB, which is widely expected to approve a wide range of additional stimulus measures at its monetary policy on March 10, stood pat partly due to the negative impact of oil prices on inflation.
Elsewhere, further gains by the dollar were limited by a wave of disappointing data in the U.S. In a monthly report, the Institute for Supply Management said its Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) plummeted eight points in February to 47.6, falling outside consensus estimates for the third consecutive month. It came as backlog orders contracted for the 13th straight month, employment remained in contraction territory for a fifth consecutive month and prices contracted at their quickest pace since 2009. A subset enters contraction territory when its reading drops below 50.
Moments later, the National Association of Realtors said pending sales of existing homes slowed last month by 2.5% to 106.0, the lowest level since January of last year. On an annual basis, pending sales are up by just 1.4%, despite low unemployment figures and comparatively low mortgage rates. For the month of January, pending sales declined in three of the four regions of the U.S., with all but the South closing in the red.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose to three-week highs at 98.39, before falling slightly back to close at 98.28.

908,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2016 05:59PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls to 3-week low, amid strong U.S. inflation, GDP data","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Friday sliding to its lowest level in three weeks, as core inflation in the U.S. rose by its highest annual percentage in more than three years, bolstering hawkish arguments for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The currency pair traded between 1.0912 and 1.1069, before settling at 1.0932, down 0.0086 or 0.78% on the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in four of the last five and eight of the last 10 sessions. Since surging to three-month highs earlier this month, the euro has plunged more than 3.2% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Commerce in a monthly report said that personal income and consumer spending surged by 0.5% in January, both eclipsing consensus' estimates. Driven by sizeable increases in wages and salaries, personal income rose for the third time in four months, building on strong gains from December. Consumer spending, meanwhile, moved steadily higher paced by a 1.2% spike in durable goods purchases.
More tellingly, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index jumped by 1.3% in January from its level 12 month earlier, an improvement of 0.7 from December's level. The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.3% from the previous month, extending monthly gains from December. On a yearly basis, Core PCE surged by 1.7% from its level in January, 2015, also 0.3% higher from December's reading.
While Core PCE inflation has remained under the Fed's targeted objective for every month over the last three years, January's reading hit the high end of the central bank's central tendency estimate for 2016. Fed chair Janet Yellen has continually reiterated that long-term inflation will continue to move toward the Fed's targeted goal of 2%, as temporary factors from a stronger dollar and record-low energy prices recede. At the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) December meeting, the committee projected in its median forecasts that inflation will not reach 2% until 2018.
When the FOMC meets again next month, the committee will release its quarterly long-term economic projections, also known as its ""dot-plot."" The assessment includes long range projections for changes in Real GDP, unemployment, inflation and the Fed's benchmark interest rate. Since the FOMC ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy in December, threats of a global economic slowdown and extreme volatility in financial markets worldwide have prompted the U.S. central bank to reconsider its pace of tightening. The FOMC followed by holding the target range of the Federal Funds Rate at a level between 0.25% and 0.50% at a subsequent meeting in late-January.
But with the labor market nearing full employment, the strong inflation data could compel the Fed to reconsider the timing of its next interest rate hike. In its January statement, the FOMC emphasized that it will continue to employ a data-driven approach when deciding whether it is appropriate to lift interest rates.
""A data-driven Committee, making decisions meeting by meeting, is likely to surprise markets from time to time,"" Fed governor Jerome Powell said at a speech before the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum on Friday morning. Hours later, Lael Brainard, Powell's colleague on the FOMC, remarked that tightening financial conditions are the equivalent ""of three rate hikes.""
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Separately, the Commerce Department upwardly revised Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter to 1.0%, up from initial estimates of 0.7%. In Spain and France, February inflation data both came in slightly under consensus estimates.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD plunged 0.61% to 1.3870 after falling to fresh seven-year lows earlier in the session. Since the UK received special status in the EU late last week, the pound has crashed more than 3.2%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.80% to an intraday high of 98.29, before closing at 98.13. At session highs, the index reached its highest level in nearly three weeks.

920,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2016 06:06PM ET</span>","EUR/USD halts 3-day skid, amid lower euro zone inflation forecasts","Investing.com -- EUR/USD ticked up amid sharp downward revisions in euro zone inflation forecasts on Thursday, bolstering the case for further stimulus measures by the European Central Bank when its Governing Council stages its next monetary policy meeting in two weeks. 
The currency pair traded between 1.0988 and 1.1050 before settling at 1.1019, up 0.0005 or 0.05% on the session. With the modest gains, the euro halted a three-day losing streak against the dollar. Since falling to three-month lows versus the euro earlier this month, the dollar has rallied more than 2.3% over the last two weeks. During that span, the greenback has closed higher against its European counterpart in eight of the last 10 sessions. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Thursday morning, Eurostat, the EU's statistic agency, lowered its estimates for annual inflation in January by 0.1 to 0.3%, a troubling signal for the ECB, which is attempting to use all tools at its disposal to stave off threats of deflation. On a monthly basis, Eurostat now expects inflation in the euro inflation to plunge by 1.4%, after remaining flat in December. The forecasts were released days before initial estimates of February euro zone inflation come out early next week. 
ECB president Mario Draghi has sent strong indications that it will employ all means necessary to boost stubbornly low inflation and stimulate growth when the Governing Council meets on March 10. The ECB could lower its deposit and marginal lending facility rates or even increase the scope and frequency of its comprehensive Quantitative Easing program at the meeting. The euro has struggled against the dollar since last January when the ECB announced the launch of the asset purchasing initiative. The program involves the purchase of €60 billion a month of assets by the central bank in order to increase the amount of money supply available for banks to lend money to businesses and individuals. Large-scale easing programs also typically push interest rates lower, reducing domestic investments by foreign purchasers and weakening the local currency against its main rivals. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD gained 0.0029 or 0.21% to close at 1.3956, halting a three-day losing streak. The pound slid to a seven-year lows against the dollar on Wednesday, capping a steep fall triggered late last week when the UK reached an agreement with the EU that paves the way for a referendum on leaving the European bloc on June 23. 
In the U.S., the dollar pared earlier losses after the U.S. Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders surged by 4.9% in January, their strongest pace in 10 months, rebounding from the previous month when they slumped 4.6%.
Investors were fairly cautious ahead of a trio of economic releases on Friday morning. The second estimate of fourth quarter Real GDP is expected to come in at 0.4%, slightly below initial forecasts of 0.7%, while analysts anticipate a slight uptick in consumer sentiment from February's flash reading. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta lowered its forecast for GDP growth in the first quarter by 0.1 to 2.5%.
The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is forecasted to rise by 0.2% after a flat reading in December.

929,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2016 06:26PM ET</span>","GBP/USD falls to seven-year low, as IMF warns of risks related to Brexit","Investing.com -- GBP/USD fell to fresh seven-year lows on Wednesday, extending a massive three-day rout, as top lawmakers continued to debate the merits of a historic referendum that could enable the UK to leave the European Union in June. 
The currency pair traded between 1.3879 and 1.4017 in Wednesday's session, before settling at 1.3922, down 0.0099 or 0.71% on the session. Since UK prime minister David Cameron reached an agreement with European Commission leaders on Friday that granted Britain special status in the European bloc, the pound has plummeted more than 3% against the dollar. The pound encountered further downward pressure on Wednesday after a Bloomberg survey determined that sterling could drop as low as 1.35 versus the greenback within a week of Britain's departure, a level last seen in 1985. 
On Wednesday, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde warned that the steady growth achieved by the nation could be threatened in the months leading up to the June 23 vote. It came as HSBC cautioned that a potential Brexit could cause the pound to drop another 20%, creating a sharp rise in imports and spiraling inflation, which could force the Bank of England to raise interest rates. 
A yes vote in the referendum could also lead to heightened risks of contagion throughout the euro zone if other top nations decide to follow suit and demand special considerations from the EU. Many top economists believe that a mass departure could severely cripple the euro. 
“My hunch is that it is bound to be a negative on all fronts,"" Lagarde told CNN. ""For those that stay, because there are fewer of them, and for those who go, because they lose the benefit of facilitation of exchange."" 
“Uncertainty is bad in and of itself. No economic player likes uncertainty. They don’t invest, they don’t hire, they don’t make decisions in times of uncertainty,"" Lagarde added. 
The euro fell mildly by 0.04% against the dollar on Wednesday to close at 1.1016, the lowest closing level for the month. The euro has closed lower against its American counterpart in three consecutive sessions and eight of the last nine. EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
The dollar retreated from three-week highs reached in the European afternoon session, following the release of disappointing economic data in the U.S. The U.S. Commerce Department said Wednesday that new home sales plummeted 9.2% to a seasonally-adjusted 494,000, sharply below expectations for a 4.4% decline to 520,000. Sales in the West, a critical region for the new housing market, plunged 32% on the month. For the year, new home sales in the West, South and Midwest regions of the U.S. have fallen into negative territory. Separately, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) Services' Flash tumbled to 49.8 in February, dropping to its lowest level since October, 2013. Analysts expected the reading to stay flat at 53.7. 
Investors await a busy day of economic headlines on Friday when the second estimate of fourth quarter GDP and Personal Income and Outlays for January are released. The Core PCE Index, the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge for inflation, is expected to increase by 0.2% from December's total. Following the release, a trio of Fed policymakers, San Francisco Fed president John Williams and Fed governors Jerome Powell and Lael Brainard, are scheduled to deliver speeches on monetary policy and the economy. 
On Tuesday evening, Fed governor Stanley Fischer said that members of the Federal Open Market Committee are still uncertain on whether they will raise short-term interest rates at their next meeting in three weeks. While Fischer said the FOMC could discuss the prospects of implementing a negative interest rate policy, he indicated that it is unlikely that the U.S. central bank will push rates into sub-zero territory. 
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, reached an intraday high of 97.92 on Wednesday morning, before closing at 97.51, up 0.03% on the session.

942,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2016 05:37PM ET</span>","EUR/USD inches down, as BOE looks to shield pound from Brexit risks","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Tuesday, briefly dropping below 1.10 for the first time since early-February, as Bank of England governor Mark Carney admitted the risks of a potential Brexit from the European bloc have weighed on the pound since last week's agreement between the UK and the European Union paved the way for a referendum in June.
The currency pair traded between 1.0990 and 1.1124, before settling at 1.1016, down 0.0015 or 0.14% on the session. Since surging to three-month highs against the dollar in mid-February, the euro has closed lower against its American counterpart in seven of the last eight sessions. During that span, the euro has lost roughly 2.4% versus the greenback.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
One day after the pound plummeted almost 2% against the dollar, the sterling remained at six-year lows on Tuesday as investors continue to gauge the uncertainty related to Britain's historic decision on June 23. Appearing before the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, Carney testified that the referendum on Britain's membership in the EU is driving demand for protection of the sterling.
""Particularly, there has been a sharp increase in risk reversals - buying more downside protection against future falls in sterling around the referendum date as opposed to upside protection,"" Carney said in his testimony. ""They have spiked to levels consistent with around the height of the Scottish referendum.""
If economic conditions in the UK weaken as a result of fears related to Britain's possible departure from the bloc, Carney said the BOE would not hesitate to lowering interest rates even further. The BOE's benchmark rate has remained at record-lows of 0.5% for nearly seven years. Early next month, Carney and BOE Deputy Governor for Financial Stability Jon Cunliffe will appear again before lawmakers in a hearing devoted specifically to the ramifications of a potential Brexit.
A UK departure is also expected to weigh on the euro if other top nations in the euro zone follow suit by applying for special status from the EU.
In the U.S., further gains in the dollar were restrained by a flurry of soft economic data. On Tuesday morning, The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index for February fell sharply to 92.2 from a revised 97.8 a month earlier. With the considerable declines, consumer confidence in the U.S. fell to its lowest level since last July. Analysts expected the index to dip mildly by 0.6 to 97.2. Within the report, though, there were only signs of slight erosion in consumer confidence. Respondents who asserted that jobs are plentiful decreased mildly from 23.0 to 20.1%. Meanwhile, respondents who claimed that jobs are hard to get, increased moderately from 23.6% to 24.2%. The category is among one of the most closely-watched details of the survey.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said its Manufacturing Index fell to minus-4 in February, sliding to its lowest level since September. The subdued readings could compel analysts to scrutinize next week's U.S. February jobs report more closely. Following solid gains of 0.5% in average hourly earnings in January, a strong report this month may provide hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee with more ammunition in their arguments for an imminent interest rate hike. A host of FOMC members including Fed governors Stanley Fischer, Jerome Powell and Lael Brainard are scheduled to speak this week.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.

952,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2016 05:41PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls to near 3-week low, amid mounting fears of Brexit","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Monday, slipping to its lowest level in nearly three weeks as currency traders kept a close eye on soft manufacturing data throughout the euro zone, as well as fresh indications that the U.K. could leave the European Union if a historic referendum passes in June.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1004 and 1.1124 before settling at 1.1027, down 0.0104 or 0.93% on the session. The euro has now closed lower against its American counterpart in seven of the last eight and eight of the previous 10 sessions. Since reaching a three-month high at 1.1378 on February 11, the euro has fallen more than 2.3% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Investors on Monday continued to react to geopolitical news involving Britain's possible departure from the EU in the first full day of trading since U.K. prime minister David Cameron reached a deal with EU lawmakers on Friday night, which grants the nation special status with the European bloc. Over the weekend, London mayor Boris Johnson shockingly backed the so-called ""Brexit,"" declaring the June 23 referendum a ""vote for real change.""
As a result, GBP/USD plunged more than 1.8% to an intraday low of 1.4058, falling to its lowest level since March, 2009. A potential Brexit also weighs on the euro, as a departure by the UK from the EU exacerbates fears that other top nations in the euro zone will look to apply for special considerations.
Elsewhere, financial information services provider Markit said its Flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index fell to a 13-month low in February at 52.7. The index, which measures the combined output of the manufacturing and service sectors, was expected to drop to 53.3, after posting a final reading of 53.6 in January. The disappointing data increases the chances that the European Central Bank could implement more aggressive stimulus measures when it holds its next monetary policy meeting in March, Markit said in a note to investors. Also on Monday, a report in France showed that private sector activity fell into contraction territory last month, while business activity in Germany expanded at the slowest rate in seven months.
The dollar pared some of its early rally after Markit said its Flash U.S. PMI Manufacturing Index fell from 52.4 in January to 51.0 in February, its lowest rate since late-2012. Notably, backlog orders contracted at its highest level since September, 2009, during the depths of the Financial Crisis.
The greenback, though, held onto its gains, as investors digested solid inflation data from Friday's session. In January, the U.S. Department of Labor said its Core Consumer Price Index (CPI), surged by 1.4% from the prior 12 months last month, increasing 0.7% from already strong gains in December. The strong reading may bolster the odds that the Federal Reserve could approve multiple interest rate hikes before the end of the year.
Any rate hikes by the Fed in 2016 are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained one basis point to 1.75%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year lost three basis points to 0.17%. Yields on both government bonds have fallen by at least 30 basis points over the last month.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.95% to an intraday high of 97.57, before falling slightly back to 97.38 at the close. At session highs, the index reached its highest level in nearly three weeks."

967,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2016 05:32PM ET</span>","EUR/USD halts five-day losing skid, despite solid U.S. inflation data","Investing.com -- EUR/USD posted slight gains on Friday to end a five-day losing streak, amid solid U.S. inflation data which bolstered hawkish arguments for accelerated monetary policy normalization by the Federal Reserve this year.
The currency pair traded between 1.1067 and 1.1139 before settling at 1.1131, up 0.0024 or 0.22% on the session. Since surging more than 1.65% on February 3, the euro is relatively flat against the dollar, up by 25 basis points over the last two weeks. After crashing approximately 10% versus its American counterpart in 2015, the euro has rallied by more than 2.5% over the first six weeks of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said its Consumer Price Index  (CPI) for January increased by 1.4% from the prior 12 months, gaining 0.7% from December's measure. The Core CPI Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also rose by 0.3% from the prior month, considerably above analysts' expectations of a 0.1% gain. On an annual basis, Core CPI increased by 2.2%, also above forecasts of 2.1%.
The headline reading, though, for monthly CPI remained flat, slightly above expectations for a decline of 0.1%. It came as energy prices crashed by nearly 3% on the month, dragged down by a 4.8% decline in monthly gasoline prices. On the upside, the services component surged by 3.0%, led by increases in medical care and prescription drug prices, while rent and owners' equivalent rent also moved higher.
In minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's January meeting, released earlier this week, several dovish members said they wanted to see ""direct evidence"" that long-term inflation was moving toward its objective before raising interest rates again. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's long-term gauge on inflation, has remained below its targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. As such, the members noted that monetary policy was ""less well positioned to respond effectively to shocks that reduce inflation than to upside shocks.""
Though inflation has been restrained by temporary factors from a stronger dollar and the downturn in oil prices, Fed Cleveland president Loretta Mester noted on Friday that long-run inflation expectations have still been ""relatively stable."" In a speech on the economy and monetary policy at the Global Interdependence Center in Sarasota, Florida, Mester said she expects the Fed to continue to raise rates gradually if the economy remains strong.
Meanwhile on Friday evening in Brussels, European Council president Donald Tusk said there is unanimous support for a deal between the U.K. and the EU that would give the United Kingdom ""special status,"" in the European bloc. The deal, which was reached after two days of tense negotiations, ostensibly paves the way for a referendum that could lead to the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.
""I have negotiated a deal to give the U.K. special status in the EU,"" Britain prime minister David Cameron wrote on his Twitter (N:TWTR) account. ""I will be recommending it to Cabinet tomorrow.""
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained one basis point to 1.74%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year lost two basis points to 0.20%. Yields on both 10-year government bonds have fallen by more than 15 basis points over the last year.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.20% to an intraday low of 96.58 before closing at 96.62. For the week, the index rose slightly by 0.45%."

The currency pair traded between 1.1071 and 1.1150, before settling at 1.1104, down 0.15% on the session. At session's lows, the euro fell below 1.11 against the dollar for the first time in two weeks. With the slight losses, the euro posted its fifth straight loss versus its American counterpart and seventh over the last 10 sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The euro hit session lows against the dollar on Thursday in European afternoon trading after the ECB released the minutes from a closely-watched meeting last month. While the ECB's governing council opted to leave interest rates unchanged at the meeting, it sent strong indications that it could approve widespread measures in March aimed at spurring economic growth and boosting stubbornly low inflation. A closer view of the minutes could stoke expectations for further stimulus when the Governing Council convenes for its next monetary policy meeting on March 10.
""It needed to be reaffirmed that, if the Governing Council had to intensify the use of the available range of policy options in order to achieve its price stability mandate, it would not hesitate to do so,"" the ECB said in the minutes.
""Reassurance needed to be given that the Governing Council had a variety of instruments at its disposal to respond to circumstances and that there was no limit to how far it was willing to deploy instruments within its mandate to achieve the objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This would help to anchor inflation expectations and underline the significant differences in the monetary policy cycles between major advanced economies.""
At the same time, the ECB is hoping to avoid the missteps that hampered its progress at a meeting in December when it failed to meet market expectations by approving only limited easing measures with its comprehensive asset purchasing program. As a result, the euro enjoyed its strongest one-day performance against the dollar in more than a year and government bond prices tumbled.
Across the pond, investors also reacted to the release of January minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee over the previous session. The minutes from the Fed's first meeting since its historic rate decision in December, depict a divided committee torn on the timing of the pace of tightening needed to help fulfill its dual mandate. While several participants noted that further tightening delays could potentially lead to excessively high inflation, other members expressed concern that premature rate hikes could dampen progress in the economy and labor markets, the minutes showed. Long-term inflation has remained below the FOMC's targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years.
In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 and 0.50%.
The CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch tool increased the probability of one rate hike in 2016 to 33.9% on Thursday, up from an average of 15.1% a day earlier. The odds of a 25 basis point increase in March are still slim. Currently, there is a 4.1% chance of a Fed hike next month, according to the CME Group, down from nearly 30% a month earlier.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 97.09, before closing at 96.84, down 0.04%.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1106 and 1.1179, before settling at 1.1126, down 0.0011 or 0.10% on the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in each of the last four sessions and five times in the last six trading days. Over the last month of trading, the euro is still up by nearly 2% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
When the Federal Open Market Committee last met three weeks ago, widespread volatility in global financial markets and sluggish inflation expectations, prompted the U.S. central bank to leave its path for future interest rate hikes unchanged, the minutes from its January meeting showed on Wednesday. 
In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 and 0.50%. 
""Many participants indicated that their assessment of the balance of risks associated with the timing of the beginning of policy normalization had inclined them toward keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for a longer time,"" the FOMC said in the minutes. ""Some observed that, even with these risks taken into consideration, the federal funds rate may have already been kept at its lower bound for a sufficient length of time, and that it might be appropriate to begin policy firming in the near term.""
Before its interest rate decision, the FOMC said its staff reviewed prior cases in the U.S. and abroad where central banks embarked on a tightening cycle after a lengthy period of maintaining low interest rates to help guide its policy. While several participants noted that further tightening delays could potentially lead to excessively high inflation, other members expressed concern that premature rate hikes could dampen progress in the economy and labor markets, the minutes showed. 
Also on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis president Neel Kashkari indicated that a March rate hike will still be on the table if the economy continued to grow moderately and inflation showed signs of firming. 
""Since January, the data has been mixed. We’re going to keep watching the data and decide in March or beyond when is the right time to move”, Kashkari told CNBC. 
As a result, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch increased the probability of one rate hike by the Fed in 2016 to 28.3%. By comparison, the odds of a single rate hike this year hovered around 11% on Tuesday, the CME Group said. 
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 96.65, before closing at 96.88.

Investors continued to digest dovish comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on the strong possibility that its Governing Council will approve further easing measures when it holds its next monetary policy meeting in March. Speaking before the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels on Monday, Draghi indicated that the ECB will not show reluctance to act if persistent financial market turmoil or low energy prices continue to impact inflation expectations.
Last month, an ECB survey of 57 economists showed that annual inflation expectations for 2016 fell to 0.7%, down 0.3% from previous forecasts three months earlier. While forecasters anticipate that inflation in the euro zone will increase in each of the following two years, it is still expected to remain below the ECB's targeted goal of 2% through the end of 2018.
Crude prices have hovered around 12-year lows over the last two months, while euro zone banking stocks have tumbled in recent weeks amid concerns related to a rout in the high-yield sector and the ramifications of the adoption of negative interest rate policies at major central banks across the continent.
""We will examine the strength of the pass-through of low imported inflation to domestic wage and price formation and to inflation expectations. This will depend on the size and the persistence of the fall in oil and commodity prices and the incidence of second-round effects on domestic wages and prices,"" Draghi said.
""In light of the recent financial turmoil, we will analyze the state of transmission of our monetary impulses by the financial system and in particular by banks. If either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act.""
When the Federal Open Market Committee releases the minutes from its January meeting on Wednesday afternoon, investors could receive further indications on the pace of tightening the U.S. central bank will embark on over the next several months. While Janet Yellen testified last week that it is unlikely that economic conditions will force the FOMC to cut interest rates, the Fed chair did not take negative interest rates off the table.
In late-January, the Bank of Japan spooked global markets by pushing rates below zero for the first time in history. With the ECB's deposit rate already in subzero territory, it marked the first time on record that two of the three top central banks in the world offered negative interest rates simultaneously.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields.

USD/JPY rose 0.63% to 113.93, extending its pullback from last week’s 15-month trough of 110.96.
The yen weakened after Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said “excessive currency volatility is undesirable”, referring to strong gains in the yen last week that sent stocks tumbling.
He added that Tokyo would take appropriate action in the exchange rate market as needed.
The Nikkei ended up 7.16%, shrugging off data showing that Japan’s economy contracted by a larger than forecast 1.4% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.
European markets followed Asian markets higher in early trade, with banking shares rebounding.
Bank shares fell sharply last week amid fears over the effects of negative interest rates, while ongoing concerns over slowing global growth also hit market sentiment.
The euro was lower against the dollar, with EUR/USD down 0.44% at 1.1205, moving further away from last week’s three-and-a-half month highs of 1.1375.
The single currency pushed higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY easing up 0.16% to 127.68, recovering from last Thursday’s two-and-a-half year trough of 125.76.
The Australian dollar shrugged off weak Chinese trade data, rising 0.55% to 0.7146.
The kiwi was also higher, with NZD/USD up 0.66% at 0.6667.
Chinese imports and exports fell far more than expected in January, according to data released on Monday, indicating that trade in the world’s second-largest economy got off to a shaky start in 2016.
But China’s central bank fixed the yuan at a stronger level on Monday and central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said there was no basis for the currency to keep depreciating.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.40% at 96.37, moving further back from Thursday’s three-and-a-half month lows of 95.28.

""For a start, Chinese trade growth is notoriously volatile during the first quarter due to the shifting timing of Lunar New Year which makes the monthly data less comparable with the previous year. Admittedly, we had expected the earlier timing of Lunar New Year compared with 2015 to have provided a seasonal boost to exports last month given that more of the pre-holiday rush to meet orders should have taken place in January this year. That said, the impact of these seasonal distortions can be difficult to predict,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients after the data.
""Secondly, efforts to arbitrage the gap between the offshore and onshore exchange rate appear to have inflated export growth in December. As such, the slowdown in export growth in January may partly reflect the easing of this (artificial) boost to shipments – the gap between the onshore and offshore rates narrowed last month. In a similar vein, capital outflows disguised as trade flows are likely to have inflated imports at the end of last year. With policymakers having recently begun cracking down on such illicit flows, headline import growth may have been hit as a result.""
Earlier, Japan's GDP contracted 0.4% quarter-on- quarter, or an annualized 1.4%, in the fourth quarter, hit by sluggish consumer spending amid a slow wage recovery and uncertain growth prospects.

1020,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2016 08:50PM ET</span>","USD/JPY halts four-day skid, as Nikkei caps worst week in seven years","Investing.com -- The dollar rose sharply against the yen on Friday, halting a four-day losing streak where USD/JPY fell nearly 4%, as panicked investors sought shelter in the safe-haven Japanese currency.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 111.72 and 113.55 before closing at 113.22, up 0.71% on the session. It came one day after the Yen surged to fresh 15-month highs against the greenback at 110.98, as oil prices plummeted to 12-year lows and investors departed from their positions in risky, high-yield bonds. Over the first two weeks of February, the dollar closed higher against the yen in just two of 10 sessions, plunging more than 6.5% during that span.
USD/JPY likely gained support at 110.98, the low from February 11 and was met with resistance at 123.67, the high from Dec. 3.
The dollar has fallen steadily since surging 2% against the yen on January 29, when the Bank of Japan roiled global currency markets by unexpectedly lowering interest rates into negative territory. At the time, BOJ president Haruhiko Kuroda cited widespread volatility in China, the emerging markets and the global financial markets overall as primary factors for the unprecedented move. The decision garnered significant controversy as four of nine BOJ opposed the move, minutes from the meeting showed.
Over the last two weeks, the yen carry trade has steadily fallen out of favor, amid concerns of falling profits among Japanese banks, the continuing commodity slump and uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve's current tightening cycle. As a result, the waning yen carry trade has provided significant downside pressure against the dollar.
With the European Central Bank's deposit rate already in negative territory, the BOJ's decision marks the first time two of the world's top three central banks have held rates below zero simultaneously. Over the last several months, a host of central banks have adopted Negative Interest Rate Policies (NIRP) as a tool for staving off deflation and bolstering economic growth. Under the policy, central banks charge financial institutions for parking excessive reserves at their banks as a way of spurring lending. Critics of the practice argue that it may either severely restrain the profits of major banks or force them to pass the costs off to customers by increasing fees.
While testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Fed chair Janet Yellen attempted to soothe markets by hinting that any rate cuts by the U.S. central bank in the coming months are unlikely. Yellen, though, backtracked on Thursday when she told the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed has not taken negative interest rates off the table.
The stronger yen has weighed heavily on Japan's top domestic auto stocks, such as Toyota, which earn most of their profits abroad. On Friday, the Nikkei 225 plummeted nearly 5%, capping its worst week in more than seven years."
1021,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2016 06:04PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls mildly, as investors continue to fret about negative rates","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell modestly on Friday, retreating from three-month highs reached in the prior session, as currency traders continued to assess the risks associated with negative interest rate policies one day after Sweden's Central Bank unexpectedly lowered their rates deeper below zero. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1214 and 1.1333 before settling at 1.1255, down 0.0061 or 0.54% on the session. Despite the slight losses, EUR/USD has still closed higher in seven of the last 10 sessions and 11 of the last 15. After nearly slipping below 1.08 at the end of last month, the euro is up by nearly 4% against its American counterpart in February. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The euro posted a rare losing session, as banking stocks in the euro zone rallied more than 4% after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG NA O.N. (N:DB) announced that it will buy back $5.4 billion of its senior debt in an effort to reduce panic among investors. It came days after credit default swaps on the German bank's junior bonds surged more than 10% in a single session to reach its highest level on record. The European bond market has come under intense pressure in recent weeks from crashing oil prices, outflows from sovereign-wealth funds and strong indications that the European Central Bank will lower interest rates deeper into negative when its Governing Council holds its next monetary policy meeting in March. Entering Friday's session, banking stocks in the euro zone had crashed more than 25% since the start of the year. 
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen capped a two-day appearance before Congress on Thursday by testifying that the U.S. central bank has not taken negative interest rates off the table, even as the prospects of cutting rates remains unlikely. Over the last several months, a host of central banks have adopted Negative Interest Rate Policies (NIRP) as a tool for staving off deflation and bolstering economic growth. Under the policy, central banks charge financial institutions for parking excessive reserves at their banks as a way of spurring lending. Critics of the practice argue that it may either severely restrain the profits of major banks or force them to pass the costs off to customers by increasing fees.
As banking stocks around the world have fallen steeply this week, investors have piled into safe-havens such as gold, U.S. treasuries and the Japanese yen. 
In late-January, the Bank of Japan rattled global markets with a surprising decision to implement a negative interest rate policy for the first time in central bank history. With the European Central Bank's deposit rate already in negative territory, it marked the first time two of the world's top three central banks held rates below zero at the same time. Economists have also explored whether central banks in China, Australia and Norway could join Sweden and Denmark in adopting the policy.
EUR/USD is only down by 0.06% from its level last February, when investors geared up for the launch of the ECB's ambitious €60 billion a month asset purchasing program. In 2015, the euro fell by approximately 10% against the dollar. 
Yellen also emphasized in her testimony that the Fed will not take a ""preset path"" for normalizing policy during its first tightening cycle in nearly a decade. Following the Federal Open Market Committee's historic rate hike in December, the FOMC sent strong indications that it could raise short-term interest rates as much as four times this year. While Yellen did not address whether the FOMC will hold short-term interest rates steady at its March meeting, there is a strong probability the Fed will raise rates fewer than two times in 2016, according to current market expectations. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year surged more than 10 basis points to close at 1.746%. On Thursday, yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds fell as low as 1.53%, their lowest level since April, 2012.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.45% to an intraday high of 96.25, before closing at 95.99. The index is still down more than 3.7% since the BOJ's rate decision on January 29. "

He later added that the cash rate is unlikely to go higher anytime soon and then suggested the question is whether it would go lower than the current record low 2%.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1274 and 1.1376 before settling at 1.1323, up 0.0049 or 0.35% on the session. At session highs, the euro moved to fresh three-month highs against the dollar. EUR/USD has now closed higher in 12 of the last 14 sessions and is up by nearly 4.5% since the end of last month.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
In Europe a host of major banking stocks fell precipitously, extending heavy losses from earlier in the week, after Sweden's Central Bank unexpectedly lowered its repo rate deeper into negative territory on Thursday. The move exacerbates concerns that other central banks in the euro zone could follow suit, amid low employment, weak economic growth and stubbornly low inflation. More broadly, numerous indices throughout Europe closed down between 2 and 3%, while the Euro Stoxx 50 fell to its lowest since late-2013.
On Monday, stocks in the euro zone fell to fresh 16 month lows as the cost of subordinate debt of European financial firms soared more than 12% on the session to its highest level in nearly three years. It came as crude futures slipped below $30 a barrel, placing further pressure on banks and the high-yield market. Last month, the Bank of Japan rattled global markets with a surprising decision to implement a negative interest rate policy for the first time in central bank history. With the European Central Bank's deposit rate already in negative territory, it marked the first time two of the world's top three central banks held rates below zero simultaneous.
The debate on whether central banks should adopt a negative interest rate policy was thrust back into focus on Wednesday when Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen testified on Capitol Hill that she is unsure whether the U.S. central bank has the legal authority to push rates below zero. While Yellen testified that she is ""not aware"" of any restrictions that would prevent the Fed from offering negative rates, she does not expect that it will be forced to cut rates anytime soon. At a historic meeting in mid-December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade by lifting the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 and 0.50%.
On Thursday, Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee that although the Fed has not taken prospects for a negative interest rate policy off the table, she reiterated that it is unlikely the FOMC will lower short-term rates given its current economic outlook.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.40% to an intraday low of 95.28, before closing slightly higher at 95.64. Since the FOMC released its latest monetary policy statement on Jan. 27, the dollar has fallen by nearly 4%.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rallied late in Thursday's session to close at 1.66%, up one basis point. Earlier on Thursday, bond yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell to 1.53%, their lowest level since April, 2012. Yields on the Germany 10-Year lost five basis points to 0.18%."

Yellen, in testimony before a congressional committee on Wednesday said there are good reasons to believe the U.S. will stay on a path of moderate growth that will allow the Fed to pursue ""gradual"" adjustments to monetary policy.
But she also acknowledged risks facing the U.S. economy from tightening financial conditions driven by falling stock prices and uncertainty over China.
USD/JPY fell to lows of 111.00 overnight, the weakest level since October 2014 and was last at 111.33, down 1.75% for the day.
The dollar’s steep drop against the yen was amplified by thin trading conditions, with markets in Japan and China closed for public holidays.
The dollar is now down almost 8% against the yen from the six-week high of 121.68 reached on January 29, following the Bank of Japan’s shock decision to adopt negative interest rates.
The greenback fell to three-and-a-half month lows against a basket of the other major currencies.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, hit lows of 95.40, the weakest since October 22 and was last at 95.61.
The low-yielding euro was higher against the dollar, with EUR/USD at 1.1327, not far from three-and-a-half month highs of 1.1354 set earlier.
But the single currency fell to its lowest level in more than two-and-a-half years against the stronger yen, with EUR/JPY down 1.5% at 126.07.
The dollar was at four-month lows against the Swiss franc, which tends to be bought by investors in times of risk aversion, with USD/CHF down 0.67% at 0.9672."

1039,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 10, 2016 05:43PM ET</span>",EUR/USD ticks up after Yellen's comments put March hike into question,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD inched up on Wednesday on a volatile day of trading, after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen provided few indications on the timing of the Fed's next interest rate move in guarded testimony on Capitol Hill.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1161 and 1.1315 before settling at 1.1291, up 0.0003 or 0.02% on the session. The euro staged a late rally against the dollar to extend a three-day winning streak. EUR/USD has now closed higher in 11 of the last 13 sessions and is up by nearly 4% since the end of last month. In Tuesday's session, the euro posted sharp gains to close at its highest level versus the greenback since late-October.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
While Yellen noted on Wednesday that widespread market volatility and a weak dollar continued to pose growth risks to the U.S. economy, she appeared confident that inflation will move back toward the Fed's targeted goal of 2%, while reiterating that the labor market is close to full employment. Yellen's semi-annual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee could be interpreted as neither dovish, nor hawkish, providing further ambiguity on whether the Fed will raise short-term interest rates before the end of the summer.
Yellen's testimony marked her first appearance on Capitol Hill since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ended a seven-year zero interest policy late last year. At a historic meeting in mid-December, the FOMC raised short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade by lifting the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 and 0.50%. The FOMC followed by leaving the target rate unchanged at a meeting in late-January.
In her testimony, Yellen emphasized that the Fed's monetary policy cycle is not on a preset course, as further interest rate decisions will continue to depend on incoming economic data over the next several months. Yellen also noted that the neutral nominal federal funds rate, or the rate which is neither expansionary or contractionary if the economy is operating at its full potential, is ""currently low by historical standards."" Yellen cited a range of economic headwinds for restraining the rate including: the appreciation of the dollar, limited credit availability for borrowers and weak growth abroad.
Moving forward, Yellen stressed that diminishing slack in the labor market and a bottoming of oil price declines could help move inflation back toward the Fed's long-term targeted goal of 2%. Core PCE Inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, currently hovers at 1.4%, considerably below the FOMC's objective.
""In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well,"" Yellen testified.
Markets interpreted Yellen's comments as fairly dovish, as the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch lowered the probability of a March interest rate hike to 0% on Wednesday, down from 4.2% a day earlier. The CME Group also lowered the odds of a December rate hike to 17.3%, from Tuesday's level of 20.8%. Any rate hikes this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.35% to an intraday high of 96.77, before falling slightly back at the close. The index tumbled by more than 1% on Tuesday to an intraday low of 95.68, its lowest level since late-October. Since the FOMC released its latest monetary policy statement on Jan. 27, the dollar has fallen by more than 2.5%.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2016 07:41AM ET</span>",Dollar fails to find foothold as market awaits Yellen,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar struggled to climb off 3-1/2-month lows on Wednesday as worries over a global economic slowdown weighed and traders waited for more tips on the likely course of U.S. interest rates from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.
The greenback has shed more than 3 percent over the past two weeks as expectations of a 2016 rate rise have all but vanished. Concern over sliding commodity prices, a slowing Chinese economy and the health of European banks have also dampened dollar demand in favor of safe-haven assets such as the yen.
Despite a shock move from the Bank of Japan to adopt negative interest rates two weeks ago, the yen hit a 15-month high of 114.05 per dollar <JPY=> on Tuesday and was up 0.2 percent on the day at 114.89 yen on Wednesday. It has gained more than 6 percent since an initial fall on the BOJ's move.
Currency strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) said in a research note that the risk of a dollar fall to 110 yen had increased. This week's European bank sell-off and widening credit spreads had spurred demand for the Japanese currency, they said, but the ""waning power of policy"" had also contributed.
""Before the BOJ's January meeting, we had thought that the 'cost of acting' outweighed the 'cost of not acting', in a sense that any...impact of additional easing risks being absorbed by volatile market conditions caused by global factors, which would signal the limit of BOJ's ammunition,"" they wrote.
""That risk has now shown up.""
The options market suggests huge demand for yen calls, or right to buy the yen. Risk reversal spreads, which measure the price gap between the yen calls and yen puts, are at their widest in favor of calls since 2010 <JPY1MRR=FN>.
The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies at 96.056 (DXY), having touched 95.663 on Tuesday, its lowest since October.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) currency strategist Michael Sneyd, in London, said Yellen - the text for whose congressional testimony is due at 8.30 a.m. ET - would be unlikely to provide any kind of rebound for the dollar.
""The most likely is quite a balanced assessment, in which she says the U.S. economy is doing well, but acknowledges that the market hasn't taken this first rate hike too well and that this has led to a tightening of monetary conditions,"" he said.
""It seems we're likely to remain in this regime where the dollar continues to lose ground against the euro and the yen.""
In times of economic stress, countries or regions running current account surpluses, as are Japan, the euro zone and Switzerland, are seen as safer compared with those that have deficits and rely on foreign capital to finance the gap. The United States and Britain fall into the latter category.

AUD/USD traded at 0.7066, down 0.07%, while USD/JPY changed hands at 115.11, down 0.01%.
In Australia the Westpac Consumer Sentiment gauge rose to 4.2% from a drop of 3.5% in the previous month and beat expectations of a 1.0% fall.
Australia also reported that HIA New Home Sales for December jumped 6.0% month-on-month, after a fall of 2.7% in November.
In Japan, the CGPI (corporate goods price index) for January fell 0.9% month-on-month, more than the 0.7% drop seen, and on a year-on-year pace of down 3.1%.
Lower producer prices help cut costs for businesses and households but they also exert downward pressures on consumer prices and could further delay the timing of boosting inflation to 2% from around zero. The BoJ has said producer prices are expected to ""continue declining for the time being, reflecting movements in international commodity prices.""

1050,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 09, 2016 05:55PM ET</span>",EUR/USD surges to 3-month high ahead of Yellen's Capitol Hill appearance,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged nearly 1% on Tuesday, jumping to its highest level in three months, as the dollar continued its prolonged slump ahead of a highly-anticipated appearance by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1163 and 1.1338 before settling at 1.1290, up 0.0103 or 0.91% on the session. At session highs, the euro reached its highest level since October 21. Since slipping below 1.08 in late-January the euro has soared nearly 4% against the dollar. During that span, EUR/USD has closed higher in 10 of the last 12 sessions. The euro opened 2016 just below 1.09 against its American counterpart after plunging nearly 10%, a year earlier.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
When Yellen testifies before the U.S. House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, it will mark her first public appearance in 55 days and her first since the Fed abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy in December. Last month, as expected, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current rate between 0.25 and 0.50%. 
The current climate in global financial markets has changed dramatically since Yellen last spoke publicly before Christmas. Over the last two months, oil has plunged to 12-year lows below $30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost approximately 1,600 points and U.S. fourth quarter GDP slumped to 0.7%, considerably below initial expectations of 2%. Arguably, conditions are even worse abroad. In China, GDP growth expanded at its lowest level in a quarter century last year, while in the euro zone stocks plummeted to a 16-month low on Monday, as the financial sector continues to recoil in large part due to the crippling effects of negative interest rates.
Yellen could address prospects of softer U.S. economic growth, tighter financial conditions and troubles abroad in the first of her two-day appearance on Capitol Hill. The most pressing issue could be the Fed's median forecast for the Fed Funds Rate, which suggests that the U.S. central bank could approve up to four rate hikes this year. While the general consensus among analysts is that Yellen could offer concessions on the pace of its tightening, she could also vigorously defend the Fed's decision to normalize monetary policy in mid-December. Before Yellen begins her testimony at 10 a.m. EST, the Fed will release its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. Legislators who parse through the fine print, could receive critical updates from the Fed on the amount of liquidity in bond markets and the levels of slack in the labor market.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 1% on Tuesday to an intraday low of 95.68, before closing at 96.04. At session lows, the index fell to its lowest level since late-October. The dollar has tumbled nearly 3.5% since the FOMC released its latest monetary policy statement on Jan. 27.
Also on Tuesday,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG NA O.N. (N:DB) attempted to soothe investor sentiment after the second consecutive day of sharp declines in euro zone banking stocks. Deutsche Bank is also considering an emergency bond buyback program, according to the Financial Times, to repurchase several billion euros of its senior debt in an effort to prop up the value of its declining securities.
USD/JPY fell 0.45% to 115.14, rallying slightly after falling to a 15-month low at 114.24. It came after Japan became the first major economy to see borrowing rates for its 10-Year debt fall into negative territory.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year lost two basis points to 1.73%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year gained two basis points to 0.23%. Government bond yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries have fallen nearly 40 basis points over the last month."

1071,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2016 05:50PM ET</span>","EUR/USD recoils from 3-month high, as Fed rate hike comes back into play","Investing.com -- EUR/USD retreated from three-month highs on Friday while halting a four-day winning streak, as a relatively strong U.S. jobs report shifted market expectations for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate hike into 2016.
The currency pair traded between 1.1109 and 1.1246 before settling at 1.1159, down 0.0048 or 0.43% on the session. Previously, EUR/USD surged more than 2.5% since Wednesday completing its strongest two-day rally since the August flash crash. After falling approximately 10% against its U.S. counterpart in 2015, the euro is now up nearly 3% versus the dollar over the first five weeks of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said nonfarm payrolls increased by 151,000 in January, falling considerably from a downwardly revised 262,000 in December. The sharp declines were blamed in large part to unseasonably warm temperatures over the previous month, which created an unanticipated demand for labor in the construction industry. After two months of robust gains, the headline dipped under 200,000 for the first time since September.
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, inched down 0.1% to 4.9%, falling to its lowest level since February, 2008. The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader gauge of the national employment situation, remained unchanged at 9.9%, one-tenth above its November low when it fell its lowest level since May, 2008. The reading, which measures the total level of unemployed workers plus those marginally attached to the labor force, stood at 11.1% last October. The indicator also accounts for workers who are no longer looking for a job, but have looked for one over the last 12 months.
By comparison, the alternative measure of underemployment peaked at 18% in January, 2010, as the nation continued to recover from the Financial Crisis. The U-6 rate is a preferred measure of unemployment by Fed chair Janet Yellen as she assesses the strength of the U.S. labor market.
The strength in the report lies in the average wages category where hourly earnings jumped by 0.5%, amid major increases in state minimum wage floors in numerous regions throughout the country. On an annual basis, wages are up by 2.5% from their January, 2015 level.
An increase in wage-push inflation could be viewed as a signal from the Fed that prices throughout the economy are ready to move upward. Last month, Core PCE inflation came in at 1.4%, significantly below the U.S. central bank's targeted objective of 2%. The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation.
As sluggish inflation remains low, the Fed is wary of potentially triggering a deflationary spiral by approving further rate hikes. In December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. While the Fed had signaled that it could hike rates as much as four times this year, the U.S. central bank indicated last month that it could proceed more gradually if the global economy continued to struggle and long-term inflation projections remained far below its target.
Following the release, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch lowered the probability that the FOMC will leave interest rates unchanged this year to 56.6%. A day earlier, investors believed there was a 66.1% chance the Fed would not approve a single rate hike in 2016.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.60% to an intraday high of 97.29. Previously, the index had slumped over 3% this week as investors braced for a disappointing employment report. The dollar was on pace for its worst week since 2009, before Friday's rebound.
Major central banks have several weeks to examine incoming global data before the European Central Bank holds its next monetary policy meeting on March 10. Another positive U.S. employment report in February could compel the ECB to refrain from pushing its deposit rate deeper into negative territory.
USD/JPY closed slightly higher on Friday at 116.89, ending a four-day skid. The greenback had tumbled nearly 3.50% against the yen, after reaching a 2016-yearly high last Friday in the wake of a shocking decision by the Bank of Japan to launch a negative rate policy.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2016 03:57AM ET</span>",Dollar in doldrums as heads for worst week since 2009,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar inched up from a 2-1/2-month low on Friday but was on track for its heaviest weekly loss since 2009, as investors awaited U.S. employment data for justification of the view that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates in 2016. 
The dollar has shed almost 3 percent against a basket of major currencies (DXY) since Monday as expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates at least once this year have all but evaporated amid signs of domestic weakness and broader concerns over global growth. 
It steadied on Friday, along with most major currencies, as markets held fire before the non-farm payrolls report - usually the most closely watched number in the monthly data calendar  - due at 1330 GMT.
The dollar index was up 0.2 percent by 0830 GMT at 96.651, having traded as low as 96.239 on Thursday, its weakest since late October.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Thulan Nguyen, in Frankfurt, said a weak payrolls figure would be unlikely to drive the dollar down much further as it had already fallen so much in recent days.
""There is a general scepticism towards a proper rate hike cycle by the Fed – that's been driving down the dollar (but)there's probably not that much room left for dollar weakness,"" she said. ""A better labor market report could bring back some confidence in the rate cycle."" 
The euro edged down 0.2 percent <EUR=> to $1.1190, but for the week was on track for a more than 3 percent gain - its biggest since October 2011. 
That was despite European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi saying on Thursday that the risk of acting too late on ultra-low inflation was greater than that of acting too early, suggesting more policy easing may be needed.
Against the yen, the dollar traded flat at 116.80 yen, close to a two-week low of 116.525 <JPY=> and having erased an upward spike triggered a week ago by the Bank of Japan's move to adopt negative interest rates.
The nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show that employers added 190,000 jobs in January, according to a Reuters poll. But figures on Thursday showed U.S. jobless claims rose more than expected last week, suggesting labour conditions could be weaker than many believe.

""The charts suggest the short dollar/yen trade is still the advantageous trend trade, but with the non-farm payrolls tonight this data point may give a better entry point to sell strength in dollar/yen,"" Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note to clients.

1084,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2016 05:48PM ET</span>","EUR/USD soars to fresh 3-month highs, ahead of critical U.S. jobs report","Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged on Thursday to fresh 3-month highs, extending sharp gains from the previous session, as currency traders continued to gear up for the likelihood of a disappointing U.S. jobs report which could cap a stellar week for the euro. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1070 and 1.1238, before settling at 1.1210, up 0.0106 or 1.04% on the session. The euro soared above 1.12 against the dollar for the first time since late-October, then held onto the gains to post its strongest two-day move since the August flash crash. EUR/USD has closed higher in each of the last four sessions, jumping more than 3.3% from last Friday's lows after the Bank of Japan propped up the dollar with a shocking decision to push interest rates into negative territory.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Initial U.S. jobless claims last week, according to government reports released on Thursday, rose 8,000 to 285,000 for the week ending on Jan. 30, slightly above consensus' estimates of 280,000. New claims continued to trend higher, as the four-week average increased to 284,750, up approximately by 5,000 from the same level a month ago. While continuing claims fell considerably to 2.255 million for the week ending on Jan. 23, the four-week average moved higher for the fourth consecutive week.
The downbeat data will likely temper analysts' optimism heading into Friday morning's U.S. jobs report for the month of January. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to report that nonfarm payrolls increased by 188,000 in January, falling sharply from December's robust gain of 292,000. It would mark the first month that the figure dipped under 200,000 since September. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is expected to remain unchanged at 5.0%.
Most economists, though, are more concerned with the pace of wage growth amid a pattern of muted hourly earnings over the last year. A major uptick in earnings could bolster wage push inflation and help the Federal Reserve move closer to fulfilling both legs of its dual mandate. Although Core PCE Inflation ticked up by 0.1 to 1.4% in January, it still remains considerably below the Fed's targeted objective of 2.0%. The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation.
A dismal jobs report could persuade hawkish members of the Federal Reserve to act more cautiously in advocating swift policy normalization this year. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president William Dudley noted that the  ""tightening of financial conditions"" since the Federal Open Market Committee began raising rates in December has become a ""matter of considerable concern,"" to the U.S. central bank. There is now a 69.4% probability that the Fed will not raise rates in 2016, according to the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch tool, up from 39.6% last month. 
Following the surprise move by the BOJ last week, two of the top three central banks are now offering negative interest rates for the first time on record. In effect, the BOJ's decision helps the Fed tighten its monetary policy cycle without raising interest rates. The European Central Bank could lower its deposit rate deeper into negative territory when its Governing Council meets next in March.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell to a fresh 3-month low on Thursday before rallying slightly to close at 96.51.

1088,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Feb 04, 2016 03:50AM ET</span>",Franc Remains Weak As SNB Assesses Poor Economy,"By Jarratt Davis
The Swiss franc remains a fundamentally bearish currency due to interest rates of -0.75% and inflation falling further into negative territory. As always the SNB's focus is the exchange rate with the euro and President Jordan has routinely used speaking opportunities to state that the franc is overvalued.
Both the USDCHF and EURCHF exchange rates rallied nearly 400 pips during the first month of 2016. This is partly attributable to dollar and euro strength across the board - whereby the dollar has been boosted by policy fundamentals and the euro by risk-off sentiment - but the the moves are also due to franc weakness as some commentators see the prospect of further easing by the SNB as a more likely option since the January 21 ECB meeting where Draghi indicated further expansion of the Eurozone's QE program.
Further easing by the ECB is likely to put pressure on the euro and hence weaken the EURCHF, which is the SNB's primary concern as it makes Swiss exports to Europe less competitive. If the ECB eases further and the EURCHF declines, then the SNB may consider their own easing program or a move further into negative rates or to widen the scope of the current negative rate application. President Jordan has routinely used speaking opportunities to state that the franc is overvalued
Although the SNB may be forced to take this action to buoy the EURCHF exchange rate, and boost inflation, in the future, recent franc weakness means they are not currently in an urgent position to act, since the EURCHF is at the highest level since the removal of the floor on January 15, 2015.
On December 10, the SNB's Q4 Monetary Policy Assessment saw no change in the -1.25% to -0.25% target corridor for 3-month CHF Libor. The deposit rate was also left unchanged at -0.75%. Heading into the release there was some speculation that the SNB would further cut rates, or add to their current program in response to recent ECB actions. However, while the ECB extended their current program, and cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points, the SNB stopped short of expanding their current asset purchase program. This less aggressive approach by the ECB allowed the SNB to hold policy steady, however further easing by the ECB this year may encourage the SNB to follow suit.
The Consumer Price Index for January saw prices fall -1.3% compared to a year ago and a further -0.4% for the month. With m/m readings heading further into deflation, the SNB may need to act to try to boost inflation.
Third quarter GDP, released December 1, was stagnant at 0%, and 0.80% since a year prior, held back by weak performance in the energy, construction and financial sector.
Retail sales for November, released January 11, saw declines of -2.1% y/y - the worst reading in eight months - while PPI for December, released January 19, declined -0.4% for the month. These lacklustre figures paint a weakening picture for the Swiss economy and have contributed to the franc depreciation seen throughout the first month of 2016.
The franc is likely to remain under pressure as long as the Swiss economy has deflation and low economic growth. The currency can however rally on safe-haven flows. The market will be looking out for any further easing of monetary policy by the SNB throughout the coming months.

1093,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2016 05:41PM ET</span>","EUR/USD surges to 3-month high, amid further signs of delayed Fed hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD enjoyed its strongest one-day move in two months, surging to its highest level since late-October, as the dollar continued to retreat from last week's Bank of Japan-driven rally, amid signals of slowing economic growth and decelerated job gains in the labor market.
The weak data comes ahead of the release of a highly-anticipated January U.S. jobs reports on Friday. A poor reading could compel the Federal Reserve to slow its pace of tightening, as it weighs whether to raise short-term interest rates in March. the The euro, meanwhile, could be the chief beneficiary of a dovish Fed, as the European Central Bank mulls a decision to push interest rates deeper into negative territory.
On Wednesday, the currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0904 and 1.1145 before settling at 1.1098, up 0.089 or 1.64% on the session. The euro has now closed higher against the dollar in seven of the last eight sessions. After ending last year below 1.09, EUR/USD has gained more than 2% since January 1.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
On Wednesday morning, the ADP Research Institute said in its January employment report that private payrolls last month rose by 205,000. While the figure came in above consensus estimates of 190,000, it fell considerably below December gains of 257,000. The ADP employment report is widely viewed as a precursor for Friday's government report from the U.S. Department of Labor. 
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 188,000 in January, falling sharply from December's robust gain of 292,000. It would mark the first month that the figure dipped under 200,000 since September. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is expected to remain unchanged at 5.0%. Many economists are more concerned with the pace of wage growth amid soft hourly earnings over the last year. A major uptick in earnings could bolster wage push inflation and help the Federal Reserve move closer to fulfilling both legs of its dual mandate. 
Although Core PCE Inflation ticked up by 0.1 to 1.4% in January, it still remains considerably below the Fed's targeted objective of 2.0%. The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation. Separately, the Institute of Supply Management said Wednesday morning that its Non-Manufacturing Index last month fell sharply by more than 2 points to 53.5, far below consensus forecasts for a 55.5 reading. Major declines in output and employment growth pushed the index to its lowest level in 23 month. The survey accounts for roughly 90% of the U.S. economy. 
Further signs of subdued growth in the economy and sluggish inflationary pressures could convince the Fed to delay its next interest rate hike beyond the first quarter. After tumbling approximately 5% in January, the major U.S. indices are coming off their worst month to start a year since the Financial Crisis. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year, meanwhile, slumped to 10-month lows on Wednesday at 1.793%, before recovering to close at 1.883%, up three basis points. 
""The tightening of financial conditions that has taken place since the Fed began raising short-term rates in mid-December is a matter of considerable concern to the Fed,"" Federal Reserve Bank of New York president William Dudley told Market News on Tuesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, plummeted by more than 1.65% on Wednesday to an intraday low of 96.89 before rebounding slightly to close at 97.25. The dollar has slumped approximately 2.4% since reaching a two-week high last Friday, after the Bank of Japan bolstered the greenback with a surprising decision to push interest rates into negative territory.
With the surprise move, two of the top three central banks are now offering negative interest rates for the first time on record. In effect, the BOJ's decision helps the Fed tighten its monetary policy cycle without raising interest rates. "

Earlier in Australia, the AIG services index rose 2.1 points to 48.4 for January.
In New Zealand, the unemployment rate dropped sharply to 5.3% from an expected 6.1% rate.
The drop was the subject of some assessment by Capital Economics in A Feb. 3 note to clients that said it cuts the chance of a rate cut going forward.
""The startling plunge in the unemployment rate in New Zealand in the fourth quarter of last year, to 5.3% from 6.0% in the third quarter, decreases the chances that the RBNZ will reduce interest rates further.
""The main reason, however, why the unemployment rate fell so far was because the labour force increased by just 5,000. That followed an unusually weak -9,000 decline in the third quarter and is odd when we know that net migration has remained close to record highs. The circle can be squared because once again the number of people classed as “not in the labour force” rose by 14,000, largely due to 31,500 people retiring.""
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was quoted at 98.87.
Overnight, the dollar remained moderately lower against the other major currencies on Tuesday, as oil prices resumed their downward trend and as concerns over global economic growth persisted.

1105,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 02, 2016 05:57PM ET</span>","EUR/USD continues hot streak, amid dovish hints of delayed Fed rate hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose modestly on Tuesday to continue its recent hot streak, as investors continued to digest dovish comments from an influential Federal Reserve policymaker on the increased possibility of a delayed interest rate hike from the U.S. central bank.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0815 and 1.094, before settling at 1.0918, up 0.0023 or 0.21% on the session. The euro has now closed higher against the dollar in each of the last two sessions and six of its last seven trading days. On the new year, however, the pair is still relatively flat, as the euro is up by roughly 0.50% against its American counterpart since January 1.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Tuesday, investors continued to react to a closely watched speech by Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer on the possibility that the Federal Open Market Committee could delay its next interest rate hike beyond the first quarter. At an address before the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, Fischer noted that further declines in oil prices and a persistently strong dollar could suggest that inflation will remain lower than the Fed previously anticipated. Fischer eventually expects inflationary pressures to rise once temporary factors from the oil downturn and the appreciation of the dollar dissipate.
Inflation has remained under the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) targeted objective of 2% for every month over the last three years.
The U.S. Department of Commerce said on Monday that its Core Price Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index gained 1.4% on an annual basis in December, up from 1.3% a month earlier. The Core PCE index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge on inflation.
Fischer declined to comment on the timing of the Fed's next rate hike. Shortly after the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy in December, the vice chair told CNBC that it could be appropriate to expect as many as four interest rate hikes in 2016. Last week, the FOMC left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged between 0.25 and 0.50%, citing volatility in global financial markets and reduced inflation expectations.
""The world is an uncertain place, and all monetary policymakers can really be sure of is that what will happen is often different from what we currently expect,"" Fischer said. ""That is why the Committee has indicated that its policy decisions will be data dependent.""
Esther George, Fischer's colleague on the FOMC, offered diverging viewpoints on Tuesday on the Fed's pace of tightening. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said at a speech in Missouri that she expects that the economy will improve later this year warranting further rate hikes in 2016. While George noted that the recent volatility in global financial markets was not unexpected, she added that the developments are also ""not worrisome."" George, a noted hawk, also described the Fed's December lift-off as a ""late start"" following the recovery of the U.S. economy and labor market.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell mildly to an intraday low of 98.79 before rallying to close at 98.97. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00.

In Europe, investors reacted to a major sell-off in the financial sector, as a host of major banks fell sharply amid continued sovereign wealth redemptions due primarily to the prolonged oil rout. UBS Group AG (N:UBS) shares fell approximately 7% on worse than expected profits last quarter, while Banco Santander (N:SAN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG NA O.N. (N:DB) each plunged to its lowest level since the Financial Crisis.

For January, average daily volumes (ADV) of combined FX futures and options were 920,110 contracts. On a dollar notional level, ADV was around $87 billion.
The activity was 4.3% ahead of December’s trading, but 2.7% below the same period in 2015. Overall, over 18.4 million FX contracts were traded during the month which was below December, but was higher on an ADV basis due to two fewer trading days in January.
Compared to FastMatch and Hotspot, January’s ADV growth at the CME underperformed- in these two venues, activity grew 25% and 27.5% respectively. However, during December, the CME saw a much larger increase in month over month trading compared to other venues.

Powering the month was a sharp increase in Japanese yen and Australian dollar trading. Demand in the yen has been buoyed by its roles as a safe haven currency during the current volatile period for many asset classes such as equities. For the Australian dollar, speculation appears to be returning to the currency. Speaking with traders, they have related to Finance Magnates that the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates in December has reignited analysis of rate based trades in the Aussie.

(Editor’s note: ADV volumes are calculated using a 20 day month to match calculations to those used by major FX venues around the world compared to 19 days used by the CME Group’s official figures. The discrepancy is due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday which closed trading for many asset classes. However, FX trading was open at the CME. The CME Group’s official ADV figures are 970,000 contracts that equaled $92 million on a dollar notional basis.)Original Source "

1117,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2016 05:35PM ET</span>",EUR/USD surges amid further indications of delayed rate hike from Fed,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose considerably on Monday, amid weak global manufacturing data and further indications from the Federal Reserve that it will continue to raise interest rates gradually during its first tightening cycle in nearly a decade.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0825 and 1.0913, before settling at 1.0885, up 0.0032 or 0.55% on the session. After halting a modest, two-day losing streak, on Monday the euro has now closed higher against the dollar in five of the last seven sessions. Over the last month of trading, the euro is relatively versus its American counterpart, up 0.26% for the new year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Monday morning, the Institute for Supply Management said that its manufacturing composite index inched up 0.2 from a downwardly revised 48.0 to 48.2, slightly below consensus forecasts for a 48.3 reading. It marked the fourth consecutive month of contractions, extending one of the most dismal stretches since the Great Recession. Within the report, backlog orders continued to lag, coming in at 43.0, amid weak demand for exports. While personal income jumped by 0.3% in December, extending gains from the previous month, consumers for the most part held on to the increased earnings. At the same time, consumer spending remained unchanged for the month, following a surge of 0.5% in November.
The U.S. Department of Commerce also said on Monday that its Core Price Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index gained 1.4% on an annual basis up from 1.3% a month earlier. The Core PCE index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge on inflation.
Last week, the Fed cited a weak inflation outlook as a main factor in holding its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a target range between 0.25 and 0.50%. It came amid soft GDP figures for the fourth quarter, when the U.S. economy only grew by 0.7% for the final three months of 2015. A model from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, released on Monday, forecasts seasonally adjusted GDP growth of 1.2% for the first quarter, as well as upwardly revised estimates of 1.0% for last year's final quarter.
Investors also continued to react to Friday's unexpected move from the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates into negative territory in an unprecedented action from the Japanese central bank. With the surprising decision, two of the three largest central banks in the world are now offering negative interest rates for the first time on record. The easing measures are expected to help strengthen the dollar, while implicitly tightening the monetary policy cycle for the Federal Reserve even if it continues to leaves rates unchanged. Earlier last month, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi indicated that the ECB could approve further easing measures when it meets again in March.
In somewhat of a reversal on Monday, Fed governor Stanley Fischer strongly hinted that the U.S. central bank's monetary policy will remain accommodative in the near-term future, while the Fed raises rates gradually. Speaking at a Council of Foreign Relations luncheon on Monday, Fischer noted that further declines in oil prices and a persistently strong dollar could suggest that inflation will remain lower than the Fed previously anticipated. Fischer eventually expects inflationary pressures to rise once temporary factors from the oil downturn and the appreciation of the dollar dissipate.

With Friday's sharp gains, the dollar is on pace to close the month slightly higher versus the yen by approximately 0.75%.
USD/JPY likely gained support at 116.45, the low from January 21 and was met with resistance at 123.69, the high from Nov. 18.
On Friday, the Bank of Japan lowered its rate charged to commercial banks that park excess reserves at the central bank to negative 0.1% in a somewhat shocking moved aimed at helping its economy stave off threats of deflation. By pushing rates into negative territory, the BOJ is in effect penalizing commercial banks for not lending aggressively by charging the institutions for holding excessive reserves at the central bank. After the unexpected decision, two of the top three central banks in the world are now offering rates in negative territory for the first time ever. The BOJ's unprecedented move follows a similar policy implemented by the European Central Bank in 2014.
Many economists view the move as a desperate attempt by the BOJ to bolster persistently sluggish inflation. While Japan's annual Core CPI rose modestly by 0.1% in November, it marked the first time the figure increased in five months. Japanese Core CPI, which strips out fresh food prices, remains significantly below the BOJ's price target.
The BOJ is currently pumping ¥80 trillion into the Japanese economy ($674 million) through a large-scale quantitative easing program that has achieved varying amounts of success over the last three years. In explaining his decision, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda cited increased risks related to the Chinese and Emerging Markets slowdown, as well as widespread volatility in global financial markets at the start of the year. Kuroda indicated that the BOJ will extend the negative rate policy ""as long as necessary.""
As a result of the Bank of Japan's surprising announcement, yields on both the Japan 2-Year and the Japan 5-Year plunged to their lowest level on record. Yields fell into negative territory for Japanese government bonds with a duration of three months through eight years.
In the U.S., bond prices moved to the upside as yields on 10-Year Treasuries tumbled 5.4 basis points to 1.931%, their lowest closing level in nine months.
The dovish stance from the Japanese Central Bank could persuade the Federal Reserve to delay further tightening measures, as other top global economies continue to show signs of weakness. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged between 0.25 and 0.50%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, soared more than 1% to an intraday high of 99.88. The dollar remains near a 12-month high from December, when the index eclipsed 100.00.

The currency pair traded between 1.087 and 1.0968 before settling at 1.0939, up 0.0038 or 0.33% on the session. At one point on Thursday, the euro surged to its highest level against the dollar in more than two weeks. After suffering a three-day losing streak versus the dollar at the end of last week, the euro has closed higher against its American counterpart in each of the last four sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Investors on Thursday continued to react to a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to leave short-term interest rates unchanged. Citing weakness in the global economy and sluggish inflation, the FOMC voted unanimously on Wednesday afternoon to hold its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current range between 0.25 and 0.50%. The decision came just over a month after the Fed began its first tightening cycle in nearly a decade with its first rate hike in seven years.
A wide sampling of economists are largely split on the direction the Fed will head in with its next move, after reviewing a January statement rife with ambiguity. Analysts appeared divided on whether the statement indicates that the Fed could be leaning toward a subsequent rate hike in March or if the U.S. central bank could delay further tightening measures beyond the first quarter. The decision, according to the Fed's statement, will hinge on evolving labor market conditions, inflation expectations and developments in the global financial markets. Notably, the FOMC removed a phrase that it is ""reasonably confident"" inflation will move toward its 2% objective from the statement.
""In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal,"" the FOMC said in the statement. ""The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.41% to 98.62, amid a batch of disappointing economic data.

1151,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 27, 2016 06:20PM ET</span>","EUR/USD posts modest gains, after Fed leaves interest rates unchanged","Investing.com -- EUR/USD posted modest gains on Wednesday in a volatile day of trading after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged, one month after abandoning a seven-year zero interest rate policy with a  historic rate hike.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.079 and 1.0917, before settling at 1.0893, up 0.0031 or 0.29% on the session. The euro spiked to session-highs versus the dollar following the release, before falling back slightly at the close. With the gains, the euro finished with its third consecutive winning session against its American counterpart and closed at its highest level in more than a week. As the first month of the year draws near its completion, the euro is on pace to end January up slightly against the dollar – by approximately 0.40%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Citing projections for weak economic growth and sluggish inflation expectations, the Fed as expected held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. While acknowledging that conditions in U.S. labor markets, along with household spending and business fixed income had improved in recent weeks, the FOMC blamed the recent slowdown in part on soft net export prices and the decline of inventory investment. As manufacturing production, retail spending and energy prices slumped dramatically in the fourth quarter, GDP growth for the period is expected to fall around 1%, substantially below previous estimates.
In one notable change, the FOMC removed a phrase that it is ""reasonably confident"" inflation will move toward its 2% objective from the statement. The minutes from the December FOMC meeting showed that the Fed does not expect long-term inflation to reach the target until 2018. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge on inflation, lingered around 1.3% in its latest reading last month. 
""In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal,"" the FOMC said in the statement. ""The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.""
Analysts appeared divided on whether the statement indicates that the Fed could be leaning toward a subsequent rate hike in March or if the U.S. central bank could delay further tightening measures beyond the first quarter. The decision, according to the Fed's statement, will hinge on evolving labor market conditions, inflation expectations and developments in the global financial markets. Following the release, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch tool lowered the implied probability of a March rate hike to 27.7% from 30.3% earlier on Wednesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, settled at 99.03, down 0.05% on the day. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00.
Investors await the release of January industrial and consumer data in the euro zone on Thursday for further signals of potential divergence between the Fed and the European Central Bank. Last week, ECB president Mario Draghi sent strong signals that the bank could approve a fresh round of stimulus measures when it meets again in March.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.079 and 1.0875, before settling near session-highs at 1.0868, up 0.0018 or 0.17%. After hitting a two-week closing low at 1.0797 late last week, the euro has recovered somewhat against the dollar over the last two sessions. With several trading days left in the month, the euro is still down by roughly 1% in January against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to raise short-term interest rates as much as four times in 2016, the central bank has sent strong signals that it will hold rates steady on Wednesday at the completion of its two-day January meeting. Last month, the Fed raised the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points, completing its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
Since the meeting, though, a wave of weak economic data in China and sluggish inflation forecasts might compel the Fed to slow its pace of tightening. At a press conference following the December rate decision, Fed chair Janet Yellen reiterated that the FOMC will avoid being ""mechanical"" in subsequent upward moves by taking a data-driven approach to each decision.
In its latest median projections, the FOMC anticipates that the Fed Funds Rate will reach 1.4% by the end of 2016, before approaching 2.5% by the completion of 2017. Any rate hikes this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, U.S. home prices ticked up by 0.5% in November, in line with analysts' forecasts, amid solid gains in the Mountain and Pacific regions. It followed comparable 0.5% gains a month earlier. On an annual basis, housing prices are up 5.9%, slightly below October's rate of 6.1%. The Conference Board also said on Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index for January surged to 98.1, considerably higher than consensus estimates of a 96.0 reading.
In Europe, investors await the release of employment data in France and Italy, as well as monthly inflation figures in Germany later this week for an updated outlook on the strength of the economy throughout the euro zone. It follows dovish comments from ECB head Mario Draghi last week that a new round of easing measures could be forthcoming in March to stave off risks of deflation.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.25% on Tuesday to close at 99.07. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00.
Yields on approximately one-third of government bonds in the euro zone traded in negative territory on Tuesday in response to Draghi's comments. Bond yields on the German 2-Year and 5-Year bunds both fell to record-lows.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0790 and 1.0877 before closing near session-lows at 1.0797, down 0.0078 or 0.72% on the session. It marked the third straight loss for the euro against the dollar and the fourth in the last five sessions. After opening the new year with a positive week in the first week of January, the euro fell against the dollar for the second straight week. The euro is down mildly against its American counterpart by approximately 0.5% since the start of 2016.
EUR/USD likely gained support at EUR/USD at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1352, the high from Oct. 22.
One day after hinting the ECB could expand the scope of its comprehensive Quantitative Easing program when it meets in March, ECB president Mario Draghi reiterated that the central bank has enough tools at its disposal in order to help boost inflationary pressures throughout the zone. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Draghi also indicated the ECB could be ready to act in March if the markets require intervention.
Draghi offered dovish comments on the possibility of further interest rate hikes in the near term on Thursday, after the ECB's Governing Council held its benchmark rate steady at a record-low of 0.05%. The ECB also left its deposit rate unchanged at minus 0.3%, one month after cutting it further into negative territory by 10 basis points.
""We have plenty of instruments and especially we have the determination and willingness and capacity of the Governing Council to act and deploy these instruments,"" Draghi said.
Also on the sidelines of the conference in Davos, China vice president Li Yuanchao emphasized that the People's Bank of China will continue to take an active role in regulating equity markets when such efforts are required to help reduce volatility. The Shanghai Composite index has tumbled more than 15% this year, as the Chinese economy trudges along at its slowest pace in a quarter century. Speaking exclusively to Bloomberg, Yuanchao also insisted that the PBOC has no intention of devaluing the yuan.
""The fluctuations in the currency market are a result of market forces, and the Chinese government has no intention and no policy to devalue its currency,"" Yuanchao said.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.45% to an intraday high of 99.68, before closing t 99.60. The dollar remains near a 12-month higher from December, when the index eclipsed 100.00.
The yuan comprises approximately one-fifth of the currency basket. As a result, any major devaluations in the renminbi are bullish for the dollar.
Although the ECB has mulled pushing the deposit rate further into negative territory in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve is in the midst of its first tightening cycle in a decade after abandoning a Zero Interest Rate Policy at a  historic meeting last month. Investors await the completion of next week's two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting for further indications of potential divergence between the ECB and the U.S. central bank.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose two basis points to 2.05%, while yields on the Germany 10-Yearincreased three basis points to 0.48%. Earlier this week, bond yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell to 1.93%, its lowest level since October.

1197,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 21, 2016 06:01PM ET</span>",EUR/USD pares losses after Draghi hints of further stimulus in March,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD pared sharp losses to close slightly lower on Thursday, after tumbling early in the U.S. session amid dovish signals from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi that added stimulus measures could be implemented before the end of the first quarter. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0778 and 1.0992, before settling at 1.0867, down 0.22% on the session. Despite the wild fluctuations in Thursday's session, EUR/USD has been trapped in range-bound trade in the first three weeks of the new year remaining at a level between 1.07 and 1.10. After falling by roughly 10% against its American counterpart in 2015, the euro is up slightly against the dollar in January by 0.11%. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at EUR/USD at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1352, the high from Oct. 22. 
At a closely-watched meeting in Frankfurt, the ECB's Governing Council held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.05% and its rate on its marginal lending facility at 0.30%, in line with consensus forecasts. The ECB also left its deposit rate unchanged at minus 0.3%, one month after cutting it further into negative territory by 10 basis points. Analysts also expected the deposit rate to remain steady at negative 0.3%.
Citing increased downside risks in Emerging Markets, extreme volatility in global financial and commodity markets and weak inflation expectations, Draghi said the Governing Council will reconsider its monetary policy stance when it meets next in two months. Draghi appeared particularly concerned with the effect of falling oil prices on euro zone inflation, which is currently at 0.2% -- considerably below the ECB's targeted goal of 2.0%. Since the Governing Council last met in December, Draghi noted that a variety of indicators it uses to gauge inflation expectations have declined noticeably.
The euro has struggled against the dollar since last January when the ECB announced the launching of a comprehensive Quantitative Easing program aimed at staving off deflation and bolstering growth in the area. The program involves the purchase of €60 billion a month of assets by the central bank in order to increase the amount of money supply available for banks to lend money to businesses and individuals. Large-scale easing initiatives also typically push interest rates lower, reducing domestic investments by foreign purchasers and weakening the local currency against its main rivals. Interest rates throughout the euro zone will likely remain at low levels for some time, Draghi added. 
The fluctuations in the pair on Thursday contrast starkly from the ECB's last meeting when the central bank rattled global foreign exchange markets by approving limited easing measures that fell short of market expectations on Dec. 3. In that session, the euro surged more than 3% to a one-month high at 1.0936, completing its strongest one-day move in six years. At a press conference following Thursday's rate decision, Draghi dismissed suggestions that the Governing Council was split over its decision in December to cut the deposit rates and extend the length of the asset-purchasing program through March, 2017. 
While the ECB has mulled pushing the deposit rate further into negative territory, the Federal Reserve is in the midst of its first tightening cycle in a decade after abandoning a Zero Interest Rate Policy at a historic meeting last month. Investors await the completion of next week's two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting for further indications of potential divergence between the ECB and the U.S. central bank. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, soared more than 0.60% to an intraday high of 99.89, before falling back to 99.16 at the close. The dollar remains near a 12-month higher from December, when the index eclipsed 100.00.

Housing and medical care prices inched up by 0.1% on the month, posting annual increases of 2.1% and 2.6% respectively.

The euro has closed higher against the dollar in three of the last four sessions and four of the last six trading days.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund to cut its global growth forecasts for 2016 by 20 basis points to 3.4%, marking the third time the agency has lowered its estimates over the last year. It came hours after China's National Bureau of Statistics said the  national economy grew by 6.8% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the previous quarter and the weakest since the first quarter of 2009. As a result, annual GDP in 2015 rose by 6.9%, significantly lower than growth of 7.3% a year earlier and the lowest amount in 25 years. The reading fell in line with analysts' expectations, as strong services and consumption data offset weak manufacturing and exports figures. 
For nearly three decades, from 1989 until 2015, the Chinese economy grew nearly 10% a year, including an all-time high of 15.4% in 1993. The Chinese government set a target of 7% growth in 2015, as the economy continues a transition from a manufacturing-based, test economy to a consumer-based, service one.

1248,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2016 05:56PM ET</span>","EUR/USD jumps to one-month highs, amid downbeat U.S. economic data","Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged to near one-month highs, as a wave of soft U.S. economic data potentially increased the probability that the Federal Reserve could delay its next interest rate hike beyond the first quarter of 2016.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0855 and 1.0984 before settling at 1.0916, up 0.0051 or 0.47% on the session. The euro ended the week virtually flat against the dollar, down 0.15%. After tumbling approximately 10% against the dollar in 2015, the euro is up approximately 0.5% against its American counterpart over the first two weeks of the new year. The euro last eclipsed 1.10 versus the dollar on December 16.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1352, the high from Oct. 22.
On Friday morning, the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center said in its mid-monthly flash report that U.S.consumer sentiment increased 0.7 points from the December final reading to 93.3, slightly above analysts' expectations of 93.0. Shortly after, the U.S. Census Bureau said  retail sales fell 0.1% last month, below analysts' forecasts for a flat reading. It came one month after retail sales nationwide surged by 0.4% in November.
Within the report, sales in the general merchandise category fell sharply as apparel sales slumped by 0.9%. Sales in Electronics and Appliances also demonstrated weakness, pulling down the core reading. Retail sales, minus the volatile auto and gas category, remained unchanged, finishing far below consensus estimates for a 0.3% gain.
Separately, the U.S. Producer Price Index fell 0.2% in December nearly erasing a 0.3% gain from a month earlier. The Core PPI, which strips out food and energy prices, inched up 0.1%, in line with consensus estimates. Also on Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State Manufacturing Index plummeted to negative 19.37, extending losses from December's revised reading of minus 6.21. The index fell to its lowest level since April, 2009. Industrial production, meanwhile, slipped 0.4%, while manufacturing production fell by 0.1% last month. Weakness in vehicle production, which fell by at least 1.5% for the second straight month, pulled down the overall reading.
The downbeat data could persuade the Federal Reserve to delay its next interest rate beyond the first quarter. On Friday morning, San Francisco Fed president John Williams said in a speech at the Economic Forecast Conference that further rate hikes by the U.S. central bank should be gradual. It came one day after St. Louis Fed president James Bullard cited lower inflation expectations and weakness in China as factors for why an imminent rate hike could be difficult to justify.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Investors also digested dovish signals from the European Central Bank that it could be on the verge of approving further easing measures to stave off persistently low inflation and bolster economic growth throughout the euro zone. The minutes from the ECB's December meeting, which were released on Thursday, showed that several members of its Governing Council were close to reducing its deposit rate deeper into negative territory. At a closely-watched meeting on Dec. 3, the ECB roiled global foreign exchange markets by approving only limited easing measures with its comprehensive asset-purchasing program.
Fluctuations in EUR/USD are expected to be minor until the ECB's critical interest rate decision at its Governing Council's meeting next Thursday in Frankfurt.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, lost more than 0.40% to an intraday low of 98.42, before closing at 98.99. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00.
USD/JPY fell 0.86% to 117.04, while USD/CHF lost 0.40% to 1.008 as investors sought safety in the Yen and the Swiss franc following the release of the disappointing U.S. data.

1253,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Jan 15, 2016 06:10AM ET</span>",Was the SNB Crisis the Donald Trump Moment for the Forex Industry?,"By Ron Finberg
Having entered the US Presidential race with no political background, Donald Trump’s leading position in GOP polls has been a surprise to many. More surprising has been the rise in polls following seemingly negative headlines after strange comments from Trump.
James Watson from ADS London Highlights Post-SNB Changes to the Industry 
January 15th 2015 - A Timeline of Panic
Examples include his attack on John McCain by stating “I like people who weren’t captured” and questioning whether McCain should be viewed as a war hero. Trump also has voiced several comments that can be viewed as condescending towards women, including words towards Presidential Rival Carly Fiorina and Rosie O’Donnell. The personal attacks are in addition to his general ideas such as putting up a wall with Mexico and banning Muslims from travelling to the US which upset large segments of the US population. Despite these happenings, Trump has experienced positive momentum in his campaign as it nears the Iowa Caucus later this month, the election’s first state primary Despite these happenings, Trump has experienced positive momentum in his campaign as it nears the Iowa Caucus later this month, the election’s first state primary. Among the explanations for this phenomenon being provided by statisticians is that early polls tend to favor better known candidates. As such, from the time he entered the race, Donald Trump has benefited from his celebrity status which has only gotten stronger as he dominates headlines, both positively and negatively. SNB Crisis – From Negative to Positive A similar result appears to have benefited the online retail forex industry in the wake of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) triggered Swiss franc crisis. Reaching now the one year anniversary of the SNB’s removal of its 1.2000 floor on the EUR/CHF exchange rate, and the subsequent gyrations of the franc, the overall industry appears to currently be as strong as ever.
At the time, headlines were dominated by customer losses, with many receiving notices of owing their brokers thousands of dollars due to negative account balances. On the company side, many brokers and banks alike reported multi-million dollar losses as a result of the volatility and negative customer balances that were deemed unrecoverable.
Among them, FXCM required $300 million emergency financing from outside investors to remain solvent while Saxo Bank and Interactive Brokers reported potential unrecovered losses of above $100 million. Other public firms such as IG Group and Swissquote reported losses in the tens of millions of dollars. In addition, succumbing to client losses, Alpari UK and several smaller brokers went out of business. By May 2015’s iFX Expo, many brokers, including those that suffered losses, revealed to Finance Magnates that new account openings were back to their highest levels Nonetheless, after what seemed like endless 24/7 news of the risks of forex trading and client and company losses, the negative atmosphere quickly dissipated. By May 2015’s iFX Expo, many brokers, including those that suffered losses, revealed to Finance Magnates that new account openings were back to their highest levels after dipping in February 2015.
In addition, after 2014 had been a weak year for new product releases, the conference featured the entrance of new technology providers as well as product releases from incumbents. This continued during November’s Finance Magnates London Summit which also saw lots of interest from participants to learn about new products and marketing solutions.
Even FXCM, which has become the ‘poster boy’ for the crisis and the near death experience that followed, has seen their volumes and account numbers stabilize and then grow. It’s all about awareness Speaking to industry professionals, the overall consensus is that, like Donald Trump’s advancements in the polls following negative headlines, the forex industry benefited from increased public awareness. For many existing traders, the Swiss franc’s move proved that volatility exists in forex, and meant it was worth their time to investigate its potential.

Google Trends Interest in 'Forex' (2014 to present)
Among non-investors, news from the SNB crisis led the general public to have slightly more knowledge that there is such a thing as forex trading. As a result, online advertisements marketing leverage, low spreads, 24/7 trading and access to the world’s most liquid market became slightly more understandable. This in turn had the effect of increasing banner click through rates as well as leading to more online searches about the subject. This correlation between negative headlines and positive account growth in the forex industry is far from the first time this has occurred for online businesses This correlation between negative headlines and positive account growth in the forex industry is far from the first time this has occurred for online businesses. In 2014, the Tinder App was at the center of attention, having led to a harassment legal suit, while Uber has been flagged negatively for both driver and company behavior. But, in both cases, the negativity had little to no lasting effects and helped raise product awareness.
The bottom line is that as today marks the one-year anniversary of the SNB crisis, it is important to also remember that in addition to being a financial based sector, forex trading also belongs in the online world. As a result, market forces such as viral activity and online awareness are arguably just as integral to the future of the industry as risk management practices.

1259,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 14, 2016 05:59PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls slightly amid dovish Fed comments, likely ECB rate cuts","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell slightly on Thursday extending losses from earlier this week, amid indications from the Federal Reserve that it could consider delaying its next interest rate hike and signals from the European Central Bank that further cuts in its deposit rate could be forthcoming.
The currency pair traded between 1.0835 and 1.0942, before settling at 1.0866, down 0.0019 or 0.18% on the session. While the currency pair has closed lower in four of the last five sessions, the fluctuations have been minor. After ending 2015 down approximately 10% on the year, the euro is virtually flat on the new year – up only 0.09%. EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Citing the potential for diminished inflation expectations, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard strongly hinted that the Fed should consider delaying its first interest rate hike since it abandoned a seven-year zero interest policy in December. At a speech on the economy and monetary policy in Memphis, Bullard also pointed to persistent weakness in China and the global economy for factors on why an imminent rate hike could be tough to justify. Bullard, a noted hawk, is a non-voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the current cycle. Although the FOMC is not expected to lift short-term interest rates when it meets next on Jan. 27-28, there is a higher probability that the U.S. central bank could raise rates again when it meets in March.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday that initial jobless claims ticked up by 7,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 284,000 for the week ending on January 9. Analysts expected the figure to decline slightly to 275,000 on the week. Nevertheless, new unemployment claims remained under 300,000 for the 45th consecutive week, extending the longest stretch since the early 1970s. Continuing claims also rose by 29,000 for the second straight week to reach 2.263 million, the highest level since mid-August.
In Europe, the minutes from the ECB Governing Council's December meeting showed that the central bank could be ready to lower its deposit rate again in the face of persistently low inflation. While the ECB lowered its deposit rate one-tenth to minus 0.3% at the meeting early last month, ECB president Mario Draghi was widely criticized for not instituting stronger easing measures with the bank's €1.1 trillion asset-purchasing program. In the weeks since, euro zone inflation has come under pressure from crashing oil prices and weakening demand for exports. The ECB could lower interest rates even further when it convenes at a closely-watched meeting next Thursday.
Also on Thursday, the Bank of England as expected, left its benchmark interest rate  unchanged at 0.5%. The rate has remained at its current record-low at every meeting since March, 2009. Earlier this week, the pound fell to a fresh five-year low.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.40% to an intraday high of 99.30, before closing at 99.13. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00."

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0805 and 1.0888, before closing at 1.0874, up 0.0013 or 0.12% on the session. Since closing 2015 at 1.086, EUR/USD is relatively flat in the new year, down by approximately 0.50%. The euro is coming off a disappointing year when it plummeted approximately 10% against its American counterpart, amid sharp divergences in monetary policy between the Federal Reserve and the ECB.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Investors await a highly-anticipated interest rate decision by the Bank of England on Thursday for further indications on the strength of one of the world's largest economies. Last week, the sterling corporate bond market struggled in the U.K. amid mounting concerns that a referendum on a potential ""Brexit,"" could be held as early as this summer. The British pound tumbled to a five and a half-year low earlier this week.
A departure by the U.K. from the European Union is viewed as potentially bearish for both the pound and the euro, amid heightened uncertainty on how the British and the euro zone economies could absorb the momentous split. At the very least, London's dominant hold on euro foreign exchange trading would likely decline, as flows gradually move on to Asia and other markets.
Also on Thursday, ECB president Mario Draghi could drop further hints on whether the central bank will cut its inflation target even closer to zero when the Governing Council meets later this month. Draghi is scheduled to deliver a speech on Thursday at a Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. Draghi spooked global foreign exchange markets early last month when the ECB only approved limited easing measures with its comprehensive asset-purcasing program.
Elsewhere, Federal Reserve of Boston president Eric Rosengren noted that the rout in Chinese equities in combination with persistently weak oil prices has led to mounting concerns of slowing global growth. The factors, Rosengren added, could compel the Fed to slow its pace of tightening this year. Rosengren's comments provide further ambiguity on whether the U.S. central bank could raise short-term interest rates before the end of the first quarter. Last week, Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer said in an interview with CNBC that economic conditions could be appropriate for the Fed to approve as many as four rate hikes this year.
Any upward moves this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 99.40 before settling at 98.98. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00."

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.082 and 1.0900, before closing at 1.0859, up 0.0003 or 0.02% on the session. After closing lower on each of the first two sessions of the new year, the euro has closed in the green in three of the last five trading days against the dollar.

In overnight trading, the Shanghai Composite index briefly fell under the 3,000 level before rallying late to close at 3,022.86, up 0.2% on the session. It came amid repeated efforts from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to intervene in the offshore yuan market, Bloomberg reported. As a result, the offshore yuan in Hong Kong traded at 6.5850 against the dollar, while the Renminbi in Shanghai traded at 6.5767, ensuing in a 0.2% spread between the mainland and offshore currencies.
By comparison, the spread reached a record high of 2.9% last week as the PBOC devalued the mainland yuan sharply in an effort to bolster exports. While the PBOC strictly limits yuan trading in mainland China, there is more flexibility for currency traders in Hong Kong, where it can be bought and sold more freely. While the PBOC has considered letting the mainland yuan slide to the offshore level in recent months, the move has serious political and economic ramifications. Sharp devaluations in the yuan can increase capital outflows by investors away from China, creating further damage to the economy.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.3% to an intraday high of 99.34, before closing at 99.03. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00. The yuan comprises nearly 20% of the basket, propping up the dollar when the Renminbi is devalued by the PBOC.
Elsewhere, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said at a Banque de France symposium in Paris that the Federal Reserve risks damaging a host of Emerging Market economies if it fails to raise interest rates gradually over the next year. As the Fed embarks on its first tightening cycle in a decade, Lagarde emphasized that any rate hikes should be accompanied by ""clear evidence"" of higher inflation in the U.S.
Earlier at the conference, Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer sent strong indications that the U.S. central bank would be making a mistake by reducing short-term interest rates below zero if another financial crises arises. Pushing rates into negative territory can destabilize money market funds by ""breaking the buck,"" or simply shutting them down, Fischer noted. A number of central banks in Europe currently offer deposit rates in negative territory, including prominent ones in Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark.
Last week, Fischer indicated in an interview with CNBC that the Fed could raise interest rates as much as four times in 2016. Higher interest rates are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0850 and 1.0970 before settling at 1.0858, down 0.0079 or 0.72% on the session. The euro is virtually flat against the dollar over the first few sessions of the new year after opening 2016 at 1.0860.

The PBOC set the yuan's midpoint at 6.5626 per dollar on Monday, substantially higher than last Thursday's level when it experienced its worst one-day decline in five months. Over the course of a trading day, the PBOC intervenes to prevent the exchange rate from drifting 2% above or below the midpoint. The PBOC devalued the yuan 1.6% last week, after lowering it by nearly 5% against the dollar in 2015 in an effort to stimulate its economy by boosting exports. Weak manufacturing and service sector  data for December exacerbated fears that the world's second-largest economy finished last year with the slowest GDP growth in nearly a quarter-century.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.25% to an intraday high of 98.91. The index remains near 12-month highs from December, when it eclipsed 100.00. The yuan comprises nearly 20% of the basket, propping up the dollar when its devalued by the PBOC.

The People’s Bank of China guided the yuan lower against the dollar in the first four trading sessions of 2016, roiling financial markets.
While investors had expected the central bank to allow the yuan to fall further after last year’s 4.5% depreciation, the rapid pace of the devaluation has fueled fears that the world’s number two economy is growing even more slowly than expected.
The dollar erased gains against the yen, with USD/JPY sliding to 117.43 late Friday, down from a high of 118.81 earlier in the day.
The euro ended almost unchanged against the dollar, with EUR/USD at 1.0926, off an earlier low of 1.0803.
The dollar clung to gains against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF at 0.9947 late Friday, down from the day’s highs of 1.0050.
In the week ahead, investors will continue to focus on economic reports out of China, with Wednesday’s trade data in the spotlight.
The U.S. is to release data on retail sales, producer prices and consumer sentiment later in the week, while Thursday’s monetary policy meeting minutes from the Bank of England will also be in focus.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

1305,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 08, 2016 05:39PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ends week with flat close, after mixed U.S. jobs report","Investing.com -- EUR/USD closed Friday's session flat following a choppy, volatile session, as mixed U.S. economic data added further confusion as to whether the Federal Reserve could continue to lift interest rates before the end of March. 
EUR/USD traded in a broad range between 1.0804 and 1.0931 before settling at 1.0927, closing unchanged from Thursday's settlement. After opening 2016 slightly above 1.08, the euro inched up by 0.6% against the dollar during the first week of the year. The euro is coming off a tumultuous year versus its American counterpart when it slumped approximately 10%, amid divergent monetary policies among central banks on both sides of the Atlantic. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1398, the high from Oct. 16. 
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said in its December national employment report that nonfarm payrolls surged by 292,000 last month, significantly above expectations for a consensus gain of 200,000. The Labor Department also upwardly revised gains over the prior two months by 50,000, boosting new job totals to 252,000 in November and 307,000 in October. Before last month's historic interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated that increases of around 100,000 per month this year would be enough to show that the nation's  labor situation had stabilized. 
Within the report, jobs in the Professional Business Services category soared by 73,000, providing a leading indicator for future hiring. The construction sector also added 45,000 position, amid unseasonably warm temperatures. In addition, a spike of 34,000 in temporary jobs provided the Labor Department with further optimism for a larger dip in unemployment in the near future. 
The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.0%, in line with consensus estimates. The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader gauge of the national employment situation, also stayed unchanged at 9.9%, remaining near its lowest level since May, 2008. The reading, which measures the total level of unemployed workers plus those marginally attached to the labor force, stood at 11.2% last December. The indicator also accounts for workers who are no longer looking for a job, but have looked for one over the last 12 months. 
By comparison, the alternative measure of underemployment peaked at 18% in January, 2010, as the nation continued to recover from the Financial Crisis. The U-6 rate is a preferred measure of unemployment by the Fed, as it embarks on its first tightening cycle in a decade. On Wednesday, the minutes from the Fed's December meeting showed that the U.S. central bank plans to raise rates gradually this year, as inflation remains stubbornly below its 2% objective. 
Still, there was some cause for concern throughout the report. Last month, average hourly earnings were flat, falling below consensus estimates of a 0.2% increase. The Labor Force Participation Rate also inched up modestly by 0.1% to 62.6%. While the number of job gains eclipsed analysts' expectations by a wide margin, nearly 40,000 were in the Food Services and Drinking Places category, which added almost 360,000 new positions in 2015. 
Any rate hikes this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
Yields on the Germany 10-Year fell two basis points to 0.51%, while yields on the U.S. 10-Year dropped by 3.7 basis points to 2.116%. Yields on U.S. government bonds posted their highest weekly decline since early-October. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 99.27, before paring some of the gains to close at 98.45.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0711 and 1.0940, before settling at 1.0928, up 1.40% on the session. The euro posted its strongest its one-day move against the dollar since December 3 when the European Central Bank roiled global foreign exchange markets by only approving limited easing measures with its comprehensive quantitative easing program at a closely-watched meeting in Frankfurt. Over the last month, the euro is relatively flat against the dollar, up 0.43% since December 7.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from Dec. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1352, the high from Oct. 22.
In overnight trading, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index plummeted 7% within a half-hour of the start of trading, prompting its second circuit breaker in the span of four days. Earlier, the PBOC set the midpoint of the yuan at 6.5646 against the dollar, 0.51% lower than the previous day's rate, representing the sharpest fall in the daily fixings since the currency's massive depreciation in mid-August. In Tuesday's session, the PBOC set the yuan's midpoint at 6.5314, its lowest level since February, 2011.
On Tuesday morning, the PBOC injected 130 billion yuan into the nation's open-market operations, its most since September, after weak manufacturing data last month sparked fresh concerns of a further slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Then on Wednesday, Markit said China's Caixin services PMI index  for December fell to a 17-month low at 50.2, its second-lowest level on record. Some experts view the latest intervention by the Chinese central bank as a desperate move to jumpstart its flagging economy by bolstering exports. At Thursday's low of 6.60007 versus the dollar, the yuan fell to its lowest level against the greenback in five years.
The latest crash in Chinese equities mirrors a sell-off from late-August when the PBOC devalued the yuan by its highest level in more than two decades, shocking equity markets worldwide. On August 11, the PBOC changed its mechanism for pricing the yuan's midpoint by simply basing it on the prior day's close. Previously, major state-owned banks nationwide submitted a CNY/USD exchange rate to the PBOC each morning, which calculated an average to determine the midpoint. Over the course of a trading day, the PBOC intervenes to prevent the exchange rate from drifting 2% above or below the midpoint. China's Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS) said Thursday the new midpoint pricing system has achieved its anticipated result and will be more market-oriented in the future, Reuters reported.
Fears of mounting global uncertainty and slowing economic growth worldwide could compel the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to delay its next rate hike beyond March, when the U.S. central bank could raise rates for the first time since its historic move on December 16. On Wednesday, minutes from the December FOMC meeting showed that several participants expressed concern that it may be tightening too quickly, amid stubbornly low inflation.
In addition, Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans said Thursday that the Fed should take a cautious path in raising rates by approving two rate hikes in 2016, while accounting for lower economic growth on a long-term basis. Any subsequent rate hikes are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields.
The spread between U.S. and German government bond widened on Thursday, as yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell two basis points to 2.15%.

1318,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2016 10:05AM ET</span>",China’s forex reserves drop by record amount in December,"Investing.com - China’s foreign exchange reserves recorded the largest monthly drop on record in December, falling to the lowest level in almost three years amid mounting concerns over slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
Data from the People’s Bank of China on Thursday showed that its foreign exchange reserves shrank by $107.9 billion in December, the largest monthly drop on record, after decreasing by $87 billion in November.
Overall reserves are now standing at $3.33 trillion, the data showed, after falling in 13 of the past 15 months.
The data indicated that Beijing was forced to spend more dollars to shore up the yuan last month, amid accelerating capital outflows.
The outflow of investment funds from China has been exacerbated by a slowdown in domestic economic growth, a series of rate cuts by the PBoC and the onset of a monetary tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve.
The PBoC set its official yuan midpoint rate at the lowest level since March 2011 on Thursday, spurring a renewed selloff in the currency and fueling widespread risk aversion in financial markets.
The yuan posted the largest daily decline since last August, when an unexpected near 2% devaluation of the currency sparked a broad based selloff in financial markets.
A weaker yuan would help boost Chinese exports.
While investors had expected the central bank to allow the currency to fall further amid an economic slowdown, the rapid pace of the depreciation so far this year has fueled fears that the world’s number two economy is weaker than had previously been thought.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0711 and 1.0839 before settling at 1.0783, up 0.30% on the session. With the modest gains, the euro halted a four-day skid dating back to the last trading day of 2015. The euro has still closed lower against the dollar in six of the last eight trading days.

Furthermore, the members agreed that all subsequent rate hikes would be gradual and would remain low in the long-run future for some time.
Market players are closely parsing Fed statements for clues on the path of tightening the U.S. central bank embarks on as it continues to normalize monetary policy. Earlier on Wednesday, Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer said in an exclusive interview with CNBC, that estimates of four interest rate hikes in 2016 were in the right ""ballpark."" In long-range forecasts issued last month, the FOMC estimated that the upper range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate will increase by 1.0% by the end of 2016 to 1.5%.
At the same time, there may be some dissension between FOMC on the timing of further hikes, as the December minutes indicated that several members viewed last month's lift-off as a ""close call."" Furthermore, the minutes showed that those participants would need ""greater confirmation,"" that inflation is moving toward the Fed's objective of 2% before they approved the next rate hike. Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed's targeted goal for every month over the last three years.
Any rate hikes are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The FOMC cited an uncertain inflation outlook, a subdued neutral real interest rate and a lack of flexibility for stabilizing the economy in the case of unanticipated economic shocks for factors in why it plans to raise rates gradually.
""Gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate would also allow policymakers to assess how the economy was responding to increases in interest rates. In addition, by several estimates, the neutral short-term real interest rate was currently close to zero and was expected to rise only slowly as headwinds restraining the expansion receded,"" the FOMC said in the statement. ""Moreover, the ability of monetary policy to offset the economic effects of an unanticipated economic shock remained asymmetric, and a cautious approach to normalizing policy could help minimize the risk of having to respond to a negative economic shock while the policy rate remained near its effective lower bound.""
Elsewhere, currency traders reacted to downtrodden geopolitical and economic news in Asia, as North Korea announced that it successfully detonated a miniature hydrogen bomb on Wednesday morning, while China said activity in its service sector in December fell to its lowest level in 17 months. While the apparent escalation of North Korea's nuclear capabilities spooked markets throughout Asia and sent a ripple effect through equity markets around the world, a host of experts expressed intense skepticism that Wednesday's test contained a highly-destructive hydrogen bomb. The test triggered a 5.1 magnitude earthquake, according to the United States Geological Survey, nearly matching the Richter scale readings of three other tests conducted by North Korea since 2006. The size of the tremor is generally regarded as too small for a hydrogen test. In China, the yuan fell to a fresh five-year low against the dollar as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the onshore yuan midpoint at 6.5314 per dollar, its weakest fixing since 2011. The South Korean won, meanwhile, fell to its lowest level in four months.

Big global banks forecast a 7 to 10 percent weakening of the yuan over the next 12 months, but it has begun the year with a decline of almost 2.5% in just three days. That almost matches August's one-off devaluation, which led to a global stock market selloff.
After the People's Bank of China again fixed its onshore rates for the yuan lower, the offshore rates for the currency fell more than 1% against the dollar to a record low of 6.7315.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0711 and 1.0839 before settling at 1.0753, down 0.66% on the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in four straight sessions and six of the last seven. The euro is down approximately 1.75% since December 3 when the European Central Bank rattled global foreign exchange markets by only approving limited easing measures to it comprehensive asset purchasing program at a closely-watched meeting.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0565, the low from November 25 and was met with resistance at 1.1059, the high from Dec. 15.
Last month, inflation in the euro area increased by 0.2% on an annual basis, in line with analysts' forecasts of a 0.2% gain. In November, annual inflation also increased moderately by 0.2%. In terms of core inflation, the annual gains provided less optimistic results. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, rose by 0.8%, slightly lower from November increases of 0.9%. The reading also came in lower than analysts' forecasts for a 1.0% annual gain.
The soft reading could prompt the ECB to cut interest rates when it convenes at a highly-anticipated meeting on Jan. 21. The euro has slumped approximately 10% against the dollar since the ECB launched a comprehensive €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program in early-2015. The asset purchasing program has weakened the euro by increasing the ECB's supply base, propping up other major currencies such as the dollar, pound and Japanese yen. Companies which sell bonds to the central bank, can also use the money to invest overseas, driving down the price of the euro versus the dollar.
The dollar also received further support from concerns in China, as currency traders continued to react to Monday's sell-off when the Shanghai Composite index crashed 7% and the yuan suffered one of its worst one-day sessions in several months. On Tuesday morning, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected the most cash into the nation's open-market operations since September, one day after weak manufacturing data for December sent Chinese equities crashing, sparking fresh concerns of a further slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
In its latest effort to bolster its flagging economy, the PBOC offered 130 billion yuan ($19.9 billion) of seven-day reverse repo's on Tuesday at an interest rate of 2.25%. The stimulus measures are aimed at lowering borrowing costs in order to jumpstart activity in an economy that is projected to report its slowest annual growth rate in more than two decades.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.65% to an intraday high of 99.53, before settling at 99.47. The index has closed higher in six consecutive sessions."

1344,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2016 09:43AM ET</span>",WTI oil futures slump to 2-week low ahead of API supply data,"Investing.com - West Texas Intermediate oil prices extended losses from the prior session on Tuesday to hit a two-week low as market players looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later Tuesday, while Wednesday’s government report could show crude stockpiles fell by 0.5 million barrels in the week ended January 1.
Crude oil for delivery in February on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 35 cents, or 0.95%, to trade at $36.41 a barrel as of 14:40 GMT, or 9:40AM ET. It earlier fell to $36.19, the lowest since December 22. 
On Monday, Nymex prices lost 28 cents, or 0.76%, in choppy volatile trade. Prices fell to a six-year trough of $34.29 on December 21.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for February delivery dropped 45 cents, or 1.22%, to trade at $36.77 a barrel during U.S. morning hours.
A day earlier, London-traded Brent futures rose to $38.99, the most since December 15, before turning lower to end at $37.22, down 6 cents, or 0.16%, as ongoing concerns over a global supply glut outweighed geopolitical tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Oil prices spiked more than 4% at one point on Monday, as investors reacted to a move by Saudi Arabia to cut commercial ties with Iran, fueling concerns over geopolitical instability in the Middle East. However, investors quickly discounted those fears, as no immediate threat was seen to global supplies.
Brent prices slumped to an 11-year low of $35.98 on December 22, as worries over the health of the global economy added to the concerns that a global supply glut may stick around for longer than anticipated.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the West Texas Intermediate crude contract stood at 36 cents, compared to a gap of 46 cents by close of trade on Monday.
Global crude production is outpacing demand following a boom in U.S. shale oil and after a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year not to cut production in order to defend market share.
Oversupply issue will be exacerbated further once Iran returns to the global oil market early next year after western-imposed sanctions are lifted. Analysts say the country could quickly ramp up production by around 500,000 barrels, adding to the glut of oil that has sent prices tumbling.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0782 and 1.0946 before settling at 1.0832 down 0.0022 or 0.21% on the session. At one point, the euro fell to its lowest level versus the dollar since December 3 when the European Central Bank rattled global foreign exchange markets by only approving limited easing measures to it comprehensive asset purchasing program at a closely-watched meeting. The euro has now closed lower against the dollar in each of the last four sessions and six of the last seven. Last week, EUR/USD ended the year down more than 10% capping a tumultuous year for the euro amid divergent monetary policies between the Federal Reserve and the ECB. Over the next 12 months, the Fed could approve as many as four rate hikes as the U.S. central bank gradually embarks on its first tightening cycle in a decade.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0561, the low from December 1 and was met with resistance at 1.1041, the high from Dec. 9.
The dollar built on gains from last week after China reported weaker than expected manufacturing data in December, sparking fresh concerns of slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. Last month, the China Caixin PMI index fell by 0.4 points to 48.2, considerably below analysts' forecasts for a 49.0 reading. Any reading below 50 provides indications of contraction in the manufacturing sector. The disappointing data weighed on Chinese stocks, as the Shanghai Composite Index halted trading at one point on Monday after falling by as much as 7%.
The Chinese sell-off spilled over into global stock markets on a bearish start to 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by as much as 450 points, suffering one of its worst openings to a year in more than 80 years, while the Germany Dax experienced its worst session in five years. As investors exited from their position in global equities, many flocked to less risky U.S. government bonds, as treasury yields fell for the third consecutive session. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell by nearly seven basis points to 2.207%, its lowest level since Dec. 18, before closing at 2.243%.
Investors await the release of euro area inflation data and Germany factory orders on Tuesday for further indications on whether the ECB could enact further stimulus measures later this month. Analysts expect an annual rise of 0.4% in inflation last month, following a 0.2% rise in November.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.35% to an intraday high of 99.30, its highest level in two and a half weeks, before closing at 98.94. The index has closed higher in six straight sessions."

1375,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Dec 30, 2015 09:00AM ET</span>","Oddly Enough, Bitcoin Price Jumps to 1-Month High Following Satoshi Reports","By Leon Pick
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) jumped by 6.1% following reports of the possible uncovering of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity, and have since extended their gains.
Bitcoin hit a one-month high of $425 on Bitstamp. It had not traded this high since coming off its spike to over $500.
The rise would seem highly counterintuitive. If Satoshi's true identity was indeed uncovered, one might have expected fear to grip the markets. The reports may have shed more light on Satoshi's reported stockpile of 1 million bitcoins, which if liquidated, could trigger an unprecedented price crash.
In addition, many Bitcoiners have historically been more at peace with Satoshi's identity remaining unknown, in line with the theme of Bitcoin's anonymity.
Traders apparently did not fear a sell-off, and some were perhaps hopeful of a brighter Bitcoin future with the news.
The jump came on a spike in volume which immediately returned to normal levels. Recent reported bitcoin trading volumes have been the highest on record, though most figures reported by exchanges cannot be independently verified.
Bitcoin is now up by over 30% for the year and is trading 22% above its 50-day moving average (MA).
Once again, litecoin's (LTC/USD) jump was smaller. The LTC/BTC rate thus fell to 0.0085, coming dangerously close to its lowest levels since June.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2015 07:09AM ET</span>",China suspends forex business for some foreign banks: sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank has suspended at least three foreign banks from conducting some foreign exchange business until the end of March, three sources who had seen the suspension notices told Reuters on Wednesday.
Included among the suspended services are liquidation of spot positions for clients and some other activities related to cross-border, onshore and offshore businesses, the sources said.
The sources, speaking on condition that the banks were not named, said the notices sent to the affected foreign banks by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) gave no reason for the suspension. 
The PBOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The measure follows a slew of steps taken by the Chinese government to keep the yuan stable since it devalued the currency in August. 
The spread between the onshore and offshore markets for the yuan, or renminbi, has been growing since the devaluation, making it increasingly difficult for the central bank to manage its currency and stem an outflow of capital from an economy that is facing its slowest growth in 25 years.
The sources told Reuters that authorities had warned the banks that if they engaged in lucrative carry trade, taking advantage of the different exchange rates, the central bank would move to further block arbitrage channels.
""This is part of the PBOC's expedient means to stabilize the yuan's exchange rate,"" said an executive at a foreign bank contacted separately.
The sources said the banks might have been targeted due to the large scale of their cross-border forex businesses.
An economist at a top government think-tank said the measure was a temporary bid to curb demand for dollars that has been strengthening toward the end of the year as the gap between the onshore and offshore yuan exchange rates widens.
""They hope to ease foreign exchange buying pressure and ease depreciation pressure on the yuan,"" said the economist who declined to be identified by name. ""But I don't think the authorities will take very strong capital control measures, they are likely to reinforce the existing measures.""
The move could also ease pressure on the PBOC for direct intervention in offshore markets to support the yuan, which has contributed to a fall of more than $400 billion in China's foreign exchange reserves this year.
UNDER SCRUTINY
In common with forex markets worldwide, there are no official data on which banks are the most active in trading foreign exchange in China.
A 2015 Asiamoney survey asking market participants which brokers they used named  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) as the top foreign forex provider in China, followed by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, HSBC,  Citigroup  (N:C) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
Asked if they had received the central bank's suspension notice, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and BNP Paribas declined to comment. There was no immediate response from ANZ.
 Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and DBS, which also conduct trading in foreign exchange in China, did not respond to requests for comment.
The latest move comes just three months since the PBOC ordered banks to closely scrutinize clients' foreign exchange transactions to prevent illicit cross-border currency arbitrage between the offshore and onshore yuan.
On Wednesday, the country's foreign exchange regulator also said it would improve its reserve position and contingency plans to curb risks from abnormal cross-border capital flows.
The yuan has come under renewed pressure since late November amid speculation that Beijing would permit more depreciation after the International Monetary Fund announced the currency's admission into the fund's basket of reserve currencies.
The onshore yuan traded in Shanghai has lost 1.44 percent of its value since the end of November, and has repeatedly hit 4-1/2 year lows.

The offshore market has traced a similar pattern. The Hong Kong-traded offshore yuan hit an intraday low of 6.5965 on Wednesday morning, its weakest since late September 2011.

1380,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Dec 30, 2015 03:50AM ET</span>",Bitcoin Price Tumbles 8% after Failing to Break Resistance,"By Leon Pick
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) fell 8% to a 1-week low of $425 during the past 24 hours.
The steep drop is one of several big moves that have become increasingly common since bitcoin’s resurgence in late November.
Over the past week, bitcoin ran into fierce resistance near $467. If bitcoin would advance past this mark, the prospects of revisiting $500 would be more convincing. Bitcoin’s hype-filled spike to $500 in early November is believed by some to have been driven by investors flocking to a Ponzi scheme.
Despite falling below $300 within days after the spike, bitcoin stabilized and subsequently climbed to its recent highs, lending credibility to the theory that more genuine factors were also at play during bitcoin’s initial rally.
After hitting a low of $425 earlier today, bitcoin recovered to as high as $442 before stabilizing near $435.
It is trading 15% above its 50-day moving average (MA), which has been rising since early October. Year-to-date, bitcoin has gained 36%.
The price premium on Chinese exchanges is hovering near 3%, suggesting again that China is responsible for dragging the markets higher. During the early-November craze, the premiums exceeded 6%.
Litecoin also fell, but per the recent trend, its moves have been more muted relative to those of bitcoin. It declined by as much as 7% to $3.39. The LTC/BTC rate came off 6-month lows near 0.0078.

1394,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Dec 28, 2015 09:11AM ET</span>",Bitcoin Price Climbs to 3-Week High,"By Leon Pick
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) today resumed last week's resurgence, climbing another 7.6% to $383 on Bitstamp and hitting a 3-week high.
Unlike the turbulent rally to above $500 one month ago, during which record volumes were reported, the latest mini-streak has seemingly been calmer. The average volume during the past week is a whole order of magnitude lower than that of one month ago, and more in line with the daily averages in 2015.
Another defining feature of the previous rally was the likely role of China. Prices on Chinese exchanges were frequently more than 5% higher than elsewhere, suggesting that they may have been dragging the markets higher. The China premium has virtually disappeared since then, though today it has climbed back above 1.5%.
Bitcoin is now 19% ahead of its 50-day moving average, and higher by the same amount year-to-date. Bitcoin had, until one month ago, traded in negative territory for all of this year. The turnaround was not expected by many, especially following this year's August sell-off.
The strength of Bitcoin's blockchain, as observed with the continuing increase in transaction traffic, may be contributing to renewed investor optimism.
""In our opinion the recent increase in price is the result of influx of investment and interest by banks and corporations, which are driving the expansion of the blockchain and related technologies,"" said Kerri Dunn, Vice President at Kingsbridge Wealth Management, to Finance Magnates.
The firm, which oversees over $300 million in assets, also runs an alternative assets hedge fund. An early bitcoin investor, Dunn believes that there will be more price volatility ""as the Bitcoin ecosystem and blockchain find their permanent place."" A short-term rise to $500 is not impossible, she said. Long-term, the price is likely to be dependent on how quickly the blockchain ecosystem develops.

1400,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 24, 2015 02:29PM ET</span>",EUR/USD posts steady gains in abbreviated Christmas Eve session,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose considerably during an abbreviated session, as currency traders looked to capitalize on last-minute gains ahead of the Christmas holiday.
The currency pair traded between 1.0904 and 1.0966 before settling near session-highs at 1.0963, up 0.0052 or 0.47% on the session. EUR/USD has been relatively flat since last week's historic decision by the Federal Reserve to abandon a seven-year zero interest rate policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade. The pair is also virtually unchanged since the European Central Bank rattled global foreign exchange markets on December 3 with an unexpected decision to approve only limited easing measures with its comprehensive asset-purchasing program. Following the shocking announcement by ECB president Mario Draghi, the euro surged more than 3% against the dollar on the session, one of its strongest one-day moves of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from Dec. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 267,000 for the week ending on Dec. 18. The number of initial claims dipped to near 45-year lows, falling to levels last seen in late-1973. Analysts expected new claims to decelerate slightly by 1,000 to 270,000 on the week. Last Wednesday, Fed chair Janet Yellen cited a tightening labor market that is nearing full employment as the primary factor in the Fed's decision to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.
Investors continued to digest solid inflation data from Wednesday's session for further indications on when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) could approve its next rate hike. On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index increased by 0.4% on a yearly basis last month, above 0.2% annual gains in October.
The Core PCE index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inched up by 0.1% last month, in line with consensus estimates. Over the last year, core prices are up 1.3%, unchanged from October's reading. Core PCE prices, the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, have fallen below its targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. Yellen expects long-term inflation to move toward the Fed's targeted objective, as temporary factors from a stronger dollar and dwindling oil prices fade.
At last week's historic meeting, the FOMC projected that the upper-bound range for the Fed Funds Rate will increase a full percentage point to 1.5% by the end of 2016. The estimates imply that the FOMC could approve four modest rate hike throughout the course of next year. On Thursday, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch calculated the probability of a March rate hike at 50.3%, down from 53.6% a session earlier.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell by one basis point to 2.24%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year gained a basis point to 0.63%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.40% to an intraday low of 97.96, before settling at 98.02. Earlier this month, the index eclipsed 100.00 to reach its highest level in more than 12 months. With only a handful of sessions left in 2015, the euro is down by more than 9% versus the dollar since the start of the year.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0871 and 1.0958, before settling at 1.0910, down 0.0047 or 0.43% on the session. EUR/USD has been virtually flat since the Federal Reserve ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy last Wednesday when it approved its first rate hike in nearly a decade. During a volatile month of trading, the euro has gained more than 3.25% in value against is American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1352, the high from Oct. 22. 
The dollar held onto gains from the morning session amid a weak batch of data in the euro zone. In France, third quarter GDP was revised down by 0.1% to 1.1% annually, providing a harbinger of potential slowing economic growth in the final quarter of the year. The subdued reading was accompanied by downbeat data in the U.K. where GDP increased by 2.1% annually in the third quarter, decelerating from yearly growth of 2.3% in the previous quarter. It marked the worst third quarter in the U.K. since 2013. 
In the U.S, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said U.S. personal income ticked up by 0.3% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month that the figure moved higher. Analysts forecasted gains of 0.2% last month, following a robust increase of 0.4% in October. It came amid an acceleration in wages and salaries for government workers and an $11.6 billion bonus paid to United Auto Workers employees, one of the nation's largest unions.
As the labor market continues to tighten, nearing full employment, wages and salaries have also increased exponentially. In November, wages rose by 0.5% following gains of 0.6% a month earlier. The strong gains in personal income should support consumer spending and bolster economic growth over the next year. Consumer spending, which represents roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased by 0.3% in November, after remaining flat a month earlier.
In terms of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index remained flat in November, below consensus expectations for a 0.1% gain. On a yearly basis, though, the PCE price index increased by 0.4%, above 0.2% annual gains. The Core PCE index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inched up by 0.1% last month, in line with consensus estimates. Over the last year, core prices are up 1.3%, unchanged from October's reading. Core PCE prices, the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, have fallen below its targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years.
The relatively strong inflation data, however, could compel hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to push for another rate hike during the first quarter of next year. In its December monetary policy outlook, the FOMC forecasted that its benchmark Federal Funds Rate could rise by 1.0% over the next 12 months to 1.5% by the end of 2016. On Wednesday, the CME Group's (O:CME) FedWatch placed the probability of a quarter-point hike in March at 53.6%.

A separate report showed that personal spending inched up 0.3% last month, meeting forecasts. Personal income, meanwhile, rose 0.3%, above forecasts for a 0.2% gain.
The core PCE price index rose 0.1% last month. On an annualized rate, the core PCE price index increased 1.3%. The Fed uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates, with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2% or below.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2015 02:00AM ET</span>",Record highs predicted for bitcoin in 2016 as new supply halves ,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - 2016 could prove to be the year that the price of bitcoin surges again. Not because of any dark-web drug-dealing or Russian ponzi scheme, but for an altogether less sensational reason - slower growth in the money supply.
Bitcoin is a web-based ""cryptocurrency"" used to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. But despite being championed by some as the digital money of the future, it is often dismissed as a currency that is too volatile to invest in. 
The reason 2016 looks set to be different is that bitcoin's price is likely to be driven in large part by similar factors to a traditional fiat currency, following the age-old principles of supply and demand. 
Instead of being controlled by a central bank, bitcoin relies on so-called ""mining"" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and thereby clear the transactions is currently rewarded with 25 new bitcoins, worth around $11,000 . 
But when it was invented in 2008 by the mysterious ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", who has yet to be identified, the bitcoin program was designed so that the reward would be halved roughly every four years, in order to keep a lid on inflation. The next time that is due to happen is July 2016.
Bitcoin was also designed to emulate a commodity by having a finite supply of 21 million bitcoins, which will be reached in around 125 years, up from around 15 million today. Hence, also, the use of the term ""mining"".
Daniel Masters, co-founder of Jersey-based Global Advisors' multi-million dollar bitcoin hedge fund, started his career as an oil trader at Shell (L:RDSa) in the mid-1980s and spent 30 years trading commodities before crossing over to bitcoin.
Now he reckons the price of bitcoin could test its 2013 highs of above $1,100 next year and then pick up speed to rise to $4,400 by the end of 2017.
That would be due to a number of factors, Masters said, including an increased acceptance of payments in bitcoin by big companies and authorities, rapidly growing interest and investment in the ""blockchain"" technology that underpins bitcoin transactions, and also more demand from China as its currency weakens and the economy slows. 
But taken in isolation, the halving of the mining reward will increase the price of bitcoin by around 50 percent from where it is now, Masters reckons. That is despite the fact that the halving of the reward has always been inevitable - a factor that would already have been accounted for in pretty much every other market.
""If OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries)came out tomorrow and said, 'in six months' time we're going to halve oil production', the oil price would instantaneously react. But the bitcoin market is still in its infancy, and I don't think that factor is discounted into the price fully,"" he said.
DECENTRALIZED DIGITAL ASSET
Bitcoin's price has already almost doubled in the last three months, putting it on track for its best quarter in two years. It hit $500 last month for the first time since August last year, with Chinese demand for a pyramid scheme set up by a Russian fraudster cited as a reason for the price surge. 
But Bobby Lee, the chief executive of one of the leading bitcoin exchanges in China, BTCC, reckons there is scope for the cryptocurrency to go much further. He thinks the price could increase by as much as eight times in the time up to the reward halving, taking it as high as $3,500 by next summer. 
""Today the worth of bitcoin is $1 per capita in the world (population),"" Lee said, referring to the value of all the bitcoins in circulation, around $6.5 billion. ""For such an innovative, decentralized digital asset, I say 'boy, are we undervaluing it'. But it takes a while for people to realize that.""
The mining reward has already been halved once before, in November 2012, from 50 to 25 bitcoins. The stakes were much lower then, with one bitcoin worth around $12, but nevertheless the price increased by about 150 percent in the preceding seven months - roughly the time left before the next halving. 
""It (the halving) dampens supply so, all other things being equal, that puts upwards pressure on price,"" said Jeremy Millar, partner at London-based financial technology specialists Magister Advisors, who expects demand to continue to increase.

""No one can argue with that fundamental economic principle.""

1408,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 22, 2015 05:34PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ticks up, as dollar weakens amid soft U.S. GDP data","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose moderately on Tuesday on a thin day of trading, as soft U.S. GDP data weighed heavily on a steadily weakening dollar.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0902 and 1.0984 before settling at 1.0954, up 0.0039 or 0.36% on the session. The euro is enjoying a modest three-day winning streak versus the dollar and is up by 0.26% against its American counterpart since the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade last week. More broadly, the euro is up by more than 3.20% against the dollar since the European Central Bank rattled global currency markets by only instituting limited easing measures with comprehensive asset-purchasing program at a closely-watched meeting at the start of the month. The dollar is currently down by nearly 2% against a basket of rivals in December, suffering its worst month since April.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
The moves by the Fed and the ECB over the last several weeks could portend further divergence between the two major central banks, as the Fed completes the early stages of its first tightening cycle since 2004. Earlier this week, analysts from  Charles Schwab  (N:SCHW) said 20 central banks, representing roughly one-third of global GDP, hiked interest rates in 2015, marking a sharp divergence from recent monetary policy over the past several years. More importantly, the analysts noted that ""volatility may result as the widening divergence contributes to the challenges facing some markets."" Markets throughout the euro zone may be equipped to handle the shifts in monetary policy, according to Schwab, amid signs of improving economic and financial growth. 
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said real gross domestic product in the third quarter increased at a rate of 2.0%, down sharply from annual GDP growth of 3.9% in the second quarter of 2015. The BEA's third estimate released on Tuesday also fell slightly from its second estimate of 2.1% growth issued last month. Real GDP measures the value of the goods and services produced by a nation's economy minus the goods and services used up in production, adjusted for price changes.
The BEA noted in its statement that the mild increase in real GDP is reflected in positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government spending, residential fixed investment, and exports that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment.
At the same time, the deceleration in GDP growth on a quarterly basis denoted a downturn in private inventory investment and exports. Inventory growth was downwardly revised by nearly $5 billion to $85.5 billion, as businesses held inventories down amid slumping sales. Nevertheless, quarterly real GDP fell in line with consensus estimates of growth of 2.0%. The GDP Price Index, meanwhile, increased 1.3% on the quarter, remaining unchanged from the previous quarter.
Investors await Wednesday's monthly release of the PCE index for November for further indications on the gradual path the Fed may take in its first tightening cycle since 2004. Core PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has remained below the Fed's targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. In October, core PCE prices were up by 1.3% on a yearly basis, remaining flat from the prior month's reading.
In updated inflation forecasts released last week, the Fed projected that inflation will not reach its targeted objective until 2018. Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 and 0.50%. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.35% to an intraday low of 98.01, before closing at 98.18. Earlier this month, the index eclipsed 100.00, reaching its highest level on the calendar year."

The currency pair traded between 1.0849 and 1.0939 before settling at 1.0915, up 0.0048 or 0.44% on the session. EUR/USD is relatively flat since the Fed voted unanimously to abandon its zero-interest rate policy at a closely-watched meeting last week.

Investors continue to digest last week's historic decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since June, 2006. Citing improved labor market conditions and expectations that long-term inflation will move back toward its 2% objective, the FOMC increased the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. The Federal Funds Rate previously remained at record-lows in a zero-bound range for seven consecutive years since the height of the Financial Crisis.
Following the announcement, Fed chair Janet Yellen faced a barrage of questions on how the FOMC could respond to changes in inflationary pressures as it normalizes monetary policy. Echoing sentiments from September, the FOMC does not project that long-term inflation will reach 2% until the end of 2018. While Yellen noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation remain near historically-low levels, she emphasized that the declines over the past 18 months may reflect changes in ""risk and liquidity premiums, rather than an outright decline in inflation expectations.""
Inflation has remained under the Fed's targeted goal for every month over the last three years.
When the U.S. Department of Commerce releases its monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures Index on Wednesday, analysts expect few changes in November, amid modest increases in personal income and consumer spending. Sharp declines in oil prices are expected to weigh heavily on the PCE Price Index, while Core PCE prices are expected to inch up by 0.1% on the month.
The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge for long-term inflation, strips out volatile food and energy prices. On Monday, North Sea brent crude futures nearly hit $36 a barrel, plunging to its lowest level in 11 years. On a yearly basis, core PCE prices were up by 1.3% in October, remaining flat from the previous month's reading.

1427,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 18, 2015 06:26PM ET</span>","USD/JPY retreats from two-week highs, amid unexpected easing from BOJ","Investing.com -- USD/JPY fell sharply off two-week highs after the Bank of Japan detailed plans for a new round of Exchange Trade Fund purchases to complement its existing easing program, defying market expectations for a quiet monetary policy meeting on Friday.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 121.06 and 123.52 before settling at ¥121.16, down 1.40 or 1.14%. With the considerable losses, the yen halted a four-day losing streak against the dollar. In June, the dollar hit a 12 and a half year high versus the yen, amid strong indications of an impending divergence in monetary policies between the Federal Reserve and the BOJ. On Wednesday, the Fed abandoned its seven-year policy of holding interest rates at record near-zero levels, by approving its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade.
In a unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lifted the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to a level between 0.25% and 0.50%.
As the Fed wound down its comprehensive asset-purchasing program last fall, Japan continued to aggressively ramp up a host of Quantitative Easing measures in order to stimulate its flagging economic growth. Last October, the BOJ provided a jolt to the Japanese economy by expanding its annual purchases of government bonds by 30 trillion yen to 80 trillion yen. Two days earlier, the Fed officially ended a five-year, $4.5 trillion bond-buying program intended to lift the economy out of The Great Recession.
The surprising decision from the BOJ on Friday came less than two weeks after upward revisions on the national economic outlook showed the Japanese economy expanded slightly in the third quarter. The revised projection to growth of 1.0% in third quarter GDP from initial estimates of a 0.8% decline expunged gloomy sentiments of a potential recession in the world's third largest economy.
The Bank of Japan said Friday that it will continue to monitor inflation developments as persistently sluggish prices remain well below its long-term targeted goal of 2%.
Japan's alternative measure of Core Inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rebounded to 1.2% in October after two previous monthly declines. In September, core inflation in Japan fell on an annual basis for the first time since April, 2013.
""It is appropriate to encourage a smoother decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve taking into account developments in the JGB market and the situation in financial institutions' asset holdings,"" the BOJ said in a statement. ""Moreover, as conversion of firms' and households' deflationary mindset has been progressing under Quantitative Easing and many firms have become proactive in making investment in physical and human capital, it is desirable that these developments will become further widespread. From this perspective, the Bank decided to adopt supplementary measures for Quantitative Easing.""
Elsewhere, Fed data released on Friday showed that its Average or Effective Federal Funds Rate traded between 0.25 and 0.59% in Thursday's session, up from 0.08 to 0.55% a day earlier. It marked the highest top end level of the Fed's benchmark rate since November, 2011.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.50% on to an intraday low of 98.67 before settling at 98.73. The index eclipsed 100.00 at the start of December to reach a 12-month high.

USD/JPY changed hands at 122.60, up 0.04%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7133, up 0.10%.
The Bank of Japan voted 8 to 1 as expected to keep its monetary base easing at ¥80 trillion annually, but extended the maturity to 7 to 12 years for purchases of Japan government bonds and setup a new program for exchange traded fund buying in a narrower 6 to 3 vote.
The views on the economy remained stable as continuing to recover, while inflation was seen flat year-on-year.
Earlier, China reported house prices year-on-year for November rose 0.9%, along woith an ANZ business confidence survey for December in New Zealand showed a gain to plus-23, an eight-month high, from plus-14.6 in November. NZD/USD traded at 0.6697, down 0.02%.
""Our composite indicator, combining business and consumer sentiment, flags a potential rebound in growth to over 3%. We're more circumspect - picking growth in the 2.5%-3% zone. But there's little denying an improvement in the growth stakes,"" ANZ chief economist Cameron Bagrie said.
""Still, there's much to ponder for the New Year. New Zealand remains the two-bit player at the international roulette table. Volatility across equities, commodities, the New Zealand dollar and international economies is here to stay. Where China and the export price toboggan settle remains uncertain. The long game is simple. New Zealand sits in the right part of the world, sells the right stuff, has an abundance of natural resources, a strong brand, is well liked globally and has huge free-trade access. The biggest issue is how we execute on those opportunities as opposed to the macro risks around them.""
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, eased 0.18% to 99.03.
Overnight, the dollar remained broadly higher against the other major currencies on Thursday, after the release of upbeat U.S. jobless claims data as the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade continued to support.
The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending December 11 decreased by 11,000 to 271,000 from the previous week’s total of 282,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 7,000 to 275,000 last week.
Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index deteriorated to -5.9 this month from November's reading of 1.9. Analysts had expected the index to dip to 1.5 in December.
The reports came a day after the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to between 0.25% and 0.50% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. It was the first rate hike in the U.S. since 2006.
Commenting on the decision, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that further rate hikes would be gradual and data dependent.

1435,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2015 08:02PM ET</span>",USD/MXN inches down after Bank of Mexico completes first hike since 2008,"Investing.com -- USD/MXN fell mildly on Thursday as the Bank of Mexico lifted interest rates for the first time since 2008, in a move that was considered inevitable after the Federal Reserve abandoned its seven-year zero interest rate policy one day earlier. 
The currency pair traded between 16.9172 and 17.1612 before settling at 17.0427, down 0.0047 or 0.03% on the session. In early-December, the Mexico peso fell to record-lows versus the dollar as the likelihood of a Fed rate hike became more apparent. The peso is down by approximately 15% against its American counterpart this year, as investors flocked to safer assets north of the border. 
On Thursday, the Bank of Mexico increased its overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.25%, moving it off record-lows for the first time since the Financial Crisis. For a 10-year period beginning in 2005, the rate averaged 5.5%, hitting an all-time high of 9.25% in October of that year. 
Many analysts regarded the move as a necessity, as the nation faces severe headwinds from slow economic growth and declining inflation. In November, inflation in Mexico fell to a record-low of 2.21%, amid low gas prices and mobile phone rates. The Bank of Mexico slashed interest rates four times since the Financial Crisis to offset reduced inflationary pressures, the last coming 18 months ago. 
Following the Fed's historic move on Wednesday, Mexico risked even sharper depreciations in the peso had it left rates unchanged. In a unanimous decision, the Federal Reserve, lifted its benchmark Fed Funds Rate on Wednesday by 25 basis points to a range between 0.25 and 0.50%. Nearly a decade had passed since the Fed last raised short-term rates. 
""This should contribute to maintain confidence in Mexico, distinguishing it from other emerging countries, so that the sovereign risk component in interest rates, like other risk premiums remain low,"" the Mexico Central Bank said in a statement. ""The latter is crucial to the current external environment in which financial conditions they are becoming more stringent.""
Emerging Market activity throughout the world has slumped due primarily to an economic slowdown in China and declining basic materials prices, the Bank of Mexico added. 
While the Fed could raise short-term rates by as much as 1% next year, the Bank of Mexico has not indicated if Thursday's hike could signal the beginning of a tightening cycle. "
1436,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2015 06:20PM ET</span>","Dollar gains traction, BOJ next up to the plate","By Ian Chua
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar stood at its highest in two weeks against a basket of currencies early on Friday, having made a decisive move a day after the Federal Reserve delivered a long-awaited hike in interest rates.
Commodity currencies were hardest hit as the firmer greenback took a toll on a range of commodities from oil to base metals and gold. The Canadian dollar was now close to a 12-year low, having come within a whisker of C$1.40 per USD . 
Argentina's peso plunged more than 26.5 percent on Thursday as a new government floated the currency as part of a slew of free-market reforms.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) was flirting with 99.000, holding onto a 1.2 percent gain on Thursday - its biggest rise in over a month. The greenback rose broadly on Wednesday after the Fed ended months of speculation by lifting its benchmark rate off zero.
""The USD can make new cyclical highs in the near term as US interest rate expectations adjust higher,"" said Elias Haddad, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.
The Fed's own projections were for 100 basis points of hikes in 2016. By contrast, the futures market was only discounting just over 50 basis points of tightening.
""We believe the FOMC's normalisation process will be gradual and expect 75 bps of rate hikes in 2016 bringing the upper‑bound of the Fed Funds target range to 1.25 percent. This will support the USD.""
Against the yen, the dollar reached its highest in over a week at 122.88 <JPY=> before stepping back to 122.51. The euro was back at $1.0834 <EUR=>, off this week's peak of $1.1060.
Along with their Canadian peer, the Antipodean currencies fared badly. The Australian dollar briefly dipped below 71 U.S. cents  for the first time in a month, before edging back to $0.7123. Its New Zealand counterpart fell to its lowest in over a week at $0.6688 <NZD=D4>.
With the Fed out of the way, the focus on Friday will be on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), though the central bank is expected to hold off on any additional stimulus in its final policy review of the year.

But BOJ policymakers are still likely to debate lingering risks to the economic outlook that could warrant additional easing in coming months.

1438,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2015 05:52PM ET</span>",EUR/USD falls sharply in the aftermath of Fed's historic rate hike,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply, as expected, as the dollar soared to two-week highs on the first full day of trading after the Federal Reserve abandoned a seven-year policy of holding interest rates at near zero levels as part of a long-term plan to stimulate an economy battered in the Financial Crisis. 
In a unanimous decision, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), lifted the Federal Funds Rate on Wednesday by 25 basis points to a range between 0.25 and 0.50%. Before Wednesday's major policy shift, the FOMC had held short-term interest rates at near zero levels for 56 consecutive meetings, a streak which dated back to December, 2008.
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen pointed to an improving labor market and expectations that long-term inflation will move to its 2% objective in justifying the decision. The Fed Funds Rate is the rate offered by institutions on overnight, interbank loans held at the Fed.
EUR/USD traded in a broad range between 1.0802 and 1.1011 before settling at 1.0826, down 0.0086 or 0.77% on the day. The dollar has closed higher against the euro in each of the last three sessions and five of the last seven. As the likelihood for lift-off gained momentum throughout the year, the dollar surged by nearly 10% against a basket of major currencies. The strength in the dollar has been reflected in its appreciation versus the euro, as well. Since opening 2015 at 1.21, EUR/USD has fallen steadily over the last 11 months. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from Dec. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.138, the high from Oct. 21. 
The modest rate hike provided the latest signal of divergence between the Fed and central banks throughout the euro zone, many of which have cut rates into negative territory in an effort to stave off deflation. At one point on Thursday, the dollar reached its highest level since Dec. 3 when the European Central Bank rattled global foreign exchange markets by instituting limited easing measures with its comprehensive bond buying program. 
Investors now await two FOMC meetings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 for further indications on the Fed's path for normalizing monetary policy. In median projections released on Wednesday, the FOMC anticipates that Fed Funds Rate will reach 1.4% by the end of 2016, before approaching 2.5% by the completion of 2017.The projections suggest that the FOMC could approve as many as four rate hikes next year.
On Thursday, a survey from the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch said there was a 7% chance the U.S. central bank will lift short-term rates again in January. By March, though, the CME Group places the probability at 53% when the Fed will releases its latest long-term economic projections. At the completion of the FOMC's meeting in June, the survey says there's a 26% chance the Fed Funds Rate will be increased to a range between 0.75 and 1.00%, following two additional rate hikes. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.85% to an intraday-high of 99.27 before settling at 99.20. The Fed's upward move is regarded as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields. 
The spread between U.S. and German government bond yields remained relatively flat at 162 basis points. Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell seven basis points to 2.22%, while yields on theGermany 10-Year dipped by eight basis points to 0.60%.

1447,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 16, 2015 07:49PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls mildly, after the Fed approves first rate hike since 2006","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Wednesday reversing territory late in the session, after the Federal Reserve met market expectations by approving its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0866 and 1.1011 before settling at 1.087, down 0.0042 or 0.39% on the session. With the minor losses, the euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar in a week. The dollar is up slightly against the euro since plunging by more than 3% on December 3 after the European Central Bank rattled global foreign exchange markets by only implementing limited easing measures to its comprehensive asset-purchasing program.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from Dec. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
In a unanimous decision, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), lifted its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to a range between 0.25 and 0.50%. Before Wednesday's decision, the FOMC had held short-term interest rates at near zero levels for 56 consecutive meetings, a streak which dated back to December, 2008. In making its decision, the FOMC judged that it has seen considerable improvements in labor market conditions while it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise over its 2% objective over the next several years. The FOMC lowered short-term rates to a zero-bound range seven years ago in an effort to stimulate the economy months after the start of the Financial Crisis.
“This action marks the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression,” Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference in Washington. 
Although Yellen continued to express concern with the current pace of inflation, she reiterated that she expects temporary factors restraining price increases to abate when crashing oil prices stabilize and a stronger dollar levels off. The dollar opened on Wednesday up by approximately 8% against a basket of major currencies. A rate hike is largely viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Despite instituting moderate easing measures at its Governing Council meeting earlier this month, the ECB cut rates on overnight deposits further into negative territory at minus 0.3%. While Yellen said Wednesday that she doesn't think it will be a tool that the Fed will need to use in the near future, she did not discount the possibility of studying its effects.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged by more than 0.80% to settle at 98.29. Yellen also noted that although a number of countries throughout the world have suffered slowing growth due to the rout in commodity prices, she added that the Fed has seen a rebound in Emerging Markets of late. On Wednesday, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index (N:EEM) ETF gained 0.65 or 2% to 33.20.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year inched up one basis point to 2.28%, while yields on the {{23693|Germany 10-Year} }rose four basis points to 0.68%."

1460,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2015 05:45PM ET</span>",EUR/USD as currency traders await critical Fed monetary policy decision,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell considerably on Tuesday, as the dollar held onto gains ahead of Wednesday's highly anticipated announcement from the Federal Reserve, when the U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0903 and 1.1059 in Tuesday's session, before settling at 1.0926, down 0.60% on the session. EUR/USD has been relatively flat since the European Central Bank rattled global foreign exchange markets earlier this month by only approving limited easing measures with its comprehensive asset-purchasing program aimed at staving off deflation in the euro zone. With a little more than two weeks left in the calendar year, the euro is down nearly 10% against the dollar in 2015.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1413, the high from Oct. 14.
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that its CPI Index remained unchanged in November from the previous month, in line with analysts' expectations. On a yearly basis, the CPI index edged up by 0.5% over the last 12 months, considerably above gains of 0.2% in October.
The Core CPI Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, gained 0.2% on the month, also in line with analysts' forecasts. Over the last year, Core CPI has increased by 2.0%, slightly above October's gains of 1.9%. Long-term inflation has remained below the Fed's targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. The Fed's preferred gauge, the Core PCE index, has hovered around 1.25% over the last several months.
In a speech earlier this month, Fed chair Janet Yellen noted that while improving conditions in the U.S. economy have met the Federal Open Market Committee's expectations since it last met in October, she emphasized that long-term inflation still remains considerably below the Fed's target. Although the FOMC estimated that Core PCE inflation will pick up noticeably next year and will rise further in 2017, it also projected that long-term inflation will not reach 2% until 2018.
The Federal Funds Rate, the Fed's benchmark rate offered on interbank, overnight loans, has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since December, 2008, shortly after the start of the Financial Crisis. Any increase of the targeted range for the Federal Funds Rate is expected to be modest at 25 basis points. The FOMC last approved a rate hike in June, 2006. Yellen has continually argued in recent months that the timing of lift-off will pale in comparison to the gradual path of upward moves over the next year.
A rate hike is largely viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 98.34, before closing at 98.21. In early-December, the index surged above 100 to reach a fresh 12-month high.

The currency pair wavered between 1.0946 and 1.1049 in Monday's session, before closing at 1.0993, up 0.12% on the day. EUR/USD has been relatively flat since surging more than 3% on December 3 after the European Central Bank spooked global currency markets by approving only limited easing measures with its comprehensive bond buying program at a closely-watched meeting in Frankfurt. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up by more than 2% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from Dec. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1344, the high from Oct. 21.
Investors have had ample time to price in a rate hike after a host of major policymakers, including Fed chair Janet Yellen, began to send strong signals last month that the U.S. central bank could raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The Federal Open Market Committee opted to leave rates at near-zero levels earlier this fall amid severe global economic struggles, but will likely reverse course on Wednesday as the headwinds restraining economic growth continue to fade. A succession of strong employment data over the last two months has also prompted a wave of hawkish comments from key FOMC members.
On Monday, the CME Group's (O:CME) FedWatch placed the probability of a rate hike at 81.4%, up slightly from Friday's level of 79.4% at the close of trading. The tool, which is based on the CME Group's 30-day Fed Fund futures prices, is used to express the market's view on the likelihood of changes in short-term interest rates.
The Federal Funds Rate, the Fed's benchmark rate offered on interbank, overnight loans, has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since December, 2008, shortly after the start of the Financial Crisis. Any increase in the targeted range for the Federal Funds Rate is expected to be modest at 25 basis points. The FOMC last approved a rate hike in June, 2006. Yellen has continually asserted that the timing of lift-off will pale in comparison to the gradual path of upward moves over the next year.
Along with Wednesday's rate hike decision, the FOMC will also release its quarterly economic projection for the next several years. The projection includes forecasts for U.S. GDP, civilian unemployment and the PCE Price Index, as well as estimates on the timing of its next change in the Federal Funds Rate. In September, the FOMC projected that the Fed Funds Rate would reach 1.4% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2017 respectively, according to its median forecasts. 
A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to take advantage of higher yields. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year, meanwhile, surged by more than eight basis points on Monday to 2.225%. In Friday's bond rout, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell by 14 basis points to 2.132%, suffering one of its worst sessions of the year.

1482,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2015 05:33PM ET</span>","EUR/USD rises moderately in cautious trade, ahead of key Fed decision","Investing.com -- EUR/USD posted modest gains on Friday erasing some of its losses from the previous session, as currency traders continued to await a likely interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its two-day meeting next week. 
The currency pair traded between 1.0927 and 1.1031 before settling at 1.0994, up 0.0053 or 0.49% on the session. After surging by more than 3% in last Thursday's session, EUR/USD has been relatively flat in the six subsequent trading days, moving only percentage points higher. Earlier this week, the euro jumped to one-month highs against the dollar as the aftershocks of a surprising move by the European Central Bank continued to be felt. On December 3, the ECB's Governing Council spooked foreign exchange markets worldwide by only tweaking its comprehensive bond buying program on a limited basis. Many analysts expected ECB president Mario Draghi to introduce widespread easing measures at the meeting in an effort to stave off the risks of deflation. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0549, the low from Dec. 2 and was met with resistance at 1.1041, the high from Dec. 9. 
At next week's closely watched two-day meeting, the FOMC is expected to lift the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25-0.50%. The Fed Funds Rate, the rate which institutions offer on interbank loans at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has remained at near-zero levels for nearly seven years since December, 2008. Almost a decade has passed since the Fed last raised the rate at a meeting in June, 2006.
On Friday, the CME Group's (O:CME) FedWatch placed the probability of a quarter-point hike on Dec. 16 at 81.4%, up from a level which hovered in the 70s before last week's relatively optimistic U.S. jobs report. The U.S. economy added 211,000 nonfarm payrolls in November, while the unemployment rate  remained unchanged at 5.0%. For the year, the labor market has averaged job gains of at least 200,000 a month, far above the 100,000 threshold set by Fed chair Janet Yellen for the next year.
Yellen has continually downplayed the significance of lift-off, placing more importance on the gradual path of rate increases as the Fed normalizes monetary policy. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that FOMC members may struggle to form a consensus on the language in Wednesday's statement regarding the pace of tightening. In September, the FOMC projected that the Fed Funds Rate would reach 1.4% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2017, according to its median forecasts.
An upward move by the Fed is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to take advantage of higher yields. 
Elsewhere, the U.S. Department of Commerce said Core Retail Sales in November increased by 0.6%, following a 0.2% increase a month earlier. The core figure strips out volatile categories such as gasoline, automobile and food sales. Separately, the Labor Department said its Producer Price Index increased by 0.3% in November, following a 0.4% decline a month earlier. The data could provide the retail industry with momentum for the final weeks of the Holiday season.
In Germany, the nation's federal statistics bureau reported that its Consumer Price Index in November ticked up 0.4%, following a 0.3% increase a month earlier. Inflation in the largest economy in the euro zone was boosted by higher costs for food and rent. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.30% to an intraday low of 97.32 before closing at 97.57. Since reaching a 12-month high at 100.60 last week, the index is down by roughly 2.5%.

The currency pair traded between 1.0925 and 1.1025, before settling at 1.0938 down 0.0085 or 0.77% on the session. EUR/USD has been relatively flat since soaring by more than 3% last Thursday in one of its strongest sessions of the year. With the considerable losses, the pair fell back from one-month highs from Wednesday when it closed above 1.10.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1383, the high from Oct. 16.
Currency traders are expected to remain cautious for the next few sessions until the Federal Open Market Committee releases its monetary policy statement at the conclusion of its two-day meeting next Wednesday. The Federal Funds Rate, the Fed's benchmark rate offered on interbank, overnight loans, has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since December, 2008, shortly after the start of the Financial Crisis. Any increase of the targeted range for the Federal Funds Rate is expected to be modest at 25 basis points. The FOMC last approved a rate hike in June, 2006.
A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
In recent weeks, a plethora of Fed members, including Fed chair Janet Yellen have sent strong indications that the Fed will raise rates at the meeting, as headwinds restraining economic growth continue to fade and the labor market nears maximum employment. Last Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said in a relatively positive report that nonfarm payrolls in November increased by 211,000 while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.0%.
Last week, initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose by 13,000 to 282,000, exceeding Econoday consensus estimates of 270,000. While initial claims remain relatively low, it marked the highest reading since late-July. The four-week average for new claims also rose to 270,750, up from 269,250 a week earlier.
Elsewhere, U.S. export prices for November released on Thursday fell by 0.6%, slightly below consensus estimates of a 0.3% decrease. In October, export prices fell mildly by 0.2%. On a yearly basis, export prices dipped by 6.3%, a slight improvement from a 6.7% decline a month earlier.
Import prices, meanwhile, inched down by 0.4% slightly less than consensus estimates of a 0.8% decline. Over the last 12 months, import prices are down by 9.4%, a modest improvement from October's reading when annual prices were down by 10.5%. Over the last year, lower import prices have served as a considerable drag on inflation amid a stronger dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.60 on Thursday to an intraday high of 97.98, before settling at 97.89. Last week, the index eclipsed 100 to reach a 12-month high, before plunging more than 2% on Dec. 3 when the European Central Bank spooked markets by approving limited easing measures at a Governing Council meeting in Frankfurt."

1507,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2015 05:28PM ET</span>","EUR/USD surges more than 1%, as traders brace for likely Fed rate hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged by more than 1.2% on Wednesday cracking 1.10 for the first time in more than a month, as currency traders prepared for a likely rate hike by the Federal Reserve when the U.S. central bank meets in the middle of next week.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0879 and 1.1042, before settling at 1.1026, up 0.0134 or 1.23% on the session. Since falling below 1.06 at the start of the month, the euro has rallied by nearly 5% against the dollar. The euro settled at its highest closing level on Wednesday since Halloween. On a dismal day of trading for the dollar, the greenback also slumped more than 1% on the session against the Japanese Yen to ¥121.53. The dollar is on pace to end the week at its lowest level against the yen in five weeks.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0538, the low from Dec. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1352, the high from Oct. 22.
The euro, though, is expected to retreat again next week if the Federal Open Market Committee approves a long-awaited rate hike at its two day meeting ending on Dec. 16. A bevy of FOMC members, including Fed chair Janet Yellen have sent strong indications that the Fed will raise rates at the meeting, as headwinds restraining economic growth continue to fade and the labor market nears maximum employment. Last Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said in a relatively positive report that nonfarm payrolls in November increased by 211,000 while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.0%.
The Federal Funds Rate, the rate offered on interbank, overnight loans at the Fed, has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since December, 2008, shortly after the start of the Financial Crisis. Any increase of the targeted range for the Federal Funds Rate is expected to be modest at 25 basis points. The FOMC last approved a rate hike in June, 2006.
In September, all but four members of the FOMC judged that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the Federal Funds Rate before the end of the year. The FOMC voted 9-1 to leave rates unchanged in each of the last two meetings, with Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker serving as the lone dissenter both times.
Although Yellen noted in a speech last week that improving conditions in the U.S. economy have met the FOMC's expectations since it last met in October, she emphasized that long-term inflation still remains considerably below the Fed's targeted goal of 2%. In the FOMC's last projection, it estimated that Core PCE inflation will pick up noticeably next year and will rise further in 2017, but will not reach 2% until 2018. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, strips out volatile food and energy prices.
Also, investors continued to digest modest increases in euro zone GDP over the last three months. On Tuesday, the 19-nation bloc in the European Union said third quarter GDP increased by 0.3% on a quarterly basis, amid rising inventories and higher household spending. Analysts expected GDP in the euro area to rise by 0.3% for the period. On a yearly basis, third quarter GDP increased by 1.6%, in line with consensus estimates.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, plunged more than 1.2% on Wednesday to an intraday low of 97.21, before settling near session-lows at 97.33. Last week, the index reached a 2015-high at 100.55, before falling dramatically in Thursday's session when the European Central Bank failed to meet market expectations by approving limited easing measures at a meeting in Frankfurt.

1518,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 08, 2015 05:26PM ET</span>","EUR/USD posts slight gains, as traders await key Fed rate decision","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose moderately on Tuesday erasing the losses from the previous session, as currency traders continued to look ahead to next week's key Federal Reserve meeting where the U.S. central bank is expected to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0796 and 1.0902, before settling at 1.0892, up 0.0057 or 0.53% on the session. It marked the first positive session for EUR/USD since the euro surged more than 3% against the dollar last Thursday after the European Central Bank approved only limited easing measures at a Governing Council's meeting in Frankfurt. After slipping to near eight-month lows earlier this month, the euro is now up versus the dollar by approximately 1.5% over the last month of trading.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0549, the low from Dec. 2 and was met with resistance at 1.0958, the high from Dec. 4.
Currency traders will likely remain cautious over the next week until the Federal Open Market Committee issues a highly-anticipated monetary policy statement following its two day meeting on Dec. 15-16. A host of influential policymakers, including Fed chair Janet Yellen have sent strong indications that it will abandon its current zero-interest rate policy for the first time in almost seven years at next week's meeting.
The Federal Funds Rate, the FOMC's benchmark rate, has remained between zero and 0.25% at every Fed meeting dating back to December, 2008, months after the outbreak of the Financial Crisis. The FOMC has also not approved a rate hike for more than nine years since its met in June, 2006. Any rate hike from the FOMC is expected to be modest, likely just 0.25%, before the Fed engages in a gradual tightening cycle over the next several years.
While Yellen has been pleased with the moderate growth exhibited by the U.S. economy this year, she continues to bemoan the slow pace of inflation that remains considerably below the Fed's long-term targeted goal of 2%. Yellen, along with several colleagues, believe that the transitory factory dragging down inflation will recede once the dollar stabilizes and the price of crude oil recovers. The dollar has appreciated by more than 10% in 2015 and is currently being traded near a one-year high. Crude futures, meanwhile, have crashed more than 80% over the last 18 months amid a glut of supply on global energy markets.
Elsewhere, third quarter GDP in the euro zone increased by 0.3% on a quarterly basis, amid rising inventories and higher household spending. Analysts expected GDP in the euro area to rise by 0.3% for the three-month period. On a yearly basis, third quarter GDP increased by 1.6%, in line with consensus estimates.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, closed on Tuesday down 0.31% at 98.42. Last week, the index reached a 2015-high at 100.55, before falling dramatically in Thursday's session in the wake of the ECB's unexpected move."

1531,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 07, 2015 05:32PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls mildly, as traders react to major policy developments","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Monday, as currency traders continued to react to further indications of major policy divergence between central banks in the U.S. and the euro zone.
The currency pair traded between 1.0796 and 1.0887 before settling at 1.0835, down 0.0045 or 0.41% on the session. Last Thursday, the dollar suffered its worst one-day fall against the euro in six years after the European Central Bank spooked markets by implementing limited easing measures at a closely-watched meeting in Frankfurt. The sharp losses wiped out a month's worth gains from the dollar, which surged in November amid strong hints that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade when it meets again next week.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0549, the low from Dec. 2 and was met with resistance at 1.0983, the high from Dec. 3.
Investors continued to digest data from Friday's relatively optimistic U.S. jobs report, which showed that the U.S. labor market added 211,000 nonfarm payrolls in November, above consensus estimates for gains of 190,000. It followed a robust report a month earlier, placing a December rate hike by the Fed squarely on the table. The U.S. Department of Labor also upwardly revised the October reading by 27,000 to 298,000. For the year as a whole, nonfarm payrolls have increased on average by more than 200,000.
The unemployment rate in November held steady at 5.0%, while average hourly earnings ticked up by 0.2%. Hourly wages, which have been persistently sluggish throughout the year, were expected to increase between 0.1 and 0.3% on the month. The average workweek per all U.S. employees remained unchanged at 34.5 hours.
The fairly positive report followed a relatively dovish speech by Janet Yellen last week at the Economic Club of Washington, where the Fed chair sent further indications that the U.S. economy has improved enough in recent weeks to justify a December interest rate hike.
Citing projections of moderate economic growth on a short-term basis, Yellen noted that improved conditions in the economy could be sufficient enough to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in labor market slack and a rise toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. The Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, has remained under its targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years.
The Federal Funds Rate, the rate which banks loan to each on overnight deposits at the Fed, has remained at record-lows between zero and 0.25% for nearly seven years since December, 2008. Yellen also warned of the perils of holding rates at historically low levels by continuing to delay the start of policy normalization. Further delays could force the Fed to end up having to ""tighten policy relatively abruptly"" in order to keep the economy from overheating, Yellen added. An abrupt tightening, according to the Fed chair, could disrupt financial markets enough to potentially encourage excessive risk taking and even inadvertently push the economy into recession.
A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investor pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.
Following less than dovish comments at Thursday's ECB Governing Council's meeting, president Mario Draghi backtracked on Friday could employ further stimulus measures if needed to stave off risks of deflation. Some analysts anticipate that the two major currencies could fall into parity as early as the start of next year.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.4% to an intraday high of 98.90., before falling back slightly to 98.72. Last week, the index surged to yearly highs at 100.60."

The unemployment rate held steady at 5% in November. Economists had forecast jobs growth of 200,000 and no change in the unemployment rate.
The report hardened expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates for the first time since 2006 at its upcoming meeting on December 15-16. Higher U.S. interest rates would make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
The dollar rose against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.56% to 1.0880 in late trade. The pair still ended the week with gains of 2.81%.
The single currency was also pressured lower after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Friday the ECB would step up stimulus measures if necessary to bring inflation back to target.
The remarks came one day after the euro posted its largest one-day gain against the dollar in more than six years, jumping 3% after the latest easing measures announced by the ECB fell short of market expectations.
The ECB cut the deposit rate to -0.3% and extended the duration of its bond-buying program, falling short of expectations for a more significant move.
The dollar was higher against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.44% to 123.1 late Friday.
The greenback also gained ground against the pound and the Swiss franc, with GBP/USD sliding 0.21% to 1.5112 and USD/CHF up 0.33% to 0.9966.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, advanced 0.46% to 98.27, holding below the seven-and-a-half month peaks of 100.6 set on Thursday. The index ended the week down 1.73%.
In the week ahead, investors will be looking ahead to Friday’s U.S. data on retail sales and inflation for fresh indications on the strength of the economy.
Central bank meetings in the U.K., Switzerland and New Zealand will also be in focus.

1545,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 04, 2015 05:26PM ET</span>","EUR/USD retreats amid strong U.S. jobs report, dovish Draghi remarks","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell back slightly on Friday a session after posting its strongest one-day session in six years, amid a strong U.S. jobs report and dovish comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0836 and 1.0956 on the session before settling at 1.0875, down 0.0067 or 0.61% on the day. On Thursday, the euro surged more than 3% against the greenback after the ECB spooked global currency markets by implementing only limited easing measures at a closely-watched meeting in Frankfurt. In Thursday's session, the euro reached its highest level since early-November, erasing an entire month of losses in a frenzied day of trading.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0549, the low from December 2 and was met with resistance at 1.1473, the high from Oct. 15.
At a highly-anticipated meeting on Thursday, the ECB's governing council left several key interest rates unchanged and opted not to increase the pace of its €60 billion a month quantitative easing program as many analysts expected. Instead, Draghi defied market expectations by only modest changes to the bond buying program, including a plan to extend it by six months through March, 2017.
On Friday, Draghi backtracked by noting that the ECB could employ further stimulus measures if needed, prompting investors to pile back into the euro short positions they abandoned a session earlier. Some analysts anticipate that EUR/USD could fall into parity as early as the start of next year, amid further signals of divergence between the Federal Reserve and the ECB.
Also on Friday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls in November increased by 211,000 on a monthly basis, above consensus estimates for gains of 190,000. It followed a robust report a month earlier when nonfarm payrolls surged by 271,000, placing a December rate hike by the Fed squarely on the table. There were further indications of strength in the labor market on Friday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics upwardly revised the October reading by 27,000 to 298,000.
Fed chair Janet Yellen sent further hints that the U.S. central bank will raise rates in less than two weeks with hawkish comments at two public appearances earlier this week. While testifying before the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill on Thursday morning, Yellen said the economy needs to add fewer than 100,000 jobs a month to absorb the losses of those who fell out of the labor market in recent years. The labor market already appeared on solid footing before Friday's release, averaging gains of more than 200,000 jobs a month.
The unemployment rate  in November held steady at 5.0%, while average hourly earnings ticked up by 0.2%. Hourly wages, which have been persistently sluggish throughout the year, were expected to increase between 0.1 and 0.3% on the month. The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader measure of labor underutilization, inched up 0.1 to 9.9%. The rate, which measures workers that are marginally attached to the market, as well as workers that are not currently looking for employment, stood at 11.4% last year at this time. The measure is a preferred gauge by Yellen, as the chair of the Federal Reserve weighs the nation's employment outlook.
Although Yellen indicated in a speech on Wednesday before the Economic Club of Washington that U.S. inflation remains well-below the Fed's targeted goal, she emphasized that the Fed has seen considerable improvement in the economy and labor market. While Yellen sent strong signals that the Fed could be on the verge of approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade, she noted that unforeseen economic and financial developments over the next few days could sway its decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.75% to an intraday high of 98.62, before retreating to 98.27 at the close."

1555,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2015 06:11PM ET</span>","EUR/USD enjoys strongest one-day move since 2009, following ECB surprise","Investing.com -- The euro enjoyed its strongest one-day move against the dollar in more than six years erasing all of its losses from last month's swoon, as the European Central Bank sent an early Christmas gift to the single currency with a shocking monetary policy decision on Thursday.
In a widely unexpected move, the ECB's governing council left several key interest rates unchanged and opted not to increase the pace of its €60 billion a month quantitative easing program as many expected heading into the closely-watched meeting. Instead, ECB president Mario Draghi unveiled only modest changes to the bond buying program, including a plan to extend it by six months through March, 2017.
Hours later, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen pushed the dollar down even further with hawkish comments at a Congressional hearing on the increasing likelihood that the U.S. central bank will raise short-term interest rates when it meets again in the middle of the month. As a result, the dollar tumbled more than 3% against the euro – its worst one-day fall since March, 2009.
EUR/USD traded in a broad range between 1.0525 and 1.0980 before settling at 1.0936, up 3.08% on the session. Last month, the euro tumbled more than 4.25% against its American counterpart to near eight-month lows, amid strong signals of forthcoming divergence between the major central banks. The dollar's rally prompted some Wall Street analysts to forecast euro-dollar parity as early as the winter of 2016, the first in more than 10 years. The euro, though, rebounded on Thursday to reach its highest level against the greenback since early-November, days before a robust U.S. jobs report bolstered the chances of a rate hike by the Fed for the first time in nearly a decade.
In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill, Yellen said the economy needs to add fewer than 100,000 jobs a month to absorb the losses of those who fell out of the labor market in recent years. In November's U.S. employment report, which will be released by the Department of Labor on Friday morning, analysts expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 5.0% and expect to see solid job gains of 190,000. For the year, nonfarm payrolls have increased on average by more than 200,000 a month. While speaking at a luncheon at the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday, Yellen said the labor market has met the Fed's expectations with its steady progress since the U.S. central bank last met in October.
Yellen's counterpart Draghi, meanwhile, roiled global currency markets on Thursday by delivering less than dovish comments on the state of the ECB's long-term stimulus plan. Heading into the meeting, Draghi sent strong indications the ECB would employ all tools necessary to boost stubbornly low inflation through euro zone, which is hovering around 0.1%. In March, the ECB launched the €1.1 trillion program in an effort to boost economic growth and stave off deflation.
Although the ECB slashed its deposit facility rate by 10 basis points to minus-0.3%, many analysts expected the central bank to cut the rate deeper into negative territory by at least 20 basis points to minus-0.4%. The deposit rate is the rate paid on surplus liquidity or excess reserves institutions deposit at the central bank.
""Let me make this clear we are doing more, because it works, not because it fails,"" Draghi said at a press conference in Frankfurt. ""We concluded that our policies have been effective, in improving credit conditions and financial market conditions, and in the real economy. But the governing council concluded that more stimulus was needed.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 2% to an intraday low of 97.60, before closing near the session lows at 97.87. The index, which inched up to a 12-month high at 100.58 before Draghi's announcement, ended Thursday's session at its lowest closing level in a month.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year surged 13 basis points to 2.31%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year jumped to 0.66%.EUR/GBP surged 1.72% to 0.7221, while USD/JPY fell 0.47% to 122.68. "

1562,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Dec 03, 2015 07:00AM ET</span>",Financial Times Roils Euro Markets Moments Before ECB Rates Decision,"By Victor Golovtchenko
Extreme volatility has caused a stir on the currency markets this European afternoon after a sloppy tweet by the Financial Times. About 10 minutes before the scheduled time for the release of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) statement regarding interest rates, set for 12:45 GMT, the Twitter (N:TWTR) account belonging to the financial newspaper proclaimed that there won’t be a cut in rates.
As a result, short EUR/USD traders headed for the exits and liquidity disappeared from the market for several seconds on some trading platforms in the run up to the official announcement by the ECB.
It would all have played out well for the Financial Times if the European Central Bank had indeed left rates unchanged. Come 12:45 GMT, the official statement read that the Governing Council of the monetary policy setting body of the Eurozone has decided to cut rates further into negative territory.
A screenshot of the tweet by the Financial Times rebuking the earlier announcement
The rollercoaster continued and resulted in a number of swings. Before any of the events described above hit the wires, the EUR/USD was quietly trading around 1.0543. In the aftermath go the ECB tweet, the rate spiked to about 1.0678 only to get hammered and mark a new multi-month low around 1.0515. Profit taking kicked in and a new high at 1.0692 was hit moments after the announcement.

If there was any way to stress test a risk management system for brokers, today was a great day to have a look at how it is faring. A number of brokers have been requiting clients with some platforms freezing in the aftermath of the rate decision.
While the Swiss National Bank black swan was an event on a much greater scale, today’s events show that a number of brokers continue to be experiencing technical difficulties that may hit them hard at some point in the future.
Meanwhile, the team at the Financial Times better get some due diligence applied to its Twitter feed and its sources... unless it has a trading department of its own.

1570,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2015 05:40PM ET</span>","EUR/USD pares losses after falling to 7-month low, ahead of ECB meeting","Investing.com -- EUR/USD wavered on a choppy day of trading after falling to fresh seven-month lows, as investors digested further signals of divergence between central banks in the U.S. and the euro zone. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0551 and 1.0637, before settling at 1.0617, down 0.0011 or 0.09% on the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in five of the last six sessions. More broadly, the euro has lost 3.5% against its American counterpart over the last month and more than 12% for the calendar year. It has been more than 12 years since the pair last traded at parity. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0456, the low from March 16 and was met with resistance at 1.1013, the high from November 3. 
The euro slid to its lowest level against the dollar since mid-April on Wednesday morning when the ADP Research Institute said in its National Employment Report  that U.S. private employers added 217,000 jobs in November, up from 182,000 a month earlier. Analysts expected to see gains of 183,000 in the November report. 
The unexpected surge provides a strong harbinger for Friday's critical U.S. jobs report, the last before the Federal Open Market Committee holds a two day meeting on Dec. 15-16. Hawkish arguments for December lift-off gained momentum early last month after a robust employment report provided signals that the economy could handle the first upward move in rates in nearly a decade. 
In the October report, the U.S. Department of Labor said nonfarm payrolls jumped by 271,000 while the unemployment rate ticked by 0.1 to 5.0%. Analysts expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 5.0% and expect to see solid job gains of 190,000. In terms of average hourly wages, analysts expect an increase of 0.1 to 0.3%, following a major jump of 0.4% in October. Wages have been sluggish for more than a year. 
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday she is looking forward to the day when the U.S. central bank decides to raise short-term interest rates, after remaining at near-zero levels since the depths of the Financial Crisis. In doing so, Yellen said, the symbolic moment ""will be a testament"" to how much the economy has recovered from the Great Recession. In an appearance before the Economic Club of Washington, Yellen also noted that a flurry of economic and financial data since the Fed last met in October has been in line with its expectations for improvements in the labor market. 
The euro pared some losses, though, after Yellen reiterated that the Fed will be cautious in raising rates gradually following lift-off. The Fed chair also emphasized that the U.S. central bank will not be mechanical in its approach by implementing a calendar-based plan for normalization, as some of her predecessors had in previous cycles. 
Investors now turn their attention to Thursday's key European Central Bank meeting, where the Governing Council is widely expected to ramp up a comprehensive €1.1 trillion bond-buying program. The ECB could also cut its benchmark refinancing rate from a record-low of 0.05% and reduce its deposit rate, which is already in negative territory at -0.20%. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged to a yearly-high of 100.41, before falling back to 100.00, up 0.19% on the session.

The BoC said it was maintaining the target for the overnight rate at 0.5%, in line with forecasts.
The bank said the economic outlook was still broadly in line with its October monetary policy report, citing a “complex” transition away from the once-booming resource sector.
“The economy continues to undergo a complex and lengthy adjustment to the decline in Canada’s terms of trade,” the bank said in a statement.
Inflation remains close to the bottom of the bank’s target range, the statement said, due to declines in consumer energy prices. Core inflation is close to 2% as the effects of the lower dollar and the output gap continue to offset each other.
The central bank cut rates twice this year to offset the impact of cheaper oil prices on the economy.
The report came one day after official data showing that Canada emerged from a recession in the third quarter, as a pick-up in exports boosted growth.

The currency pair traded between 1.0563 and 1.0637 before settling at 1.0634, up 0.0067 or 0.63% on the session. Previously, the euro closed down against the dollar in six of the last seven sessions and nine times in the last 12 trading days amid increasing likelihood from the Federal Reserve that it will raise short-term interest rates this month for the first time in nearly a decade.

EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0567, the low from November 27 and 1.0818, the high from Nov. 13. 
The euro could fall further against its American counterpart later this week if the ECB's Governing Council, as expected, institutes a wide range of easing measures aimed at staving off deflation throughout the euro zone. In recent weeks, ECB president Mario Draghi has sent strong indications that the central bank will increase the scope of its comprehensive €60 billion a month bond buying program, tentatively scheduled to run through next September. Last week, Reuters reported that the ECB could also impose a two-tiered penalty next week for banks that leave deposits at its facility. The ECB's benchmark refinancing rate is at a record low of 0.05%, while rates at the deposit facility are already in negative territory at minus-0.20%.
The Federal Open Market Committee, meanwhile, is widely expected to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its two-day meeting on Dec. 15-16, a move which could send the dollar up even higher against the euro. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Charles Evans discussed the importance of moving upward gradually after an initial rate hike, providing further hints that the Fed appears ready to raise rates.

1588,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 01, 2015 12:31AM ET</span>",Yuan's Reserve Currency Status Evokes Mixed Reactions,"By Duncan Hewitt - 

SHANGHAI -- A major milestone in the opening of China’s economy, or a purely symbolic gesture with little real significance? Both reactions were in evidence in China Tuesday, after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) voted to include the country’s currency, the yuan, in its Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket of currencies -- used to guarantee loans to IMF borrowers -- from Oct. 1 next year.
Mainstream media and some international analysts said the move would boost the internationalization of the Chinese currency: “A historic moment, which has stirred debate around the world,” said the populist tabloid Global Times, while Shanghai’s Oriental Morning Post, which filled its front page with the story, stressed that the yuan’s 10.92 percent share of the basket was “higher than the Japanese yen and the British pound.” Overtaking such global currencies clearly excited some: “I stayed up half the night for the news – let’s celebrate,"" said a commenter on online news site The Paper, while another added, ""This is a symbol of global acknowledgment of China’s economic development.""
And some international observers agreed. Analysts at HSBC in Hong Kong wrote in a research note that the move was a “key milestone” for the internationalization of the yuan, ""which should increasingly be looked upon as a ‘major currency.'""
 
Yet there was also some debate about the significance of taking up a small proportion of a basket which as a whole -- as even the Global Times acknowledged -- accounts for only 2.5 percent of global foreign exchange reserves. Andy Xie, a Shanghai-based analyst who was formerly chief economist for Asia at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), was dismissive: “The SDR is just an accounting unit, this has no real world significance,” he told International Business Times. Xie suggested that the move was primarily a publicity coup for the Chinese government aimed at “convincing Chinese people not to buy dollars,” at a time when the country has seen significant outflows of currency following its surprise devaluation of the yuan in August.
Some members of the public were cynical too. One commenter on The Paper suggested that the yuan's proportion of the SDR was actually lower than some experts had predicted, and another questioned whether the Chinese currency really met IMF standards of being “freely tradable and convertible,"" asking: “Can we really freely use it abroad? It seems there are limits.” It was a reference to the regulations that limit Chinese people to converting only $50,000 worth of yuan into foreign currencies each year, while the government has also recently introduced new rules limiting ATM withdrawals by Chinese citizens while overseas.
And even an op-ed piece in the Global Times’ English-language edition suggested there should not be “excessive expectations” about the significance of the event, which it said was “unlikely to substantially increase the proportion of the yuan in global reserves.” It said that the key to whether foreign central banks, and others, would put their money into a currency was the credibility of that currency and the economy of the country that issued it. It noted that the “use of the Japanese yen as a reserve asset has actually fallen since it was included in the SDR basket.”
 
“Further financial reforms are still essential for it [the yuan] to become a global currency,"" the article added. However it stressed that China’s leaders understood this, and a statement from China’s central bank said the IMF's decision would encourage China to “continue to deepen and accelerate economic reforms and financial opening up.” 
Indeed some analysts have said that international support for the IMF's move is designed in part to boost Chinese reformers keen to open the country's economy, including its stock and bond market, to foreign investors. The South China Morning Post also quoted leading brokerage China International Capital Corporation (CICC) as saying the yuan's inclusion in the SDR was part of an “irreversible push towards financial liberalisation, which will have a profound impact on China's economy."" The China Daily, meanwhile, quoted one expert as saying China’s central bank would now “come under immense pressure to be more transparent, and improve its way of communicating with international markets,” following criticisms of its handling of the devaluation of the yuan earlier this year.
Li-Gang Liu, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Bank in Hong Kong, said in a note that the yuan’s entry into the SDR was “unlikely to bring significant fund inflows in the near term, but we believe overseas investors will increase their assets allocated in CNY bonds over the longer term."" Meanwhile HSBC analysts said the IMF’s decision would boost confidence and usage of the yuan because it “serves as a sign of quality assurance for global users that the currency in question is very liquid and is stable as a store of value.”
 
The HSBC report also predicted that the move would boost reform efforts in China, and would give the nation's leaders ""further confidence to let the exchange rate become more market driven,” saying this could be the ""most important result"" of the IMF’s decision.
HSBC predicted the central bank would likely allow the yuan to trade in a slightly wider band against the U.S. dollar than its current range of +/- 2 percent a day, though it said that in the short term this could lead to “some further depreciation pressure” on the yuan. Noting that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates this month, which would likely encourage more Chinese investors to put money into dollars, it predicted the yuan could fall to about 6.5 to the dollar by the end of the year, from its current level of about 6.35 and said ""more weakness with greater two way volatility"" could be expected next year."

1592,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2015 02:02PM ET</span>","The IMF adds yuan to its reserve currency basket, effective next October","Investing.com -- The International Monetary Fund, as expected, approved reserve-currency status for China's yuan on Monday by adding the Renminbi to its Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies.
While completing its regular five-year review of the basket of currencies that comprise the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), the IMF's executive board determined that the Renminbi (RMB) is a freely usable currency, which met all of its existing criteria for inclusion in the reserve basket. The move will be effective on October 1, 2016, to provide sufficient lead time for the IMF and allow its members enough time to adapt to the changes, the fund said in a statement.
“The Executive Board's decision to include the RMB in the SDR basket is an important milestone in the integration of the Chinese economy into the global financial system,"" IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said in a statement. ""It is also a recognition of the progress that the Chinese authorities have made in the past years in reforming China’s monetary and financial systems. The continuation and deepening of these efforts will bring about a more robust international monetary and financial system, which in turn will support the growth and stability of China and the global economy.”
The SDR gives IMF member countries the right to obtain any of the currencies in the basket to meet balance of payments needs, rebalance their reserves and settle the debts they owe to the fund. Currently, the basket is composed of four currencies -- the Dollar, euro, British pound and Japanese yen. By next October, the yuan will represent approximately 11% of the reserve basket, above both the pound and yen, which will each make up about 8%. In addition, the Dollar will remain as the predominant SDR currency, representing about 41% of the basket, while the euro will make up the final 30%.
There is approximately $280 billion in SDRs created and allocated to members of the IMF, according to the fund. Although an SDR is not viewed as an official currency, IMF members can exchange them for currencies that make up the basket through deals with other SDR holders.
In U.S. afternoon trading, USD/CNY inched up 0.0040 or 0.06% to 6.3984."
1593,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 30, 2015 11:01AM ET</span>",A historic moment for China’s renminbi,"By Carter Dougherty - 

The International Monetary Fund will today usher China's renminbi into the elite club of currencies that make up the organization’s basic unit of exchange. While being a component of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights move is a political plum for Beijing, it won't drive the internationalization of Chinese financial markets, which will turn on China's willingness to allow foreigners to invest in its largely insulated bond market.
The IMF’s top governing body is set to approve the inclusion of the Chinese currency into the unit of exchange, which the IMF uses to track its own reserves and holdings of its members, and is sometimes used by members for their own transactions. Over the past year, Beijing had pushed strongly for the change, which nominally puts it in the same category as the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the euro.
“The near-term effects will be the increased prestige and standing of the Chinese economy and the recognition that China has become more closely integrated into the global economy,” said Bill Witherell, chief global economist at Cumberland Advisors.
Greater use of the Chinese yuan by stewards of central bank reserves and global asset managers won't come automatically as a result of the IMF's decision. That development, which would be a sea change in international currency markets long dominated by the U.S. dollar, depends far more on China’s willingness to continue the slow -- some might say excruciatingly slow -- process of opening its capital markets to foreign investors.
 China Overview | FindTheData
Investors mostly swap currencies so they can purchase assets issued in another currency than their own, rather than for pure speculation. China is notable for having a large domestic capital market that's largely off-limits for foreigners, a policy that reflects Beijing’s reluctance cede power to uncontrollable economic forces -- and one that limits appetites for its currency.
The internationalization of China’s bond market, for example, is not even 13 years old. In 2002, China began licensing some foreign firms to participate in the market, which is dominated by domestic banks. Other piecemeal measures followed over the years. In July, China ended a requirement that foreign sovereign asset buyers, such as central banks, obtain government approval to purchase bonds in markets on the mainland.
Foreigners have had access to the much smaller “dim-sum” market of offshore renminbi-denominated bonds for some time. But the international use of China's currency will turn on access to its domestic bond market, worth about 35.9 trillion renminbi -- about $5.6 trillion -- at the end of 2014, according to Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
“Investors seeking access to China’s strong growth via the bond market continue to face hurdles, including a lack of familiarity with the range of bonds available, restrictions on who can invest and how, and other aspects of the Chinese bond market,” Goldman wrote in a recent research report.
 CNY to USD Exchange Rate | FindTheData
While the decision follows a review by the IMF staff, the inclusion of the yuan in its official basket of currencies has a strong whiff of politics to it.
In 2009, the head of the People’s Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, called for the IMF unit to become a “super-sovereign reserve currency.” While visiting Washington last month, President Xi Jinping publicly thanked the United States for supporting Beijing’s bid for including the yuan.
IMF rules dictate that a currency be “freely usable,” a debatable proposition in the case of China, which has faced widespread accusations of manipulating its currency to boost exports and still imposes capital controls. Trading in China's currency is emerging in fits and starts, with a hub for it in Hong Kong operating and other efforts in London gaining traction. The IMF staff acknowledged the limited global use of the Chinese currency, but emphasized that the organization’s governing board has wide latitude to make such decisions.
China’s devaluation of its currency in August was widely viewed as a demonstration that Beijing is ready for a more flexible exchange rate structure.
Edwin Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the IMF’s managing director, former French finance minister Christine Lagarde, has bowed to Chinese demands despite the economic facts. Although data on reserve currencies are spotty when it comes to China, the nation's currency is a negligible part of the mix, valued at $11.5 trillion in mid-2015, according to the IMF’s own figures.
“Lagarde appears to have decided to give the Chinese authorities the political trophy of inclusion of their currency in the SDR basket and to take personal credit for this action,” Truman wrote in a blog post.
Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, pointed out that government restrictions on a currency’s usage have never been an absolute bar to being included in the IMF’s basket. Japan’s yen and the now-defunct French franc were both covered by capital controls at times, he noted.
The change at the IMF would take effect in about a year. The renminbi is China's currency, while its unit of exchange is the yuan."

1604,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 30, 2015 01:31AM ET</span>",Euro Under Pressure,"By Avaneesh Pandey - 

The euro is heading toward its biggest monthly decline against the dollar since March and its lowest level in over 8 months amid speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) will unveil further stimulus measures to boost the eurozone’s economy and raise inflation.
Since the start of the year, the 19-nation currency has dropped over 12 percent against the greenback, which itself has edged up to an eight and a half month high against a basket of global currencies -- bolstered by a growing belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December, its first such move in nine years.
“Euro selling will see its climax going into the ECB meeting, with a knee-jerk reaction to the outcome possibly sending it to new lows for the year close to $1.03,” Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, told Bloomberg. “The euro will likely see its trough in January-March but chances will grow for its rebound as expectations for U.S. rate hikes will be more moderate next year.”
On Monday, the euro dropped to $1.0570 -- recovering slightly from a seven-month low of $1.0566 it hit last week. So far this month, the currency has weakened 3.8 percent against the dollar -- the biggest monthly drop since a 4.2 percent decline in March, when the ECB announced its 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) asset-buying program. The euro was last at $1.0589 at 1:21 a.m. EST.
According to recent reports, the ECB, during a policy meeting later this week, is expected to finalize and inject more monetary stimulus into eurozone economies by expanding its bond-buying program. A decision on interest rates and any further measures will be announced Thursday.
In recent weeks, ECB chief Mario Draghi has primed the markets and investors for further actions, reiterating that the bank will do whatever it must to boost inflation -- underscoring a persistent concern among euro area economies that inflation in the bloc, currently at 0.1 percent, will fail to meet the ECB’s 2 percent target by 2017.
“The ECB has prepared the markets for a package of measures and cannot afford to under-deliver or financial conditions will re-tighten,” Ken Wattret, chief euro area market economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London, told Bloomberg."
1605,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2015 08:40PM ET</span>",IMF's yuan inclusion signals less risk taking in China,"By Pete Sweeney and Krista Hughes
SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When the International Monetary Fund agrees on Monday to add the Chinese yuan to its reserves basket in the biggest shake-up in more than three decades, the IMF can afford itself a congratulatory nod.
By acknowledging the yuan as a major global currency alongside the dollar, euro, yen, and pound, as is widely expected, IMF members will endorse the efforts of China's economic reformers and by doing so hope that will spur fresh change in China.
But Chinese policy insiders and international policymakers say reforms may not continue at the breakneck pace of recent months. In addition, Chinese sources suggest adding the yuan to the IMF basket leaves economic conservatives better positioned to resist further significant reform in a reminder of the period following China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
A slowing in the pace has implications for those who bet that making the yuan a global reserve currency will give it a boost. The yuan has fallen almost 3 percent against the dollar this year, on course for its biggest annual fall since its landmark 2005 revaluation.
The IMF decision will remove a key incentive – bolstering national pride – that reformers used to push otherwise reluctant conservatives to support reforms.
More importantly, however, are worries in Beijing that the rickety economy can't handle more aggressive reform that allows a freer flow of currency across China's borders.
Beijing is already rapidly losing a taste for more experimentation with capital flows, say the sources - economists involved in policy discussions who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.
After the stock market buckled more than 40 percent in the summer – which many blamed on nefarious foreign capital – regulators have made it harder for money to leave China to counter yuan selling pressure and have intervened heavily in onshore and offshore currency markets. Not just conservatives, but  more liberal economists are calling for a pause.
""Our ability to control financial risk has yet to be improved,"" said a senior economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), an influential Beijing think-tank.
""Any rush to open up the capital account completely could be unfavorable for controlling financial risks ... we will definitely be very cautious.""
The IMF's executive board, representing the Fund's 188 members, is likely to approve inclusion of the yuan in the reserve basket, known as Special Drawing Rights (SDR). An IMF staff report and Managing Director Christine Lagarde have endorsed the idea. The United States has suggested it will not stand in the way.
The SDR basket determines the currency mix countries like Greece receive when the IMF disburses financial aid. Some economists predict inclusion will boost demand for the yuan, or renminbi (RMB), by more than $600 billion.
Chinese media predicted entry will draw over 1 trillion yuan ($156 billion) of foreign money into China bonds. Both predictions rest on assumptions more capital account opening is on the way.
""The RMB (will be) included so the reform-oriented forces can keep the upper hand; there's no way back now for the conservative members in the party,"" said an IMF policymaker from an advanced economy, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Seeing the SDR decision as the goal of China's reforms is ""as if the tail were wagging the dog,"" said Otaviano Canuto, who represents Brazil and other Latin American and Caribbean countries on the IMF board.
""The expectation is that the eventual inclusion of the RMB is a moment in the process ... (which) is being undertaken and implemented for itself, because it's part of the development of the Chinese economy,"" he said.
""WHY WOULD YOU TAKE MORE RISKS?""
China has pushed to make the yuan more international, setting up swap arrangements with countries so trade can be settled in the currency and China has said it will push ahead with financial reform. It has widened the yuan's trading band and this year went a long way to freeing up interest rates.
But Chinese policy advisers have always been divided, sometimes publicly, on how far China should go in opening up its borders to foreign capital; while few use vocabulary that rejects general reform principles, many domestic policy advisors - including some otherwise supportive of economic liberalization - warn throwing open the gates to cross-border flows would be destabilizing.
They have many quiet allies among China's state-owned banks and other inefficient industries, which fear that a freer market for capital will expose them to international competition and put them out of business.
Foreign access to financial markets is still tightly restricted and of late regulators have reversed some measures that were designed to make it easier to move the yuan offshore.
""The (Chinese) reform camp has been selling (IMF inclusion) partly on the basis of international prestige, in particular equaling Japan,"" said Derek Scissors, chief economist at China Beige Book.
""What is the reform movement going to say now to move reform forward ... if the IMF has already recognized China as an internationalized currency?"" asked Scissors. ""Why would you take more risks?""
Some see parallels with China's WTO entry in 2001, in which Chinese reformers used entry negotiations as an incentive to push through painful state sector restructuring, only to see their agenda sidelined shortly after inclusion.
China's retreat from its WTO commitments was widely blamed on the retirement in 2003 of reform-minded Premier Zhu Rongji. Current leading reformer Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of the central bank who has said the yuan will be basically convertible by this year, is at 67 years old already past the typical retirement age for senior Communist Party officials.
""Previous wording was 'accelerating' convertibility, now it's 'making RMB convertible in an orderly manner,'"" said an economist, of the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), who is also close to policy discussions. He said China was well aware capital account liberalization elsewhere - in particular Japan - has been blamed for causing ""serious crises.""

""The most important thing is to handle domestic issues well; we cannot afford to see another collapse of the stock market.""

1610,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 29, 2015 03:31AM ET</span>",Yuan To Become Reserve Currency,"By Avaneesh Pandey -

On Monday, China’s currency -- the yuan -- will most likely join the International Monetary Fund’s basket of reserve currencies, known as Special Drawing Rights, according to media reports.
The IMF is expected to approve the yuan’s inclusion into the basket of elite currencies when it meets Monday, and its chief Christine Lagarde has already endorsed the move, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The SDR -- a virtual currency whose value is currently based on the yen, euro, pound and dollar -- is an international reserve asset that the IMF uses for emergency lending to its members. While SDR is not a freely traded currency, it serves as an international reserve asset. The IMF issues its crisis loans valued in SDRs, which came in handy during the financial crisis when it helped bolster member nations’ official reserves.
Until recently, China’s demand to include the yuan in the IMF’s basket of reserve currencies had been mostly rebuffed, as it was considered too tightly controlled. The yuan, which recently surpassed the Japanese yen to become the fourth most used currency in global transactions, still remains tightly controlled by the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank.
While the inclusion of the yuan would be a public acknowledgement of China’s clout in the global economy, it would also put further pressure on the government to take steps toward creating a more open, market-oriented economy.
“Domestically, it’s far from certain whether the SDR status could force other, structural overhauls,” Zhang Ming, a senior economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Journal.
The last time the SDR basket was modified was in 2000, when the euro replaced the German deutschemark and the French franc.
Currently, the total value of SDRs is approximately $280 billion. Following its last review in 2010 -- which factored in currency use in international trade -- the dollar accounted for 41.9 percent of the SDR, while the euro, the pound and the yen accounted for 37.4 percent, 11.3 percent and 9.4 percent respectively. It is not yet clear what the yuan’s weight in the basket would be."
1611,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2015 02:53PM ET</span>","EUR/USD remains near seven-month low, ahead of next week's ECB meeting","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell slightly on a light day of post-Thanksgiving trading, as currency traders look ahead to next week's European Central Bank meeting for further signals of potential divergence in monetary policies in the U.S. and the euro zone.
The currency pair wavered between 1.0596 and 1.0638 before settling at 1.0596, down 0.0015 or 0.15% on the session. The euro remained near seven-month lows against the dollar after closing under 1.07 for the sixth straight session. The dollar ends the week with a three-day winning streak against the euro and has closed higher in five of the last six sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0591, the low from November 23 and was met with resistance at 1.1096, the low from Oct. 28.
The euro could fall even further later next week if the ECB's Governing Council institutes further easing measures to stimulate the economy and bolster inflation at its meeting in Frankfurt. Over the last few weeks, ECB president Mario Draghi has sent strong indications that the central bank could increase the scope of its comprehensive EUR 60 billion a month quantitative easing program at the meeting. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the ECB could also impose a two-tiered penalty next week for banks that leave deposits at its facility. The ECB's benchmark refinancing rate is at a record low of 0.05%, while rates at the deposit facility are already in negative territory at minus-0.20%.
Less than two weeks later, the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time in more than nine years. The rate, which banks charge on interbank overnight loans at the Fed, has remained at a near-zero level since December, 2008. The potential for sharp divergence between monetary policies in the U.S. and the euro zone has sent the dollar soaring, as foreign investors look to pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.3% to an intraday high of 100.26. The index is now points away from its 12-months high at 100.38 in mid-March. For a stretch of five sessions in mid-March the index remained near 100, before falling back when the Fed opted to leave short-term rates unchanged. Over the last year of trading, the index has spiked nearly 14%.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell one basis point to 2.22%, while yields in the Germany 10-Year lost one basis point to 0.46%. On Thursday, yields on 5-Year German bunds approached negative 0.2%, falling to all-time record lows."

1619,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 26, 2015 10:45PM ET</span>",Euro Heading For Parity With Dollar,"By Mike Brown -

Analysts at Goldman Sachs (N:GS) believe the euro could be heading for parity with the dollar. The euro dropped below $1.06 on Thursday, following an exclusive report by Reuters that claimed the European Central Bank (ECB) had been considering a variety of options before the next ECB meeting.
The ECB is expected to decide at the meeting whether to expand its current program of quantitative easing. The bank could also potentially cut interest rates further. ""They expect EUR/US$ to go to 0.95 over the next 12-months but this level could be reached sooner,"" said an outlook from Goldman. ""Until the ECB meeting they expect 1.05 and parity by year-end.""
One of the options the ECB has been considering, Reuters claimed, was a two-tier bank charge on those who seek to keep their money with the ECB. This, the FT reports, would help alleviate major charges for commercial banks.
A source speaking to Reuters voiced their concerns about the eurozone's near-stagnation, and the need for action at the ECB meeting. ""We have deflation, so you have to do something,"" said the source. But what the outcome will be after a few years is uncertain, the source explained.
On the other side of the pond, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates. The ECB released a stability review on Wednesday that pointed to both the lack of eurozone growth and the impending rate hike were ""of particular concern"" to the eurozone's stability.
The question is whether surprises have already been priced into the euro ahead of the ECB meeting. ""The market is short of euros and is braced for a negative surprise from the ECB meeting,"" said Kit Juckes at Soc Gen to the Financial Times. ""If you've priced-in a surprise, how can you be surprised?"""

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2015 09:00AM ET</span>",Bad Saudi PR fuels riyal devaluation talk,"By Andrew Torchia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Speculation that Saudi Arabia could devalue its currency may owe more to a poor public relations effort by Saudi authorities than to the economic pressures on the kingdom.
Riyadh has the tools available to protect itself as low oil prices push the current account and budget balances of the world's top crude exporter deep into deficit, senior bankers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf said.
In private conversations with Reuters this week, the bankers - many of whom are in contact with Saudi authorities - said Riyadh may detail a strategy to cope with an era of cheap oil as soon as next month, when the finance ministry presents the 2016 budget plan. The prospect of a riyal devaluation remains far-fetched, they said.
Political sensitivities and a culture of government secrecy have so far prevented officials from publicly discussing the likely policy options, keeping financial markets guessing about Riyadh's response to the sustained oil price slump. At $45.71 per barrel, Brent crude is down 20 percent this year after tumbling from above $115 last year. 
Nervous investors are hedging against the risk that Saudi Arabia could abandon its three-decade-old peg of 3.75 riyals to the dollar. The riyal fell in the forwards market this week to its lowest since 1999, after the price of credit default swaps covering Saudi sovereign debt surpassed those insuring against a Philippines default.
""A lot of uncertainty has to do with the size of the fiscal deficit expected this year,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. As the government introduces spending cuts and other deficit-curbing measures, ""this should help ease worries"", she said.
The central bank and finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on policy. 
Malik said steps expected next year, including an end to one-off state salary bonuses and the introduction of a land tax, could cut the budget deficit to around 10 percent of gross domestic product from the current 20 percent.
That would allow Saudi Arabia to slow the drawdown of its foreign assets, a major focus for the pessimists.
Saudi spending, reserves http://link.reuters.com/gap75t
APOCALYPTIC
The kingdom faces tougher economic times, the regional bankers said - but not to the point of being forced to break its currency peg.
Their view is at odds with some analysts at major Western financial institutions, who are discussing a looming Saudi devaluation in apocalyptic terms.
""If Saudi cannot resist the gravitational forces created by a persistently strong U.S. dollar and de-pegs the riyal to follow the Russian or Brazilian currencies, oil could collapse to $25 per barrel,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) wrote this week.
In fact Riyadh is determined to avoid devaluation at almost any cost, the Gulf bankers said. The resulting market panic and import cost surge would outweigh the benefit to state finances from higher oil revenue after conversion from dollars to riyals.
Saudi Arabia imports much of its food, consumer goods and machinery, and their rapid price inflation could stoke political discontent in the event of a devaluation.
The state has reserves to support its currency for years to come. With Brent averaging $57.55 a barrel between March and September, the central bank's foreign assets shrank at an annual rate of $87 billion, leaving it holding $647 billion. 
Even if the asset depletion accelerated, it would take several more years to reach $225 billion, or a generous 18 months of import cover - twice the cushion most nations enjoy.
Such arithmetic does little to ease market jitters, however, when Saudi officials have yet to explain how they will handle the pressure. Rare public pronouncements have so far been confined to general assurances of economic health, leaving many investors unconvinced.
Earlier this month, as dwindling oil receipts drove interbank money rates to their highest levels since 2009, the central bank governor brushed off what he called a ""slight"" rise in rates, insisting that banks had liquidity aplenty. Borrowing costs have since risen further.
DOMESTIC SENSITIVITY
In a country renowned for government secrecy, reluctance to engage with the markets may have been heightened by leadership changes ushered in with new King Salman's accession in January.
His son, Mohammed bin Salman, has taken over much of the economic policy apparatus just as it grapples with an oil price slump whose extent may have caught officials off-guard. The last serious bout of market speculation on a Saudi devaluation was handled by their predecessors, in 1998.
Another reason to keep likely countermeasures under wraps is their political sensitivity. Curbing public sector wages, trimming subsidies and slowing construction projects would hit the lavish welfare policies that have helped maintain Saudi Arabia's social peace.
In a sign of their delicacy, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi has toned down comments last month that domestic energy prices may have to rise. He softened his stance a week later with assurances that there was no dire need for reform, and that citizens' welfare would be protected.
However, domestic political hurdles will not deter Riyadh from any necessary steps to shore up financial stability, according to those in regular contact with its officials. 
Soon after next month's budget announcement, the government is expected to publish a multi-year blueprint for economic development in a cheap-oil context, said a senior executive at a major Saudi financial firm.

""This will answer many of the questions people have and should show that the talk of devaluation is overblown,"" he said.

Earlier this month, Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer said he believes that long-term inflation will move back toward its targeted goal of 2% as temporary factors from a stronger dollar and weaker energy prices continue to recede.
Currency traders also reacted to a report from Reuters that the European Central Bank could increase the scope of its bond-buying program and impose a two-tiered penalty for banks that leave deposits at its facility. The ECB's Governing Council will convene next at a highly-anticipated meeting next week.
Elsewhere, the factory sector is showing signs of renewed strength after durable goods orders surged by 3% in October, significantly above consensus estimates of gains of 1.5%. Orders in the airline sector soared 200% in connection with a prominent air show in Dubai. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, fell back to 91.3 from a mid-month reading of 93.1, ahead of the start of the holiday shopping season on Friday. A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped to an intraday high of 100.22 before closing at 99.78, up 0.10% on the session. On Monday, the index eclipsed 100 for the first time since mid-April."
1633,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2015 11:21AM ET</span>",American Airlines stops accepting payments in Argentine pesos,"By Hugh Bronstein
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) has stopped accepting Argentine pesos to pay for tickets due to currency controls that make it hard to convert receipts into U.S. dollars, local media and one of the airline's sales agents said on Wednesday. 
""That's the policy at this moment. It started two days ago,"" said an American Airlines sales agent contacted by Reuters.
A local spokesman for the airline, the world's largest, could not be reached immediately for comment.
Businesses have long complained about difficulty in accessing the currency exchange market in Argentina due to policies enacted by leftist President Cristina Fernandez, who will step down on Dec. 10 after two terms in office.
Conservative opposition candidate Mauricio Macri won Sunday's presidential election, promising to ditch trade and currency controls as part of a program of free-market reforms welcomed by big business.
Asked how long the prohibition, which includes cash and credit and debit card payments in pesos, would last, the American Airlines ticket agent said, ""We don't know.""
American Airlines, however, will continue accepting payments from customers in Argentina made on foreign credit cards, the agent said. Local media reported that ticket sales made before the airline's prohibition on Argentine cards would be honored.
The situation mirrors that in Venezuela where airlines have about $3.7 billion in ticket sales trapped because of the socialist nation's 12-year-old currency control system, the International Air Transport Association said in June.
""There is a risk that Argentina is headed down the same path as Venezuela. Both countries top a list of misguided policies and decisions that we are engaging governments across the region to reverse,"" Tony Tyler, chief executive officer of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said in a speech in Puerto Rico this month.
The IATA, which is the trade association for the world's airlines, would like to talk about policy changes with Macri.
""We are seeking to meet the new government as soon as it is in office to find a solution that will preserve connectivity and the vital economic benefits it brings,"" Tyler said.
Alfonso Prat-Gay, a former foreign exchange chief at JP Morgan, is to be Macri's finance minister.

Argentina's official peso  was at 9.675 per dollar on Wednesday, 57.3 percent stronger than the black market rate at which many transactions in Argentina are made. Under Fernandez, the central bank intervenes to keep the official rate strong. Macri says he will allow the two rates to converge.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.35% at 100.04. It earlier rose to 100.22, a level not seen since April 13.
The U.S. Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that new home sales rose by 10.7% to 495,000 units last month.
The report came shortly after the U.S. Department of Labor said first time jobless claims declined by 12,000 last week to 260,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 272,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 2,000 last week.
A separate report showed that durable goods orders jumped 3.0% in October, easily surpassing forecasts for 1.5%. Core durable goods orders, excluding volatile transportation items, rose 0.5%, beating expectations for an increase of 0.3%.
The upbeat data added to already growing expectations the Federal Reserve will raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade at its December 15-16 meeting.
Most Fed officials believe there is a strong case to begin raising interest rates next month, as long as U.S. economic data does not disappoint in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, the euro sank to a fresh seven-month low after Reuters reported that the European Central Bank is looking at broadening the scope of its bond-buying program or implementing a two-tier penalty charge on banks that leave cash with the ECB.
U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and Friday will be a half day, resulting in thin liquidity conditions.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Monday she and her colleagues hope and expect the economy will continue to expand and if that is the case, it will be appropriate to raise interest rates.
""Most of us expect the pace of that normalization to be gradual,"" Yellen said in a letter to Ralph Nader released by the Federal Reserve.

Also on Monday, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors scheduled a closed-door meeting, held under expedited procedures, to review the discount rates charged by its regional banks.
The discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank lending facilities, also known as the discount window. When the Fed increases the discount rate, it makes the borrowing costs for banks more expensive, decreasing the money supply in the system.
The discount rate differs from the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate banks lend to one another on overnight loans for funds maintained at the Federal Reserve. In February, 2010, the Fed increased the spread between the discount rate and the top of the target range of the Federal Funds Rate to 50 basis points. It came nearly two years after the Fed reduced the spread to 25 points in March, 2008, in an effort to bolster liquidity.
The Federal Funds Rate has remained at a level between zero and 0.25% for nearly seven years, since December, 2008. The announcement of the previously unscheduled meeting helps raise speculation that the U.S. central bank will lift the Fed Funds Rate when it meets next on Dec. 15-16. The Fed last held an unscheduled meeting in December, 2012. An initial rate hike is viewed as bearish for gold, which is not attached to dividends or interest rates and struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets.

1665,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2015 05:25PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls sharply, amid further signs of Fed-ECB policy divergence","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Friday continuing its push back to parity, amid further indications of policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0641 and 1.0738, before settling at 1.0648, down 0.0086 or 0.81% on the session. With the sharp losses EUR/USD dropped to near-seven month lows from earlier in the week. For the week, EUR/USD lost roughly 1.2% after closing in the red on three of five sessions. More broadly, the euro has lost nearly 6.5% against the dollar since mid-October when it nearly hit 1.15. 
More than a decade has passed since the euro last fell to parity with the dollar. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0615, the low from November 18 and was met with resistance at 1.1489 the high from Oct. 15. 
In a closely watched speech at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress on Friday, ECB president Mario Draghi sent perhaps his strongest indications yet that the bank will approve further easing measures next month, likely by moving its deposit rate deeper into negative territory. At negative 0.20%, the rate is already at a record low. The minutes from the ECB's November meeting, released this week, showed that inflation in the euro zone remains well below the bank's target, in spite of numerous easing measures implemented by the bank in recent months to inject liquidity into the system. 
In March, the ECB launched a comprehensive €60 billion a month asset purchasing program (APP) intended to run through September, 2016. Draghi has also hinted that the ECB could expand the scope of the quantitative easing program when its Governing Council meets again on Dec. 3. 
""The level of the deposit facility rate can also empower the transmission of APP, not least by increasing the velocity of circulation of bank reserves,"" Draghi said in the speech. ""If we decide that the current trajectory of our policy is not sufficient to achieve our objective, we will do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible. That is what our price stability mandate requires of us.""
Elsewhere, currency traders digested further signals that the Federal Open Market Committee could raise short-term interest rates at its monetary policy meeting next month. On Friday morning, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president James Bullard argued that he expects inflation to move back to the Fed's targeted goal of 2%, if the cost of oil stabilizes and other prices continue to increase at its current rate over the next year. Following last month's stellar U.S. jobs report, a host of FOMC members including Fed chair Janet Yellen have hinted that conditions in the economy have improved enough to justify a rate hike. 
A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.50% on Friday to close at 99.65, near session highs.

1675,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2015 05:34PM ET</span>","EUR/USD rallies as Fed hike, weak euro zone inflation remain in focus","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rallied considerably on Thursday to move above near seven month lows, as the timing of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve and weak inflation projections from the European Central Bank remained in focus.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0656 and 1.0763 before settling at 1.0734, up 0.0074 or 0.69% on the session. With the sharp gains, the euro closed above 1.07 against the dollar for the first time in four sessions. Over the last month of trading, though, the euro has still lost more than 5% in value against its American counterpart.

Currency traders continued to react to the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes from its October minutes on Wednesday when the U.S. central bank sent stronger indications that it could raise short-term interest rates when it meets again next month. The minutes showed that the majority of the committee's members judged that significant global financial risks had diminished enough to strongly consider tightening monetary policy before the end of the year. In each of the last two meetings the FOMC has voted 9-1 to hold its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current rate between zero and 0.25%. The rate, which banks use for interbank overnight loans at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has remained at a near-zero level since December, 2008. Nearly a decade has passed since the Fed last raised short-term rates.
Investors also digested the minutes from the ECB's Governing Council's November meeting, which revealed that the bank fears that the risks of deflation have become more pronounced, amid a slowing of core inflation. The ECB's downward revision of its inflation outlook exacerbate concerns that the central bank may not have enough tools at its disposal to reach its targeted goal of 2% inflation over the next year. Investors await the Governing Council's next meeting on Dec. 3 for a potential interest rate cut and an expansion of the euro zone's comprehensive asset-purchasing program possibly needed to help stave off negative inflation.

Appearing on a panel alongside New York Fed president William Dudley and Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart indicated that disruptions in the global financial markets have subsided enough for the Fed to strongly consider a rate hike in December. The Fed's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% for nearly seven years since December, 2008.
""I am comfortable with moving off zero soon, conditioned on no marked deterioration in economic conditions,"" Lockhart said at the Clearing House Payments System Risk Symposium in New York. ""I believe it will soon be appropriate to begin a new policy phase.""
Mester reiterated her views that conditions in the economy have improved enough to handle a modest rate increase. While the president of the Federal Reserve of Cleveland does not own a vote at the December meeting, she will regain one in the Fed's next cycle.
Dudley, meanwhile, noted that he does not expect to see any unpredictable market reactions when the Fed eventually decides to normalize policy since the potential move has been so well-documented in recent weeks. The New York Fed has a number of tools at its disposal to help adjust the Fed Funds Rate once the decision is made.

At a critical meeting in September, the FOMC voted 9-1 to hold the rate between zero and 0.25%, amid significant concerns abroad.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0631 and 1.0691 before settling at 1.0645, down 0.0042 or 0.39% on the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in three straight sessions and four of the last six trading days. After a robust monthly U.S. jobs report strengthened the case for an imminent rate hike by the Federal Reserve earlier this month, EUR/USD has closed below 1.085 in each of the last eight sessions. More broadly, the euro has fallen by more than 6% against its American counterpart over the last 30 days of trading. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0519, the low from April 13 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday that its Consumer Price Index  (CPI) rose by 0.2% for the month of October amid considerable increases in Medical Care, Education and Vacation prices. Further gains, though, were restrained by modest increases in home prices, which rose by 0.2% after a 0.3% gain in September. Overall, analysts expected monthly gains in the October CPI of 0.2%.
On a yearly basis, October CPI inched up by 0.2% over the last 12 months up from a flat reading in September. Following two months of steep declines, energy prices jumped by 0.3% in October, while food prices inched up by 0.1%.
Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, rose by 0.2% on a monthly basis in line with consensus estimates. Over the last year, Core CPI  has increased by 1.9%, unchanged from the yearly gains reported a month earlier. Also in September, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, increased by 1.3% year-over-year, unchanged from the previous month. The Core PCE Index is the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation as it weighs whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed's targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. Last week, Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer said he expects inflation to move toward its target over the next year as temporary factors from a stronger dollar and weak energy prices continue to recede.
A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to take advantage of higher yields.
