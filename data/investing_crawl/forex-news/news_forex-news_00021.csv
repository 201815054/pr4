 * German FinMin sees no definitive solution at Oct. 23 EU
summit
 * Comments dent optimism, push euro off one-month high vs
dollar
 * Cleaner euro positioning makes euro downside vulnerable

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday after the
German Finance Minister said the upcoming European Union summit
would not definitively solve the region's debt crisis, denting
investor optimism over the talks which had earlier pushed the
currency to one-month highs. 
 The euro was last down 0.7 percent against the dollar
at $1.3781 after Germany's Wolfgang Schaeuble's comments, having
risen to its highest since Sep. 15 at $1.3914 in earlier dealing
on trading platform EBS.	
 ""The optimism that's been pushing the euro higher definitely
seems to be overdone,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.	
 ""Some of the move last week was due to extreme short
positions which should now have been cleaned out to some extent
and that leaves the euro vulnerable,"" he added. 
 Traders said offers ahead of $1.3930 had halted the euro's
advance towards the pivotal $1.40 level in the near term.
Technical resistance was at $1.3937, marked by a couple of daily
highs hit in September and backed up by the 55-day moving
average around $1.3952.	
 The euro has recovered strongly since hitting a nine-month
low around $1.3145 on Oct. 4, but its recent gains have left it
vulnerable to a pullback if investors become worried EU leaders
may not be able to contain the debt crisis.	
 ""Generally investors would rather be long dollar and short
euro and would be quick to reset those positions,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.	
 Data showed speculators pared a good portion of short euro
positions in the week to Oct. 11, with the subsequent rally to
one-month highs likely to have further reduced those shorts.

 The dollar index briefly fell to a one-month low of
76.441 before recovering to 77.013, up 0.5 percent on the day.	
 The euro rallied 3.5 percent against the dollar last week
after the leaders of Germany and France pledged to unveil a new
package for solving the two-year crisis at the EU summit,
including an agreement on how to recapitalise banks.	
 ""Policymakers will announce a plan but there are questions
about whether that plan will be credible in the market's view,""
said Subbarao.	
 
 
 UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN	
 Above $1.40, the euro faces resistance around $1.4076, its
200-day moving average. It has traded below this technical
indicator since early September. 
 While attendees at the G20 summit said the pace of
discussions was encouraging, policymakers face resistance from
banks over moves to increase private sector participation in
Greek debt restructuring and to force banks to raise capital.	
 Underscoring the difficult issues to be addressed, Germany's
Schaeuble said on Sunday that Greece's debt crisis could not be
solved without larger write-downs on Greek debt. 
 Schaeuble speaks again in London later on Monday.	
 In July, private creditors agreed to a voluntary write-down
of 21 percent on their Greek debt, a figure which now looks
insufficient. Euro zone officials said last week that losses
were likely to be between 30 and 50 percent.	
 ""If recent media reports are confirmed and the amount of
haircuts does not exceed 50 percent, in our view this may fail
to appease concerns about the sustainability of the Greek debt
and thus provide no lasting support for the euro,"" Citi
strategist Valentin Marinov said in a note.	
 The euro fell from a five-week high of 107.67 yen
to trade down 0.6 percent on the day at 106.45 yen.	
 Earnings from U.S. companies including Citigroup ,
Goldman Sachs and Apple could also affect the
euro's performance, which has closely tracked investors'
appetite for stocks and other risky assets.

 LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - World stocks held near a 1-1/2
month high on Monday as expectations for solid third-quarter
earnings and hopes for a resolution to the euro zone debt crisis
supported risky assets, but gains were limited due to caution
ahead of a key EU summit.	
 Wall Street was set for a steady open later after U.S. stock
jumped on Friday following stronger-than-expected earnings from
Google . More Q3 results are due later this week.	
 But the euro fell back and German government bonds bounced
higher as caution set in, with German Finance Minister Schaeuble
saying a forthcoming EU summit would not yield a definitive
solution to the region's debt crisis. 
 G20 finance ministers and central bankers said at a meeting
in Paris that they expected euro zone leaders to ""decisively
address the current challenges through a comprehensive plan"" at
a European Union summit on Oct. 23. 
 With anticipation for a bold policy initiative running high,
investors are preferring to unwind overly pessimistic positions
although they were aware of a room for disappointment.	
 ""The question now is whether one should be fading this rally
into a potential disappointment on Oct. 23, as most investors we
speak to believe, or remain in 'buying the dips' mode. We
continue with the latter,"" JP Morgan analyst Mislav Matejka
said. 
 ""The key investor concern is regarding euro bank
deleveraging and its impact on the economy. We ... note that
only a third of bank assets are used to lend to the private
economy."" 
 The MSCI world equity index rose 0.3
percent, hitting levels not seen since late August. The index
gained 5.4 percent last week, its biggest weekly gain since July
2009, and has rebounded nearly 14 percent since hitting a
15-month low earlier this month.	
 U.S. stock futures were unchanged on the day ,
pointing to a flat open on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs ,
Bank of America and Apple Inc are all due to
report third-quarter earnings this week. 
 European stocks rose 0.8 percent while emerging
stocks gained 1.5 percent.	
 U.S. crude oil  was steady at $86.76 a barrel. It
earlier draw support from expectations that the resolution in
the euro zone debt crisis would help stem a slowdown in oil
demand growth.	
 Bund futures  erased earlier losses and rose 103
ticks.	
 The euro lost 0.8 percent to $1.3777 , having hit a
one-month high near $1.39 on Friday.	
 ""The euro will probably go above $1.40 as we go through this
week, but we could see a 'buy the rumour, sell the fact'
response next week,"" said Steve Barrow, head of G10 currency
research at Standard Bank. 
 ""My bias would be to sell into any strength, but not
aggressively"". 
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-month
high on Monday after a G20 summit boosted hopes that the EU
would decisively address the region's debt woes this week, with
traders saying additional short-covering may allow the currency
to eke out further gains. 
 The euro, down 0.2 percent at $1.3853 on light
profit-taking, rallied 3.5 percent last week after the leaders
of Germany and France pledged to unveil a new package for
solving the two-year crisis when the EU summit convenes on Oct.
23, including an agreement on how to recapitalise banks.	
 Hopes for the plan -- which also aims to make Greece's
mountain of debt more manageable and to bolster the firepower of
the euro zone's rescue fund -- helped to lift the euro off a
nine-month low around $1.3145 hit on Oct. 4 and set it
climbing to its highest in four weeks at $1.3895 on Friday.	
 ""After the developments at the latest summit, we can assume
that at long last concrete measures to solve the crisis will be
implemented next weekend,"" said Sumino Kamei, senior currency
analyst, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 ""But the euro's rally last week was caused mostly by
short-covering. It will have a hard time going above $1.40 ahead
of the EU meeting as contagion fears -- indicated by elevated
levels of European bond yields -- are still showing almost no
signs of abating,"" said Kamei.	
 Currency positioning by speculators in the week ended on
Oct. 11 also suggested traders were betting that the EU summit
would hit some snags and the euro would drop. While it may now
be closer to neutral than the data suggests, as the euro has
gained 1.6 percent since it was compiled, traders say that not
all short positions have been cleared yet. 
 ""The market is still euro-short and may get caught off guard
quite easily ... More aggressive short-covering can see the euro
go another leg higher, particularly against the yen,"" said a
trader for a Japanese bank. 


 LAYERS OF RESISTANCE	
 But any potential gains would be hard-won as the euro faces
a thick layer of resistance.	
 An option barrier and topside stop losses have been detected
at $1.3900, right above the level where the euro's rally stalled
last week. Downside stops are also seen at $1.3800.	
 If it breaches $1.3900, the euro may be halted at $1.3937,
resistance marked by a couple of daily highs hit in September,
or at its 55-day moving average near $1.3952.	
 Support for the common currency is seen around $1.3834,
roughly matching a 38.2 percent retracement of a fall from
around $1.4940 in May to a nine-month low of $1.3145 hit earlier
in October.	
 Against the yen, the euro was also 0.2 percent lower at
106.88 yen , still not far from a five-week high of
107.45 yen hit on Friday and well off a 10-year low of 100.77
yen hit in early October. 
 While attendees of the G20 summit said the pace of
discussions was encouraging, policymakers are facing stiff
resistance from banks over plans for greater private sector
participation in Greek debt restructuring and moves to force
banks to raise capital.	
 Underscoring the difficult issues that negotiations must
address, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on
Sunday that Greece's debt crisis could not be solved without
larger write-downs on Greek debt. 
 In July, private creditors agreed to a voluntary write-down
of 21 percent on their Greek debt, a figure which now looks
insufficient. Euro zone officials said last week that losses are
now likely to be between 30 and 50 percent.	
 The greenback was little changed at 77.18 yen
after hitting 77.45 on Friday, near a one-month peak set on
Wednesday.	
 The dollar index held near a one-month low of 76.508
hit on Friday after slipping 2.6 percent last week. It last
stood at 76.717.	
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and a number of
regional Fed bank presidents take to the podium this week, with
any comments about more monetary easing likely to dent the
dollar further. 
 Earnings releases from U.S. companies including Citigroup
, Goldman Sachs and Apple could also affect
the euro's performance, which has closely tracked investors'
appetite for stocks and other risky assets.	
 On Monday, the focus again turns to Europe where German
Finance Minister Schaeuble and European Central Bank Executive
Board Member Juergen Stark are giving speeches in London and
Berlin, respectively.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European stock index futures
rose 1 percent and the euro held near a 1-month high on Monday
after France and Germany said over the weekend they were making
good progress on a plan to resolve the euro zone's debt crisis
and recapitalise its banks.	
 Asian share markets also rose, helped by positive earnings
and better-than-expected retail sales data from the United
States that boosted hopes that corporate results are holding up
inspite of a gloomy global outlook.	
 But a commodities rally ran out of steam, highlighting
concerns across riskier asset classes that there is still much
work to do to avoid a meltdown in Europe's financial system.	
 ""It is too early to declare that sentiment has completely
shifted,"" said Peter Esho, chief market analyst at City Index in
Sydney. ""The market is still fragile but there is a good case
for arguing equities are cheap.""	
 G20 finance ministers and central bankers said at a meeting
in Paris that they expected euro zone leaders to ""decisively
address the current challenges through a comprehensive plan"" at
a European Union summit on Oct. 23.	
 
 French Finance Minister Francois Baroin, who chaired the
meeting, said Berlin and Paris, the leading euro zone powers,
were well on the way to agreeing on a plan to reduce Greece's
debt, stop contagion and protect Europe's banks.	
 ""The market is growing more expectant of more aggressive
measures from Europe aimed at solving its debt crisis,"" said Kim
Young-june, a market analyst at SK Securities.	
 Some market players are talking of a ""binary"" moment for the
euro zone in which the leaders' summit either comes up with the
goods to assuage concerns about the debt crisis or disappoints
markets again. 
 The former might well be taken as a reason for a sustained
rally in riskier assets such as equities and commodities. The
latter would almost certainly spark a sell-off.

 RISKIER ASSETS	
 For now, investors are looking at reasons to be hopeful. 
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  futures rose 1.1
percent. Futures for Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40
 also rose around 1 percent, and financial spreadbetters
called the FTSE 100 to make similar gains. 
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average and MSCI's
broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
both rose 1.5 percent. 
 The materials sector in the MSCI index
gained more than 2 percent, boosted by a 2.4 jump in shares of
mining giant Rio Tinto after it said it plans to sell
13 aluminium assets, trimming the business it expanded with the
badly timed $39 billion acquisition of Alcan four years ago.	
 U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with the S&P 500 up 1.7
percent, on optimism about Europe and after strong earnings from
Google Inc. , as Wall Street shares notched up their
first back-to-back weekly gains since early July. 
 The CBOE Volatility Index , also known as the Vix or
Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", fell 8 percent, an indicator that
risk appetite was returning.	
 S&P futures  advanced 0.4 percent in Asia on Monday.

 
 EURO STEADY	
 The euro held firm after posting its biggest weekly gain in
9 months last week. The single currency traded around $1.3845
, down 0.1 percent on the day but well off a 9-month
trough of $1.3144 set on Oct. 4. 
 ""After the developments at the latest summit, we can assume
that at long last concrete measures to solve the crisis will be
implemented next weekend,"" said Sumino Kamei, senior currency
analyst, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 Such measures are broadly assumed to include a plan to make
Greece's debts more manageable through bigger ""haircuts"" than
have already been agreed for private bondholders and bolstering
the firepower of the euro zone's rescue fund. 
 Much of the euro's gains, however, have been from
short-covering -- when market players buy to realise a gain on
an earlier bet against the currency -- and if EU leaders fall
short of the ""grand plan"" that markets are now expecting the
euro will quickly come under renewed pressure, traders warned.	
 Hopes of progress in Europe have also brought relief to
Asian credit markets, with spreads on the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan
investment grade index tightening further on
Monday. The index has now tightened by a dramatic 26 basis
points over the past week.	
 Growing risk appetite also reduced demand for safe-haven
government bonds, with the benchmark Japanese government bond
10-year yield rising 0.5 basis point to 1.020
percent. 
 U.S. Treasury 10-year yields rose around 1.5
basis points to about 2.265 percent, after climbing 19 basis
points last week, while the dollar firmed 0.1 percent against a
basket of currencies . 
 Commodities markets were boosted last week by data
suggesting that China, a key source of resources demand, is
containing inflation and so more likely to avoid an economic
""hard landing"".	
 Copper eased 0.4 percent to $7,514 a tonne on Monday, after
rising more than 3 percent in the previous session, and oil was
steady, with Brent crude  flat at $112.29 a barrel and
U.S. crude  up 0.3 percent at $87.09. 
 Gold, which in recent months has switched from a negative to
a positive correlation with riskier assets such as industrial
commodities and stocks as safe haven investors turned instead to
the dollar, was little changed around $1,679 an ounce, after its
biggest weekly gain since early September last week.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro
rallied on Friday over growing optimism that Europe is on track
to resolve its festering sovereign debt crisis and after data
showed a surprising surge in U.S. retail sales.
 The benchmark S&P 500 posted back-to-back weekly gains for
the first time since early July while the euro headed for its
best week in nine months against the U.S. dollar and gold
marked its biggest weekly rise in six weeks.
 Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs began
two days of talks in Paris on Friday, which investors hope will
provide a basis for a draft plan in time for a European Union
summit on Oct. 23. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L300R]
 ""Right now we are trading on hopes of a decisive policy
response,"" said Jens Nordvig, head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura
Securities in New York.
 The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.3881.
 While investors do not expect a comprehensive strategy to
Europe's debt crisis to come out of the meeting, there was
growing optimism that the meeting would put Europe on track for
a solution. In addition, data that U.S. retail sales grew by
1.1 percent in September, the fastest pace in seven months,
boosted investor sentiment on the economy's prospects.
 The data, coupled with earnings from Google  late
Thursday that trounced analysts' expectations, led investors to
shrug off a rating downgrade on Spain by Standard & Poor's and
an unexpected slump in U.S. consumer confidence in October.
 The sales data also was expected to help lift forecasts for
growth in gross domestic product even though a resolution to
Europe's debt crisis was the real focus for investors.
 ""The data hasn't mattered for a couple of months. It
matters here and there, but most of what today is, is Europe,""
said John Canally, investment strategist for LPL Financial in
Boston.
 ""Just getting the details of this plan out there and making
the details work is the most important thing,"" Canally said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The euro headed for its best
week in nine months against the dollar on Friday on optimism
that European leaders would take bold steps to tackle the debt
crisis, but a lack of concrete actions could limit further
gains.
 Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs began
a two-day meeting in Paris on Friday, a day after the euro
zone's 17 member nations completed their approval of the
expansion of the region's bailout fund. See [ID:nL5E7LE00R]
 Hopes that officials will agree on the outlines of a plan
in time for a European Union summit on Oct. 23 boosted the
euro. Discussions that China, India and other fast-growing
economies might bolster the capital base of the International
Capital Fund to help rescue Greece further lifted sentiment.
 That lifted the common currency to a one-month high just
beneath $1.39. In the near term, analysts said momentum traders
could still push the euro a bit higher, though it remained
fragile and may hit a top ahead of $1.40 in the coming days.
 ""A lot of this is a short-covering rally,"" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 Even though there's positive news from the G20 and optimism
that European policymakers would take bold actions, ""there's
still a lot of time in between when these things are announced,
when these things can be enacted, and when they can be put in
place to actually forestall further contagion,"" he said.
 The euro touched a session high of $1.3895  on
trading platform EBS. It was up 3.5 percent on the week, on
pace for its biggest weekly rise since mid-January.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
Friday that speculators reduced bets against the euro, as they
slightly boosted long positions in the U.S. dollar. [IMM/FX]
 Talk that the European Central Bank was buying Italian and
Spanish debt also helped lift the single currency off an
earlier low of $1.3723.

 SPAIN DOWNGRADE
 Standard & Poor's cut Spain's credit rating, underlining
the challenges facing euro zone officials to contain the debt
crisis. Fitch put a number of European banks on review for
possible downgrades.
 Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos pledged to pass
sweeping austerity measures in parliament next week, declaring
that Greece was in a ""fight for our existence.""
 Inspectors from the European Union, International Monetary
Fund and European Central Bank said they would recommend
releasing an 8 billion euro tranche of aid that Greece needs to
keep paying its bills past mid-November. But they warned that
the country was slipping behind on its targets.
 Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said
for now, hopes that Greece will receive loans and steps to
expand the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) have
calmed market jitters.
 But he added: ""an actual plan will be tougher to deliver,
and the Greek issue will return as that country inevitably
fails to meets its new targets. A default on Greek debt still
leaves risk that investors will refuse to fund Spain or Italy,
countries that the current EFSF isn't large enough to bail
out.""
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.5 percent to 77.22
, after hitting 77.45 on EBS, near a one-month high
set on Wednesday. On the week, the dollar gained 0.6 percent.
 An increase in risk appetite hurt the safe-haven dollar,
which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies
<.DXY>. The dollar index was on track for a weekly loss of 2.6
percent, the biggest since May 2009.
 Earnings releases next week from U.S. companies, including
Citigroup , Goldman Sachs  and Apple  could
also affect the euro's performance, which has closely tracked
investors' appetite for stocks and other risky assets.

 NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Global stocks gained and the
euro strengthened on Friday on news of surging U.S. retail
sales, strong earnings at Google, and optimism that Europe is
on track to resolve its debilitating sovereign debt crisis.
 U.S. retail sales grew in September at their fastest in
seven months, while data for August was revised upward in a
report that buoyed investors' sentiment and is expected to lift
economic growth forecasts.
 The U.S. data, coupled with earnings from Google 
late Thursday that trounced analysts' expectations, led
investors to shrug off Standard & Poor's credit-rating
downgrade of Spain and an unexpected slump in consumer
confidence in October.
 ""It's a very promising report,"" said Cary Leahey, senior
economist at Decision Economics in New York, referring to the
U.S. retail sales data. ""I would not be surprised if the
typical forecaster doesn't add a 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point to
their third-quarter GDP growth rate.""
 Wall Street stocks jumped 1.0 percent or more at the
opening, following similar gains in Europe. The euro rose 0.8
percent to $1.3876.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 107.25
points, or 0.93 percent, at 11,585.38. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 15.70 points, or 1.30 percent, at
1,219.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 36.13
points, or 1.38 percent, at 2,656.37.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
regional shares rose 0.9 percent while MSCI's all-country world
equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 1.5 percent.
 An appetite for risk swept markets, lifting the price of
crude oil more than 2.0 percent and pushing down the U.S.
dollar and government debt which usually benefit when news is
bearish.
 ""The outlook is good and getter better by the day. Risk is
back on,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.
 Brent crude  rose above $114 a barrel, propelled by

 The finance chiefs and heads of central banks from the G-20
countries are meeting in Paris on Friday to thrash out a
resolution to the crisis in time for a European Union summit on
Oct. 23. [ID:nL5E7LE00R]
 Early hints that China may loosen credit as inflation cools
also spurred optimism as investors mostly ignored a preliminary
reading of consumer sentiment that sagged to 57.5 from 59.4 in
September, a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey
showed.
 November Brent crude  rose $3.01 to $114.12 a barrel
on the day of its expiry, while U.S. crude  was up $2.70
at $86.92 a barrel.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 21/32 in price to yield 2.26 percent.

 By Nia Williams	
 LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The euro gained on Friday,
supported by cautious optimism European leaders are closer to
agreeing a plan to tackle the euro zone debt crisis, and was on
track for its biggest weekly gain since January thanks to a
short-covering rally.	
 Traders said the European Central Bank was seen buying
Italian and Spanish government debt, helping the euro
reach a session high of $1.3828, though analysts saw limited
room for more gains. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.3785.	
 On the downside, bids were seen around $1.3720-25, with
stops at $1.3705 and larger demand around $1.3680-90. Traders
also cited a large options expiry at $1.3800 for 1400 GMT.	
 Group of 20 finance chiefs and central bank heads meet in
Paris on Friday and Saturday. Although investors were not
expecting any concrete resolutions to the debt crisis to come
out of the meeting, they hoped it would provide an opportunity
for officials to agree on the outlines of a plan in time for a
European Union summit on Oct. 23. 
 This enabled the shared currency to recover from a session
low of $1.3723, hit after rating agency S&P downgraded Spain's
credit rating to AA-minus, mirroring last week's Fitch
downgrade. 
 ""Hope has been the driver all week and going into the G20
meeting people are looking for more clarification on what we
might get,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of currency
research in Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.	
 On the week, the euro was up nearly 3 percent, a gain that
would mark the strongest weekly performance since mid-January if
it is maintained through Friday.	
 Analysts also said talk of possible International Monetary
Fund support for Europe was helping the euro. A G20 source told
Reuters on Thursday the IMF would present a plan to its board to
make short-term credit lines available to fundamentally healthy
countries hit by liquidity crises. 
 Such a move would also spark flows out of dollars into
euros, boosting the single currency, analysts said, but they
were wary of the administrative and political hurdles to be
overcome before such a plan could become reality.	
 Expectations from the EU summit, preceding a G20 meeting on
Nov. 3, are particularly high after French and German leaders
pledged to unveil a new package for solving the debt crisis by
the end of the month, including an agreement on how to
recapitalise banks. 
 
 EURO FACES RESISTANCE	
 The euro has recovered strongly from an 8-1/2 month trough
of $1.3144 hit on Oct. 4, buoyed by a short-covering rally as
investors pared bearish bets. Although it may claw above $1.39
by the end of the month, it looks poised to take a breather
after its recent rally, market players said.	
 ""Two weeks ago the market was pitch black and there was a
lot of negative new momentum. Now it is slightly more neutral
but it doesn't mean anything fundamental has changed,"" said Hans
Redeker, head of global FX strategy at Morgan Stanley.	
 ""The euro is pretty much at the upper end of its trading
range,"" he said, adding that Morgan Stanley were sticking to
their forecast that the euro will fall to $1.30 by year-end.	
 Resistance was seen at this week's one-month peak of $1.3834
on trading platform EBS, with more at $1.3937, a couple of daily
highs in September, as well as the 55-day moving average near
$1.3957.	
 ""Levels around $1.30-1.33 would be more fundamentally
justified but it's hard to tell when market sentiment will
turn,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency analyst at Commerzbank.	
 The euro rose 0.3 percent versus the Japanese yen
to 106.19, and was steady against the Swiss franc at 1.2375
francs .	
 The growth-linked and higher-yielding Australian
dollar was up 0.5 percent at US$1.0240 , after hitting a
three-week high of $1.0261.	
 The U.S. dollar rose 0.3 percent versus the yen to 77.07
, near this week's one-month high around 77.48 yen.

 By Dominic Lau	
 LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - European shares and the euro rose
on Friday, boosted by hopes of progress towards a solution to
the euro zone's debt crisis later this month, shrugging off a
credit rating downgrade for Spain.	
 Tamer inflation figures from top metal consumer China lifted
some worries over Chinese demand, boosting metal prices as well
as Europe-listed mining shares and adding further upward
momentum to the broader equity markets. 
 G20 finance chiefs and central banks heads from the world's
biggest economies meet in Paris on Friday in search for a
solution to a deepening crisis that has fanned fears of a global
recession.	
 Financial markets have been more buoyant since a pledge by
French and German leaders to come up with a comprehensive plan
for ending two years of turmoil, including a programme to
recapitalise banks, by an Oct. 23 summit.	
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3784 and on track
for its best weekly gain in nine months. The common currency
dipped overnight on the move by Standard and Poor's to cut Spain
by one notch AA-minus, although that only brought its rating
into line with rival agency Fitch .	
 ""We see a lot of optimism in the market, there are a lot of
promises to develop a global, sustainable solution to the
European debt crisis. We saw overnight when Spain was
downgraded, there was no lasting impact on euro/dollar,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency analyst at Commerzbank.	
 U.S. stock index futures    rose about 0.7
percent, indicating a firm start for Wall Street. 
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 advanced 0.7 percent,
though Spain's benchmark underperformed, down 0.2
percent.	
 Yields on 10-year benchmark Spanish government bonds
rose 8.4 basis points to 5.3 percent and the cost
of insuring its debt against default rose 10 bps to 389 bps.	
 The premium for investors to hold French 10-year government
bonds over equivalent German Bunds
hit a euro-era high on worries over France's credit rating after
Fitch put a series of banks on review for downgrade. 
 Fitch cut the credit rating of UBS and said it may
downgrade seven other U.S. and European banks because of
challenges in the economy and financial markets, which included
Deutsche Bank , BNP Paribas and Societe
Generale .

 
 BANKS	
 European bank shares underperformed the broader
market, down 0.7 percent.	
 Credit Suisse analysts said European policymakers' plan to
shore up confidence in banks needed to be undertaken quickly.	
 ""If those stresses are not relieved soon, it's likely that
credit conditions for firms will tighten severely, raising the
prospect of a deep euro area recession,"" they said in a note.	
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
added 0.2 percent. The index is up 4.3 percent
this week, heading for its best weekly gain in more than three
months though it is still down 9.9 percent this year.	
 Asian shares outside of Japan slipped 0.2
percent and Japan's Nikkei average lost 0.9 percent.	
 Copper rose 3 percent as the Chinese inflation data
lend support to views that Beijing will keep interest rates on
hold, sustaining demand from the giant Asian economy.	
 Brent crude  added 1.4 percent to trade above $112 a
barrel and was set for its best weekly rise since early July.	
 Gold was also in demand, up 0.6 percent and heading
for its biggest weekly gain in more than a month.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Friday but
hovered above an intraday low hit after S&P cut Spain's credit
rating, and was on track for its biggest weekly rally since
January after getting lifted by a flurry of short-covering. 
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3770 , having
trimmed its losses after dipping to as low as $1.3723 following
S&P's downgrade of Spain's credit rating to AA-minus. The move
mirrored last week's downgrade of Spain by Fitch.

 S&P's downgrade of Spain came shortly after Fitch on
Thursday cut the ratings of UBS AG and placed several other
European banks on credit watch negative. 
 The euro, however, was still up 2.8 percent this week, a
gain that if maintained through Friday would mark the strongest
weekly performance since mid-January. 
 ""The euro has had a pretty good run in the past week. It
started to run into key resistance levels and markets are
building a fair amount of expectations around the Oct. 23
(EU)Summit,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS.	
 A Group of 20 preparatory meeting on Friday and Saturday is
not expected to announce market-moving statements.
The EU Summit will be on Oct. 23-24, ahead of a
G20 meeting on Nov. 3.	
 Gibbs said he did not see the flurry of ratings actions as
having a lasting negative impact on the euro.	
 ""This is not a new story,"" he said.	
 The euro and risky assets such as equities have
bounced this week as investors pared their overly bearish bets.	
 The short-covering rally came after the leaders of Germany
and France pledged to unveil a new comprehensive package for
solving the euro zone's debt crisis by the end of the month,
including an agreement on how to recapitalise banks. 
 
 EURO FACES RESISTANCE	
 Euro resistance is seen at this week's one-month peak of
$1.3834 on trading platform EBS, a level that roughly matches a
38.2 percent retracement of a fall from around $1.4940 in May to
a nine-month low of $1.3145 hit last week.	
 More resistance lies at $1.3937, a couple of daily highs hit
in September, as well as near $1.3957, the euro's 55-day moving
average.	
 Support on hourly charts lies roughly in the $1.3700 to
$1.3690 area.	
 While the euro may claw above $1.39 by the end of
the month, overall, the single currency seems poised to take a
breather after its recent rally, said a trader for a major
Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 ""My sense is that the euro is now at pretty high levels
within a range, and that it will eventually test the downside
again,"" the trader said. The single currency is likely to trade
in a range of about $1.3950 to $1.3450 until the end of October,
he added. 
 One question hanging over the euro is what would happen if
euro zone banks were to need taxpayer funds to bolster their
capital, the trader said.	
 ""You have to wonder whether the individual countries will be
able to take care of such funding, since that would lead to an
increase in fiscal deficits,"" he said. 
 EU officials said on Thursday that weak European banks may
get up to six months to bolster their balance sheets after a
fresh round of stricter stress tests forces them to face up to a
fall in the value of sovereign bonds.	
 This timeline will ultimately need the approval of
governments, many of whom are nervous that the bill for helping
banks will again land with them. 
 The Australian dollar held steady at $1.0188
, having climbed 4.3 percent this week, on track for its
biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2010. 
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 76.89 ,
having backed down from a one-month high around 77.48 yen struck
this week.

 By Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - European stock futures rose on
Friday, shrugging off weakness in Asian equity markets on
concerns about sluggish global growth, while another sovereign
debt ratings downgrade briefly pushed the euro lower.	
 Lingering concerns about Europe's debt woes and the latest
credit rating cut of Spain by Standard & Poor's underpinned the
safety of government bonds, slightly boosting the price of U.S.
Treasuries in Asia.	
 European futures  rose as much as 1 percent as
encouraging results from Google supported tech stocks,
while miners were likely to track higher metals prices.	
 The mood was more bearish in Asia, however, after
weaker-than-expected China trade data on Thursday raised
questions about global growth.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
eased 0.4 percent, but was set for a weekly gain
of 5 percent, which would be the largest weekly rise since
November last year, when it ended the week up 5.2 percent.	
 The index has lost around 16 percent in the year to date
after heavy declines in August and September, but has clawed
back some ground of late on hopes of decisive action from
European leaders soon to stem the region's festering debt
crisis.	
 Materials led the index lower as concerns grew about
weakening demand from China, but oil and copper recovered
earlier losses, partly on technical rebound.	
 ""Concerns about China's demand and doubts over Europe's
ability to contain the crisis are somewhat overblown,"" said
Tetsu Emori, a fund manager at Astmax Co Ltd in Tokyo.	
 China's growth may moderate but it will still be high, with
domestic demand staying solid over the medium-term even if the
pace of growth slowed, while Europe has no choice but stand by
Greece, he said.	
 ""Investors have undergone adjustments since the spring,
reducing excessive positions, and I feel the markets currently
stand at a juncture where players want to confirm the floor and
survive the month,"" he said.	
 China's consumer price index rose 6.1 percent in September
from a year earlier, a touch easier than August and lending
support to views the central bank will keep interest rates on
hold. 
 Most analysts still expect China to grow at least 9 percent
this year.	
 The Nikkei average fell 0.9 percent after hitting a
four-week high on Thursday, with shares of camera maker Olympus
plunging nearly 18 percent after it fired its CEO.	
 
 Hong Kong and Shanghai shares also fell as traders took
profits from a rally in banks and property sectors this week,
but the benchmarks Hang Seng index and the Shanghai
Composite Index were set for weekly gains of 4.5 percent
and 2.2 percent, respectively.	
 China's sovereign wealth fund stepped in to shore up banking
shares this week.	
 ""The gains this past week are the most significant movement
since 2009 and likely herald a positive shift,"" said Zhong Hua,
senior equity analyst at Guotai Junan Securities at an investor
conference in Shanghai.	
 
 EUROPE STILL EYED	
 Oil prices recovered after falling on worries about slower
demand in China, the world's second-largest oil consumer. Brent
crude  edged up 0.1 percent to $111.26 a barrel and U.S.
November crude  rose 0.4 percent to $84.54. 
 The most active December copper contract on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange  rose 1.2 percent. Gold, a favourite
safe-haven asset, traded flat on Friday, showing muted reaction
to the Spain's credit rating downgrade. 
 ""The bar is very high for Europe credit news to be
considered 'bad' beyond what is priced in,"" said a
Singapore-based trader. ""My sense is that a lot of premium has
been spent and cash hoarded insuring against the worst-case
scenario.""	
 Europe is showing signs of accelerating efforts to shore up
the euro zone banking sector and limit the damage from the
region's spreading sovereign debt crisis, but the cost it would
have to pay could pose risks to the single currency and growth.	
 The region's financial turmoil took a toll on bank earnings,
as reduced demand for securities underwriting and acquisition
advice eroded earnings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the
second largest U.S. lender the first major bank to post third
quarter results. 
 The euro dipped after the S&P downgrade of Spain but
pared losses to stand little changed at around 1.3802 by
mid-afternoon in Asia, keeping it on track for its biggest
weekly rally since January. 
 The European Central Bank said on Thursday that forcing
private bondholders to accept losses on euro zone sovereign debt
could damage the reputation of the euro, hurt the bloc's banks
and encourage volatility on foreign exchange markets. 
 The ECB's warnings made no specific reference to the debate
on increasing previously agreed plans for a 21 percent writedown
for banks holding Greek debt. 
 In its October monthly bulletin, the ECB said downside risks
relate especially to financial market turmoil. 
 
 ASIA CREDIT WEAKENS	
 In Asian credit markets, which have reflected the strain of
waning confidence in the financial system, spreads on the iTraxx
Asia ex-Japan investment grade index widened again
by about 10 points early on Friday, after narrowing sharply the
day before by about 17 points.	
 As investors sought relative safety, prices of U.S. Treasury
note steadied after inching up earlier on Friday. The benchmark
10-year note yielded 2.1852 percent, compared to 2.1798 percent
late in New York on Thursday. 
 The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds inched up
but gains were limited.	
 ""European officials may still be behind the curve, but with
recent steps, the gap between market perception of them doing
too little, too late and their actual action is narrowing,"" said
Shinji Nomura, chief fixed-income strategist at SMBC Nikko
Securities.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell and oil and
copper declined on Thursday after soft Chinese data drove
worries about the strength of world economy.
 The euro slipped against the dollar a day after hitting an
almost one-month high. European Central Bank policy makers
warned the euro zone could fall back into recession.
 The ECB also warned that forcing private bondholders to
accept losses on euro zone sovereign debt could damage the euro
and hurt banks. For details see [ID:nL5E7LD0QX]
[ID:nF9E7GA02A].
 An index of U.S. bank shares <.BKX> slid 2.9 percent and an
index of European lenders <.SX7P> lost 3.7 percent.
 Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the second largest U.S.
bank, slid 4.8 percent to $31.60. after it reported a drop in
quarterly earnings. JPMorgan was the first major U.S. bank to
post results this season. [ID:nN1E7951DK]
 Prices of U.S. Treasury debt rose as investors sought
relative safety. Major stock markets and the euro had recently
jumped sharply on hopes the debt crisis was close to being
resolved.
 ""Over the last week we have seen a major short squeeze in a
number of risk-sensitive assets,"" said Jens Nordvig, head of
G10 currency strategy at Nomura in New York.
 ""But the fundamental picture remains clearly negative,"" he
said. ""We remain very skeptical that European policy makers
will bring out a convincing policy response in coming weeks.""
 U.S. shares fell from three-week highs after China reported
its trade surplus narrowed for a second straight month in
September. Both imports and exports were lower than expected.
For details, see [ID:nL3E7LD0GV]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 40.72 points,
or 0.35 percent, to 11,478.13. The S&P Poor's 500 <.SPX> dipped
3.59 points, or 0.30 percent, to 1,203.66. The Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> gained 15.51 points, or 0.60 percent, to 2,620.24.
 A spike in shares of chip makers helped drive the
tech-heavy Nasdaq higher.
 The S&P 500 has run up more than 10 percent from a 2011 low
hit on Oct. 4; on Wednesday it notched the largest seven-day
rally since March 2009 on growing optimism European leaders
were making progress in tackling the region's debt problems.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.2 percent after six days of gains.
 Crude oil imports into China, one of the largest engines of
demand growth, dropped 12 percent in September from last year's
record high. Brent  crude fell 0.2 percent on the day,
snapping a six-day winning streak. U.S. light crude futures
 dropped 1.2 percent, further hurt by a rise in
stockpiles.
 The soft data from China also pressured copper prices
. The industrial metal, often taken as a proxy for
economic growth expectations, fell 2.5 percent. China is the
world's largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 40
percent of global demand.
 The euro slipped against the U.S. dollar, pulling back from
a one-month high, after the ECB warned about the impact on the
currency and the region's banks of involving bondholders in
euro zone bailouts.
 Slovakia's parliament backed a plan to bolster the euro
zone's rescue fund after political parties agreed to hold an

 But even with a revamped rescue fund, European banks remain
vulnerable to a Greek default and to sovereign downgrades. That
increases the urgency for them to raise more capital to remain
financially sound, analysts said.
 The single currency  hit a New York session low of
$1.3685 on trading platform EBS. It last traded at $1.3786,
down less than 0.1 percent on the day. The euro on Wednesday
touched its highest level versus the greenback since Sept. 16.
 Italy sold 6.2 billion euros of debt, split across four
bonds. But yields remained under pressure, and the European
Central Bank stepped into the secondary market after the
auction, buying Italian debt to cap rising yields.

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 9/32, with
the yield at 2.1798 percent.
 Thirty-year bonds  gained as much as two points
after a $30 billion auction that saw yields fall below market
forecasts. They last traded up 30/32 in price to yield 3.149
percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday a day after hitting an almost one-month
high, as investors refocused on worries about European banks
and a deteriorating growth outlook for the euro zone.
 Disappointing trade data from China further weighed on risk
appetite and pressured the euro. The common currency's recent
move has correlated closely with investor demand for stocks and
other risky assets.
 European Central Bank policy makers warned on Thursday that
the euro zone could fall back into recession. The ECB also
warned that forcing private bondholders to accept losses on
euro zone sovereign debt could damage the euro and hurt banks.
For details see [ID:nL5E7LD0QX] [ID:nF9E7GA02A].
 Thursday's pause suggested investors are cautious about
pushing the euro higher given the barriers policy makers face
to finding a lasting solution to the bloc's spreading debt
crisis.
 ""Over the last week we have seen a major short squeeze in a
number of risk-sensitive assets, including in euro/dollar. But
the fundamental picture remains clearly negative,"" said Jens
Nordvig, head of G10 currency strategy at Nomura in New York.
 ""We remain very skeptical that European policy makers will
bring out a convincing policy response in coming weeks.""
 The euro  last traded slightly down at $1.3786,
retreating from a high of $1.3834 set on trading platform EBS
on Wednesday, the strongest level since mid-September.
 It pared some losses after Slovakia's parliament backed a
plan to bolster the euro zone's rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability fund, concluding the ratification process
in all 17 euro-zone countries.
 Despite Thursday's pullback, the euro was up 2.9 percent so
far this week, a gain that if maintained through Friday would
mark the strongest weekly performance since mid-January.
 Analysts cautioned that even with a strengthened EFSF,
European banks are still vulnerable to a Greek default and
further sovereign downgrades.
 European Union officials said on Thursday that weak banks
may get up to six months to bolster their balance sheets after
a rapid health check currently under way. [ID:nB5E7L5016]

 Against the yen, the euro slipped 0.5 percent to 105.99
yen, retreating from a one-month high at 107.035 yen
 recorded on EBS on Wednesday.
 Investors awaited this weekend's meeting of the Group of 20
rich and emerging nations that could result in more assurances
for investors after leaders from Germany and France pledged to
announce a plan to solve the debt crisis by the end of the
month.
 ""This weekend could be a turning point for the beleaguered
common currency,"" said Brendan McGrath, senior analyst at
Western Union Business Solutions in Victoria, British
Columbia.
 ""Market participants are looking for something concrete
that will ease their fears and allow capital to flow freely
once again,"" he said. ""If something positive and constructive
results from the summit this weekend, it could give the euro a
big boost.""
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.5 percent to 76.84
, pulling back from a one-month high around 77.489 yen
reached on EBS on Wednesday.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Global stocks and copper
prices fell from recent highs on Thursday after weak data from
China reinforced concerns about the global economy, while the
euro dipped on lagging worries over the European debt crisis.
 The European Central Bank warned about the effect of
bondholder write-downs, and investor unease on the
effectiveness of current measures to prevent the spread of the
euro zone debt crisis could be seen in the rise in yields on
Italian bonds.
 Major stock markets had recently jumped sharply on hopes
the debt crisis was close to being resolved.
 Prices of U.S. Treasury debt rose as investors sought
relative safety.
 On Wall Street, shares of JPMorgan Chase slumped 5.5
percent to $31.39 after the bank reported a drop in quarterly
earnings. It was the first major U.S. bank to post results this
season.
 U.S. shares fell from three-week highs after China reported
its trade surplus narrowed for a second straight month in
September. Both imports and exports were lower than expected.
For details, see [ID:nL3E7LD0GV]
 The data reflected global economic weakness, which along
with the euro zone debt crisis, drove equities and commodities
to post heavy losses in the third quarter.
 An index of U.S. bank shares <.BKX> slid 4.3 percent.

 ""JPMorgan is a good indicator of what is happening in the
banking industry and a little bit of an insight into where
consumer banking is headed."" said Kim Forrest, senior equity
research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
 In afternoon trading in New York, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> dropped 51.50 points, or 0.45 percent, to
11,467.35. The S&P 500 <.SPX> dropped 6.80 points, or 0.56
percent, to 1,200.45. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> gained 4.05
points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,608.78.
 A spike in shares of chipmakers kept the tech-heavy Nasdaq
higher.
 The S&P 500 has run up more than 10 percent from a 2011 low
hit on Oct. 4 and had notched its largest seven-day rally since
March 2009 on growing optimism European leaders were making
progress in tackling the region's debt problems.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.5 percent after six days of gains.
 The soft data from China also pressured copper prices
. The industrial metal, often taken as a proxy for
economic growth expectations, fell 2.5 percent. China is the
world's largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 40
percent of global demand.
 The euro pared losses but was still trading lower against
the U.S. dollar, pulling back from a one-month high, after the
ECB warned about the impact on the currency and the region's
banks of involving bondholders in euro zone bailouts.
 Slovakia's parliament backed a plan to bolster the euro
zone's rescue fund after political parties agreed to hold an

 But even with a revamped rescue fund, European banks are
still vulnerable to a Greek default and to sovereign
downgrades. That increases the urgency for them to raise more
capital to remain financially sound, analysts said.
 ""After such a strong rally this week based on nothing but
hope, people realize that things are not going to come as
easily as they had hoped,"" said Kathy Lien, director of

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The euro declined on Thursday
after the European Central Bank warned any write-down on
government debt that causes bondholder losses could damage the
currency and the region's banking system.
 The euro's retreat from its near one-month highs against
the dollar and yen was compounded by disappointing trade data
from China and fading demand to cover short positions, analysts
and traders said.
 ""These gains are unlikely pretty short-lived until we get
more clarity from Europe,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX
strategist with TD Securities in Toronto.
 The euro , despite Thursday's pullback, is up roughly
3 percent against the U.S. dollar from its 8-1/2 month low set
last week. It was last down 0.38 percent at $1.3732 after
touching $1.3834 on the EBS trading platform.
 The euro  fell almost 1 percent to 105.47 yen,
sagging from near one-month high at 107.03 yen recorded on
Wednesday.
 The ECB warned that any sovereign debt write-offs that
force losses could damage the euro's reputation, but the bank
made no specific reference to the current debate on increasing
previously agreed plans for a 21 percent write-down for banks.
[ID:nF9E7GA02A]
 This weekend's meeting of the Group of 20 rich and emerging
nations in Paris could result in more assurance for investors
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy late last week said they would announce a plan
to solve the euro zone debt crisis by the end of the month.
 Their statement had prompted investors to pare back bets
for more euro losses, but Thursday's selling suggested
investors are cautious about pushing the euro higher given the
barriers policy-makers face to finding a lasting solution.
 ""We've come a long way in a fairly short period time, so
we're seeing a squeeze to the downside. All the structural
negatives for the euro are still there,"" said Geoff Kendrick,
currency strategist at Nomura in London.

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Thursday, pulling back from a one-month high versus the dollar
after the European Central Bank warned about the impact on the
currency and the region's banks of involving private sector
bondholders in euro zone bailouts.	
 The euro hit a session low of $1.3708 after an
article in the ECB's monthly report said forcing private
bondholders to accept losses on euro zone sovereign debt could
damage the common currency's reputation, prompting traders to
take profits on the previous day's short-covering rally.

 The euro hit a one-month high of $1.3834 on Wednesday as
investors pared back heavily short positions on cautious
optimism that a solution to the euro zone's debt crisis could be
close. A Franco/German statement on Sunday said a plan to solve
the crisis would be unveiled by the end of the month.	
 Thursday's selling suggested investors are still reluctant
to buy the euro given the barriers policymakers face to finding
a lasting debt solution.	
 ""We've come a long way in a fairly short period time, so
we're seeing a squeeze to the downside. All the structural
negatives for the euro are still there,"" said Geoff Kendrick,
currency strategist at Nomura.	
 He added that the euro's downside remained intact, adding:
""I'd be a seller if we rise above $1.40. I wouldn't be surprised
to see $1.33 before we get a Greek bailout."" 
 Traders said selling by Russian names and European
corporates dragged the euro down from a session high of $1.3827
touched in early European trade. Bids were reported on approach
to $1.3700 with stop-losses below there and on a break of
$1.3670. It was last down 0.4 percent on the day at $1.3735. 
 The sell-off highlighted wariness among investors about
betting on more gains unless euro zone authorities unveil a
convincing strategy to fight the crisis at a summit on Oct. 23.	
 ""Unless we really break through the $1.37-1.38 area, it
might be tough to build euro long positions up here,"" said
Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at CIBC.	
 He said the summit was key to whether the euro would extend
its gains. Investors will need to be convinced that officials
have a unified, lasting solution to help debt-ridden countries
including Greece, while limiting the impact elsewhere. 
 ""We need to see recognition that France and Germany are on
the same page, and the recognition that officials are looking
for a pan-European solution, rather than national ones. Also,
the rescue fund has to be large enough to be able to cope with
the scale of the problem,"" Stretch said.	
 Other analysts said the euro was vulnerable to more selling
if investors believe officials are doing too little, too late to
bolster European banks, which are expected suffer if they are
forced to accept haircuts on their Greek debt holdings.	
 The euro fell 1 percent to 105.36 yen, retreating
sharply from a one-month high near 107.03 yen hit the previous
day, before settling around 105.50. 
 
 EURO RESISTANCE 
 The euro was still up around 2.5 percent versus the dollar
this week, but technical analysts said its upside was limited
after it stopped ahead of resistance around $1.3848, the 50
percent retracement of its late August to early October slide.	
 Above that, further resistance lies at $1.3937, which
corresponds to a couple of daily highs hit in September.	
 Selling in the euro helped the dollar index to rise
0.3 percent to 77.212, recovering from a near one-month low of
76.796 hit the previous day. 
 The Australian dollar was flat at US$1.0132, below
a three-week high of $1.0235 hit after data showed Australian
employment rose by a surprisingly strong 20,400 in September,
the biggest increase in seven months.

 Despite its gains versus the euro and other currencies, the
dollar fell 0.5 percent to 76.86 yen as the Japanese currency
gained across the board. The dollar had hit a one-month high
around 77.48 yen on Wednesday.	
 Traders said yen buying by Japanese exporters weighed on
dollar/yen and cross/yen, together with a sell-off in European
equity markets.

 LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Italy's sale of 6.2 billion euros
in bonds on Thursday eased investors' immediate concerns about
its funding in the euro zone debt crisis, but stock markets were
hit by weaker Chinese trade data.	
 European shares fell 0.9 percent after recent gains and Wall
Street looked set to open lower following data showing China's
trade surplus narrowed for a second straight month in September,
with both imports and exports lower than expected.	
 It reflected global economic weakness, which along with the
euro zone debt crisis has kept investors avoiding aggressive
risk taking over the past months.	
 In Europe, there appeared some traction to the idea that
policymakers were working on a cogent plan to solve the debt
crisis, or at least reduce its threat.	
 Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission,
outlined a broad plan on Wednesday to tackle the euro zone's
two-year debt crisis, fuelling optimism.	
 ""Maybe the political decisions are finally coming through,""
said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven Investment
Management.	
 The sale of Italian bonds went relatively smoothly, although
a lot of the buying may have been prompted by cheaper prices
ahead of the sale.	
 Traders said the European Central Bank began buying Italian
bonds focused around the 10-year sector shortly after the
release of auction results. 
 Earlier 10-year yields rose to 5.87 percent, their highest
since the central bank began purchasing Italian debt in August
as part of an effort to cap the country's rising cost of
borrowing. The 10-year yield was last at 5.80 percent, 6 basis
points higher on the day.	
 
 STOCKS MIXED	
 On stock markets, the FTSEurofirst 300 fell but was
still heading for its third straight week of gains, something it
has not achieved since March/April.	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were down a
bit.	
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei rose nearly 1 percent,
catching up with U.S. and European gains from Wednesday. 
 The euro fell broadly, pulling back from a one-month high
versus the dollar after the European Central Bank warned about
the impact on the currency and the region's banks of involving
bondholders in euro zone bailouts. 
The euro hit a session low of $1.3711 after an article in the
ECB's monthly report said forcing private bondholders to accept
losses on euro zone sovereign debt could damage the euro's
reputation, prompting traders to take profits on a rally which
has been built on investors backing off bets for further euro
weakness rather than betting on future gains. 
The euro had rallied earlier in the week, climbing to $1.3834
on Wednesday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy late last week said they would
announce a plan to solve the euro zone debt crisis by the end of
the month.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on
Thursday, hovering near a one-month high hit the previous day,
with traders saying the single currency could eke out more gains
in the near-term on short-covering, even if a sustained rally
seems unlikely. 
 The Australian dollar hit a three-week high as strong jobs
data prompted investors to scale back expectations for a cut in
interest rates in the near term, but the currency's rise stalled
right at resistance in the $1.0235 to $1.0239 area.	
 The yen inched higher as Japanese exporters sold dollars and
cross/yen after the dollar and the euro both touched one-month
peaks against the yen the previous day.	
 Market players said the euro and risky assets may have a
little more room to rise due to the potential for further
short-covering by investors that had taken very bearish
positions, but were sceptical that there would be a sustained
rally.	
 ""I don't think all the trouble is over, but I think the
market has been running short euro/dollar and we're seeing a
clear-out,"" said Jesper Bargmann, Asia head of G11 spot FX for
RBS in Singapore. 
 ""There could be another 100 pips to the topside, but I
am starting to look for levels to sell euro/dollar again. I
think that negative news will have more effect now when people
have cleared out their short positions,"" he said. 
 Overall, the euro will probably be stuck in range until
a G20 summit in early November, Bargmann said, adding that the
top of that range was likely to be near the euro's current
levels. 
 The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3799 . The
single currency had touched a one-month high of $1.3834 on
Wednesday on trading platform EBS, its rise having gained steam
after breaching an option barrier at $1.3700 and triggering
stop-loss bids.	
 Traders said the euro may have further room to
rise ahead of a major EU summit on Oct. 23, where hopes are
mounting that euro zone authorities will unveil a comprehensive
strategy to fight the region's debt crisis.	
 ""I want to give this risk-on move a bit more time. But we
have a history of Europe giving us far too little, far too
late,"" warned Robert Rennie, chief currency strategist at
Westpac Bank in Sydney.	
 ""So I'm very conscious of the fact that coming to the G20
finance meeting this weekend and the leaders summit the
following weekend, I want to start selling the euro, the Aussie
and risk again.""	
 Traders said there was some light selling of
euro/dollar and euro/yen by Asian real money investors on
Thursday. 
 
 AUSSIE FACES RESISTANCE 
 The euro now faces resistance at around $1.3848, the 50
percent retracement of its late August to early October slide.
Above that further resistance lies at $1.3937, which corresponds
to a couple of daily highs hit in September. 
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent against the yen to 106.39
, having pulled back from a one-month high near 107.03
yen hit the previous day. 
 The Japanese currency also edged higher against the
dollar, which fell 0.2 percent to 77.10 yen . The dollar
had hit a one-month high around 77.48 yen on Wednesday. 
 Yen-buying by Japanese exporters weighed on dollar/yen and
cross/yen, traders said.	
 With the start of a new fiscal half-year in Japan this
month, there is focus on the investment stance of Japanese
investors. Japan's Fukoku Life Insurance told Reuters on
Thursday that it will reduce its net purchases of foreign bonds
in the half-year to March from its original plan.

 The Australian dollar jumped after data showed
Australian employment rose by a surprisingly strong 20,400 in
September, the biggest increase in seven months.

 The Australian dollar rose 0.5 percent to $1.0195
, having touched a three-week high of $1.0235 at
one point.	
 The Aussie dollar's rise stalled near a couple of
retracement levels. The 50 percent retracement of the Aussie
dollar's late July to early October fall comes in at $1.0235,
and the 61.8 percent retracement of its September to October
drops lies at $1.0239.	
 The Australian dollar took in its stride data showing
that China's trade surplus narrowed for a second straight month
in September. The Aussie dollar can be
sensitive to shifts in China's economic fundamentals since China
is a major buyer of Australia's commodity exports.

 By Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Thursday on
growing optimism that Europe will take concrete steps to contain
the region's debt woes and head off a systemic banking crisis,
but European equities were seen weaker as credit problems
fuelled growth concerns.	
 Strengthening investor confidence in the euro zone
underpinned the single currency, while receding concerns about
the banks' problems threatening the wider financial system
sharply tightened Asian credit markets.	
 ""Markets are feeling better. The sense is that things are
beginning to be put in place, bondholder haircuts, bank
recapitalisations and the EFSF l,,lexpansion,"" said a
Singapore-based trader with an Asian bank referring to the
two-year old euro zone debt crisis. 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 1.4 percent, following a 1.4 percent gain
in the MSCI world equity index , which posted an
increase for the sixth session in a row on Wednesday.	
 The Nikkei average rose to a four-week high on
Thursday, with shares of major exporters such as Sony Corp
rising as players bought back on tentative signs of
progress in the European debt crisis. 
 
 
 
 VIX EYED	
 In a sign some stability and risk appetite may be returning,
the overall market volatility as measured by the VIX index
, Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge"", has hovered around
30.	
 The level, pulling back sharply from crisis-like levels near
50 hit in August, suggested investors are less inclined to seek
protection in stock index options against an equity market
slide.	
 In credit markets, that had been feeling the strain of
waning confidence in the financial system in recent months,
spreads on the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment grade index
narrowed by about 17 points due to easing worries.	
 Another sign of activity picking up is an expected sale of
3-year, $300 million dollar bonds by China Merchants Bank, the
first such deal out of Asia in a month.	
 But some analysts remained cautious of the latest easing of
tension, seeing it as an adjustment to a recent over-sold
condition and saying the markets were not yet out of the woods.	
 ""The Vix still remains at an elevated level and the recent
decline is merely a rebound from an excessively pessimistic view
in the markets,"" said Junya Tanase, chief strategist at
JPMorgan Chase in Tokyo.	
 ""Rather than a sign of a full-fledged risk-on returning, it
is just an evidence of a slight easing of risk aversion
sentiment.""	
 The euro steadied in Asia on Thursday, having jumped to a
near one-month high on the dollar as Europe took a step closer
to shoring up its financial rescue fund. 
 Lawmakers in Slovakia struck a deal on Wednesday to ratify a
plan to bolster the euro zone's rescue fund by Friday,
effectively ending a crisis that had threatened the currency's
main safety net. Slovakia is the only country in the 17-nation
bloc left to approve the revamp of the fund. 
 Adding to the sense of urgency, the President of the
European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said Europe needed to
take decisive action on Greece and outlined a broad plan to
contain the debt crisis. 
 As European officials step up efforts to provide a more
specific roadmap to resolve its debt woes and recover investor
confidence, the European Union is expected to announce a bank
recapitalization plan designed to cushion the impact any default
by Greece could have on the region's banks.

 Germany and France, the leading powers in the bloc, have
promised to propose a comprehensive strategy to fight the debt
crisis at an EU summit on Oct. 23.	
 
 CHINA SLOWS, IMF WARNS	
 Europe's sovereign debt crisis has dampened investor
sentiment, caused market turmoil and added to uncertainty over
the global economy, which was underscored by China's data.	
 European equities are seen opening lower on Thursday
following sharp gains in the previous session as investors book
profits after weaker-than-expected Chinese trade data suggested
the country was feeling the impact of a global slowdown.	
 Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 were
expected to open down as much as 0.4 percent each.	
 China's trade surplus narrowed in September for a second
straight month as growth of exports and imports both pulled
back, reflecting global economic weakness and domestic cooling.	
 Exports rose 17.1 percent last month from a year ago,
slowing from a 24.5 percent gain in August, and imports
increased 20.9 percent, compared with August's 30.2 percent
rise. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.9 percent on
Thursday, poised to extend a five-session winning streak helped
by mainland property developers that posted strong gains in
contract sales between January and September.	
 Slower demand in the world's second-largest oil consumer
weighed on oil prices, pushing Brent crude  down to near
$111 on Thursday, snapping six days of gains.	
 U.S. November crude  slipped 0.8 percent to $84.86 a
barrel, after tumbling to an intraday low of $84.64. 
 Near-term risks to Asia's economies are ""decidedly"" rising
due to Europe's debt woes and a U.S. slowdown, requiring
policymakers to be nimble and prepared to rapidly reverse
course, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. It
also warned about a risk of capital outflows from the region.

 By Barani Krishnan and Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - World stocks advanced for a
sixth straight day on Wednesday and the euro rose against the
U.S. dollar after the final nation in the euro zone reached a
deal to strengthen a regional bailout fund, boosting investor
confidence.
 On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index compiled
a gain of 9.8 percent over the past seven sessions, its
steepest advance since mid-March 2009.
 ""It feels as though the market is experiencing the
possibility of a melt-up,"" said Hank Smith, chief investment
officer of Haverford Trust Co in Philadelphia.
 ""A lot of people who have been afraid of some of these big,
macro risks are thinking: maybe we should get back in because
this has been a rough year and it would be really rough if we
missed a big fourth quarter,"" he said.
 Another market moving up was oil where Brent crude 
rose for a sixth session to $110.82 a barrel, extending its
gain to more than 11 percent in that period.
 Investor appetite for risk heightened after lawmakers in
Slovakia struck a deal to ratify more powers for the euro
zone's rescue fund, effectively ending for now a crisis for the
euro which also weighed on equities and other risky assets.
 Slovakia is the last country in the 17-member currency zone
left to approve the revamped European Financial Stability
Facility. For details, see [ID:nL5E7LC0JT]
 ""Europeans feel very comfortable that a plan has been put
in place with respect to their banks and Greece, and the EFSF
is going to solve the problem for now,"" said Peter Boockvar,
equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York.
 Investors are also looking to the European Union to
announce a bank recapitalization plan designed to cushion the
impact any default by Greece could have on the region's banks.

 The euro's strong gains also were helped by data showing

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Wednesday
to a near one-month high against the dollar on hopes Slovakia
would eventually approve an expansion of the euro zone rescue
fund critical to containing the region's debt crisis.
 Slovakian lawmakers struck a deal to ratify a plan to
bolster the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) by
Friday, a day after a junior party blocked its passage. For
details, see [ID:nL5E7LC0JT]
 Investors also took comfort from German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's comment that she was certain of full ratification of
the bailout fund's expansion by the Oct. 23 European Union
summit. [ID:nB4E7KT01M]
 Reduced worries about Europe's debt crisis prompted
investors to exit bets against the euro. Gains in the single
currency accelerated after it broke option barriers at $1.37
and resistance in the $1.3815-$1.3820 region, traders said.
 ""Investors are willing to put risk back on the table for
now. As a result, we are seeing an acceleration in net buying
of the euro,"" said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of
global FX strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston.
 The euro  last rose 1.1 percent to $1.3808, after
touching a high of $1.38340 on the EBS trading platform, its
strongest since Sept 16.
 The euro rallied 1.9 percent to 106.57 yen ,
after peaking at 107.035 yen, the highest since Sept. 9.
 Traders said the euro's rise could be limited by lingering
concerns about political hurdles to containing the euro zone
crisis and a deteriorating growth outlook in the region.
 ""This is a short-term technical squeeze without much
fundamental support,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas
G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.
 The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 77.27 yen, having hit a
one-month high of 77.489 on EBS. Against a basket of
currencies, the dollar index <.DXY> fell to a three-week low of
76.796 and was last down 0.9 percent.
 The currency market showed little reaction to minutes from
the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting. [ID:nN1E79B1BJ]

 Republican House Speaker John Boehner said he opposes the
Senate-passed bill, while China urged the Obama administration
to block the proposal. Analysts said it was unlikely the bill
would become law.
 Karl Schamotta, senior market strategist at Western Union
Business Solutions in Calgary, said punishing China for its
undervalued exchange rate will do little to address underlying
imbalances because China would retain a ""significant cost
advantage"" even if the yuan was trading at a market level.
 ""I'd expect to see conciliatory gestures on both sides in
the weeks ahead - possibly including a limited rise in the
exchange rate peg itself,"" he said. ""The lessons of the dirty
thirties have been heeded in many circles - many policymakers
understand that beggar-thy-neighbour simply lowers home values
across the entire neighborhood.""

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Stocks climbed to three-week
highs on Wednesday and the euro rose to its highest in nearly a
month against the dollar after Slovakia reached a deal to
strengthen the euro zone rescue fund, boosting investor
confidence.
 On Wall Street, the S&P 500 traded above 1,200 for the
first time in three weeks, taking the benchmark near the upper
end of a range where it has been stuck since early August. The
S&P has gained over 13 percent from last week's 2011 low while
the Dow industrials turned positive for the year.
 Brent crude oil  rallied for a third straight day
[O/R], helping the 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
<.CRB> climb again after briefly posting losses earlier in the
session.
 Government bond prices fell, with 10-year U.S. Treasury

to tackle the (euro zone) debt crisis. This may continue to

Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets.
 The euro extended gains, helped partly by surprisingly
strong data on the euro zone's August industrial output.
 The euro  rose 1.3 percent against dollar to
$1.38209 after it broke an options barrier at $1.3700. It
touched a high of $1.38340 on the EBS trading platform, its
strongest since Sept. 16.
 The euro also rallied against the yen , up more
than 2 percent, peaking at 107.06 yen, the highest since Sept
9.

 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world
exchanges hit three-week highs on Wednesday while the euro
rose to its highest in a month as investors bet Slovakia would
reach a deal to expand the euro zone's rescue fund.
 Brent crude oil  rallied for a third straight day
[O/R] although a sharp sell-off in grains [GRA/] pushed the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> down 0.2 percent.
 U.S. Treasuries continued Tuesday's downdraft as fewer
investors took to safe-haven bonds amid the growing appetite
for risk. [US/] Gold's safety appeal cooled off some, with
spot bullion  trading around $1.675 an ounce, off its
earlier intraday high above $1,691.
 On Wall Street, stocks climbed more than 1 percent,
extending the rally across Europe.
 ""It's like 'no bad news.' We get to go up as long as you
don't see any horror stories,"" said Frank Lesh, a futures
analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. ""At
the moment, it appears as if Europe has at least contained the
crisis.""
 Slovakia is the last country in the 17-member euro zone
that still needs to approve a plan to strengthen the currency

began talks with the opposition to reach a deal on ratifying
the plan. For details, see [ID:nL5E7LC0JT] and[ID:nTOPEURO]

Wednesday and is designed to cushion the impact any default by
Greece could have on the region's banks.
 ""Markets are clearly still hoping for a comprehensive plan
to tackle the (euro zone) debt crisis. This may continue to
support the market over the next couple of months,"" said
Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis

 The euro extended gains after surprisingly strong data on
the euro zone's August industrial output and as traders exited
short positions against the single currency.
 The euro  rose 1.2 percent against dollar to
$1.38 after it broke an options barrier at $1.3700, which took
it through a series of stop-loss entry orders above that. It
touched a high of $1.38179 on the EBS trading platform, its
strongest since Sept 16.
 It also rallied against the yen , up 1.9 percent

 In contrast, Alcoa Inc  dropped 3.2 percent to
$9.97, after falling nearly 5 percent earlier in the session.
The No. 1 U.S. aluminum producer was one of the biggest drags
on the Dow after its earnings, which were released after
Tuesday's closing bell. Alcoa reported its third-quarter
profit was lower than the second quarter and fell short of
already reduced expectations due to a decline in global metals
prices. [ID:nN1E79A1OO]
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 1.6

 In the U.S. Treasury bond market, investors unloaded bonds
against the backdrop of the increased appetite for stocks and
other risky assets -- and ahead of the auction at 1 p.m. of
$21 billion in reopened 10-year notes.
 The 10-year note  fell 20/32 in price, to yield
2.22 percent, up from 2.208 percent at Tuesday's close. The

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Wednesday to
near one-month highs against the dollar and yen on hopes that
Slovakia eventually would approve an expansion of a program
seen critical to combat the euro zone debt crisis.
 China's yuan was firm against the dollar after the U.S.
Senate passed a trade bill aimed at pressing Beijing to lift
the value of its currency, raising the tension between the
world's two biggest economies. [ID:nL3E7LC02V]
 The tentative optimism over the euro persisted despite the
Slovak parliament's rejection on Tuesday of a plan to
strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
Investors took the view that the remaining member of the
17-nation euro zone block would eventually gather a majority to
endorse the 440-billion-euro scheme. [ID:nL5E7LC0JT]
 ""No one really believes Slovakia is able to stop the
ratification of the EFSF, and that's why euro/dollar is not
lower,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea
in Copenhagen.
 Investors also took comfort from German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's comment that she was certain of ratification of the
bailout fund's expansion by the Oct. 23 European Union summit.
[ID:nB4E7KT01M]
 The euro extended its recent gains after surprisingly
strong data on the region's industrial output in August and as
traders exit short positions against the single currency,
analysts said.
 ""The market is repricing the risk of an 'end-of-the-world'
scenario. The chance of a sharp recession has diminished,"" said
Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 FX strategy at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in New York.
 Traders said the euro  jumped against the dollar
following the break of an options barrier at $1.3700, which
took it through a series of stop-loss entry orders above that.
It gained more than 1 percent on the day to $1.3816 on the EBS
trading platform, its strongest since Sep. 16.
 The euro also rallied against the yen , up 1.85
percent at 106.5 yen, the highest since Sept 15.
 Traders said the euro's rise could be limited as the gains
looked overdone, with concerns lingering about political
hurdles to containing the euro zone crisis.
 ""This is a short-term technical squeeze without much
fundamental support,"" said Bank of America's Upadhyaya.

 U.S.-CHINA TENSION
 Analysts said investors are wary about growing tension
between the United States and China as a trade bill intended to
pressure Beijing to loosen its currency policy makes its way to
the U.S. House of Representative after the U.S. Senate passed
it on Tuesday.
 China urged the Obama administration to block the proposal
that would allow the United States to slap duties on its
products from countries found to be subsidizing their exports
by undervaluing their currencies. [ID:nL3E7LC02V]
 Despite heated exchanges between Washington and Beijing,
analysts said it was unlikley the bill would become law.
 ""As long as China does not believe the United States would
implement it, it is going to ignore it,"" Bank of America's
Upadhyaya said.
 But if chances of its passage grow, China -- which is the
biggest U.S. creditor -- could retaliate, he added.
 Worries of China's retaliatory steps were offset by moves
among government-controlled Chinese banks, which appeared to
have pumped dollars into the market, pushing the yuan to end at
6.3585  a dollar, up from Tuesday's close of 6.3750.
 Outside of the yuan, the dollar touched a three-week low
against a basket of currencies. The dollar index <.DXY> fell
0.6 percent at 77.108, above an earlier low of 76.796.

 By Jessica Mortimer	
 LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week high
versus the dollar on Wednesday on tentative optimism that
European leaders would reach agreement on a way to resolve the
euro zone debt crisis.	
 The euro recovered from earlier falls, made after Slovakia
rejected on Tuesday a plan to expand the euro zone rescue fund,
as investors took the view the government would eventually
endorse the scheme.	
 Traders said the euro extended gains following the break of
an options barrier at $1.3700. They added that the single
currency was benefiting from investors taking profit on previous
short positions.	
 Gains were expected to be limited, however, as concerns
lingered about political hurdles that could hamper efforts to
prevent contagion from the crisis. 
 The euro rose 0.8 percent to a high of $1.3761, with
traders saying stops were taken out on the break of $1.3710.
This pushed it well above a trough of $1.3582 hit in Asian trade
in a knee-jerk response to the Slovak vote. 
 Technical support was seen around $1.3520-25 -- the 50
percent retracement of the $1.3346-1.3698 rally.	
 Traders took some comfort as German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said she was certain there would be full ratification of the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) by the time of the
Oct. 23 European Union summit. 
 ""No one really believes Slovakia is able to stop the
ratification of the EFSF and that's why euro/dollar is not
lower,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen. 
 A spokesman for the senior government party in Slovakia --
the only euro zone country yet to ratify the EFSF expansion --
said parties would start talks on Wednesday and a new vote could
be held as soon as Thursday. 
 Sentiment was also helped after inspectors from the 'troika'
of the European Union, IMF and European Central Bank said on
Tuesday an 8 billion euro loan tranche to Greece should be paid
in early November. 
 Against the yen, the euro also hit a three-week high of
105.30 yen , with traders saying an options barrier at
105.00 yen was taken out. It was well above a 10-year low hit
last week at 100.77 yen. 
 Nordea's Christensen said movements in equities could be the
main driver of currencies in the near term, with the focus on
the U.S. earnings season and on company outlooks.	
 
 CHINA BILL	
 However, analysts said bickering between the United States
and China over a bill aimed at pressing Beijing to lift the
value of the yuan could adversely affect
sentiment towards the euro and other riskier assets. 
 
 
 ""A few risk factors emerged overnight prompting investors to
sell riskier assets, but key support levels so far remain
intact, indicating that investors are waiting for more news from
Europe,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo.	
 The growth-linked and higher-risk Australian dollar jumped
nearly 1 percent to a three-week high of $1.0068 ,
helped by reported Asian buying.	
 The dollar index hit a three-week low of 77.073, some
distance away from an 8-1/2 month peak of 79.838 set on Oct. 4. 
 Against the Japanese currency, the dollar was down 0.3
percent at 76.40 .	
 The danger of yen-weakening intervention by Japanese
authorities has seen the dollar/yen pair stuck in a narrow band
off a record low around 75.94 yen set in August.

 LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro hit
3-week highs on Wednesday while top-rated government bonds fell
as investors looked to Slovakia to reach a deal on expanding the
euro zone's rescue fund, enabling leaders to intensify efforts
to tackle a debt crisis.	
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel also voiced confidence,
saying she was certain that by the time of the European Union
summit on Oct. 23 there would be full ratification of the
European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) .	
 Germany and France have promised to come up with a
comprehensive plan to fight a crisis that has dominated markets'
thinking this year and prompted fears of turmoil to rival that
when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.	
 After an initial rejection on Tuesday, Slovakia's political
parties will hold talks later to reach an agreement on a plan to
give the EFSF bigger powers to fight the crisis. A new vote
could be held as soon as Thursday.	
 Investors are also looking to the European Union to announce
a bank recapitalisation plan due later on Wednesday, designed to
cushion the impact of a possible default by Greece on the
region's banks.	
 ""Markets are clearly still hoping for a comprehensive plan
to tackle the (euro zone) debt crises. This may continue to
support the market over the next couple of months,"" said
Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets. 
 ""In Slovakia, a 'yes' vote may follow shortly. However, it
once again demonstrates how difficult a democratic decision
process with 17 members (of the euro zone bloc) may be."" 
 The MSCI world equity index erased initial
losses to gain 0.7 percent. The benchmark index is now 11
percent above a 15-month low hit earlier in October.	
 European stocks rose 0.7 percent to a five-week
high while emerging stocks rose 1.3 percent, thanks to
a rebound in Chinese shares .	
 ""I can see how people might say it's not as bad as some were
fearing a few weeks ago. A lot of economic indicators are
suggesting that things are ticking along,"" said Bill Dinning, at
Kames Capital in Edinburgh, which has 48.8 billion pounds ($76
billion) under management. 
 ""But I'm struggling to be optimistic. It's still a low
growth environment. If there were some kind of credible policy
announcement in Europe, that would do a lot for sentiment."" 
 U.S. stock futures were up 0.7 percent , pointing to a
firmer open on Wall Street later after Alcoa kicked off
the third-quarter earnings season on a weak note on Tuesday. 
 U.S. crude oil  rose 0.3 percent to $85.53 a barrel.	
 The euro gained 1.1 percent to $1.3800. The dollar
fell 0.8 percent against a basket of major currencies. 
 Bund futures  erased early gains to fall 73 ticks
after the German auction of 1.625 billion euros of 30-year
bonds drew less bids than the amount on offer, with demand below
the average at long-term auctions this year. 
 Before the German auction, the ECB said it lent banks $1.35
billion, a fifth of the demand forecast in a Reuters poll of
money markets traders early this week. Only 6 banks bid for the
three-month funds, easing some concerns that European banks were
facing acute problems accessing dollars in the market.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Wednesday,
taking a break from its recent corrective rally made on hopes
for a solution to the debt crisis, with fragile risk sentiment
souring after the Slovak parliament rejected a plan to expand
the euro zone rescue fund.	
 But the euro and the Australian dollar managed to come off
intraday lows after a rebound in Shanghai stocks on talk that
the country's sovereign wealth fund has been supporting bank
shares. 
 The Slovakian main opposition party was likely to support
the rescue fund measure in another vote this week after the
government has resigned, but the twist has added to market
nervousness just as EU authorities are working on concrete steps
to avoid a wider contagion. 
 Sentiment was also hit by bickering between the United
States and China over a bill aimed at pressing Beijing to lift
the value of the yuan and a fall in U.S. stocks futures <0#es:>
after Alcoa's results highlighted the impact of Europe's debt
crisis on earnings. 
 ""A few risk factors emerged overnight prompting investors to
sell riskier assets, but key support levels so far remain
intact, indicating that investors are waiting for more news from
Europe,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 Tokyo exporters took the opportunity to sell the euro
against the yen after the common currency had gained nearly 4
percent in the week, piling pressure on euro/dollar. Option
barriers reported at 105 yen and $1.37 in the pairs also helped
halt the recent rally.	
 The euro last changed hands 0.2 percent lower at $1.3617
, off an intraday trough of $1.3582.	
 Support is seen around $1.3520-25 -- the 50 percent
retracement of the $1.3346-1.3698 rally, while stop losses were
cited around $1.3710.	
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.1 percent at 104.43
, off a 10-year low hit last week at 100.77 yen.	
 For the Australian currency, selling first emerged from
Japanese life insurers in Aussie/yen, pushing it down 0.4
percent versus the greenback to last trade at $0.9919 ,
above the strong technical support area of $0.9880-50. 
 Analysts stressed that euro price moves will likely be
subdued before the details of a comprehensive strategy to fight
the debt crisis are revealed at an EU summit on Oct. 23.	
 Banking and regulatory sources said on Tuesday that Europe's
banks would have to achieve a significantly stronger capital
position under a quick-fire regulatory health check and may need
to raise some 100 billion euros ($137 billion). 
 Traders said that for now they were waiting for a speech by
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is set to
propose a bank recapitalisation plan on Wednesday.

 
 
 CHINA BILL	
 China urged the Obama administration and Congress to stymie
the U.S. yuan bill, warning the legislation passed by the Senate
could upset efforts to prop up the global economy.	
 The fate of the bill in the Republican-dominated House of
Representatives, however, remains unclear after critical
comments from senior Republicans and no clear stance taken by
President Barack Obama.	
 The dollar index gained to 77.76 on the day, but was
still some distance away from an 8-1/2 month peak of 79.838 set
on Oct. 4. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar was at
76.71 , trading in an ever-tightening range.	
 The danger of yen-weakening intervention by Japanese
authorities has seen the dollar/yen pair stuck in a narrow band
off a record low around 75.94 yen set in August.	
 In addition to Barosso, investors are waiting for minutes of
the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting due later on
Wednesday. Barclays Capital analysts expect the minutes to show
most policymakers continued to expect a rebound in growth in the
second half relative to the first half, but that risks remain
skewed to the downside. 
 ""We will also be paying close attention to how the
committee's views on the inflation outlook have evolved,"" they
wrote in a note.	
 ""The majority continues to judge that spare capacity will
put downward pressure on core inflation, but several members are
likely to share our view that spare capacity is limited and
will, therefore, be less convinced that core inflation will
subside.""

 By Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - A rebound in Chinese shares helped
lift most Asian stocks into positive territory on Wednesday, but
gains were limited by concerns that the threat posed to the
global economic outlook by Europe's debt crisis is weighing on
corporate earnings.	
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  fell 0.2 percent,
pointing to a weaker start for European blue chips. Futures for
Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40  fell around
0.4 percent, while financial spreadbetters called the FTSE 100
to open down about 0.7 percent. 
 The strength in Chinese stocks trimmed losses in Japan, but
growth-sensitive Asian shares remained weak and an uncertain
outlook for demand dragged on industrial commodities such as
oil.	
 Concerns that the Slovak parliament's rejection of a plan to
expand the euro zone rescue fund could slow efforts to contain
the region's debt woes and prevent a full-blown banking crisis
led to a widening in Asian credit spreads.	
 ""The broader trend is dictated by the problems in Europe,
and Slovakia's rejection was negative to sentiment, as beefing
up the fund is vital in providing a sense of security,"" said
Hirokazu Yuihama, senior strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets.	
 S&P 500 futures  eased after below-forecast results
from Alcoa Inc. that could sour the mood on Wall Street
later, as attention turns to the U.S. earnings season.	
 
 Slovakia is the only euro zone country that has yet to
approve a plan to boost the funds available to the bloc's
bailout vehicle, and a re-vote was expected later this week.

 While the main opposition party was set to support the
measure now the government has resigned, the twist has added to
market nervousness just as European authorities were striving to
come up with concrete steps to avoid a wider contagion.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.4 percent, but the materials sector
bucked the trend and fell 0.6 percent.	
 The Shanghai Composite was up 2.6 percent, lifting
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index 1 percent.	
 Chinese authorities stepped in to bolster financial shares
this week when Central Huijin, the domestic investment arm of
the country's sovereign wealth fund, bought shares in the ""Big
Four"" Chinese banks.	
 ""It's quite possible that Huijin has gone back to the market
to buy more bank shares this morning,"" said a trader at a major
Chinese brokerage in Shanghai. 
 Japan's Nikkei average trimmed earlier losses but
still closed down 0.4 percent, after Alcoa Inc, the largest U.S.
aluminium producer, said on Tuesday slowing economic growth
knocked prices for the metal lower, denting its third-quarter
profit and sending its shares down in after-hours trading.

 ""Those who were looking for reassurance about the U.S.
earnings season didn't find it,"" said Kenichi Hirano, operating
officer at Tachibana Securities. 
 Asian credit markets reflected renewed bearish sentiment,
with the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment grade index
widening by as much as about 15 points. 
 A Hong Kong based fund manager said recent market gains were
largely a technical rebound from last month's sell-off, adding
that a lack of inflows from pension and mutual funds, so-called
real money, was stymieing new bond corporate issues.	
 ""All that you are seeing now is short-covering and fast
money. There is no fund inflows into Asia and at this point no
issuer can come to the market. Will they (issuers) pay up? I
doubt it,"" the fund manager said.	
 
 GROWTH WORRIES 
 Oil struggled, after OPEC cut its global oil demand forecast
and as the Slovak hitch in the euro zone bailout fund plan
rattled investors' confidence across asset classes. 
 Brent crude  was up a touch at $110.80 a barrel, but
U.S. crude futures  fell 0.4 percent to $85.49.	
 Industrial metals such as copper recouped earlier losses on
a steep rise in Shanghai shares, short-covering and some
restocking in China, but investors were cautious about an
economic slowdown ahead of Chinese economic data due later in
the week, including inflation and trade balance figures.	
 The euro struggled to make headway, as a recent rally
stalled after the Slovak vote, trading flat on Wednesday at
$1.3640. 
 Market sentiment had improved this week, after a weekend
pledge by German and French leaders to come up with a plan to
tackle the debt crisis.	
 Banking and regulatory sources said on Tuesday that Europe's
banks would have to achieve a significantly stronger capital
position under a quick-fire regulatory health check and may need
to raise some 100 billion euros ($137 billion). 
 Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Union's
executive European Commission, said he would propose a bank
recapitalisation plan on Wednesday, even though there is no
agreement yet on where the money will come from. 
 Rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings
downgraded Spanish and Italian banks on Tuesday, underscoring
concerns about the impact of the escalating debt crisis on the
sector.

 NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Stocks ended a volatile
session with slight gains and commodities extended their rally
on Tuesday as investors held back from big bets ahead of U.S.
earnings reports, as well as on concerns about the euro zone
debt crisis.
 Wall Street stocks settled in mostly positive territory --
helped by bets on third-quarter results from aluminum producer
Alcoa Inc  -- while sentiment was still fragile from the
sell-off of the past month.
 ""Earnings are always important but even more so here after
several quarters of solid earnings across many industry
sectors. I think investors are going to want to see that
continuing or solidifying itself,"" said Michael Cuggino,
president and portfolio manager of Permanent Portfolio Funds in
San Francisco.
 ""Otherwise, you could see further sell-offs,"" he added.
 In commodities trading, crude oil  settled up 1.5
percent at above $110 a barrel in London.
 Agricultural markets in Chicago surged, with wheat 
rising over 8 percent -- its most in a year -- to finish above
$6.60 a bushel on bets that a U.S. government crop report due
Wednesday would show smaller-than-expected grain stockpiles.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> lost 16.88 points,
or 0.15 percent, to end at 11,416.30. But the benchmark
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 0.65 point, or 0.05
percent, to 1,195.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up
16.98 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,583.03.
 ""The market was overshot on the downside and now we're
making it up to a certain degree,"" said Wayne Kaufman, chief
market strategist at John Thomas Financial in New York.
 In Monday's trading, the S&P jumped 3 percent, lifting the
index above its 50-day moving average the first time since late
July, though the gains came on thin volume due to the Columbus
Day holiday.
 With the S&P near the upper end of its recent range, it is
unclear whether institutional buyers will support the market
further or if it will retreat.
 Alcoa's stock  closed up 2 percent at $10.30, making
it the best performer in the Dow. The top U.S. aluminum
producer reported higher revenue and earnings in the third
quarter from a year ago, though results were down from the
second quarter of this year. [ID:nASA02XLI]
 Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's All-Country World
index <.MIWD00000PUS>, gained 0.4 percent. The index has
rallied recently on improved sentiment, particularly after a
weekend pledge by German and French leaders to come up with a
plan to tackle the debt crisis. [ID:nP7E7KK00E]
 A new twist emerged this week in the Europe's financial
debacle as investors nervously awaited Slovakia to become the
last of 17 EU member states to vote to boost the size and
powers of the European Financial Stability Facility.
 A delay in a key vote by Slovakia on expanding the euro
zone rescue fund kept investors cautious. [ID:nL5E7LB0V9]
 The vote in Slovakia's parliament may not pass until later
this week, complicating access to funds that could stem the
crisis. That may rattle markets through the week, as it adds an
element of uncertainty to a fragile trading environment.
 ""It seems like the vote is a little in doubt. Everyone is
on hold waiting on what's happening with the European Union,""
said Ronald Simpson, managing director of global currency
analysis at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida.
 The euro initially fell on Tuesday after the latest twist
in Europe's financial debacle, before rebounding.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares,
closed down 0.3 percent, after rising 1.7 percent on Monday.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell, erasing gains that brought
benchmark yields to historic lows last week, as investors' most
acute anxiety over Europe's debt crisis subsided. The benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 23/32 from
Friday, its yield at 2.1567 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The euro traded little changed
against the dollar on Tuesday, surrendering early gains after
the Slovak Parliament rejected the plan to expand the euro zone
rescue fund.
 The Slovak government also lost a confidence vote but the
European Financial Stability Facility package is expected to go
through in a later re-vote because the outgoing prime minister
planned to ask for help from the opposition.
 Moves in the euro were limited, however, as the result had
been anticipated after a junior party in the coalition said it
would abstain.
 ""What it does do though is it throws markets into limbo now
for the next couple of days until the Slovakians organize a new
government and ultimately get the EFSF up for a second vote,
when it's expected to pass,"" said Brian Dolan. chief strategist
at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The euro  last traded little changed at $1.3637,
above an earlier low of $1.3565 set on trading platform EBS. In
the near term, traders said the euro will likely consolidate in
a range of $1.3550 to $1.37.
 Against the yen, the euro was also flat at 104.54
.
 The euro earlier rose against the dollar after U.S. stocks
rebounded from early lows. The common currency's recent move
has correlated closely with investor appetite for stocks and
other risky assets.
 A lasting euro rally was still unlikely, however, given a
lack of the details of European policymakers' plans to
recapitalize banks amid speculation Greece would eventually
default on its debt.
 The EU, International Monetary Fund and European Central
Bank -- known as the troika -- said an eight-billion-euro loan
tranche to Greece should be paid in early November but they
warned Athens it had made only patchy progress in meeting the
terms of a bailout agreed in May last year. [ID:nL5E7LB1JM]
 ""I am still skeptical that a comprehensive plan will be
really in place by early November,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
""The key risk is that Greece is insolvent and will likely
default on its debt.""

 CHINA BILL
 The greenback held steady at 76.66 yen , not far from
a record low near 75.94 yen set in August. Against a basket of
currencies, the dollar index rose 0.2 percent to 77.665
<.DXY>.
 Also on Tuesday, the U.S. Senate is set to vote on a trade
bill aimed at pressuring China to allow its yuan currency to
appreciate further against the dollar.
 Ahead of the Senate vote on the China trade bill, spot yuan
 closed at 6.3750 against the dollar, slightly weaker
than 6.3486 at the close on Monday, when it strengthened 0.59
percent in its biggest daily rise since its 2.1 percent
revaluation in July 2005.
 The Chinese currency has appreciated 30.3 percent since
then, including the revaluation.
 Washington and Beijing have exchanged heated remarks over
this latest bill but analysts see little chance of passage.

 NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Stocks were choppy and
commodities extended their rally on Tuesday as uncertainty over
the euro zone rescue fund hung over markets before the start of
the U.S. earnings report season.
 With sentiment still fragile after the pummeling markets
took in the past month, stocks swung back-and-forth ahead of
third-quarter results from aluminum producer Alcoa Inc .
 ""The market was overshot on the downside and now we're
making it up to a certain degree,"" said Wayne Kaufman, chief

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose modestly and
Treasuries slipped in early trading on Tuesday as markets
awaited a vote by Slovakia on expanding the euro zone rescue
fund, the latest twist in Europe's financial debacle.
 The euro fell as investors waited for Slovakia to become
the last of 17 EU member states to vote to boost the size and
powers of the European Financial Stability Facility.
 The vote in Slovakia's parliament may not pass until later
this week, complicating access to funds that could stem the
crisis. For more, see: [ID:nL5E7LB0V9]
 That may rattle markets through the week as it adds an
element of uncertainty to an already anxious environment.
Global stocks and the euro have rallied sharply on rising hopes
that Europe will recapitalize struggling banks and bail out
debtor nations.
 Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's All-Country World
index <.MIWD00000PUS>, climbed into positive territory, up 0.5
percent. The index has rallied on improved sentiment,
particularly after a weekend pledge by German and French
leaders to come up with a plan to tackle the debt crisis.
[ID:nP7E7KK00E]
 U.S. stocks jumped 3 percent on Monday, lifting the S&P
500 above its 50-day moving average the first time since late
July, though the gains came on thin volume due to the Columbus
Day holiday.
 The benchmark S&P is trading near the upper end of its
recent range, and it is unclear whether institutional buyers
will support the market further or if it will retreat.
 ""I have not seen yet a tremendous amount of long-only
(fund) participation in this. It's mostly hedge fund-to-hedge
-fund pinging stocks back and forth,"" said Sam Ginzburg, head
of capital markets at First New York in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 1.78 points,
or 0.02 percent, at 11,434.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 3.26 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,198.15. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 19.00 points, or 0.74
percent, at 2,585.05.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 0.1 percent at 962.61, after rising 1.7 percent on
Monday.
 The euro  slipped 0.1 percent at $1.3623 against the
dollar.
 In commodity markets, Brent crude oil  was up 0.3
percent, hovering around $109 per barrel.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell, erasing gains that brought
benchmark yields to historic lows last week, as investors' most
acute anxiety over Europe's debt crisis subsided. The benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 28/32 from
Friday, its yield at 2.1745 percent.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday on
caution ahead of a Slovak vote on changes to the euro zone's
financial rescue fund and word on whether Greece will receive
its next round of a loan to avert a debt default.
 In other developments, the U.S. Senate is set to vote on
Tuesday on a trade bill aimed at pressuring China to allow its
yuan currency  to appreciate further against the dollar.
 Slovakia is the last of the euro zone's 17 members to
decide on changes to the 440-billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility. Its lawmakers began debate on the issue and
its finance minister said the country is expected to approve
the changes this week. For more see [ID:nP7E7LA003].
 News of a split within the Slovak ruling coalition caused
some jitters over the outcome of the vote, spurring
profit-taking on the euro a day after it recorded its biggest
gain in 15 months.
 The European Union, IMF and European Central Bank -- known
as the ""troika"" -- said an eight billion euros loan tranche to
Greece should be paid in early November, but they warned Athens
had made only patchy progress in meeting the terms of a bailout
agreed in May last year. [ID:nL5E7LB1JM]
 ""Some of the latest developments from Europe are prompting
a bit of profit-taking in the euro. The overall expectation is
that they will pass it,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 The euro  was down 0.45 percent at $1.3583 after
jumping 2 percent on Monday to a near three-week high of
$1.3698.
 Monday's rally followed a Franco-German pledge that they
would do what was required to shore up banks, settle the Greek
crisis and accelerate economic coordination in the euro zone.
[ID:nL5E7L90LY]
 Analysts said the euro could still rise in the near term
given a recent build-up in short euro positions.
 ""The euro can go higher because short positioning is still
extreme. Monday's rally only partially offset that position.""
said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
shows currency speculators increased their net short positions
in the euro to 82,697 contracts in the week ended Oct. 4, the
biggest in four months. <1099741NNET> [IMM/FX]
 A lasting euro rally was still unlikely, however, given
uncertainty over the details of European policymakers' plans to
recapitalize banks in the face of expectations that Greece
could default on its debts, keeping investors wary of
establishing outright long positions in the common currency.
 ""I am still skeptical that a comprehensive plan will be
really in place by early November,"" said Commonwealth's Esiner.
""The key risk is that Greece is insolvent and will likely
default on its debt.""
 Risk-reversals, a measure of the premium required to hold a
put or a call in a currency, show investors hedging against a
fall in the euro. The one-month 25-delta risk-reversal traded
around 2.55 for euro puts, compared to 2.80 at the end of last
week .

 DOLLAR FIRM
 While developments in Europe remain a key driver, a drop in
fears about a new U.S. recession after last week's
less-grim-than-expected payrolls report has helped the dollar.
 The greenback held steady at 76.69 yen , not far from
a record low near 75.94 yen set in August.
 The dollar was up 0.68 percent against the Swiss franc at
0.9098 franc  after falling more than 2 percent on Monday
when the U.S. currency came under heavy selling pressure as
equity markets rose and appetite for risk improved on optimism
over the euro crisis.
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent against a basket of
currencies <.DXY> at 77.88.
 Ahead of the Senate vote on the China trade bill, spot yuan
 last traded at 6.3750 against the dollar, slightly
weaker than 6.3486 at the close on Tuesday, when it
strengthened 0.59 percent in its biggest daily rise since its
2.1 percent revaluation in July 2005. It has now appreciated
30.3 percent since then, including the revaluation.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The euro on Tuesday clung to
the previous day's huge gains after hopes for a new EU debt plan
sparked a correction in a deeply bearish market, though
sentiment remains fragile as European leaders have disappointed
many times before.	
 The euro, which on Monday surged 2 percent for its
biggest daily percentage gain in 15 months, held steady at
$1.3642 . 
 Monday's rally followed an Franco-German pledge on Sunday
that they would do what is necessary to shore up banks, settle
the Greek crisis and help growth in Europe. 
 Market players said the single currency could rise further
in the near term given a recent build-up in short euro
positions, but added that a sustained rebound was unlikely.	
 ""An image of the euro falling without limit is receding, but
unless there is some kind of fundamental solution, a clear break
above $1.40 will probably be difficult,"" said Satoshi Okagawa,
senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation in Singapore.	
 ""There could be some short-covering for a while, in the wake
of its selloff,"" Okagawa said.	
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission shows that currency speculators increased their net
short positions in the euro to 82,697 contracts in the week
ended Oct. 4, the biggest in four months. 
 A trader for a European bank in Singapore said the euro
still looked well bid with bids mainly near $1.3600, although
offers were accumulating at levels above $1.3700.	
 Major resistance for the euro is found at $1.3680-90, the
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the $1.4550/$1.3145 move
and the Sept. 28 trend high. A clear break above $1.3700 targets
$1.3845.	
 Dealers were surprised by the scale of the reaction to the
Franco-German pledge, given EU leaders have disappointed many
times in the past. 
 ""Unfortunately, Europe has a history of delivering far too
little far too late,"" said Robert Rennie, chief currency
strategist at Westpac.	
 ""Europe doesn't have the political will, the cohesion and
the sense of what needs to be done.""	
 He said the rally was temporary and that he would be looking
to sell the euro into strength, which means in the $1.365-$1.385
range.	
 
 AUSSIE FACES RESISTANCE	
 Investors were looking for an excuse to price out bad news
that has gripped markets since September. While there is little
doubt the problems in Europe will resurface at some stage,
recent economic data was better than feared, reducing the danger
of a global recession, 
 In a sign that emerging Asian currencies were starting to
stabilise after their sell-off in September, the spread between
one-month non-deliverable dollar/rupiah forwards
and onshore outright forwards dipped back into minus
and returned to levels last seen in early September, just before
a selloff in emerging Asian currencies gained steam.	
 The spread had ballooned to a peak of plus 605 points on
Sept 22, as dollar/rupiah NDFs surged on buying from offshore
investors looking to hedge their rupiah exposure. 
 ""The market has calmed down a lot and we are back to where
we were right at the start of the market turmoil,"" said Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp's Okagawa. Financial markets overall,
however, still seemed jittery, with dollar funding markets still
showing signs of strain, he added. 
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.9981
, giving back a bit of its gains after climbing 2.4
percent on Monday, its biggest one-day rally since June 2010.	
 The Aussie faces stiff resistance looming at the broken
trend line on its weekly charts around $1.0010-30 , and
also at $1.0035 -- a 38.2% retracement of its slide from a
$1.1081 high in late July to a $0.9388 trough plumbed in early
October. 
 Traders will focus on voting in Slovakia on Tuesday, the
only country among the bloc's 17 members that has yet to ratify
changes to the euro zone's 440-billion-euro bailout fund. Any
delay on passing the legislation could affect sentiment toward
the euro. Malta gave its backing on Monday .

 The dollar held steady at 76.68 yen , still not far
from a record low near 75.95 yen struck in August.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Tuesday
after China moved to support its stock market by buying shares
of major banks, and the euro held the previous session's big
gains on hopes that European leaders are finally taking action
to protect the continent's lenders.	
 European stock index futures pointed to a steady start after
four straight sessions of gains while U.S. futures were mildly
weaker.	
 World stocks clambered out of bear market territory on
Monday after a pledge from German and French leaders to come up
with a plan by the end of the month to tackle Greece's
confidence-sapping debt woes and recapitalise European banks.	
 ""I think it is significant that Germany and France came
together to show they will not allow big banks to collapse,""
said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities in
Tokyo. ""Hopes that there won't be an abandoned bank like Lehman
will ease excessive worries in the market.""	
 Commodities were steady after surging on Monday as money
flowed back into riskier assets.	
 
 
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  futures rose 0.1
percent. Futures for Germany's DAX  gained 0.2 percent
and France's CAC-40 futures  were flat, while financial
spreadbetters called the FTSE 100 to open down 0.1
percent. S&P 500 futures  fell 0.2 percent. 
 Shares in China's big four banks leapt after the domestic
arm of the country's sovereign wealth fund bought their shares
in the secondary market on Monday, in Beijing's first move to
support stock prices since the 2008 financial crisis.	
 But market players remained cautious, with early gains in
Shanghai fading. The benchmark mainland stock index has
lost nearly 17 percent this year amid growing concerns of a
""hard landing"" for the economy.	
 ""This is psychological more than anything fundamental,"" said
Cheng Yi, senior analyst at Xiangcai Securities in Shanghai. ""If
2008 offers any indication, we could see stock prices dip after
an initial boost.""	
 Japan's Nikkei share average closed up 2 percent,
partly catching up with gains elsewhere in the region on Monday,
when Tokyo was shut for a holiday. 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
also rose 2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng
rallied 2.7 percent, but Shanghai's benchmark gave up its
early gains and was off 0.1 percent. 
 
 RECAPITALISE BANKS	
 Global markets were buoyed after German Chancellor Angela
Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said they would
agree on how to recapitalise European banks and present a plan
for accelerating economic coordination in the euro zone by a G20
summit in Cannes on Nov. 3-4. 
 ""That is both a positive and a negative,"" said Dan
Greenhaus, New York-based chief global strategist at
broker-dealer BTIG. ""It was negative in that no specific details
were provided, but positive that they have given a self-imposed
deadline.""	
 Greenhaus told Asia-based reporters on a conference call
that BTIG believed Europe's banking sector would need an
injection of 300-500 billion euros.	
 ""Ultimately the major banks need to be recapitalised, but
not recapitalised by an unreachable amount of money,"" he said.	
 Wall Street stocks rose more than 3 percent on Monday
and European shares gained nearly 2 percent. 
 MSCI's All-Country World index now stands
around 18 percent below its May high for the year after climbing
above the 20 percent loss level -- the rule-of-thumb definition
of a bear market -- on Monday.	
 
 FUNDAMENTAL SOLUTION	
 The euro was virtually unchanged around $1.3640 on
Tuesday, after surging as much as 3 cents to a high just below
$1.37 in the previous session. The single currency edged up
against the yen to around 104.60 . 
 ""An image of the euro falling without limit is receding, but
unless there is some kind of fundamental solution, a clear break
above $1.40 will probably be difficult,"" said Satoshi Okagawa,
senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation in Singapore.	
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies
, but U.S. Treasuries fell as investors appetite for
riskier assets returned, with the 10-year yield
rising 10 basis points to around 2.164 percent. 
 A rebound in credit markets continued with spreads
tightening about 12 basis points on iTraxx's Asia ex-Japan
investment grade index , while regional interest
rate swap curves were mostly higher and steeper.	
 Oil was slightly lower after rallying 3 percent on Monday,
with U.S. crude  down 11 cents at $85.31 a barrel and
Brent crude  shedding 20 cents to $108.75. 
 Gold, which in recent weeks has switched from a negative to
a positive correlation with riskier assets such as industrial
commodities and stocks as safe haven investors turned to the
dollar, rose 0.2 percent to around $1,678 an ounce. 
 ""As the news revived risk appetite, some money was being
moved out of the money market to commodities, including gold,""
said Hou Xinqiang, an analyst at Jinrui Futures in China.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro jumped while world
stocks and crude oil rallied for a fourth straight session on
Monday following a pledge by Germany and France to unveil new
measures to solve the festering European debt crisis.
 Wall Street gained 3 percent and European markets rose
almost 2 percent after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Sunday their goal was
to come up with a sustainable answer for Greece's debt woes.
 The S&P 500 rose above its 50-day moving average for the
first time since late July, a bullish technical signal on Wall
Street, while stocks rose across the board in Europe, with
economically sensitive sectors performing the best.
 The euro rose the most against the U.S. dollar in 15 months
while oil settled about 3 percent higher. Still, skepticism was
high, given the lack of detail on the European leaders' plans.
 ""For now, the markets are rallying on the belief that there
is forward momentum on dealing with the European bank crisis,""
said Andrew Busch, senior currency strategist at BMO Capital
Markets.
 ""To me, this is an exercise in placing funding sand bags
around the global banks to ensure they are not flooded by the
rising river level of a Greek default,"" he said.
 Merkel and Sarkozy said they would agree on how to
recapitalize European banks and present a plan for accelerating
economic coordination in the euro zone by a G20 summit in
Cannes, France on Nov. 3-4. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L90RP]
 A spokesman for the German government emphasized that the
talks are no ""miracle cure."" [ID:nL5E7LA1M7]
 Sentiment was also bolstered on news that French and
Italian industrial output was surprisingly strong in August,
while German exports were at a record high. [ID:nL5E7LA1S9]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 330.06
points, or 2.97 percent, at 11,433.18. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 39.43 points, or 3.41 percent, at
1,194.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 86.70
points, or 3.50 percent, at 2,566.05.
 World stocks rose sharply, climbing 2.6 percent as measured
by MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS>.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European
regional shares posted a 1.7 percent gain to 963.89, the
highest close in more than five weeks.
 The benchmark index of European shares and the S&P 500 are
both up about 10 percent since the U.S. benchmark briefly
entered bear market territory -- considered a 20 percent drop
from its recent peak -- at the session's low on Oct. 4.
 The KBW index of banking shares <.BKX> jumped 5.3 percent,
with JPMorgan Chase & Co  gaining 5.2 percent to $32.30
and Bank of America  climbing 6.4 percent to $6.28.
 The gains, however, came on the lightest day of trading in
more than two months and may not be indicative of a long-term
trend. The advance has been driven by short-covering and
managers buying stocks as they try to catch up to the sharp
rally built on headlines out of Europe.
 ""There's basically a rally coming off deeply oversold
levels. It seem like investors are reacting to even neutral
signs of hope the European debt situation will be solved,"" said
Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at The Davidson Cos. in
Lake Oswego, Oregon.
 ""Traders are shorting the dollar, and using funds there and
piling into risk-based assets,"" including equities, he said.
 A move to nationalize Franco-Belgian bank Dexia 
also bolstered sentiment, since it was seen as an indication
that governments would step in and keep large lenders from
going under. [ID:nL5E7L90W7]]
 The Dexia rescue showed European governments ""can act
quickly and decisively,"" boosting hopes for real results on
Merkel's and Sarkozy's promises, said Quincy Krosby, market
strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
 Extended short bets in the euro added to the currency's
momentum as traders rushed to exit positions, lifting the
single currency more than 2 percent to a near three-week high.
 The euro, which was on track for its best daily rise since
July 2010, climbed 1.9 percent to $1.3647 after paring some
earlier gains.
 ""We're seeing risk coming back on and that's helping the
euro,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at
brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Crude oil rose on improved optimism. November Brent crude
futures  settled up $3.07 at $108.95, while U.S.
November crude  rose $2.43 to settle at $85.41.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$35 at $1,670.80 an ounce.
 Spot gold prices  rose $37.80 to $1,676.30 an ounce.
 The market for U.S. Treasuries was closed in observance of
the Columbus Day holiday.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - World stocks and crude oil
rallied for a fourth straight session on Monday while the euro
jumped after Germany and France pledged to unveil new measures
to resolve a festering euro zone debt crisis within a month.
 Wall Street gained more than 2 percent and European markets
rose almost as much after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Sunday their goal was
to come up with a sustainable answer for Greece's debt woes.
 Stocks rose across the board in Europe, with economically
sensitive sectors performing best, and the S&P 500's 50-day
moving average signaled a bullish trend on Wall Street.
 The euro rose the most against the U.S. dollar in 15 months
while oil settled about 3 percent higher. Still, skepticism was
high given the lack of detail on the European leaders' plans.
 ""For now, the markets are rallying on the belief that there
is forward momentum on dealing with the European bank crisis,""
said Andrew Busch, senior currency strategist at BMO Capital
Markets.
 ""To me, this is an exercise in placing funding sand bags
around the global banks to ensure they are not flooded by the
rising river level of a Greek default,"" he said.
 Merkel and Sarkozy said they would agree on how to
recapitalize European banks and present a plan for accelerating
economic coordination in the euro zone by a G20 summit in
Cannes, France on Nov. 3-4. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L90RP]
 A spokesman for the German government emphasized that the
talks are no ""miracle cure."" [ID:nL5E7LA1M7]
 Sentiment was also bolstered on news that French and
Italian industrial output was surprisingly strong in August,
while German exports were at a record high. [ID:nL5E7LA1S9]
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 232.88 points, or 2.10 percent, at 11,336.00. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 27.66 points, or 2.39 percent,
at 1,183.12. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 57.55
points, or 2.32 percent, at 2,536.90.
 World stocks gained, rising 2.3 percent as measured by
MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS>.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European
regional shares rose 1.7 percent to 963.89, the highest close
in more than five weeks.
 The benchmark index of European shares and the S&P 500 are
both up about 10 percent since the U.S. benchmark briefly
entered bear market territory -- considered a 20 percent drop
from its recent peak -- at the session's low on Oct. 4.
 A move to nationalize Franco-Belgian bank Dexia 
also bolstered sentiment, since it was seen as an indication
that governments would step in and keep large lenders from
going under. [ID:nL5E7L90W7]]
 The Dexia rescue showed European governments ""can act
quickly and decisively,"" boosting hopes for real results on
Merkel's and Sarkozy's promises, said Quincy Krosby, market
strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
 ""The market gave Merkel and Sarkozy the benefit of the
doubt. They know they have to come up with specifics,"" Krosby
said.
 Extended short bets in the euro added to the currency's
momentum as traders rushed to exit positions, lifting the
single currency more than 2 percent to a near three-week high.
 The euro, which was on track for its best daily rise since
July 2010, climbed 1.8 percent to $1.3641, paring some of its
earlier gains.
 ""We're seeing risk coming back on and that's helping the
euro,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at
brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Crude oil rose on improved optimism. November Brent crude
futures  settled up $3.07 at $108.95, while U.S.
November crude  rose $2.43 to settle at $85.41.
 Spot gold prices  rose $33.01 to $1,671.60 an ounce.
 The market for U.S. Treasuries was closed in observance of
the Columbus Day holiday.

 NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose the most in 15
months against the dollar on Monday and may extend gains after
Germany and France pledged to deliver a plan to protect banks
and the euro region from its worsening sovereign debt crisis.
 Extended short bets in the euro added to momentum as
traders rushed to exit positions, lifting the currency more
than 2 percent to a near three-week high, well off a nine-month
low of $1.3145 set last week on trading platform EBS.
 The leaders of Germany and France promised after a weekend
meeting to present a plan before a G20 summit in early November
to recapitalize euro zone banks, settle the Greek debt crisis
and accelerate growth in Europe. For more, see [ID:L5E7L90LY]
 ""For now, the markets are rallying on the belief that there
is forward momentum on dealing with the European bank crisis,""
said Andrew Busch, senior currency strategist at BMO Capital
Markets.
 ""To me, this is an exercise in placing funding sand bags
around the global banks to ensure they are not flooded by the
rising river level of a Greek default,"" he said.
 The euro rose 2.2 percent to $1.3668 , after
hitting a session high of $1.36988 on trading platform EBS, the
loftiest level since Sept. 21.
 It was up 1.9 percent versus the yen  to
104.77, after touching 104.99 yen, also the highest in nearly
three weeks.
 Adding to strength in the euro was stronger-than-expected
data on French and Italian output in August, which reduced
fears of sharp economic pullbacks in euro zone's second- and
third-biggest economies. [ID:nL5E7LA1S9]
 ""We're seeing risk coming back on and that's helping the
euro and this rally could go on given the extent of short
positioning in the market,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 U.S. stocks rallied on renewed optimism about the euro
zone, boosting risk appetite and the euro. The 3-month
correlation between the S&P 500 <.SPX> and euro hit an all-time
high, according to Credit Suisse.

 EURO RISKS
 Trading volume was muted due to holidays in Canada and
United States.
 Traders will now focus on voting in Slovakia and Malta to
ratify changes to the European Financial Stability Facility, a
440 billion euro bailout fund. They are the remaining euro zone
countries still to approve the changes. Any delay on passing
the legislation could affect sentiment toward the euro.
 Some analysts said the euro's rebound could also fade if no
comprehensive plan emerges in coming weeks, with the risk of
renewed bickering between euro zone policymakers seen as a
threat to a decision.
 Greece was wrapping up talks with EU and IMF officials on a
vital 8 billion euros worth of aid Athens needs to stave off
immediate bankruptcy, but it expects better terms on a new
bailout deal agreed in July, Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said on Monday. See [ID:nL5E7LA0U4]
 ""At the end of the day Greece still has problems,"" BBH's
Chandler said.
 The euro slipped 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc
 to 1.2326. It had earlier touched a 4-1/2 month
high at 1.24358 francs on EBS on speculation Swiss authorities
could raise the floor on euro/Swiss franc from 1.20 francs.
 The dollar lost 2.7 percent to 0.9021 francs . It
also fell 0.1 percent to 76.63 yen . Against a basket of
currencies, the dollar index <.DXY> declined 1.6 percent.

 NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied for a

to resolve the European debt crisis by the end of the month.

head of international equities at Scottish Widows, which has
145 billion pounds ($227 billion) under management.

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose to its highest in
more than a week versus the dollar on Monday, supported by a
renewed German and French pledge to unveil a comprehensive plan
by the end of the month to rescue the region from a sovereign
debt crisis.	
 However, analysts said the rebound could run out of steam if
no concrete euro zone plan emerges in coming weeks, with the
risk of renewed bickering between euro zone policymakers seen as
a threat to quick decision making. 
 The euro climbed 1.6 percent to $1.3593 , pulling away
from a nine-month low of $1.3145 hit last week on trading
platform EBS, as investors unwound some of their short positions
initiated earlier.	
 The single currency's rise gained steam after it rose past
stops at $1.3510, $1.3525 and above $1.3550, putting it on track
for its best daily performance since the middle of July.	
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy promised after a meeting at the weekend to present a
plan before a G20 summit early next month to shore up euro zone
banks, settle the Greek debt crisis and help growth in
Europe. 
 That gave a boost to risk sentiment and other perceived
riskier currencies like the Australian dollar. 
 The pledge was short of details, but the fact that they
agreed on a deadline for a common crisis response suggested a
major announcement is likely in the next couple of weeks.	
 ""The market has taken these comments at face value but we
are a bit sceptical about interpreting from those remarks they
will be able to come with something before the G20 leaders
summit,"" said Gavin Friend, currency analyst at National
Australia Bank.	
 ""The price action is more about the market playing the euro
from the short side. We have brought the rumour and now need to
see something that is tangible."" 
 Currency speculators increased their bets against the euro
last week, with net short positions at 82,697 contracts.
Analysts said readjustments of these bearish positions could
give the euro some short-term relief. 
 Euro/dollar implied volatilities fell as the spot
recovered, but risk reversals still showed the
bias towards euro downside. The three-month risk reversal was
trading at a fairly elevated level of 3.5 in favour or euro
puts. 
 
 SLOVAKIA VOTE 
 France, Belgium and Luxembourg agreed a rescue plan for
Dexia bank, while other French banks have come under intense
pressure because of their exposure to Greece and other weak euro
zone countries. 
 French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale
denied a report they would seek to raise a combined 11
billion euros as part of a broader European recapitalisation
plan. 
 Despite their denials the threat of contagion and the risk
of a banking crisis remained.	
 Traders will eye voting in Slovakia and Malta to ratify the
changes to the euro zone rescue fund. They are the only two euro
zone countries that still have to approve the changes, and the
vote in Slovakia is finely balanced. Any delay on passing the
legislation could hit sentiment towards the euro.	
 Adding to traders' concerns for the euro, the next aid
tranche for Greece is far from being a done deal. The IMF
indicated Greece is at a crossroads and would need to implement
""much stricter structural reforms"" than seen so far.

 ""Short positions against the euro have been stopped out
which is why the euro has bounced,"" said Adam Myers, senior
currency strategist at Credit Agricole. ""But there are
significant risks for the euro and I will be surprised if it can
move past $1.3650.""	
 The euro rose to a 4-1/2 month high against the Swiss franc
, advancing to 1.2370 francs on EBS, on lingering
speculation that the Swiss authorities could raise the floor on
the euro/Swiss franc from 1.20 francs currently.	
 The Australian dollar was up 1.7 percent at
US$0.9936, while the New Zealand dollar rose 1.6 percent to
US$0.7805 .	
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 76.72 yen
while against the Swiss franc it lost 1.8 percent to trade at
0.9099 francs . All of which left the dollar index
down more than 1 percent on a basket of currencies at 77.804.

 LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro rose on
Monday while top-rated government bonds and the dollar fell
after German and French leaders promised to announce fresh steps
to tackle the euro zone debt crisis by the end of the month.	
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy said after talks in Berlin on Sunday that their goal was
to come up with a sustainable answer for Greece's debt problems
and agree how to recapitalise European banks. 
 But they declined to give any details of their plan, which
left investors wary of buying risky assets aggressively.	
 Investors are also cautious ahead of a key vote by the
Slovakian parliament on Tuesday to ratify changes to the rescue
fund to increase its lending capacity. One dissenting voice
among the 17 countries that use the euro could wreck that plan.	
 ""The market is looking for a road map for a solution to the
euro zone crisis. Merkel and Sarkozy details are scratchy and
investors will need to see the detail by the end of the month,""
said Richard Batty, strategist at Standard Life Investments,
which has $245 billion of assets under management. 
 ""Although it is positive, the issue is how much extra
capital do the banks need. Any bailouts may mean a further hit
to equity holders. We still need to see the extent of potential
losses.""	
 MSCI world equity index rose 0.5 percent,
having posted a second consecutive weekly gain last week. The
benchmark index is more than 7 percent above its 15-month low
set last week.	
 U.S. stock futures gained 1.3 percent , pointing to a
firmer open on Wall Street later.	
 European stocks and emerging stocks both
gained 0.5 percent. 
 China shares closed at their lowest since March 2009
, dragged down by property issues after local media
reported a drop in property sales volumes during the Golden Week
holiday last week. Volume in Shanghai slumped to a 33-month low.	
 U.S. crude oil  rose 1.9 percent to $84.52 a barrel.	
 Bund futures  fell 49 ticks, erasing earlier gains.
Bonds earlier found support from safe-haven flows also
underpinned by downgrades of Italy and Spain's credit ratings on
Friday . Moody's warned it could cut Belgium's
rating . 
 Two-year German bond yields were up 3.1 bps at
0.639 percent, with 10-year yields up 3.5 bps at
2.038 percent. 
 ""Yields can't fall much further while there's hopes they
will pull a rabbit out of the hat, so unless we see news to the
contrary, risk markets should be fairly stable and
flight-to-quality flows into Bunds will be limited, keeping a
floor under yields,"" RIA Capital Markets rate strategist Nick
Stamenkovic said.	
 The dollar lost 1.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies.	
 The euro rose 1.5 percent to $1.3592, pulling further
away from last week's nine-month low around $1.3145.	
 Concrete steps to recapitalise euro zone banks could offer
some relief to the euro, which has been dogged by mounting
worries about the impact of the bloc's debt crisis on the
European banking sector. 
 France, Belgium and Luxembourg agreed a rescue plan early on
Monday for Dexia bank, while other French banks have
come under intense pressure because of their exposure to Greece
and other weak European countries. 
 BNP Paribas and Societe Generale denied
they would seek to raise a combined 11 billion euros as part of
a broader European recapitalisation plan. 
 French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said he did not
think any more banks would need to be rescued after Dexia.

 SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday,
buoyed by a flurry of short-covering after leaders of Germany
and France promised a new comprehensive plan by the end of the
month to recapitalise euro zone banks. 
 The meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy offered no details, but drew a
pledge to do what is necessary to shore up banks, settle the
Greek debt crisis and help growth in Europe, giving a gentle
boost to risk sentiment. .	
 Market players, however, remained cautious given the lack of
details and since EU leaders have promised several times before
to resolve the debt crisis, to no avail.	
 ""The positive response could simply reflect the fact that
positioning is now more balanced following earlier risk
reduction,"" Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citi in
Singapore, said in a research note.	
 ""It looks unlikely that EUR gains can be sustained absent
further positive developments,"" he added.	
 The euro climbed 0.7 percent to $1.3475 , pulling
away from a nine-month low of $1.3145 hit last week on trading
platform EBS. The single currency's rise gained steam after
it breached hourly resistance at $1.3423.	
 Concrete steps to recapitalise euro zone banks
could offer some relief to the euro, which has been dogged by
mounting worries about the impact of the euro zone's debt crisis
on the European banking sector.	
 France, Belgium and Luxembourg agreed early on Monday a
rescue plan for Dexia bank, while other French banks have come
under intense pressure because of their exposure to Greece and
other weak European countries. 
 BNP Paribas and Societe Generale denied
they would seek to raise a combined 11 billion euros as part of
a broader European recapitalisation plan.

 Market liquidity was lower than usual with Japan on
holiday, a factor that may have helped exaggerate the euro's
rise. Market positioning was another contributing factor,
traders said. 
 ""On the open, Sydney ran the sell stops down through
Friday's lows in EUR/USD... So now that those orders are done,
path of least resistance is up I guess,"" said a U.S.-based
trader.	
 A trader for a major Japanese bank in Singapore said
short-covering helped fuel the euro's latest rise. 
 ""When positions accumulate, various things can trigger
this type of short-covering,"" he said, adding that short
positions in the euro had increased on Friday, when Fitch cut
the credit ratings of Italy and Spain. 
 The pledge from Merkel and Sarkozy to come up with fresh
measures to solve the euro zone's debt crisis lent support to
equities and helped nudge the Australian dollar higher.	
 The Aussie dollar rose 0.7 percent to $0.9836 ,
pulling away from a one-year low of $0.9388 hit last week. 
 One risk for the euro and risky assets in general is the
fact that the next aid tranche for Greece is far from being a
done deal with the IMF indicating the nation is at a crossroads
and will need to implement ""much stricter structural reforms""
than seen so far. 
 Athens could run out of cash as soon as mid-November without
the new 8 billion euro aid installment, increasing the risk of a
default that would drag the region deeper into a debt crisis
already shaking financial markets worldwide.	
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 76.74 yen
in light trading with Tokyo players away on holiday.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - European index futures rose on
Monday, following small gains for Asian shares, and the euro
firmed 1 cent after the leaders of France and Germany pledged to
unveil a plan to solve the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis by
the end of the month. 
 Commodities were mostly stronger, helped by optimism on
action in Europe and better-than-expected U.S. jobs data on
Friday that eased fears of renewed recession in the world's
biggest economy.	
 ""The Europeans would now seem to be singing from the same
hymn book and while some form of solution to the crisis is still
a ways off, it now at least seems plausible,"" said Cameron
Peacock, market analyst at IG Markets.	
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  futures rose 1 percent.
Futures for Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40 
also gained around 1 percent, while financial spreadbetters in
London called the FTSE 100 to open up as much as 0.8
percent. 
 
 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.5 percent, while Tokyo markets were
closed for a public holiday.	
 Australian and South Korean shares gained,
but Hong Kong stocks fell 0.3 percent, hit by declines
for financials and some property developers while Shanghai's
main index lost 0.4 percent. 
 Fears of a possible ""hard landing"" in the world's
second-largest economy have roiled Hong Kong and mainland
markets over the past couple of months, hurting banking,
property and resources-related shares the most, although some
players now see a buying opportunity.	
 ""Chinese stocks are pricing in negative earnings growth to
perpetuity,"" Citi analysts said in a note on Monday. ""From these
levels, markets have risen in nine out of ten cycles.
Increasingly, thoughts need to turn towards what to buy rather
than sell.""	
 
 VOLATILE MARKETS	
 European policymakers have been under pressure from volatile
financial markets to get to grips with the euro zone crisis,
which many fear is heading inexorably towards a default by
Greece -- and perhaps others -- that could unleash turmoil in
the banking system.	
 Underlining the urgency of finding a fix, stricken
Franco-Belgian lender Dexia agreed early on Monday the
nationalisation of its Belgian banking division, the first
victim of the two-year-old crisis. 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy said after talks in Berlin on Sunday that their goal was
to come up with a sustainable answer for Greece's woes, agree
how to recapitalise European banks and present a plan for
accelerating economic coordination in the euro zone by a G20
summit in Cannes on Nov. 3-4. 
 The euro rose around 0.8 percent to $1.3475 , from
$1.3375 on Friday, when it had come under pressure following
ratings downgrades of Italy and Spain. 
 The downgrade had also hit U.S. share markets, with the S&P
500 ending Friday down 0.8 percent. S&P 500 futures
 were up 1.1 percent on Monday, pointing to a firmer start
on Wall Street. 
 Despite the euro's gains, many market players remained
cautious about the outlook for the single currency, noting that
Europe's leaders have often fallen short in past attempts to
deal with the debt crisis.	
 ""The positive response could simply reflect the fact that
positioning is now more balanced following earlier risk
reduction,"" Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citi in
Singapore, said in a research note. 
 
 TIGHTENING OF SPREADS	
 Hopes for progress in Europe helped improve sentiment in
credit markets, with a modest tightening of spreads measured by
iTraxx's Asia ex-Japan investment grade corporate index
.	
 Oil firmed, building on Friday's gains on the back of U.S.
payrolls data showing employers added more jobs last month than
analysts expected, which eased fears of renewed recession in the
world's biggest consumer.	
 Brent crude rose 0.2 percent to $106.07 a barrel and U.S.
crude gained 0.6 percent to $83.50. 
 But copper fell 0.8 percent to around $7,310 a tonne, giving
up some of the gains from last week's bounce that saw it post
its biggest weekly gain in six months. 
 Gold, which in recent weeks has switched from a negative to
a positive correlation with riskier assets such as industrial
commodities and stocks as safe haven investors turned instead to
the dollar, rose 0.8 percent to around $1,650 an ounce.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on
Friday, but European and Asian equities markets mostly
finished higher, after several days of gains supported by
assurances that European banks would be recapitalized to help
deal with a potential debt default by Greece.
 After falling on Monday to the worst levels in 13 months,
the three major U.S. stock indexes finished Friday's session
with gains for the week -- helped by encouraging U.S. jobs
data, which prompted some buying late in the day. But those
gains quickly vanished as investors switched focus near the
close to focus on downgrades of the credit ratings of Spain
and Italy.
 ""The employment data was viewed as being relatively good,
but this issue in Europe keeps rearing its head. We just can't
seem to escape Europe's debt crisis,"" said Thomas Villalta,
portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Asset Management in
Austin, Texas.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended Friday down
just 20.21 points, or 0.18 percent, at 11,103.12. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 9.51 points, or 0.82 percent,
at 1,155.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 27.47
points, or 1.10 percent, at 2,479.35.
 For the week, though, the Dow gained 1.7 percent, the S&P
500 rose 2.1 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.7 percent.
 Helping the U.S. jobs picture, the U.S. Labor Department
said on Friday that employers added more jobs than analysts
expected last month. Non-farm payrolls data for July and
August also were revised upward. [ID:nOAT004877]
 While the U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 9.1
percent, the government report supported other data that have
eased fears the U.S. economy was heading into another
recession.
 European shares rose to a five-week closing high, with the
pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top shares up
0.7 percent at 947.63 -- up 2.6 percent for the week.
 This week, European leaders showed more determination to
fix problem banks, with the European Central Bank offering
more help to struggling European banks through the purchase of
covered bonds and with a renewed offer of longer-term loans to
ward off a new credit crunch. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L616W]
 Worries about the euro zone's debt crisis have hit the
market hard in recent months, along with concern about
stalling economic growth in the United States and China.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World index
<.MIWD00000PUS> ended the day up 0.46 percent at 285.68 and
rose more than 1 percent for the week.
 EURO SLIPS, BONDS SLIDE
 The credit rating downgrades for Italy and Spain knocked
the wind out of the euro on Friday. Traders said anxiety about
Europe's economy and fragile banks will likely continue to
hobble it in the weeks ahead.
 The euro slipped 0.3 percent to $1.3388  but was up
slightly for the week -- for the first time in three weeks.
 The U.S. dollar ended up against the yen at 76.85 yen
 and up against the Swiss franc at 0.9258 .
 The euro may get a boost if euro-zone leaders can cobble
together a plan on Sunday to recapitalize banks facing hefty
losses. [ID:nL5E7L714R]
 But Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Mark McCormick said
the prospect of a euro-zone recession and an interest-rate cut
were gaining traction after the ECB this week unveiled new
funding plans to stabilize banks and the euro-zone economy.
 ""That means the euro probably doesn't get much momentum
even on good news,"" he said. ""A euro-zone recession is still
possible and the ECB probably cuts rates before 2012.""
 The prices of U.S. Treasury securities fell on Friday, as
the better-than-expected job growth in September dampened the
case for more Federal Reserve intervention.
""This is clearly a vote for the slow growth camp rather
than the recession camp, so there is small upward pressure on
rates,"" said Leslie Barbi, head of fixed income at RS
Investments in New York, which manages $30 billion in bonds.
 The benchmark 10-year note  fell 23/32 points
to yield 2.07 percent, up from 1.99 percent at Thursday's
close. The 30-year Treasury bond  tumbled 1-14/32
in price for a yield of 3.01 percent, up from 2.94 percent
late Thursday.
 For the week, benchmark U.S. yields saw their biggest rise
in three months. Ten-year yields moved back above 2.0 percent,
and 30-year yields returned to 3 percent from historic lows.
 The U.S. bond market will be closed on Monday for the U.S.
Columbus Day holiday.
 In Europe, German government bond prices also fell on
Friday though safe-haven bids could return next week if euro-
zone leaders fail to produce the plans for banking
recapitalizations that markets are anticipating. Ten-year
German yields  rose above 2.0 percent to hit 2.03
percent.
 Crude oil prices edged higher on Friday after the
encouraging U.S. jobs data suggested the United States may
avoid a recession. U.S. November crude  rose 39 cents to
close at $82.98 a barrel, while Brent crude for November
 edged up 15 cents to settle at $105.88 a barrel.
 Gold prices fell around 1.0 percent on Friday, as bullion
investors raised cash to cover margin calls amid losses in the
other markets. Gold still recorded its first weekly gain in a
month, closing around $1,636.00 an ounce.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped while
global stocks rose late on Friday after downgrades of Spain's
and Italy's credit ratings overshadowed better-than-expected
U.S. employment data.
 The credit rating downgrades came ahead of a European
summit on Sunday aimed at shoring up the region's financial
sector. For more, see: [ID:nL5E7L714R]
 Earlier on Friday, U.S. and European stocks had gained
after better-than-expected U.S. employment data eased fears of
another recession. [ID:nOAT004877].
 ""The employment data was viewed as being relatively good

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slipped 5.75

500 Index <.SPX> was down 8.00 points, or 0.69 percent, at
1,156.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 21.14
points, or 0.84 percent, at 2,485.68.
 U.S. stocks are still set to end the week higher though,
with the S&P 500 on track for a gain of about 2.0 percent.
 European shares rose to a five-week closing high, with the
pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top shares up
0.7 percent at 946.98, up 2.6 percent for the week after
European leaders committed to recapitalizing the region's banks
earlier this week.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World index
<.MIWD00000PUS> were up 0.2 percent at 285.04.
 EURO SLIPS, BONDS DOWN
 The euro fell against the U.S. dollar, snapping a four-day
advance after ratings agency Fitch cut Spain's credit rating
just minutes after downgrading Italy, saying the euro zone debt
crisis has implications for the entire region.
 Fitch cut Spain to AA-minus from AA-plus and kept a
negative outlook on the new rating in a sign more downgrades
are possible in the next couple of years. [ID:nWNA0352]
 Earlier it cut Italy's sovereign credit rating one notch to
A+ from AA-, saying the move reflected the worsening of the
euro zone's debt crisis and an erosion of market confidence,
caused by the government's initially hesitant response to the
rise in its bond yields. [ID:nWNA0347]
 The euro had been up across the board before the downgrades
after data showed U.S. employment grew more than expected in
September, raising optimism about economic recovery.
 But those gains quickly reversed as investors' focus swung
back to euro zone sovereign debt problems and the stresses in
the European banking sector.
 ""This brings the sovereign debt crisis back into focus and
raises the risk for contagion, given Spain has been downgraded
alongside Italy,"" said David Song, currency analyst at DailyFX
in New York.
 The euro was last down 0.3 percent at $1.3403  on
electronic trading platform EBS, still off a nine-month low of
$1.3145 touched on Tuesday but well off the session peak of
$1.3525.
 U.S. Treasuries prices were lower after the strong U.S.
payrolls data reduced fears of a recession but were not enough
to dispel the view that Europe's debt turmoil would exacerbate
already sluggish growth.
 Benchmark yields were on track for their biggest weekly
rise in three months, but were not far above historic lows due
to the stampede into U.S. government debt last quarter after
the downgraded U.S. economic outlook and worries about Europe.
 Prices on 30-year Treasury bonds  were down a
point, yielding 2.99 percent.
 Earlier this week, the 30-year yield touched 2.69 percent,
its lowest level since January 2009.
 Benchmark 10-year notes  fell 14/32 point to
yield 2.04 percent. The 10-year yield is poised for its biggest
weekly rise since early July, when it jumped 31 basis points.
 Oil prices were also lower after the downgrades of Spain
and Italy revived concerns about European economic growth.
 Brent crude oil for November  fell 50 cents to
$105.23 a barrel. U.S. November crude  fell 62 cents to
$81.97 a barrel.
 Gold prices fell more than 1.0 percent as investors quickly
sold to raise cash to cover margin calls in the lower equity
markets after the downgrades of Spain and Italy.
 Gold  fell 1.1 percent to $1,631.69 an ounce.

 ""This brings the sovereign debt crisis back into focus and

in New York.
 ""There will be continued reliance on the ECB to do more
when the (euro zone) is already struggling to pass a second
bailout for Greece. As they try to gain time, things are
getting worse.""
 The euro was last down 0.3 percent at $1.3403  on
electronic trading platform EBS, still off a nine-month low of
$1.3145 touched on Tuesday but well off the session peak of
$1.3525.
 Song said euro/dollar could fall to $1.30 in coming days.
 Traders had earlier said the euro was still a sell on
rallies with a good deal of scepticism over the euro zone's
ability to pull together a swift response to the sovereign debt
and banking crises.
 The ECB stopped short of cutting rates on Thursday as some
had speculated but announced other measures to stabilize the
banking sector and euro zone economy.
 Morgan Stanley said it had changed its short-term strategy
and planned to buy pro-cyclical currencies like the Australian
dollar and the euro over the next few days to take advantage of
the corrective rebound.
 In a note, its analysts argued that short positions in the
euro were at an extreme and there was potential for a
correction, although they remain bearish in the medium term.
 UK BANKS DOWNGRADE
 Sterling was in the spotlight, gaining against the dollar
and the euro with currency investors largely ignoring a Moody's
downgrade of some large UK banks [ID:nWLA6879]. The ratings cut
came a day after the Bank of England announced more
quantitative easing.
 Sterling rose 0.9 percent to $1.5570 , according to
Reuters data, having dived to its lowest in 14-1/2 months
against the dollar at $1.5270 on Thursday after the BoE move.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $0.9772 ,
on Reuters data, still close to a session high of $0.9879.
 The dollar rose 0.05 percent to 76.757 yen  on EBS
with the session peak at 76.93 yen.
 The yen barely moved after Bank of Japan kept monetary
policy on hold. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the yen's rise
was having a huge impact on the economy, keeping alive the risk
of solo intervention by the Japanese [ID:nT9E7KM01E].
 Earlier, as the U.S. session began, risk tolerance had
climbed sharply after data showed U.S. employment grew more
than expected in September, raising optimism about the U.S.
economic recovery. [ID:nOAT004877]
 But while the U.S. jobs report was widely welcomed by
investors, analysts still expressed caution and it was not
enough to offset the later negative news from Europe.
 ""This removes some of the concern that the labor market is
getting worse,"" said John Doyle, currency strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington. ""But overall, this still isn't that
many jobs, so while it's better than it could be, it's not
great.""

 NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro were
higher midsession on Friday after stronger-than-expected U.S.
employment data eased fears of another global recession.
 The U.S. Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by
103,000, above expectations for a 60,000 rise. Jobs gains for
prior months were also revised higher. For details, see

 But U.S. stocks lost some ground late morning as investors
continued to worry about the impact of a possible debt default

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
rallied on Friday after stronger-than-expected U.S. employment
data eased fears of another global recession.
 Hopes for a stronger policy response to the euro zone debt
crisis also supported the European single currency, which rose
against the dollar for the fourth consecutive session.
 Prices of U.S. government bonds slid after the U.S. Labor
Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by 103,000, above
expectations for a 60,000 rise. Jobs gains for prior months
were also revised higher. For details, see [ID:nOAT004877].
 ""It's a breath of fresh air and should allow the risk
recovery we've had this week to continue,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief strategist at Forex.com in New Jersey.
 ""All in all, it suggests a continuation of the risk
recovery and that the U.S. will outperform other developed
economies,"" he added.

 * Euro flat, investors wary of big bets ahead of U.S. jobs
report
 * ECB steps, expectations of bank recapitalisation support
euro
 * Moody's downgrades UK banks but sterling/dollar firm

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The euro paused in its climb
against the dollar on Friday as investors were hesitant to add
to the single currency's upside before U.S. jobs data, following
its rally after the European Central Bank provided liquidity to
struggling euro zone banks. 
 Traders said the euro was still a sell on rallies with a
good deal of scepticism over the bloc's ability to pull together
a swift response to the sovereign debt and banking crisis.	
 ""Some of the euro/dollar shorts have been squeezed as the
market seems to be taking the positive aspects from the ECB
measures and hopes of recapitalisation of European banks,"" said
Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS Global Banking.	
 ""Going into the U.S. jobs data, a very weak number could see
the euro drop while a consensus to marginally weak number could
help.""	
 September's U.S. payrolls report, due at 1230 GMT, is
expected to show 60,000 new jobs created and the unemployment
rate unchanged at 9.1 percent. The numbers will be scoured for
signals on whether the U.S. economy is headed for recession.	
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	
 Graphic on U.S. payrolls http://link.reuters.com/qen34s	
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	
 The euro was flat on the day at $1.3425 , well off a
nine-month low of $1.3145 on Tuesday and on track for its first
weekly gain in three. 
 It rose 0.6 percent on Thursday after the ECB announced new
12- and 13-month lending operations as well as a plan to buy 40
billion euros of covered bonds, which will probably tide banks
over through 2012.	
 The single currency rose as high as $1.3464, but gains were
capped by stop-loss orders cited above $1.3470 and $1.35.	
 Traders say a hefty $2 billion in $1.3400 options are set to
expire later in the day, along with $1 billion at $1.3500, which
may keep the euro hemmed in between those levels.	
 Though the ECB stopped short of cutting rates as some had
speculated, the measures were enough to lift stocks and
commodities as risk appetite showed some signs of stabilising.	
 Indeed, Morgan Stanley said it had changed its short-term
strategy and planned to buy pro-cyclical currencies like the
Australian dollar and the euro over the next few days to take
advantage of the corrective rebound.	
 In a note, its analysts argued that short positions in the
euro were at an extreme and there was potential for a
correction, although they remain bearish in the medium term. 
 Any correction may prove temporary as many players doubt
that a pan-European policy action on banks will come quickly,
given the euro zone's history of struggle in gaining a consensus
among member states.	
 The options market shows implied volatility for euro/dollar
has slipped in the past week, suggesting investors had priced in
more volatility stemming from euro zone risks than the U.S.
payrolls data.	
 One-month implied vol slipped to around 15.5
percent from around 16 percent the previous day.	
 Meanwhile, one-month 25-delta risk reversals, which gauges
the skew between bets to buy or sell the euro, were unchanged at
levels which indicate the market remains tilted towards more
euro weakness.	
 
 UK BANKS DOWNGRADE	
 Analysts were cautious about whether a positive payrolls
surprise could provide lasting support to risky assets.	
 In an environment where more banks are cutting global growth
forecasts and some even expect a fresh recession, the safe-haven
dollar and the yen would be preferred.	
 ""It will take a really negative payrolls data for the
risk-off trade to return,"" said Geoff Kendrick, currency
strategist at Nomura. ""Market pricing of a financial Armageddon
has been pared back after yesterday's ECB measures, but
structurally the euro could still head back towards multi-month
lows.""	
 Sterling was in the spotlight, gaining against the dollar
and the euro with currency investors largely ignoring a Moody's
downgrade of some large UK banks. The ratings cut
came a day after the Bank of England announced more quantitative
easing.	
 Sterling rose 0.5 percent to $1.5505 , having dived
to its lowest level in 14 months against the dollar at $1.5270
on Thursday after the BoE decision.	
 The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $0.9774 ,
pulling back from a session high as European shares pared
earlier gains. 
 The dollar was flat at 76.66 yen while the euro was
marginally softer at 102.95 yen . The yen barely moved
after Bank of Japan kept monetary policy on hold.	
 Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the yen's rise was having a
huge impact on the economy, keeping alive the risk of solo
intervention by the Japanese. .

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The euro clung to its gains of the
past three sessions on Friday, helped by short-covering after
the European Central Bank took steps to keep banks afloat and on
hopes of more policy measures to boost their capital.	
 Still, entrenched scepticism over the euro zone's ability to
pull together a timely response to the debt and banking crisis
kept many players ready to sell the euro into rallies.	
 Japanese exporters have been steadily shedding the euro this
week, including on Friday, keeping the currency in check, while
commodity currencies gained slightly on the back of easing fears
over the euro zone's debt malaise.	
 ""The euro still seems to be in a downward sloping tunnel.
Inside this tunnel, people are trying to grope their way along
and occasionally they may go up but the tunnel itself is still
sloping down,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, manager of forex at State
Street.	
 The common currency stood at $1.3432 , flat from late
U.S. levels, staying well above a nine-month low of $1.3145 hit
on Tuesday. 
 It gained 0.6 percent on Thursday after the ECB announced
new 12- and 13-month lending operations as well as a plan to buy
40 billion euros of covered bonds, which will likely tide banks
over through all of 2012. 
 Though the ECB stopped short of cutting rates as some had
speculated, the measures were enough to boost battered share
prices and propel copper to its biggest one-day gain in 20
months.	
 For now, the euro looks set to retest $1.3448, the 38.2
retracement of its sharp fall since mid-September. A break above
that would target its 21-day moving average at $1.3575. 
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on
Thursday the EU's executive arm would present a plan for member
states to coordinate a recapitalization of their banks.

 But many players doubt that policy action on banks will come
quickly, given the euro zone's history of trouble in gaining a
consensus among member countries, and they think the
short-covering rally in the euro could run out of gas soon.	
 Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney, said markets have
probably seen the best of the risk rally as they start to think
about what's coming next. 
""There are still plenty of problems that face the European
financial system ... The risk rally will probably run out of
steam in the next week.""	
 Taking a contrarian view, Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, said the euro could extend gains
to around $1.37 next week on hopes that European policy makers
will come up with more anti-crisis measures by the G20 finance
ministers' meeting on Oct. 14-15. 
 Investors are now focusing on Friday's U.S. non-farm
payrolls report for September, which is expected to show 60,000
new jobs created and the unemployment rate unchanged at 9.1
percent.	
 Still, given concern over the health of the European and
global financial system, the data may have little impact on
market sentiment if job growth comes in somewhere between zero
and 100,000, a Japanese bank trader said. 
 
 CHINA FRICTION 
 Some traders were also wary that friction between the United
States and China could heighten next week as U.S. President
Barack Obama accused China of ""gaming"" international trade even
though he did not clarify whether he supported a bill before the
U.S. Senate aimed at pressing China to revalue the yuan. The
bill will head for a final vote on Tuesday. 
 ""When trade tensions rise when there are growing concerns
over the Chinese economy, that could hurt Chinese exports and
make financial markets even more unstable,"" the Japanese bank
trader said.	
 Sterling stood at $1.5437 , flat on the day. It
dived to its lowest level in 14 months against the dollar at
$1.5270 after the Bank of England announced more quantitative
easing.	
 The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $0.9773
on the back of easing in fears about the debt crisis.	
 The dollar moved little against the yen at 76.61 yen
but the euro was softer versus the yen at 102.90 yen, down 0.1
percent, on Japanese exporter selling.	
 The Bank of Japan kept policy on hold at its two-day policy
meeting that ended on Friday.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - European stock index futures
rose on Friday, following a bounce in Asian shares, and the euro
clung to gains from a 2-cent rally after euro zone policymakers
moved to shore up struggling banks and fend off a financial
crisis.	
 The European Central Bank (ECB) announced aggressive
liquidity measures on Thursday, throwing a lifeline to lenders
who have seen wholesale funding drying up as market confidence
ebbed, and the European Union said it would present a plan for a
coordinated recapitalisation of banks by member states.	
 Gold, oil, copper and equities were all on course to post
weekly gains on hopes that Europe's leaders may finally be
getting to grips with a two-year-old sovereign debt crisis,
although the scale of the task meant caution remained high.	
 ""There are still plenty of problems that face the European
financial system,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney.
""The risk rally will probably run out to steam in the next
week.""	
 Asian credit indexes tightened as share markets climbed and
regional interest rate swap curves were mostly higher, tracking
a fall in U.S. Treasuries in the previous session.	
 Fears that the European crisis is heading inexorably towards
a default by Greece -- and possibly others -- that could trigger
turmoil in the banking system have caused a sharp sell-off in
riskier assets since late July.	
 
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  futures rose 0.4
percent on Friday. Futures for Germany's DAX  and
France's CAC-40  were also firmer, while financial
spreadbetters called the FTSE 100 to open up as much as
0.6 percent. 
 Tokyo's Nikkei share average rose 1 percent, while
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
climbed 2.9 percent, led by a 4.4 percent gain
from the materials sector . 
 U.S. stocks rose more that 1.5 percent on
Thursday, as global stocks posted their third straight day of
gains. 
 S&P 500 index futures  traded in Asia were mildly
negative, indicating some caution ahead of the non-farm payrolls
report later, a weekly jobs gauge that is always closely watched
for clues on the state of the U.S. economy.	
 ""No one wants to take a big position ahead of the U.S. jobs
report later in case there is a downside surprise,"" said Koichi
Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo.	
 Asian emerging markets have been punished hard in the market
slide of recent months, with MSCI's Asia ex-Japan index falling
more than 25 percent from its April high for the year, partly
due to foreign fund managers taking money out of markets that
had been outperforming to cover losses elsewhere.	
 Citigroup analysts said in a note that outflows from
emerging market equity funds, which often set the overall market
direction, had accelerated in the week to Oct. 5, with a net
$1.3 billion pulled from Asia.	
 
 RETURN OF RISK	
 The European Central Bank said on Thursday it was ready to
buy bonds to provide longer-term cheap money for European
lenders in need of funding. 
 And, in a further boost, European Commission President
Manuel Barroso said the EU's executive arm was proposing
coordinated action to cleanse banks of toxic assets, the most
explicit statement yet from a top European official on joint
action to help restore battered confidence in the sector.	
 The euro, which has fallen back from a 2011 peak near $1.50
in May, was steady around $1.3433 , after jumping from a
low of $1.3240 on Thursday. 
 Many market players put the euros rally down to
short-covering -- when traders buy back into a currency to
realise gains on an earlier bet it would fall -- and believe the
single currency's downtrend remains intact.	
 ""The euro still seems to be in a downward sloping tunnel,""
said Kimihiko Tomita, manager of forex at State Street in Tokyo.
""Inside this tunnel, people are trying to grope their way along
and occasionally they may go up but the tunnel itself is still
sloping down."" 
 While some investors were disappointed the ECB did not also
cut interest rates, riskier assets such as equities, commodities
and currencies linked to commodity markets, such as the
Australian dollar, rallied.	
 Copper rose around 1.3 percent on Friday, extending
a gain of nearly 6 percent in the previous session. Copper has
risen nearly 4 percent this week, after tumbling 23 percent in
the previous four weeks.	
 Gold rose 0.6 percent to around $1,659 an ounce, on
course for its first week of gains after four straight weeks of
declines that saw it shift from a negative to a positive
correlation with riskier assets as investors seeking safety
turned instead to U.S. Treasuries and the dollar.	
 Brent crude  was flat around $105.67 a barrel and
U.S. crude  was also little changed at $82.60, on course
for its biggest weekly gain in seven months. 
 As some confidence returned, credit markets tightened, with
spreads measured by iTraxx's Asia ex-Japan investment grade
corporate index coming in about 20 basis points,
after a sharp widening at the start of the week.	
 Japanese government bonds eased, with the benchmark 10-year
yield rising 1.5 basis points to 0.985 percent.

 ""If the U.S. jobs report shows strong figures, we may see
more unwinding,"" said a fund manager at a Japanese asset
management firm. ""But a sharp correction in JGB prices is
unlikely as investors' concerns are centred on the euro zone
debt crisis, which will not be resolved easily.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied for a
third straight day and oil prices surged on Thursday on renewed
European efforts to aid ailing regional banks and as a ho-hum
U.S. jobs report still managed to ease fears of a new
recession.
 The European Central Bank threw a lifeline to struggling
European banks with a renewed offer of longer-term loans to
ward off a new credit crunch and the European Union readied a
plan to recapitalize banks. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L6311]
 European stocks jumped and Wall Street rallied further from
recent losses that had driven stocks into bear market territory
on Tuesday as investors took heart that officials in Europe are
finally coming to grips with the simmering debt crisis.
 Investors have swung from euphoria to despair on headlines
from Europe, which has translated into high volatility and a
market that is directionless, said Doug Roberts, chief
investment strategist of Channel Capital Research.
 ""We're popping back up again, based on the idea they will
reach an agreement and rescue us,"" Roberts said.
 The euro rallied for a third day against the dollar, and
government debt prices on both sides of the Atlantic slid after
the ECB's actions eased fears the region's recovering economies
would slump back into recession.
 The euro  gained 0.6 percent at $1.3433, and European
shares closed up more than 2 percent. Equity markets in London
gained more than 3 percent after the Bank of England moved to
spur a sluggish UK economy by enlarging a stimulus program.
 Jean-Claude Trichet, in his final news conference as
president of the ECB, said the bank's governing council decided
to launch a covered-bond purchase program by spending 40
billion euros over a 12-month period from November. Covered
bonds are backed by assets such as mortgages and public sector
bonds and are perceived as safe and high-quality assets.

 ""The abundance of liquidity measures announced shows the
ECB's resolve to boost liquidity, and that is quite
satisfactory to the market, easing tensions in the financial
and banking sectors,"" said Kathy Lien, director of FX research
at GFT in Jersey City, New Jersey.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 183.38
points, or 1.68 percent, at 11,123.33. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 20.94 points, or 1.83 percent, at
1,164.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 46.31
points, or 1.88 percent, at 2,506.82.
 The FTSE 100 <.FTSE> in London climbed 3.7 percent to
5,291.26, and the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
European shares rose 2.6 percent to close at 940.65.
 Reaction to the death of Apple  co-founder Steve
Jobs was muted as the company's shares slipped 0.2 percent.

 The euro rose, but few market participants believe the new
ECB measures will be sufficient to resolve the debt crisis.
Most remained bearish on the euro for the rest of the year.
 ""We believe liquidity (measures) and, eventually, policy
rate easing, are likely to remain a negative for the euro in
the coming months and maintain a bias to sell rallies,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo
in New York.
 Oil prices surged on the developments in Europe and on U.S.
data that showed new claims for jobless benefits rose less than
expected last week, hinting at an improved labor market a day
before the government's closely watched monthly non-farm
payrolls report for September. [ID:nN1E7950UR]
 ""The markets are looking to embrace even the slightest
improvement in the economy,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at
hedge fund Again Capital in New York.
 Brent crude futures for November  rose $3.00 to
settle at $105.73 a barrel, and U.S. crude  gained $2.91
to settle at $82.59 a barrel.
 The U.S. Treasuries market slumped as the ECB moves and the
U.S. jobs data reduced the safe-haven bids for bonds.

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  fell
29/32 in price to yield 1.99 percent.

rally in equities and commodities.

 NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The euro climbed against the
dollar for a third straight session on Thursday after the
European Central Bank held rates steady, as expected, but
announced new liquidity measures to support the region's ailing
banks.
 Few market participants, however, were convinced these new
measures would be sufficient to resolve the debt crisis and
most remained bearish on the euro for the rest of the year.
 ""We believe liquidity (measures) and, eventually, policy
rate easing, are likely to remain a negative for the euro in
the coming months and maintain a bias to sell rallies,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo
in New York.
 ""From a broader perspective, today's central bank moves
could be seen as the first steps towards restoring broader
market confidence, but more is likely needed before risk
appetite makes a comeback,"" he added.
 Jean-Claude Trichet, in his final press conference as ECB
president, said the bank's Governing Council decided to launch
a new covered bond purchase program totaling 40 billion euros.
Covered bonds are backed by assets such as mortgages and public
sector loans and perceived as safe and high-quality. Buying
them could encourage further lending. For details, see
[ID:nECBNEWS]
 The ECB, which kept interest rates on hold at 1.5 percent,
also threw another lifeline to commercial banks by renewing
offers to lend them one-year funding in two operations, this
month and in December. [ID:nL5E7L61YG]
 In mid-afternoon trading, the euro  was up 0.6
percent against the dollar at $1.34280, just off the session
high at $1.34500, but well off a low of $1.32415 seen on
trading platform EBS.
 Despite a pick-up in the euro, fund managers remained
bearish on the currency. And even though Greece has been
temporarily relegated to the background until the International
Monetary Fund, European Union, and ECB file their report on the
country later this month, some are pricing in a default.
 STILL NO SOLUTION TO DEBT CRISIS
 ""We are very cautious on the euro. A European solution to
the debt crisis would be hard to come by. Ultimately a default
by Greece in some form would be inevitable,"" said James
Harries, fund manager at London-based Newton Capital. Harries
helps oversees assets of about $11 billion.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.4 percent to 102.90 yen
, and gained 0.4 percent versus the Swiss franc to
1.23690 francs , and rose 0.9 percent against the
pound to 87.02 pence .
 Optimism that Germany was moving to safeguard the financial
sector and modestly improved U.S. economic data increased risk
appetite and provided support for the euro after a volatile
week in which the French and Belgian governments pledged to
rescue troubled bank Dexia . [ID:nL5E7L513F]
 Analysts said near-term risks for the euro remained high,
although some saw a fall below $1.30 as a good buying
opportunity, given that policymakers working toward a solution
to the debt crisis would boost the euro.
 In other currencies, sterling  fell to its lowest
in 14 months against the dollar at $1.5270 after the Bank of
England's monetary policy committee voted to buy 75 billion
pounds more in assets to support the flagging British economy.
[ID:nL5E7L627B]
 Investors are now focusing on Friday's U.S. non-farm
payrolls report for September, which is expected to show 60,000
new jobs created and an unemployment rate of 9.1 percent.
 ""While it is clear from the economic data that the U.S. is
growing much below its capacity, we expect tomorrow's payroll
report would likely exceed estimates,"" said Brown Brothers
Harriman in a note, suggesting the U.S. economy remained on a
growth path.
 There's much optimism in the fact that U.S. private sector
employers added 91,000 jobs last month, based on the ADP survey
released on Wednesday. And while the ADP report is hardly a
reliable indicator of overall U.S. non-farm jobs, its results
were more in line with the improvement in the employment
component of the Institute for Supply Management surveys.
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent against the yen to 76.630

 LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - World stocks kept a firmer tone on
Thursday after the Bank of England surprised the market by
launching a fresh round of monetary easing this month, before
cutting gains as the European Central Bank left interest rates
on hold.	
 The euro hit the day's low and German government bonds rose
after the ECB held interest rates at 1.5 percent, disappointing
some who had expected a cut in borrowing costs this month.	
 Such expectations grew after the Bank of England pledged to
buy a a bigger-than-expected 75 billion pounds in assets to
bolster the UK economy -- a move that pushed
sterling to a 14-month low against the dollar.	
 Investors are now focusing on ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet's news conference at 1230 GMT -- his last, and at which
he is expected to announce a set of fresh liquidity measures to
help banks.	
 Growing hopes that policymakers would take coordinated steps
to support European banks, under threat from the impact of a
possible Greek debt default, kept the underlying tone positive
for risky assets.	
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso proposed a
coordinated recapitalisation of banks to restore confidence,
while the European Banking Authority said it was examining the
resilience of lenders' capital positions .	
 Optimism over near-term policy measures -- both from
politicians and central banks -- are helping investors to take a
break from a sell-off triggered by growing concerns about the
damage to the banks from any Greek sovereign default.	
 ""It's a good injection of capital. We now just need to see a
coordinated effort from the rest of Europe to sort out the
recapitalisation of European banks and it should form a decent
base to move forward,"" said IG Index sales trader Yusuf Heusen.	
 ""It takes away quite lot of risk. This is positive for the
market.""
 The MSCI world equity index rose 1 percent,
off the day's highs, having hit a 15-month low earlier this
week. The index is now around 6 percent above that point.	
 U.S. stock futures were up 0.1 percent , pointing to a
slightly higher open on Wall Street.	
 European stocks rose 1 percent and emerging stocks
added 2.6 percent.	
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies. The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.3264.	
 ""The ECB is now likely to prepare an interest rate cut
within the next four months, by March at the latest,"" said
Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding. 
 Sterling hit a 14-month low of $1.5270 after the BoE
announcement.	
 Bund futures  erased earlier losses to rise 17 ticks
on the day.	
 The cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against
default fell earlier. Five-year credit default swaps on Italian
government debt fell 18 basis points to 450 bps, according to
data monitor Markit. 
 Equivalent CDS prices fell for Spain, Portugal and Belgium. 
 U.S. crude oil  gained 0.7 percent to $80.28 a barrel.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The euro held steady against the
dollar on Thursday as uncertainty gripped markets before an ECB
meeting that could see rates cut or the rebirth of long-term
lending to banks, while Europe's efforts to resolve its debt
crisis and solid U.S. data provided tentative support for
riskier assets.	
 The euro, last at $1.3331 , maintained most of its
overnight gains made after Germany said it would help its own
banks if necessary and opened the possibility of using a
regional bailout fund to strengthen the euro zone banking
system. 
 Investor focus now shifts squarely to the European Central
Bank's monetary policy meeting, whose outcome -- due at 1145 GMT
-- seems increasingly uncertain.	
 The ECB has been widely expected to keep rates unchanged at
1.5 percent, but calls for a cut have grown louder amid signs
the euro zone economy is deteriorating further and as Greek
default fears weigh heavily on confidence in the bloc's
banks. 
 ""Inflation fears may not allow the ECB to cut rates, but
we're bound to see some form of support for Europe's banking
system -- and that should help the euro rise,"" said Katsunori
Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.	
 Kitakura cited measures such as more liquidity, bringing
back the ECB's 12-month tender last used at the end of 2009,
and, possibly, the resurrection of its programme for buying
covered bonds.	
 In a Reuters survey taken last week, 56 out of 75 economists
said they expected the ECB to hold rates this time around,
though 13 saw a 25 basis-point cut and 7 predicted a 50
basis-point cut.	
 JP Morgan Chase is forecasting a drastic 50 basis point cut
by the ECB saying the bank's move to ""balanced"" inflation risk
at the last meeting came sooner than expected especially since
the ""inflation hump"" is far from over.	
 ""Because the market remains split in its views on what the
ECB should do, it's hard to say to what extent any move is
already priced in the euro,"" said a trader for a Japanese bank.	
 He added that if there is no cut, but additional measures
like more liquidity are implemented, the euro could jump to take
out stop losses looming between $1.3400 and $1.3450.	
 A decisive break above that level could pave the way for a
correction towards $1.3680 -- the 38.2 percent retracement of
the $1.4550-$1.3145 slide.	
 The single currency has lost about 10 percent against the
dollar since that late August peak at $1.4550, but stands
well-off a nine-month trough of $1.3145 struck this week.	
 
 WAITING FOR SOLUTION	
 European finance ministers agreed to safeguard banks, many
of which could face heavy losses if a planned second bailout
package for Greece does not go ahead, after France and Belgium
agreed to bail out the debt crisis' first banking casualty,
Dexia . 
 The countries are expecting to finalise the rescue of the
troubled lender, but disagreements remain over details of the
plan as the two countries try to defend their respective
national interests. 
 ""The crisis is far from over and I'm still negative on the
euro looking beyond the ECB,"" said Minori Uchida, senior analyst
at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding that the currency
may eventually drift below $1.30 in the coming days.	
 The Netherlands votes on widening the role of the EFSF euro
zone bailout fund, as agreed in July, after Malta delayed its
ratification of the facility, while Slovakia -- the last country
to vote on the issue next week -- is bitterly divided over
it. 
 ""They are voting over it, but these measures are already
seen as not satisfactory and the wholistic structural solution
is still far away,"" said Uchida.	
 The British pound shed 0.3 percent to $1.5425 as
the Bank of England was due to meet on Thursday amid talk it may
open the way for more quantitative easing.	
 The single currency hovered around 1.2318 Swiss francs
, having hit its highest since May on Wednesday.	
 With markets highly concerned about the threat of a systemic
shock in Europe, they barely took notice of another round of
better-than-expected U.S. data showing the economy is still
growing, albeit slowly. 
 The recent flow of data suggests fears of recession in the
U.S. and a hard landing in China are possibly overdone. A good
number from Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls could set the stage
for a rally in risk assets.	
 The dollar index came off a nine-month high of 79.838
earlier in the week to last trade at 79.028. It was steady
against the yen at 76.74 , off a three-week peak of 77.26
struck on Monday.

 By Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - European stock index futures rose
on Thursday, after short-covering and value-hunting lifted Asian
shares on optimism that euro zone leaders are acting to aid the
bloc's financial sector and U.S. data suggesting the economy
could avoid recession.	
 An easing of risk aversion, after an intensive sell-off
earlier this week on fears that Europe's debt problems could
trigger a new global financial crisis, helped boost commodities
and saw Asian credit markets tighten sharply.	
 ""The U.S. data supported a view that despite the recent
deterioration in sentiment, the financial turmoil so far has not
had a serious material damage to the economy, at least in the
United States,"" said Hiroki Shimazu, senior market economist at
SMBC Nikko Securities.	
 ""Shares are being bought back as the recent sell-off had
brought the market to levels reflecting a recession, and a sharp
loss in corporate profits, which is now seen as overdone.""	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 3.3 percent, recouping more than half the
steep losses made this week and moving away from a two-year low
hit on Tuesday.	
 
 The Nikkei share average rose 1.7 percent, snapping
a four-day losing streak in a short-covering rally -- when
investors realise gains by buying back borrowed stock they had
previously sold in a bet on falling prices -- with commodity-
and tech-sector shares in demand. 
 Hong Kong shares also rose from oversold conditions as
investors covered short positions, propelling strong gains in
several China-related names that have been among the most
heavily shorted in the last few sessions. The Hang Seng Index
jumped 4.7 percent.	
 But a disappointing start for China's largest listed
brokerage Citic Securities, which fell as much as 10 percent on
its Hong Kong debut, highlighted that investor confidence has
not fully recovered.	
 ""Investors want to look for stocks now with a track record
with very low valuations. They don't have the appetite for new
stocks,"" said Patrick Yiu, a director at CASH Asset Management.

 Overall market volatility as measured by the VIX index
, Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge"", fell 7 percent to
37.81 on Wednesday, down sharply from this week's peak of 46.88,
lending support to investors cautiously putting some risk back
on in the near-term.	
 The VIX has traded in a 30-48 range after breaking higher in
August, and failures to test the highs this week may raise the
prospect of a swing lower in the near-term. A clear break in
either direction would indicate the next major move.	
 Futures for the Euro STOXX 50 , Germany's DAX
 and France's CAC-40  were 0.7-0.9 percent higher.

 
 MARKETS EYE ECB DECISION	
 Asian credit markets reflected easing strains, with the
iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment grade index
narrowing by about 10 points after a sharp widening at the start
of this week.	
 Investors were likely to remain cautious about whether the
market relief would be sustained, ahead of key events including
the European Central Bank's policy meeting later on Thursday,
the last meeting to be held under the presidency of Jean-Claude
Trichet, and Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls.	
 The ECB was expected to hold rates at 1.5 percent and
restore long-term lending to banks, preparing the ground for a
rate cut before the year-end. The rate decision was due at 1145
GMT, with Trichet's news conference at 1230 GMT. 
 The euro was steady around $1.3350 ahead of the ECB meeting,
well off a nine-month trough of $1.3144 struck this week. 
 In a Reuters survey taken last week, 56 out of 75 economists
said they expected the ECB to hold rates this time around,
though 13 saw a 25 basis points cut and 7 predicted a 50 bp cut.
A rate cut could reignite market jitters about the euro zone's
sovereign debt woes hurting the economy, and resume selling
pressures.	
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that
Berlin was ready to recapitalise its banks if needed, adding
some more reassurance following an agreement on Tuesday by
European finance ministers to safeguard banks in the face of
mounting concerns about a Greek default. 
 Further adding to positive sentiment was data showing growth
in the U.S. service sector stood steady in September and private
hiring picked up, suggesting the economy was not yet slipping
into recession.	
 U.S. crude oil steadied above $79 a barrel on Thursday as a
surprise drawdown in U.S. crude inventories helped offset
pressure from the euro debt crisis. Brent crude  was
above $102.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Global stocks and oil prices
surged on Wednesday on optimism European authorities are moving
to prop up the region's banking sector and after U.S. data
showed the economy is still growing, albeit slowly.
 The euro also rebounded late in the session after Germany
said it is ready to help its own banks and further opened the
possibility of using a regional bailout fund to help strengthen
the euro zone banking system. For details, see [ID:nB5E7KS06Z]
 The euro  traded flat $1.3349.
 Risk aversion eased after data on the U.S. services sector
and private-sector business activity reassured investors
fearing recession. The reports helped offset concerns on data
that suggested Europe is sliding into recession.
 Wall Street rallied and European stocks jumped more than 3
percent, pushed higher by banking shares. Brent crude bounced
more than 2 percent to over $102 a barrel and U.S. futures for
West Texas Intermediate jumped 5 percent.
 ""The market is getting a little more confident that policy
makers are more serious about tackling the problems,"" said
Richard Batty, strategist at Standard Life Investments, which
has $245 billion of assets under management.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 66.08

points, or 1.76 percent, at 2,447.04.
 The benchmark S&P 500 index in the United States had fallen

territory. European shares had tumbled nearly 5 percent the
previous three sessions.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The euro rose for a second
straight day on Wednesday ahead of an ECB meeting, on optimism
about a potential solution to the debt crisis after Germany
said the bailout fund can be used to recapitalize struggling
banks.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the region's largest
economy is ready to help its own banks and further opened the
possibility of using the European Financial Stability Facility
to help strengthen the euro zone banking system. For more,
see[ID:nB5E7KS06Z].
 That drove a rally in U.S. stocks and the euro, which
reversed losses on the day. Most market participants, however,
remained leery of riding the currency's rally before Thursday's
European Central Bank meeting.
 The ECB is likely to leave interest rates unchamged at
Thursday's policy meeting, Jean-Claude Trichet's last as
president, but may announce policy measures to help stimulate
the region's economy. That could further pressure the euro,
which has lost about 10 percent of its value against the dollar
since that late August peak at $1.4550.
 ""There's a lot of potential downside risks on the euro, a
lot of vulnerability,"" said Mary Nicola, currency strategist at
BNP Paribas in New York. ""We're actually forecasting further
weakness in the euro. We expect it to hit $1.30 by the end of
the month.""
 In mid-afternoon trading, the euro  was up 0.2
percent at $1.33679 on electronic trading platform EBS and at
least more than a cent higher from Wednesday's session low of
$1.32600 and a nine-month low of $1.31450 touched on Tuesday.
 Conflicting statements from the International Monetary Fund
on Wednesday spurred volatility in euro/dollar trading.
 An International Monetary Fund official said on Wednesday
the global lender could buy Spanish or Italian bonds alongside
a euro zone bailout fund, but later backed away from his own
suggestion. For more, click on [ID:nN1E7940Z1].
 Moody's downgrade of Italy's sovereign debt ratings further
soured the outlook on the euro as it highlighted the funding
difficulties facing the euro zone's third biggest economy.
 At the same time, France and Belgium were forced to help
Dexia SA  in the first state rescue of a European bank
in the crisis. [ID:nWNA0061] [ID:nL5E7L4447].
 Analysts said the euro may bounce around its current range
as investors remain wary of placing big bets in either
direction given uncertainty surrounding a policy announcement
from the European Central Bank on Thursday
 The euro rose against the Swiss franc to 1.23560 francs,
its highest since late May on EBS .
 U.S. economic reports showing growth in the service sector
and a pickup in private hiring triggered some risk-taking, with
a rise in commodity currencies, but gains have been tempered by
the uncertainty surrounding the euro zone debt crisis. For a
wrapup of economic data, click on [ID:nN1E79407S].
 U.S. non-farm payrolls due on Friday provide another risk
event for investors, as signs the job sector is continuing to
suffer may raise the argument for more U.S. monetary easing to
boost the economy.
The dollar rose to a session peak of 77.070 yen on EBS and
was last at 76.750 yen, down 0.1 percent. Analysts attributed
the dollar strength against the yen to position adjustment
ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday and the U.S. jobs report
on Friday.

 * Euro flat at $1.3350, helped by EU pledge on banking
sector
 * Euro also helped as IMF says may buy Spanish, Italian debt
 * Some see more euro losses, ECB policy risks ahead

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Wednesday as
a pledge by policymakers to strengthen the European banking
sector eased selling pressure, but it remained burdened by a
lack of concrete details to deal with the region's debt crisis
and worries over a Greek default.	
 A rise in European shares kept the single currency away from
a nine-month trough hit on Tuesday against the dollar, with
sentiment towards the euro zone also helped by the IMF hinting
it could invest in Spanish and Italian debt alongside the EFSF
bailout fund. 
 European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn told the FT on Tuesday there was a shared view that
European banks' capital positions must be reinforced, but
investors remain sceptical of ministers' will to act
commensurately to the risks emerging. 
 A downgrade of Italian sovereign debt by ratings agency
Moody's highlighted the funding difficulties facing the euro
zone's third biggest economy, while France and Belgium were
forced to help Dexia SA in the first state rescue of a
European bank in the crisis. 
 Analysts said the single currency could fall further if
investors sense European policymakers are dragging their feet on
plans to leverage the EFSF.	
 ""You really need a credible bank recapitalisation plan,
expansion of EFSF firepower and structural reform in Italy to
ease pressure on the euro,"" said Kiran Kowshik, currency
strategist at BNP Paribas.	
 Any sign that Germany, which is taking the brunt of bailing
out weak countries, was becoming more resistant to working
towards a lasting, coordinated solution to the debt crisis would
also hurt the euro.	
 ""There's just news of discussions about a possible bank
recapitalisations, there's no details yet,"" said Kasper
Kirkegaard, currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen.	
 ""There's a high risk of a further sell-off if we don't get
details on this soon.""	
 The euro was flat on the day at $1.3352, recovering
from a session low of $1.3260. It stayed in a range of $1.3145
hit on Tuesday, its weakest since January.	
 Traders said buying from hedge funds had helped to lift the
euro in late European morning trade as stop-losses were hit
through $1.3360 en-route to a session high of $1.3375.	
 They said the euro may bounce around its current range as
investors were wary of placing big bets in either direction
given uncertainty surrounding a policy announcement from the
European Central Bank on Thursday. 
 
 ECB RISKS	
 Some analysts said a brief corrective rally in the euro to
around $1.34 could not be ruled out after the currency bounced
on Tuesday from levels which, had they been breached, would have
signalled an acceleration of its decline.	
 Key support is seen at $1.3140 -- a 76.4 percent retracement
of a rise from its August 2010 low of $1.2583 to this year's
high above $1.49.	
 Many in the market speculate it faces downward pressure if
the ECB on Thursday opens the door to more monetary easing to
support the economy during the debt turmoil.	
 ""While there could be some initial EUR rebound if the ECB
leaves rates unchanged Thursday, gains are expected to be
short-lived,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. 
 ""Even if the ECB does not cut this week, (ECB President)
Trichet is likely to step up the dovish rhetoric, clearing the
way for action in November.""	
 U.S. non-farm payrolls due on Friday provide another risk
event for investors, as signs the job sector is continuing to
suffer may raise the argument for more U.S. monetary easing to
boost the economy. 
 Federal Reserve President Ben Bernanke on Tuesday said the
economy was ""close to faltering"", and that the central bank was
prepared to take further steps to help. 
 Weak readings of Challenger layoffs and ADP employment on
Wednesday, however, may boost the dollar if investors dump more
risky assets on the view the global economy continues to suffer.

 * Euro up vs dollar after IMF comments on Italy, Spain bonds
 * Market anxious for details of plan for banks - analyst

 By Dominic Lau	
 LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - European shares and key
commodities bounced on Wednesday after ministers agreed to shore
up euro zone banks against the spreading debt crisis and an IMF
director said the fund might offer support by buying Spanish and
Italian bonds.	
 The euro recovered from losses against the dollar after the
International Monetary Fund's European Department Director
Antonio Borges said it could invest in peripheral debt alongside
the euro zone bailout fund. 
 World stocks and commodities including Brent crude had
slumped in recent sessions on mounting concerns that a debt
default by Greece could trigger a banking crisis that would
aggravate a worldwide economic slowdown.	
 Overnight, France and Belgium rescued financial services
group Dexia -- heavily exposed to Greek loans and the
first European lender to have to be bailed out because of the
debt crisis.	
 European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn told the Financial Times on Tuesday the region's finance
ministers, who have hitherto rejected any concerted bank
recapitalisation, had a new sense of urgency. 
 The Dexia rescue also suggested policymakers had become more
aware of the seriousness of the threat -- reflected in a
three-notch downgrade of Italy by rating agency Moody's
overnight -- and that shift in sentiment helped European
equities to recover on Wednesday.	
 Some analysts remained sceptical, however.	
 ""This rally may not last. Lots of stocks look cheap. We need
a strategy for resolving the sovereign debt crisis in the euro
zone. We need a strategy to get on top of the U.S. debt
problem,"" Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley,
said.	
 ""Until we get answers, the market can stay cheap. Economic
authorities in Europe have continually failed to come up with a
robust policy. Now they're in the last-chance saloon.""	
 Shares were also underpinned by IMF director Borges'
comments on Italian and Spanish bonds.	
 U.S. stock index futures    rose 0.6 to
0.8 percent, indicating a firm start on Wall Street after a late
rally on Thursday pushed the S&P 500 index to its largest
gain in more than a week.	
 The STOXX Europe 600 share index advanced 2.2
percent, with banking shares up 2.7 percent. Dexia
gained 5.1 percent after losing more than one-third of its value
in the previous four sessions.	
 The pan-European share index, which has lost 19 percent so
far this year, carried a 12-month forward price-to-earnings
ratio of 8.8 versus the S&P 500's 10.7 and Japan's TOPIX index's
11.4, data from Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.	
 
 Italy's share benchmark put on 1.9 percent,
shrugging off the ratings cut that brought Moody's into line
with peer S&P, which cut the country by one notch to single-A
last month. 
 Moody's cited a ""material increase"" in funding risks for
euro zone countries with high levels of debt and warning that
further downgrades were possible.	
 Adding to the underlying gloom, the euro zone's private
sector shrank for the first time in two years in September,
contracting faster than first reported as new business dried up
while the debt crisis cut expectations for the future to
two-year lows, surveys showed on Wednesday. 
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.3361 though was
down 0.1 percent at 102.41 yen . The dollar was
off 0.9 percent against a basket of major currencies.	
 Yields on 10-year Italian government bonds
rose 4.9 basis points to 5.546 percent, while those on 10-year
benchmark German Bunds rose 8.1 basis points to
1.803 percent after falling in the previous three sessions.	
 
 DETAILS, DETAILS, DETAILS	
 Many in the foreign exchange market remained firmly negative
on the euro, and analysts said if investors sensed that European
policymakers continued to drag their feet in solving the debt
problems, the common currency could fall more.	
 Still, while the euro is down 5.6 percent against the yen
and 1.9 percent versus the Swiss franc this year, it has lost
only 0.1 percent against the dollar.	
 ""At this point, there's just been news of discussions about
a possible bank recapitalisations, there's no details yet,"" said
Kasper Kirkegaard, currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen. 
 ""There's a high risk of a further sell-off if we don't get
details on this soon.""	
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
put on 0.8 percent, after hitting a 15-month low
the previous session.	
 Asian shares outside of Japan added 0.6
percent, though Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.9 percent.	
 Copper rose 1.6 percent to trade above $6,900 a
tonne, snapping a five-day losing streak, and Brent crude
 added 1.3 percent to above $101 a barrel after a
three-session losing run, while gold eased 0.8 percent.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The euro faltered on Wednesday as
macro funds and Tokyo exporters piled pressure on it by taking
profits after an overnight rally, but charts suggested recent
heavy selling could ease for now.	
 Investors were sceptical even though European finance
ministers agreed on Tuesday to safeguard their banks from the
debt crisis with more doubts emerging whether a planned second
bailout for Greece would go ahead. 
 Underscoring the fragility of risk sentiment, Asian bourses
failed to take their cue from a late rally on Wall Street,
prompting macro funds to continue unwinding positions funded in
dollars and yen. 
 As a result, the euro dipped 0.4 percent to $1.3292 ,
not far from a nine-month low of $1.3145 plumbed the day before.
It also slid towards a decade low on the yen, shedding 0.6
percent to 101.92 yen .	
 ""Macro funds are trying to offset some of the huge losses
made on stocks this year by taking profits or cutting losses on
their positions in the euro and the Aussie,"" said Tsutomu Soma,
a senior manager at Okasan Securities' foreign securities
department in Tokyo.	
 Soma suggested that despite the heavy selling, a brief
corrective rally in the euro to around $1.34 could not be ruled
out after the currency bounced on Tuesday from levels which, had
they been breached, would have signalled an acceleration of its
decline.	
 The euro jumped from above key support at $1.3140 -- a 76.4
percent retracement of a rise from its August 2010 low of
$1.2583 to this year's high above $1.49.	
 ""The long-term downtrend is clearly unchanged, but the
euro's fall has been interrupted by rounds of short-covering and
we may see some of that later in the day,"" Soma said.	
 Echoing this view, analysts at BNP Paribas said better
two-way trades in euro/dollar and euro crosses looked possible
in the days ahead, although they warned the euro could still
fall below $1.3000.	
 Stop loss triggers were seen around $1.34, while a thick
layer of offers was poised to cap any rebound in euro/yen around
103 yen.	
 The single European currency's bounce came after France and
Belgium rushed to the aid of Dexia SA in the first
state rescue of a European bank in the euro-zone sovereign debt
crisis. 
 But traders doubted that the move by European officials
could stave off a further decline in the euro as more and more
European banks are being shut out of the market and relying on
the European Central Bank for liquidity.	
Tensions remained, with Euro zone finance
ministers postponing a crucial aid payment to Greece until
mid-November, while European Union ministers said they were
reviewing the size of private-sector involvement in a second
bailout package for Athens. 
 ""The bottom line is there is still going to be a lot of
safe-haven bidding for the U.S. dollar because the world economy
has slowed appreciably,"" said Joseph Capurso, a strategist at
Commonwealth Bank in Sydney.	
 Also weighing on the euro was Moody's downgrade of Italy's
bond rating by three notches to A2, which brought its rating in
line with Standard & Poor's. 
 News that Japan may purchase more bonds issued by Europe's
bailout fund to help contain the euro-debt crisis had little
impact on the euro. 


 
 FURTHER STEPS	
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke helped lift risk
sentiment by saying the central bank was prepared to take
further steps to bolster the U.S. recovery. 
 Although the dollar index dipped to 79.162,
retreating from a nine-month high of 79.838, most market players
agreed that safe-haven inflows were likely to boost the
greenback and outweigh any selling on speculation that the Fed
may ease monetary policy again.	
 The dollar drifted down to 76.65 yen , above Tuesday's
low around 76.51 yen, with strong bids seen supporting the pair
below that level. 
 The currency pair remained tethered in a narrow band,
trapped by the threat of more yen-weakening intervention by
Japanese authorities.	
 The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent against the yen, at
one point dipping as low as 72.64 yen , with macro
funds unwinding their positions funded in the yen, largely
ignoring positive Australian retail sales numbers. 
 The Aussie slipped 0.2 percent versus the dollar to $0.9530
, not far from a one-year low of $0.9388.	
 Wespac Institutional Bank said investors and speculators are
liquidating long positions in the Aussie at a record pace,
adding that the underlying flow trend among long-term players
has turned decidedly negative.

 By Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - European stock index futures rose
on Wednesday, despite scepticism among investors about whether
European leaders are going far enough in their efforts to fix
the region's sovereign debt crisis that prompted Asian stocks to
trim earlier gains.	
 Doubts also grew over the sustainability of Tuesday's rise
in U.S. stocks, which came after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke eased concerns over the damage to the U.S. economy from
a possible Greek default with a promise of more economic
stimulus if needed.	
 ""The market in Asia is testing Bernanke's resolve to be able
to provide stimulus,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing director
of Commodity Broking Services.	
 ""What the market wants to see is something definite, and it
is losing faith in what Bernanke can deliver.""	
 S&P 500 futures  eased 0.3 percent in Asian trading,
suggesting a weaker start on Wall Street.	
 In credit markets, which have been showing increasing signs
of strain in recent weeks, the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment
grade index widened slightly from the open, but at
a much slower pace than a sharp widening earlier this week.	
 
 
 MOODY'S REMINDS	
 In the latest blow to be dealt to investor confidence by
Europe's intractable crisis, Moody's on Tuesday slashed its
bonds rating on the euro zone's third-largest economy Italy by
three notches, saying it saw a ""material increase"" in funding
risks for euro zone nations and warning of more possible cuts.	
 ""They have to be continuously seen to be working on the
problem,"" said Barratt, adding that European policymakers needed
to show concrete action to convince the markets they can stop
the region's debt woes triggering a full-blown banking crisis.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.5 percent, having been up as much as 0.9
percent earlier. It hit a two-year low the day before.	
 But Japanese and Korean shares turned negative after an
initial gain. The Nikkei fell 0.86 percent, after
opening up 0.4 percent, with the broader Topix index
tumbling below lows marked after a major earthquake in March as
foreign investors looked to cut risk in their portfolios. 
 ""There are now hopes that a worst-case scenario in Europe
will be avoided, but because this plan is still under
consideration and is not formally decided yet, plenty of risks
remain,"" said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist at SMBC Friend
Securities.	
 South Korean stocks extended their slide and the
government revived weekly crisis management meetings to try to
stem capital flight from its financial markets, which are
particularly vulnerable as Korean banks carry a heavy load of
short-term debt. 
 European stock index futures pointed to sharp gains after
heavy losses in the previous three sessions, with futures for
the Euro STOXX 50 , Germany's DAX  and France's
CAC-40  up 1.3-1.7 percent.

 EURO FALTERS	
 As the euro slipped from highs, gold's rise was capped,
while other commodities such as oil and copper struggled to
extend gains on lingering concerns over global demand.	
 Brent crude  was up 1.75 percent, but off an intraday
high of $102.10 a barrel, as tighter U.S. crude stocks and
promises by the Fed to launch new stimulus measures if necessary
helped halt a sharp three-day sell-off. 
 U.S. crude  traded up $2.11 at $77.78 a barrel. 
 The euro eased 0.4 percent against the dollar, faltering
after a brief rally that had lifted the single currency from a
near nine-month trough against the dollar and a decade low
versus the yen on Tuesday. 
 U.S. Treasuries stabilised in Asia on Wednesday, with the
10-year notes yielding 1.83 percent against 1.82
percent in late U.S. trade, when demand for the safety of
government bonds eased following Bernanke soothing comments.

 European finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to safeguard
their banks as doubts grew about whether a planned second
bailout package for debt-laden Greece would go ahead.	
 A sense of urgency appeared to be heightening in Europe as
French-Belgian municipal lender Dexia SA became the
first European bank to have to be bailed out due to the euro
zone's sovereign debt crisis.	
 Tensions remained, however, as euro zone finance ministers
postponed a crucial aid payment to Greece until mid-November,
while European Union ministers said they were reviewing the size
of private-sector involvement in a second bailout package for
Athens. 
 Japan, which holds 20 percent of the total bonds issued by
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), on Wednesday
offered its share of help, saying it would consider continuing
its purchases of bonds issued by Europe's bailout fund.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A late rally in U.S. stocks
pulled Wall Street out of bear market territory on Tuesday, and
the euro rose versus the dollar after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke promised more economic stimulus if needed.
 U.S. markets once again turned on news out of Europe.
 Reports that European finance ministers agreed to prepare
action to safeguard their banks, following the first bailout of
a lender as a result of the region's debt crisis, were cited as
giving stocks a boost heading into the close. For details see
[ID:nL5E7L419D].
 Investors also took Bernanke's speech to Congress as
leaving the door open for another round of quantitative easing
policies, helping to offset concerns about the economic
consequences of a possible Greek default. For details, see
[ID:nN1E7930IZ]
 It also reduced the safe-haven appeal of U.S. government
bonds and the dollar, allowing the euro to rally more than 1
percent.
 The S&P 500 Index <.SPX>, a broad measure of the U.S. stock
market, had briefly entered bear market territory earlier in
the session when it fell to a level 20 percent from its 2011
high. A bear market is usually a sign that stock losses may be
sustained.
 The steep losses attracted bargain hunters, who massively
stepped into the market in the final hour of trading. Chip
makers and large-cap technology shares led the market higher.
 ""To me, it looked mostly technical. It looked like the
capitulation on the sell side,"" said Keith Springer, president
of Springer Financial Advisors in Sacramento, California.
 He said the reports out of Europe only added to buying
frenzy that had started earlier.
 ""You could see it starting to turn anyway and that gave
people an excuse"" to buy, Springer said.
 Market volatility will likely remain high as long as the
euro zone debt crisis drags on investor sentiment. After
markets closed, ratings agency Moody's downgraded Italy by
three notches, increasing fears of contagion from Greece.
 Athens appeared more likely to default on its debt after
euro zone finance ministers postponed a vital aid payment to
Athens until mid-November. [ID:nL5E7L419D] [ID:nN1E79324C]
 The impact of a possible default on the global economy and
particularly on the banking sector worried markets after
European Union ministers said they were reviewing the size of
private-sector involvement in a second bailout package for
Greece.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes had fallen more than 2
percent earlier in the day, but recovered after Bernanke's
speech.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 153.41
points, or 1.44 percent, at 10,808.71, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 24.72 points, or 2.25 percent, to
1,123.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 68.99
points, or 2.95 percent, to 2,404.82.
 The U.S. bank sector index <.GSPF>, down nearly 30 percent
since the 2011 market high hit on April 29, posted strong
gains. The index finished the session up 4.1 percent as shares
of Morgan Stanley  jumped 12.3 percent.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS>, a gauge
of world stocks, trimmed losses, but still fell 0.3 percent.
 OIL HITS ONE-YEAR LOW, EURO GAINS
 U.S. crude oil prices  slid $1.94, or 2.5 percent, to
close at $75.67 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Sept. 23,
2010, on fears that a global slowdown will curb demand for oil
and other commodities.
 The euro , however, rallied 1.27 percent against the
dollar to $1.3347, after hitting a near nine-month low against
the greenback earlier in the session.
 ""This is just a correction in a euro bear market,"" said Jay
Meisler, co-founder of Global-View.com in Huntington, New
York.
 ""Part of the rally could be traced to Trichet as well,"" he
added, in reference to the president of the European Central
Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet. ""He could have signaled a rate cut
today, but he did not. So you've got to go on the assumption
that the ECB is not going to cut rates this week.""
 The ECB's policy-makers are to meet on Thursday. There have
been expectations in markets that the ECB would raise rates on
Thursday.
 In the government debt market, longer-dated Treasuries led
the losses, with the 30-year bond  falling 1-26/32
points in price for a yield of 2.807 percent.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid into bear
market territory on Tuesday, and prices of U.S. crude oil fell
to a one-year low, driven by fears of another global recession
as Greece appeared increasingly likely to default.
 The S&P 500 Index <.SPX>, a broad measure of the U.S. stock
market, was down more than 20 percent from its 2011 high,
marking a bear market threshold that, for many investors, is a

 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke provided some
comfort, saying in congressional testimony that the U.S.
central bank was ready to act further to support the economy.

 His statement, some investors said, left the door open to
another round of quantitative easing policies, which reduced
the safe-haven appeal of U.S. government bonds and the dollar,
allowing the euro to rally against the greenback.
 ""The stock market declines show increased worry about
recession, but we still see some signs that the economy is
growing and not contracting,"" said Gary Thayer, chief macro
strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis, Missouri.
 ""The markets are worried. Investors are uncertain about
what's happening in Europe, and until we see some of that
uncertainty cleared up, we are likely to have highly volatile
markets,"" he added.
 Greece appeared more likely to default on its debt after
euro zone finance ministers postponed a vital aid payment to
Athens until mid-November. [ID:nL5E7L419D]
 The impact of a possible default on the global economy and
particularly on the banking sector worried markets after
European Union ministers said they were reviewing the size of
private-sector involvement in a second bailout package for
Greece.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes had fallen more than 2
percent earlier in the day, but trimmed losses after Bernanke's
speech.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 160.44
points, or 1.51 percent, at 10,494.86, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> dropped 12.41 points, or 1.13 percent,
to 1,086.82. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 15.38
points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,320.45.
 Morgan Stanley  was down 4 percent at $11.97. The
stock is off about 56 percent this year. Shares of Bank of
America  were down 4.7 percent at $5.27.
 World stocks hit a 15-month low, with the MSCI All-Country
World index <.MIWD00000PUS> sliding 2.2 percent.
 OIL HITS ONE-YEAR LOW, EURO GAINS
 U.S. crude oil prices  closed 2.5 percent lower at
$75.67 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Sept. 23, 2010, on
fears that a global slowdown will curb demand for oil and other
commodities.
 The euro  was up 0.45 percent against the dollar at
$1.3239, after hitting a near nine-month low against the
greenback earlier in the session.
 ""This is just a correction in a euro bear market,"" said Jay
Meisler, co-founder of Global-View.com in Huntington, New York.
 ""Part of the rally could be traced to Trichet as well,"" he
added, in reference to the president of the European Central
Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet. ""He could have signaled a rate cut
today, but he did not. So you've got to go on the assumption
that the ECB is not going to cut rates this week.""
 The ECB's policymakers are to meet on Thursday. There have
been expectations in markets that the ECB would raise rates on
Thursday.
 In the government debt market, longer-dated Treasuries led
the losses, with 30-year bonds  falling more than 1
point in price for a yield of 2.7675 percent.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were on the verge
of bear market territory on Tuesday, and U.S. crude oil prices
fell to a 2011 low as investors worried about the economic
implications of an increasingly likely Greek default.
 The S&P 500 Index <.SPX>, a broad measure of the U.S.
stock market, initially slid more than 20 percent from its
2011 closing high. Wall Street defines a drop of 20 percent or
more from a recent high as a bear market which, for many
investors, is a sign that stock losses may be sustained for a
longer period of time.
 Investors, however, received some comfort from a speech by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who said the central
bank was ready to act further to support the economy. For

 U.S. crude oil prices  dropped as low as $74.95 a

crude oil contract was down 1.3 percent, or 98 cents, at
$76.66 a barrel in early afternoon trading.

 NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The euro bounced from a near
nine-month low and rallied sharply against the dollar on
Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the
central bank is prepared to act further to help the economy.
 For details on Bernanke's remarks see [ID:nW1E7KM007].
 The move higher in the euro then fed on itself as investors
who had bet against the single currency were forced to buy and
cover short positions to prevent more losses.
 ""We've been selling off over the last 48 hours or so, so
we're overdue for a little bit of a bounce,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""The

 The euro rose as high as $1.3301  on trading
platform EBS. It last traded at $1.32661, up 0.7 percent on the
day.
 ""The euro has been selling off for days,"" said Jessica
Hoversen, foreign exchange analyst at MF Global in New York.
Investors ""are grabbing on to Bernanke.""
 But investors cautioned the euro's gains may not last.
 Earlier the euro weakened after European finance ministers
debated making banks take bigger losses on Greek debt and
delayed a vital aid payment to Athens until mid-November.
 The single currency  fell to $1.3145 on electronic
trading platform EBS, its weakest since January as a slide in
stocks and a collapse in the shares of Franco-Belgian banking
group Dexia  -- which has hefty exposure to Greek debt
-- prompted flight to the safety of the world's most liquid
currency.
 Investors still see a growing possibility of a default in
Athens as euro zone finance ministers look to force banks to
take bigger losses on their Greek debt holdings, while the next
aid tranche for the country has been delayed until
mid-November. [ID:nL5E7L34AJ]
 Technical traders said the outlook for the common currency
had turned increasingly negative after a bearish cross on the
50- and 200-day moving averages, while support was seen at
$1.3040, a 61.8 percent retracement of the rally from June 2010
to May 2011.
 Chris Fernandes, vice president and foreign exchange
adviser at San Ramon, California-based Bank of the West said
the euro would test $1.3000 but not before the ECB meeting on
Thursday.
 While those who believe the ECB may cut its benchmark rate
are in the minority, Fernandes said, the ECB statement will be
closely scrutinized for clues as to the ECB's outlook.
 The euro also fell to its lowest since at least 2004 on EBS
at 100.77 yen  before recovering to trade with a
gain of 1 percent to 101.971.
 The dollar was last up 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc
at 0.9236 Swiss francs on EBS  after earlier touching
a six month high.
 The greenback was 0.3 percent higher against the yen at
76.855 yen .
 AUSSIE HIT
 The Australian dollar hit a one-year low of US$0.9388
, down around 17 percent from the post float high it
touched in July, as an increasing number of investors start to
worry about Chinese growth. The Aussie was floated in 1983.
 The commodities-driven Australian currency extended losses
after the country's central bank opened the door to possible
monetary easing as early as next month if upcoming inflation
data proves benign.
 From a technical standpoint, it also looks prone to more
selling given a ""death cross"" of the 50-day moving average
under the 200-day average, the first such formation in more
than a year.
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects the Aussie to fall
below 90 U.S. cents in the next month or so.
 The Canadian dollar also slipped against the U.S. dollar to
a one-year low .

 * Threat of Greek default spooks investors, hits risky FX
 * Dollar index rises to 9-month high, Aussie slides

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The euro hit a nine-month low
against the dollar and a 10-year trough against the yen on
Tuesday as euro zone policymakers failed to quell rising
speculation of a Greek debt default, hitting riskier currencies
and boosting the greenback. 
 The single currency fell to $1.3145, its weakest
since January as a 3 percent slide in European stocks
and a collapse in the shares of Franco-Belgian banking group
Dexia -- which has hefty exposure to Greek debt --
pushed investors into the safety of the world's most liquid
currency.	
 Investors see a growing possibility of a default in Athens
as euro zone finance ministers look to force banks to take
bigger losses on their Greek debt holdings, while the next aid
tranche for the country has been delayed until mid-November.

 Dexia's precipitous drop highlights the potential impact of
a Greek default on the euro zone banking sector.	
 The euro pared some of its losses to trade 0.2
percent higher on the day at $1.3200, but traders and analysts
said the move was driven by profit taking on the latest slide,
and many expected it would fall further.	
 ""The newsflow remains very much on the negative side, so we
have to be cautious about the rebound in the euro,"" said Ian
Stannard, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley.	
 ""There has been very little progress at the finance
ministers' meeting and a delay in the next bailout funds for
Greece. This signals that progress is not being made (in solving
the debt crisis), leaving the euro vulnerable.""	
 Market participants said an option with a strike price of
$1.32 was expiring later in the day, which may anchor the single
currency in the very near term. Stronger demand was located
around large $1.3100 barriers.	
 Technical traders said the outlook for the common currency
had turned increasingly negative after a bearish cross on the
50- and 200-day moving averages, while support was seen at
$1.3040, a 61.8 percent retracement of the rally from $1.1876 in
June 2010 to $1.4940 in May 2011.	
 Stannard at Morgan Stanley anticipated more weakness for the
euro, particularly given that the European Central Bank may be
poised to signal it will ease monetary policy to support the
euro zone economy through the debt storm.	
 As a result, the euro could fall below $1.30 this week, he
said, while strategists at Barclays Capital forecast a fall to
$1.25 in the next three months.	
 ""The market is increasingly worried about the ... Greek
crisis and the calamity that could be created if there was a
messy default."" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank.	
 The euro also hit a 10-year low of 100.77 yen
before recovering to trade with gains of 0.3 percent at 101.10.
Some analysts said extreme short positioning for the euro could
limit scope for significant falls in the near term.	
 The dollar was a big beneficiary of the euro's weakness,
climbing as high as 79.823 against a currency basket, its
strongest since mid-January. It also hit a six-month high versus
the Swiss franc .	
 The greenback was little changed against the yen at 76.68
yen .	
 
 AUSSIE HIT 
 The Australian dollar hit a one-year low of US$0.9414
, down around 15 percent from a 29-year high reached in
July, as an increasing number of investors start to worry about
Chinese growth, which many had counted on as the main growth
driver globally as developed economies flop. 
 The commodities-driven Australian currency extended losses
after the country's Reserve Bank opened the door to possible
monetary easing as early as next month if upcoming inflation
data proves to be benign.	
 From a technical standpoint, it looks prone to more selling
given a ""death cross"" of the 50-day moving average over the
200-day average, the first such formation in more than a year.	
 Traders cited decent bids around $0.9400, which could offer
short-term support, but Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects
the Aussie fall below 90 U.S. cents in the next month or so. 
 The Canadian dollar also slipped, to a one-year low of
C$1.0577 . 
 As concerns about a global economic downturn escalate,
investors awaited testimony later in the day from Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who will speak on the economic
outlook. Many in the market expect bearish prospects for the
already sluggish U.S. economy would weigh on risky assets.

plunges
 * Euro hits 10-year low vs yen; German 5-year CDS hit record

 By Natsuko Waki	
 LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a fresh 15-month
low on Tuesday and the euro fell across the board as the growing
prospect of a near-term default by Greece stoked fears of a
major banking crisis in Europe, which would accelerate a global
economic slowdown.	
 The cost of insuring German sovereign debt against default
hit a record high for a second day in a row, reflecting concerns
that the euro zone's paymaster-in-chief will have to dig ever
deeper into its pockets to bail out the region's weaker states.	
 A fresh sell-off in risky assets began after euro zone
finance ministers said they were reviewing the size of private
sector involvement in a second bailout package for Greece, a
move that could undermine the aid plan and hasten a default.	
 The prospect of private creditors taking a bigger writedown
on their holdings of Greek debt than agreed in July added to
unease about an already fragile European banking sector.	
 European banking shares fell 4.2 percent, with Dexia
shedding as much as 37 percent on top of its 10
percent fall on Monday due to worries about the Franco-Belgian
bank's heavy exposure to Greece.	
 ""The tone for the euro is sour after the failure of the euro
zone finmins to bring anything concrete to the table with
respect to Greece,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist
at Rabobank.	
 ""The market is increasingly worried about the potential of
the Greek crisis and the calamity that could be created if there
was a messy default.""	
 There had been no discussion about Greece defaulting, the
country's finance minister told a news conference in Athens.

 The MSCI world equity index fell 1.5
percent, hitting its lowest since July 2010. The index has
fallen more than 18 percent since January and more than 24
percent since hitting a three-year high in March.	
 U.S. stock futures were down 0.3 percent , pointing to
a weaker open on Wall Street later.	
 
 BANKS UNDER PRESSURE	
 European stocks lost 2.6 percent while emerging
stocks fell 2 percent to hit their lowest since
September 2009.	
 Dexia, whose shares hit a record low, vowed to fix its
balance sheet after Moody's placed the group on a review for a
possible downgrade, warning about its liquidity. According to a
Belgian newspaper report on Tuesday, Dexia could be split up and
its 'good' assets sold by the end of 2011. 
 France and Belgium, working with central banks, said they
would take all measures necessary to protect Dexia's account
holders and creditors. 
 Euro zone ministers also agreed Greece could wait until
mid-November for the next instalment from the existing aid
programme, putting further pressure on Athens to get to grips
with its debt problems .	
 ""What you're now beginning to see is they (investors) are
now picking out the banks. Dexia is the weakest,"" said Justin
Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management. 
 ""Politicians have to stand behind these banks -- whether you
call it state support, nationalisation, you have to keep the
financial system working otherwise we will end up with another
credit crisis.""	
 German five-year credit default swaps rose to 121 basis
points while Belgium's five-year CDS gained 14
bps to 286 bps, close to a Sept 22 record high. 
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.5 percent to $76.45 a barrel.	
 Bund futures  rose 88 ticks.	
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies to a fresh nine-month high. The euro fell as
low as $1.3144, a nine-month trough. It also fell to a 10-year
low of 100.78 yen .

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The dollar was supported near a
9-month high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday with the
market gripped by fear that the debt crisis in Europe could
unleash substantial damage on the global economy.	
 The euro hit a nine-month low in early Tuesday trade before
posting a slim recovery, while the Australian dollar slipped to
a one-year trough as market players continued to pull funds out
of shares, copper and other risky growth-linked assets.	
""The market has started the new quarter with more concerns
over the global financial system and the ability of authorities
to contain the increasing sense of doom over the European
financial system,"" said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in
Sydney. 
 Euro zone finance ministers are reviewing the size of the
private sector's involvement in a second international bailout
package for Greece, a move that could undermine the aid
programme and intensify the threat of a Greek default.

 Despite ever deeper cost-cutting measures, Greece admitted
on Monday that it will miss its fiscal deficit target this year,
sparking fresh doubts over a planned second international
bailout. 
 Ministers also agreed after a meeting on Monday that Greece
could wait until mid-November until it receives the next
instalment from its existing emergency aid programme, cancelling
their next meeting on Oct 13, when they were originally planning
to sign off on the 8 billion euro payment to Greece.	
 ""The bailout plan appears to be pushed to the limit. It
seems even as if policymakers needed some time to discuss an
orderly default,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC
Nikko Securities.	
 The euro fell to as low as $1.3163 early on Tuesday
before stepping back to around $1.3207, up slightly on
short-covering from $1.3170 in late U.S. trade.	
 One possible target for the currency is around $1.3040, a
61.8 percent retracement of its long-term rally from around
$1.1876 in June 2010 to $1.4940 in May 2011.	
 But as speculators' net euro short positions reached their
highest in more than a year last week, as shown in data from the
U.S. financial watchdog, the euro could be spared from massive
falls in the near term, some analysts said.	
 Instead speculators may be inclined to sell commodity
currencies such as the Australian dollar, positioning on which
is closer to neutral.	
 The Aussie fell to a one-year low of $0.9454 as an
increasing number of market players start to worry about the
soundness of Chinese growth, which many investors have counted
on as the main growth driver globally as developed economies
flop.	
 Highlighting such concerns is a sharp fall in the price of
copper, of which China is by far the biggest consumer, to a
one-year low on Monday.	
 The currency extended losses after the Reserve Bank of
Australia opened the door to possible easing as early as next
month if upcoming inflation data proves to be benign, saying an
""improved inflation outlook would increase the scope for
monetary policy to provide some support to demand"".	
 
 SPOOKY	
 Also spooking market players are worries that losses from
falling euro zone debt prices could hurt not only European banks
but their U.S counterparts as well.	
 In fact, the cost of insurance against default by U.S. banks
has soared in the past two months, with CDS spreads on some
institutions now exceeding those on many European banks.	
 On top of the euro zone's debt woes, there were also worries
that the United States may be slipping back into a recession,
without having recovered strongly from the 2008 crisis. 
 Hideki Amikura, forex manager at Nomura Trust Bank said
investors' U.S. inflation expectations judged from breakeven
yields on U.S. inflation-protected bonds are about to fall to
levels normally associated with recession, with the 30-year
breakeven yield falling below 2 percent.	
 ""The whole U.S. quantitative easing and jobless recovery
festa has finished - period. We could be in for a shakeout even
larger than the Lehman shock,"" he said, noting that the U.S. is
running out of policy options as it needs to cut its deficit and
as monetary easing meets opposition from some politicians.	
 Worries about banks overwhelmed so much that the market
chose to ignore upbeat readings on U.S. manufacturing and auto
sales data on Monday.	
 As market players try to hoard the dollar, the world's most
liquid currency, it stayed near its nine-month peak hit on
Monday. It stood at 79.546 , near Monday's high of 79.696.	
 The greenback was little changed against the yen -- as usual
in recent months -- at 76.71 yen . 
 The yen was bought sharply during the 2008-09 crisis as many
market players unwound yen-carry trades, but some analysts said
such trades have not accumulated so much recently, meaning the
yen has limited reasons to gain.

 By Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European stock index futures fell
on Tuesday, after global stocks sank to a 15-month low, as
investors shed riskier assets on growing doubts over Greece's
ability to avoid default that fuelled fears of global financial
turmoil and recession.	
 Concerns over the banking sector's exposure to euro zone
sovereign debt and plummeting asset values across the board
prompted a further sharp widening of credit default swaps.	
 With private sector economists cutting growth forecasts in
the face of a darkening economic picture, the weakening outlook
for industrial demand weighed on copper and oil, while
flight-to-safety strengthened gold, the yen and the dollar.	
 ""Investors are cutting their exposure to risk as the most
extreme risks -- such as Greek default -- are looming closer
than they expected,"" said Jung Sang-jin, a senior fund manager
at Dongbu Asset Management.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell as much as 2.6 percent to just above a
16-month low hit in late September before recovering slightly.
It fell about 3.6 percent on Monday and is 30 percent below its
2011 high in April.	
 
 Economists at Goldman Sachs said they now expected the euro
area to slip into recession beginning in the fourth quarter, and
cut their 2012 growth forecast for the United States to 1.4
percent, from 2 percent, as the crisis bites.	
 ING also cut its growth forecasts for the developed world.	
 The MSCI All-Country World index fell as
much as 0.7 percent to its lowest level since July 2010, adding
to declines on Monday, when bank shares were battered.	
 
 ""BIGGER THAN LEHMAN""	
 Franco-Belgian financial group Dexia vowed on
Tuesday to clean up its balance sheet after concerns about its
exposure to Greece, and a Belgian newspaper report said the
bank will be split up into ""good"" and ""bad"" assets.

 Japan's Nikkei fell to a 6-1/2-month low as a
sell-off in commodities pushed trading houses lower and the
Greek woes pressured the financial sector. 
 ""We could be in for a shakeout even larger than the Lehman
shock,"" said Hideki Amikura, forex manager at Nomura Trust Bank.	
 The massive selling pressures prompted some authorities to
step in to help restore some order.	
 The Korea Exchange temporarily suspended programme sales on
the main Korea Composite Stock Price Index in early
trade on Tuesday due to drastic falls in futures as the broader
market tumbled more than 5 percent.	
 Taiwan state funds were seen stepping into the local market
to prop up heavyweights such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co , the world's top contract chipmaker,
helping the market erase earlier losses to trade flat.	
 European stock index futures pointed to a sharp drop when
trading starts, with futures for the Euro STOXX 50 ,
Germany's DAX , France's CAC-40  down 1.6-1.7
percent.

 CDS WIDENS	
 As credit markets feel the strain, the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan
investment grade index widened by 13 basis points
on Tuesday, after expanding 15 bps on Monday. 
 ""Banks are faced with concerns over their exposure to
Europe's debt, but on top of that, the latest market tumble also
brings to light that it is also weakening banks' financial
strength as they themselves are investors,"" said Akane Enatsu,
credit analyst at Barclays Capital in Japan.	
 ""Banks are in a bind and they can't get out of the
situation,"" she said.	
 Europe's financials were also wider, with 5-year CDS on BNP
Paribas widening by 6.5 basis points and
Deutsche Bank's 5-year CDS up 5.6 basis points. 
 The market's overwhelming focus on Greece's financial woes
overshadowed a better-than-expected reading from the U.S.
Institute of Supply Management's September manufacturing index
and a rise in construction spending, potential evidence that the
U.S. economy can avoid a recession.	
 With a bleak global demand outlook, oil fell more than $1
earlier on Tuesday, pressured by the debt concerns and a
stronger dollar. U.S. crude  fell to an intraday low of
$75.92 a barrel, while Brent crude  fell to as low as
$100.50. 
 The yen, often regarded as safe haven, hovered near a
10-year peak against the euro while the other safe haven
currency, the U.S. dollar, firmed near a 9-month high against a
basket of currencies. 
 Investor preference for safer assets accelerated flows into
gold, pushing the market up 1 percent while copper tumbled 4
percent as investors dumped the industrial metal on worries over
a slowdown in growth and turned to dollar holdings.	
 European policymakers met on Monday to discuss ways to
leverage the euro zone's rescue fund and pressure Greece to
implement agreed structural reforms.

 * Short euros dominate hedge fund portfolios
(Updates prices, adds comment)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro fell to its lowest
level in more than eight months against the dollar on Monday,
as fears of a Greek default deepened after the debt-ridden
country said it will not meet the deficit target set out under
its bailout plan.
 The single euro zone currency posted its largest one-day
loss since Sept. 9, according to trading platform EBS.
 Adding to negative sentiment and the market's risk-averse
mood was a decision by Moody's to place French-Belgian
financial services group Dexia  on review for possible
downgrade.
 Dexia has been undermined by its exposure to Greece,
raising pressure on its state shareholders to consider a second
bailout. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L30GX]
 The euro's losses partly reflect that ""there has not really
been any resolution on the EU side with Greece and their
approved budget misses the targets it needs to achieve,"" said
Alex Sinton, senior dealer at ANZ Institutional in Auckland,
New Zealand.
 Greek officials said the country will not meet its deficit
target for 2011 even as it imposes austerity measures to boost
revenue and cut future borrowing needs, which are requirements
imposed by the European Union and the International Monetary
Fund for disbursement of more cash to pay maturing debt.
[ID:nL5E7L31G6]
 Without the funds, Greece will likely default, a scenario
that is being increasingly priced in by the market.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro was down 1.5 percent at
$1.31919 , after falling as low as $1.31820 -- its
lowest point since mid-January.
 Even so, technically, the euro looked ""a little
over-extended,"" said ANZ's Sinton, who said it could retrace
losses and potentially rise in the Asian session to the $1.3310
area.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 1.6 percent at 101.500
yen . Earlier it touched a low of 101.400, the
lowest since at least 2004 on EBS.
 Euro zone finance ministers met on Monday and were expected
to put pressure on Greece to implement agreed structural
reforms and to discuss options for leveraging the European
Financial Stability Facility, the bailout fund.
[ID:nL5E7L30G0]
 Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT in Jersey City,
New Jersey, said she was not confident anything of substance
would come out of the meeting.
 ""We do not expect EU finance ministers to make a decision
to release funds to Greece at their meeting this week nor do we
expect them to be able to reach an agreement on expanding the
European Financial Stability Facility,"" Lien said.
 EURO ZONE MANUFACTURING CONTRACTS
 As the debt crisis showed little sign of abating, the euro
zone's manufacturing contraction worsened in September as new
orders shrank at the fastest pace since June 2009.
 Investors are also awaiting a European Central Bank
interest rate decision on Thursday. Some market players expect
the ECB will cut rates by 25 basis points and announce fresh
liquidity measures to support the banking sector.
 Speculators have also been adding to bearish bets against
the euro, a trend that is likely to continue [IMM/FX].
 The options market further points to a strong appetite for
long-term euro/dollar puts -- bets that the euro will weaken.
One-year risk reversal spreads  remain near a
recent record high.
 Risk reversal skews favoring the downside in the euro
against the dollar are further supported by positioning among
hedge funds and short-term investors.
 For Christian Von Strachwitz, chief investment officer at
Quaesta Capital in Zurich, Switzerland, long U.S. dollar
positions versus the euro dominated his portfolio last week, a
trend that has been in place for the several weeks. Quaesta is
a currency fund of funds with assets of $3 billion.
 The euro has also seen the biggest outflow in the latest
week, he added.
 In other currency pairs, the dollar eased 0.6 percent
against the yen to 76.620 yen, after hitting a two-week high at
77.27 yen on EBS . Orders are seen around 77.50,
traders said.
 Tokyo dealers also reported that macro funds have been
building long dollar positions, and analysts said if the
current euro zone crisis deepened, the yen could weaken against
the dollar, unlike the global financial crisis in 2008.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to a two-year
low and the euro tumbled to its weakest level against the yen
in more than a decade on Monday as growing fears of a Greek
default unleashed anxiety about the impact on the global
economy.
 An admission by Athens that it will miss its deficit target
of 7.6 percent this year reignited the fears over a Greek
default. The price of U.S. crude oil tumbled 2 percent, while a
bid for safety stoked demand for U.S. Treasury debt.
 The major U.S. stock indexes fell around 2 percent, with
financial shares hard hit on a new round of fears over Greek
debt, eclipsing an early boost from better-than-expected U.S.
manufacturing data. For details, see [ID:nN1E7920NX]
 Bank shares were also battered in Europe as investors
feared they may have to make further write-downs on Greek debt
holdings. French-Belgian financial group Dexia  shares
slumped 10 percent as its capital position looked increasingly
stretched by its exposure to Greece.
 Athens, in a draft budget sent to parliament on Monday,
forecast a deficit of 8.5 percent of gross domestic product for
2011.
 ""This news isn't surprising, but if Greece continues to
have problems, that could really drag Europe into recession,
and possibly the U.S. as well,"" said Randall Warren, chief
investment officer of Warren Financial Service in Exton,
Pennsylvania.
 European policymakers appeared no nearer to agreeing on a
definitive solution to the crisis. Officials meeting on Monday
were discussing ways to leverage the bloc's rescue fund and
pressure Greece to implement agreed structural reforms.
[ID:nL5E7L20LD]
 ""Ultimately, Greece would need to see its debt written down
by more and with that you need probably some kind of shoring up
of the banking sector,"" said Alec Letchfield, chief investment
officer at HSBC Asset Management.
 U.S. stocks extended losses in the afternoon. The KBW bank
index <.BKX> fell 3.8 percent, with Morgan Stanley 
shares down 6.1 percent and Bank of America  shares down
8.8 percent. On Friday, stocks closed their worst quarter since
2008.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 191.28 points,
or 1.75 percent, to 10,722.10, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> lost 23.61 points, or 2.09 percent, to 1,107.81.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 62.58 points, or
2.59 percent, at 2,352.82.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2.6
percent to its lowest level since July 2010. The FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> of top European shares ended 1.2 percent lower.
 The October-December period is, traditionally, the best
quarter for equities. Reuters data shows that since 1971, world
stocks have on average risen 3.7 percent in the fourth
quarter.
 Dexia closed 10.16 percent lower after credit agency
Moody's announced a rating review for possible downgrade on
concerns about liquidity. Dexia called emergency board meeting
on Monday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
 Belgian and French finance ministers were also meeting
together with other euro zone leaders on Monday evening. The
Belgian finance minister, Didier Reynders, said the two states,
both Dexia shareholders, would do all that was required to
support their banks. [ID:nL5E7L30GX]
 The euro  hit an 8-1/2-month low of $1.323 on trading
platform EBS.
 Against the safe-haven yen, the euro was down 1.7 percent
at 101.36 yen , its lowest since May 2001 according to
Reuters data.
 ""Euro zone bank issues remain a big issue, and we expect
the euro's downside to continue,"" said George Saravelos, G10 FX
strategist at Deutsche Bank.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
37/32 in price, driving its yield down to 1.7883 percent.
Treasuries prices were also supported by the Federal Reserve's
first bond purchase for Operation Twist, its latest bond
program aimed at helping the U.S. economy.
 U.S. crude oil prices  settled down $1.59 at $77.61 a
barrel, the lowest settlement in more than a year.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday and
the euro slid to an 8-1/2 month low versus the dollar after
Athens admitted it will miss deficit targets this year, making
a Greek debt default look more likely.
 Bank shares were battered in Europe as investors feared the
impact of a Greek default on holders of the country's bonds,
such as Franco Belgian financial group Dexia , whose
stock slumped nearly 10 percent.
 Demand for safe-havens such as U.S. government bonds and
the Japanese yen was on the rise. Treasuries prices were also
supported by the Federal Reserve's first bond purchase for
Operation Twist, its latest bond program aimed at helping the
U.S. economy.
 The 2012 draft budget approved by Greece's cabinet on
Sunday predicted a deficit of 8.5 percent of gross domestic
product for 2011, well over the 7.6 percent target.
 ""There continues to be very little clarity with respect to
a solution (in Europe). More time is needed, and there's no
real driving influence to put money back in the market,"" said
Joseph Cangemi, managing director at BNY ConvergEx Group in New
York.
 European policymakers appeared no nearer to agreeing on a
definitive solution to the crisis. Officials meeting on Monday
were discussing ways to leverage the bloc's rescue fund and
pressure Greece to implement agreed structural reforms. For
details, see [ID:nL5E7L20LD].
 ""Ultimately, Greece would need to see its debt written down
by more and with that you need probably some kind of shoring up
of the banking sector,"" said Alec Letchfield, chief investment
officer at HSBC Asset Management.
 U.S. stocks briefly turned positive after an index of U.S.
manufacturing activity came in better than expected, but Greek
concerns eventually kept Wall Street in the red. On Friday,
stocks closed their worst quarter since 2008.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> lost 28.00 points,
or 0.26 percent, at 10,885.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, at 1,126.53. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 14.09 points, or 0.58
percent, at 2,401.31.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> was 1.5
percent lower, near a 14-month low set in September. The

 By Walter Brandimarte and Natsuko Waki
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - World stocks, oil and
the euro slid on Monday after Athens admitted it will miss
deficit targets this year, making a Greek debt default look
more likely.
 Bank shares were battered in Europe as investors feared the
impact of a Greek default on holders of the country's bonds
such as Franco Belgian financial group Dexia , whose
shares slumped nearly 10 percent.
 Concerns about the European banking sector also sent the
euro to an 8-1/2 month low against the dollar, although it
recovered ground later after the U.S. data release.
 The 2012 draft budget approved by Greece's cabinet on
Sunday predicted a deficit of 8.5 percent of gross domestic
product for 2011, well short of the 7.6 percent target.
 ""This news is disappointing but not surprising,"" said
Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services
in Suffern, New York.
 ""While I think they will get additional help if needed,
there remains a lot of uncertainty over how much more money
could be provided as well as the framework for a possible
deal.""
 Policymakers, however, looked no nearer to agreeing on a
definitive solution to the euro zone debt crisis. Officials
meeting on Monday are discussing ways to leverage the bloc's
rescue fund and pressure Greece to implement agreed structural
reforms. For details, see [ID:nL5E7L20LD].
 ""Ultimately, Greece would need to see its debt written down
by more and with that you need probably some kind of shoring up
of the banking sector,"" said Alec Letchfield, chief investment
officer at HSBC Asset Management.
 U.S. stocks briefly turned positive after an index of U.S.
manufacturing activity came out better than expected, but Greek
concerns eventually kept them in the red. They had closed on
Friday their worst quarter since 2008.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 38.48
points, or 0.35 percent, at 10,874.90, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 4.23 points, or 0.37 percent, to
1,127.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 9.39 points,
or 0.39 percent, to 2,406.01. 
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was 1.5 percent
lower, however, near a 14-month low set in September. The
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> of top European shares fell 1.5
percent.
 The October-December period is, traditionally, the best
quarter for equities. Reuters data shows that since 1971 world

 The euro  fell to fresh 8-1/2 month lows versus
the dollar below $1.33, extending losses, and hitting its
lowest since at least mid -2004 on EBS.

at 102.194 yen  on EBS trading platform, not far
from its decade low of 101.946 struck in September.

 NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro fell to an 8-1/2 month
low against the dollar on Monday, and a decade low versus the
yen, as mounting concerns of a Greek default deepened investor
concern about the euro zone's banking sector.
 With Europe still deeply divided over how to tackle the
spiralling debt crisis and the risks that poses for the bigger
euro zone economies and the financial sector, the euro is
likely to stay under pressure, market players said.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.3325  on
electronic trading platform EBS, having fallen to a low of
$1.33107 -- its lowest since mid-January. Traders cited talk of
option barriers at $1.3300, $1.3275 and $1.3250.
 Against the safe-haven yen, the euro was down 0.9 percent
at 102.205 yen  on EBS, not far from its decade low
of 101.946 struck in September.
 Concerns about cooling global growth prompted both
leveraged and macro funds to unwind positions funded in the
dollar and the yen. As a result, the risk-sensitive Australian
dollar hit a 10-month low at $0.9592 .[ID:nL3E7L30AI]
 ""The economic and financial climate continues to cool and
incertitude will force wary investors to maintain a defensive
posture"" said Jessica Hoversen, fx analyst at MF Global in New
York. ""The U.S. dollar will stay the chief beneficiary of the
dampened outlook for growth and the escalating crisis in
Europe.""
 Moody's put the rating of financial services group Dexia
 on review for possible downgrade with the bank
looking stretched by its exposure to Greece, raising pressure
on its state shareholders to consider a second bailout.
[ID:nL5E7L30GX].
 Euro zone finance ministers are meeting on Monday and are
expected to put pressure on Greece to implement agreed
structural reforms and to discuss options for leveraging the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). [ID:nL5E7L30G0].
 That meeting comes after Greece said it would miss a
deficit target set just months ago. [ID:nL5E7L30G3]
 With the debt crisis showing little sign of abating, the
euro zone's manufacturing contraction deepened in September as
new orders shrank at their fastest pace since June 2009.
 U.S. ISM manufacturing data expected later in the session
is likely to add to economic growth concerns by highlighting a
gloomy outlook for the world's largest economy.
 Tom Levinson, FX strategist at ING in London, said a poor
ISM number would be positive for the dollar in the current
risk-averse environment and could potentially push the euro
below $1.33.
 Investors are also awaiting an European Central Bank rate
decision on Thursday. Some market players are expecting it to
cut rates by 25 basis points and announce fresh liquidity
measures to support the banking sector.
 EURO SHORT POSITIONS
 Speculators have been adding to their bearish bets against
the euro and this trend is likely to continue. [IMM/FX] 
""The market is short euro and rightly so, with fundamental
factors backing it up,"" said Chris Walker, forex analyst at UBS
in London. ""We could see some short term unwinding, but that
will give investors a better level to sell. We expect investors
to continue building short positions against the euro.""
 The options market points to a strong appetite for
long-term euro/dollar puts -- bets that the euro will weaken.
One-year risk reversal spreads  hit a record high
at the end of last week and remain near that level.
 The greenback eased against the yen to 76.79 yen, having
earlier hit a two-week high at 77.27 yen on EBS .
 Orders are seen around 77.50, traders said.
 Tokyo dealers also reported macro funds building dollar
long positions and analysts said that if the current crisis
deepened, this time the yen could weaken versus the dollar,
unlike the global financial crisis in 2008.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - World stocks kicked off the last
quarter of 2011 lower on Monday while the yen and core
government bonds rose as concerns grew over the impact a Greek
default would have on Europe's banks after Athens admitted it
will miss deficit targets.	
 A sharp fall in shares of Franco-Belgian financial group
Dexia , highly exposed to Greek loans, highlighted
concerns about the extent to which a default in Athens would
damage already fragile European banks. 
 The 2012 draft budget approved by Greece's cabinet on Sunday
predicted a deficit of 8.5 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) for 2011, well short of the 7.6 percent target. 
 Policymakers looked no nearer to agreeing on a definitive
solution to the euro zone debt crisis. Officials meeting on
Monday are discussing ways to leverage the bloc's rescue fund
and pressure Greece to implement agreed structural reforms.

 ""Ultimately, Greece would need to see its debt written down
by more and with that you need probably some kind of shoring up
of the banking sector,"" said Alec Letchfield, chief investment
officer at HSBC Asset Management.	
 ""But the problem you would then have is to get the 17 (euro
zone) governments together to agree on something. It is very
difficult to do that ... Until we get a bigger and better
package coming through, trading will remain volatile and often
capped."" 
 The MSCI world equity index fell 1.4
percent, approaching a 14-month low set in September.	
 European stocks fell 1.8 percent with the region's
banking shares down 2.7 percent, while emerging stocks
lost 2.6 percent. 
 The October-December period is, traditionally, the best
quarter for equities. Reuters data shows that since 1971 world
stocks have on average risen 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter.	
 Dexia fell nearly 9 percent after credit agency Moody's
announced a rating review for possible downgrade on concerns
about liquidity. French daily Les Echos said on Friday Belgian
and French finance ministers will meet on Monday to discuss ways
of shoring up the firm's balance sheet.	
 U.S. stock futures were down around 0.3 percent ,
pointing to a weaker start on Wall Street later.	
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.2 percent to $78.24 a barrel.	
 Bund futures  gained 61 ticks.	
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies, while the yen rose 0.3 percent against the greenback

 ""Euro zone bank issues remain a big issue and we expect the
euro's downside to continue,"" said George Saravelos, G10 FX
strategist at Deutsche Bank. 
 ""But the focus will shift to monetary policy and growth this
week. There is a chance that there could be a short squeeze in
the euro in the near term if the European Central Bank does not

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro sank to an eight-month low
on Monday on selling by macro funds and is poised to fall
further after the Greek government said the debt-ridden country
will miss a deficit target set just months ago in a massive
bailout package.	
 Stocks, commodities and growth-linked Asian currencies
ground lower, prompting both leveraged and macro funds to unwind
their long positions in the risk-sensitive Australian dollar,
sending it to a 10-month low at $0.9592 . 
 With Europe bitterly divided over the best cure for the
spiralling debt crisis and with the possibility of a Greek
default looming larger than ever, the euro was likely to keep
falling in the coming days, players said.	
 ""A Greek default is a sort of Pandora's box no one wants to
open. While some markets seem to have priced in such a
possibility, it looks like the euro still has some way to go
should it happen,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at the
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 The euro dived 0.5 percent to $1.3320 from $1.3418 in
New York on Friday. The single currency?lost 7 percent in
September -- the largest monthly drop since November 2010.	
 If Greece defaults on its debt, Ino said he thought the euro
could initially fall to $1.32 and would then quickly move
towards $1.30.	
 Underscoring jitters over European financial institutions'
exposure to Greece, reports emerged that ministers from France
and Belgium would meet to shore up the balance sheet of troubled
financial services group Dexia. 
 Making matters worse, Germany's finance minister ruled out a
higher contribution to the euro zone's rescue fund beyond an
already approved 211 billion euros ($283 billion), while a key
German coalition member of parliament said ""Greece is bankrupt"".

 But traders are afraid to short the euro too aggressively,
as the market is euro short and any positive headline is likely
to trigger a short-covering rally of 100 to 200 points.	
 ""You definitely want to sell the euro into those rallies,
especially if it nears $1.36. Personally, I would sell as low as
around $1.3550,"" said a trader for a Japanese bank. Light
topside stops are seen at $1.3430 with more ahead of $1.3550.	
 For now, technical support for the single European currency
lies at January lows around $1.3250-80 and then in the
$1.3250-00 zone, formed by trend channels, internal wave targets
and Fibonacci projection objectives.	
 The options market points to a strong appetite for long-term
euro/dollar puts. One-year risk reversal spreads
continued to widen and hit a record high around 4.0 at the end
of last week and still stand near that level.	
 ""This suggests some structural need to hedge against
over-exposure to the euro,"" an options trader in Tokyo
said. 
 ECB member Christian Noyer also said it was unrealistic to
expect an increase in Europe's bailout fund beyond what was
agreed in July, but he was open to schemes that would allow
leveraging to expand capacity. 
 Euro zone finance ministers meeting later are expected to
put pressure on Greece to implement agreed structural reforms
and to discuss options for leveraging the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), the currency bloc's bailout fund, to
increase its financial firepower.
 


 BUILDING LONGS	
 The dollar index hit an eight month high, gaining 0.7
percent to 79.092.	
 The greenback also was steady on the yen, after hitting a
two-week high at 77.27 yen and breaking above its 55-day
moving average at 77.17 for the first time since its spike after
intervention on Aug. 4. Stop losses loom around 77.30 yen, while
orders are seen around 77.50, yen traders said.	
 Although the dollar failed to maintain early gains above
77.17 yen, a close above that mark could improve sentiment
towards the pair, especially as seasonal selling before
end-September book-closings by Japanese exporters has run its
course.	
 Tokyo dealers also reported macro funds building dollar-long
positions and analysts said that if the current crisis deepened,
this time the yen could weaken versus the dollar, unlike the
global financial crisis in 2008.	
 ""Contrary to what happened during the global financial
crisis in 2008, this time the yen carry trade has not been as
active,"" said Junya Tanase, chief strategist at JPMorgan Chase
in Tokyo, adding that the dollar may strengthen to 78-79 yen
over the next two weeks, although other yen crosses were likely
to soften.	
 PMI numbers from China and export numbers from Korea suggest
global demand has not eased as quickly as some investors had
feared in recent weeks, but this failed to make much of an
impact on financial markets.	
 The European manufacturing PMI will be released on Monday
and another deterioration below the key 50 level could see the
euro sink further. This is also a big week for U.S. data with
ISM Manufacturing on Monday and non-farm payrolls on Friday.

 By Chikako Mogi	
 TOKYO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks extended losses,
partly dragged lower by a plunge in Hong Kong shares, and the
euro fell on Monday on deepening concerns that the euro zone's
debt crisis will dampen global growth.	
 Worries that a weakening economy will hurt industrial demand
hit commodities such as copper, which extended losses for a
fourth session in a row after its worst quarter in nearly three
years, and oil, which slid more than $1 earlier in the session.	
 Gold rose as investors abandoned riskier commodities,
commodity-linked currencies and equities in favour of the safety
of the precious metal and the dollar.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 3 percent, slipping closer to a 16-month
low hit late in September, while Japan's Nikkei fell 2
percent. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped more than 4
percent in early trade to its lowest since May 2009, with
financials and developers hit hard on fears of the potential
impact of a property market correction.	
 ""The October-December quarter begins today, so there is hope
for domestic fund buying,"" said Fujio Ando, senior managing
director at Chibagin Asset Management in Tokyo.	
 ""But right now the market's focus is Greece's problems and
how Europe will address the situation, as well as U.S. data this
week that will show us more about the economy.""	
 
 Among the first set of clues to help gauge direction for the
global economy in the fourth quarter is the U.S. Institute of
Supply Management index, a component of the broader Purchasing
Managers index that is reported separately, due later on Monday.
 
 As global stocks posted their worst quarter in nearly three
years in July-September, and with mainland Chinese markets
closed all week for national holidays, traders said volatility
might rise with some funds seeking to capitalise on bearish
sentiment in thin volume.	
 
 EURO LOW	
 The euro fell to its lowest level in more than eight months
at $1.3322 in early Asia trade as a government draft
budget figures on Sunday showed Greece would miss a deficit
target set just months ago in a massive bailout package. 
 Adding to the concerns over Greece, the German finance
minister was quoted as ruling out a higher German contribution
to the euro zone's rescue fund than approved by parliament last
week. 
 Euro zone finance ministers meeting later were expected to
put pressure on Greece to implement agreed structural reforms
and also discuss options for leveraging the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), the currency bloc's bailout fund, to
increase its financial firepower. ID:nL5E7L20LD]	
 In commodity markets, Brent crude oil  was down 1.04
percent to $101.69 a barrel, while U.S. crude  fell 1.36
percent to $78.12. 
 Gold extended gains, rising 0.6 percent to $1,632.30
an ounce, after ending the third quarter up 8 percent for its
biggest quarterly gain of this year. Those quarterly gains came
despite a steep drop from a record above $1,920 an ounce in
September. 
 Some equity market players are seeing buying potential in
the recent sell-off, saying any positive news could turn around
the market after this week, when volume is expected to be thin
during Asian trading hours due to the Chinese holidays.	
 ""There is progress in Greece and the EFSF is still making
progress -- they are making baby steps which is positive,"" said
Todd Martin, Asia Equity Strategist at Societe Generale.	
 ""There are signs value players are buying into the market.
Several catalysts could turn the market around,"" he said. 
 While global markets have priced in a U.S. double-dip
recession, global contagion should be contained as long as
Europe makes orderly progress on its problems, he said.	
 A fall in oil prices and a dip in long-term interest rates
would be positive in spurring demand long-term.	
 U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes remained
steady at 1.91 percent in Asia on Monday, after falling 10 basis
points on Friday.

 NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Global stocks closed their
worst quarter in nearly three years on Friday on nagging

 NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Friday and headed for its worst quarter since
mid-2010 as investors fretted over the lack of a credible
solution to Europe's debt crisis, which risks dragging the
continent back into recession.
 Fears of a Greek debt default and its fallout on European
banks accelerated in recent months. That, combined with a
slowing global economy, prompted investors to ditch riskier
currencies such as the euro and Australian dollar and flock to
the safer U.S. currency.
 Analysts said the euro could fall further into year-end,
after weak German retail sales data on Friday highlighted a
grim outlook for euro zone growth. In addition, markets deemed
the latest expansion of the European Financial Stability
Facility insufficient to protect larger states like Italy and
Spain and Europe's banking sector.
 ""The combination of sovereign debt crisis, a slowing
economy and really what appears to be ineffective leadership in
Europe has led to this decline and we expect that to continue
to play out in the fourth quarter,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""We expect the euro to continue to trade to the downside,""
he said. ""Barring any major positive surprises from
policymakers in Europe, a year-end target around a $1.20-$1.25
range is pretty realistic.""
 Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said Friday that Germany's
parliament would not be willing to leverage the crisis fund to
provide enhanced support for stricken euro zone states, a day
after the country approved an expansion of the euro zone rescue
fund. [ID:nL5E7KU0JP]
 The euro  fell 1.1 percent to $1.3445, having hit a
session trough of $1.34263 on trading platform EBS and edging
back toward its lowest in eight months of $1.3360 set on
Monday.
 It is on track for a 7.4 percent decline this quarter and
6.6 percent this month, the biggest monthly loss in 10 months.
 German retail sales fell at their fastest pace in more than
four years in August, suggesting unease about the euro zone
debt crisis prompted some consumers to delay big-ticket
purchases. [ID:nL5E7KU0BD]
 The euro options market shows investors needing to pay more
for downside protection than for the upside, which highlights
concern over a deeper spot fall. 
 Euro zone finance ministers meet next week to discuss more
ways to help Greece, but few in the market are expecting
aggressive measures to isolate other countries should Athens
default on its debts.
 Some investors have speculated about the possibility of a
near-tern interest rate cut by the European Central Bank, but a
higher-than-expected euro zone inflation reading for September
dampened such prospects. [ID:nL5E7KQ2XQ]
 The dollar traded little changed at 76.82 yen .
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.6 percent
to 78.496 <.DXY> and was up 5.6 percent this quarter, the best
performance since mid-2010.
 Month-end demand supported the dollar as market
participants said non-U.S. fund managers needed to buy the
currency after a sell-off in U.S. equity markets this month
forced them to rebalance their currency hedge portfolios.
 The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.6 percent to $0.7659
 a day after ratings agency Fitch cut New Zealand's
credit rating by one notch to AA.
 The Australian dollar  lost 0.6 percent to $0.9720
and was on track for its worst quarter since the end of 2008,
with a drop of 9.3 percent.

 By Sebastian Tong and Emelia Sithole-Matarise	
 LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Friday with
European shares on track to mark their biggest quarterly loss
since the collapse of Lehman Bros three years ago as European
economic readings compounded pessimism over global growth.	
 U.S. stock index futures  pointed to a weaker open for
Wall Street on Friday, with futures down over 1 percent. 
 The euro slipped, on course for its biggest monthly
drop in nearly a year, weighed down by the lack of visible 
 solution to the euro zone's deepening debt woes.	
 The boost to the euro generated by Germany's parliamentary
approval for new powers to the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) proved fleeting after data showing German retail
sales slumping at their fastest pace in more than four years in
August. 
""German retail sales were disappointing, so things are
pointing to a further economic slowdown ahead. On top of that,
the sovereign debt issue is ongoing,"" said Valentin Marinov,
currency strategist at Citi.
 ""To see the euro rebound we have to see more steps taken
towards extending the lending ability of the EFSF and more
efforts to prop up growth.""

 Comments from German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler that
the Bundestag had little appetite to allow the euro zone's
bailout fund to be leveraged to help the bloc's stricken
economies did little to lift the single currency, which fell 0.7
percent against the dollar at $1.3495 having fallen to a day's
low of $1.3486 earlier.	
 ""Short-term, we still have the same prospects: the timing of
a (likely) Greek default, the nature of it, how shared or
otherwise; the uncertainty of whether the (second Greek bailout)
package needs to be revisited,"" said Philip Isherwood, head of
equity strategy, Europe and UK, at Evolution Securities.	
 An unexpected rise in euro zone inflation for September is
also moderating hopes that the European Central Bank would ease
monetary policy to support weakening European demand.

 The deepening economic gloom has prompted investors to slash
bets on risky assets in the quarter to ending September.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 1.7
percent on Friday, on course for its worst quarterly loss since
the months following the collapse of Lehman Brothers three years
ago.	
 The MSCI world equity index fell nearly 1
percent, having dropped more than 16 percent over the quarter,
the biggest drop since the last three months of 2008.	
 Emerging equities have also had their worst
quarter since 2008, down 23 percent between July-September.	
 Asian equities extended their worst monthly performance
since the most volatile days of the global financial crisis in
October 2008. The third consecutive monthly contraction in
Chinese manufacturing sector added to fears of a sharp property
market correction in China, sending the key Shanghai index
to its lowest levels in 2-1/2 years while Hong Kong's
Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.3 percent. 
 The retreat in riskier assets pushed safe-haven German
government bonds higher after five consecutive sessions of
losses as investors rebalanced their portfolios on the last day
of the month and quarter.	
 German 10-year government bond yields were
down 10 basis points at 1.91 percent, tracking benchmark U.S.
Treasury yields which were 6 bps lower at 1.94 percent
.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - European stock index futures
fell on Friday, putting shares there firmly on course to post
their biggest quarterly decline since the months following the
collapse of Lehman Brothers three years ago.	
 Asian equities also dropped, extending the worst monthly
performance since the most volatile days of the global financial
crisis in October 2008. Chinese shares racked up sharp losses
amid fears of a property market correction.	
 The euro fell and was on course for the biggest monthly drop
in nearly a year, with German parliamentary approvals of new
powers for Europe's bailout fund having little lasting impact.	
 ""The euro weakened as strong selling by Japanese exporters
emerged but frankly, looking at the recent volatility, a dip
like that is still not hugely important,"" said Teppei Ino, a
currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. ""The question
now is what is the EU's big, long-term solution to save it.""	
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  futures fell 0.4
percent. Futures for Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40
 fell by similar amounts, while financial spreadbetters
in London called the FTSE 100 to open down as much as
0.6 percent. 
 
 
 Fears of a spiralling European debt crisis and a slowing
global economy that would hit Asian exports caused investors to
slash their bets on risky assets in the September quarter. 
 Markets in Asia, considered by investors to have superior
fundamentals compared with developed markets in the West, were
not immune, with institutional investors continuing to hedge
against further Asian currency weakness, including the yuan.	
 
 CHINA BANKS SOLD	
 Mainland Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong fell 3.8 percent
, underperforming the rest of the region, with investors
selling off bank shares on fears over their exposure in the
event of a property market slump.	
 Stocks in Japan , Australia and Korea
were flat to slightly lower, with only Hong Kong shares
among the major losers, dropping about 2.3 percent, as investors
locked in profits.	
 While window-dressing by fund managers buying some of the
quarter's outperforming issues to improve their books has helped
support shares this week, further gains may be hard to get as
macro concerns remain.	
 ""Window-dressing tends to support the market at the end of
quarter, and some relief about Europe's situation after the
German vote is also giving buyers more confidence,"" said
Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. 
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 1.0 percent after rising for three
consecutive days. For the month, it was down more than 13
percent, its biggest monthly drop since October 2008.	
 U.S. stock futures  were down 0.5 percent after
ringing up decent gains on Thursday.	
 
 BONDS CRACK	
 In what has been another tough month for money managers with
market movements largely dictated by the ebb and flow of
headlines from Europe, emerging market bonds have suffered the
most as investors cut positions to protect portfolios.	
 EPFR Global data shows emerging market bond fund outflows
gathered pace in the week to Sept. 28. A total of $3.2 billion
of net outflows was recorded from emerging market bond funds,
compared with the previous week's outflow of $692 million.	
 Hard currency bond funds saw $1 billion of outflows while
local currency bond funds saw $1.6 billion in withdrawals. 
 In Asia, some of the biggest jumps in bond yields have been
in markets where foreign positioning has been the most crowded
such as Indonesia and Malaysia, while the bustling international
pipeline for bond issuers in Asia has come to a grinding halt.	
 Currencies have also been hard hit. 
 As the flight to safety pushed the dollar higher against
other currencies, investors such as long-only funds and banks
--who bought these bonds on an unhedged basis, betting on more
FX gains -- hurried to hedge positions, further exacerbating
their drops.	
 Even a recent drive by Chinese authorities to fix the yuan's
midpoint higher has failed to impress markets. 
 The renminbi is trading at the bottom end of a
trading end against the dollar and the offshore yuan is
trading at a rare steep discount against the onshore rate.	
 Elsewhere, the euro hovered above a eight-month low
versus the dollar after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's
coalition party voted on Thursday to enhance the European
Financial Stability Facility's powers. 
 Having worked through to $1.3679 at one stage, the single
currency settled back at $1.3556 with investors worried about
the many problems ahead for the euro zone.	
 ""There is still a lot of uncertainty... Economic growth in
Europe and the U.S. is not that good and that will put pressure
on the euro and give a bid to the dollar,"" said Joseph Capurso,
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.	
 Worried investors gave the thumbs up to safe-haven bets like
gold and Treasuries, with the former extending gains by
0.8 percent to around $1,626 per ounce.	
 U.S. crude futures  rose above $82.50 a barrel in
electronic trade on Friday, extending Thursday's gains. Brent
crude  edged above $104 a barrel, but remained on track
for the biggest quarterly drop in 15 months.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
rose in a choppy session on Thursday on upbeat U.S. economic
news and German approval of a stronger bailout fund to counter
the euro zone debt crisis.
 U.S. weekly jobless benefits claims fell to a five-month
low while revised data showed second-quarter GDP grew slightly
more than expected. For details, see [ID:nS1E78S0BT] The jobs
figures assuaged some investor fears that the economy was
headed for recession.
 Germany's parliament overwhelmingly approved the plan
agreed in July to expand the euro zone's bailout fund, averting
immediate disaster, though hurdles still remain to solving the
region's debt problems. [ID:nL5E7KT2WC]
 ""The vote in Germany is obviously positive news and is
exactly what is needed to give the region the go-ahead to
recapitalize their banks,"" said Deirdre Dennehy, portfolio
manager at the Rockland, Massachusetts-based Rockland Trust.
 ""Liquidity is the main problem there, and this will provide
for more liquidity.""
 Wall Street stocks had given up early gains and dropped
sharply, but rallied into the close with volume spiking in the
last hour.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 143.08
points, or 1.30 percent, to 11,153.98. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.INX> rose 9.34 points, or 0.81 percent, to
1,160.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 10.82 points,
or 0.43 percent, to 2,480.76.
 Earlier, the S&P 500 rose more than 2 percent before
falling about 1 percent.
 An index of global equities <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.4
percent and U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures 
gained more than 2 percent.
 Volatility is likely to remain high as markets react to
European headlines and try to gauge the commitment of
governments and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek
debt default that could translate into a global economic
slowdown.
 A rebalancing of portfolio holdings as the third quarter
draws to a close could also keep markets volatile on Friday.
 Markets will shift their focus on Friday to talks between
the European Union, the IMF, the ECB and Greece, as well as a
rescue fund vote in Austria.
 The euro  rose 0.4 percent to around $1.3583, paring
its earlier gains as the New York close drew near.
 ""The impetus from the German vote has waned, leaving the
euro no choice but to come off its highs,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey.
 Despite the latest bounce, the euro has lost more than 5.5
percent against the dollar this month, hammered by mounting
worries over the prospect of a Greek default and bickering
among policy-makers.
 The New Zealand dollar fell against the U.S. dollar after
ratings agency Fitch cut New Zealand's credit rating by one
notch to AA, citing the country's inability to reduce its
current account deficit in the next few years.
 The kiwi, which also traded choppily, pared losses against
the greenback and was last down 0.37 percent at $0.7706.
 U.S. crude futures  jumped 2.3 percent, boosted by
the U.S. data, but copper prices  continued to fall,
adding a 1.1 percent drop to the more than 20 percent rout so
far this month.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - World stocks turned higher in
late trading and the euro lost most of its gains on Thursday
after jittery investors took profits on the day's early gains
on fresh concerns about the European debt crisis.
 Shrinking volume ahead of a religious holiday dried up
liquidity, contributing to the slide in prices.
 Investor focus shifted to talks between the European Union,
the IMF, ECB and Greece and a vote in Austria on Friday after a
relief rally cheered the German passing of a stronger European
bailout fund and better U.S. economic data.
 The troika inspectors are set to comb through new austerity
plans for at least a week. Most analysts expect they will
approve the next tranche of aid, although many expect Greece to
have to default in the coming months.
 ""After gains driven by what was perceived as constructive
news out of the euro zone, if we're concerned that the answer
isn't right around the corner, you're going to see an unwinding
of that trade,"" said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard
Capital Markets in New York.
 ""As much as we started the day on an upbeat tone because of
some mildly positive economic data,"" he said, ""we're now
focusing on the fact that it's going to be a while before we
have answers coming out of the euro zone in terms of their
attempt to rescue Greece.""
 Shortly before the close of trading, the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was up 90.52 points, or 0.82 percent,
at 11,101.42. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up
3.65 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,154.71. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> was down 22.51 points, or 0.90 percent, at
2,469.07.
 Earlier, the Dow and the S&P 500 each rose more than 2
percent.
 An index of global equities <.MIWD00000PUS> reversed course
and was up 0.9 percent, and U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei
futures  gained 0.8 percent.
 Copper prices <.CMCU3> added to their monthly rout, falling
more than 1 percent and more than 20 percent so far in
September. The sharp decline underscores continued worries that
the global economy could return to recession.
 U.S. stocks were earlier lifted by data showing U.S. weekly
jobless benefit claims fell to a five-month low while a
revision showed second-quarter GDP grew slightly more than
expected. [ID:nS1E78S0BT]
 U.S. crude futures  were little changed after giving
up gains of more than 2 percent.
 Volatility is likely to remain high as markets react to
European headlines and try to gauge the commitment of
governments and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek
debt default that could translate into a global economic
slowdown.
 A rebalancing of portfolio holdings as the third quarter
draws to a close could also keep markets volatile.
 The failure to find a definitive solution to the Greek
crisis has led to worries about contagion engulfing bigger
euro-zone economies like Italy and Spain and triggered concerns
about the health of the European banking system.
 Italy paid the highest yield on a 10-year bond since the
introduction of the euro at an auction on Thursday, the first
long-term sale since Standard & Poor's cut the country's
sovereign ratings.
 The euro  rose 0.2 percent to around $1.3555, giving
up a gain of near 1 percent.
 The single currency has lost more than 5 percent against
the U.S. dollar this month, hammered by mounting worries over
the prospect of a Greek default and bickering among
policy-makers.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Thursday as Germany approved an expansion of the euro
zone rescue fund, but the single currency pared some gains as
investors squared positions before month-end.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition party voted to
enhance the European Financial Stability Facility's powers,
joining 10 other countries that have approved an expansion that
would increase the euro zone's firepower to help debt-ridden
countries. [ID:nB4E7KG01O]
 Hopes that policymakers are finally acting to prevent the
debt crisis from worsening have supported the euro in the past
few sessions, lifting it off an 8-month low of $1.3360 set on
Monday.
 But as the New York close drew near, the euro pared its
gains.
 ""The impetus from the German vote has waned, leaving the
euro no choice but to come off its highs,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey.
 The euro  was last up 0.1 percent to $1.35595,
having peaked at $1.36799 on trading platform EBS. It also
gained 0.3 percent to 104.030 yen .
 Optimism that the next tranche of Greece's bailout funds
will be approved also gave support to the euro.
 Data showing U.S. initial jobless benefits at a five-month
low in the latest week and the economy slightly stronger in the
second quarter than previously thought added to demand for
riskier currencies such as the euro and the Australian dollar.
See [ID:nS1E78S0BT]
 CONTAGION RISK STILL ALIVE
 The euro was on track to post its worst month in 10 months
and its worst quarter since mid-2010 against the dollar.
 Analysts said investors were wary of pushing the euro
higher until euro zone officials have a credible plan to
prevent Greece's debt problems from spreading to Italy and
Spain.
 Italy paid the highest yield on a 10-year bond since the
introduction of the euro at an auction on Thursday, the first
long-term sale since Standard and Poor's cut the country's
sovereign ratings. See [ID:nL5E7KT1F2]
 ""The threat of contagion is still very much alive,"" said
Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy at
BNY Mellon in Boston.
 Shankar said his firm's bond flow indicators show
peripheral euro zone debt exposure remains firmly out of favor,
with continued net selling, especially of Italian and Greek
instruments.
 On the downside, traders reported demand from model-based
accounts around $1.3580 with stop-loss orders below. Support is
seen around $1.3485, a 61.8 percent retracement of its advance
to $1.3360 from $1.36909 this week.
 Resistance lies around $1.3715, the 61.8 percent
retracement of its decline to $1.3360 from $1.3937 in the
second half of September. Talk of Asian sovereign supply in the
$1.3700 area could cap any significant gains.
 The dollar  rose 0.2 percent to 76.73 yen, not far
from the record low of 75.941 hit in August on electronic
trading platform EBS. It had earlier risen to a two-week high
of 77.030 yen on EBS.
 Traders said month-end flows and portfolio reallocation
dominated some of the volumes, while a Jewish holiday left some
trading desks thinly staffed.
 The New Zealand dollar fell to the session low against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday after ratings agency Fitch cut New
Zealand's credit rating by one notch to AA.
 Fitch said it is unlikely the country will be able to
sustainably reduce its current account deficit in the next few
years. [ID:nWNA9679].
 The New Zealand dollar was last down 1.1 percent 
at US$0.7655 after going as low as US$0.7650, according to

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Stocks and the euro rose on
Thursday as German lawmakers approved new powers for the euro
zone rescue fund, while a pause in the stream of bad economic
news in the United States further lifted investor sentiment.
 Investors were encouraged as the number of new U.S.
applications for unemployment insurance fell to a five-month
low last week and the economy grew slightly more than
previously reported in the second quarter, suggesting the
world's largest economy can avoid a recession. For details see
[ID:nS1E78S0BT].
 The approval of a beefed-up bailout fund in Germany
appeased markets that have been increasingly worried about
Berlin's commitment to resolving the debt crisis.
[ID:nL5E7KT2K6].
 ""The news out of Germany helped -- that gave (the market) a
lift to start and obviously getting good news on the U.S. front
magnifies that,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment
officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
 Volatility is likely to remain high as markets react to

governments and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek

 Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial

 * Euro retreats after Germany votes for stronger EFSF
 * Euro supported as Greece seen securing more bailout funds
 * Broader threats to euro zone to check euro rallies

 By Neal Armstrong and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The euro retreated from highs
against the dollar on Thursday after support from German
approval for boosting the euro zone rescue fund gave way to
selling given that policymakers still lack a cohesive plan to
solve the region's debt crisis.	
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition party voted to
enhance the Euro Zone Financial Stability Fund's powers, joining
10 other countries that have approved an expansion that would
increase the euro zone's firepower to help debt-ridden
countries.	
 The other six will vote in coming weeks. 
 The euro traded 0.5 percent higher on the day at
$1.3620, still well a above an eight-month low of $1.3360 hit
earlier this week.	
 It retreated from a session high of $1.3679 hit in the
lead-up to the vote, and traders said the euro's early rally
lost steam ahead of big offers suspected around $1.3680-1.3700. 
 Analysts said that while investors were relieved Berlin had
passed the EFSF bill, they were wary of pushing the euro higher
until euro zone officials have a credible plan to prevent
Greece's debt problems from spreading to other countries. 
 ""Beyond this vote nothing has changed and we're awaiting a
more comprehensive response from euro zone policymakers,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ. 
 ""The relief rally in the euro over the past week has been
built on unsustainable foundations."" 
 The euro was also supported on optimism that the next
tranche of Greece's bailout funds will be approved, while there
was speculation of month-end demand from fund managers, who many
believed would rebalance their portfolios by buying euros
following its steep sell-off this month.	
 Meanwhile, talk of Asian sovereign supply in the $1.3700
zone was seen capping any significant gains.	
 ""I'm pretty flat (on my euro position) to be honest,"" said a
trader in London, who had bought the euro earlier in the day,
only to sell it back following the vote announcement. 
 ""I'm not sure where we go from here (on the debt crisis) but
I think the path of least resistance is still lower with any
rallies likely to be sold.""	
 On the downside, traders reported demand from model-based
accounts around $1.3580 with stop-loss orders below.	
 The euro remains short of $1.3715, a key resistance level
that is a 61.8 percent retracement of its decline to $1.3360
from $1.3937. Support is at $1.3475-85, a 61.8 percent
retracement of its advance to $1.3360 from $1.3690. 
 The single currency was still on track to mark its worst
quarter since early 2010, with traders wary over potential for
further falls, on nagging worries over the prospect of Greek
default and constant bickering by European policymakers. 
 This in turn has sparked jitters over contagion to Italy and
Spain and fuelled fears about the sovereign debt exposure of
European banks. 
 The yield on Italy's 10-year bond rose to a new euro
lifetime high of 5.86 percent at an auction on Thursday, as
jitters about the country's public debt pile pushed its
borrowing costs higher. 
 
 BERNANKE'S INFLATION CAUTION 
 The euro rose 0.7 percent against the yen to 104.30 yen
, having bounced from a decade low of 101.90 yen
earlier in the week. Tokyo exporters have been spotted selling
in transactions related to the end of the quarter, but traders
said the majority of them were likely settled by now.	
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent on the day to 76.65 yen,
not far from the record low of 75.94 hit in August. 
 The dollar index nudged 0.2 percent lower to 77.644,
off an eight-month peak of 78.863 struck on Monday, with some
analysts saying its recent safe-haven strength may be undermined
by expectations of more stimulus from the Federal Reserve. 
 In a market fixated on the euro zone debt saga, comments by
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday that the U.S. central
bank may act if inflation falls further drew hardly any
attention. 
 But the comments appeared important as inflation
expectations are already very low. The gap between yields on
10-year Treasury notes and their inflation-protected
counterparts fell to 1.70 percent last week, the lowest since
September 2010.

 * German parliament passes bill to beef up euro rescue fund
 * Clears first of many hurdles towards a crisis solution

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - European shares and the euro
pared modest gains on Thursday as relief from German
parliamentary approval of new powers for the euro zone's rescue
fund proved short-lived and markets refocused on broader
concerns linked to the region's debt crisis.	
 Lawmakers in Berlin backed a beefed-up bailout fund by a
large majority in what was Chancellor Angela Merkel's biggest
test since she took power six years ago, one she passed without
needing to rely on opposition parties.	
 That eased worries of a politically damaging rebellion
against Merkel within the ruling coalition, but pressure on euro
zone policymakers to frame a much stronger response to the
crisis remains acute, amid doubts whether German politicians
have any appetite left to extend the rescue fund even further.	
 ""As expected, the German parliament has voted through the
EFSF,"" said Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners.
""However this is just a step in a very long journey to an (as
yet) unknown destination.""	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was down 0.2 percent at 925.14 points, having risen
immediately after news of the German vote. Their losses also
pulled world stocks as measured by the MSCI index
lower.	
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open on Wall
Street, with futures for the S&P 500 , the Dow Jones
 and the Nasdaq 100  up 0.4 to 0.5 percent.	
 The euro was up 0.5 percent at around $1.3613, but
slipped from around $1.3678 after the bill was passed.	
 
 MORE HURDLES	
 More hurdles towards an effective solution to the debt
crisis remain in place, with the threat of a Greek default very
much on the horizon.	
 Talks between the European Union, IMF and Athens on the next
aid tranche on Thursday will see if Greece has done enough to
avoid running out of cash.	
 Despite the latest bounce, the euro has lost nearly 7
percent against the dollar this quarter, hammered by mounting
worries over the prospect of a Greek default and constant
bickering by policymakers.	
 ""Beyond this vote nothing has changed and we're awaiting a
more comprehensive response from euro zone policymakers,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ. ""The relief rally in
the euro over the past week has been built on unsustainable
foundations.""	
 The failure to find a definitive solution to the crisis has
led to worries about contagion engulfing bigger euro zone
economies like Italy and Spain and triggered concerns about the
health of the European banking system.	
 The German Bund future  briefly fell after the vote
in a volatile trading session but was last higher on the day at
135.92.	
 ""I think it's overly optimistic to think that the whole
crisis is over and therefore the safe-haven status of the Bund
is lost. I wouldn't expect to see the Bund yield much higher
than where we are in the short term,"" said Elisabeth Afseth,
fixed income analyst at Evolution Securities.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The euro gained on short-covering
in volatile, commodity-driven trade after riskier assets bounced
off intraday lows on Thursday, but was still on track to mark
its worst quarter since early 2010, with traders preparing for
further falls.	
 On the day, the euro bobbed up 0.6 percent to a session peak
of $1.3638 , as stocks and commodities were scooped up on
dips after an overnight sell-off, with the rally getting stuck
in a layer of offers at $1.3620-40. Stop losses loom at $1.3650.	
 The euro has lost nearly 7 percent against the dollar this
quarter, hammered by nagging worries over the prospect of Greek
default and constant bickering by European policy-makers over
the response to the crisis.	
 This in turn has sparked jitters over contagion to Italy and
Spain and fuelled fears about the sovereign debt exposure of
European banks that have seen the euro slide 9 cents from above
$1.45 at the end of June, prompting many to think the end of its
decline has yet to be reached.	
 ""It's very clear to me ... sell EUR/USD, it's going down,""
said a trader for a European bank in Singapore, citing the risk
of debt restructuring by Greece and the possibility that the
European Central Bank may cut interest rates.	
 ""My target is around $1.25 in EUR/USD in one month,"" he
said.	
 This view echoed the bearish euro stance of other market
players, with investors continuing to seek refuge in the safety
of the U.S. dollar, putting fresh pressure on battered Asian
currencies such as the Korean won and the Malaysian
ringgit .	
 The euro rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 104.12 yen
, having bounced from a decade low of 101.90 yen
earlier in the week. Tokyo exporters have been spotted selling
in transactions related to the end of the quarter, but traders
said the majority of them were likely settled by now.	
 Demand from Japanese retail players has been cited as
supporting both the euro and the Australian dollar against the
yen. The Aussie gained 0.3 percent to 74.90 yen .	
 News that Finland voted in favour of expanding the powers of
the euro zone bailout fund, agreed in July, is one step forward
in helping combat the region's debt crisis, though the measure
has to be approved by every parliament of the area.	
 Germany's turn is on Thursday and Friday and investors are
growing nervous due to infighting in Germany's ruling coalition.
With the main opposition party supporting the measure, it should
pass comfortably. A failed vote would be a major surprise and
hamper the bloc's ability to prevent a Greek bailout.	
 Analysts also say even if the vote passes there is a
potential downside risk to the euro if German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's leadership is undermined by major dissent within the
coalition. 
 ""You would suspect weakness until Germany votes, given that
it is the big guy that has to fund it,"" said Gavin Stacey, head
of Australia and New Zealand research at Barclays Capital.	
 ""The euro is most likely to continue its trend deterioration
until it gets really bad, forcing a resolution to come,"" he
said.	
 The euro remains short of $1.3715, a key resistance level
that is a 61.8 percent retracement of its decline to $1.3360
from $1.3937. Support looms at $1.3475-85, a 61.8 percent
retracement of its advance to $1.3360 from $1.3690.	
 
 BERNANKE'S INFLATION CAUTION	
 The dollar index nudged 0.2 percent lower to 77.72,
off an eight-month peak of 78.863 struck on Monday, with some
analysts saying its recent safe-haven strength may be undermined
by expectations of more easing by the Federal Reserve.	
 In a market fixated on the euro-zone debt saga, comments by
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday that the U.S. central bank
may act if inflation falls further drew hardly any
attention. 
 But the comments appeared important as inflation
expectations are already very low. The gap between yields on
10-year Treasury notes and their inflation-protected
counterparts fell to 1.70 percent last week, the lowest since
September 2010. 
 ""I feel that the market may gradually wake up to his
comments,"" said Teppei Ino, a currency analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 The greenback was steady against the yen at 76.52 ,
not far from the record low of 75.94 hit in August. The yen has
gained 5.7 percent so far this year.	
 Risk currencies also gained, driven by the rebound in metals
and commodities, with the Aussie advancing 0.6 percent to
$0.9795 .

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 29 (Reuters) - European index futures fell
on Thursday ahead of a vote in Germany's parliament that is
expected to approve new powers for the euro zone's bailout fund,
but also underline the political divisions hampering efforts to
solve the region's debt crisis.	
 The euro bounced and oil and gold prices struggled back into
positive territory, but a widening of corporate and sovereign
credit spreads in Asia signalled that markets remained on edged
before the German vote at 0900 GMT.	
 Japanese shares rose but shares elsewhere in Asia fell,
although losses in the regional benchmark were limited by a 3.7
percent gain for heavyweight Samsung Electronics on
optimism about its third quarter earnings.	
 The past week has seen a broad sell-off of commodities,
equities and emerging markets bonds and a rally in the dollar,
driven by worries that Europe's debt problems will plunge the
world into a second global financial crisis.	
 ""The market situation is still tough, with worries about
global growth,"" said Fujio Ando, senior managing director at
Chibagin Asset Management in Tokyo.	
 
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  futures fell 0.5
percent. Futures for Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40
 were also lower, while financial spreadbetters called
the FTSE 100 to open down as much as 1.1 percent.

 After opening down around 1 percent Tokyo's Nikkei share
average turned around to close up 1 percent. 
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
pared gains to stand down 0.1 percent, although
its materials sub-index remained 1 percent in
the red. 
 S&P 500 index futures  also turned positive to trade
up 0.7 percent, pointing to a firmer start later, after Wall
Street's broad benchmark dropped 2.1 percent on Wednesday. 
 Market sell-offs such as the one that began in late July are
often punctuated by rallies, either due to bargain-hunting by
investors tempted by lower valuations or on ""short-covering"" --
when players realise gains by buying back borrowed stock they
had sold in a bet on falling prices.	
 Portfolio rebalancing was also a factor in play, as money
managers switched funds between markets and asset classes as the
end of the quarter approached.	
 
 GERMAN VOTE	
 While opposition votes will ensure the German bill passes, a
big rebellion within Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right
coalition could weaken her politically and cloud future policy
making at a time when financial markets and other nations are
urging euro zone leaders to act boldly and decisively.	
 ""It seems periods of optimism are getting shorter and the
pessimism is getting longer,"" said David Land, analyst at CMC
Markets in Sydney.	
 ""This is being driven by the clear realisation that while
there are many plans as to how to deal with the Euro situation,
the reality of getting agreement will be that much harder.""	
 The euro bounced 0.6 percent to around $1.3618, with
dealers citing short-covering, while the dollar fell 0.2
percent against a basket of currencies. 
 But the euro has lost nearly 7 percent against the dollar
this quarter, hammered by nagging worries over the prospect of
Greek default and constant bickering by European policy-makers
over the response to the crisis. 
This in turn has sparked jitters over contagion to Italy and
Spain and fuelled fears about the sovereign debt exposure of
European banks that have seen the euro slide 9 cents from above
$1.45 at the end of June, prompting many to think the end of its
decline has yet to be reached. 
 ""You would suspect weakness until Germany votes, given that
it is the big guy that has to fund it,"" said Gavin Stacey, head
of Australia and New Zealand research at Barclays Capital. 
 ""The euro is most likely to continue its trend deterioration
until it gets really bad, forcing a resolution to come.""	
 
 GROWTH EXPECTATIONS	
 Copper , which is highly sensitive to expectations
for global growth, continued its recent decline, trading down
2.8 percent at around $7,046.50 a tonne, although it pared
losses after being down more than 5 percent earlier. 
 Oil futures crawled about 0.1 percent higher, with U.S.
crude  gaining 9 cents to $81.30 a barrel and Brent crude
 up 13 cents at $103.94. 
 Gold , which had seen a shift from a negative to a
positive correlation with riskier assets over the past week or

metal in favour of the dollar and U.S. Treasuries, rose 0.8
percent to around $1,620.95 an ounce. 
 In credit markets, spreads on Asian investment grade
corporate bonds widened, according to an iTraxx measure, while
the cost of insuring Chinese sovereign debt against default
jumped 10 basis points on fears of an economic slowdown.

 Japanese government bonds were in demand for their safe
haven appeal, with the benchmark 10-year yield
falling 1 basis point to 0.995 percent following similar moves
in Treasuries, where the 10-year yield dipped back
below 2 percent on Wednesday. 
 ""Even if the euro zone debt crisis eases, concerns over
global economic slowdown won't fade and this should support
JGBs,"" said a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Commodity prices fell and
stocks ended a three-day rally on Wednesday on anxiety over a
looming German vote to strengthen the fund set up to help the
euro zone combat its debt crisis.
 Infighting in the German ruling coalition turned investors
skittish, as a failed vote would hamper the bloc's ability to
prevent a Greek default that could send the global financial
system into turmoil.
 Market perception that a sovereign default in Europe could
harm the global economy was underscored by a sharp decline in
copper prices, a proxy for growth expectations.
 Global stocks had rallied in the past three days on
optimism Europe was getting a handle on the crisis. But the
drop in stocks and the euro showed markets remain very
sensitive to any signs of a setback.
 An index of world stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> dropped 1.4
percent following its best day in a year and a half. Copper
 fell nearly 7 percent and U.S. crude oil futures 
dropped 4.3 percent. Nikkei futures  fell 0.7 percent.
 ""There has been widespread liquidation across (commodities)
ahead of the German Bundestag lower house vote on Thursday on
whether to back new powers for the euro zone's rescue fund,""
said Phillip Streible, analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
 For the day, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
dropped 179.79 points, or 1.61 percent, to 11,010.90. The S&P
500 <.INX> slid 24.32 points, or 2.07 percent, to 1,151.06. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 55.25 points, or 2.17
percent, to 2,491.58.
 Traders also cited the month-end and quarter-end as a
reason for wild moves in various markets.
 Global stocks were on track to post their worst month in 16
and their worst quarter since the end of 2008.
 The euro zone's sovereign debt issues have dragged on
regional economies and threatened banks across the continent
and beyond.
 European Union and International Monetary Fund inspectors
will return to Athens on Thursday to decide whether the Greek
government has done enough to secure help from its neighbors
and avoid a default. For details see [ID:nL5E7KS0AC].

 Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields dipped back below 2 percent
as demand for government bonds picked up in late trading. U.S.
10-year Treasury  prices fell 4/32 of a point to
yield 1.994 percent.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.3557  after
having earlier hit a one-week high of $1.3690.

 * Investors await speech by Fed Chairman Bernanke
 NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The euro reversed course and
fell on Wednesday, snapping a three-day advance against the
dollar, as investors began to square positions ahead of month-
and quarter-end.
 Earlier the euro strengthened for the fourth straight
session against the dollar on optimism Greece's creditors will
give it bailout funds crucial to avoid a near-term default on
its debt.
 But month-end two-way flows dominated euro price action,
with U.S. corporations and speculators selling the single
currency as central banks bought it, a trader said.
 ""People are probably a little bit long (the euro) and
squaring up ahead of quarter end and Jewish holidays,"" said
Lane Newman, director of foreign exchange trading at ING
Capital Markets in New York.
 In mid-afternoon New York trade, the euro was down 0.2
percent at $1.3566 , off a one-week high of $1.36909
touched in the overseas session in which a U.S. investment bank
was cited as a large buyer.
 The single currency has gained 0.7 percent in the last four
sessions, but with a 5.6 percent slide month to date, the
year-to-date gain is only 1.4 percent.
 Greece remains a focus for investors.
 EU and IMF inspectors return to Greece on Thursday to
decide whether Athens has done enough to secure a new batch of
aid vital to avoid bankruptcy. Germany suggested a new bailout
may have to be renegotiated. For details, see [ID:nL5E7KS0AC]
 Finland on Wednesday voted to grant additional powers to
the euro zone bailout fund, giving support to the euro. The
proposal, which euro zone leaders agreed to in July, needs to
be approved by the parliaments of all the euro zone nations.
 ""Markets remain intensely focused on European developments,
where only slow and tentative progress in addressing the
region's debt crisis is being made,"" said Nick Bennenbroek,
head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
 Fears of a Greek default and its impact on Europe's banking
system are largely behind the euro's September slide.
 Talk of proposals to leverage up the region's 440 billion
euro rescue fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility
-- had buoyed demand for riskier assets this week, though
investors are still cautious about pushing the euro too high.
 Media reports suggest there are still splits within the
euro zone over Greece's bailout terms, highlighting one of the
many hurdles lying ahead for policymakers trying to resolve the
debt crisis. [ID:nL5E7KS00J]

 Wells Fargo's Bennenbroek said news that bans have been

have helped unsettle markets in general and pressured the euro.

 The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 76.458 yen , within
a yen of the record low of 75.941 hit in August on trading
platform EBS and keeping investors alert for Japanese
intervention to weaken the yen.
 Investors awaited a late afternoon speech by Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to see if he offers some reaction
to the market's mostly negative response to last week's
Operation Twist by the U.S. central bank.
 Any hint of even more monetary easing may further boost the
euro to the detriment of the dollar.

 NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher
while caution ahead of an audit of Greece's finances halted a
three-day rally in global stocks on Wednesday.
 The euro held to slight gains and prices of commodities
like oil and copper fell.
 Following its best day in a year and a half, an index of
world stocks dropped as investors awaited news on whether
Greece will be allowed another round of aid in order to avoid a
default.
 The European Union confirmed negotiators would return to
Greece this week to discuss issuing its next tranche of aid.
Investors will remain focused on Europe as the region's
sovereign debt crisis spooks the regional economy and threatens
banks across the euro zone and beyond.
 ""The price action in the markets suggests that the patience
of investors is wearing thin,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
currency research at GFT Forex.
 It has been widely expected that the EU, IMF and European
Central Bank would eventually approve the release of money
Greece needs to avoid default. But after a boost to commodities
and equities in the past days, markets acknowledge the risk is
that optimism has been premature.
 ""It is certainly interesting that we had that nice rally
(in U.S. stocks) yesterday and gave it all back late
afternoon,"" said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.
 ""It just shows how nervous the markets are and it is tough

 Close to noon in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> was up 37.08 points, or 0.33 percent, at 11,227.77. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 0.93 points, or
0.08 percent, at 1,174.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
was down 4.85 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,541.98.
 U.S. stocks were supported by data showing new orders for
long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods slipped less than expected
in August while a rebound in a gauge of business spending
supported views the economy would likely avoid another
recession.
 An index of world stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.5 percent
after rising more than 3 percent on Tuesday --its largest daily
percentage advance since mid-May 2010.
 Equity markets have rallied over the past few sessions on
expectations European officials will aggressively tackle the
debt crisis by boosting the euro zone's 440 billion euro rescue
fund, known as the EFSF.
 But an increase in the EFSF faces opposition in Germany and
there are signs of a split within the currency bloc over the
terms of Greece's next bailout.
 Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields edged above 2 percent before
a $35 billion sale of five-year notes. The less-pessimistic
U.S. data added to hopes for bold steps to combat Europe's debt
crisis, keeping a lid on demand for safe-haven bonds.
 U.S. 10-year Treasury  prices fell 22/32 of a
point to yield 2.056 percent.
 While the euro briefly turned negative against the U.S.
dollar, it was supported by the Greece headlines and by data
showing inflation in Germany ticked up, which should ease
pressure on the European Central Bank to lower rates. The
single currency had previously hit a one-week high versus the
greenback.

 LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Stock markets shrugged off
losses on Wednesday and Wall Street looked set for gains after
the European Union confirmed negotiators would return to Greece
this week to discuss issuing its next tranche of aid.	
 It was the latest in a series of headlines which have not
changed the overall picture in the euro zone crisis, but
underline the jittery nature of markets which are ebbing and
flowing -- often without any clear justification.	
 It has been widely expected that the EU, IMF and European
Central Bank would eventually approve the release of money
Greece needs to avoid default but the announcement added to
hopes of broader progress in dealing with the crisis.	
 ""The market has obviously got enthusiastic about discussions
about the European Financial Stability Fund,"" said Andrea
Williams, fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. 
 ""But we are a long way from it being concluded.""	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.2
percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was
particularly volatile, opening sharply lower but later trading
up around 0.1 percent.	
 Equity markets have rallied over the past few sessions on
expectations that European officials will aggressively tackle
the debt crisis in its peripheral economies, notably Greece, by
boosting the euro zone's 440 billion euro rescue fund (EFSF).	
 Many analysts have stressed markets may be expecting too
much for policymakers to come up with a definitive plan in the
next few weeks, and indeed it is hard to find traders in Europe
who actually subscribe to such a view.	
 An increase in the EFSF faces opposition in Germany and
there are signs of a split within the currency bloc over the
terms of Greece's next bailout.	
 The European index has lost more than 16 percent this year.	
 Japan's Nikkei earlier closed flat.

 EURO LEVELS	
 The euro extended gains, hitting a one-week high against the
dollar, after the Commission announcement.	
 It rose as high as $1.36909, according to EBS data,
surpassing Tuesday's high of $1.3668.	
 ""The market seems to have a belief that Europe is facing up
to the problems and it's risk back on,"" a London-based trader
said.	
 Core euro zone debt was lower with yields rising.	
 Demand for German government bonds in a five-year sale was
weak, although they were sold at a yield of just 1.22 percent

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The yen rose on
Wednesday, buoyed by Japanese fund repatriation and buying by
Japanese exporters, while the euro dipped as investors waited to
see whether European policymakers will push ahead with reforms
to the euro zone's rescue fund. 
 Yen-buying flows ahead of the quarter-end and the end
of Japan's financial half-year gave a lift to the Japanese
currency and weighed on the euro and the dollar. 
 Traders said Japanese exporters were spotted selling
both the dollar and the euro against the yen. Traders also cited
euro selling by Japanese investors repatriating proceeds gained
from coupon payments on their foreign bond holdings. 
 The single currency fell 0.5 percent against the yen to
103.88 yen , paring some of the previous day's gains,
when it climbed 1.1 percent. The euro had hit a decade-low
versus the yen near 101.95 earlier in the week. 
 In addition to the yen-buying flows ahead of the
quarter-end, profit-taking was likely weighing on euro/yen
as well, said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager at Okasan Securities'
foreign securities department in Tokyo.	
 ""There seems to be a fear among market players that it
(euro/yen) will head lower, and so they are eager to sell into
any bounce,"" Soma said.	
 The single currency dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3572
, pulling away from the previous day's high of $1.3669.
The common currency has lost 5.6 percent so far this month but
is off an eight-month low of $1.3360 hit on Monday. 
 Talk of proposals to leverage up the 440 billion euro
bailout fund to multiply Europe's financial firepower lifted the
euro and global equities on Tuesday. 
 Traders cited a Financial Times report that a
split had opened over Greece's bailout terms, in a clear
reminder of the many hurdles laying ahead for euro zone
officials. Dealers suspect the bounce in risky assets on
Tuesday was merely a temporary correction ahead of a fresh
wave of risk aversion. 
 ""Today's rebound could easily give way at some point,"" said
ANZ in a research note.	
 ""We saw a late reversal of some of last night's big risk on
moves on reports that European leaders were not completely
united on the planned policy response.""	
 Offers in the euro were seen around $1.3620 to $1.3650 and
after that at $1.3710, while stop-loss bids were said to be
lurking in the $1.3670 to $1.3680 area. 
 Technically, as long as the euro was stuck below
$1.3670/1.3710 resistance the risk was for a break of
$1.3540/.50 support and, more importantly, $1.3470 for a move to
new lows in the $1.3250/00 area.	
 ""Unless you can predict which euro zone policy maker
will say what and when, it's too scary to trade the euro,"" said
a trader for a Japanese bank in Tokyo. 
 Finland will vote on the enlargement of the EU rescue fund,
EFSF, agreed back in July later on Wednesday, while Germany's
parliament votes on Thursday.	
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.2 percent to $0.9871
, having backed away from the previous day's high of
$0.9986. It struck a 10-month trough of $0.9622 earlier in the
week. Selling by model funds helped drag the Australian dollar
lower, traders said. 
 The U.S. dollar fell 0.3 percent against the yen to
76.56 , not far from a record low of 75.941 yen hit in
August on trading platform EBS. 
 There has been some speculation that Japan could
intervene this week ahead of the end of its financial half-year,
to offer some relief to Japanese exporters, which have been
stung by the dollar's 5.8 percent drop versus the yen so far in
2011. 
 Soma at Okasan Securities said that while
yen-selling intervention may be a possibility, it would probably
only happen if moves in the yen turned particularly violent.	
 ""If the dollar falls below its record low near 75.95 yen,
triggers some stops and the move becomes volatile, I think there
is the possibility of another one-off intervention,"" he said.	
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gives a
speech at 2100 GMT and might offer some reaction to the market's
mostly negative response to last week's Operation Twist. 
Any hint that even more easing is possible could help
underpin risk appetite.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 28 (Reuters) - European stock index futures
fell and the euro dipped on Wednesday, as investors sought more
signs that European leaders were tackling a debt crisis that
threatens the financial system before committing bolder market
bets.	
 Asian shares mostly lost ground and oil and metals fell,
with copper down more than 4 percent, as a rebound in riskier
assets ran out of steam.	
 The dollar rose as money managers sought safety in the U.S.
currency amid signs that a deal on beefing up the euro zone's
rescue fund still faced major hurdles.	
 ""Investors think, isn't the European situation better? But
we have no way of knowing for sure at this point, and until
they're more confident, we probably won't see major buying,""
said Hiroichi Nishi, equity division manager at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc in Tokyo.	
 Plans to increase the financial firepower of the euro zone's
440 billion euro rescue fund face opposition in Germany, while a
Financial Times report said that a split had opened up within
the currency bloc over the terms of Greece's next bailout.

 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  fell 1.3 percent,
pointing to a halt in the rally that drove the euro zone blue
chip index up 13.5 percent since a 2-1/2-year low on Friday.
Futures for Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40 
also fell more than 1 percent, while financial spreadbetters
called the FTSE 100 to open around 1.4 percent lower.

 
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei crawled 0.1 percent higher, while
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was little changed on the day. 
 U.S. stocks rose a little more than 1 percent on
Tuesday, with a sharp pullback late in the session from stronger
gains underlining the fragility of sentiment. S&P 500 futures
 traded in Asia were flat. 
 Turbulence on global markets since late July has been driven
by investors' twin fears of renewed recession in the United
States and the chaos that Europe's sovereign debt crisis could
inflict on the financial system if it continues unchecked.	
 Expectations have risen among market economists that Greece
will be forced soon to default on its massive debts, with
uncertain consequences for both the exposed European banking
sector and other struggling euro zone nations.	
 There is also concern that, while Europe's rescue vehicle
has been able to cope with bailing out Greece, Portugal and
Ireland, its resources would be overwhelmed if a bigger nation
such as Italy or Spain were to need help.	
 
 EURO ZONE RATE CUT	
 The euro eased 0.1 percent to around $1.3562 , having
climbed as far as $1.3665 on Tuesday amid reports that
euro zone policymakers were looking at ways of leveraging the
rescue fund to boost its available funds.	
 The single currency has still lost 5.5 percent so far this
month but is off an eight-month low of $1.3360 hit on Monday.	
 ""Unless you can predict which euro zone policy maker will
say what and when, it's too scary to trade the euro,"" said a
trader for a Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 Currency strategists at RBS lowered their forecast for the
euro through to the end of 2012, citing expectations of an
interest rate cut by the European Central Bank next month that
would narrow the single currency's yield advantage.	
 The yen rose as Japanese exporters sold dollars and euros
ahead of the quarter-end and Japan's financial half-year.
Traders also cited euro selling by Japanese investors
repatriating proceeds gained from coupon payments on their
foreign bond holdings.	
 The euro fell 0.4 percent against the yen to
around 103.83, while the Japanese currency gained 0.3 percent
against the dollar to about 76.56 .	
 The dollar, which along with U.S. Treasuries has supplanted
gold in recent weeks as the asset of choice for safe haven
seekers, rose 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies .

 The firmer dollar hit commodities priced in the U.S.
currency, with U.S. crude oil futures  falling 1.8 percent
to $82.93 a barrel and Brent crude  dipping 0.8 percent
to $106.32. 
 Copper slid more than 4 percent to $7,250 a tonne,
while gold fell 0.5 percent to around $1,640 an ounce.

 ""Currently, gold has positive correlation with commodities
and a negative correlation with the dollar,"" said Ong Yi Ling,
an analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.	
 
 CREDIT WINDOW	
 Credit market players in Asia said a modest improvement in
sentiment could open up a window of opportunity for top-rated
borrowers in the dollar borrowing market, effectively shut in
recent months of fears of a credit squeeze, ahead of the
quarter-end.	
 ""We could see the primary market window opening but it has
to be a certain type of issuer, it wont be open for everyone,""
said a Hong Kong based trader with a European bank referring to
the resumption in debt offerings after drought-like conditions
in the third quarter	
 ""Financials will find it tough, a sovereign type of name or
a frequent issuer like Hutch (Hutchison Whampoa) will be more
accepted.""	
 Japanese government bonds, which have been boosted in recent
weeks by their safe-haven appeal, were flat, with some investors
taking profits after the benchmark 10-year yield
-- steady on the day at 1 percent -- fell as low as 0.965 last
week. 
 ""Investors say they have never had a good time buying
10-year bonds below 1 percent,"" said Koji Ochiai, chief market
economist at Mizuho Investors Securities.

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a third
straight day on Tuesday and oil prices jumped on rising hopes
European leaders will beef up the euro zone's rescue fund and
tackle the region's debt crisis.
 The euro also rose for a third straight day as multiple
reports showed officials considering plans to make its bailout
fund many times larger and to recapitalize banks. For details,
see [ID:nL5E7KR1CV] and [ID:nL5E7KR0T5]
 But volatility yet again ruled the day on conflicting
reports suggesting European officials are considering bold new
action to solve the crisis but there are deep disagreements.
 The sharp focus on Europe will remain as the region's
sovereign debt crisis threatens to sink banks across the euro
zone and bring the regional economy to a halt.
 ""Once we get some resolution of the European sovereign debt
issues, we will regain focus on what's going on in our economic
data stream, and that hasn't been a pretty picture this past
month or so,"" said Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard
Capital Markets in New York.
 U.S. Treasuries prices slipped as demand for safe havens
ebbed, helping the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to rise
back to near 2 percent. [USD/] [US/]
 Stocks on Wall Street were up as much 2 percent most of the
day before finishing just over 1 percent higher as sharp
selling into the market's close showed investors' nervousness.
 The drop in momentum caused global equities, as tracked by
the MSCI all-country world stock index, to narrowly miss their
biggest gains in 14 months.
 Some investors had cautioned about a possible swing in
stocks even as Wall Street surged earlier on Tuesday on
portfolio rebalancing before the third quarter's close and
buying in response to European debt crisis.
 ""All these end-of-quarter issues are amplifying the moves
that we've been seeing in stocks,"" said Paul Simon, chief
investment officer at Tactical Allocation Group in Birmingham,
Michigan. ""I don't have a lot of faith in the moves we've been
seeing.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 146.83
points, or 1.33 percent, at 11,190.69. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 12.43 points, or 1.07 percent, at
1,175.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> finished up
30.14 points, or 1.20 percent, at 2,546.83
 The MSCI all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
settled up 2.85 percent, its highest daily gain in nearly seven
weeks. It was on track earlier for its biggest day since May
2010.
 European shares notched their largest percentage gain since
May 2010 and were on to track for their biggest weekly gain
since July 2009. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top shares gained 4.6 percent to close at 938.38
points.
 Bank stocks featured among the best performers, with the
STOXX Europe 600 banks index <.SX7P> up 6.8 percent. Bank
stocks are still down 30.4 percent so far this year.
 The run-up in stocks followed weekend meetings of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington which signaled
European policy-makers were acting to contain Greece's debt
problems.
 BEWARE OF MORE VOLATILITY
 Some remained pessimistic about progress the euro zone
could make on the crisis.
 ""Nothing has drastically changed. We get conversations
around how we can get out of this mess -- and those are good.
We need those,"" said Michael Sansoterra, portfolio manager of
the RidgeWorth Large Cap Growth Fund in Atlanta, Georgia.
 ""But we've yet to see any concrete action. Actions speak
louder than words, so we'll flail about until we get some
action.""
 Some officials said plans were under way to boost the
assets available to help cut Greece's debts and recapitalize
banks.
 But Germany said there were no plans to increase the size
of the fund for a regional bailout. Berlin faces a key vote on
Thursday to increase the facility's scope. [ID:nLDE78P01H]
 Economic data took a back seat to the events in Europe.
 U.S. consumer confidence remained at depressed levels in
September and a gauge of labor market conditions deteriorated
to its worst since 1983, the Conference Board reported.
 A separate report showed U.S. single-family home prices
were unchanged in July on a seasonally adjusted basis. The data
suggested home prices were stabilizing, though a recovery in
the housing market remains a long way off. [ID:nS1E78Q0I3]
 On the commodities front, U.S. crude oil  settled up
5.3 percent at $84.45 a barrel by 5:00 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT).
 The spot price of gold , which tracks bullion, was up
1.4 percent at around $1,650 an ounce, after rallying to just
shy of $1,677.
 The 19-commodity Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB> climbed
2.7 percent.

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose for a third day
against the dollar on Tuesday, buoyed by hopes European
policymakers are planning to boost a bailout fund, though gains
could be fleeting given investor uncertainty.
 EU officials have said they are studying ways to increase
the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility, a
440 billion euro fund used to bail out Portugal and Ireland,
without increasing the guarantees member states make. For more
see [ID:nB5E7KL00A].
 But talk of coordinated action to contain the euro zone
debt crisis was accompanied by denials from policymakers that
bailout cash would be increased, frustrating some investors.
 ""Uncertainty remains high with Finland voting on the new
EFSF2 tomorrow and Germany on Thursday,"" said Camilla Sutton,
chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""For
the market is it increasingly important that these votes are
passed and that Slovakia also supports the new vehicle.""
 The euro could retrace more of this month's losses if the
expanded rescue fund is passed, if there is an agreement as to
how it will be used and if a plan is put in place for an
orderly restructuring of Greek debt, she said.
 In mid-afternoon New York trading, the euro rose 0.7
percent against the dollar  to $1.36230, well above an
eight-month low of $1.33600 hit on Monday. At the session peak
of $1.3669 on Tuesday, it was the highest since Sept. 21.
 The euro's move higher coincided with comments from
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel saying Germany wants a
strong Greece. [ID:nL5E7KR3G5]
 The euro also climbed to its highest against the yen since
Sept. 21 with a peak of 104.963 yen. It last traded at 104.421,
up 1.1 percent on the day.
 However, officials once again appeared to contradict
optimists on chances of a euro zone rescue deal.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Tuesday
that raising the euro zone bailout fund is a ""silly idea,"" and
would mean some of the economies within the region could lose
their AAA rating. [ID:nB4E7HT00X]
 When talk of leveraging the European Financial Stability
Facility first became public last week credit rating agency
Standard & Poor's warned that such a move could trigger ratings
downgrades for Germany and France. [ID:nW1E7JUO2F]
 Spain's economy minister Elena Salgado also downplayed the
rescue fund speculation, saying plans to extend the region's
EFSF bailout fund to two trillion euros were not on the table.
[ID:nL5E7KR0TO]
 She also tempered expectations of radical and swift action
by European policymakers to contain the debt crisis.
 Nevertheless, a glimmer of hope for the euro zone crisis
and the fact policymakers may have a firmer grip on it bode
well for risk tolerance. Stocks rallied as U.S. Treasuries and
German Bunds fell. [ID:nS1E78P1Q8]
 Scotia expects the euro to retrace some of its losses into
year-end, but it will not rise to new highs, Sutton said.

 The euro remains vulnerable to declines and some investors
are ready to sell into any rally given the euro has just moved
from oversold territory as measured by the 14-day exponential
relative strength index.
 ""The near-term rebound in the euro/dollar may continue to
gather pace as the EU increases its effort to restore investor
confidence,"" said David Song, currency analyst at DailyFX. Yet,
the ""euro/dollar may resume the downward trend carried over
from the previous month as the fundamental outlook for Europe
remains bleak.""
 The strategy to sell into a bounce in the euro was
widespread as doubts persisted over policymakers' ability to
craft a plan quickly to deal with the escalating crisis.
 Higher-risk growth-linked currencies also rebounded after a
recent sharp sell-off. The Aussie dollar  was up 1.2
percent against the U.S. dollar at US$0.9948. The Kiwi dollar
 gained 1.5 percent to US$0.7914.
 The U.S. dollar traded 0.5 percent higher at 76.711 yen
 but was still less than a yen from the record low of
75.941 yen set last month, keeping intervention from the Bank
of Japan to stem the Japanese currency's gains high on radar
screens. The yen has strengthened 5.5 percent so far this
year.

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world
exchanges were headed for their largest daily gain in 16 months
on Tuesday and commodities also jumped on rising hopes that
European leaders will beef up the euro zone's rescue fund and
tackle the region's debt crisis.
 The euro rose for a third straight day and oil prices rose
almost 5 percent as European officials were seen considering
plans to increase the size of its bailout fund and to
recapitalize banks. For details, see [ID:nL5E7KR1CV] and

Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global

avoided.""
 Equities also were boosted as investors rebalanced their
portfolios in the last days of the quarter. The wide gap in
performance between equities and bonds, favoring government
debt so far this quarter, may partly reverse. [ID:nS1E78P1Q8]
 U.S. stocks rose for a third straight day, gaining more
than 5 percent since Thursday, for the biggest three-day gain
in six weeks.
 By 12:48 p.m. EDT (1648 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 258.95 points, or 2.34 percent, at

 The rally followed expectations built over the weekend from
meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington,
D.C., which signaled European policymakers were acting to
contain Greece's debt problems and resolve a crisis threatening
to engulf the world economy.
 CAUTION OF MORE VOLATILITY
 Even so, some cautioned that markets could remain volatile
as traders closely watch headlines to track the level of

prevent a Greek default.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose for a third
straight day against the dollar on Tuesday, bolstered by
speculation policymakers were planning to boost the region's
bailout fund, although gains could prove short-lived.
 European officials on Tuesday poured cold water on the
idea of expanding the bailout fund, frustrating investors eager
for a lasting solution to the euro zone's debt drama.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, for instance,
said on Tuesday that raising the euro zone bailout fund is a
""silly idea,"" and would mean some of the economies within the
region could lose their AAA rating. See [ID:nB4E7HT00X].
 Spain's economy minister Elena Salgado also downplayed the
rescue fund speculaton, saying plans to extend the region's
EFSF bailout fund to 2 trillion euros were not on the table.
[ID:nL5E7KR0TO]. She also tempered expectations of a radical
and swift action by European policymakers to contain the
worsening debt crisis.
 ""The euro is benefiting from optimism that European
officials are close to getting a handle on the euro zone debt
crisis. This has also led to broad gains in stocks,"" said Joe
Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Travelex Global Payments in
Washington.
 ""But it remains vulnerable to declines and investors are
still cautious.""
 In early New York trading, the euro rose 0.7 percent on the
day against the dollar  to $1.36405, way above an
eight-month low of $1.33600 hit on Monday.
 Oscillators such as the relative strength index suggested
the euro may be near oversold territory, while traders said
investors were still looking to sell the euro on any rally.
 ""A lot of investors are looking to reset new short euro
positions around $1.36,"" said Niels Christensen, currency
strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The strategy to sell into a bounce in the euro was
widespread as doubts persisted over policymakers' ability to
craft a plan quickly to deal with the escalating crisis.
 Higher-risk growth-linked currencies also rebounded on
Tuesday after a recent sharp sell-off, helped by firmer
equities. The Aussie dollar  was up 1.0 percent against
the U.S. dollar at US$0.9950 and the Kiwi dollar 
gained 1.5 percent to at US$0.7920.
 The U.S. dollar traded 0.2 percent highs at 76.530 yen
, hovering close to record lows around 75.94 yen and
keeping alive concerns that Japan could intervene again to stem
its currency's gains. The yen has strengthened nearly 6 percent
so far this year.

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets
were headed for their largest daily gain in 16 months on
Tuesday, and oil and gold prices rallied too, as improving
sentiment over the European debt crisis helped markets rebound
from last week's selloff.
 The U.S. dollar fell against the euro for a third straight
day. U.S. Treasuries prices also slipped, with 30-year bonds
down by over two full points, as demand for safe-havens ebbed.

 ""The market is beginning to get the feeling that finally
European lawmakers are moving out of their paralysis,"" said
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global
Capital in New York.
 ""Commodity prices are up across the board. There's hopes a
global recession can be avoided.""
 Stocks rose for a third straight day. By 9:43 a.m. EDT
(1343 GMT), Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
was up 207.64 points, or 1.88 percent, at 11,251.50. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 20.91 points, or 1.80
percent, at 1,183.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up
36.55 points, or 1.45 percent, at 2,553.24.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
up 3.2 percent, on track to its largest daily gain since May
2010. For the week thus far, the index is up 4.3 percent, after
dropping more than 7.0 percent last week.
 The broad-based rebound follows expectations built over the
weekend from meetings of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington D.C. which signaled European policymakers were
acting to contain Greece's debt problems and resolve a crisis
threatening to engulf the world economy.
 Some officials have said plans were underway to boost the
size of a regional bailout fund to cut Greece's debts and
recapitalize banks, although others have underlined they these
were at a very early stage. Germany has also said there are no
plans to increase the size of the fund. [ID:nLDE78P01H]

both pessimism and optimism. The optimists have taken the
forefront on hopes that we could see European politicians

weeks,"" said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
""But there are still a lot of concerns. Investors remain
sceptical.""
 U.S. crude oil  jumped almost 4 percent to above $83
per barrel. The spot price of gold , which tracks
bullion, rose 1.7 percent to above $1650 an ounce. The

 LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - World stocks rose strongly for a
third straight session of gains on Tuesday with European shares
bouncing up 3 percent as investors bet that officials would add
to measures to calm the euro zone debt crisis.	
 Wall Street also looked set for strong gains at the open to
follow Monday's rise. Emerging markets gained more
than 4 percent.	
 Yields on long-term core euro zone bonds shot up.	
 After losing more than 7 percent last week, the MSCI
all-country world stock index was up 1.8 percent
for a more than 2.5 percent rebound so far this week.	
 The trigger has been rising expectations following weekend
meetings of the International Monetary Fund that European
policymakers will act to contain Greece's debt problems and
resolve a debt crisis that threatens to do serious damage to the
world economy.	
 Some officials have said that plans are underway to boost
the size of a regional bailout fund to cut Greece's debts and
recapitalise banks, although others have underlined they are at
a very early stage and Germany has said there are no plans to
increase the size of the fund.	
 ""Given so much uncertainty at the moment, there is room for
both pessimism and optimism. The optimists have taken the
forefront on hopes that we could see European politicians
getting to grips with the current situation over the coming
weeks,"" said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. 
""But there are still a lot of concerns. Investors remain
sceptical.""	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 3
percent after rising 1.8 percent on Monday.	
 Japan's Nikkei gained 2.8 percent.	
 
 EURO FLAT	
 The relative bullishness did not spill over onto foreign
exchange markets, where the euro was flat.	
 ""Any indication that European politicians will take
fundamental steps to contain the debt crisis is positive for the
euro, but we have had so many disappointments and this is not
something that can be fixed overnight,"" said Niels Christensen,
currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.	
 The euro was at $1.3529 , just above an 8-month low.	
 The dollar was lower against a basket of currencies .	
 Core euro zone debt prices were lower as the stock markets
recovered. They have been rising sharply in a risk aversion
trade.	
 The 10-year Bund yield rose 10 basis points.	
 But eyes remained on the debt-strapped periphery.

 Italy paid 3.071 percent to sell 8 billion euros of
six-month Treasury bills, the highest since September 2008 and
above Spain's 2.665 percent.	
 The Spanish sale of three- and six-month bills totalled 3.2
billion euros, above the mid-point of a 2.5 billion euro to 3.5
billion euro target.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - European stock index futures
rose sharply on Tuesday, after Asian shares rebounded from
multi-month lows and as the euro clung to gains on hopes that
euro zone officials will act to corral Greece's debt woes and
prevent a financial meltdown.	
 Financial stocks and global miners were among the biggest
gainers in Asia, although some market players cautioned against
undue optimism that European leaders were finally getting to
grips with a protracted solvency and liquidity crisis.	
 ""It's a knee-jerk reaction to the world failing to come to
an end last night,"" said Richard Morrow, director at
Melbourne-based private client stockbroker E.L. & C. Baillieu.
""It is a reversal and I don't see it lasting. The market has
been as gloomy as I can remember since the last days of 2008.""	
 After three sessions of steepening falls and wild swings on
commodities markets, oil, copper, gold and silver all rose. U.S.
crude jumped nearly $2 a barrel.	
 The dollar, U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds,
currently safe haven assets of choice, all eased.	
 
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  futures rose 2.7
percent. Futures for Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40
 also rose more than 2.5 percent, while financial
spreadbetters called the FTSE 100 to open up as much as
2.2 percent. 
 Turbulence on global markets since late July has been driven
by investors' twin fears of renewed recession in the United
States, and the chaos that Europe's sovereign debt crisis could
inflict on the financial system if it continues unchecked.	
 European Central Bank policymakers said on Monday that
officials were working to increase the firepower of the region's
rescue fund in their latest effort to staunch a crisis that U.S.
President Barack Obama said was ""scaring the world"".

 U.S. markets reacted positively, finishing more than 2
percent higher on Monday , and the mood continued
in Asia, where Tokyo's Nikkei rose 2.8 percent, coming
off its lowest close in more than two years. 
 S&P 500 index futures  rose 0.4 percent.	
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 4.5 percent, after plumbing its lowest
level in 16 months on Monday. The index is down 26 percent from
its 2011 high in April.	
 UBS analysts said fund flow data showed foreign money
managers had pulled money out of Asia ex-Japan markets last week
and predicted more selling by funds looking to send money back
to Britain, the United States and Europe.	
 
 RATE REVERSAL	
 Expectations have been rising among market economists that
Greece will be forced soon to default on its massive debts, with
uncertain consequences for both the exposed European banking
sector and other struggling euro zone nations.	
 There is also concern that, whilst Europe's rescue vehicle
has been able to cope with bailing out Greece, Portugal and
Ireland, its resources would be overwhelmed if a bigger nation
such as Italy or Spain were to need help.	
 Senior ECB officials confirmed the 440 billion euro rescue
fund would likely be increased in size, and there were also
hints from policymakers that the central bank could cut interest
rates next month, reversing a hike earlier this year in a move
already expected by markets. 
 ""Markets are getting more confident around some action plan
in Europe, which is positive, but on the other side, markets are
also looking for more policy easing from the ECB, which is
negative,"" said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS in
Sydney.	
 ""The combination of both will leave the euro caught in the
middle somewhere.""	
 The single currency traded around $1.3545, up about
0.1 percent on the day, after rallying from an eight-month low
of $1.3360 on Monday. The dollar eased 0.6 percent against a
basket of currencies . 
 
 JGBs LOWER	
 Gains in equities and other riskier assets knocked Japanese
government bonds lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield
rising 2 basis points to 0.995 percent. 
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged up to
1.907 percent, having risen from a more-than-60-year low at
1.674 percent last Friday. 
 The improved sentiment also helped credit markets, with
spreads tightening on the iTraxx benchmark index of investment
grade Asia ex-Japan corporate bonds. 
 Commodities were helped by a weaker dollar, which makes
assets priced in the U.S. currency cheaper for holders of other
currencies.	
 Brent crude oil  rose 1.4 percent to $105.41 a barrel
and U.S. crude  gained 2.3 percent to $82.06. 
 ""Clarity on the euro zone plan is still key, crude prices
are swinging back and forth depending on what comments come out
of Europe,"" said Victor Say, an analyst with Informa Global
Markets in Singapore. 
""Commodities have also been boosted by a weaker dollar and
short covering after the recent sell-down.""	
 Copper , which ended Monday up 2 percent after
falling more than 6 percent at one stage, rose another 2 percent
on Tuesday to $7,409.75 a tonne. 
 Gold, which has been hammered in recent days by selling by
hedge funds to cover losses elsewhere in portfolios, rose 1.3
percent to around $1,648 an ounce.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2011 03:56AM ET</span>",FOREX-Euro crawls up on hopes for enhanced bailout fund," * Euro off 8-month low on report of plan to enhance bailout
fund
 * Expectations of ECB rate cut seen undermining euro longer
term
 * Risk currencies bought back as liquidation in Asian
currencies fades
 * Wariness about Japan intervention keeps yen in check

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The euro crawled up from
eight-month lows on Tuesday as a report that Europe is
considering beefing up its bailout fund prompted short-covering,
and it could extend its rebound in the very near term given
traders' overwhelmingly short positions in the currency.	
 Asian currencies also rebounded after massive selling in the
past two weeks, helping to ease worries about growing contagion
from the euro zone's debt crisis to the world economy and
supporting the euro and other risk currencies.	
 But the euro remained vulnerable to persistent doubts over
policymakers' ability to craft a plan quickly to deal with the
crisis. Growing expectations that the European Central Bank will
likely cut interest rates as early as next month are also
expected to undermine the currency in the longer term.	
 ""Markets are getting more confident around some action plan
in Europe, which is positive, but on the other side, markets are
also looking for more policy easing from the ECB, which is
negative,"" said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS in
Sydney.	
 ""The combination of both will leave the euro caught in the
middle somewhere.""	
 The euro traded at $1.3543 , flat from late U.S.
levels but holding above an eight-month low of $1.3360 hit on
Monday. Oscillators such as the relative strength index show the
currency is near oversold territory.	
 Elliott wave analysis also suggested that the euro could be
completing a five-wave decline from $1.4545 on Aug. 29 with the
drop to Monday's low, opening way for a corrective rebound.	
 Data from the U.S. financial watchdog also showed that
speculators' net euro short positions at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange last week were at the highest level since June last
year.	
 Resistance looms at $1.3580, a 38.2 percent retracement of
its Sept. 15-26 decline, but a break of that level is likely to
trigger some stop-loss buying and could see a rally to $1.3648
and $1.3716, 50 percent and 61.8 percent retracements of the
same decline.	
 The euro stood at 103.38 yen , having bounced from
a fresh decade low of 101.90 yen hit on Monday, weathering some
month-end selling from Japanese exporters.	
 The latest catalyst for the euro's rebound was a CNBC report
that European officials are considering setting up a special
purpose vehicle to buy distressed debt from banks to magnify the
firepower of the region's rescue fund.	
 ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said in New
York on Monday that the existing 440 billion euros in the
bailout fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility
(ESFS), could be used as collateral to borrow from the European
Central Bank, making more money available for crisis fighting.
 
 Some market players say such a scheme could help the euro
zone fend off further deterioration in the euro zone's debt
woes.	
 ""CDS spreads for countries such as France and Germany are
rising while those for Southern countries have fallen, with the
exception of Greece. This may be telling us that markets may be
thinking that the worst part of crisis could be over for most
(troubled) countries except for Greece,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank.	
 
 EURO ZONE UNCERTAINTY	
 Still, traders remained nervous about whether the 17 country
currency bloc could form a united front to fix its debt problems
given its history of internal disagreements. This week alone,
the euro zone faces plenty of hurdles, including votes this week
in Finland and Germany on the earlier EFSF structure. The Greek
government votes Tuesday on new austerity measures needed to
secure aid. 
 The trader at the Japanese bank also said that many
investors are not active in the euro because of uncertainty over
the debt crisis, making the euro's moves choppy.	
 ""Apart from European repatriation and sovereign players'
orders, trade is becoming limited as investors want to avoid
risk in light of uncertainty over policy,"" he added.	
 The euro could be hurt by growing expectations of a rate cut
by the ECB as some ECB officials said on Monday that cuts could
not be ruled out, lifting European shares. 
 ""Rate cuts will be negative for the euro in terms of yield
attraction. If a rate cut helps to shrink credit spreads, that
could be considered as a positive for the euro but I think over
time it will have an adverse effect,"" said Koji Fukaya, chief
strategist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.	
 Risk currencies also rebounded a tad after a wild selloff in
the past two week, with the Aussie bouncing back to
$0.9880, from a 10-month low of $0.9622. Most Asian currencies
stabilised, with the Korean won trading at 1,171.3 won per U.S.
dollar , off a one-year low around 1,196.0.	
 The dollar index edged down 0.4 percent to 77.86,
after hitting an eight-month peak of 78.863.	
 The dollar remained stuck against the yen at 76.36 ,
though traders reported growing talk Japan could intervene this
week ahead of the end of their financial half-year. The yen has
gained nearly 6 percent so far this year.	
 Early on Tuesday, Japan's government said it wants to bring
forward steps to ease the pain some companies feel from a
stronger yen and enact the measures before it completes an extra
budget to fund reconstruction spending.

But enthusiasm for the greenback was tempered by remarks from European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot, who was quoted in a Dutch newspaper saying that Greek default could no longer be ruled out.
“All efforts are aimed at preventing this, but I am now less certain in excluding bankruptcy than I was a few months ago,” Knot, who heads the Dutch central bank, told Reuter’s news.

981,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2011 07:39PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD rises in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro moved higher against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Thursday, following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to implement a USD400 billion debt-swap program in an effort to ward off economic recession.
EUR/USD hit 1.3601 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3582, rising 0.13%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3500, last Monday’s low, and resistance at 1.3882, last Friday’s high.
At the conclusion of its two-day Federal Open Market Committee Meeting Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would be replacing a portion of the short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in a move known as “Operation Twist.”
The move was highly anticipated by the market and may lead to lower interest rates as well as avoid the resumption of its controversial money creation program.
“There are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets,” the Fed said in a statement, with a reference to the ongoing debt crisis in the euro-zone.
The Fed voted to leave its benchmark interest rate at near zero through the middle of 2013, a rate that has been in place since December of 2008.
Global equity investors looking for more beyond the expected “twist” sent European shares lower in Wednesday’s session, with France’s CAC 40 falling 1.61% to 2,935.82, Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 1.4% to 5,3288.41, and Germany’s DAX surrendered 2.47% to end the session at 5,433.80.
Earlier Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose by 7.7% to a seasonally adjusted 5.03 million units in August, well above market expectations of a 1.7% gain.
The figures did little to spark buying enthusiasm on Wall Street. as the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.49% to 11,124.84, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.01% to 2,538.19, and the S&P 500 slumped 2.94% to close at 1,166.76.
Meanwhile, the euro was higher against both the British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP up by 0.02% to hit 0.8759, and EUR/JPY adding 0.19% to hit 103.96.
The U.S. Department of Labor was due to release weekly figures on initial jobless claims later Thursday."

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Global equities rose for a
fourth straight day on Friday, but the euro slid as hope Europe
was finally getting a grip on the region's debt crisis was
offset by lingering fears Greece is still at risk of default.
 The Nasdaq stock market posted its biggest weekly advance
since July 2009, and gains elsewhere in global equity markets
suggested risk aversion has dissipated.
 The euro  headed for its best week in eight against
the U.S. dollar, even as it slipped 0.7 percent to $1.3785 on
Friday. The announcement on Thursday that the world's leading
central banks will boost short-term dollar funding for European
banks facing a dollar shortage buoyed the euro.
 ""The market seems to be a little bit more reassured that
(their) support will not allow for major disruption in Europe,""
said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at
Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland, which
manages about $14.8 billion in assets.
 A sharp decline in French and Italian banking stocks, along
with the euro's slide, showed caution still lingers despite
encouraging signs of growing efforts to resolve the debt
crisis.
 But even though central bank support for funding European
banks eased fears that Greece's fiscal woes might bring down
the financial system in Europe, no one suggested the crisis was
fully resolved.
 ""There is still a lot of open-ended issues out there, which
means this situation will remain pretty fluid,"" said Mark
Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott in Philadelphia.
 ""All of what we just gained in the last five trading
sessions could be given back,"" Luschini said, referring to Wall
Street, whose rally has surpassed by a day the rally in
European stock markets.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 75.91

In afternoon U.S. trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.62% to hit 1.3791.
Speaking from a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers in Poland Friday, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said a decision on the next round of Greek aid would be made in October.

Also attending the meeting was U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who urged finance ministers to work together with the European Central Bank to address the region’s debt crisis and embellish the power of the current rescue fund.
Earlier Friday, the University of Michigan released its report on U.S. consumer sentiment showing a more-than-expected gain to 57.8 in August, up from 55.7 in the previous month. Economists had forecast the index to hit 56.0 last month.
Wall Street shares were on track to add gains for the fifth consecutive day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.51% to 11,491.40, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.31% to 2,615.19, and the S&P 500 advanced 0.3% to trade at 1,212.71.

The dollar was higher against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY advancing 0.2% to hit 76.86, and USD/CHF higher by 0.72% to hit 0.8756. 
The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD down 0.36% to hit 0.9800, AUD/USD up 0.34% to hit 1.0363, and NZD/USD rising 0.67% to hit 0.8290.

 NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Global equities rose for a
fourth straight day on Friday but the euro slid as optimism
European leaders are getting a grip on the region's debt crisis
was offset by fears that Greece was still at risk of default.
 While gains in the equity market suggested risk aversion
has dissipated, a sharp decline in French and Italian banking
stocks, along with the euro's slide, indicated caution was
still strong in markets.
 Fears that Greek fiscal woes would bring down the European
financial system had eased on Thursday after the world's
leading central banks agreed to boost short-term dollar funding
for banks in Europe that have faced a dollar shortage.
 ""There's a view that the global leaders are coming up with
a plan for a soft landing on Greece,"" said Scott Graham, head
of Treasury trading at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago.
 Even so, some equity traders said there were expectations
that credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service might cut
Italy's debt rating after the market close, sentiment that
dragged on bank shares.

1108,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 16, 2011 12:06PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD falls in early U.S. trade,"Investing.com - The euro moved lower against the U.S. dollar in early trade Friday, as investors looked to a meeting of European policy makers for details of a planned rescue fund to aid debt-threatened euro-zone members.
EUR/USD hit 1.3754 in early U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since Tuesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3784, falling 0.68%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3500, Monday’s low, and resistance at 1.3937, Thursday’s high.
Speaking from a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers in Poland Friday, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said a decision on the next round of Greek aid would be made in October.
Juncker added that officials had made progress on Finland’s insistence that it be provided collateral in return for participation in a second Greek bailout.
Also attending the meeting was U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who urged finance ministers to work together with the European Central Bank to address the region’s debt crisis and embellish the power of the current rescue fund.
European markets gained on the day; in late Friday trade France’s CAC was up 0.31% to 3,055.25, Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 1.04% to 5,392.97 and Germany’s DAX was higher by 2.3% to 5,635.14.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The euro dropped on Friday,
as investors locked in profits after this week's rally sparked
by global central bank action to boost liquidity, and could
stay weak on any negative news coming out of an EU finance
ministers' meeting.
 Analysts said investors also sold the euro, pushing it to
session lows against the dollar, after the Bank of Portugal
said the Portuguese island of Madeira failed to report
information about debts from previous years that amounted to
0.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2010.
[ID:nLDE78F07C].
 ""We had a pretty good run-up in euro/dollar the last couple
of days from $1.37 to $1.39 because of positive news this week.
So we've had a bit of a short squeeze,"" said Ray Attrill,
senior currency strategist, at BNP Paribas in New York.
 However, he added that market players remained bearish on
the euro and those expecting any new policy initiatives from
the European Union finance minister's meeting will be
disappointed.
 The euro was last down 0.5 percent at $1.38081 ,
off a one-week peak of $1.39370 hit on Thursday but held above
a seven-month trough below $1.35 plumbed on Monday. The euro
has gained around 1.8 percent so far this week, its best weekly
performance since the week of July 24 on trading platform EBS.
 It fell to a session low of $1.37530, with traders saying
it extended losses after stop-loss orders were triggered on the
break of $1.37700, with more stops at $1.37500.
 Overall though investors were reluctant to take large
positions ahead of the outcome of an EU meeting in Poland, at
which Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is a participant.
 Geithner told EU finance ministers on Friday they should
end loose talk about a euro zone break-up and work more closely
with the European Central Bank to tackle the debt crisis. He
also said Europe would not see similar global financial
coordination as there was in 2009, but that Washington would do
what it could to help. For more, see [ID:nL3E7KG0KC].
 Technical charts indicated the euro could find support
around $1.3738, the 23.6 percent retracement of the fall from
$1.45500 on Aug.29 to $1.34949 on Sept.12.
 The euro had hit a one-week high after a coordinated move
by central banks on Thursday to provide dollars. Funding
strains, evident through the cross currency basis swap market,
which had hit some euro zone banks, including large French
banks and were impacting the euro, had appeared to be easing.
 The three-month euro/dollar cross currency basis swap
, or the relative premium for swapping euro
LIBOR for dollar LIBOR tightened to around minus 88 basis
points from on Friday, a day after the action from global
central banks. It narrowed from as wide as minus 115 basis
points on Monday.
 Wider spreads reflect elevated demand to borrow U.S.
dollars in the currency forward market and often supports the
greenback's spot value against the euro
 In the options market euro/dollar month implied vols -
measure of investor demand to protect against spot price
volatility - were steady around 14.20 percent and off this
week's high of around 18 percent .
 FED EASING EYED
 While investors remain wary of the euro, they are also
reluctance to take long positions in the dollar ahead of a
Federal Reserve meeting next week, where policymakers may flag
another round of quantitative easing to boost the economy.
 That move should weigh on the dollar and help riskier
assets rally, although analysts said some market players
thought ""Operation Twist"" was the more likely outcome.
 In such a scenario the Fed would buy longer dated Treasury
bonds and sell shorter dated ones to keep rates at the longer
end lower without expanding the balance sheet.
 Daragh Maher, FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London
said the ""Operation Twist"" could be positive for the dollar
because it would stimulate growth. ""It would be seen as
delivering stimulus without printing....dollars.""
 The ICE Futures' dollar index was last up 0.4 percent at
76.551 <.DXY>. Against the yen, the dollar remained stuck at
76.730 yen , flat on the day. The threat of Japanese
intervention has helped keep dollar/yen in a tight range and
above its all-time low of 75.94 yen.

 NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Global equities rose for a

fell amid growing confidence European leaders will find a way

 Fears that Greece's fiscal troubles would bring down the

 * Euro's gains run out of steam
 * Ecofin meeting in Poland with U.S. Treasury Secretary
Geithner
 * Market players wary of taking big bets, scope for
disappointment

 By Nia Williams	
 LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Friday as
market players took profits from a rally sparked by news of
liquidity measures from major central banks, and looked
vulnerable to further declines as investors awaited news from a
meeting of EU finance ministers in Poland.	
 Investors were reluctant to take large positions ahead of
the meeting on Friday which U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner will also join. Discussions are expected to focus on
leveraging the euro zone's bailout fund to make it more
effective in fighting the debt crisis. 
 The euro was last down 0.5 percent at $1.3804 , off a
one-week peak of $1.3937 hit on Thursday but well above a
seven-month trough below $1.35 plumbed on Monday. The common
currency has bounced some 2 percent so far this week.	
 Macro funds sold the single currency through stops around
$1.3825 and a U.S. investment bank was also said to be selling
early in the European session. Asian sovereign buying around
$1.3780 slowed its decline, traders said.	
 Analysts said after the central banks' coordinated liquidity
measures on Thursday the market had built some cautious hopes
policymakers would announce further action to support the euro
at the Ecofin meeting. 
 That left investors with plenty of room for any
disappointment. 
 ""The market is not ready to make any big bets on this
meeting. Investors will be very focused on anything that
indicates disagreement between European politicians and finance
ministers on what to do on this serious issue of euro zone
debt,"" said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea.	
 ""People are taking profit from the short move higher on the
back of the dollar liquidity measure but ahead of the weekend
the market is not ready to take euro/dollar very far.""	
 After the coordinated move by the central bank, funding
strains which had hit euro zone banks hard and was impacting the
euro appeared to be easing.	
 The three-month euro/dollar cross currency basis swap
, or relative premium for swapping euro LIBOR for
dollar LIBOR, narrowed to around 89 basis points after the
announcement, from as wide as 115 basis points on Monday.	
 Wider spreads reflect elevated demand to borrow U.S. dollars
in the currency forward market and often support the greenback's
spot value against the euro. 
 Technical analysts also said that although the euro is
hovering near technical indicators showing that it is oversold
in the short term, it remains vulnerable to further falls.	
 ""Valuation-driven retracements to resistance at $1.4014 and
1.4263 are expected to attract renewed selling interest for a
test of the next support level at 1.3428,"" George E. Davis, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.	
 ""A daily close below here would then expose 1.3246, with a
close above 1.4484 required to nullify our bearish view.""	
 
 U.S. EASING AHEAD	
 While investors were wary of euro downside there was also
reluctance to take long positions in the U.S. dollar ahead of a
Federal Reserve meeting next week, where policymakers may flag
further easing measures to boost the economy.	
 Such a move, dubbed QE3, would weigh on the greenback and
help riskier assets rally.	
 ""People are looking any signs we are going to see more
easing like QE3. Any inkling that is on the cards will be the
signal for equity markets to rise and dollar selling across the
board,"" said Steven Saywell, head of FX strategy at BNP Paribas.	
 Some though are expecting the Fed to opt for ""Operation
Twist"" where it buys longer dated Treasury bonds and sell the
shorted dated ones. That keeps rates at the longer end lower
without expanding the balance sheet. Any signs that the Fed will
choose ""Operation Twist"" rather than QE3 could give the dollar a
short term lift. 
 The dollar index was last up 0.5 percent at 76.674 ,
while the greenback rose 0.6 percent versus the Swiss franc to
0.8748 francs , supported by the Swiss National bank
reiterating its commitment to defend a floor of 1.20 in the euro
versus the franc.	
 Commodity currencies slipped as the boost provided by the
dollar liquidity announcement ran out of steam.	
 The Australian dollar , which gained more than 1
percent after the central banks' move was last down 0.1 percent
at US$1.0325, while the New Zealand dollar traded off
its highs, last at US$0.8256.	
 Against the yen, the dollar remained stuck at 76.75 yen
. The threat of intervention from the Japanese authorities
has helped keep the yen in a tight range and below its all-time
high of 75.94 yen.

 * World stocks up 0.6 pct to 1-week high; banks lead Europe
 * Euro slightly off 1-week high
 * Hopes coordinated central bank action means more in store

 By Sujata Rao	
 LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - World shares rose over half a
percent to one-week highs on Friday on hopes that European
policymakers might at last come up with measures to combat a
deepening debt crisis but the euro gave up some of the gains
seen in the previous session.	
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a weak open on Wall Street.	
 Risk appetite received a boost on Thursday following
coordinated action by five major central banks to add liquidity
to a European banking system struggling with its dollar funding
needs. 
 By 0945 GMT, MSCI's benchmark global equities index was up
0.65 percent adding to gains of 1.2 percent on
Thursday while Europe's FTSE Eurofirst index of top shares rose
for the fourth straight session, up 1 percent . 
 Gains were led by banks as Credit Suisse , ING
and Societe Generale jumped more than 4.2
percent, though some financial sector stocks such as Deutsche
Bank  and Unicredit pared early strong gains.	
 ""There is a no doubt that the developments reached overnight
are positive for markets as it addresses a liquidity issue that
had begun to creep into European banks,"" said Ben Potter,
strategist at IG Markets in London. 
 ""There was a lack of confidence beginning to build in the
European interbank lending markets and these U.S. dollar funding
lines will help ease these confidence issues."" 
 The central bank action does nothing however towards
resolving the euro zone debt issue and the fear of a global
recession, issues that are weighing heavily on risk appetite.	
 Despite four days of gains, world stocks are down 3.4
percent this month and have lost 10 percent so far in 2011. 
 Focus now is on a meeting later on Friday between U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and European finance
ministers, on the possibility of leveraging the euro zone's
bailout fund to resolve the debt crisis. 
 The hope is the meeting will yield a more decisive result
that will stave off a Greek default but many were pessimistic.	
 ""The market is not ready to make any big bets on this
meeting. Investors will be very focused on anything that
indicates disagreement between European politicians and finance
ministers on what to do on this serious issue of euro zone
debt,"" said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea. 
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a weaker open for equities
after strong gains in the previous session, with futures for the
S&P 500 , for the Dow Jones  and for the Nasdaq 100
 down 0.1-0.4 percent. 
 
 EURO HANDS BACK SOME GAINS	
 Analysts said there was plenty of scope for disappointment
from the finance ministers' meeting, prompting some players to
book profits off the euro's recent gains.	
 The euro slipped 0.5 percent at $1.3800 , off a
one-week peak of $1.3937 hit on Thursday but well above a
seven-month trough below $1.35 plumbed on Monday. The common
currency has bounced some 2 percent so far this week. 
 ""People are taking profit from the short move higher on the
back of the dollar liquidity measure but ahead of the weekend
the market is not ready to take euro/dollar very far,"" Nordea's
Christensen said.	
 However, the funding strains which had hit European banks,
with a knock-on effect on the euro, appeared to be easing. 
 The three-month euro/dollar cross currency basis swap
, or relative premium for swapping euro LIBOR for
dollar LIBOR, narrowed to around 89 basis points after the
announcement, from as wide as 115 basis points on Monday. 
 Wider spreads reflect elevated demand to borrow U.S. dollars
in the currency forward market and often support the greenback's
spot value against the euro.	
 But investors remain reluctant to take big bets on the
dollar ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which could flag
more measures to boost the economy. That's especially the case
after Thursday's weak factory and job data releases.	
 Such a move, dubbed QE3, would weigh on the greenback. 
 ""Any inkling that is on the cards will be the signal for
equity markets to rise and dollar selling across the board,""
said Steven Saywell, head of FX strategy at BNP Paribas. 
 The dollar index rose 0.5 percent at 76.674 
 U.S. Treasuries steadied after 10-year yields hit two-week
highs of 2.12 percent on Thursday. By 0710 GMT the yield stood
at 2.08 percent . But German Bund futures slipped
after hitting session highs, standing 22 ticks lower at 135.80
in nervous trade ahead of the meeting in Poland.	
 The central banks' coordinated action boosted commodity
markets as well, with oil futures rising 50 cents a barrel to
around $112.8. But stock gains and the improved risk appetite
hit gold, with prices for the metal down 1 percent and heading
for the biggest weekly drop since March 2009.

 SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Sept 16 (Reuters) - European shares
were set for a stronger open on Friday and the euro steadied as
investors hoped for a big policy move from European finance
ministers to combat the region's growing debt crisis.
 Coordinated central bank action around the world to boost
liquidity for European banks, at a time when some institutions
have been shut out of short-term lending markets, has raised
speculation that policymakers may take bold steps to hold the
euro zone together. 
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner holds talks with
European finance ministers in Poland on Friday on the
possibility of leveraging the euro zone's bailout fund to help
resolve the debt crisis. 
 Equity markets in Asia rallied, taking heart from the S&P
500 closing above the 1200 level, which had proved to be
a stiff resistance over the past two weeks.	
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 2.3 percent, climbing above
a steep trendline formed off intra-day highs in August and
September.	
 ""With today's rise, it is like we are cautiously climbing up
a wall but at the same time we're thinking that the wall may
collapse if we go up any further,"" said Kenichi Hirano, a
strategist at Tachibana Securities.	
 The benchmark MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside
Japan rose 2.2 percent , with financials
providing the biggest boost.	
 The index has rebounded more than 4 percent from a 14-month
low hit on Wednesday. But it is still down more than 13 percent
in the year to date after a global market rout in August.	
 While stocks across Asia rallied, volumes remained light and
were significantly below levels seen during the selloffs over
the past six weeks, suggesting most of the gains came from
short-covering rather than real buying.	
 U.S. stock futures  were little changed, highlighting
caution in the markets over Europe and the sputtering American
economy. Factory and job data on Thursday showed further
weakness, bolstering the case for more action to support growth.	
 Highlighting weak consumer sentiment and the intense
backlash that companies are facing if they disappoint investors,
Blackberry-maker Research In Motion saw its shares
plunge 22 percent in Frankfurt trading after reporting a steep
drop in quarterly profit on limp sales. 
 With several events next week that could influence markets
such as a widely anticipated two-day U.S. Federal Reserve
meeting, President Barack Obama's speech on deficits and Chinese
manufacturing data, hedge funds were cutting some of their
bearish bets.	
 ""With the incremental dollar a hedge fund dollar, chances of
this squeeze turning into a rally rises with every somewhat
credible EU rumour,"" said Hong Kong based trader at an American
brokerage, adding that long-only funds were still holding back,
and even looking to sell into strength.	
 Funds bailed out of shares of European retailer Esprit
Holdings which lost over a fifth of their value on
Friday in Hong Kong and suffered their worst two-day drop in
history after disappointing first-half results on Thursday.

 
 ASIA FX	
 Weakness in Asian currencies as foreign investors offloaded
on regional bets and thin equity volumes, however, suggest
investors remain sceptical that the euro zone debt crisis can be
solved by providing temporary emergency funds for banks.	
 ""Obviously it's not a long-term solution, we need to see
some resolution to the sovereign debt issue to give market
confidence we'll have stronger growth over the medium-term,""
said Spiros Papadopoulos, a senior market economist at National
Australia Bank. 
""Certainly these policy measures will help improve confidence
in the short-term,"" he added. 
 This week has seen hedge funds of all stripes and mutual
funds selling Asian currencies at a rapid pace and the move
continued on Friday in spite of the stable euro.	
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3850 but was
actually up 2.1 percent on the week, with the swift move up
through $1.3750 making traders nervous about opening bets
against the currency ahead of the ECOFIN meeting and with the
next Federal Reserve meeting on Sept 20-21.	
 The weakness in Asian currencies has spilled over to the
Australian dollar because of the antipodean currency's use as a
play on investor risk-taking. 
 The Australian dollar closed flat on the day but is
down about a percent on the week.	
 Spot gold prices slid over 1 percent to $1,769.95 an ounce,
on course for the biggest weekly decline since January 2009. 
 The combination of resilient equities, a rebound in the euro
and a bearish double-top chart pattern in gold have combined to
cast a shadow on the safe-haven asset.

1135,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 15, 2011 07:40PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD climbs in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro moved higher against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Friday, as global central banks announced a concerted effort to provide fresh dollar loans to debt threatened euro-zone financial institutions.
EUR/USD hit 1.3893 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3882, rising 0.04%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3556, Monday’s low, and resistance at 1.4089, the high of September 9.
Earlier Thursday, the European Central Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks said they would coordinate an extension of loans to euro-zone banks, in an effort to secure enough cash for them to operate through the end of the year.
The announcement follows reassurances from French and German leaders that they would continue to support Greece’s participation in the European shared currency.
European stocks rallied on the news, with France’s CAC 40 surging 3.27% to 3,045.62, Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 2.1% to 5,337.54, and Germany’s DAX advanced 3.15% to end the session at 5,508.24.
Separately Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that industrial production rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in August, just above market expectations of a 0.1% gain, and following a 0.9% rise in July.
And the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits rose unexpectedly for the week ending September 9, up by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 428,000.
Economists had forecast a decline to 410,000 for the week.
Wall Street appeared to shrug off the gloomy labor numbers and instead take its cue from the ECB’s efforts to address European sovereign debt. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.66% to 11,433.20, the Nasdaq Composite Index was lifted 1.34% to 2,607.07, and the S&P 500 climbed 1.72% to close at 1,209.11.
Meanwhile, the euro was lower against both the British pound but up and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP down by 0.01% to hit 0.8781, and EUR/JPY falling 0.02% to hit 106.40.
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is due to deliver a speech in Poland later Friday after officials, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, meet to discuss an expansion of the euro region’s new bailout fund.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Global stocks advanced for a
third straight day and the euro rose sharply on Thursday after
the world's major central banks moved to ease funding for
European banks in a coordinated effort to corral Europe's debt
crisis.
 The announcement by the European Central Bank, the U.S.
Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase dollar
funding for banks indicates authorities are making a concerted
effort to snuff Europe's debt crisis after weeks of market
turmoil.
 The funding move comes three years to the day after Lehman
Brothers filed for bankruptcy, an event that marked the depths
of a financial crisis that still ravages global markets.
 ""This is good for the European banking system, so we're
seeing a push higher in equity prices,"" said Rick Klingman, a
Treasury trader at BNP Paribas in New York.
 ""The ECB-Fed joint announcement is causing a risk-on type
trade because they're providing dollar funding through
year-end.""
 European shares rose more than 2 percent and the euro
jumped over 1 percent after the ECB unveiled three-month dollar
loans in a move to prevent money markets from freezing up. On
Wall Street, stocks rose more than 1 percent. [ID:nL5E7KF2LG]
 The announcement sharply boosted bank shares in the euro
zone <.SX7P> and on Wall Street and cut aversion to risk. The
price of safe-haven government debt and gold fell.
 In another move to address the crisis, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner will discuss with European finance
ministers the possibility of leveraging the euro zone's bailout
fund to make it more effective, sources said on Thursday. For
details see [ID:nL5E7KF1CX].
 The euro  rose as high as $1.3937, according to
electronic trading platform EBS, before easing a bit to trade
up 1.1 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed up 2.1 percent, and has now gained 6.2 percent since
touching a two-year low on Tuesday. Euro zone banks <.SX7E>
rose 6.3 percent, with BNP Paribas , France's biggest
listed bank, up 13.4 percent,
 The ECB move, which came a day after the notion of common
euro zone bonds was again floated and European leaders pledged
support for Greece while insisting on austerity measures, was
still unlikely to relieve market stresses, analysts said.
 Analysts said there has been a funding crunch in Europe for
months, with dollar-rich U.S. banks reportedly requiring 130
percent collateral for a loan to European banks.
 ""The swap agreements alleviate funding concerns in the
short term, but it doesn't tackle the underlying problems, nor
is it a solution to the European crisis,"" said Lauren
Rosborough, currency strategist at WestPac in London.

up 186.45 points, or 1.66 percent, at 11,433.18. The Standard &

 There was also no clear sign from a conference call of
German, French and Greek leaders on Wednesday that a stalemate
over Athens' next bailout payment had been broken.
[ID:nLDE78D090]
 Analysts said the gains in the euro could be short-lived as
the announcement did little to calm investors' fears of a Greek
debt default.
 Bund futures fell and Greek credit default swap prices
 showed an above 90 percent chance of a default,
according to Reuters calculations based on Markit data.
 Investors pushed aside a fresh spate of disappointing data
that showed new claims for U.S. jobless aid unexpectedly rose
last week and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic regin
contracted early this month. The data backed the view the
Federal Reserve would move soon to boost economic growth.
[ID:nS1E78E0U8]
 The price of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell more than
a point as the prospect of a long stretch of loose monetary
policy coupled with higher inflation prompted investors to dump
long bonds.
 The 30-year bond  was last off 1-26/32 in price
to yield 3.37 percent. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 fell 27/32 to yield 2.09 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The euro rose the most
against the dollar in a month on Thursday after major central
banks moved to alleviate funding strains for European banks,
though few investors expect the rally to last.
 The European Central Bank said it will cooperate with the
U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and
Swiss National Bank to provide three-month dollar loans to
commercial banks in an effort to prevent the money market from
freezing up. For details, see [ID:nL5E7KF2LG]
 The announcement helped push the euro up about 1 percent
against the dollar and yen. Analysts said, however, that the
single currency's gains could be short-lived as the
announcement did little to calm investors' fears of a Greek
debt default.
 ""It's still not really addressing the problem. Overall,
we're still bearish on the euro,"" said Dave Floyd, managing
partner and head of FX trading at Aspen Trading Group based in
Bend, Oregon.
 ""Assuming that the $1.3970 level is not broken to the
upside, we see the potential for (the euro/dollar) to move back
toward $1.35 and $1.34 over the next three to four days,"" he
added.
 The euro last traded up 1 percent at $1.38932 ,
the biggest one-day percentage gain since Aug. 15. It had
earlier hit a session high of $1.39370 on trading platform EBS,
well off a seven-month low below $1.35 set on Monday.
 Euro zone banks have faced dollar funding strains in recent
months as fears have grown that Athens would default on its
debt, hitting banks that have large exposure to the country.
 Analysts said the funding crunch has been ongoing for four
months, with dollar-rich U.S. banks reportedly requiring a
130-percent collateral for a loan to European banks.
 The ECB already offers seven-day dollar loans every week,
and this offer was tapped for the second time in a month on
Wednesday. Previously, banks had not used the ECB's dollar
operation since February. [ID:nL5E7KE164]
 ILLNESS REMAINS
 The three-month euro/dollar cross currency basis swap
, or the relative premium for swapping euro
LIBOR for dollar LIBOR, narrowed to around 89 basis points
after the announcement, from as wide as 115 basis points on
Monday.
 Wider spreads reflect elevated demand to borrow U.S.
dollars in the currency forward market and often support the
greenback's spot value against the euro.
 Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York, said the ECB's move addresses the
""symptoms,"" one of which is that banks are afraid to lend to
each other, but not the ""illness,"" which is that ""Greece is
insolvent.""
 ""Today's actions won't prevent a Lehman-type event, but
they could mitigate the dislocations and market turmoil that
will likely result from such an event,"" he said. ""We fully
expect policymakers are preparing quietly for a Greek default,
and would look for more and more preparatory measures in the
coming months.""
 Lane Newman, director of foreign exchange trading at ING
Capital Market, said the currency market has priced in a
90-percent probability of an ""orderly default"" by Greece.
 Alasdair Mackay, director of currency trading at Scotia
Capital in London, said the big date to watch out for when
dollar demand is expected to be high is at the end of the
calendar year.
 Adding to strength in the euro were welcome signs from
leaders of Germany and France that they were determined to keep
Greece in the euro zone. Against the yen, the euro rose 1.1
percent to 106.555 .
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent to 76.69 yen , after
hitting a session high of 77.335 yen on EBS, with traders
citing market talk that the Bank of Japan was checking currency
rates.

 NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Global stocks advanced for a
third straight day and the euro gained on Thursday after major
central banks moved to boost European bank funding and strong
support for Greece by regional leaders eased default fears.
 European shares extended gains to more than 2 percent and
the euro jumped more than 1 percent after the European Central
Bank said it would boost the short-term supply of dollars in a
move to ease funding difficulties in the euro zone. For details
see: [ID:nF9E7JT00G]
 The euro  rose as high as $1.3937, according to
electronic trading platform EBS, before easing a bit.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
rose 2.7 percent. The benchmark index has gained 6 percent
since touching a two-year low on Tuesday.
 Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co in
New York, said the move by the ECB and other major central
banks was ""a positive in that short term relief is being given
but a negative that we are at this state to begin with.""
 ""The stress is still there as long as sovereign debt issues
aren't dealt with aggressively but this move eases short term
funding problems,"" Boockvar said.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 147.17 points, or 1.31 percent, at 11,393.90. The Standard &

at 1,203.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 26.35
points, or 1.02 percent, at 2,598.90.
 Widespread optimism came even as German Chancellor Angela

to Europe's sovereign debt crisis. [ID:nL5E7KF1CX]

 Investors also pushed aside a fresh spate of disappointing
U.S. data that showed new U.S. jobless claims rose last week to
their highest since June and a gauge of factory activity in New
York state contracted in September. [ID:nS1E78E0CT]
 The news supported the view the Federal Reserve could take
new action to boost economic growth.
 ""The overall picture from the three data releases we are
looking at is not very good,"" said Sean Incremona, an economist
at 4Cast Ltd in New York.
 Another survey showed that a gauge of factory activity in
the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region contracted for a second month in a
row in September, but the rate of decline moderated from a
steep drop the month before.
 The price of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell more than
a full point as the prospect of a long stretch of loose
monetary policy coupled with higher inflation prompted
investors to dump long bonds.
 The 30-year bond  was last off 1-16/32 in price
to yield 3.35 percent. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 fell 29/32 in price to yield 2.09 percent.
 Bund futures fell as euro zone leaders showed signs of
their determination to see out Greece's debt problems without
it leaving the single currency, prompting some to take profit
on a recent rally in safe-haven bonds. [ID:nL5E7KF192]
 Crude oil rose more than $3 a barrel, buoyed by the rally
in European equities, a weaker dollar and improved risk
appetite after euro zone leaders reiterated their commitment to
keeping Greece afloat. [ID:nL3E7KF0IJ]
 Brent crude  for October deliver, which expires on
Thursday, was up $2.60 at $115.00 a barrel.

 LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Gold fell by as much as 2.0

after data that showed a surprisingly large drop in U.S.
regional manufacturing and an unexpected rise in the number of
people filing for unemployment benefit, which again highlighted
the frailty of the U.S. economy. 
 Spot gold was last quoted at $1,787.20 an ounce at

Aug. 29. A raft of technical selling hit the market with the

 Separate reports showed U.S. consumer inflation cooled in
August as the price of gasoline receded, while manufacturing in
New York state contracted for a fourth month in a row, but by
far more than expected. 
 Also adding to worries about the ability of the world's
largest economy to avert a deeper slowdown and create jobs, was
an unexpected rise in weekly initial jobless claims.

regional manufacturing and an unexpected rise in the number of
people filing for unemployment benefit, which again highlighted
the frailty of the U.S. economy. 
 Spot gold was last quoted at $1,787.20 an ounce at
1243 GMT, down 1.8 percent on the day, having fallen to a
session low of $1,782.20 just after the data, its lowest since
Aug. 29. A raft of technical selling hit the market with the
break below $1,800.	
 Separate reports showed U.S. consumer inflation cooled in
August as the price of gasoline receded, while manufacturing in
New York state contracted for a fourth month in a row, but by
far more than expected. 
 Also adding to worries about the ability of the world's
largest economy to avert a deeper slowdown and create jobs, was
an unexpected rise in weekly initial jobless claims.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2011 08:16AM ET</span>",FOREX-Euro climbs but stays vulnerable to Greek default risk," (Adds quote, details, updates prices)	
 * Euro up after Merkel/Sarkozy pledge Greek support, but
investors see default risk
 * Options suggest more scope for euro downside
 * Swiss franc pares losses vs euro after SNB reiterates
currency stance

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday as
assurances from Germany and France that Greece would stay in the
euro zone quelled speculation that Athens may soon default on
its debt, though the possibility of a future default kept the
single currency vulnerable to more selling.	
 But the single currency retreated from the day's high versus
the Swiss franc despite the Swiss National Bank reiterating its
pledge to limit franc strength against the euro as investors
questioned how long the central bank could maintain that policy.

 The euro rose to a session high of $1.3826 after
Wednesday's joint statement from Germany and France bolstered
hopes that Greece will receive the next tranche of aid from the
EU/IMF and avoid an immediate default. 
 Easing concerns of a near-term default has pulled the euro
off a seven-month low of $1.3495 hit on Monday, but investors
remained concerned such an event may unleash a major financial
crisis in the euro zone and they remain ready to sell the
currency and riskier assets into any rally.	
 ""The fear of a chaotic Greek restructuring was driving
weakness in the euro. That level of alarm and panic has
subsided, but it's subsided only on crumbs of comfort,"" said
Paul Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale.	
 ""The market needs more concrete events in the near term or
else the euro dollar, instead of nudging up towards $1.40, will
slide back towards $1.35.""	
 He added that Greece's failure to secure more bailout funds
could be the next trigger for more selling in the euro.	
 Investors were also conscious of rising speculation that
Moody's will cut Italy's credit rating after the ratings agency
said it may slash its Aa2 rating nearly three months ago.	
 Also keeping downward pressure on the euro is the view that
euro zone rates will stay low after the European Central Bank
shifted away from its hawkish stance on rates last week.	
 The correlation between euro/dollar moves and the spread
between German and U.S. bond yields is beginning to strengthen
following a weakening in past months, suggesting moves in bond
yields may soon become a bigger driver for euro/dollar.
 
 The euro hovered around $1.3800 in European trade, also
supported by a near 2 percent rise in European shares . 
 But risk reversals, a measure of the premium required to
hold a put or a call in a currency, continue to show a strong
bias for euro downside, showing the market expects further falls
in the single currency. 
 Many traders expect the euro to eventually test the recent
low below $1.35, while resistance is seen at a previous support
point around $1.3835 and then $1.3895, a 38.2 percent
retracement of its fall this month. 
 
 DOUBTS ABOUT SNB 
 The euro is also burdened by mounting worries over the
crisis spreading to the euro zone's bigger economies, prompting
talk that joint euro zone bonds, which Germany strongly opposes,
may be needed to instil confidence in the currency bloc.

 U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs has lowered its
euro/dollar forecasts for the euro against the dollar due to
rising tensions in the euro zone. It sees the euro at $1.40 in
three months' time, versus a previous forecast of $1.45.	
 Gains in the euro knocked the dollar 0.3 percent
lower to 76.571 versus a currency basket, while the U.S.
currency was flat on the day at 76.57 yen .	
 The euro traded 0.1 percent higher on the day at
1.2055 francs, pulling back from a session high of 1.2094 but
holding above the 1.20 floor set by the SNB last week in
response to the franc's recent climb to record highs against the
euro and the dollar.	
 The Swiss franc initially slipped after the SNB's quarterly
policy announcement, when it also held interest rates and said
it saw no imminent inflation risks. 
 A lack of price pressures would leave the SNB free to print
as much money as it likes to cap the franc's gains.	
 But traders reported strong demand for euro/Swiss downside
options, a sign that the market is sceptical about the SNB's
ability to defend its target level.	
 ""Risk reversals (are) very bid for downside, reflecting the
fact that the market is worried about the SNB's ability to hold
the 1.20 barrier over a longer period of time,"" CitiFX Wire said
in a note.

 By Patrick Graham	
 LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Stock markets rose for a third
day on Thursday and the euro steadied, helped by signs that euro
zone leaders are committed to keeping Greece afloat for now.	
 European markets rose by almost 2 percent before
trimming gains, with banking shares recovering from an
initial dip on news of a $2 billion loss for Swiss bank UBS due
to unauthorised trading by a London-based employee.	
 Worries over the euro zone crisis and a global slide into
recession have hammered shares since late July and there was
little conviction this week's gains were anything other than
just a breather.	
 ""Given the fact that we are not seeing much more than
rhetoric at the moment, many people are still expecting Greece
to default and see the move up as nothing more than a relief
rally,"" Zahid Mahmood, trader at Capital Spreads, said. 
 French and German leaders urged Greece's prime minister in a
conference call late on Wednesday to meet the terms of its new
bailout and said they were determined to keep the country in the
euro zone. 
 A Greek government official said afterwards that Athens
looked set to get approval from EU and IMF inspectors for the
issue of its next tranche of debt. 
 A senior German lawmaker sounded similar noises early on
Thursday and Spain also added to the mix by successfully placing
bonds, albeit at relatively high yields.

 At 0930 GMT, European stocks were up 1.2 percent,
reflecting strong gains for all the major markets and a 1
percent higher close for Wall Street overnight .	
 World stocks gained 0.7 percent, helped by
Japan's Nikkei share average closing 1.8 percent higher.	
 The euro traded virtually flat on the session.	
 
 
 CREDIT CRUNCH	
 The euro gained sharply on the assurances from the
Greek conference call but it later pulled back and looked set to
stay weak on worries about Athens' ability to avoid a debt
default in the months ahead.	
 European finance ministers have been warned confidentially
of the danger of a renewed credit crunch as a ""systemic"" crisis
in euro zone sovereign debt spills over to banks, according to
documents obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. 
 Market players, spooked by fears a default in the euro bloc
could unleash a financial crisis, remain ready to sell the
currency and risk assets into any rally. The single currency was
almost unchanged on the day at 1.3770 to the dollar, off highs
hit late on Wednesday.	
 ""The comments from Merkel and Sarkozy have supported
sentiment in the short-term but there's not much scope for a
serious improvement in attitudes towards the periphery or
overall growth conditions in the euro zone right now,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich. 
 ""It's also quite likely the ECB will need to take a more
dovish stance so we don't think the euro will stay supported for
long,"" he added.	
 The improvement in tone hit many perceived safe-haven
assets, including the dollar and U.S. Treasuries and German Bund
futures . 
 Oil traded up near $113, although the upside was capped as
the market awaited a bundle of data from the United States for
an update on the progress of the economic recovery. 
 Brent crude  gained was up 1.3 percent while U.S.
crude  was almost unchanged at $88.90.

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The euro slipped in Asia on
Thursday, with initial relief over assurances from Germany and
France about keeping Greece in the euro bloc wearing off amid
scepticism over whether euro zone policymakers can really help
Athens avoid default.	
 The euro is under pressure as market players, spooked by
fears that a possible debt default in the euro bloc could
unleash a major financial crisis, remain ready to sell the euro
and risk assets into any rally.	
 The euro slipped 0.3 percent to $1.3714 , off a high
of $1.3784 hit on Wednesday after a joint statement from Germany
and France helped bolster hopes that Greece will receive the
next tranche of aid from the EU/IMF and avoid imminent
default. 
 ""It eased concern, following the departure of key German
officials from the ECB, that the Germans' commitment to the euro
may be weakening. That triggered a bit of short-covering,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital in
Tokyo, referring to the resignations of Juergen Stark last week
and Axel Weber earlier this year from the European Central Bank.	
 ""But there were no new steps, so the conference call did
not offer any fresh reason to buy the euro,"" he added, echoing
widespread worries over how Greece will meet tough fiscal
targets as austerity measures hurt its economy.	
 Many traders expect the euro to eventually test Monday's
seven-month low just below $1.35, while resistance is seen at a
previous support point around $1.3835 and then $1.3895, a 38.2
percent retracement of its fall this month.	
 The euro is also burdened by mounting worries over contagion
of the debt crisis to the euro zone's bigger economies.	
 Speculation is rife that Moody's might downgrade its rating
on Italian debt soon as it is almost 90 days since the U.S.
agency said it may cut the Aa2 rating.	
 Also attracting attention is Spain's debt auction later in
the day. Spain is expected to pay a heavy premium to borrow up
to 4 billion euros via three bond issues after Italy had to pay
the highest interest rates in the euro era to sell five-year
debt on Tuesday. 
 This will be followed by an informal meeting on Friday of
euro bloc finance ministers.	
 
 EUROPE FALLOUT	
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.6 percent to $1.0193
, near a one-month low of $1.0178 marked on Wednesday,
on worries about fallout from the European crisis on the global
economy.	
 Traders said the Aussie's fall also reflected investors'
inclination to take profits from whatever assets they could.
Against this backdrop, gold fell nearly 1 percent.	
 Speculators were also pulling funds out of Asian currencies,
which had been strengthening until recently, with the Korean won
posting big losses for the second day in a row to a six-month
low of 1119.9 won per U.S. dollar.	
 ""Real money investors are continuing to sell emerging Asian
currencies. Investors seem to feel like offloading assets with
limited liquidity on worries that they may not be able to sell
when they want to,"" said Kimihiko Tomita, head of forex at State
Street Bank in Tokyo.	
 ""It's not that their selling has accelerated of late. But it
just doesn't stop. That's the problem. Everybody now thinks cash
is king,"" he said.	
 The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.5 percent to
$0.8127 after a dovish-sounding statement by the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand . As expected, the
central bank left rates on hold at 2.5 percent. 
 The yen was supported not far from its record high against
the dollar by virtue of Japan having one of the most liquid debt
markets in the world, attracting some safe-haven bids.	
 The dollar stood at 76.70 yen , near a record low of
75.941 yen hit last month, though concerns that Tokyo may
intervene to curb the yen's strength supported the dollar.	
 The Swiss franc, traditionally seen as safe-haven, has been
capped after the Swiss National Bank set a ceiling of 1.20
francs per euro last week.	
 The franc stood at 1.2060 francs per euro , with
the SNB expected to reaffirm its commitment to cap the franc and
possibly announce further steps to curb the currency in a
quarterly policy decision due at 0730 GMT.

 By Vikram Subhedar and Alex Richardson	
 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - European stock
index futures rose on Thursday, following a bounce in Asia, on
signs that European policymakers are taking tentative steps to
tackle a crippling debt crisis, but the euro slipped amid
scepticism that a Greek default can be avoided.	
 Global equities were buoyed by comments from a top European
official on plans for a common euro zone bond and by France and
Germany pledging their commitment to keeping debt-laden Greece
in the single currency.	
 Still, some fund managers doubted the rebound would be
sustained.	
 ""I haven't seen anything that provides me comfort that the
situation has been dealt with yet,"" said Simon Burge, a
portfolio manager at ATI Asset Management in Sydney.	
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  rose 1.1 percent, and
DAX  and CAC-40  futures also gained around 1
percent , while financial bookmakers called the FTSE
100 to open as much as 1.4 percent up. 
 Equity markets have been hammered since late July on the
twin fears of renewed recession in the United States and the
potential for Europe's sovereign debt woes to trigger a wider
crisis in the financial system. This week, European stocks
hitting a two-year low.	
 
 
 TECH STOCKS DO THE BEST	
 Japan's Nikkei share average closed 1.8 percent
higher, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares
outside Japan gained 0.9 percent, with tech
stocks the best performers . 
 The Nikkei was coming off a two-and-a-half year closing low
on Wednesday, while the MSCI index, which touched a 14-month low
in the previous session, remained more than 20 percent below its
2011 high in April.	
 Optimism over tentative steps to resolve Europe's debt
crisis trumped weaker-than-expected retail sales data in the
U.S., helping the S&P 500 close up more than 1 percent.	
 Some traders attributed the gains on Wall Street to
short-covering -- when market players buy to realise profits on
bets a stock will fall in price -- ahead of inflation numbers in
the United States, with Europe still the clear focus. 
 
 CREDIT CRUNCH	
 European finance ministers have been warned confidentially
of the danger of a renewed credit crunch as a ""systemic"" crisis
in euro zone sovereign debt spills over to banks, according to
documents obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. 
 The euro jumped to a three-day peak of $1.3873 on Wednesday
after a 25-minute telephone call between the leaders of France,
Germany and Greece which boosted confidence that Athens will
receive the next tranche of aid from the European Union and IMF
and avoid imminent default.	
 The single currency's recovery was further helped after
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso flagged plans
to present options soon for the introduction of common euro
bonds, seen by many as a key tool to ease the crisis. 
 The project, however, is likely to meet stiff political
resistance and potential legal challenges in
Germany. 
 The euro edged down on Thursday to around $1.3720 .
Most strategists believe its trend remains downwards, with only
short-term solutions to the crisis on the table for now. 
 ""Nothing has changed. Greece is still highly
likely to have to do more restructuring,"" said Joseph Capurso,
currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

 BONDS FIRM	
 Many perceived safe-haven assets, including the dollar, U.S.
Treasuries and Japanese government bonds (JGBs), remained in
demand, underlining the brittle nature of the stocks rally.	
 Ten-year Treasury notes nudged up 1.5/32 in price to yield
1.988 percent , compared with 1.992 percent in late
U.S. trade. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of
major currencies . 
 The yield on benchmark 10-year JGBs was steady at 0.990
percent. 
 ""Stocks are catching up with the relief rally on Wall
Street, but bonds are being supported too as investors fret over
a possible rating cut to Italy and a Greek default,"" said a
trader at a European bank.	
 But spot gold slipped around 0.7 percent to about
$1,808 an ounce, after falling nearly 1 percent in the previous
session. It hit a lifetime high of around $1,920 an ounce last
week. 
 Oil eased as rising fuel stocks and falling demand in top
consumer the United States reinforced views that slowing
economic growth and Europe's debt crisis would dent energy use.	
 Brent crude  edged down 0.3 percent to $112 a barrel,
while U.S. crude  lost 0.4 percent to $88.57. 
 ""The concern is that what starts as a financial crisis will
drive the cost of borrowing to levels where it is difficult for
the corporate world to invest, depressing economic activity and
putting pressure on oil,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets
strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Global equities rallied and
the euro rose on Wednesday as optimism over tentative steps to
resolve Europe's debt crisis overcame still widespread fears
that Greece will ultimately default on its debt.
 Stocks on Wall Street jumped more than 2 percent after
Europe's top bureaucrat said plans for a common euro zone bond,
seen by many as a key tool to ease the region's festering debt
crisis, would soon be presented. For details, see
[ID:nL3E7KE09F]
 Equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic jumped and the
euro rose. Creation of such a bond would give the weaker
countries in the euro zone access to cheaper funds, although
Germany has consistently opposed such a move. [ID:nLDE78D03R]
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed up 1.4 percent at 913.22, while MSCI's
all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.9 percent.
 ""The focus today seems to be on whether or not Greece
defaults, and the market is anticipating that the can will
again be kicked down the road, avoiding a default,"" said Clark
Yingst, chief market analyst at Joseph Gunnar & Co in New
York.
 ""Still, the market is fluctuating intraday on the
uncertainty related to the issue,"" Yingst said.
 The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel
Barroso, acknowledged as much, saying Europe was facing its
most serious challenge in a generation, but there was no simple
solution.
 Stocks and the euro extended gains after France and Germany
said Greece's future remains in the euro zone, tapping down
fears of a departure that could spark a systemic rupture.
[ID:nP6E7JV05EID:nP6E7JV05E]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 228.67
points, or 2.06 percent, at 11,334.52. The Standard & Poor's

1,196.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 58.05
points, or 2.29 percent, at 2,590.20.
 The euro's initial tepid gains suggested a clear outcome to
the European debt crisis was still not in hand. The currency
rose 0.5 percent against the dollar to $1.3726 .
 DEBT ISSUE STILL A CONCERN
 The market's path of least resistance is still lower until
Europe pulls a rabbit from the hat and resolves the debt issue,
said Troy Buckner, managing principle at hedge fund NuWave
Investment Management in Parsippany, New Jersey.
 While equities have posted modest gains in recent days, key
commodity markets have failed to participate, he said.
 ""For the moment at least, our strategies are pointing to
'risk off' in both commodity and stock markets,"" Buckner said.
 Copper fell to within 2 percent of its 2011 low, and gold
fell as volatile prices hurt the precious metal's safe-haven
appeal.

in U.S. product inventories dragged down U.S. futures.
 Brent crude  for October delivery settled up 51
cents at $112.40 a barrel, while U.S. October crude

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Wednesday as comments by the European Commission
president raised hopes for the introduction of shared euro area
bonds that could help contain the region's debt crisis.
 Also buoying the euro was a joint statement from German and
French leaders following a conference call that they are
convinced Greece's future is in the euro zone. For story,
[ID:nA8E7K2008] [ID:nP6E7JVO5E]
 In afternoon New York trading, the euro was up 0.6 percent
at $1.37514  on electronic platform EBS after having
climbed as high as $1.37720, a three-day peak.
 The dollar fell to its lowest level versus the yen since
Sept. 2 at 76.64 yen , within the 76.40/77.85 range of
the last three weeks. Investors remained wary of possible
intervention by Japan to weaken the yen.
 ""European developments remain central to currency market
movements,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at
Wells Fargo in New York.
 Recent comments by China's Premier Wen Jiabao and U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner suggest international
pressure on European officials is rising, he said.
 ""That pressure is understandable given that European events
remain the key threat to financial market stability and global
recovery at the moment.""
 The European Union's most senior finance officials will
warn ministers this week about the threat of a renewed credit
crunch as a ""systemic"" crisis in sovereign debt spills over to
banks. [ID:nLDE78DOEZ]
 The Dutch finance minister, meanwhile, said the government
will do everything it can to save the euro and they had not
given up on the rescue for Greece. [ID:nWEA4414]
 Lane Newman, director of FX trading at ING Capital Markets
in New York said even though the euro is currently trading
around $1.37, ""it is very much on the backfoot.""
 He added that ""there is a lot of position-liquidation going
on,"" in almost all currencies and the euro was the first to go
down as a result. The recovery in the euro doesn't really
change its bearish outlook, Newman said.
 ""The question is whether the euro zone bailout fund has
enough money to preserve countries such as Germany, France, and
Spain, when you take into account the costs to restructuring
Greek, Portuguese, and Irish debt.""
 The euro rose after European Commission President Jose
Manuel Barroso pledged the Commission would soon publish a
long-promised study on introducing euro area bonds, viewed by
some as a potential solution to sovereign debt concerns.
[ID:nLDE78D03R]
 Market players remained wary after Barroso warned the move
would not end the crisis. Germany also remains firmly opposed
to any such move. [ID:nB5E7K601K]
 Moody's downgrade of Societe Generale  and Credit

had been widely anticipated. [ID:nL3E7KE09F]

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The euro and world equities
struggled to eke out gains on Wednesday as efforts by European
leaders to cap the region's escalating debt crisis failed to
quell investor fears.
 Early optimism over steps to create euro zone bonds faded,
causing equity markets and the euro to see-saw. A delay in
starting a scheduled conference call among German, French and
Greek leaders added to investors' angst and a topsy-turvy
market.
 ""There's a fair degree of uncertainty ahead of those debt
talks,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Travelex
Global Business Payments in Washington.
 U.S. government debt prices rose on the market uncertainty,
even as stocks on Wall Street and the euro recovered after
retreating earlier in the session.
 The euro bounced off of session lows after Austria's
finance ministry said a vote over upgrading the European
Financial Stability Facility -- the euro zone's bailout fund --
which an Austrian parliamentary committee failed to approve,
would win legislative backing.
 The euro last traded at $1.3705 , up 0.2 percent
on the day.
 Wall Street also rebounded.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 12.33
points, or 0.11 percent, at 11,118.18. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 3.35 points, or 0.29 percent, at
1,176.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 16.02
points, or 0.63 percent, at 2,548.17.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index rose 0.1 percent, and
Europe managed to close higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top European shares finished up 1.5 percent at 913.62
points.
 U.S. Treasuries edged higher. Benchmark 10-year notes
 rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.0 percent.
 Moody's Investors Service downgraded two of France's
largest banks, but the ratings cut was smaller than expected
and did not include a third bank, as many had feared.
[ID:nL3E7KE09F]
 Investors backed away from their initial enthusiasm over
comments by the president of the European Union's executive
body, who said it was presenting options for euro area bonds.
Investors surmised it may not be enough to snuff the crisis.

 * Euro climbs, real money and leveraged accounts seen buying
 * EU's Barroso comments on euro bonds help euro off lows
 * Confidence fragile, further falls below $1.35 seen
possible

 By Nia Williams	
 LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Wednesday, turning positive in tandem with stocks after
European Commission comments suggesting the possibility of joint
euro area bonds, but remained vulnerable to a drop towards
recent lows.	
 Demand from real money and short covering by leveraged
investors pushed the single currency to a session high of
$1.3742 , market players said. Traders also cited demand
for euros at the 1100 GMT London fix.	
 Gains were capped by offers above $1.3730-50, and the euro
was seen vulnerable to a test of Monday's seven-month trough at
$1.3495. It was last trading up 0.3 percent at $1.3720.	
 The single currency climbed after European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso pledged the Commission would soon
publish a long-promised study on introducing euro area bonds,
considered a potential solution to the debt crisis.	
 Although the comments boosted riskier assets including
stocks, market players remained wary after Barroso warned the
move would not put an end to the crisis, while Germany also
remains firmly opposed to any such move. 
 ""I cannot imagine Germany being in a position to support
this so it's hard to believe this euro bonds idea will run
smoothly,"" said Derek Halpenny, currency strategist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi.	
 ""FX short-term players and momentum players were short and
something like this that alters perceptions in any way, whether
you believe or not, leads to people covering their risk. We've
had this bounce but scepticism will come back pretty quickly.""	
 Focus now turns to a conference call due later on Wednesday
between Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

 Markets were hopeful the call may result in support for
Greece and tame concerns about a Greek default. but they were
not confident any agreement would be enough to stem contagion to
larger euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain.	
 Meanwhile, concerns about the fragility of the euro zone
banking sector weighed on sentiment after Moody's earlier cut
the credit ratings of two major French banks, pressuring the
euro and high-yielding currencies like the Aussie dollar.	
 ""If pressure continues on bigger countries like Spain and
Italy and if there is no help from the Federal Reserve in the
form of more quantitative easing there is a risk of euro/dollar
settling into a $1.35-$1.30 range,"" said Roberto Mialich,
currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.	
 ""One piece of negative news is enough to erase any recovery
in euro/dollar at the moment"".	
 
 U.S. CONCERN OVER EURO ZONE	
 As a measure of the concern in Washington over the euro zone
situation, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will take
the unprecedented step of attending a meeting of EU finance
ministers in Poland on Friday. 
 It will be his second trip to Europe in a week after he met
his main EU counterparts at a G7 meeting last weekend.	
 Focus will switch back to the U.S. dollar next week when the
Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Committee meets, with any hints
policymakers are considering another round of quantitative
easing likely to weigh on the dollar.	
 
 The dollar index was last flat at 76.921, and the
cautious rise in investor appetite to take on risk helped the
Australian dollar pare some losses to last trade down 0.5
percent at US$1.0262 .	
 It earlier fell more than 1 percent to a low of US$1.0178,
hit particularly hard after a downward adjustment to
second-quarter inflation added to the case against higher rates.

 The dollar edged lower versus the yen to 76.78 ,
within the 76.40/77.85 range of the last three weeks. Investors
remained wary of possible intervention by Japan to weaken the
yen, after the Swiss National Bank set a minimum target exchange
rate in the euro versus the franc last week.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European shares and the euro
rose on Wednesday after the head of the European Commission
said it would soon present options for the introduction of euro
area bonds, a development investors saw as a positive despite
German opposition to the idea.
 The comments from Jose Manuel Barroso helped reverse
earlier losses for the single currency and European stocks
triggered by the downgrade of two big French banks' credit
ratings. U.S. stock index futures pointed to a firm start on
Wall Street.
 Common euro zone sovereign bonds are perceived to be part
of a solution as they would give weak euro zone states renewed
access to funding in commercial markets.
 Barroso's words repeat an earlier pledge from EU officials
to make such proposals in October, while Germany, without whose
approval the scheme cannot be introduced, remains strongly
opposed to the issuance of common bonds.[ID:nLDE78D03R]
 Global markets have been roiled since the end of July by
the twin fears of a recession in the United States and Europe's
protracted debt woes, which have forced Greece, Ireland and
Portugal to take bailouts and piled bond market pressure on
Italy and Spain.
 The crisis has the potential to derail global growth.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel are due to talk with Greek Prime Minister George
Papandreou on Wednesday, with investors concerned by a lack of
decisive action and increased chances Athens will soon
default.
 ""It (common bonds) could be a turning point and a major
step forward as countries with higher debt levels will have the
ability again to finance themselves,"" said Klaus Wiener, chief
economist at Generali Investments, which manages 330 billion
euros ($450 billion).
 ""But if we get euro bonds, there will be some strings
attached. There will be strong governance in terms of fiscal
prudence, otherwise it can not work.""
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index was up 1.5 percent,
although the index is down nearly 19 percent so far this year.
Banks also pared losses, with the European sector index <.SX7P>
up 0.85 percent. But Societe Generale  was down 3.8
percent and BNP Paribas  down 3 percent.
 Wall Street was set for a firm start. S&P 500 futures
 were up 0.8 percent, the Dow Jones  up 0.85
percent while the Nasdaq 100  was 0.95 percent higher.

 DEFAULT, DOWNGRADES
 Earlier, investors cut exposure to riskier assets after
Moody's Investors Service cut its ratings for French banks
Credit Agricole  and Societe Generale  on
Wednesday.
 Moody's said it downgraded the credit rating of Societe
Generale by one notch because it no longer saw the bank getting
additional ""systemic support"" over its peers, while Credit
Agricole was downgraded due to continuing concerns about its
Greek exposure [ID:nL3E7KB0D9]
 While Greece dominated sentiment, concerns about contagion
to bigger economies like Italy and Spain lingered.
 Italy's lower house of parliament passed a 54 billion euro
($74 billion) austerity measure aimed at staving off a
financial crisis in euro zone's third largest economy. The
country was forced to pay the highest interest rates since
joining the euro in 1999 to sell 5-year bonds on
Tuesday.[ID:nL5E7KD3C5]
 Italy is a particular worry because, while Europe's bailout
fund can cope with rescuing smaller, peripheral nations, it
lacks the financial firepower to save major economies.
 The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.3725  against the
dollar, climbing from around $1.3630 before the comments from
Barroso.
 ""The market may get comfort from those kind of comments but
overall the picture is increasingly negative and appetite from
foreign investors for euro zone assets seems to be waning,""
said Ian Stannard, head of European currency strategy at Morgan
Stanley.
 German government bonds pared gains while the cost of
insuring Italian and Spanish debt against default also fell.
But Greek two-year government bond yields  marched
relentlessly higher, rising 3.3 percentage points to approach
95 percent.[GVD/EUR] ($1 = 0.731 Euros)

 TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The euro dropped on Wednesday,
back towards a seven-month low plumbed this week, with risk
sentiment that was shaky ahead of debt talks between Greece,
France and Germany further knocked by Australian inflation data.	
 Alarm over euro zone's debt has reached new highs and on
Tuesday Italy was forced to offer the highest interest on 5-year
paper since it joined the euro in 1999. 
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3622 , giving up
earlier modest gains which had been made on short-covering by
hedge funds after news of the teleconference between the three
European countries emerged. 
 ""The conference call will at least calm nerves ... and may
provide 24 hours of reprieve. That's about it, though,"" said
Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac. ""There are
plenty of road bumps (ahead)."" 
 The euro has dropped more than nine cents, or 6 percent, in
two weeks from a high of around $1.4548 on Aug. 29, hitting a
seven month trough on Monday at $1.3495.	
 The Australian dollar tumbled around one cent to $1.0215
after a downward adjustment to second-quarter inflation
added to the case against higher rates while a break of key
support triggered heavy selling from macro funds.

 The move weighed heavily on other riskier assets, with
strong selling also emerging in other Asian currencies such as
the Korean won which tumbled more than two percent, while the
Indonesian rupiah and the Malaysian ringgit both fell around one
percent.	
 ""People are taking profits from whatever assets they have
profits to take on. If they start to sell Asian stocks, that'll
be pretty nasty,"" said a Japanese bank trader.	
 The fall in the Aussie accelerated after it slipped below
major support at $1.0247, the 61.8 percent retracement of its
rally last month, and at one point it dropped to a one month low
of $1.0210. 
 ""It all started from the Aussie, spilled to stocks and in a
typical 'risk-off' fashion weighed on the euro,"" said Katsunori
Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking, adding
that with more political events ahead, traders were reluctant to
offload further.	
 In a measure of the alarm in Washington, Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner will take the unprecedented step of attending a
meeting of EU finance ministers in Poland on Friday. It will be
his second trip to Europe in a week after he met his main EU
counterparts at a G7 meeting last weekend.	


 FRENCH BANKS' RATINGS CUT 
 With the euro's sharp decline in the past two weeks,
investors have been pricing in the growing prospect of a Greek
default, as well as a likely Italian sovereign rating cut by
Moody's.	
 They have already priced in a rating cut to the top French
banks, with the euro holding steady after Moody's downgraded
ratings on Credit Agricole SA and Societe Generale SA by one
notch, citing their exposure to the Greek economy. 
 Comments from China's Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday that
China is willing to invest more in European countries failed to
inspire a new bounce for the euro. This week it rose after a
news report, later denied by Italian officials, that China had
been asked to purchase large chunks of Italian debt.

 Some in the market are now hoping for progress on at least
the next tranche of aid for Greece, which would put off a
default, at least for now. 
 Support for the euro is seen at $1.3557 and $1.3495, while
resistance lies at its 100-week moving average at $1.3738. A
break above that could test a key barrier at around $1.3900, the
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its $1.4550/$1.3494 move.	
 The fall in dollar's major crosses, pushed the dollar index
to 77.28, after a 0.6 percent drop on Tuesday. Against
the yen, the dollar slipped to 76.86 yen , but remained
within the snug 76.40/77.85 range of the last three weeks.	
 Investors have been wary of a possible intervention by Japan
to weaken its currency, following Switzerland's lead last month.
The yen has been the primary beneficiary of safe-haven flows
after the Swiss National Bank took aggressive actions to halt
the rise of its currency.	
 Figures on U.S. producer prices and retail sales are due
later in the day, along with industrial production data in
Europe.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European stock index futures
fell on Wednesday following an equity sell-off in Asia, where
some regional indexes hit lows last plumbed in 2009, on
persistent fears that Europe's sovereign debt problems are
causing a banking crisis.
 The euro zone's troubles -- underscored by a downgrade from
Moody's for two big French banks -- knocked the single currency
lower, while in Asia mutual funds slashed bets on regional
currencies to shore up other parts of their portfolios.
 Global markets have been roiled since the end of July by
the twin fears of renewed recession in the United States and
Europe's protracted debt woes, which have seen Greece, Ireland
and Portugal forced to take bailouts and piled bond market
pressure on Italy and Spain.
 ""Some of the European banks may have to recapitalise their
balance sheets with government assistance. It's creating a lot
of nervousness and uncertainty,"" said Simon Bonouvrie,
portfolio manager at Platypus Asset Management in Sydney.
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  fell 1.1 percent, and
DAX  and CAC-40  futures also dropped more than 1
percent, while financial bookmakers called the FTSE 100 <.FTSE>
to open down 0.8 percent.

 Oil eased after the International Energy Agency revised
down its forecast for growth in consumption due to the
struggling global economy.
 Underlining the brittle state of confidence in global
markets, the dollar and U.S. Treasuries rose and the yield on
10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) fell below 1 percent,
as demand for assets perceived as safe havens remained high.

rule-of-thumb definition of a bear market.

pointing to a reversal of Wall Street's gains on Tuesday. [.N]
 DEFAULT, DOWNGRADES
 Markets had been spooked in recent days by renewed talk
among euro zone policymakers of an imminent default by Greece,
prompted by the country's failure to meet the fiscal goals set
out in its European Union/IMF bailout.
 Greek, German and French leaders were due to hold a
conference call at 1600 GMT on Wednesday.
 ""The conference call will at least calm nerves ... and may
provide 24 hours of reprieve. That's about it, though,"" said
Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac in
Sydney.
 The euro eased to around $1.3635  against the dollar,
having jumped more than a cent in the previous session on news
of the conference call. The single currency tumbled to a
seven-month trough of $1.3499 earlier this week. [FRX/]
 Moody's Investors Service downgraded credit ratings on
French banks Credit Agricole  and Societe Generale
 on Wednesday.
 Moody's said it downgraded the credit rating of Societe
Generale by one notch because it no longer saw the bank getting
additional ""systemic support"" over its peers, while Credit
Agricole was downgraded due to continuing concerns about its
Greek exposure. [ID:nL3E7KB0D9]
 Confidence in the euro zone had been further dented on
Tuesday when Italy, where lawmakers vote later on an austerity
package at 1800 GMT, was forced to pay the highest interest
rates since joining the euro in 1999 to sell 5-year bonds.
[ID:nL5E7KD3C5]
 Italy is a particular concern because, while Europe's
bailout fund can cope with rescuing smaller, peripheral
nations, it lacks the financial firepower to save the euro
zone's third largest economy.
 Europe's woes drove investors to seek shelter in the
dollar, which rose 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies <.DXY>, while the yield on 10-year Treasury notes
fell to 1.965 percent .
 The Australian dollar  fell 1 percent and there were
similar falls for the Indonesian rupiah  and Malaysian
ringgit , as mutual funds closed positions in Asian
currencies that have long been outperformers.
 ""People are taking profits from whatever assets they have
profits to take on,"" a Japanese bank trader said.
 CREDIT FREEZE
 The exposure of European banks to sovereign debt has raised
fears of a freezing of credit markets in a re-run of the panic
that gripped the financial sector after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in late 2008.
 Data from the Institute of International Finance this month
showed European banks have 3 trillion euros invested in
sovereign debt, or 8 percent of their total assets.
 In a measure of the alarm in Washington, Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner will take the unprecedented step of attending
a meeting of EU finance ministers in Poland on Friday.
 Benchmark 10-year JGB futures <2JGBv1> gained 0.16 point to
142.73, with the 10-year yield  easing 1 basis
point to 0.990 percent. [JP/]
 ""People are hesitant to sell bonds because they think it
will be hard to solve the fundamental problems of the euro
zone,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Reflecting the gloomy outlook for the developed world, the
Asian Development Bank on Wednesday trimmed its 2011 and 2012
growth forecasts, while noting the region's emerging economies
were showing resilience. [ID:nL3E7KC20L]
 Expectations of sagging growth hurt commodities that are
dependent on industrial demand, as did the stronger dollar,
which makes assets priced in the U.S. currency more expensive
for holders of other currencies.
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.6 percent to $88.72 a barrel,
while Brent crude  eased 0.5 percent to $111.30. Copper
 weakened 1 percent to $8,680 a tonne. [O/R] [MET/L]

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro
rose on Tuesday on hopes Europe's top powers will supply fresh
support for Greece, even as uncertainty driven by fears of a
Greek default coursed through markets.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel sought to quash talk of an
imminent default but market confidence suffered another blow
when Italy had to pay the highest yield to sell five-year bonds
since it joined the euro zone in 1999. For details, see
[ID:nL5E7KD1TR]
 A Reuters report quoting a Greek government official saying
that Greek, German and French leaders would hold a conference
call on Wednesday helped buoy the euro and underpin optimism in
European equity markets. Two German government sources
confirmed the plans. [ID:nL5E7KD29C] [ID:nB4E7K9007]
 ""The market is still very much focused on the euro. We are
back to watching headlines and it seems like there are more
rumors than fact,"" said David Watt, senior currency strategist,
at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""In general, it's still a very cautious backdrop and it's
hard to see a sustained back-up in the euro and even for that
matter, a sustained back-up in the European stock markets,"" he
added.
 The euro  rose 0.2 percent to $1.3691 against the
U.S. dollar. Against the yen the euro fell to a low of 104.37
 before moving back to 105.18, down 0.3 percent.
 Markets priced in the likelihood of default. Reuters
calculations based on Markit credit default swap prices put the
probability of a Greek default at 90 percent. Greek two-year
bond yields  hit a record near 94 percent.
 Despite the solid equity gains, some investors said prices
were still poised to fall further, with some pointing to the
lows of the financial crisis as possible.
 ""The question is not 'if' indexes will revisit March 2009
lows, but 'when,'"" said Vincent Ganne, technical analyst at
TradingSat. ""Is it going to happen in the next two weeks or in
December? Hard to say.""
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.9 percent and Wall Street rebounded.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 44.73
points, or 0.40 percent, at 11,105.85. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 10.60 points, or 0.91 percent, at
1,172.87. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 37.06
points, or 1.49 percent, at 2,532.15.
 Consumer staple shares registered the biggest declines,
weighed by Best Buy Co Inc , which fell to a new 52-week
low following weak quarterly results.
 Oracle Corp , Intel Corp  and Apple Inc
 were among the top boosts to the Nasdaq.
 Brian Battle, a trader at Performance Trust Capital
Partners in Chicago, said stocks were being pulled by those who
see them as overvalued given the economy is on the cusp of
recession, and those who say stocks are historically cheap.
 ""We're going to wrestle around and remain range-bound until
we figure out which theory is true,"" Battle said.
 European stocks rallied from two-year lows to end higher,
although the sharp rise in Italy's borrowing costs and
simmering fears of a Greek default kept gains in check.
[ID:nP6E7KC093]
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed up 1.06 percent at 900.43.
 Banks in Europe bounced back in what was mostly seen as a
technical rally, with Societe Generale  rising 15
percent and Deutsche Bank  gaining 8.2 percent.
 U.S. Treasury prices retreated as stocks gained and
weakened demand for safe-haven U.S. government debt. Earlier in
Europe, yields on benchmark German Bunds  set a
historic low at 1.68 percent.[ID:nS1E78C0OL]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 14/32 in price to yield 2.0 percent.
 Brent crude prices slipped, dragged down by a downward
revision to the International Energy Agency's forecast for
growth in global oil consumption due to the struggling economy
and so-called spread selling. [ID:nL5E7KD1VP]
 Traders extended a deep sell-off in the premium of Brent to
U.S. crude futures  into a second day. The spread
narrowed more than $2 to less than $22 a barrel.
 ICE Brent crude for October delivery , which expires
Thursday, fell 36 cents to settle at $111.89 a barrel. The more
heavily traded November Brent  contract lost 42 cents to
settle at $109.77 a barrel.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher from a
seven-month trough against the dollar on Tuesday, helped by a
rebound in equity prices, but the lower trend looked to remain
as Europe's debt crisis worsened.
 The yen advanced against both the dollar and euro,
suggesting investors remained cautious about taking on risk and
keeping alive the possibility of intervention by Japan to
weaken its currency. The yen has been the primary beneficiary
of safe-haven flows after the Swiss National Bank took
aggressive actions recently to weaken the Swiss franc.
 France on Tuesday confirmed an earlier report that Greek,
German and French leaders would hold a conference call on
Wednesday. The news, combined with a recovery in French bank
shares, boosted the euro.
 But few investors believed the currency's rebound would be
sustained after a disappointing Italian debt auction that saw
borrowing costs soar and as fears persisted that Greece would
default on its debt.
 ""The trend is still down for the euro,"" said Win Thin,
senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York. ""The underlying dynamics for Greece, Italy and all these
guys are still the same, so I remain very negative on euro
zone.""
 The euro last traded at $1.3705 , up 0.3 percent
on the day. It earlier hit a session low of $1.35578 after
Market News International reported China may not buy Italian
debt, countering an earlier report from the Financial Times.
 The euro briefly pared gains after market talk that a Dutch
finance official saw a Greek debt default as unavoidable,
though this was later denied. For details, see [ID:nS1E78C1BI]
 Earlier, the euro came under pressure after the French
president's office said no Franco-German statement on Greece
was planned for Tuesday, dashing hopes that there would be some
kind of support of for the debt-laden country.
 On Monday, the euro had fallen as low as $1.34949, its
weakest since February.
 Against the yen, the single currency fell as low as 104.410
 before moving back to 105.35, down 0.2 percent and
off a 10-year trough of 103.900 yen hit on Monday.

 SELL ON BOUNCE
 Traders said real money remained a seller on rallies, with
small sell-stop orders clustered around the $1.3720/25 level.
 Key levels on the downside in the euro are now the February
low around $1.34280 and the 50 percent retracement of the
euro's June 2010-May 2011 rally around $1.34082.
 Pressure on the euro mounted after Italy paid higher
borrowing costs to sell a new five-year bond. [ID:nL5E7KD1G0]
 Euro stress was also being triggered by persistent talk
that French banks could be downgraded by ratings agencies.
 The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 76.84 yen , while
against a basket of currencies, it slid from Monday's
seven-month high of 77.784 to trade 0.7 percent lower at 77.051
<.DXY>.
 The euro  was little changed against the Swiss
franc at 1.20440 francs, hovering above the 1.2000 level at
which the Swiss National Bank has vowed to rein in the franc.
 ""We still see a lot of risk aversion amongst investors,""
said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy
at BNY Mellon in Boston. ""Fundamentally we're still seeing the
dollar, Swiss and yen being net bought and most of the other
riskier emerging market and G10 currencies being net sold.""

 NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro
edged higher on Tuesday on hopes Europe's top powers will
supply fresh support for Greece, though uncertainty coursed
through markets as the Greek debt crisis remained unresolved.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel sought to quash talk of an
imminent Greek default but market confidence suffered another
blow when Italy had to pay the highest yield since it joined
the euro zone in 1999 to sell five-year bonds. For details

 A Reuters report quoting a Greek government official as
saying that Greek, German and French leaders would hold a
conference call on Wednesday helped buoy the euro and underpin
optimism in European equity markets. Two German government
sources confirmed the plans. [ID:nL5E7KD29C][ID:nB4E7K9007]
 ""The market is still very much focused on the euro. We are
back to watching headlines and it seems like there are more
rumors than fact,"" said David Watt, senior currency strategist,
at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""In general, it's still a very cautious backdrop and it's
hard to see a sustained back-up in the euro and even for that
matter a sustained back-up in the European stock markets,"" he
added.
 The euro  rose 0.1 percent to $1.3676 against the
U.S. dollar. Against the yen the euro fell to a low of 104.37
 before moving back to 105.12, down 0.3 percent.
 European stocks rallied from two-year lows to end higher,
although the sharp rise in Italy's borrowing costs and
simmering fears of a Greek default kept gains in check.

 MSCI's all-country world equity index rose 0.4 percent.
 The Nasdaq and Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose, while the
Dow Jones industrial average fell slightly.
 Brian Battle, a trader at Performance Trust Capital
Partners in Chicago, said stocks were being pulled by those who
see them as overvauled given the economy is on the cusp of
recession, and those who say stocks are historically cheap.
 ""We're going to wrestle around and remain range-bound until
we figure out which theory is true,"" Battle said.

statement on Greece

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell in choppy trade
Tuesday as a report that euro zone politicians may provide some
fresh support to debt laden Greece were denied, and it was set
to stay pressured as the cost of Italy's borrowing reached
unsustainable levels.	
 The euro gave up brief gains to trade down 0.1
percent for the day at $1.3655 after France denied reports that
its President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel would make an announcement about Greece on Tuesday.

 The shared currency remained pressured after hitting
a session low of $1.3557, when Market News International
reported China may not buy Italian debt, countering an earlier
report from the Financial Times.	
 The euro fell 1 percent on the day to 104.41 yen
before moving back to 105.14. On Monday the euro had fallen as
low as $1.3495, its weakest since February, and a 10-year trough
of 103.90 yen.	
 The euro remained burdened after Italy paid higher borrowing
costs to sell a new five-year bond. 
 ""The auction results indicate that demand for Italian paper
has weakened ... so the euro should struggle to extend any
gains,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi.	
 Shares in BNP Paribas fell 7.5 percent at one
stage on Tuesday, prompting the French bank to categorically
deny comments about its funding attributed to an anonymous
source in the Wall Street Journal. The bank described its U.S.
dollar funding as solid and strong. 
 
Technical analysts see more losses for the euro after its
short-covering rally on Monday and Tuesday stalled ahead of the
100-week moving average at $1.3739. Near-term resistance was the
Ichimoku cloud top around $1.3707.	
 Key levels on the downside are now the February low around
$1.3426 and the 50 percent retracement of the euro's 2010-2011
rally around $1.3407. 
 The dollar slipped back from Monday's 7-month high versus a
currency basket of 77.784 , while it eased 0.3 percent to
77.00 yen .	
 The U.S. currency has held in a slim range roughly between
76.40 and 77.60 with markets wary of more yen-weakening
intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 The euro was little changed versus the safe-haven
Swiss franc at 1.2030 francs, hovering above the 1.2000 at which
the Swiss National Bank has vowed to defend the ailing euro.	
 ""I would keep a close eye on euro/Swiss as it's close to the
1.20 minimum band and suspect it's falling under a few people's
radar,"" said a London-based trader.	
 ""I wouldn't rule out the SNB stepping in again which would
of course squeeze intra-day euro shorts.""	
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars
both struggled against their U.S. counterpart, while the Swedish
and Norwegian crowns remained weak after selling off sharply
against the euro on Monday.	
 All four currencies are considered to be relatively high
risk as their economies track the broad health of the global
economy, and tend to depreciate during times of uncertainty.

fears grow
 * Report of planned Franco-German statement on Greece denied
 * Euro weakens versus dollar, yen
 * Italian yields rise after disappointing auction

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise	
 LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell and European
stocks erased gains on Tuesday after France denied it and
Germany would make a statement on the euro zone's crisis,
deepening concerns of a Greek debt default.	
 Wall Street   was also on course to open lower
as the United States voiced concern at the euro zone's inability
to deal with debt problems many worry may now spur another
banking crisis.	
 A French government source said German Chancellor Angela
Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy were ""determined to do what
is necessary"" and were ""going to take action today"" but the
French President's office later denied a joint statement was
planned.	
 Market attention for much of the morning centred on an
auction of Italian five-year bonds which saw it pay the highest
interest since it joined the euro, compounding fears about the
currency bloc's third largest economy. 
 ""People are coming back and focusing on Greece and Italy. It
was a relief rally, but it feels like many are looking to sell
on any strength. It is very difficult for bulls to hang on
there,"" Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said. 
 European shares had opened higher after a Financial Times
report that Italy had asked China to buy its debt. Another media
report poured cold water on those expectations.	
 But Italian five-year yields at the auction soared to their
highest since the euro's launch in 1999. 
 The pan-European share index was last little
changed on the day while the MSCI world equity index
was marginally firmer.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index has dropped more than 21 percent
in 2011 as the world economy and euro zone crisis worsened and
investors cut exposure to riskier assets such as stocks.	
 ""Markets want to see decisive action and they want to see
someone in control of the situation,"" Monument Securities
strategist Marc Ostwald said. ""Nothing that we've had, be it at
a domestic level in Italy, be it at a pan euro zone level, or
above all from Germany, indicates that anyone really is getting
to grips with presenting euro zone policy with one voice."" 
 
 The euro gave up brief gains to trade 0.2 percent
down against the dollar at $1.3643 and looked set to stay under
pressure on growing worries that Italy's borrowing costs could
be heading for unsustainable levels.	
It was down 0.5 percent against the yen at 104.97 yen
, not far from a session low of 104.37 yen earlier.	
""The auction results indicate that demand for Italian paper
has weakened and it's not a supportive development for the
euro,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi. 
 
 ""RUNNING FOR THE HILLS""	
 Italian two-year yields were up 14 basis points
at 4.74 percent while five-year debt yielded 5.42
percent, up 25 bps. 
 Greek two-year yields surged to 88 percent ,
making clear investors believe a default was all but inevitable
within that period .	
 ""There is a weakness at the heart of the euro zone and
Greece is under a remarkable degree of pressure...If Germany are
preparing a plan B it looks as though the people running the
show are running for the hills and that's not going to improve
confidence,"" said Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire.	
 Oil pared earlier gains after the International Energy
Agency cut its estimate for demand growth and raised its supply
forecast. The IEA, which advises 28 industrialised countries on
policy, said slowing economic growth had led the agency to cut
its oil demand growth forecast by 160,000 barrels per day for
2011 and by 190,000 bpd for 2012. 
 U.S. crude  was last 0.8 percent up at $88.92 a
barrel, off an early high of $89.21 while Brent  was
little changed at $112.35 a barrel.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The euro held firm on Tuesday
after a choppy session overnight saw a wave of short-covering
lift it by more than two cents on hopes that China will bolster
Italy by buying its bonds, but traders found few reasons to stay
upbeat about the currency.	
 Mounting fears of a Greek default, a surge in Italian bond
yields and steep falls in French bank shares due to their
sovereign exposure and amid talk of a possible cuts to their
ratings kept sentiment overwhelmingly bearish.	
 The euro climbed to around $1.3686 against the dollar after
falling to a seven-month low of $1.3495 in the previous session,
though weak demand at an Italian bond auction later in the day
may see the single currency drop back again.	
 ""All eyes are squarely on that seven-month low around $1.35
hit overnight,"" said Koji Fukaya, director of global
foreign exchange research at Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 ""The downtrend in the euro will surely continue, but my
sense is that unless the Italian bond auction goes extremely
badly, this level may hold today,"" he said.	
 Italy is offering up to 7 billion euros of long-term paper,
with the auction in focus after the previous long-term sale drew
tepid demand and as the spread of Italian bond yields over
German Bunds rose close to a peak around 400 bps hit in August.	
 On top of that, any weakness in inflation data from France
and Spain also out later in the day could fire up expectations
that the European Central Bank may cut interest rates.	
 Markets are also trying to price in a possible ratings
downgrade on France's top banks, as well as an Italian sovereign
rating cut. Moody's warned on June 17 that it may cut Italy's
credit rating in the next 90 days.	
 Chart-wise, the euro looks heavy after a short-covering
rally stalled ahead of the top on the weekly Ichimoku cloud at
$1.3705 and the 100-week moving average at $1.3739.	
 ""Having failed to bounce back above $1.37, the euro has
become extremely vulnerable on the charts. I wouldn't get my
hopes up for the auction -- the euro is still a sell,"" said a
trader for a Japanese bank who spoke on condition of anonymity.	
 But the trader also said that the euro is oversold in the
short term and may find some immediate support having fallen
about nine cents, or 6 percent, in two weeks from a high of
around $1.4548 on Aug. 29.	
 It is now trading on the verge of the lower Bollinger Band,
at $1.3646, and its 14-day relative strength index is hovering
around the 30 mark, which is considered to be oversold
territory, for the first time in more than nine months.	
 
 
 KNOCK OUT	
 The Financial Times reported that Italy had asked China to
make ""significant"" purchases of Italian debt. Italy has seen its
borrowing costs spike in recent weeks on doubts about the
political will in Rome to tackle its swollen
debt. 
 Against the yen, the euro fell 0.1 percent to 105.40 yen
, but was off a 10-year trough plumbed on Monday at
103.90 yen.	
 Some traders said that the fall through 105.00 and 104.00 in
euro/yen overnight has knocked out some Japanese exporter
hedges, and that heading into the fiscal half-year end at the
end of September they may have to re-sell the common currency.	
 Risk reversals also showed increasing demand for bets on a
lower euro, with the 25 delta one-month euro/yen risk
reversal rising to levels not seen in over a
year, trading around 4.4 in favour of euro puts. 
 Market players are cautiously awaiting U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner's return trip to Europe on Friday
where he will attend a meeting of EU finance ministers to
discuss efforts to boost global recovery and cooperate on
financial regulation. 
 The dollar came off seven-month highs against major
currencies , falling 0.7 percent to 77.07 after Japanese
exporters were detected selling it, helping lift
dollar-denominated commodities such as gold, copper and crude
oil.	
 Dollar/yen slipped from a one-month high set on Friday and
fell 0.3 percent to 77.02 yen . It has held in a slim
range roughly between 76.40 and 77.60 with markets wary of more
yen-weakening intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 The Australian dollar staged a lukewarm rebound,
bolstered by the softer dollar and rebounding Japanese equities,
but failed to pop back above the 200-day moving average at
$1.0385. It last traded at $1.0369.

Earlier Monday, the U.K. Financial Times reported that China was in talks with Italian officials regarding an injection of funds, including the purchase of bonds and investments in strategic companies.
Last week, a delegation from the China Investment Corp., one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, visited Italy for a meeting with Italian government officials, including Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti.
Seperately, European Central Bank President Jean-Cluade Trichet said Monday, it remains his “working assumption” that Greece would take the steps needed to win approval from the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission to receive its next batch of funding.
Trichet’s comments followed a Wall Street Journal report that International Monetary Fund officials said Greece would receive its next round of bailout funds later this month
Wall Street shares pieced together a late session rally to rebound from session lows, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.63%, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.1%, and the S&P 500 edged up 0.7%.
Meanwhile, the greenback was lower against the British pound, with GBP/USD up by 0.02% to hit 1.5866. 
The dollar was lower against the Japanese yen but down against the Swiss franc with USD/JPY dropping 0.24% to hit 77.03, and USD/CHF up fractionally by 0.02% to hit 0.8804.

In mid-day Asian trade USD/JPY hit 77.05, the pair’s lowest since last Tuesday ; the pair subsequently consolidated at 77.10, dropping 0.15%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.29, the low of August 11, and resistance at 77.70, last Wednesday’s high.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 13 (Reuters) - European index futures
rose and the euro edged off a seven-month low on Tuesday
after a report that Italy may get financial support from China
sparked a bout of short-covering but did nothing to ease fears
that Europe is sliding into another banking crisis.	
 Asian shares staged a modest rebound, but growing
expectations of a Greek debt default, sharp drops in French bank
shares on Monday due to their sovereign exposure and a surge in
Italian bond yields meant sentiment remained fragile and any
rally was likely to be short lived.	
 ""There are still enormous challenges facing the European
system at this point and fears around a default in Greece are
very high and it's hard to see that changing any time soon,""
said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS in Sydney.	
 The dollar eased broadly, helping lift dollar-denominated
commodities such as gold, copper and crude oil.	
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  rose 1.1
percent, and DAX  and CAC-40  futures were also up
more than 1 percent , while financial
bookmakers called the FTSE 100 to open up as much as 1.4
percent . 
 
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1
percent and Australia's benchmark index gained 0.9
percent, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares
outside Japan was flat . 
 The MSCI index is nearly 20 percent below its 2011 high
reached in April. A fall of 20 percent or more is the generally
accepted definition of a bear market.	
 U.S. stocks bounced back late in Monday's session after a
report that Italy could get financial support from China
tempered investors' worst fears over the euro zone debt crisis.

 S&P 500 index futures  were flat in Asia on
Tuesday, suggesting Wall Street's gains may run out of
steam. 
 Market sell-offs like those of the last six weeks -- driven
by the euro zone crisis and fears of renewed recession in the
United States -- are often punctuated by ""short-covering""
rallies, when traders buy to realise profits on bets that an
asset would fall in price.	
 
 EURO CRISIS	
 The Financial Times reported that Italy had asked China to
make ""significant"" purchases of Italian debt. Italy has seen its
borrowing costs spike in recent weeks on doubts about the
political will in Rome to tackle its swollen
debt. 
 Greece warned on Monday it would run out of cash next month
without the next tranche, around 8 billion euros, of a bailout
loan. Euro zone policymakers have threatened to withhold the
money as patience with Athens' repeated fiscal slippages wears
thin. 
 A growing number of policymakers, as well as market
economists, are convinced it is only a matter of time before
Greece, which keeps falling behind on its fiscal targets after
two EU/IMF bailouts, will have to default. 
 ""The contagion impact of a default will be severe, because
next in the firing line will be Italy, Spain and it will take in
the whole of the European banking sector too,"" Suki Mann, a
strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a note.	
 In currency markets, the euro inched up to around
$1.3670 against the dollar after falling to a seven-month
low of $1.3495 in the previous session, though any signs of weak
demand at an Italian bond auction later in the day may see the
single currency fall back again. 
 ""All eyes are squarely on that seven-month low
around $1.35 hit overnight,"" said Koji Fukaya, director of
global foreign exchange research at Credit Suisse Securities in
Tokyo. 
""The downtrend in the euro will surely continue, but my sense
is that unless the Italian bond auction goes extremely badly,
this level may hold today."" 
 The dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency
against a basket of major peers, fell 0.6 percent .

 The weaker greenback made dollar-denominated assets cheaper
for holders of other currencies.	
 Copper rose 1 percent to $8,840 a tonne
and oil also gained, with U.S. crude  up 0.7 percent
at $88.85 a barrel and Brent crude  rising 0.5 percent to
$112.81 , although traders remained wary. 
 ""This is a shallow bounce because of Wall Street ending
higher, so there is some confidence returning, but I don't think
anybody would be putting any big positions given the global
situation,"" said Victor Say, an analyst at Informa Global
Markets in Singapore.	
 Gold bounced about 0.8 percent to around $1,828
an ounce, after dropping by more than 2.5 percent in the
previous session, also supported by the safe-haven appeal that
drove it to a record high of $1,920.30 last week. 
 ""There is a slow-motion train wreck going on in Europe at
the moment, which is going to be relatively supportive of gold,""
said Nick Trevethan, senior commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 ""All the factors that have been supporting gold for the past
few months are still there. Nothing has changed.""

1257,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2011 07:40PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD dips in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro moved lower against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Tuesday, on fresh concerns over European sovereign debt and a possible downgrade to French banks due to exposure to Greek outstanding loans.
EUR/USD hit 1.3660 in early Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since Friday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3676, easing 0.03%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3526, the low of February 22, and resistance at 1.3937, last Friday’s high.
Speaking from a meeting of central bankers in Basel, Switzerland, European Central Bank President Jean-Cluade Trichet, earlier Monday, addressed mounting worries that Greece was in danger of a near default saying,”We are calling upon the Greek government with great firmness.” 
“It is in the interest of Greece and for the long-term prosperity of this country. I don’t think there is any doubt that if they confirm all their commitments, they would be in a better situation,” Trichet added.
Trichet said it remains his “working assumption” that Greece would take the steps needed to win approval from the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission to receive its next batch of funding.
Weighing on the euro was a report over the weekend by Bloomberg News that three French banks were vulnerable to a downgrade from Moody’s Investor service because of their exposure to Greece’s sovereign debt.
Slumping bank issues on European markets pulled stocks lower in Monday trade, with France’s CAC 40 dropping 4.02% to 2,854.81, Britain’s FTSE 100 falling 1.63% to 5,129.62, and Germany’s DAX declining by 2.27% to end the session at 5,072.33.
The euro has lost 5.5% against the U.S. dollar this month on continued worries about European debt, and Trichet has indicated that the ECB may not be raising interest rates again any time soon, eliminating a major support for the shared currency.
The announced resignation of ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark last Friday, sent the euro to its lowest point since February.
Wall Street shares recovered from session lows after a report in the Financial Times indicated that China was considering a purchase of Italian bonds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.63% to 11,061.12, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.1% to 2,495.09, and the S&P 500 edged up 0.7% to close at 1,162.27.
Meanwhile, the euro was lower against the British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP down by 0.15% to hit 0.8609, and EUR/JPY falling 0.20% to hit 105.40.
Investor focus was expected to turn to the release of monthly retail sales figures by the U.S. Census Bureau scheduled for later in the week.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks staged a late-day
rally and the euro rose on Monday, rebounding from a global
rout, after news that China might bolster Italy with financial
support tempered fears of a Greek debt default and contagion.
 The euro, which earlier had slid to a seven-month low
against the U.S. dollar, recovered all its losses and gained on
a report by the Financial Times, which said Italy had asked
China to make ""significant"" purchases of Italian debt.
 U.S. Treasuries widened losses, which had been narrow
before the news, while Wall Street stocks erased losses of more
than 1 percent to turn higher, further depleting the safe-haven
demand for U.S. government debt.
 ""It shows the Chinese are serious about addressing the
stresses in the marketplace,"" said Robert Van Batenburg, head
of equity research at Louis Capital in New York.
 Before the news of potential Chinese financial support
turned markets around, investors had braced for a possible
credit downgrade of France's top banks by Moody's Investors
Service.
 The euro was last at $1.3678, up 0.2 percent on the day,
well off a session trough of $1.34949 , its lowest
since February, on trading platform EBS.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes , which
had been down 2/32 in price in early afternoon trading, were
down 10/32 after the report. Their yield rose to 1.96 percent.
 Sentiment had improved during the session on assurances
from France that it could withstand a crisis that has dried up
credit in the euro zone and kept jitters high through the
summer. For details see: [ID:nP6E7G301A] [nP6E7JV045]

1,162.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 27.10 points,
or 1.10 percent, at 2,495.09.
 Investors had sold assets perceived as risky earlier in the
session and bought government debt. The yield on benchmark U.S.
Treasury 10-year notes briefly slid to the lowest level in at
least 60 years at one point.
 The governor of the Bank of France, Christian Noyer, later
said French banks have no liquidity or solvency problems and
that they can withstand any crisis event in Greece.
 Mounting fears of a Greek debt default and concerns after
the surge in Italian bond yields earlier prompted investors to

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell to seven-month
lows against the dollar on Monday and could stay under pressure
this week on fears of a Greek debt default and a possible
rating downgrade of French banks.
 The yen surged to a 10-year peak versus the euro and rose
against the dollar as investors sought safe havens, heightening
the risk of intervention by Japanese authorities.
 Greece's credit default swaps hit new highs, while the
spread between Greek and German 10-year bond yields increased
to a record as investors feared the prospect of repeated fiscal
slippage would cause Athens to lose aid and default on its
debt.
 That also raised worries about French banks, which
reportedly have some of the biggest exposure to Greek debt.
Sources said on Saturday that Moody's may downgrade France's
banks, although France's finance minister said the lenders were
solid enough to cope with any Greek crisis. [ID:nP6E7G301A]
 ""With the intense negative feedback loops between the
sovereign bonds and the banks' balance sheets, it is no longer
clear to me that there are clean solutions to the problems in
Europe, except for the introduction of a Eurobond,"" said
Stephen Jen, managing partner of SLJ Macro Partners LLP in
London.
 ""I see a drastic deterioration in general sentiment
regarding the European debt and banking crisis in the coming
weeks,"" he added.
 The euro fell as low as $1.34949 , its lowest
since February, on trading platform EBS and was last at
$1.3604, down 0.4 percent on the day. Traders said it came off
lows on bargain-hunting from European funds and sovereign
investors, but analysts expected further falls.
 ""We don't see a reversal in the euro until we get back
above $1.38,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Against the yen, the euro fell to 103.86 yen , its
lowest in 10 years, according to Reuters data, having broken
below big option triggers at 105 yen and 104.50 yen. It was
last at 105.19 yen, down 0.6 percent on the day.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 77.33 yen , not
far from its record low of about 75.941 yen struck in
mid-August. Japan last intervened on Aug. 4 to weaken the yen.
 BEARISH BETS ON EURO
 Risk reversal spreads for euro/yen rose to their widest in
over a year in favor of euro puts, suggesting investors are
betting on further declines in the European common currency.
 One-month and three-month euro/dollar risk reversals also
showed a record high bias for euro puts. 

 The latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed speculators added to bearish bets against the
euro in the week to Sept. 6. Net short positions stood at
36,443 contracts, up from 384 contracts. [IMM/FX]
 Christian von Strachwitz, chief investment officer at
Quaesta Capital in Switzerland, said short euro/dollar
positions dominated the latest week's portfolio, with the
greenback having the largest inflows. The Canadian dollar,
meanwhile, showed the largest outflows.
 Quaesta is a currency fund of funds with assets of $3
billion.
 The Australian dollar, seen as a barometer of risk
appetite, fell to a 1-month low of US$1.0256  as
investors fretted that the global economy could be dealt a blow
if euro zone debt woes deepen. It last traded at US$1.0281,
down 1.8 percent.
 The Canadian dollar fell to the lowest in more than 7
months versus the greenback, although it recovered in the New
York session. The U.S. dollar was last down 0.1 percent at
C$0.9961 .

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Fears of a Greek default that
could spread widely through global markets dragged down stocks
on Monday, knocking European equities to two-year lows, and
sent the euro to a seven-month low against the dollar.
 Concerns that Moody's Investors Service could downgrade the
credit-worthiness of French banks, which are widely exposed to
Greek bonds, and the lack of a solution to Greece's debt
problem rattled investor confidence.
 Assurances from France that it can withstand the crisis
helped the euro to steady.
 Investors dumped assets perceived as risky and bought
government debt. The yield on benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year
notes briefly slid to their lowest levels in at least six
decades ago and 10-year Bund yields  fell to 1.71
percent.
 ""The fear goes well beyond Greece. The yields at Italy's
T-bill auction today surged, signaling that contagion is real,""
said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at
French broker Global Equities.
 Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said French banks
have no liquidity or solvency problems and that they can
withstand any crisis event in Greece. [ID:nP6E7JV045]
 Some analysts downplayed the risks.
 ""A Greek default is probably a long way away, and my view
is that as long as Greece is showing it is willing and able to
initiate measures deemed satisfactory, you won't see any
refusal to provide funds,"" said Ray Attrill, senior currency
strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 But fear gripped most markets.
 The euro fell as low as $1.34949 , its lowest
since February, and then pared losses to see-saw near
break-even. It was up 0.2 percent at $1.3597.

 NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Fears of a Greek default and
credit contagion ripped through markets on Monday, tumbling
European shares to their lowest in more than two years and the
euro to a seven-month low against the U.S. dollar.
 Concerns that Moody's Investors Service could downgrade the
credit-worthiness of French banks and the lack of a solution to
Greece's debt problem undermined investor confidence and the
appetite for risk. For details see: [ID:nS1E78B08A]
 Safe-haven buying briefly pushed yields on benchmark U.S.
Treasury 10-year notes to lows last seen at least six decades
ago and 10-year Bund yields fell to 1.73 percent.
 The euro later rebounded from its low to trade up almost
0.8 percent at $1.3673 to the dollar.
 Shares of French banks Societe Generale , Credit
Agricole  and BNP Paribas  slumped about 10
percent amid expectations of an imminent downgrade, due largely
to their exposure to Greek bonds. [ID:nL5E7KC1TV]
 Adding to the gloom was the failure of a weekend meeting of
finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations to generate fresh proposals for boosting global growth.
[ID:nN1E78728T] [ID:nL5E7KC0KE]
 ""There was hope there would be something more resolute out
of the G7 meeting over the weekend,"" said Ian King, head of
international equities at Legal & General, which has 356
billion pounds ($566 billion) under management.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares fell 3.2 percent, after earlier slumping to 883.04, its
lowest since July 2009. The index has lost more than 20 percent
in 2011.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell
1.5 percent.
 On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 16.87 points, or 0.15 percent, to 10,975.26. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> shed 0.06 points, or 0.01 percent, to
1,154.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 12.13
points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,480.12.
 Global central bankers meeting in Basel, Switzerland said
economic growth is slowing but there is no sign of a worldwide
recession and they had no plans for concerted action.
[ID:nL5E7KC1XY]
 Brent crude oil  fell as much as $1.60 per barrel to
a low of $110.17. U.S. crude  slid 72 cents to a low of
$86.52.
 ""There are fears about the slowing economy, fears about the
debt, fears about default and we are not having coordinated
multilateral actions being taken; we are having the opposite,""
said analyst Robin Bhar of Credit Agricole.
 U.S. government debt prices were lower. The benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 5/32 in price
to yield 1.93 percent.
 Against the yen, the euro fell to 103.90 yen , its
lowest in 10 years, according to Reuters data.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.10 percent at 77.118.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.48
percent at 77.18 as the Japanese currency benefitted from
safe-haven buying.
 Spot gold prices  fell $25.21 to $1,832.10 an ounce.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - World shares tumbled 2 percent
on Monday with European equities down 3 percent for a more than
20 percent loss this year as investors worried Greece was edging
closer to default.	
 Japan's Nikkei closed at a 2-1/2 year low and Wall
Street looked set for sharp losses.	
 Yields on long-term core euro zone debt, home to safety
plays during times of strife, fell sharply and the euro slumped
against the dollar and yen.	
 The cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against
default rose, to record levels for Greece and Portugal, while
Italy saw its cost of borrowing over 12 months surge at a
treasury bill sale.	
 Markets were partly reacting to the failure over the weekend
of the Group of Seven industrialised nations' finance ministers
to come up with more than a stated commitment to help turn the
world economy around.	
 But they were mainly focused on the euro zone debt crisis.	
 ""Europe is not just lurching from one crisis to another. It
is lurching into a new one before the previous one is solved,""
said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst was down 3.1 percent.	
 German policymaker Juergen Stark's resignation from the
European Central Bank's board on Friday underscored internal
divisions over its bond-buying programme -- one of the bank's
main weapons to fight the debt crisis, by forcing down yields on
debt of countries under pressure from the bond markets.

 Fears about a Greek default rose last week after senior
politicians in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right
coalition started talking openly about it. 
 International lenders threatened last week to withhold a
sixth bailout payment of about 8 billion euros ($11 billion)
because of repeated fiscal slippage and Athens said on Monday
that it has cash for only a few more weeks. . 
 The government announced on Sunday a new property tax to
make sure it would meet its budget targets and qualify for the
tranche.	
 ""The Greek situation is dominant, chances of some sort of
default have increased -- the Germans seem to be hinting at
that,"" one bond trader in Europe said.

 EURO SINKS	
 The euro dived to a seven-month low against the U.S. dollar
and a 10-year trough versus the yen.	
 ""The outlook for Greece is almost completely unknown.
Support for the country appears to be shaking. The market is
starting to think the worst could happen,"" said Katsunori
Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking. 
""It's as if policymakers are starting to prepare for that,""
Kitakura said.	
 The euro fell as low as $1.34949 , its lowest since
February, before recovering to around $1.3634.	
 On bond markets, Italian and Spanish government bond yields
rose, feeling the pressure of upcoming debt supply and the
rising concern over Greece.

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a seven-month
low against the U.S. dollar and a 10-year trough versus the yen
on Monday, hurt by fears of a Greek default and the risk of
contagion engulfing the region's banking system and larger
economies.	
 The yen was a big beneficiary of safe-haven inflows, keeping
alive the risk of intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 Italian and Spanish yields rose, widening their spreads over
German Bunds, while European stocks and banking shares fell,
highlighting how brittle investor confidence was in euro zone
assets. 
 The common currency fell as low as $1.34949 , its
lowest since February before recovering to $1.3633, still down
0.2 percent on the day on top of a 1.6 percent fall on Friday.
It came off lows on bargain hunting from European funds and
sovereign investors, but analysts expected further falls.	
 ""Bargain hunting has lifted the euro a bit higher in the
European session but clearly it is vulnerable to downside risks
in the coming days and weeks,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank. ""Investors will look to fade (sell) into
rallies.""	
 Against the yen, the euro fell 1.7 percent to 103.90 yen
, its lowest in 10 years, having broken below big
option triggers at 105 yen and 104.50 yen. It was last at 104.91
yen, down 1 percent on the day.	
 The Japanese last intervened in the currency market on Aug
4 to topple the yen from record highs against the dollar. The
dollar was last down 0.75 percent at 76.99 yen , not far
from its record low of around 75.94 yen struck in mid-August.	
 The Australian dollar, seen as a barometer of market
players' risk appetite, fell more than 1.5 percent to a 1-month
low of $1.0276 as investors fretted that the global
economy could be dealt a blow if euro zone debt woes deepen.	
 
 BEARISH BETS ON EURO	
 As market players bet on a further fall in the euro against
the yen, risk reversal spreads for euro/yen rose to their widest
in over a year in favour of euro puts, or bets on the euro
falling. One-month and three-month euro/dollar risk reversals
also showed a fresh record high bias for euro puts.
.	
 Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators have added to their bearish bets against the
euro in the latest week to Sept. 6. Net short positions stood at
36,443 contracts, up from 384 contracts. 
 Although traders said the euro may have been oversold in the
very short term, market commentators saw plenty of room for more
falls, particularly once it breaks below $1.35.	
 ""We have become more pessimistic on the outlook for the euro
zone and on European policymakers' ability to tackle the
crisis,"" said Colin Harte, director of currency and fixed income
at Barings Asset Management, which has around $40 million in
currency hedge funds.	
 ""Short-term the euro selling might be a little overdone, but
the problem is still there,"" he said, adding the euro ""could
easily touch $1.30"" if the situation in the euro zone does not
improve. 
 Concerns about a Greek default rose after senior politicians
in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition
started talking openly about a possible default. 
 This came after Juergen Stark's surprise departure from the
European Central Bank last week highlighted major disagreement
among policymakers. Meanwhile, markets were bracing for possible
ratings downgrade on France's top banks, as well as Italy's
sovereign rating. 
 ""For now market confidence in the political leadership has
collapsed and unless they step in to back stop the banking
system, it will be only a matter of time before the $1.35 level
in the euro is attacked,"" said Lena Komileva, senior vice
president, foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman.	
 The euro's sell-off started last week after European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet shifted the monetary stance
from a hawkish bias to a more neutral one. 
 The euro's broad losses helped the dollar index rise
to its highest level in over six months. It was last up 0.1
percent at 77.237 with strong resistance at the 38.2 percent
retracement of the index's fall from a high of 88.71 on June 7,
2010 to a low of 72.696 on May 4, 2011 which comes in at 78.80.	
 With commodity currencies under pressure, the Canadian
dollar also fell to a seven-month low against the U.S. dollar
.

 LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - World shares tumbled nearly 2
percent on Monday with European equities at 26-month lows, down
more than 20 percent this year, as investors worried Greece
would default amid signs of rifts among euro zone policymakers.	
 Japan's Nikkei closed at a 2-1/2 year low.	
 Yields on long-term core euro zone debt, home to safety
plays during times of strife, fell sharply and the euro slumped

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The euro dived to a seven-month
low against the U.S. dollar and a 10-year trough versus the yen,
falling below key technical levels and option barriers on
worries that the euro zone's support for Greece is wobbling and
that the country may be forced to default on its debt.	
 The Australian dollar, sometimes seen as a barometer of
market players' risk appetite, tumbled 1.5 percent in Asia to a
three-week low, below its 200-day moving average, as investors
fret that the global economy will be dealt a severe blow if the
euro zone's debt woes deepen.	
 ""The outlook for Greece is almost completely unknown.
Support for the country appears to be shaking. The market is
starting to think the worst could happen,"" said Katsunori
Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.	
 ""It's as if policymakers are starting to prepare for that,""
Kitakura said.	
 Fears about a Greek default rose after senior politicians in
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition started
talking openly about it. 
 This came on top of Juergen Stark's surprise departure from
the European Central Bank last week, which has highlighted major
disagreement among top policymakers on how to tackle the
region's debt problem.	
 The common currency fell as low as $1.34949 , its
lowest since February. It last traded at $1.3520, down 1 percent
on the day on top of a 1.6 percent fall on Friday.	
 The currency has clearly dropped below $1.3655, a 61.2
percent retracement of its rally to $1.4940 in May from $1.2860
in January.	
 Against the yen, it fell 1.6 percent to 104.10 yen
, its lowest in 10 years, having broken below big
option triggers at 105 yen and 104.50 yen.	
 The euro could fall to around 99.20 yen, its fair value
based on purchasing power parity, said Makoto Noji, senior
strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, noting that there are few
technical support levels after 108.08, a 76.4 percent
retracement of its rally from 2000 to 2008, is broken.	
 ""Europe is not just lurching from one crisis to another. It
is lurching into a new one before the previous one is solved,""
Noji said.	
 Markets are also bracing for possible ratings downgrade on
France's top banks, as well as Italy's sovereign rating. Moody's
warned on June 17 that it may cut Italy's credit ratings in the
next 90 days.	
 ""By Friday at the latest, it is likely Italy will have their
Aa2 rating from Moody's lowered ... Moody's rating of Italy is
currently two notches below AAA, compared with three notches
with Fitch and four notches with S&P, this can be seen as
catch-up,"" Richard Kelly, head of European rates and FX research
at TD Securities wrote in a note.	
 In the very near-term, the euro could be oversold, trading
way below the lower Bollinger Band, now at $1.3711. Its 14-day
relative strength index has fallen below the 30 mark, which is
considered to be oversold territory, for the first time in more
than nine months.	
 Still, the euro looks vulnerable, especially against the
yen, after having fallen below its 2010 low around 105.50 yen to
hit its lowest in more than 10 years.	
 As market players bet on a further fall in the euro against
the yen, risk reversal spreads for the euro/yen rose to their
widest in over a year in favour of euro puts.	
 
 ABOVE THE FLOOR	
 But the euro was little changed against the Swiss franc at
1.2040 franc , above the 1.20 franc floor the Swiss
central bank set last week as few market players tried to test
the resolve of the Swiss authorities.	
 With the Swiss franc no longer a safe harbour due to Swiss
National Bank selling, and the yen also dogged by the danger of
intervention from Japan's authorities, the greenback became the
best performer among major currencies.	
""For now, your best bet is a higher U.S. dollar against most
currencies, but in particular against the euro and commodity
currencies,"" said Joseph Capurso, strategist at Commonwealth
Bank in Sydney. The dollar index rose as far as 77.784,
its highest in almost seven months.	
 Against the yen, however, the dollar slipped 0.6 percent to
77.12 , falling from a one-month high around 77.88 set on
Friday, dragged down by selling in euro/yen.	
 Commodity currencies were under pressure on Monday with the
Australian dollar falling 1.6 percent to a three-week
low around $1.0340, having dropped below its 200-day moving
average of $1.0383.	
 While the Aussie did recover from its brief foray below the
average last month, a large amount of long positions accumulated
over many months thanks to its yield advantage point to a risk
of more unwinding.	
 According to the data from the U.S. financial watchdog,
speculators at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange held on to a
large net long position in the Australian dollar of around A$4.8
billion.	
 Trade was choppy with volumes likely to be thinner than
usual as several centres in Asia, including China, are closed
for a holiday.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 12 (Reuters) - European index futures
tumbled on Monday, following a slide in Asian equities, and the
euro slumped to a 10-year low against the yen after the
resignation of a top European Central Bank official cast further
doubt on the region's ability to tackle its worsening sovereign
debt crisis.	
 Oil and copper prices fell and the dollar gained broadly as
worries about the euro zone's woes combined with fears about
flagging world growth to ensure no let-up in the gloom that has
gripped global markets for much of the past six weeks.	
 ""People are quite nervous about Greece and other countries
in the European area, so that is why investors are escaping to
the dollar,"" said Tetsu Emori, a fund manager at Tokyo-based
Astmax Co Ltd. ""It's risk aversion.""	
 Euro STOXX 50 index futures  fell 2.7 percent, and
DAX  and CAC-40  futures also dropped more than 2
percent, while financial bookmakers called the FTSE 100
to open down 1.4 percent. 
 German policymaker Juergen Stark's resignation from the
ECB's board underscored the internal divisions over its
bond-buying programme -- one of the central bank's main weapons
in fighting the debt crisis by forcing down yields of country's
under pressure from the bond markets. 
 
 Japan's Nikkei ended down 2.3 percent to its lowest
close since April 2009, while the MSCI's broadest index of Asia
Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 3 percent
and U.S. index futures traded in Asia  fell 1.3 percent.	
 ""For the rest of the week, developments in euro zone debt
problems and movements in the euro will likely set the direction
of the market,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at
Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.	
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday, when the Stark news
broke, with the S&P 500 index falling 2.7 percent. 
 Data from fund tracker Lipper, a Thomson Reuters service,
showed that a brief flirtation with stocks at the end of August
has waned, with less than a net $600 million flowing into U.S.
equity funds in the week ended Sept. 7, compared with a net
inflow of $6.3 billion in the previous week.	
 MSCI's All-Country World index is now 19
percent below its 2011 high set in May, not far from the 20
percent decline that is the rule-of-thumb definition of a bear
market.	
 The fund flow picture for emerging Asian equity markets was
mixed. Citigroup analysts said in a note that China and
Indonesia had seen modest net inflows for the week to Sept. 7.
The biggest outflows were from regional funds and the cyclical
markets of South Korea and Taiwan.	
 
 GREEK DEFAULT	
 Adding to the euro zone's difficulties, top French banks
were bracing for credit rating downgrades on worries about their
sovereign debt exposure, and senior German politicians in
Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition began talking
openly about a Greek default. 
 A growing number of policymakers, as well as market
economists, are convinced it is only a matter of time before
Greece, which keeps falling behind on its fiscal targets after
two EU/IMF bailouts, will have to default.	
 ""The outlook for Greece is almost completely unknown.
Support for the country appears to be shaking. The market is
starting to think the worst could happen,"" said Katsunori
Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.	
 The euro fell to a six-month low around $1.3495 and
later traded about $1.3530, after a sharp slide at the end of
last week. Against the yen, the single currency fell as far as
104.27 , its lowest since 2001.	
 Meanwhile, the dollar index , which tracks the
greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose around 0.6
percent to its highest in more than six months. 
 U.S. crude oil  fell by $1.59 to $85.64 a barrel and
Brent crude  eased $1.32 to $111.45. Copper was
down 1 percent at $8,733.75 a tonne. 
 Both commodities are sensitive to expectations for global
growth, and hence industrial demand.	
 Currencies of major commodity producers were, in turn, under
pressure, with the Australian dollar falling more than
1 percent to a three-week low around $1.0330.	
 Gold , which has been striking a succession of records
due to its traditional appeal as a safe haven at times of market
volatility, fell 0.6 percent to around $1,846 an ounce as a
stronger dollar made it more expensive for holders of other
currencies. 
 Gold priced in euros , however, hit a record
1,373.92 an ounce.	
 Japanese government bonds tracked gains in U.S. Treasuries
and German bunds as investors sought the perceived safest
government debt, with the benchmark 10-year JGB yield

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Growing doubts about Europe's
ability to resolve its debt crisis punished the euro and world
stock markets on Friday, while G7 finance ministers met to
discuss measures to revive economic growth.
 The euro hit 6-1/2 month lows against the U.S. dollar on
nervousness over the outcome of a Greek debt swap deal and on
jitters fueled by the planned resignation of Juergen Stark, the
top German on the European Central Bank's board, in protest
over its controversial bond-buying program.
 Bond buying has been one of the ECB's main weapons in
fighting the debt crisis. The Stark news kindled uncertainty
over internal ECB support for it and pummeled the euro, a day
after a sell-off on the ECB backing away from further interest
rate rises.
 The nervousness fueled safe-haven buying of German and U.S.
government debt. The 10-year Bund yield hit another record low,
while 10-year U.S. Treasuries yields touched a 60-year trough.
 ""Europe is the No. 1 thing causing pressure on the market
as the realization grows that what we've done so far hasn't
worked,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, the New York-based chief
investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp, which has $1.65
trillion in client assets.
 Stark's departure highlighted divisions within the ECB on
the handling of Europe's debt woes. The ECB later confirmed
Stark will step down at the end of the year. [ID:nL5E7K91CF]
 ""When you get a new story like this, that there's internal
turmoil on the ECB, that immediately has implications for the
bond-buying program, which immediately has implications on the
capital level in European banks,"" said Jack de Gan, chief
investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire.
 Traders, surprised by the Stark news, were keeping tabs on
developments with Greece's debt swap. The deal is critical for
Athens to secure a second 109 billion euro bailout and avert a
near-term default that could ripple across Europe and the
global banking system.
 Banks and insurers face a Friday deadline to indicate
whether they will join an exchange of Greek debt, part of an
international bailout package agreed in July. It is expected 70
percent of the private investors would agree to such a move,
below the 90 percent threshold that Greece has said it wants to
go through with the deal. For more, see [ID:nLDE7880AH]
 The cost to insure Greek sovereign debt for five years
surged to a record high of 3,106 basis points, up nearly 300
basis points on the day, according to data vendor Markit.
 Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of
Seven industrialized nations were meeting in Marseille, where
host France has called for a coordinated response from G7
members to deal with Europe's debt crisis and the region's
shaky banks.

"
1320,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 09, 2011 03:40PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar strengthens in U.S. trade as euro dives,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved higher against its major counterparts in U.S. trade Friday, as the resignation of a key European Central Bank official renewed concerns over European debt and sent the euro tumbling to its lowest level since February.
In afternoon U.S. trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling sharply by 1.51% to hit 1.3672.
Earlier Friday, European Central Bank Governing Council member Juergen Stark, told ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet he would be leaving his post on the six-member Executive Board for “personal reasons.”
Last month, it was widely reported that Stark was opposed to the ECB’s resumption of its bond-buying program where it purchased large amounts of Spanish and Italian debt in an effort to curb the spread of debt contagion in the euro-zone.
Stark’s resignation reignited concerns over Europe’s ongoing debt crisis and plans for the European Financial Stability Facility, a rescue fund for debt threatened euro-zone members.
The greenback maintained momentum against its counterparts despite a sharp drop on Wall Street. In late afternoon trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.94% to 10,964.43, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.81% to 2,457.64, and the S&P 500 surrendered 2.97% to trade at 1,150.77.
Thursday evening’s speech by U.S. President Barack Obama where he proposed 
USD447 billion in economic stimulus, appeared to have a negligible effect on investors as the deal was likely to face stiff opposition in the Republican-held House of Representatives.
Meanwhile, the greenback was up against the British pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.49% to hit 1.5878. 
The dollar was higher against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY advancing 0.09% to hit 77.43, and USD/CHF higher by 0.87% to hit 0.8832. 
The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD up 0.72% to hit 0.9967, AUD/USD down 1.13% to hit 1.0455, and NZD/USD dropping 1.11% to hit 0.8213.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 1.15% at 77.23.
A meeting of G-7 finance officials in Marseille, France was scheduled to wrap up later Friday.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell to its lowest
in more than six months against the dollar on Friday as risk
aversion increased after news an ECB executive board member
will resign in protest over the bank's bond-buying program.
 Losses in the euro could accelerate in the coming weeks
given ongoing sovereign debt uncertainty and the European
Central Bank's shift to a neutral bias amid lower growth
forecasts. Money markets have consequently priced in a rate cut
from the ECB by year-end.
 News of ECB Executive Board Member Juergen Stark's
resignation over the bank's purchases of peripheral bonds
caught most investors by surprise. The ECB has been buying
government debt of highly-indebted euro countries such as
Italy, Spain, and Portugal to help shore up these nations'
finances. For more see [ID:nL5E7K91Q9] and [ID:nL5E7K91CF].
 ""The market has been euro-focused today because of all the
negative headlines and we have been bearish on the euro since
June,"" said Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical strategist at
CitiFX in New York.
 ""I wouldn't be surprised if the euro hits $1.35 over the
next week or two and $1.30 by the end of the year. It would be
a struggle to get back above $1.40.""
 The euro was also hurt by rumors Greece could default this
weekend, a speculation that was quashed by Greek finance
minister on Friday. See [ID:nL5E7K92JI].
 News in Europe overshadowed U.S. President Barack Obama's
proposed $447 billion jobs package on Thursday night, although
there was a brief trading flurry early in the Asian session
following his speech.
 Some investors though were skeptical that Obama's package
on jobs, made up largely of tax cuts for workers and
businesses, can sail smoothly through a divided Congress
[ID:nN1E78800M].
 The euro fell as low as $1.36268 on electronic trading
platform EBS , its lowest level since Feb. 22, and was
last down 1.5 percent for the day at $1.36820.
 The euro zone's common currency was on pace for its largest
weekly loss since early January.
 REDUCING EURO HOLDINGS
 One of the euro's early supporters among fund managers have
started to scale back their holdings of the currency such as
Palo Alto, California-based Merk Investments, with more than
$850 million in assets.
 Merk said it sold over $90 million worth of euros late on
Thursday to reallocate to the Australian dollar. The firm
though remained positive on the euro in the long term and
believed that euro zone concerns should primarily be played out
in the pricing of the bond market nit the currency.
 Against the yen, the euro fell to a low of 105.300 yen, the
lowest since at least mid 2004, the earliest EBS data available
at Reuters, before recovering to 105.419 yen, down 2 percent on
EBS .
 On Reuters data, the euro dropped to 105.27 yen, the lowest
since July 2001.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was down 0.7 percent at
1.20702 francs  on EBS, still above the 1.20 floor
set by the Swiss National Bank this week.
 ""This is all coming at exactly the wrong time,"" said Win
Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
""If we break $1.3659 -- that's a big retracement level of the
move this year -- then you're looking at $1.2867.""
 The focus now shifts to a meeting of G7 finance ministers
in France on Friday though few are expecting any groundbreaking
agreement on steps to ease fiscal problems in the euro zone.
 G7 officials are considering issuing a communique after
their talks, a G7 source said, and if they did it would talk
about the global economic slowdown, financial market turmoil
and the policy tools different countries could use, but it
would not make any reference to concerted intervention
[ID:nP6E7GQ01K].
 The ICE dollar index <.DXY> rose to six-month highs of
77.276, helped largely by the euro's fall. Against the yen, the
dollar edged up to a one-month high of 77.860 yen  on
EBS but was down 0.1 percent at 77.415 yen.

1323,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 09, 2011 12:52PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY falls in early U.S. trade,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved lower against the Japanese yen in U.S. trade Friday, 
as Wall Street shares slumped on euro-zone debt concerns and questions remained whether a proposed USD447 billion economic stimulus package would be approved by Congress. 
In early U.S. trade USD/JPY hit 77.10, the pair’s lowest since Tuesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 77.25, falling 0.33%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.71, Tuesday’s low, and resistance at 77.70, Wednesday’s high.
U.S. stocks retreated on news that European Central Bank Governing Council member Jeurgen Stark planned to step down from his post, reportedly over disagreement with ECB officials on the central bank’s resumption of its bond buying program.
Stark’s resignation reignited concerns over Europe’s ongoing debt crisis and plans for the European Financial Stability Facility, a rescue fund for debt threatened euro-zone members.
In mid-day U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply by 2.55% to 11,007.80, the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.12% to 2,475.43, and the S&P 500 retreated 2.46%. to 1,156.70.
On Thursday evening, U.S. President Barack Obama proposed a USD447 billion economic stimulus package that included tax cuts and other incentives the president insisted would provide a spark to the faltering U.S. economy.
Passage of the deal was expected to face a tough challenge in the U.S. House of Representatives where opposition Republicans hold the majority.
In Marseille, France, Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi said he would try to express to his fellow G-7 officials ongoing concerns that Tokyo has over a persistently strong yen.
The Bank of Japan has acted twice independently in the past year to weaken the yen against its counterparts, most recently on August 4. 
Meanwhile, the yen moved higher against the euro and the British pound with EUR/JPY down sharply by 1.86% to hit 105.57, and GBP/JPY slumping 0.82% to hit 122.62.
The meeting of G-7 finance ministers in Marseilles was scheduled to conclude later Friday.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Fears over Europe's festering
debt problems punished global stocks and the euro on Friday as
the stakes intensified for the world's top finance officials to
find ways to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control.
 The euro hit 6-1/2 month lows against the dollar, with more
declines likely after the European Central Bank shifted away
from further rises in interest rates, a key driver in the
single currency's rally this year.
 Nervousness over the outcome of a Greek debt swap deal
fueled safe-haven buying of German and U.S. government debt.
The 10-year Bund yield hit another record low, while yields on
benchmark U.S. Treasuries touched a 60-year trough.
 ""Europe is the No. 1 thing causing pressure on the market
as the realization grows that what we've done so far hasn't
worked,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, the New York-based chief
investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp, which has $1.65
trillion in client assets.
 Divisions within the ECB on the handling of Europe's debt
woes boiled over on Friday. Reuters reported board member
Juergen Stark will resign because of a conflict over its
controversial bond-buying program. The ECB later confirmed
Stark will step down at the end of the year. [ID:nL5E7K91CF]
 ""When you get a new story like this, that there's internal
turmoil on the ECB, that immediately has implications for the
bond-buying program, which immediately has implications on the
capital level in European banks,"" said Jack de Gan, chief
investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire.
 The debt swap deal is critical for Greece to secure a
second bailout and avert a near-term default that could ripple
across Europe and the global banking system.
 Banks and insurers face a Friday deadline to indicate
whether they will join an exchange of Greek debt, part of an
international bailout package agreed in July. It is expected 70
percent of these private investors would agree to such a move,
below the 90 percent threshold that Greece has said it wants to
go through with the deal. For more, see [ID:nLDE7880AH]
 The cost to insure Greek sovereign debt for five years
surged to a record high of 3,106 basis points, up nearly 300
basis points on the day, according to Markit.
 With that as a backdrop, finance ministers and central
bankers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations were to
meet in Marseille later on Friday.
 Meeting host France has called for a coordinated response
from G7 members to deal with Europe's debt crisis and the
region's shaky banks.

 In the United States, President Barack Obama unveiled his

worried that Congress would hold it up and the Federal Reserve

1325,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 09, 2011 12:13PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD sinks on ECB member resignation,"Investing.com - The euro fell to an eight-month low against the U.S. dollar in early trade Friday, following the resignation a of key European Central Bank official and renewed fears over a worsening of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.
EUR/USD hit 1.3698 in early U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since February 23; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3659, falling 1.59%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3526, the low of February 22, and resistance at 1.4150, Wednesday’s high .
Earlier Friday, European Central Bank Governing Council member Juergen Stark, told ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet he would be leaving his post on the six-member Executive Board for “personal reasons.”
Last month, it was widely reported that Stark was opposed to the ECB’s resumption of its bond-buying program where it purchased large amounts of Spanish and Italian debt in an effort to curb the spread of debt contagion in the euro-zone.
Trichet admitted in August that the central bank had not voted unanimously to resume bond purchases but that an “overwhelming majority” of the 23-member Governing Council had approved the move.
European markets dropped sharply on the news; in late trade France’s CAC was down 2.84% to 2,997.92, Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 1.68% to 5,250.45 and Germany’s DAX was sharply lower by 3.25% to 5,232.69.
Wall Street was equally unnerved by Stark’s resignation and the wider implications for Europe’s debt woes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.21% to 11,047.24, the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.54% to 2,489.35, and the S&P 500 surrendered 2.03%. to 1,162.11.
Investors remained skeptical that U.S. President Barack Obama’s USD447 billion economic stimulus proposal, announced Thursday evening, would be able to secure passage in Congress.
Meanwhile, the euro was lower against both the British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP down by 1.1% to hit 0.8602, and EUR/JPY falling 1.83% to hit 105.65.
A meeting of G-7 finance ministers in Marseilles, France was scheduled to conclude later Friday.

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell to six-month lows
versus the dollar and the yen on Friday, with more falls likely
after the European Central Bank dropped its tightening bias and
forecast lower growth in the debt-plagued euro zone.	
 The euro's fall helped drive the dollar index to
two-month highs , while the greenback also hit
three-and-a-half-month highs versus the Swiss franc and a
one-month high against the yen . 
The European Central Bank held rates steady at its policy
meeting on Thursday, saying inflation risks are no longer skewed
to the upside and that economic growth in the region will be
slow at best, prompting money markets to fully price in a rate
cut by the year-end. 
 ""The ECB has now left the door open for an easing of policy
and there are more downside risks to come for the euro with
Greek PSI (private sector involvement in the bailout) to be
finalised and ratification of the EFSF (rescue fund) still
required,"" said Kiran Kowshik, currency strategist at BNP
Paribas.	
 The euro fell to $1.3788 on trading platform EBS after
breaking below its July low of $1.3838 to trade at its lowest
levels since mid-March and was last down 0.6 percent for the
day.	
 ""Interest rate differentials have been the dominant
influence on euro/dollar t	
 his year so the change in the ECB's stance suggests the euro
should go lower,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank. 
 Technical analysts said the break below the euro's 200-day
moving average earlier in the week at $1.4024 was a bearish
sign. A daily close underneath the July low of $1.3838 would add
to the heavy outlook, with next support at $1.3770, the 38.2
percent retracement of the euro's 2010 to 2011 rally. 
 The common currency fell to a six-month low of 107.17 yen,
slipping below Thursday's base of 107.56. Against the Swiss
franc, it was steady around 1.2148 francs , still
above the 1.20 floor set by the Swiss National Bank.	
 ""The SNB measures mean safe-haven flows are being redirected
elsewhere. It's a battle of the uglies with euro/dollar but when
the euro zone crisis worsens the dollar will see additional
safe-haven flows, at least in the near term,"" said Foley at
Rabobank.	
 The dollar rose to a three-and-a-half month high versus the
Swiss franc of 0.8815 francs as the SNB's measures kept
investors wary.	
 
G7 EXPECTATIONS LOW 
Another potential pitfall for the euro is uncertainty over
Greece's debt swap plan. Friday is the deadline Athens has given
investors in Greek bonds to say whether they intend to take part
in its debt exchange offer, a key part of a second 109 billion
euro bailout package it clinched on July 21 to avoid bankruptcy.

Because of the time needed to process all responses, however,
Athens has no plan to announce the result on Friday, while a low
participation rate in Greece's debt swap could mean reluctant
euro zone partners will have to cough up more cash for the
overall package to work.	
 The market showed little reaction to U.S. President Barack
Obama's $447 billion package on jobs, made up largely of tax
cuts for workers and businesses, due to doubts over whether he
can push it through a divided Congress. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered little new
insight as to what the central bank will do at its policy
meeting on Sept. 20-21 in his speech on Thursday, though most
players remain convinced that the bank will start buying
longer-dated bonds in a bid to try to lower longer bond yields. 
The dollar index rose to 2-month highs of 76.684,
helped largely by the euro's fall. Against the yen, the dollar
edged up to a one-month high of 77.84 yen .	
 Finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 economic
powers meet in Marseille on Friday with global slowdown and debt
crises pressuring them to find new solutions, and currency
intervention back on the table, but expectations for action are
low.	
 Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called for the G7's
understanding on Japan's intentions to counter speculative moves
in the yen, after Switzerland's aggressive move this week in
setting a floor for euro/Swiss to try and protect its export
driven economy.	
 Traders said they would watch for any comments about the
stance of officials on intervention and global imbalances. Some
said reassurance about the global economic outlook could spur
demand for riskier assets, which may be positive for the euro.

 LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Friday on
investor worries that a U.S. plan to stimulate jobs and growth
will be held up in Congress and may not be followed fast enough
by action from the Federal Reserve. 
 The euro hit six-month lows against the dollar and the yen
with more falls likely after the European Central Bank shifted
away from further rises in interest rates, a key driver in the
single currency's rally this year. 
 U.S. shares were poised for a weaker open, extending
Thursday's falls after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
left the door open for new stimulus measures but stopped short
of signalling the central bank would take the plunge.	
 Markets are concerned that President Barack Obama's proposed
$447 billion package of tax cuts and spending plans aimed at
boosting growth and job creation could be hamstrung by political
wrangling.	
 ""Investors are holding back...There isn't any reason to
commit until you can see credible policies,"" Justin Urquhart
Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management, said.	
 ""Bernanke was never going to say anything. He made it clear
at Jackson Hole he was pushing it back to the politicians.
Obama has come up with this stimulus package. We now have to
digest what effect this will have, assuming it is passed."" 
 European shares fell as much as 1.1 percent,
pulling down the MSCI world equity index 0.7
percent. S&P index futures  were last down 0.6 percent,
pointing to a lower start on Wall Street.	
 Market confidence has been fragile this week due to growing
concerns over the global economy and Europe's debt crisis, with
Friday's deadline for bond holders to decide on Greece's swap
offer adding to the nervousness. 
 
 G7 EXPECTATIONS 
 G7 finance ministers and central bankers meet later on
Friday and the faltering global recovery and Europe's problems
are the main issues of the day. 
 
 Host France has called for co-ordinated action to boost
growth, but the divergent economic problems facing the United
States, Britain and the euro zone are complicating the task.	
 One G7 source told Reuters a unanimous agreement in
Marseille on coordinated monetary easing was unlikely but there
has been some speculation on markets the meeting would generate
more than just words.	
 ""There is some expectation doing the rounds that the G-7
meeting will produce a key coordinated policy response. We have
our doubts,"" Lloyds strategists said in a note. 
 ""In this environment, while acknowledging scope for bouts of
near-term risk-asset buoyancy, we continue to anticipate money
flowing into higher-grade fixed-income product into yield back-
ups.""	
 The retreat in equities boosted safe-haven German government
bond prices, with Bund futures  jumping one full point
to a record high of 137.45.	
 The euro was last down 0.4 percent against the dollar
at $1.3832, its lowest in nearly six months with traders saying
selling in the single currency accelerated when stop-loss orders
were triggered below $1.3840.	
 Analysts saw more downside as sentiment stays negative after
the ECB dropped its tightening bias and investors believe a
lasting solution to the euro zone crisis remains elusive. 
 ""The ECB has now left the door open for an easing of policy
and there are more downside risks to come for the euro with
Greek PSI (private sector involvement) to be finalised and
ratification of the EFSF (rescue fund) still required."" said
Kiran Kowshik, currency strategist at BNP Paribas.	
 The euro's retreat helped drive the dollar to two-month
highs against a basket of currencies . The greenback also
hit three-and-a-half month peaks versus the Swiss franc
and a one-month high against the yen .	
 Gold, propelled to a series of records in recent months due
to its appeal as both a safe haven and hedge against inflation,
reversed earlier gains. Itwas last down 1.7 percent at $1,837 an
ounce as nervous investors sold the metal on growing concerns
its run-up to record highs had been overdone. 
Oil also fell as the dollar's climb made it more expensive
for holders of other currencies, with U.S. crude futures 
trading 1.5 percent down at $87.70 a barrel and Brent crude
 0.4 percent lower at $114.09.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise	
 LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Friday,
keeping safe-haven government debt well-bid after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave no steer on new stimulus
measures and as a $447 billion U.S. jobs package failed to lure
investors back into equities.	
 The euro also fell to a two-month low after the region's
festering debt crisis forced the European Central Bank to change
course away from further rises in interest rates, a key driver
in the single currency's rally this year. 
 European stocks snapped a two-day recovery spurred by
speculation that Bernanke would signal new stimulus plans to
support the economy. His speech kept the door open for the Fed
to do so but stopped short of signalling it would take the
plunge.	
 Equity markets were also concerned that President Barack
Obama's proposed $447 billion package of tax cuts and spending
plans aimed at boosting growth and job creation could be
hamstrung by political wrangling when it goes to Congress.	
 ""Investors are holding back...There isn't any reason to
commit until you can see credible policies,"" Justin Urquhart
Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management, said.	
""Bernanke was never going to say anything. He made it clear
at Jackson Hole he was pushing it back to the politicians.
Obama has come up with this stimulus package. We now have to
digest what effect this will have, assuming it is passed."" 
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.4
percent, with the pan-European share index slipping 0.1
percent in early trade.	
 S&P futures  were down 0.3 percent, indicating a lower
open on Wall Street later in the session.	
 Market confidence has been fragile this week due to growing
concerns over the global economy and Europe's debt crisis, with
a looming deadline for bond holders to decide on Greece's swap
offer adding to the nervousness. 
 G7 finance chiefs meet later on Friday, with the faltering
global recovery and Europe's problems likely to be the issues of
the day. 
 The fragile tone in riskier assets kept safe-haven German
government bonds well-bid, with Bund futures  up 40
ticks at 136.85 and benchmark U.S. T-note yields hovering within
striking distance of 1.908 percent , its lowest in 60
years hit on Tuesday. 
 The euro was a touch down against the dollar on the
day at $1.3876 and analysts saw more downside as sentiment stays
negative after the ECB dropped its tightening bias and investors
believe a lasting solution to euro zone debt crisis remains
elusive. 
 ""The ECB has now left the door open for an easing of policy
and there are more downside risks to come for the euro with
Greek PSI (private sector involvement) to be finalised and
ratification of the EFSF still required."" said Kiran Kowshik,
currency strategist at BNP Paribas.

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The euro was off a two-month low
against the dollar on Friday but the risk of a break below its
July trough is seen rising after a deepening debt crisis forced
the European Central Bank to drop its tightening policy bias, a
key driver in the euro's rally earlier this year.	
 The market showed a mostly muted response to U.S. President
Barack Obama's $447 billion package on jobs that is made up
largely of tax cuts for workers and businesses, amid doubts over
whether he can push it through a divided Congress.	
 ""The euro now doesn't have the support of expectations for
rising interest rates, which clearly points to the higher
possibility that the euro will fall below (its July low near)
$1.38. In addition, strains on European banks' funding are
rising. Given all this, the euro looks likely to fall further,""
said Minori Uchida, senior analyst at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.	
 In Asian trade, sizable buying in the euro against the yen,
thought to be from Japanese investors, lifted the euro slightly
against the dollar and the yen.	
 The euro traded at $1.3890 , after dropping to $1.3873
on Thursday, its lowest in two months. A close below $1.3900, a
50 percent retracement of the currency's rally from January to
May, could raise the case for more weakness.	
 Traders expect the currency to head towards the
July low of $1.38376, a break of which could send a strongly
bearish signal, with $1.35 cited as its next possible target.	
""The euro is unequivocally bearish. It broke through its
long-term support and is likely to go significantly lower,"" said
David Scutt, a trader at Arab Bank Australia. 
The European Central Bank held rates steady at its policy
meeting on Thursday, saying inflation risks are no longer skewed
to the upside and that economic growth in the region will be
slow at best, prompting money markets to fully price in a rate
cut by the year-end. 
 Dollar funding strains for European banks showed no sign of
abating with the euro/dollar basis swap spread on Thursday
hitting its highest since last 2008.	
 The common currency stood at 107.65 yen , near its
six-month low of 107.54 yen hit on Thursday. Against the Swiss
franc, it eased to slightly to 1.2130 franc , still
above the 1.20 floor set by the Swiss National Bank.	
 
 POTENTIAL PITFALL	
 Another potential pitfall for the euro is uncertainty over
Greece's debt swap plan as Friday is the deadline Athens has
given investors in Greek bonds to say whether they intend to
take part in its debt exchange offer, a key part of a second 109
billion euro bailout package it clinched on July 21 to avoid
bankruptcy. 
 Because of the time needed to process all responses,
however, Athens has no plan to announce the result on Friday.	
 Greece had threatened to cancel the deal unless it got 90
percent participation, a stance some banks think may just be
tactics by Athens to get most bondholders on board. 
 Still, a low participation rate in Greece's debt swap could
mean reluctant euro zone partners will have to cough up more
cash for the overall package to work.	
 But the dollar also lacked traction after Obama's
long-awaited job proposals failed to boost hopes of a U.S.
recovery. U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week,
highlighting the fragile state of the U.S. job market.	
 ""To some extent, this was largely in line with the chatter
we heard before it's release. It may even be a bit smaller than
needed given the gravity of the problem. That could prevent
markets from reacting too positively,"" said Omer Esiner, senior
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. 
 ""And at the end of the day, it depends on what the finished
product will be. A lot of this will be chopped up before it is
passed. We've seen a lot of political paralysis in Washington.""	
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered little new
insight as to what the central bank will do at its policy
meeting on Sept. 20-21 in his speech on Thursday, though most
players remain convinced that the bank will start buying
longer-dated bonds in a bid to try to lower longer bond yields.	
 The dollar index stood at 76.23, having surged to
two-month highs of 76.319 on Thursday. Against the yen, the
dollar stood flat at 77.48 yen . 
 The Australian dollar gained 0.2 percent to $1.0600
, but lacked the energy to tackle a resistance-packed
zone from $1.0630, its 55-day moving average, through $1.0648,
the 100-day average, to $1.0657, a 61.8 percent retracement of
its decline earlier this month.

In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.40% to hit 1.3937.
Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly for the week ending September 2.
Jobless claims rose by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 414,000, above market forecasts of a decline to 405,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 412,000 from 409,000.
Later in the day, Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank would be discussing options available to support the economy, but fell short of spelling out specific proposals for growth. 
Analysts had been looking at the Fed’s outlook on inflation as key to whether the U.S. central bank would be introducing a new round of quantitative easing.
The jobless numbers along with the lack of direction on economic stimulus from the Fed sent Wall Street shares lower for the fourth time in five sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.04%, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.78%, and the S&P 500 declined 1.06%.
Thursday evening, U.S. President Barack Obama spoke before a joint session of Congress where he outlined a USD447 billion proposal to stimulate the U.S. economy.
Meanwhile, the greenback was lower against the British pound, with GBP/USD up by 0.18% to hit 1.5987. 
The dollar was down against both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY dropping 0.02% to hit 77.49, and USD/CHF down by 0.42% to hit 0.8718. 
The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD down 0.21% to hit 0.9871, AUD/USD up by 0.49% to hit 1.0627, and NZD/USD gaining 0.63% to hit 0.8360.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.25% at 76.16.

 "
1348,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2011 10:37PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY falls in mid-day Asian trade,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved lower against the Japanese yen in Asian trade Friday, as data revealing a contraction in Japan’s gross domestic product was offset by a lack of commitment from the U.S. Federal Reserve to institute further economic stimulus.
In mid-day Asian trade USD/JPY hit 77.43 the pair’s lowest since Tuesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 77.38, falling 0.02%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.71, Tuesday’s low, and resistance at 77.70, Wednesday’s high.
Earlier Friday, Japan’s Cabinet Office released showing the country’s gross domestic product shrank by 0.5% in the April to June quarter, following a 0.3% contraction in the previous quarter.
The 0.5% decrease in Japanese GDP was in line with market expectations.
The Cabinet Office release showed that GDP for the quarter was down 2.1% from a year ago, revised from the initial 1.3% projected drop.
Separately, Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi said he would try to express to his fellow G-7 officials ongoing concerns that Tokyo has on a persistently strong yen.
Speaking from a meeting of G-7 policy makers in Marseille, France, Azumi said, “I want to tell them that we are going to take bold action if there are excessive moves.”
“Japan is closely monitoring speculative trading and a strong yen threatens to throw water on the economic recovery,” Azumi added.
The Bank of Japan has acted twice independently in the past year to weaken the yen against its counterparts, most recently on August 4. Azumi’s comments were seen as a sign that further unilateral intervention by the BOJ in currency markets may not be positively viewed by fellow G-7 finance ministers.
Earlier Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank would be discussing options available to support the economy, but fell short of spelling out specific proposals for growth. 
Analysts had been looking at the Fed’s outlook on inflation as key to whether the U.S. central bank would be introducing a new round of quantitative easing.
Following Bernanke’s comments, Wall Street shares sagged to end the session lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.04%, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.78%, and the S&P 500 declined 1.06%.
Meanwhile, the yen moved lower against both the euro and the British pound with EUR/JPY up 0.34% to hit 107.94, and GBP/JPY adding 0.12% to hit 123.84.
The U.S. Census Bureau was scheduled to release wholesale inventory figures, an indication of consumer demand, later Friday.

 By Saikat Chatterjee and Alex Richardson	
 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Sept 9 (Reuters) - European stock
index futures fell on Friday, following Asian markets lower, as
a $447 billion jobs package from U.S. President Barack Obama
failed to entice investors back into equities amid concerns that
it could be hamstrung by political wrangling.	
 The euro languished near a two-month low reached on Thursday
after the region's deepening debt crisis forced the European
Central Bank to drop its tightening policy bias, a key driver in
the single currency's rally this year.	
 Euro STOXX 50  index futures fell 1.1 percent, with
DAX and CAC-40 futures also in the red, and spreadbetters called
the FTSE 100 to open down 0.3 percent.	
 Asian markets were down around half a percent, after
see-sawing between gains and losses, while S&P 500 futures
 surrendered early gains and slipped 0.2 percent.

 ""Obama's plan was in line with expectations, and U.S. stocks
are unlikely to rally on it,"" said Takashi Ushio, head of
investment strategy at Marusan Securities Co. in Tokyo.
""Uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy remains.""	
 Market confidence had been fragile after Western central
banks failed to offer any clues on fresh stimulus plans this
week, with a looming deadline for bond holders to decide on
Greece's swap offer also adding to the nervousness.

 Investors are also eyeing a meeting of G7 finance chiefs
later on Friday, with the faltering global economic recovery and
feastering euro zone debt crisis likely to be the issues of the
day.

 
 CHINA INFLATION EASES	
 There was, however, better news from China, where consumer
inflation appears to have peaked, with August numbers coming in
slightly below July's three-year high, underscoring expectations
that the central bank will hold off on further policy tightening
as the global economy slows. 
 ""Consumer inflation has obviously peaked. Inflation is no
longer a big problem now,"" said Dong Xian'an, an economist at
Peking First Advisory in Beijing. ""On the policy front,
tightening steps are at least on hold now.	
 U.S. Treasuries slipped as markets reacted cautiously to the
job creation plan from Obama, who faces a fierce battle to win
over Republican opponents in a divided Congress which could
revive the spectre of political paralysis in Washington.	
 Global markets have been dominated in recent weeks by fears
of a U.S. relapse into recession and Europe's snowballing debt
crisis. Citigroup analyst Jonathan Stubbs said in a note on
Friday that ""recession appears to be a more likely outcome now
in Europe and/or the U.S. than 3-6 months ago"".	
 Worries about the darkening outlook for the developed world
prompted Asian central banks including South Korea and Indonesia
to hold interest rates steady on Thursday, following similar
moves by Australia, Canada, Japan and Sweden this week.	
 Japan's Nikkei fell 0.6 percent and the MSCI's
broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 0.7 percent, on course for a weekly loss
after two weeks in positive territory. 
 Some regional markets bucked the trend, though, with
Australia and Taiwan , both heavily influenced by
demand from China, posting gains. 
 The ex-Japan index is down more than 16 percent from its
2011 high in April, after fears about the U.S. economy and
Europe sparked a global market rout last month.	
 
 POLICY STIMULUS	
 The European Central Bank on Thursday discussed downside
risks to the euro zone's economy, while U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech that authorities would do
all they can to boost growth and employment. 
 But both steered clear of announcing any fresh steps,
disappointing some investors.	
 Wall Street's main indexes closed down around 1 percent,
with banks the biggest decliners, after Bernanke gave no
indications of new stimulus measures to support the flagging
economy.	
 After the Wall Street close, Obama announced the package of
tax cuts and government spending that will be critical to his
re-election chances. 
 ""At the end of the day, it depends on what the finished
product will be,"" said Omer Esiner, senior market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.	
 ""A lot of this will be chopped up before it is passed. We've
seen a lot of political paralysis in Washington.""	
 The euro traded around $1.3895, not far above a
two-month low of $1.3873 plumbed on Thursday.	
 Gold, propelled to a series of records in recent months due
to its appeal as both a safe haven and hedge against inflation,
was little changed at about $1,870 an ounce, after jumping 3
percent in the previous session. 
 Oil, which had dipped on Thursday as the dollar rose making
it more expensive for holders of other currencies, was also
flat, with U.S. crude futures  trading around $89 a barrel
and Brent crude  at $114.68. 
 ""The question for the oil market is on demand destruction
and how confident the consumer is, both of which are very
uncertain,"" said Jeremy Friesen, commodity strategist at Societe
Generale in Hong Kong.	
 ""If European and U.S. policymakers can find some compromise
and willingness to work together before economics force their
hand, then that is bullish for oil. But I think we will probably
see the market grind sideways.""

EUR/USD hit 1.3916 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Wednesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3908 rising 0.22%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3838, the low of July 12, and resistance at 1.4248, Wednesday’s high.
Earlier Thursday, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters in Frankfurt that “looking ahead, we expect the euro area to grow moderately, subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks.”
Trichet’s remarks were a possible indication that the ECB would not likely be introducing any additional interest rate hikes after two raises in April and July that set the lending rate at 1.5%.
Some economists had forecast an impending rate cut from the European Central Bank in light of tepid growth of only 0.2% in euro-zone GDP for the second quartler.
European stocks finished Thursday’s session higher, with France’s CAC 40 rising 0.41% to 3,085.83, Britain’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.41% to 5,340.38, and Germany’s DAX rose fractionally by 0.05% to end the day at 5,408.46.
On the other side of the Atlantic, Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank would be discussing options available to support the economy, but fell short of spelling out specific proposals for growth.  
“Importantly, we see little indication that the higher rate of inflation experienced so far this year has become ingrained in the economy,” Bernanke said to an economic group in Minneapolis.
Analysts had been looking at the Fed’ outlook on inflation as key to whether the U.S. central bank would be introducing a new round of quantitative easing.
Following Bernanke’s comments, Wall Street shares sagged to end the session lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.04% to 11,295.81, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.78% to 2,529.14 and the S&P 500 declined 1.06% to close the day at 1,185.90.
Meanwhile, the euro was higher against the both British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP up by 0.07% to hit 0.8703, and EUR/JPY rising 0.20% to hit 107.79.
Market eyes turned attention to Thursday evening’s scheduled speech by U.S. President Barack Obama, where he was expected to propose a nearly USD300 package to boost the country’s economy.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a two-month
low against the dollar on Thursday after the European Central
Bank signaled a pause in its interest-rate tightening cycle
that began just five months ago.
 The euro area economy is subject to ""intensified downside
risks,"" ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said in a press
conference after the ECB left rates at 1.5 percent, marking a
significant change in stance from last month when the bank was
focused on inflation risks. For details, see [ID:nL5E7K80SP]
 Trichet's comments had pushed the euro down more than 1
percent against the dollar. Losses deepened after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered no details of potential
easing measures to boost a flagging U.S. economy, which
encouraged some dollar bulls. See [ID:nW1E7IR02M]
 ""We haven't heard anything that moves the debate about (a
third round of quantitative easing) forward. So in that
respect, there's perhaps a diminished chance that we will see
any Fed action at this month's policy meeting,"" said Omer
Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange
in Washington.
 The euro fell as low as $1.38750  on trading
platform EBS, its lowest since July 12, with losses
accelerating after breaching support near $1.3900 -- the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of its low to high this year.
 It last traded at $1.3885, down 1.5 percent on the day. The
euro also lost 1.4 percent against the British pound to 86.97
pence .
 Trichet ""is definitely signaling neutrality, but in that
couching language of maybe accommodative monetary policy, if
GDP turns negative,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
currency research at GFT in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""There is
no more tightening in the foreseeable future as the economic
data has definitely deteriorated.""
 Money markets are pricing in a chance of a rate cut by the
ECB as early as October as the European debt crisis shows no
sign of relenting and the global economic outlook deteriorates.

 EURO DOWNSIDE
 A close below its 200-day moving average, currently around
$1.4023, should signal further declines in the euro/dollar,
traders said. The pair broke and closed below this level on
Tuesday. The next key downside target lies at $1.38376 on EBS,
the euro's low set on July 12.
 Greece on Thursday reported its economy shrank 7.3 percent
in the second quarter from a year ago, highlighting the
difficulties indebted countries face in trying to reduce their
deficits. [ID:nL5E7K80RJ]
 The bickering and policy disagreements among the 17 member
countries in the euro zone has even given rise to concerns
among some investors the bloc may eventually break up, traders
say. Greece on Thursday ruled out quitting the euro.
 Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5966 , after
earlier rising above $1.60 after the Bank of England kept
interest rates at 0.5 percent and made no changes to its

 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 77.46
. Selling by Japanese exporters was seen capping the
pair around 77.50 yen.
 The dollar rallied 2 percent to 0.8749 Swiss franc, after
hitting a 3-1/2-month high of 0.87704 franc  on EBS.
 The franc has been under pressure after the Swiss National
Bank on Tuesday imposed a floor on euro/Swiss franc at 1.2000.
The euro rose 0.4 percent to 1.2145 francs .

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on
Thursday on disappointment that a speech by the Federal Reserve
chief lacked details on plans to spur economic growth, while
the euro declined on fears the euro zone debt crisis is
worsening with Greece failing to meet fiscal targets.
 Safe havens were still in favor with investors, as gold
prices rebounded after a two-day fall and German and U.S.
government bond yields edged closer to their historic lows.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank ""will
do all it can"" to boost economic growth and reduce
unemployment, but he did not disclose what monetary tools the
Fed might use. For details, see [ID:nW1E7IR02M]
 ""The markets are going to be disappointed in this and
concerned that the Fed is only acknowledging the problems

market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Traders shifted their focus to U.S. President Barack
Obama's televised speech to Congress at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT).
He is expected to announce a $300 billion plan that includes
tax cuts for middle-class families and businesses and new
spending to repair roads, bridges and other
infrastructure.[nN1E786157]

Access in New York.
 Later this week, G7 finance ministers and central bankers
will convene in Marseilles, France, with markets expecting them
to pledge support to help a struggling global economy.

 A U.S. government report showing an increase in weekly
jobless claims and remarks by European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet about downside risks to the euro zone's
economy fueled fears that both the United States and Europe are
at risk of slipping into recession.
 Those worries briefly pushed equities markets into negative
territory before some buying emerged before Bernanke's speech.
 After a choppy trading session, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> ended down 119.05 points, or 1.04 percent, at
11,295.81. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> finished down

Composite Index <.IXIC> closed down 19.80 points, or 0.78
percent, at 2,529.14.
 Losses on Wall Street knocked MSCI's world stock index
<.MIWD00000PUS> down 0.6 percent on the day. The MSCI index has
recovered a tad from its August correction -- the worst monthly
loss since 2008 -- but is still 16 percent below the 2011 highs
hit in May.
 Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> finished up 0.3 percent,
while the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European
shares ended up 0.9 percent after erasing early gains on the
ECB's decision to leave key rates steady.
 In the wake of Trichet's cautious economic outlook and the

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on
Thursday on disappointment that a speech by the Federal Reserve
chief lacked details on plans to spur economic growth, while
the euro slipped on fears the euro zone debt crisis is
worsening with Greece failing to meet fiscal targets.
 Safe havens were still in favor with investors, with gold
prices rising after a two-day fall and German and U.S.
government bond yields edging closer to their historic lows.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank ""will
do all it can"" to boost economic growth and reduce
unemployment, but he did not disclose what monetary tools the
Fed might use. For more, see [ID:nW1E7IR02M]
 ""The markets are going to be disappointed in this and
concerned that the Fed is only acknowledging the problems
without offering any real solutions,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Traders have shifted their focus to U.S. President Barack
Obama's televised speech to Congress at 7 p.m. (2300 GMT), in
which he is expected to propose tax cuts for middle-class
households and businesses and new spending to repair roads,
bridges and other infrastructure. [nN1E786157]
 ""Everyone's waiting for the President to give a real, good,
solid speech tonight. He's got to deliver something strong and
positive,"" said Michael Cullen, head bond trader at Wall Street
Access in New York.
 Later this week, G7 finance ministers and central bankers
will convene in Marseilles, France, with markets expecting them

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a two-month
low against the dollar on Thursday after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet highlighted downside risks to the
euro zone economy, signaling no rate increases in the near
term.
 For his comments, click on [ID:nFAT007243].
 Investors had already struck a cautious tone on the euro
after European Central Bank policymakers had left the benchmark
interest rate at 1.5 percent as expected.
 Though the bank was seen as likely to change tack from its
prior hawkish tone and flag a pause in the recent monetary
tightening cycle, the news still prompted swift investor
reaction.
 A month ago the bank had considered the risks to growth
were balanced, Trichet said in a press conference following the
rate decision, but that is not the case today.
[ID:nFAT007245].
 Trichet ""is definitely signaling neutrality but in that
couching language of maybe accommodative monetary policy, if
GDP turns negative,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
currency research at GFT in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""There is
no more tightening in the foreseeable future as the economic
data has definitely deteriorated.""
 The euro dropped 0.6 percent at $1.4008  on
electronic trading platform EBS, with the session low of
$1.3943 the lowest since July 12.
 Money markets are pricing in a chance of a rate cut as
early as October as the debt crisis shows no sign of relenting
and the global economic outlook deteriorates.

 One analyst expected more from the central bank on dealing
with the euro zone peripheral debt crisis. [ID:nF9E7IB01Y].
 ""Downplaying the situation in the euro zone periphery
suggests they are slightly detached from the reality which does
not instill much confidence that they have an understanding of
the gravity of the situation,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Data from Greece showed the economy shrank 7.3 percent in
the second quarter from a year ago, highlighting the
difficulties indebted countries face in trying to reduce their
deficits. [ID:nL5E7K80RJ]
 The bickering and policy disagreements among the 17 member
countries in the euro zone on policies has even given rise to
concerns among some investors that the bloc may eventually
break up, traders say.
 DOLLAR ALSO SEEN VULNERABLE; BOE HOLDS
 Sterling turned higher, rising back above $1.60 against the
dollar  after the Bank of England kept interest rates
at 0.5 percent and made no changes to its asset-purchasing
programme. [ID:nAHL8KE72R] The pound was last up 0.4 percent
at $1.6044.
 While expected, traders said the pound gained on
short-covering by some market players who had priced in the
chance that the central bank may initiate more economic
stimulus.
 Meanwhile, any enthusiasm for more bearish bets on the euro
may be countered by expectations that U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking at 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT),
might drop clearer hints on the likelihood of more stimulus
later this month. Any hint of more easing could hurt the
dollar.
 Markets, however, also are speculating that instead the Fed
could opt for the so-called 'Operation Twist', in which it
sells short maturities and uses the proceeds to buy long-term
debt, thus flattening the yield curve but keeping balance
sheets unchanged.
 The greenback was little changed at 77.264 yen  on
EBS. Selling by Japanese exporters was seen capping the pair
below 77.50 yen, though wariness about official intervention
limited weakness in the dollar.
 The dollar was up 1.1 percent against the Swiss franc ay
0.8668 francs, after earlier hitting a 3-1/2 month high of
0.86920 francs  on trading platform EBS.
 The Swiss franc has been broadly under pressure since
Tuesday when the Swiss National Bank imposed a floor on the
euro/Swiss franc pair at 1.2000 francs. The euro was last at
1.2142 francs  on EBS, up 0.4 percent.

currency research at GFT in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""There is
no more tightening in the foreseeable future as the economic
data has definitely deteriorated.""
 The euro dropped 0.6 percent at $1.4008  on
electronic trading platform EBS, with the session low of
$1.3943 the lowest since July 12.
 Money markets are pricing in a chance of a rate cut as
early as October as the debt crisis shows no sign of relenting
and the global economic outlook deteriorates.

 One analyst expected more from the central bank on dealing
with the euro zone peripheral debt crisis. [ID:nF9E7IB01Y].
 ""Downplaying the situation in the euro zone periphery
suggests they are slightly detached from the reality which does
not instill much confidence that they have an understanding of
the gravity of the situation,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Data from Greece showed the economy shrank 7.3 percent in
the second quarter from a year ago, highlighting the
difficulties indebted countries face in trying to reduce their
deficits. [ID:nL5E7K80RJ]
 The bickering and policy disagreements among the 17 member
countries in the euro zone on policies has even given rise to
concerns among some investors that the bloc may eventually
break up, traders say.
 DOLLAR ALSO SEEN VULNERABLE; BOE HOLDS
 Sterling turned higher, rising back above $1.60 against the
dollar  after the Bank of England kept interest rates
at 0.5 percent and made no changes to its asset-purchasing
programme. [ID:nAHL8KE72R] The pound was last up 0.4 percent
at $1.6044.
 While expected, traders said the pound gained on
short-covering by some market players who had priced in the
chance that the central bank may initiate more economic
stimulus.
 Meanwhile, any enthusiasm for more bearish bets on the euro
may be countered by expectations that U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking at 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT),
might drop clearer hints on the likelihood of more stimulus
later this month. Any hint of more easing could hurt the
dollar.
 Markets, however, also are speculating that instead the Fed
could opt for the so-called 'Operation Twist', in which it
sells short maturities and uses the proceeds to buy long-term
debt, thus flattening the yield curve but keeping balance
sheets unchanged.
 The greenback was little changed at 77.264 yen  on
EBS. Selling by Japanese exporters was seen capping the pair
below 77.50 yen, though wariness about official intervention
limited weakness in the dollar.
 The dollar was up 1.1 percent against the Swiss franc ay
0.8668 francs, after earlier hitting a 3-1/2 month high of
0.86920 francs  on trading platform EBS.
 The Swiss franc has been broadly under pressure since
Tuesday when the Swiss National Bank imposed a floor on the
euro/Swiss franc pair at 1.2000 francs. The euro was last at
1.2142 francs  on EBS, up 0.4 percent.

 LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell further versus the
dollar on Thursday after the European Central Bank kept interest
rates on hold and traders bet that a monetary tightening cycle
that kicked off five months ago has given way to a new phase of
steady or even lower rates.	
 In London, the Bank of England also kept rates at a record
low 0.5 percent for the 30th month in a row but held off
increasing its asset buying programme. That allowed the British
pound to rise off eight-week lows hit earlier against the
dollar.	
 European stocks gave up some gains after the ECB
announcement while U.S. equity markets were poised to open flat
after the previous session's 2.8 percent gains.	
 Markets had already firmly priced in an end to the ECB's
rate hike cycle and the single currency could in fact get a lift
if ECB boss Jean-Claude Trichet -- due to speak to media at 1230
GMT -- quashes speculation of rate cuts to support economies
battered by the debt crisis.	
 By 1150 GMT, the single currency fell to a session low of
$1.4030 . German government bonds rose after the
announcement with December Bund futures hitting a
session high of 136.87 and benchmark 10-year yields
easing a touch to 1.86 percent. 
 
 Traders are also keen to hear Trichet's views on the bank's
buying of southern European and Irish bonds given that the ECB
has been internally divided over the programme.	
 ""The most likely scenario is that it (ECB) signals that
rates will be on hold for some quarters and that the SMP (bond
buy) programme will continue and will include Italian and
Spanish bonds,"" said Intesa Sanpaolo economist Paolo Mameli. 
""Considering the current level of tensions in markets at
present the ECB probably wants to leave itself complete freedom
to do whatever it needs to do in the future."" 
 The pound jumped to a session high of $1.6015 after the BOE
announcement while the euro scraped a session low of
87.74 pence. 
 Some investors had priced in the chance the BOE would
initiate additional quantitative easing (QE) in the form of more
asset purchases. Most analysts see this as likely in coming
months, meaning the pound will see little respite. 
 ""We expect to see more QE by November at the latest. Against
a deteriorating domestic and international backdrop the
Committee may well feel compelled to act in October,"" BNP
Paribas analyst David Tinsley said. 
 Stock markets too have been on edge and while world stocks
as measured by MSCI have recovered somewhat from
the August correction -- the worst monthly loss since 2008, the
index is 16 percent below the 2011 highs hit in May	
 The world index rose a marginal 0.3 percent on Thursday. 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
pared gains after the ECB rate decision. At 1153 GMT, the index
was up 0.5 percent at 936.07 points. 
 
 US DOLLAR, TREASURIES STEADY PRE-BERNANKE	
 Worries for global growth were further underscored by an
OECD report that warned central banks to brace for tough times.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said
on Thursday that developed countries face a sharp year-end
slowdown led by a contraction in Germany. 
 The dollar earlier firmed slightly to the yen and
rose half a percent to a 3-1/2 month high versus the Swiss
franc which has been weakening after Switzerland's central bank
said this week it was determined to cap franc strength.	
 But the greenback will likely stay under pressure before a
1730 GMT speech by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that
some reckon could give hints on the chances of more stimulus.	
 U.S. President Barack Obama is also due to announce plans
for new job creation measures at 2300 GMT.	
 U.S. Treasuries rose slightly but were expected to stay in a
range ahead of the two speeches, with 10-year yields hovering
around 2 percent 
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat opening on Wall Street.
Futures for the S&P 500 , Dow Jones  were flat and
Nasdaq 100  were 0.2 percent higher at 1145 GMT.

 By Sujata Rao	
 LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday and stock markets rose ahead of a European
Central Bank meeting that is likely to flag a halt to its
monetary tightening cycle.	
 With the euro zone economy clearly slowing further, markets
have already firmly priced in an end to the rate hike cycle
which started just two months ago, and the single currency could
in fact get a lift if ECB boss Jean-Claude Trichet quashes
speculation of rate cuts to support economies battered by the
debt crisis.	
 Traders will also be looking at what the central bank says
about the bank's buying of southern European and Irish bonds
given that the ECB is internally divided over the programme	
 ""Markets are a bit cautious going into the ECB rate
meeting,"" said UBS currency analyst Chris Walker. ""We could see
a bounce in the euro as pricing in for rate cuts in October is a
bit far fetched.	
 Walker added however that any bounce would be short-lived as
the continent's financial system and southern European states
remain under serious threat from the debt crisis. 
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.4064 .

 The British pound also fell ahead of a Bank of England
meeting, tumbling to an eight-week low of $1.5917 on
speculation the BOE could announce more stimulus to shore up the
economy. 
 More quantitative easing (QE) in the form of asset purchases
would be negative for the British currency as it would flood the
market with pounds.	
 While most expect the BOE will merely hold rates at a record
low 0.5 percent and avoid adding to its 200 billion pound bond
buying programme, some said the recent run of sluggish economic
data has prompted traders to position for the off-chance of more
stimulus.	
 ""If there's no QE I see a 100 point rally (in the
sterling-dollar exchange rate) before it comes off again,"" a
currency trader in London said.	
 The economic growth worries gripping global markets were
further highlighted by an OECD report that warned central banks
to brace for weaker growth.	
 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
said on Thursday that developed countries face a sharp year-end
slowdown led by a contraction in Germany. 
 
 EQUITIES, DOLLAR UP, PRESSURE REMAINS	
 Equity markets were also on edge. World stocks as measured
by MSCI rose a marginal 0.3 percent, adding to
the previous session's 2.7 percent rally that was fuelled by a
German court's ruling supporting the government's bailouts for
other euro zone states. 
 While the index has recovered somewhat from its August
correction -- the worst monthly loss since 2008, it remains 16
percent below the 2011 highs hit in May. 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
had also gained almost 1 percent by 0900 GMT, led by banking
shares which are benefiting from hopes of a dovish ECB.	
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 77.37 yen and also
firmed to a 3-1/2 month high against the Swiss franc. 
 The latter has continued to weaken against the dollar and
euro after the Swiss central bank said this week it was
determined to cap the currency's strength.	
 However the dollar is likely to stay under pressure,
especially as some traders expect that a 1730 GMT speech by
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke could provide hints on the
likelihood of more stimulus.	
 Initial excitement over U.S. President Barack Obama's plan
to propose new job measures, due at 2300 GMT, has also begun to
wear off amid doubts over how much Washington can spend after
the acrimonious debt ceiling saga just over a month ago. 
 Investors are now eyeing a Group of Seven meeting starting
on Friday for some guidance about what authorities plan next to
avoid a return to recession.	
 Some analysts believe the economic situation is such that
coordinated monetary policy easing may be needed and some banks
such as Barclays predict that the U.S. Federal Reserve would
indulge in a new form of quantitative easing in which it sells
short duration bonds and buys longer ones.	
 German government bonds rose ahead of the ECB announcement
with December Bund futures up 29 ticks and benchmark
10-year yields down one basis point at 1.866
percent.	
 Traders saw scope for a fall in prices after the meeting.	
 ""The risk is that the market is disappointed temporarily if
they don't turn full circle in one meeting, but it's unlikely to
be a dramatic sell-off,"" one bond trader said.

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped in Asia on
Thursday and faces headwinds from suspicions that Europe's
efforts to fix its debt crisis may not be fast enough to keep
markets happy, while the Australian dollar was knocked by a
surprise decline in the country's employment levels.	
 Still, any zeal to sell the common currency is, at least for
now, being countered by expectations that U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke might drop clearer hints on the likelihood
of more stimulus later this month.	
 The market's immediate focus is on the European Central
Bank, which is expected to signal a change in policy direction
by halting an interest-rate rise cycle as the euro zone debt
crisis weighs on the region's economy.	
 Market players will also be looking at what the central bank
says about its buying of southern European and Irish bonds given
that the ECB is internally divided over the programme.	
 ""If Trichet makes cautious remarks on bond buying, Italian
and Spanish spreads could rise again and hurt investor
sentiment,"" said Junya Tanase, chief strategist at JPMorgan
Chase.	
 The bank's chief, Jean-Claude Trichet, will hold a news
conference at 1230 GMT.	
 Constant difficulty in getting all 17 member countries to
agree on policies, including whether to take collateral from
Greece for aid, has even given rise to concerns among some
market players that the euro zone may eventually need to break
up.	
 Fuelling such speculation, the Dutch government,
increasingly critical over euro zone bailouts, said on Wednesday
it wants countries which break the budget rules to be given the
option to leave the single currency area. 
 The euro shed 0.2 percent in Asia to trade at $1.4065
, down about a full cent from a high hit on relief after a
German court did not block the country's involvement in eurozone
bailouts on Wednesday.	
 Major resistance for the euro is seen at around $1.4200, the
38.2 retracement of its fall from late August to early
September.	
 But the currency is still holding above a seven-week low of
$1.3972 hit on Monday, having managed to recover above its
200-day moving average around $1.4015.	
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent to 1.2080 franc but
stayed above the minimum exchange rate the Swiss central bank
imposed on Monday. 
 ""The euro is being supported by the possibility
that the market's focus will shift back to the dollar later
today,"" said Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Trust
Bank.	
 
 DROPPING HINTS	
 Many market players expect the U.S. central bank chief to
drop more hints that the Fed will adopt further easing steps in
his speech due at 1730 GMT, hampering the dollar.	
 Traders also noted that initial excitement over U.S.
President Barack Obama's plan to propose new job measures, due
at 2300 GMT on Thursday, has begun to wear off amid doubts over
how much Washington will be able to spend after the acrimonious
debt ceiling saga in Congress just over a month ago.	
 Against the yen, the greenback stood at 77.31 yen
and is seen stuck around that level as selling from Japanese
exporters is seen capping the pair, likely below 77.50 yen in
Thursday' Asian trade. Wariness about Japanese intervention is
also supporting the dollar. 
 The Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.0590 ,
after Australian employment unexpectedly fell in August while
the jobless rate ticked up to a 10-month high.	
 The disappointing report prompted the Australian money
market futures to price in rate cuts of nearly 0.75 percentage
points by the end of the year, even though the country's economy
had seen robust growth so far thanks to strong demand for raw
materials from China.	
 In Europe, the Bank of England also holds a rate meeting,
though it is expected to hold fire as inflation is stubbornly
high despite a faltering recovery in the UK economy.

 The British pound slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5948 , not
far from two-month low of $1.5919 hit on Wednesday.

In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.27% to hit 1.4059.
Earlier Wednesday, U.S. stocks got a boost from a German court ruling giving the go-ahead to further participation by Europe’s largest economy in the European Financial Stability Facility, a rescue fund for debt threatened euro-zone members.
The German court ruling along with Italian Senate approval of an austerity plan to reduce its the federal budget deficit helped ease concerns over ongoing debt problems in the euro-zone.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.47%, the Nasdaq Composite Index added 3.04%, and the S&P 500 advanced 2.86%.
Market attention turned to a scheduled speech from U.S. President Barack Obama later Thursday, where he was expected to propose a nearly USD300 package to boost the country’s economy and spur employment.
Meanwhile, the greenback was up against the British pound, with GBP/USD down by 0.24% to hit 1.5951. 
The dollar was higher against both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY climbing 0.18% to hit 77.38, and USD/CHF up by 0.19% to hit 0.8589.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Thursday
ahead of a European Central Bank meeting that is expected to
call a halt to its rate tightening cycle to support economies
battered by a two-year-old sovereign debt crisis, while a stock
rally ran out of steam.	
 Euro STOXX 50  index futures slipped 0.2 percent
percent, giving up early gains, after Asian shares outside Japen
edged down as worries about the outlook for the global economy
gnawed at investor confidence.	
 The single currency remained vulnerable to concerns that
efforts to contain the debt crisis are not moving quickly
enough, while the Australian dollar was hit by unexpectedly poor
employment data.	
 ""Volatility still persists and the market is likely to
continue to dance to the tune of policy risks involving the U.S.
and European economies,"" said Kim Hyung-ryol, a market analyst
at Kyobo Securities in Seoul. 
 Global equities suffered their worst correction since 2008
in August, on fears of renewed recession in the United States
and worries about Europe's widening crisis. Despite a modest
bounce in recent sessions, the MSCI All-Country World index
remains 16 percent below its 2011 high, reached
in May.	
 Japan's Nikkei rose 0.3 percent, while MSCI's
broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 0.1 percent. 
 U.S. S&P futures  fell 0.5 percent during the Asian
day, pointing to a softer opening on Wall Street later in the
day.	
 
 Germany's top court on Wednesday rejected lawsuits aimed at
blocking Berlin's participation in bailout packages for Greece
and other heavily indebted euro zone countries, offering some
temporary relief to global markets. 
 European stocks rose 3.1 percent and on Wall Street
the S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent . 
 The euro, after jumping on the German court decision, eased
on Thursday to around $1.4060 , down about 1 cent from the
high hit after the German court decision.	
 
 CHANGE OF TACK	
 The ECB is the only major Western central bank to have
raised rates since the end of the global financial crisis, but
is expected to signal a change in policy tack and halt its
tightening cycle in response to the sovereign debt crisis and
slowing economic growth. 
 The ECB rates decision is due at 1145 GMT, with President
Jean-Claude Trichet's news conference at 1230 GMT.	
 Market players will be closely watching for any comment on
the central bank's buying of Italian and Spanish bonds to force
down yields, a policy that has deeply divided its governing
council.	
 ""If Trichet makes cautious remarks on bond buying, Italian
and Spanish spreads could rise again and hurt investor
sentiment,"" said Junya Tanase, chief strategist at JPMorgan
Chase.	
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is due to speak
later on Thursday, at 1730 GMT, and President Barack Obama will
outline to Congress his plans for reviving the faltering economy
at 2300 GMT. With unemployment stuck above 9 percent, Obama will
lay out a plan to spur job creation.	
 Some analysts think Bernanke may hint at further easing
steps to try to stimulate the economy, which could put downward
pressure on the dollar, although divisions within the Fed could
lead him to stay his hand for now. 
 ""He really can't break new ground given a divided Federal
Reserve,"" said Allen Sinai of Decision Economics.	
 The U.S. currency was a little firmer against the yen at
around 77.33 , while the dollar index , which
measures its performance against a basket of major currencies,
edged up around 0.2 percent.	
 The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to around $1.0587
after employment unexpectedly fell in August, prompting
the money market to price in rate cuts of nearly 0.75 percentage
points by the end of the year.	
 Gold rebounded 1 percent to trade around $1,836 an ounce
, after tumbling 3 percent in the previous session. 
 The precious metal has hit a succession of records, most
recently at $1,920.30 on Tuesday, driven by its appeal as both a
safe haven in times of economic uncertainty and as a hedge
against inflation, which some fear will be the eventual
consequence of the ultra-loose monetary policies being pursued
in much of the developed world.	
 ""Concerns about economic growth in the United States and
euro zone will keep supporting gold prices. Even though we may
see liquidation repeatedly along the way, gold will rise towards
$2,000,"" said a dealer at a Tokyo-based bullion house.	
 Oil was little changed, with U.S. crude edging up to $89.40
a barrel and Brent crude  down 0.1 percent at $115.68.

1397,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2011 07:43PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD falls in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro moved lower against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Thursday, following a German court decision approving the country’s participation in a bailout plan for debt-threatened euro-zone nations.
EUR/USD hit 1.4078 in early Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since Tuesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4084 falling 0.10%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3974, Tuesday’s low, and resistance at 1.4288, last Friday’s high.
Greek and German stock markets surged following a ruling by Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court upholding German participation in last year’s Greek bailout and the formation of the European Financial Stability Facility.
Plaintiffs in the case had sought to block the country’s role in euro-zone bailouts.
The court, however, ruled that future German bailout efforts would require parliamentary approval.
Earlier Wednesday, Italy’s Senate voted to approve a USD76 billion austerity plan to appease demands from the European Central Bank that the country take more aggressive steps to reduce its budget deficit.
European stocks finished Wednesday’s session higher, with France’s CAC 40 rising 3.62% to 3,073.18, Britain’s FTSE 100 climbed 3.14% to 5,318.59, and Germany’s DAX rose sharply by 4.07% to 5,405.53.
The news on Germany and Italy helped ease European debt concerns on Wall Street as U.S. stocks posted their first gain in four days. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.47% to 11,414.86, the Nasdaq Composite Index added 3.04% to 2,548.94 and the S&P 500 advanced 2.86% to close the day at 1,198.62.
Meanwhile, the euro was lower against the both British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP down by 0.04% to hit 0.8814, and EUR/JPY falling 0.02% to hit 108.86.
U.S. President Barack Obama was scheduled to deliver a speech on jobs to a joint session of Congress later Thursday, where he was expected to propose a nearly USD300 package to boost the country’s employment.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro
rallied on Wednesday and gold slid from a record high as a
court ruling supported the German government's efforts to bail
out the crisis-stricken euro zone.
 The European debt crisis has grown more fraught in recent
weeks and efforts within Germany to stop Europe's largest
economy from helping to stabilize the region have pressured
risky assets such as stocks.
 The ruling from its top court cleared the way for Germany
to contribute more to the euro zone's rescue fund. But it also
gave the country's parliament a greater say over bailouts,
which could potentially hamper Germany's ability to act
decisively if the debt crisis worsens.
 ""The message seems to be that while a resolution to the
issues in Europe is not immediate, this shows that they seem to
be on the path of making some progress. That's a huge
positive,"" said Howard Ward, the chief investment officer for
GAMCO Growth in Rye, New York, which has $36.1 billion in
assets under management.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 2.7
percent a day after after hitting its lowest since Aug. 22. The
index is still down about 9 percent for the year.
 Gold prices fell as the sharp rally in stocks prompted
investors to take profits after the precious metal's rally to
record highs in the previous session. Spot gold  dropped
2.8 percent to $1,820.7 in New York.
 The euro  gained 0.6 percent versus the U.S. dollar,
boosted by the German court ruling, and the dollar index <.DXY>
fell 0.6 percent against a basket of major currencies.
 The German court decision ""is an excuse to book some
profits from the last few days but it's not really a game
changer,"" said Omer Esiner, chief markets analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Global markets have been volatile of late as investors have
periodically taken heart from signs that Europe has carved out
a plan to deal with its sovereign debt crisis. But
implementation has been rocky and slow.
 Afflicted countries like Italy and Greece have been
reluctant to push through austerity measures demanded by their
partners, while other nations, such as Germany, have grown more
reluctant to provide aid.
 European stocks <.FTEU3> gained 3.1 percent, having hit a
two-year low on Tuesday. U.S. dollar-denominated Nikkei futures
 were 0.1 percent higher.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 33.38 points,
or 2.86 percent, to 1,198.62. The Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> ended up 275.56 points, or 2.47 percent, at 11,414.86,
and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 75.11 points, or
3.04 percent, to 2,548.94.
 U.S. crude oil  rose to a five-week high bolstered by
the slow recovery in production after a tropical storm and the
threat of further disruptions due to rough weather.
 The Swiss franc, which along with gold had been the
safe-haven of choice for investors, held close to the 1.20 per
euro  target set on Tuesday by the Swiss central bank
to weaken the franc and prevent a recession.
 U.S. President Barack Obama is due to lay out a
job-creation package on Thursday and G7 finance ministers and
central bankers meet in Marseilles, France this weekend to
discuss measures to boost global economic growth.
 ""A lot of investors are thinking about the president's
upcoming speech and whether or not he can say or do something
that will be seen positively,"" LibertyView's Meckler said. ""I
don't think it will be bold enough; I don't think many
investors want to be short before the speech.""
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell as traders booked profits
from a recent rally and as higher stocks undermined the
safe-haven value of U.S. government debt.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was last
trading 19/32 lower in price to yield 2.04 percent, up from
1.98 percent late Tuesday.

 * German court ruling boosts risk appetite

 * Swedish crown gains amid search for safety
(Adds comment, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Wednesday
as sovereign debt worries abated temporarily after a German
court backed the country's role in euro zone bailouts, though
gains may be limited ahead of a European Central Bank meeting.
 Risk appetite improved as a result of the German court's
decision, pushing the dollar lower as investors sought other
currencies that offer higher returns such as the Australian
dollar and Swedish crown.
 In addition, a call by Chicago Federal Reserve President
Charles Evans, a voting member of the central bank's Federal
Open Market Committee, for further U.S. easing to stimulate
jobs was also a negative for the greenback.
 Investors though looked to Thursday's ECB meeting and were
back to scrutinizing ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's
messages which can sometimes be unclear. Analysts expect the
ECB to flag a pause in tightening due to slowing global growth,
easing inflation, and nagging euro zone debt concerns. Some
even suggested that the ECB could sound outright dovish.
 ""In the longer term, you've got to believe that the euro is
very much under pressure. The euro tried to rally on the German
court decision, but its attempt has so far been weak,"" said
Dean Popplewell, chief FX strategist, at OANDA in Toronto.
 ""Tomorrow investors expect the ECB to tweak its statement
to appease the doves,"" he added, and that has injected some
element of caution in buying euros.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro was up 0.7 percent on
the day at $1.40990  on electronic trading platform
EBS, off a session high of $1.41504 hit immediately after the
German Constitutional Court's ruling. The euro though was still
down 2.0 percent this month.
 Although the court's decision was seen as positive for the
euro, the court also said parliament must have a bigger say
before aid is granted, which could potentially make a solution
to the euro zone debt crisis more cumbersome. [ID:nL5E7K72PX].
 Data showing German industrial output rose more than
expected in July and a rise in equities supported the euro as
did the Italian Senate's approval of the austerity program
aimed at staving off a financial crisis. For details, see
[ID:nLDE7860S2]
 The euro held gains against the Swiss franc, which fell for
a second straight day after the Swiss National Bank on Tuesday
said it would set a floor of 1.20 francs to the euro by buying
foreign currencies in unlimited quantities. The euro was last
up 0.3 percent at 1.21000 francs  on EBS.
 The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.4 percent at 0.85820
franc on EBS .
 The ICE dollar index <.DXY> was down 0.7 percent at
75.448.
 Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT in New York,
said the dollar's weakness was partly due to Evans' call for
further U.S. stimulus. ""Evans is a FOMC voting member and so
his opinions carry great weight within the bank,"" she said.
 SWEDISH CROWN, AUSSIE RISE
 As investors fled the safety of the franc following the
SNB's move on Tuesday, it was the Swedish crown's turn to
shine.
 Investors had snapped up the Norwegian crown on Tuesday --
a currency with robust economic fundamentals -- as they
frantically searched for an alternative safe haven.
 The Swedish crown rose to a three-month high against the
euro  after Sweden's central bank said further
monetary tightening would be postponed but did not signal any
intent to cut rates, as some investors had expected it would.
[ID:nL5E7K70KR]
 ""The Swedish crown is very attractive for a euro-based
investor because the ECB is starting to look like it may cut
rates,"" said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe
Generale in London.
 ""Only a few days ago the crown was trading below its
short-term fair value based on rate differentials. Now people
are rushing into it.""
 Commodity currencies also rose, with the Australian dollar
up 1.5 percent at US$1.0651 , buoyed by a report
showing the Australian economy grew at its fastest pace in four
years last quarter.
 The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.4 percent against the yen
at 77.284 yen  on EBS.
 Traders said the yen was supported by the Bank of Japan's
decision to keep policy unchanged. Some market players had
expected Japan to take measures to stem the yen's strength
after Tuesday's move by the SNB.

 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets
rose from a two-week low on Wednesday and gold tumbled from a
record high after Germany's top court rejected lawsuits aimed
at blocking Berlin's participation in bailout packages for
Greece and other euro zone countries.
 The ruling cleared the way for Germany to contribute more

also gave the country's parliament a greater say over euro zone
bailouts, potentially hampering the government's ability to act

 Though investors have periodically taken heart from signs

 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Wednesday after Germany's top court rejected lawsuits
aimed at blocking participation in euro zone bailouts, though
the single currency remained vulnerable ahead of the European
Central Bank's rate decision on Thursday.
 Slowing global growth, easing inflation and mounting euro
zone debt concerns are likely to see the ECB flag a pause in
its rate tightening cycle at its governing council meeting,
with an outside chance it could even sound dovish.
 The German court decision ""is an excuse to book some

single currency, the court also said parliament must have a
bigger say before aid is granted, potentially making a solution
to the euro zone debt crisis more cumbersome. [ID:nL5E7K70Q9]
 ""It could hamper (German) participation going forward,""
said Esiner. ""It's a double-edge sword.""
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the court
left it free to the government to agree to aid agreements in
the euro zone with other countries and inform parliament
afterwards. [ID:nB4E7JN02O].
 Data showing German industrial output rose more than
expected in July and a rise in equities supported the euro. But
analysts said it could struggle ahead of the ECB decision and
sink back under its 200-day moving average around $1.40194 at
current prices.
 Traders said it had support above $1.40 after failing to
make a sustained break below there on Tuesday, but said
investors were still inclined to sell on rallies. That left it
vulnerable to a drop towards the July 12 low at $1.38376.
 The euro retained hefty gains made against the Swiss franc
on Tuesday after the Swiss National Bank said it would enforce
a limit of 1.20 francs to the euro by buying foreign currencies
in unlimited quantities. It was last steady at 1.20722 francs
.
 SWEDISH CROWN, AUSSIE RISE
 The Swedish crown rose to a three-month high 
after Sweden's central bank said further monetary tightening
would be postponed but did not signal any intent to cut rates,
as some investors had been speculating. [ID:nL5E7K70KR]
 Analysts said the market was increasingly seeing the
Swedish currency -- along with Norway's crown -- as a safe
alternative to the euro after the SNB curbed appetite for the
franc.
 ""There is a tremendous amount of desperation around.
Everybody is asking where the new safe haven is,"" said
Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale. 
 ""The Swedish crown is very attractive for a euro-based
investor because the ECB is starting to look like it may cut
rates. Only a few days ago the crown was trading below its
short-term fair value based on rate differentials. Now people
are rushing into it.""
 Commodity currencies also rose, with the Australian dollar
up 1.2 percent at $1.0618 , according to Reuters data,
buoyed by data showing the Australian economy grew at its
fastest pace in four years last quarter.
 Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.6 percent at 77.217
yen  on EBS.
 Traders said the yen was supported by the Bank of Japan's
decision to keep policy unchanged. Some market players had
expected Japan to take measures to stem the yen's strength
after Tuesday's move by the SNB.[ID:nL3E7K71B4][ID:nL3E7K70EE]

 LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - World stocks rose from a two-week
low on Wednesday and the euro rebounded across the board after
Germany's top court rejected lawsuits aimed at blocking Berlin's
participation in bailout packages for Greece and other euro zone
countries.	
 The Constitutional Court also handed the country's
parliament a greater say over euro zone bailouts, potentially
hampering the government's ability to act decisively against a
two-year-old debt crisis.	
 But it at least cleared the way for Germany to contribute
more to the euro zone's rescue fund, giving temporary relief to
investors after this week's sharp sell-off in risky assets.	
 Better-than-expected data on the U.S. services sector and
Australian growth as well as speculation that Washington may
unveil a $300 billion package to create new jobs also helped
improve the mood.	
 ""Today's ruling should bring some relief to financial
markets as a total chaos scenario has been avoided but it should
not lead to euphoria,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.	
 ""The ruling confirms our view that the German piecemeal
approach on the debt crisis is not likely to change but
eventually the German parliament will vote in favour of a second
Greek bailout package and the beefed-up EFSF."" 
 MSCI world equity index rose 1 percent after
hitting its lowest since Aug. 22 on Tuesday. The benchmark index
is still down more than 10 percent.	
 European stocks gained 1.9 percent, having hit a
two-year low in the previous day.	
 ""We got a brief pop higher in equity markets. It doesn't
really change much, except the perception that the euro might
collapse, if the Germans ruled (bailouts) unconstitutional, so
that fear has gone in the short term,"" said Michael Hewson,
market analyst at CMC Markets. 
 Emerging stocks added 1.9 percent. U.S. stock
futures were up around 1 percent , pointing to a firmer
open on Wall Street later.	
 U.S. crude oil  rose 1.2 percent to $87.09 a barrel.	
 
 GROWTH MEASURES	
 Investors also looked ahead for measures to boost growth
from Group of Seven finance ministers meeting this weekend and
separately from U.S. President Barack Obama.	
 IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has called for
governments to consider recapitalising banks and adjusting
budget austerity drives to support growth, the concerns at the
centre of market weakness since late July.	
 Sources told Reuters G7 finance ministers will discuss
measures at a summit at the end of the week and CNN cited
Democratic sources on Wednesday saying that Obama plans to lay
out a job-creation package on Thursday with new spending offset
by budget cuts .	
 Bund futures  fell 50 ticks, tracking a dip in U.S.
Treasuries after the CNN report.	
 The dollar gained 0.5 percent against a basket of
major currencies.	
 The euro had risen as much as 0.8 percent to $1.4100
at one point, after falling as low as $1.3971 on Tuesday.	
 ""There's been a lot of pessimism priced into the market this
week but we're grinding through the worst of it so
understandably we've had a mini pull-back here,"" said Nomura
rate strategist Sean Maloney. ""But event risk remains high and
we expect more pitfalls to come."" 
 The Swiss franc, which had been along with gold the safe
haven of choice for investors, held within the 1.2000 per euro
target set on Tuesday by the Swiss central bank to
weaken the franc and prevent a recession.	
 The dollar lost half a percent to 77.16 yen . 
 The Bank of Japan kept its policy settings unchanged and
maintained its assessment that the economy was steadily picking
up, with output and exports nearly returning to levels before a
devastating earthquake and tsunami in March tipped Japan into
recession.

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 7 (Reuters) - European stocks were poised to
follow Asian shares higher on Wednesday as investors hunted for
bargains, while the euro edged up against the dollar as traders
covered some bets against the common currency following a sharp
overnight fall.	
 The constellation of asset price action reflected risk
taking among investors, who had been mostly driven for the past
few weeks by fears that still lingered about a euro zone break
up and global recession. 
 The Australian dollar rallied 1 percent, climbing above
$1.06 , U.S. Treasury yields edged higher and gold
tumbled on a sudden large sell order in thin trading conditions.	
 The Swiss franc, which had been along with gold the safe
haven of choice for investors, kept to a relatively tight
trading range above 1.2000 per euro , the day after
the Swiss central bank said it would buy foreign currencies in
""unlimited quantities"" to enforce a cap on the currency versus
the euro. 
 ""The stock market is rebounding after steep
declines in recent days, but the situation has not changed and
volatility remains high,"" said Korea Investment Trust Management
fund manager Kim Young-il in Seoul.	
 ""Uncertainty is high about the direction of the U.S.
economy, and uncertainty is even higher in Europe as investors
are not sure whether the bloc is going in the right direction.""	
 
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 2.0 percent,
coming off a two-and-a-half year closing low on Tuesday, and
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
gained 2.3 percent.	
 The biggest gainers in the MSCI index were the tech and
materials sectors, as electronics exporters such as South
Korea's Samsung Electronics and miners like
Australia's BHP Billiton posted strong gains.	
 Shares of electronics makers have taken some of the worst
beatings in the global market rout of recent weaks on mounting
worries about slowing consumer and corporate demand.	
 The Nikkei was trading at a price-to-book ratio of 0.95 as
of Tuesday's close. That was the lowest since Aug. 24 and before
that the lowest since April 1, 2009. A price-to-book ratio below
1.0 for the Nikkei means that the market value of every stock in
the index is less than if all the companies' assets were
liquidated.	
 Value-driven investors, though, were not returning in hordes
to scoop up bargains.	
 ""It's a short-term rebound. I'm rather pessimistic,"" said
Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.	
 
 AUSTERITY DEMANDS	
 The euro zone's most indebted and high risk nations were
scrambling on Wednesday to convince investors and the rest of
Europe of their commitment to tackle their debt problems, even
as the bloc's main paymaster Germany faced increasing opposition
to further aid. 
 An unexpected jump in a U.S. services sector index, however,
helped stocks on Wall Street pare losses into the close and end
down less than 1 percent.	
 S&P 500 futures  traded in Asia rose about 0.6 percent
on Wednesday. 
 Investors are now focusing on a speech by U.S. President
Barack Obama to Congress on Thursday, which CNN reported would
include plans for a $300 billion jobs package. 
 The euro rose about 0.4 percent to around $1.4060 ,
still not far from a two-month trough plumbed on Tuesday.	
 The dollar, pressured by disappointment that the Bank of
Japan took no action at a policy meeting, was down 0.6 percent
at around 77.19 yen , coming off an overnight high of
77.74. 
 Speculation had risen on Tuesday that Japan may introduce
measures to curb currency strength after Switzerland's shock
move.	
 The Swiss franc plunged nearly 10 percent
against the euro on Tuesday, its biggest daily fall ever, after
the Swiss central bank jolted markets by drawing a line in the
sand on how much the currency can gain. 
 ""While we would not stand in the way of the SNB move, we
question whether the SNB will be fully successful in maintaining
1.20 if global risks accelerate,"" BNP Paribas strategists wrote
in a note.	
 In commodities markets, spot gold fell further after
striking a new record above $1,920 following the Swiss National
Bank move. A large sell order caught traders off guard and
triggered automatic sell orders, taking the metal to as low as
$1,826.18.	
 Brent crude prices rose on Tuesday after three straight
declines as tight North Sea supplies, continuing uncertainty
about Libya's oil and more tropical storms boosted prices. 
 Brent crude  was up about 0.4 percent to $113.30 a
barrel on Wednesday, while U.S. crude gained 0.4 percent to
$86.35 a barrel.

In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.22% to hit 1.4030.
Earlier Tuesday, the Swiss franc plunged versus its major counterparts, including the euro, as the Swiss National Bank set a floor for EUR/CHF at 1.20 in an effort to lessen the negative effects a strong currency would have on exports.
The move by Switzerland’s central bank comes at a critical time for negotiations between European finance officials who are debating the details of the European Financial Stability Facility, a bailout fund for debt threatened euro-zone members.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Institute of Supply Management reported its non-manufacturing purchasing manager’s index rose by 0.6 in August to 53.3 from 52.7 the previous month.
Economists had forecast the index to fall to 51.0 for the month.
An ISM manufacturing index above 50.0 indicates expansion in the non-manufacturing sector, while below 50.0 is a sign of general contraction.
Wall Street shares rallied from session lows but still finished in the red for a third consecutive session, dragged down by European debt jitters and last week’s disappointing U.S. jobs data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9%, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.26%, and the S&P 500 shed 0.74%.
Meanwhile, the greenback was down against the British pound, with GBP/USD up by 0.18% to hit 1.5973. 
The dollar was lower against both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY dropping 0.32% to hit 77.40, and USD/CHF down by 0.38% to hit 0.8589. 
The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD down 0.11% to hit 0.9891, AUD/USD higher by 0.87% to hit 1.0575, and NZD/USD gaining 0.30% to hit 0.8251.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.30% at 75.83.

In mid-day Asian trade USD/JPY hit 77.71, the pair’s highest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 77.40, dropping 0.33%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.29, the low of August 11, and resistance at 78.34, the high of August 8.
Earlier Tuesday, the Swiss franc plunged versus its major counterparts, including the euro, as the Swiss National Bank set a floor for EUR/CHF at 1.20 in an effort to lessen the negative effects a strong currency would have on exports.
The Swiss central bank’s decision spurred speculation that the Bank of Japan would follow Switzerland’s lead and intervene in exchange markets to weaken the yen against its counterparts.
The BOJ stepped in on August 4, as USD/JPY fell below 77.01, and was scheduled to wrap up its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday.
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi said he will press Group of Seven officials about the dangers a strong yen presents to Japan’s economy when he meets them for the first time in Marseille, France, on Sept. 9.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rebounded on
Wednesday as investors hunted for bargains after the latest
market slide, while the euro edged up against the dollar as
traders covered some bets against the common currency following
a sharp overnight fall.	
 The Swiss franc was nursing 10 percent losses against the
single currency after the country's central bank said it would
buy foreign currencies in ""unlimited quantities"" to enforce a
limit of 1.20 francs to the euro .	
 Global equity markets had tumbled in recent days --
following a sharp slide in August -- on fears of renewed
recession in the United States and Europe's worsening debt
crisis, boosting ""safe haven"" assets such as gold and the Swiss
franc.

 In Tokyo, analysts said a 5.2 percent drop in equity prices
over the past three days had left stocks trading at a
price-to-book ratio of 0.92, the lowest level this year. Still,
there were doubts that Wednesday's gains would be sustained
despite the cheaper valuation. 
 ""It's a short-term rebound. I'm rather pessimistic,"" said
Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.	
 
 AUSTERITY DEMANDS	
 Europe's drive to halt its crippling two-year debt crisis
looked increasingly at risk on Tuesday amid doubts about the
will in Italy and Greece to push through austerity demanded by
their partners, and hardening opposition to further aid in the
bloc's chief paymaster Germany.	
 An unexpected jump in a U.S. services sector index, however,
helped stocks on Wall Street pare losses into the close and end
down less than a percent. S&P 500 futures  traded in Asia
rose about 0.6 percent on Wednesday. 
 Investors are now focusing on a speech by U.S. President
Barack Obama to Congress on Thursday, which CNN reported would
include plans for a $300 billion jobs package. 
 The European Central Bank's governing council is also
holding a rate-setting policy meeting on Thursday.	
 The ECB is the only major Western central bank to have
raised rates since the 2008/09 financial crisis, but is expected
to signal a change in policy course by halting its tightening
cycle. 
 The euro rose about 0.3 percent to around $1.4030 ,
still not far from a two-month trough plumbed on Tuesday.	
 The dollar, pressured by high-yielding currencies
rebounding on stronger stocks, was down 0.2 percent at around
77.40 yen , coming off an overnight high of 77.74. 
 The Swiss franc plunged nearly 10 percent
against the euro on Tuesday, its biggest daily fall ever, after

EUR/USD hit 1.4008 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4003 gaining 0.03%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3838, the low of July 12, and resistance at 1.4378, last Thursday’s high.

“With immediate effect, the SNB will no longer tolerate a EUR/CHF exchange rate below the minimum rate of CHF 1.20. The SNB will enforce this minimum rate with the utmost determination and is prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities,” the SNB said in a statement.
The move by Switzerland’s central bank comes at a critical time for negotiations between European finance officials who are debating the details of the European Financial Stability Facility, a bailout fund for debt threatened euro-zone members.
European stocks ended Tuesday trading mixed as France’s CAC 40 dropped 1.1% to 2,965.64, Britain’s FTSE 100 added 1% to 5,156.84, and Germany’s DAX fell by 1% to 5,193.97, after sinking more than 5% in Monday trade.

 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell on
Tuesday on worries of the European debt crisis worsening, while
the Swiss central bank's bold move to slow the safe-haven rush
into its currency caused a record 10 percent drop of the franc
versus the euro.
 Nervous investors channeled cash into less-risky assets as
doubts resurfaced over Italian and Greek willingness to
implement tough budget and debt measures demanded by other euro
zone members, while Germany hardened its stand against giving
more aid. For details, see [ID:nL5E7K61RE]
 ""Europe is where you have to be focused right now, and
Europe doesn't look good,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing
director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
 Wall Street stocks, after losing more than 2 percent
earlier in the session, ended down less than 1 percent after a
three-day holiday weekend, with Friday's U.S. jobs report,
which showed zero net jobs growth, also hurting investor
confidence. [.N]
 The Swiss central bank set a limit of 1.20 francs to the
euro in an attempt to keep the currency's strength from hurting
exports. Global investors have poured money into the Swiss
franc seeking a relatively safe asset.
 The move led to some selling of gold after it touched a
record high above $1,900 an ounce.
 U.S. and German government debt, perceived as safer assets,
along with gold amid the turmoil, rallied and pushed benchmark
yields to historic lows.

 NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell on
Tuesday on worries of the European debt crisis worsening, while
the Swiss central bank's bold move to slow the safe-haven rush
into its currency, which it fears could harm its economy,
caused a record 10 percent drop of the franc versus the euro.
 Nervous investors channeled cash into less-risky assets as
doubts resurfaced over Italian and Greek willingness to
implement tough budget and debt measures demanded by other euro
zone members, while Germany hardened its stand against giving
more aid. For details, see [ID:nL5E7K61RE]
 ""Europe is where you have to be focused right now, and
Europe doesn't look good,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing
director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
 Wall Street stocks, after losing more than 2 percent
earlier in the session, ended down less than 1 percent after a
three-day holiday weekend, with Friday's U.S. jobs report,
which showed zero net jobs growth, also hurting investor
confidence. [.N]
 The Swiss central bank set a limit of 1.20 francs to the
euro in an attempt to keep the currency's strength from hurting
its exports. Global investors have poured money into the Swiss
franc seeking a relatively safe asset.
 The move led to some selling of gold after it touched a
record high above $1,900 an ounce.
 U.S. and German government debt, perceived as safer assets
along with gold amid the turmoil, rallied and pushed benchmark
yields to historic lows.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc plunged nearly
10 percent against the euro on Tuesday, ending four days of
gains, after Switzerland's central bank jolted markets by
setting a limit on how much its currency can strengthen versus
the single currency.
 The euro surged on trading platform EBS to 1.22 francs from
a low of 1.10200 and a closing level at 1.11000 on Monday, its
largest one-day gain ever, after the Swiss National Bank set a
rate target of 1.20 francs to the euro  to bolster
its export-oriented economy. The bank said it would enforce its
stance by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities.
[ID:nL5E7K61FL].
 Many analysts believed the SNB may have finally instilled
fear in investors still trying to seek shelter in the franc
away from the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis. The SNB's
ability, however, to hold the floor at 1.20 francs to the euro
will very much depend on developments in the euro area.
 ""An intensification of the euro zone crisis is a reasonable
prospect and such an event could yet result in a significant
step up in demand for the Swiss franc,"" said Jane Foley, senior
currency strategist at Rabobank in London.
 However, since there is zero inflation in Switzerland, the
SNB could potentially just print francs and sell them on an
unlimited basis to counter the surge in currency inflows. For
this reason, Foley believes the 1.20 cap on the euro/Swiss
franc could hold in the near term.
 The euro was last up 8.9 percent at 1.20700 francs.
 The Swiss franc has dropped roughly 20 percent versus the
euro in the past month as the single currency has soared from a
lifetime low of 1.00750 hit on Aug. 9 on EBS.
 As a result, fund managers who took bets that the franc
would fall around that time were sitting on hefty gains.
 The U.S. dollar rose as high as 0.86250 franc  on
EBS and was last up 9.5 percent at 0.86180 franc, snapping a
four-day drop against the franc.
 The latest SNB move comes after it cut its already low
interest rate target to nil on Aug. 3. It also flooded the
banking system with francs, effectively driving money market
and forward rates deep into negative territory and making
holding Swiss francs a costly proposition for investors.
 FLOWS INTO NORWAY
 The Swiss central bank action also funneled some safe-haven
flows into the Norwegian crown, a currency with robust
fundamentals -- an oil exporter and a country with a current
account surplus. The euro fell 1.6 percent against Norway's
crown to 7.5427 .
 One-month implied volatility on the euro/Norwegian crown
pair, a measure of the market's expectations of future
movements in either direction, jumped to 9.7 percent
 from 8.4 percent late on Monday, suggesting more
trading action seen on this cross.

 Despite the euro's steep gains against the Swiss franc, the
single currency fell against the dollar, down 0.5 percent on
the day at $1.40140 . It fell to a low of $1.39720,
trading below its 200-day moving average around $1.40150 for
the first time since July 12.
 Market players said the key risk for the euro this week was
that the European Central Bank would signal a pause in its rate
tightening cycle.
 Concerns that the next tranche of bailout funds for Greece
may be delayed, worries about European bank funding and rising
Italian government bond yields on speculation Rome may struggle
to implement new austerity measures kept the euro under
pressure.
 The dollar rose against the yen on EBS  on
speculation the SNB's measures could encourage Japanese
authorities to intervene in coming days. The dollar was up 0.8
percent at 77.505, well off a record low of 75.941 struck on
Aug 19.

 NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell on
Tuesday on fears about a U.S. recession and the European debt
crisis worsening, while the Swiss franc sagged against the euro
after Switzerland's central bank sought to slow the safe-haven
stampede into its currency.
 The Swiss central bank's move to peg its currency to the
euro at 1.20 francs reduced the safe-haven appeal of gold, but
the precious metal was not far from its record high above

 Nervous investors channeled cash into less risky U.S. and

 By Anirban Nag and Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc plummeted versus
the euro and dollar on Tuesday, after Switzerland's central bank
shocked markets by setting a floor for the euro/Swiss exchange
rate in an effort to curb franc strength which has taken a toll
on the economy.	
 The euro rocketed nearly 0.1 francs after the Swiss National
Bank set a rate target of 1.20 francs to the euro and
said it would enforce it by buying foreign currency in unlimited
quantities. 
 However, many analysts questioned whether the move could
succeed given the robust demand for safe-haven assets that drove
the franc to record highs last month.	
 Within minutes of the announcement, the euro leapt to 1.22
francs on trading platform EBS, its highest since early July and
up 10 percent on the day. It pulled back to 1.2040, but was
still on track for the biggest daily percentage move in a major
currency pair in recent memory.	
 The dollar also jumped to 0.85799 francs from around
0.8000, while the euro rose to $1.4286 , up more than 1
percent on the day after trading almost flat beforehand. It was
last up 0.6 percent at $1.4172.	
 ""The SNB's move is somewhat sudden and aggressive,"" said
Paul Mackel, senior FX strategist at HSBC in Hong Kong.	
 ""However, it needs to be aggressive to turn the tide for the
Swiss franc and to take the shine off its safe-haven status.
Putting euro/Swiss franc at 1.20 today is the easy part. Keeping
it there or significantly above will be difficult if the world
still looks like a gloomy place.""	
 Some analysts were sceptical the SNB would be able to fight
franc strength for long, as it faces huge losses on its balance
sheet if it keeps the proceeds of franc selling in euros.	
 At the same time, tame Swiss inflation allowed the bank more
leeway to keep the target in place for some time, as a weaker
currency was unlikely to fuel significantly higher price risks.	
 ""The target is designed to be temporary in nature and will
be removed as soon as the euro zone situation stabilises and a
significant interest rate differential is established between
the ECB and the SNB,"" said Geoffrey Yu, strategist at UBS.	
 ""Nevertheless, this is far easier said than done and the SNB
will remain beholden to external developments.""	
 The latest SNB move comes after it cut its already low
interest rate target to nil on Aug. 3. It also flooded the
banking system with francs, effectively driving money market and
forward rates deep into negative territory and making holding
Swiss francs a costly proposition for investors.

 
 EURO RISKS AHEAD	
 The Swiss franc has dropped roughly 20 percent versus the
euro in the past month as the single currency has soared from a
lifetime low of 1.0075 hit in early August. 
 As a result, fund managers who took on bets that the franc
would fall around that time were sitting on hefty gains. 
 ""From last month I thought it was time to get cautious on
the Swiss franc,"" said Pierre Lequeux, head of FX management at
Aviva Investors, adding he had entered a small bet in favour of
the New Zealand dollar over the franc in the past few weeks. 
 ""It's been an 18 percent move since we took out the
position, which is not bad for a few weeks,"" he said, adding he
had also taken a small long position in the Norwegian crown
versus the franc. Aviva Investors's parent company, Aviva Plc,
manages $371 bln in assets. 
 Morgan Stanley analysts argued in a note the SNB action was
unlikely to help the euro much, and could even increase market
speculation the European Central Bank would become less hawkish
and prepare the ground for rate cuts.	
 Market players said the key risk for the euro this week was
that the ECB would signal a pause in its rate hike cycle.	
 Concerns the next tranche of bailout funds for Greece may be
delayed, worries about European bank funding and rising Italian
government bond yields on speculation Rome may struggle to
implement new austerity measures kept the euro under pressure.	
 The dollar rose against the yen on speculation the
SNB's measures could encourage the Japanese authorities to
intervene in coming days. The dollar was up 0.3 percent at
77.11, off a record low of 75.94 struck on Aug 19.	
 ""The SNB's move has created some paranoia about central bank
intervention and some speculative positions could be cut,"" said
Lequeux at Aviva.	
 The dollar index rose 0.2 percent on the day to
75.249, having earlier climbed to a one-month high at 75.305.

 LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank turned
the tables on Tuesday on investors who have driven up the franc,
sinking it nearly 9 percent against the euro, while European
stocks added to the sharp losses of a day earlier.	
 Wall Street also looked set to open lower in its first
trading day since Friday's moribund U.S. jobs report.	
 Core German debt yields stayed near historic lows, well
below 2 percent, signalling a frenzied search for safety was
undisturbed.	
 European banking stocks, battered by fears of exposure to
both euro zone peripheral debt and a U.S. lawsuit over
mortgage-backed securities, took another hit, adding a
two-thirds of a percent loss to the near 6 percent drop on
Monday.	
 The Swiss National Bank's move to intervene directly in
markets went some way to reversing one of the recent major
trends -- investors dumping euro and dollar assets for the
safety of the franc. It set a target of 1.20 francs to the euro
that it would enforce by unlimited buying of other
currencies.	
The franc has soared against the euro and the
dollar as investors bought the currency as a secure place
for their money given the U.S. and euro zone debt crises.	
 This has threatened the Swiss economy, the bank said.	
 After the announcement, the euro was trading at just above
the 1.20 Swiss franc target after earlier being at around 1.10
francs.	
 The euro also firmed against the dollar and was trading at
$1.4131 
 ""One will think twice about speculating against this target
because the SNB is with its back against the wall,"" said
Alessandro Bee, economist at Bank Sarasin.	
 The Swiss move rocked a number of other assets, notably gold
which lost some allure to trade at $1,890 an ounce. 
 
 STOCK FIRMER	
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were down a
third of a percent, getting off to a poor start with a catch-up
fall of 2.2 percent on Japan's Nikkei .	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was down nearly
half a percent after falling more than 4 percent on Monday on
renewed worries about the euro zone's ability to solve its debt
problems.	
 ""These persistent euro zone worries are back in play once
again amidst signs that austerity measures may be faltering,
whilst last Friday's disappointing (U.S.) non-farm payrolls
(data) continue to leave the markets with something of a
hangover,"" said Cameron Peacock, analyst at IG Markets.	
 At a banking conference in Frankfurt, the chief executives
of both Societe Generale and Commerzbank said bank earnings
would be less in the future, partly due to the euro zone crisis.	
""There is a direct link between state balance sheets and bank
balance sheets,"" Commerzbank's Martin Blessing said, adding that
about 50 percent of sovereign bonds are held by local banks in
most countries.	
 Market reaction to the euro zone crisis is being exaggerated
by global concern about the state of the U.S. economy, which is
in danger of slipping back into recession.	
 Europe's own economy is also weak.	
 Japanese, Chinese and South Korean financial regulators
discussed the global threats in a conference call.	
 ""We are already at stall speed in the U.S. and Europe, which
means we are now more likely than not to see a recession,"" said
Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore's finance minister.

 By Antoni Slodkowski and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The euro hit a seven week
low on Tuesday as the euro zone debt crisis deepened overnight,
hovering right above more key chart support levels that if
breached could lead to a sharper sell-off in the single
currency.	
 While the euro has taken a beating against other currencies,
it has held up remarkably well versus the dollar on buying from
central banks, but a break of chart levels could finally yank
the legs from under it, traders said.	
 A more decisive fall below its August low of $1.4055 could
pull the euro under its 200-day moving average at $1.4015 for
the first time since January, opening the way for a further
slide towards the July spike low of $1.3838.	
 The euro last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.4057, having
dipped as low as $1.4038. Below this level, traders said, orders
mixed with both stop-loss selling and bids related to an option
barrier lurking at $1.4000. 
 The euro also fell to a six-month low versus the Japanese
yen at 107.95 yen .	
 Market players were unanimous in thinking that the euro was
poised to extend its longest losing streak since April, hurt by
soft equities and after Italian bonds were sold on worries Rome
is not doing enough to bring its debt under control. 
 ""I don't think the euro can eke out even modest gains today.
The euro zone crisis has been deepening and it's very hard to
find any potential for a positive surprise in the near term,""
said Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign exchange research
at Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 Underscoring investor angst over a watered down Italian
austerity package, the cost of insuring Italian debt against
default rose above that of Spain for the first time since Dec.
2009, while European stocks tumbled 4 percent on Monday.	
 The heaviest pressure on the euro emerged from the
safe-haven Swiss franc which inched back up towards a record
high versus the dollar adding 0.2 percent to 0.7853 . The
euro fell 0.6 percent to 1.1023 francs , off a recent
peak of 1.1970 francs marked last Monday.	
 The pair found some respite around its immediate support at
the kijun line on their daily chart at 1.1027 francs, but
traders expect more falls in the pair unless the Swiss National
Bank starts intervening in currency markets again.	
 
 MORE RISK AHEAD 
 Traders said the key risk for the common currency this week
is if the European Central Bank takes on a dovish stance at
Thursday's policy meeting.	
 ""Without the support of a more hawkish central bank, the
euro will look very vulnerable,"" Societe Generale strategists
Kit Juckes and Sebastien Galy wrote in a note, adding a fall
below $1.3900 could easily take the common currency back to
$1.3000.	
 The euro zone itself also faces a testing time, not least
Greece's ongoing dispute with the EU and IMF on fiscal slippages
which threatens to delay the next tranche of aid, worries about
European bank funding and legal challenges to bailouts.	
 On top of that, on Tuesday the Finance Ministers of Germany,
the Netherlands and Finland will meet to discuss the issue of
collateral for loans to Greece.	
 The euro's weakness saw the dollar index climb to a
one month high at 75.305. Dollar/yen, though, continued in a
tight range on either side of 76.80 yen , contained by the
threat of yen-weakening intervention from Japan.	
 Last Friday, the closely watched U.S. non-farm payrolls
report showed jobs growth grounded to a halt last month adding
to fears about a U.S. recession and raising hopes the Federal
Reserve will add more stimulus.	
 Markets though appeared to be starting to come around to the
idea the Fed will do this by increasing the maturity of the
assets in its balance sheets, known as 'operation twist', rather
than launch a fresh round of bond buying, or QE3.	
 Right now this is not hurting the greenback too much, but
some analysts suspect the Fed will have to go all in at some
point.	
 ""If and when QE3 does eventually happen (as our economists
expect), we would expect a further rally in equities and the
U.S. dollar resuming its downtrend,"" said the analysts at SG.	
 Commodity currencies struggled after coming under heavy
pressure as most Asian bourses fell and S&P futures extended
losses to 2.5 percent .	
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.4 percent to
$1.0508, having hit a session low of $1.4038 earlier in the
session. It was down some 2-1/2 cents from last week's peak.	
 Australia's central bank held interest rates steady at 4.75
percent for a tenth month on Tuesday as turmoil in global
markets has clouded the outlook for the world
economy.

In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.18% to hit 1.4072.
Late last week, the U.S. Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls were unchanged in August, the weakest job reading in a year.  Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August, after a revised 85,000 gain in July.
Stagnant job growth raised further speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank may be preparing for a new round of asset buying, or quantitative easing.
Adding to market unease, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union was roundly defeated in her home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, setting the stage for a new round of debate on Germany’s role in expanding the powers of the European Financial Stability Facility. 
The election result may hinder efforts to grant additional powers to the bailout fund, ahead of a ruling on the legality of the latest bailout for Greece, due to be decided by Germany’s Constitutional Court later this week.
European stocks were off sharply in Monday trade, with France’s CAC 40 dropping 4.73% to 2,999.54, Britain’s FTSE 100 slumped 3.58% to 5,102.58, and Germany’s DAX plummeted by 5.28% to 5,246.18.
Meanwhile, the greenback was up against the British pound, with GBP/USD down by 0.20% to hit 1.6084. 
The dollar was lower against both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY dropping 0.11% to hit 76.78, and USD/CHF down by 0.23% to hit 0.7852. 
The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD up 0.05% to hit 0.9910, AUD/USD lower by 0.27% to hit 1.0521, and NZD/USD falling 0.36% to hit 0.8290.

In mid-day Asian trade USD/JPY hit 76.96, the pair’s highest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 76.82, dropping 0.09%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.29, the low of August 11, and resistance at 77.24, last Thursday’s high.
The U.S. Labor Department reported late last week that non-farm payrolls remained flat in August, the weakest job reading in a year.  Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August, after a revised 85,000 gain in July.
Concerns in Japan over the European debt crisis translated into steep losses for financial issues in Tokyo trading Tuesday.
Those concerns were further exacerbated by election results over the weekend in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union was roundly defeated in her home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Germany, as Europe’s largest economy, has played in key role in the formation of the rescue package for debt threatened euro-zone members.
Meanwhile, the yen moved higher against both the euro and the British pound with EUR/JPY down 0.27% to hit 108.08, and GBP/JPY falling 0.28% to hit 123.55.
Investor focus was expected to turn to the release of gross domestic product figures for the euro-zone, as well as the U.S. Institute of Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index due for release later Tuesday."

 SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell and U.S.
Treasury yields dropped to the lowest levels in at least 60
years on Tuesday on fears that Europe's sovereign debt troubles
are worsening and could trigger a second full-blown banking
crisis.	
 The market jitters pushed the euro lower and European stocks
appear set to slide further as S&P 500 futures  
slid 2.7 percent, pointing to sharp losses on Wall Street as it
catches up to European and Asian markets after a holiday on
Monday.	
 Euro STOXX 50 futures  fell 1.3 percent and German
 and French  index futures also dropped, while
spreadbetters called the FTSE 100 1 percent lower.
European stocks tumbled 4 percent on Monday, with financial
shares falling to their lowest in more than two years. 
 ""It's the European disease that is infecting markets all
around the world at the moment,"" said Michael Heffernan, senior
client adviser and strategist at Austock Group in Australia.	
 Adding to the gloom are worries that the United States may
be sliding back into recession, a concern heightened by a slew
of downbeat data, most recently employment figures that showed
the world's top economy failed to create any jobs last month.	
 
 Singapore's finance minister told a conference in the
city-state on Tuesday that a global recession was now ""more
likely than not"" as the U.S. and European economies were at
""stall"" speed. 
 Gold , traditionally seen as a safe asset in times of
uncertainty, rose above $1,919 an ounce to a new record, while
the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds(JGBs), another
safe haven, fell below 1 percent. 
 U.S. Treasuries rose sharply in Asian trading, with the
yield on 10-year notes falling as far as 1.91
percent before stepping back to 1.94 percent, still below 1.99
percent late on Friday. 
 Tokyo's Nikkei fell 2.2 percent to a six-month low,
while MSCI's broadest measure of Asia Pacific shares outside
Japan was off 1.7 percent, putting the index
nearly 19 percent down from its April high. 
 The hardest hit sectors in the MSCI index were industrials,
materials and financials. 
 
 EURO CRISIS	
 The latest focus of Europe's slow-motion debt crisis is
Italy, whose bonds were sold off on Monday on worries that Rome
is not doing enough to bring its debt under control. Italian
10-year yields rose near 5.6 percent, their highest since early
August.	
 While European leaders have been able to put together
bailout packages for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, investors
fear the consequences of a similar crisis engulfing a bigger
economy such as Italy or Spain.	
 The chief executive of Deutsche Bank  said on
Monday that the euro zone sovereign debt crisis would stunt bank
profits for years and could cause the collapse of weaker
lenders. 
 The euro fell to a seven-week low below $1.4055 .
Against the yen, the single currency fell as far as 107.95
, its lowest since March.	
 The European Central Bank, the only major Western central
bank to raise interest rates since the 2008/09 financial crisis,
meets on Thursday but is expected to leave borrowing costs
unchanged at 1.5 percent, which could put the single currency
under further pressure. 
 ""Without the support of a more hawkish central bank, the
euro will look very vulnerable,"" Societe Generale strategists
Kit Juckes and Sebastien Galy wrote in a note.	
 
 STIMULUS HOPES	
 The worsening outlook has piled pressure on the U.S. Federal
Reserve to embark on a third round of money creation via bond
purchases, known as quantitative easing, which could cheapen the
dollar and encourage buying of riskier assets.	
 The next significant data from the United States is the U.S.
ISM non-manufacturing index for August, due later on Tuesday.

 ""If we get a negative reading, it will just reinforce
concerns about a global recession and possibility of some form
of stimulus from the Fed down the road,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an
analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 Global growth in the services sector came to a virtual
standstill last month as new business all but dried up, several
surveys showed on Monday. 
 Hopes of further stimulus from the Fed or President Barack
Obama -- who addresses Congress on his economic plans on
Thursday -- helped Brent crude oil steady after sliding more
than $2 a barrel on Monday on fears renewed recession would hit
demand. 
 Brent  was flat just above $110 a barrel. U.S. crude
 was trading at $83.30 a barrel, down more than $3 from
Friday's close, as there was no settlement on Monday due to the
holiday. 
 JGBs were in demand as investors retreated from riskier
assets, with September 10-year futures up 0.24 point at 143.03,
a 10-month high, while the benchmark 10-year yield fell 2 basis
points to 0.990 percent.

1482,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2011 07:41PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD retreats in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro moved lower against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Tuesday, on persistent fears over Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and the weak performances of European stock markets.
EUR/USD hit 1.4099 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Friday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4068, falling 0.21%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4056, the low of August 4, and resistance at 1.4469, last Monday’s high.
A disappointing jobs report released late last week by the U.S. Labor Department showed that non-farm payrolls remained flat in August, and the unemployment rate  was unchanged at 9.1%. 
Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August.
Earlier Monday, Eurostat reported that retail sales in the euro-zone rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in July, outpacing forecasts of a 0.1% gain.
Separately, market research group Sentix said Monday its index of investor confidence in the euro-zone fell 1.9 points to minus 15.5 in the month of September, down from the August reading of minus 13.5.
On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, below indicates pessimism. Economists had expected the index to fall by 4.5 points to minus 18.0 in September. 
European stocks were off sharply in Monday trade, as the weak U.S. labor numbers added to nervousness about prospects for global economic growth.
France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.73% to 2,999.54, Britain’s FTSE 100 slumped 3.58% to 5,102.58, and Germany’s DAX plummeted by 5.28% to end the session at 5,246.18.
The U.S. market was closed for the Labor Day Holiday.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union was roundly defeated in her home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, setting the stage for a new round of debate on Germany’s role in expanding the powers of the European Financial Stability Facility.  
Specific details, including the extent of member participation and a final total, have yet to be determined for the bailout fund for debt-threatened euro nations.
Meanwhile, the euro was lower against the British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP down by 0.06% to hit 0.8738, and EUR/JPY falling 0.16% to hit 108.20.

 * Euro at 1-mth low vs dollar, USD index hits 1-mth high
 * Greek, Italian fiscal issues weigh on single currency
 * Euro faces downside risk on German legal vote, ECB mtg

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday,
hitting a one-month low versus the dollar as worries about Greek
and Italian public finances and a regional election rout for
Germany's ruling party added to concerns about the euro zone
debt crisis. 
 The single currency fell to $1.4065 on trading platform EBS,
its weakest since Aug. 5. Traders said option-related bids at
$1.4100 had given way and stops were triggered through $1.4080
as a U.S. public holiday made for thinner trading conditions.	
 A jump in yields on Italian government bonds to near
one-month highs weighed on the euro as pressure mounted on Italy
-- the euro zone's third-largest economy -- to get its fiscal
house in order. 
 The higher-yielding Australian and New Zealand dollars fell
1 percent against the dollar as Friday's soft U.S. employment
data fuelled concerns that the U.S. economy may be sliding back
into recession.	
 The suspension of an EU/IMF mission to Greece last week
raised questions over whether Athens can cut its budget deficit
enough to secure another tranche of bailout funds, while Italy's
inability so far to meet its budget commitments continued to
hurt its sovereign bond market. 
 Downside risks to the euro increased after a big fall in
support for Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats in a regional
vote in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday highlighted the German
chancellor's waning popularity and many Germans' dissatisfaction
with having to contribute to euro zone bailouts. 
 ""For the euro the downside is still the dominant driver as
all the commentary is negative, but as yet there isn't enough of
a catalyst in the news flow to take it out of its range against
the dollar and below $1.4000,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency
strategist at UBS.	
 Technical analysts said the clean break below the 61.8
percent retracement of the euro's July-August rally at $1.4110
would add to the negative picture, while the 200-day moving
average would provide key support around $1.4010. 
 The euro's losses pushed the low-yielding dollar to
75.223 versus a currency basket, its highest since early August.	
 The single currency fell more than 1 percent to
1.1021 Swiss francs as economic concerns in the euro zone along
with evidence of a continued slowdown in the U.S. economy
boosted demand for safe-haven assets.	
 The franc's broad gains in the past week or so have raised
expectations the Swiss central bank may have to initiate more
measures to weaken the currency with traders on edge for any
renewed intervention in franc forward markets.

 MORE EURO RISKS	
 The euro faces a week packed with event risk. Implied
options volatility for the euro rose to two-week highs,
reflecting growing nervousness over a further fall in spot.

 Germany's constitutional court will rule on Wednesday on
suits claiming Berlin is breaking German law and European
treaties by contributing to multi-billion euro bailouts of
Greece, Ireland and Portugal. 
 Markets will also focus on a slew of policy announcements by
major central banks, given strong indications the global
economic recovery is stuttering. 
 Analysts said the euro would face more selling if the
European Central Bank, which will make a policy announcement on
Thursday, indicates increasing concern that a deepening debt
crisis is raising overall risks to the euro zone.	
 ""The biggest downside risk for the euro is for a more dovish
statement from the ECB, highlighting the impact of negative
developments of late and potentially suggesting that the
slowdown that we've been seeing is here to stay,"" said Valentin
Marinov, currency strategist at Citi.	
 ""This would open the door to speculation for (early) rate
cuts, and that's not what the market is expecting,"" he said,
adding that this could trigger a test of $1.40 in euro/dollar.	
 Investors also awaited plans from U.S. President Barack
Obama, due on Thursday, to kick-start job creation.	
 Aggressive measures would be seen as positive for the global
growth outlook, but many in the market say there is little
appetite for high spending given that U.S. finances are in
disarray.

 By Naomi Tajitsu	
 LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday,
touching a three-week trough versus the dollar as worries about
Greek and Italian fiscal deficits and a regional election rout
for Germany's ruling party cast more doubt on the euro zone's
ability to solve its debt crisis.	
 The single currency fell to $1.4113, its weakest
since mid-August, also pressured by a 2 percent slide in
European shares in early trade .	
 While euro sentiment remains firmly negative, traders cited
sovereign demand in the $1.4110-1.4100 region, which limited
selling in the near term, while technical support at $1.4110 was
also seen.	
 Other currencies perceived to be higher risk, including the
Australian and New Zealand dollars, also took a hit against the
dollar, while the greenback hit a one-month high versus a
currency basket.	
 The suspension of an EU/IMF mission to Greece late last week
has cast doubts on whether Greece can cut its budget deficit
enough to secure another tranche of bailout funds, while Italy's
inability so far to meet its budget commitments continues to
hammer its sovereign bond market. 
 Analysts see more downside risks to the euro after a big
fall in support for Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats in a
regional vote in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday highlighted
the German chancellor's waning popularity as Europe's top
economy bears the brunt of assisting its heavily indebted
neighbours. 
 ""The pressure will be for the euro to move lower given the
newsflow, but every time we move down to these levels we see
(sovereign) rebalancing flows come in,"" said Richard Falkenhall,
currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.	
 ""So whether we will see a break below $1.41 is hard to say.""	
 Asian sovereign buying in euros helped to lift the single
currency from its lows. This prevented a fall to $1.4110, a
support level given that it is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the euro's July-August rally.	
 Traders cited sell offers from $1.4180 through $1.42, while
some large banks were interested in selling above that.	
 ""We still favour playing it from the short side and would
see $1.4210 and $1.4250 as selling opportunities,"" CitiFX Wire
said in a note.	
 The euro's losses versus the dollar pushed the dollar
to 75.074 versus a currency basket, its highest since early
August. The basket is weighted mainly in euros, making it
sensitive to fluctuations in that currency.	
 The dollar was flat on the day at 76.82 yen.	
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars
each fell around 1.0 percent versus their U.S. counterpart.
Those commodity-linked currencies are considered higher risk due
to their higher yields and their dependence on growth in the
global economy. 
 The single currency fell 0.5 percent to 1.1135
Swiss francs, as the ongoing economic concerns in the euro zone
along with evidence of a continued slowdown in the U.S. economy
raised demand for the safe-haven currency.	
 The franc's broad gains in the past week or so have raised
expectations the Swiss central bank may have to initiate more
measures to weaken the currency. 
 
 MORE EURO RISKS	
 The euro faces a week packed with more potential event risk,
both political and legal, beginning with a German Federal
Constitutional court ruling on Wednesday on suits claiming
Berlin is breaking German law and European treaties by
contributing to multi-billion euro bailouts of Greece, Ireland
and Portugal. 
 A slew of policy announcements by major central banks also
be in focus, given strong indications the global economic
recovery is stuttering. will 
 This was highlighted by U.S. data late last week showing
employment growth in the world's largest economy ground to a
halt in August. 
 There is growing speculation over whether the ECB would
continue purchasing Italian debt, a strategy that has caused
sharp divisions within the Frankfurt-based central bank ahead of
a policy meeting on Thursday.

 * Wall Street closed for holiday

 By Natsuko Waki and Jeremy Gaunt	
 LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters)- European stocks tumbled 4 percent
on Monday, with banks plumbing a more than two year low, as
fears for the future of the euro zone bubbled up against a
background of weak economic growth and threats to the banking
sector.	
 The euro fell across the board, with peripheral euro zone
debt concerns and political uncertainty in Germany prompting
rises in both the dollar and safe-haven Swiss franc.	
 Worries about public deficits in Greece and Italy and a
regional election rout for Germany's ruling party cast fresh
doubt on the euro zone's ability to tackle its debt crisis.	
 Wall Street was closed for a holiday but it was unlikely
that U.S. investors would have been in any more of a positive
mood given data ahead of the long weekend that showed U.S.
employment growth halted in August.	
 That fuelled concerns that the world's biggest economy is
slipping back into recession. 
 It prompted oil to sell off on Monday, with benchmark Brent
dropping below $110 a barrel.	
 The euro zone, meanwhile, faces a week packed with political
and legal risks, beginning with a German constitutional court
ruling on Wednesday on claims that Berlin is breaking German law
and European treaties by contributing to bailouts for Greece,
Ireland and Portugal. 
 The court is not expected to rule against the contributions,
but may add stipulations for dealing with future requests that
will complicate the region's bailout plans. 
 ""People are pricing in the risk of European meltdown, rather
than the likely outcome,"" said Ian King, head of international
equities at Legal & General.	
 Banks in Europe were also under the cosh because of
uncertainty about what a U.S. lawsuit connected to the packaging
of toxic mortgage debt might mean.	
 ""Not a great start to the week. There is a lot going on for
banks, especially in the light of a low-growth environment and
the backdrop in the euro zone not improving,"" said Mike Lenhoff,
chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin. 
 The MSCI all country world equity index was
down 2.0 percent on the day, helped along by Japan's Nikkei
losing 1.9 percent in a catchup from Friday's U.S. jobs
data.	
 European stocks closed down 4.06 percent, with the
banking sector shedding nearly 6 percent to a 29-month
low.	
 ""There is massive tailrisk in the system right now,"" said
Andrew Lim, banks equity analyst at Espirito Santo.	
 
BATTERED EURO	
The dollar rose half a percent to a one-month high
against a basket of major currencies.	
The euro fell across the board, hitting a three-week low of
$1.4111 and dipping 1 percent against the safe-haven
Swiss franc. 
 As many European financial institutions are saddled with
losses on bond holdings, traders are also worried that their
funding could face more strains, putting pressure on the single
currency. 
 The yield premiums investors demand to hold Italian and
Spanish 10-year government bonds rather than benchmark German
Bunds hit their highest levels in a month.	
 As pressure mounted on Italy -- the euro zone's
third-largest economy -- to get its fiscal house in order,
Italian 10-year yields rose close to 5.6 percent,
their highest since early August.	
 Recent buying by the European Central Bank had pushed them
down to the 5 percent level. 
 Besides the German court ruling, a meeting of finance
ministers of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland will be
closely eyed as they discuss the nagging issue of collateral for
loans to Greece. 
 Debate over the effectiveness of ECB bond-buying is likely
intensify at the bank's monthly policy meeting on Thursday.	
 ""We will probably get the ... assertion that 'all euro zone
countries must stick to their fiscal plans as agreed with the
euro zone authorities',"" Richard McGuire, rate strategist at
Rabobank, said.	
 ""Singling out Italy -- there is a risk that that would be
counterproductive because it would put Italian yields under
significant pressure and therefore undo much of the work that
the ECB has done.""

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - European shares were set for
sharp losses on Monday after Asian stocks slid and the euro hit
a three-week low against the dollar, as fears of a renewed U.S.
recession and sustained worries about the euro zone debt crisis
prompted investors to sell riskier assets.	
 U.S. employment data on Friday showed the world's biggest
economy failed to create any jobs last month for the first time
in nearly a year. 
 ""Even if you take out the effect from the Verizon strike, it
is still a lousy number and people are concerned that growth is
not there any more,"" said Dominic Schnider, head of commodity
research of UBS Wealth Management in Singapore. 
 Europe, meanwhile, faces a string of political and legal
tests this week that could hurt efforts to resolve its sovereign
debt crisis and increase pressure on governments to try more
radical solutions. .	
 ""In this atmosphere, foreign investors are likely to remain
risk-averse and inactive,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund
manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co in Tokyo.	
 Euro STOXX 50 futures  fell 1.9 percent, while index
futures for Germany's DAX  and France's CAC-40 
were down the same amount. Financial bookmakers called the FTSE
100 to open down 1.3 percent. 
 
 Demand for safer assets drove up Japanese government bonds,
while the yen firmed a touch and gold lost only a little ground
after spiking on Friday.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei share average fell 1.9 percent, while
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 3 percent, leaving it nearly 18 percent
below its April high. 
 Energy and materials, both sensitive to expectations of
industrial demand, and technology, affected by Western demand
for Asian electronics, were the hardest hit sectors in the MSCI
index, shedding between 3.5 and 4.5 percent.	
 
 OBAMA SPEECH	
 Stocks on Wall Street and other major exchanges
closed down more than 2 percent on Friday after the U.S. Labor
Department report, which also sparked a rally in safe haven
investments such as gold, Treasuries and the Swiss franc.

 U.S. S&P stock futures  fell 0.7 percent in Asia,
extending Friday's weakness, although Wall Street is closed on
Monday for the Labor Day holiday.	
 Investors are looking ahead to a speech to Congress by
President Barack Obama on Thursday for details on how he plans
to boost the economy.	
 ""Some don't expect much in the way of concrete measures from
Obama. There won't be any magic rebound,"" said Fumiyuki
Nakanishi, strategist at SMBC Friend Securities in Tokyo.	
 The worsening outlook also piles pressure on the U.S.
Federal Reserve to embark on a third round of money creation via
bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, which could
cheapen the dollar and encourage buying of riskier assets.	
 A year ago a signal from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that a
second bout of quantitative easing, dubbed QE2, was in the
pipeline triggered a rally that saw the S&P 500 rise about 30
percent from August to May.	
 This time, however, some analysts are doubtful that any
""QE3"" programme would have a similar effect and the central bank
itself appears more reluctant.	
 ""This is likely to bring further calls for quantitative
easing, despite the Fed's apparent aversion,"" said CMC Markets
market strategist Michael McCarthy in a research note. 
 
 EURO WOE	
 In currency markets, the euro hit its lowest level in
three weeks against the dollar while currencies affected by
expected demand for commodities, such as the Australian dollar,
also came under pressure.	
 A court ruling in Germany on Wednesday may limit the ability
of the euro zone's biggest economy to finance rescues of
crisis-hit countries such as Greece.	
 There is also speculation over whether the European Central
Bank will continue purchasing Italian debt, a policy that has
caused sharp divisions within the central bank's governing
council, ahead of its next policy meeting on Thursday.	
 ""Countries that need help are getting tired of reforms.
Countries that are paying money are getting tired of helping,""
said Kimihiko Tomita, manager of forex at State Street.	
 ""The outlook of the euro zone bailout scheme is becoming a
bit shaky."" 
 The euro fell to around $1.4150 , having dropped as
far as $1.41367, its lowest since Aug. 11. That helped drive the
dollar index back to one-month highs.	
 The yen firmed slightly to around 76.70 per dollar.

 Japanese government bond September 10-year futures
rose 0.50 point to 142.79, while the benchmark 10-year yield
fell 4.5 basis points to 1.015 percent. 
 Gold held most of its gains, inching down around 0.3
percent to about $1,879 an ounce after jumping more than 3
percent on Friday. 
 Oil eased on concerns that a ""double-dip"" U.S. recession
would slow demand, with Brent crude  falling 0.8 percent
to $111.45 a barrel while U.S. crude  eased around 1.1
percent to $85.52 a barrel.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Paralysis in the U.S. jobs
market reinforced fears of recession on Friday, driving
investors out of stocks and into the safety of bonds, gold and
the Swiss franc.
 Stocks on Wall Street and other major exchanges closed down
more than 2 percent after the U.S. Labor Department said
employers added no net new jobs last month and July's total was
revised lower. For details, see [ID:nOAT004865]
 The biggest reaction came in the U.S. Treasuries market,
where the yield on the 30-year bond hit two-and-a-half-year
lows on growing bets the dismal data will compel the Federal
Reserve to take additional steps to boost the economy.
 After a treacherous August of out-sized market volatility,
the jobs report fed worries that September could bring more of
the same, especially if economic data rekindles fear of another
recession.
 ""There are a lot of confidence issues in the marketplace;
the jobs number only made things worse,"" said Sal Arnuk,
co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
""My only question is 'Why the market isn't down more?'"" 
 U.S. equities suffered their biggest drop in two weeks.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 253.31
points, or 2.20 percent, at 11,240.26. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 30.45 points, or 2.53 percent, at
1,173.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 66.71

 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2.3
percent while European stocks <.FTEU3> slid 2.5 percent.
Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> dropped by 1.6 percent.
 President Barack Obama, in a speech set for Sept. 8, will
unveil a jobs program he hopes will provide ""meaningful"" tax
relief and help the nation's long-term unemployed, a top aide
told Reuters Insider. [ID:nWNA7806] [ID:nRTV258655]
 Some think stocks will suffer from anemic jobs growth, at

wakes up and realizes what the restraints are and designs a
program attacking restraints, it's not going to make much
progress,"" said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A.
Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were up 35/32
in price, with the yield at 1.9961 percent, down more than 8
basis points on the day.
 The 10-year yield is within striking distance of 1.976
percent, an intraday low set in mid-August, according to
Tradeweb, and a level not seen in at least 60 years.
 In Treasury Inflation Protected Securities trading, the
yield on 10-year TIPS  touched minus 0.02
percent, down 7 basis points from late Thursday. This signaled
that traders have slashed their expectations for long-term U.S.
economic growth and inflation.
 There is now a growing expectation the Federal Open Market
Committee will extend the maturity of its $1.65 trillion
Treasuries holdings at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting.
 The intended effect would be to push rates lower throughout
the economy in an attempt to ignite consumer demand.
 ""This (jobs) report will certainly strengthen the case for
the doves on the committee going into the next meeting later
this month,"" said Millan Mulraine, senior U.S. macro strategist
with TD Securities in New York.
 In a research note, Goldman Sachs economists said they
expect the Fed will announce plans to lengthen the average
maturity of its portfolio, ""with sales of relatively
short-dated Treasuries and purchases of relatively long-dated
Treasuries.""
 The 30-year Treasury bond  soared more than
three points in price. Yields dropped to 3.32 percent, the
lowest since Jan. 2009.
 Bund futures  rose 1.2 percent, hitting a record
high on safe-haven demand.
 In currency trading, the Swiss franc  was up nearly 1
percent at 0.7898 to the dollar after hitting session highs at
0.7959.
 The euro  was near $1.419, having hit a three-week
low of $1.418 earlier on confirmation that Greece will miss its
2011 deficit target of 7.6 percent and uncertainty over Italy's
commitment to austerity measures. [FRX/]

just shy of $1,877 an ounce after peaking at $1,885 during the
session. [GOL/]

“The number of unemployed persons, at 14 million, was essentially unchanged in August...Employment in most major industries changed little over the month,” the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its report.
The White House’s Office of Management and Budget, on Thursday, forecast that unemployment would average 8.8% this year, down from an earlier estimate of 9.3%.
The office added that the federal budget deficit would fall to USD1.32 trillion in 2011, down from the USD1.64 trillion estimated in the 2012 fiscal budget.
Wall Street investors took a dim view of the labor numbers as U.S. stocks were on track to post their second consecutive day of losses.

 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The dollar is likely to trend
lower in the week ahead after another abysmal U.S. jobs report
on Friday, which investors perceive as raising the likelihood
of further action by the Federal Reserve to aid the economy.
 With the benchmark U.S. interest rate already close to
zero, the Fed is limited in the actions it can take.
 Two rounds of quantitative easing costing $2.3 trillion,
where the U.S. central bank bought government securities for
its own balance sheet, simultaneously increasing liquidity in
the economy, has failed to increase economic growth.
 Yet market expectations are rising that the Fed will embark
on a third round of similar action. But raising the supply of
dollars lowers its value.
 ""With the labor market now at 'stall speed,' the data is
likely to keep alive expectations for Fed policy easing at the
September meeting,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency
strategist at Wells Fargo Bank.
 The euro shed 2.18 percent against the dollar this week,
according to electronic trading platform EBS , its
worst week since the week ended July 10, while the dollar was
little changed against the yen .
 The euro is now up 6.1 percent against the dollar in the
year to date, while the dollar is down 5.5 percent against the
yen so far in 2011.
 Speaking last week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bernanke said
the Fed had marked down its outlook for the U.S. economy and
that the Fed would extend its September meeting to two days
from one to consider its options.
 ""With the Nonfarm Payroll number coming in at zero, and the
prior revised 32,000 lower, the Fed has gained greater
political ability to enact a version of QE3 at their meeting in
September,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director of Faros
Trading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""We see this as terrifically
bearish for the U.S. dollar.""
 U.S. President Barack Obama will address a joint session of
Congress, televised to the the nation, next Thursday on ways to
increase job creation and accelerate economic growth. For

 INTERVENTION
 Investors will also be keeping a close eye on three central
banks.
 With the yen and Swiss franc again approaching record lows
on purchases by investors who are shunning risk, expectations
are high for intervention by the Bank of Japan and the Swiss
National Bank to stem the strength of their respective
currencies, which would aid the dollar.
 Both banks have recently taken action in the currency
markets. While investors are ready to test their resolve by
buying each currency, they are equally ready to pull the
trigger and sell rather than stand in the way of unilateral
action.
 The central banks of developed economies also have deeper
pockets compared with even the wealthiest investors.
 The euro fell 4.6 percent against the Swiss franc
 this week, while the dollar slipped 2.6 percent
against the franc .
 Some of the euro's declines on the week against the dollar
can be traced to euro selling against the Swiss franc.
 ""The risk of intervention by the Bank of Japan and the
Swiss National Bank will limit gains in these currencies,"" said
John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential
International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey.
 Top Swiss politicians came out on Friday in support of
steps the Swiss National Bank has taken to limit the rally of
the record-strong Swiss franc, potentially strengthening the
central bank's resolve to consider currency interventions.
[ID:nWEA2973]
 Adding to investors risk in betting against the dollar is a
meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday.
 The ECB has been more hawkish than the Fed, even against a
backdrop of sovereign debt concerns centered on Greece and
other peripheral euro zone nations. But with euro zone growth
seen at risk, that may change.
 ""The general expectation is they will change their tone and
indicate they will pause with no rate increases in the near
term,"" said Praveen.
 That could raise the relative attractiveness of the dollar
against the euro, though given the meeting is ahead of Obama's
speech to Congress and the concern about job growth, it may
have only limited impact.
 U.S. financial markets will be closed on Monday for the
Labor Day holiday, the traditional end to the U.S. summer.

(Updates with market moves)
 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Unexpectedly weak U.S. job
numbers for August on Friday reinforced fears of recession,
driving investors out of stocks and into the safety of bonds,
gold and the Swiss franc.
 World stocks fell nearly 2 percent after the U.S. Labor
Department said employers added no new jobs in August and
July's figure was revised lower. For more see [ID:nOAT004865].
 The biggest reaction came in the U.S. Treasuries market,
where the yield on the 30-year bond hit two-and-a-half-year
lows on growing bets the dismal data will compel the Federal
Reserve to take additional steps to boost the economy.
 After a treacherous August of out-sized market volatility,
the jobs report feeds worries that September could bring more
of the same, especially if economic data rekindles fears of
another recession.
 ""There are a lot of confidence issues in the marketplace;
the jobs number only made things worse,"" said Sal Arnuk,
co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New
Jersey.
 There is now a growing expectation the Federal Open Market
Committee will extend the maturity of its $1.65 trillion
Treasuries holdings at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting. [US/]
The intended effect would be to push rates lower throughout the
economy in an attempt to ignite consumer demand.
 In a note, Goldman Sachs economists said they expect the
Fed will announce plans to lengthen the average maturity of its
portfolio, ""with sales of relatively short-dated Treasuries and
purchases of relatively long-dated Treasuries.""
 Gold futures  surged 2.8 percent to nearly $1,880 an
ounce. [GOL/]
 The 30-year bond  soared three points in price,
briefly bringing its yield to its lowest level since February
2009.

 ""This (jobs) report will certainly strengthen the case for

 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Stunningly weak U.S. job
numbers for August reinforced fears of recession on Friday,
driving investors into safe havens for a second straight day
and pushing bonds, the Swiss franc and gold higher.
 Stocks on Wall Street slumped after the U.S. Labor
Department said employers added no new jobs in August, compared

 * Swiss franc soars as equity markets under pressure
 * SNB absent from forward market but traders wary
 * Focus on U.S. jobs report and QE3 speculation

 By Nia Williams and Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc extended this
week's impressive gains on Friday as concerns about the euro
zone debt crisis and a gloomy economic outlook prompted fund
investors to seek the safe-haven franc and test the Swiss
National Bank's resolve.	
 There was no sign of the SNB in the Swiss forward market to
reinject liquidity and stem strength in the currency, whose
stellar performance is a problem for its exporters, although
traders remained on alert for more measures.	
 U.S. employment data at 1230 GMT will be the focus for
investors concerned about a global economic slowdown, with a
lower-than-expected number likely to increase safe haven bids.	
 The euro fell more than 2 percent against the franc to a
session low of 1.1060 francs , extending a rapid dive
from nearly 1.2000 francs on Monday. That put the single
currency on course for its biggest ever weekly fall.	
 The dollar also dropped 2 percent to 0.7760 francs ,
with traders citing selling by a large European bank. Support is
now seen around 0.7663, the 50 percent retracement of the Aug.
9-29 rise from an all-time low of 0.7068 francs.	
 SNB injections of liquidity last month pushed Swiss deposit
rates into negative territory, forcing the currency to retreat
from record highs, but analysts said persistent economic
concerns are maintaining interest in it as a safe place to put
funds.	
 ""People are getting used to the fact that negative deposit
rates are not much of a deterrent to the market if the Swiss
franc appreciates sharply,"" said Chris Turner, head of fx
strategy at ING. ""Flows are increasingly a function of safety
and not return.""	
 Traders reported dire liquidity in the spot market and said
Swiss options were starting to become dislocated as this week's
sharp rally in the franc prompted a spike in implied volatility
and speculation the SNB may need to take more action.	
 One-week euro/Swiss vol -- a measure of volatility -- surged
to around 28 percent versus around 20 on Thursday,
while risk-reversals, which marks the premium required to hold a
put or a call in a currency, jumped to around 3.50 in favour of
euro puts , up from 3.10 on Thursday.	
 Markets were broadly in risk-averse mode as stocks fell
sharply, breaking a four-day rally, while euro zone peripheral
bond yields rose. 
 Market players said risk aversion was fuelled by worries
about Greece meeting its deficit targets, concerns over Germany
passing plans to reform the European bailout fund this month and
Italy's backtracking on budget austerity. 
 The euro fell to a three-week low against the dollar
of $1.4208 before recovering to trade flat at $1.4260, after
running into strong option barrier protection ahead of $1.4200.	
 
 U.S. JOBS DATA	
 Non-farm payrolls data will be the last major U.S.
employment report before September's Fed meeting at which
policymakers are increasingly expected to flag some sort of
monetary easing.	
 Unemployment is a key determinant in whether the Fed takes
additional action to support the economy and economists polled
by Reuters were expecting the payrolls data to show an increase
of 75,000 jobs. 
 Analysts said expectations for the jobs data have been
lowered, however, after an employment gauge in a U.S.
manufacturing survey released on Thursday dipped to its lowest
level since November 2009. 
 A poor reading could trigger some safe haven bids for the
dollar, but also add weight to speculation the Fed is gearing up
for another round of monetary stimulus, dubbed QE3, which would
pump liquidity into the market and weaken the greenback.	
 ""We are not expecting a number which is suffice to put the
Fed off moving towards more QE,"" said Clive Dennis, head of
currencies at Schroders which has $60 million in assets under
management in its Global Managed Currency fund.	
 ""The dollar will probably go up in the short term but that
move is likely to turn lower as QE comes back in focus.""	
 The greenback traded down 0.2 percent on the day versus the
yen at 76.73 , while the risk-correlated Australian dollar
slipped 0.2 percent to US$1.0700.	
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, was close to flat at 74.475 ,
hovering near a three-week high of 74.714 hit on Thursday.

 By Natsuko Waki	
 LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro slipped
on Friday while core government bonds rose as concerns about the
euro zone debt crisis resurfaced and investors braced for jobs
data that could signal the U.S. economy is heading for
recession.	
 Confirmation that Greece will miss its 2011 deficit target
of 7.6 percent and uncertainty over Italy's
commitment to austerity measures underscored unease about the
single currency zone, prompting investors to shy away from
riskier assets.	
 The U.S. employment report, due at 1230 GMT, is expected to
show an increase of 75,000 jobs, down from 117,000 in July. 
 ""I think the job figures are going to be worse than
expected. It could be a wake-up call for the market and share
prices could go down even further,"" said Koen De Leus,
strategist at KBC Securities in Brussels. 
 ""Expectations of QE3 (another round of U.S. quantitative
easing) have helped shares in the past days, but at the end of
the day, the market needs a better economic environment that
stimulates growth and company results.""	
 MSCI's world equity index lost 0.7 percent.
It was still on track for a second consecutive weekly gain after
a volatile August that pushed the benchmark index to an 11-month
low at one point.	
 European stocks fell 1.7 percent after rising so
far this week, while emerging stocks dropped 0.7
percent following a five-day rally.	
 U.S. crude oil  was down 0.9 percent at $88.17 a
barrel.	
 Bund futures  rose 54 ticks, supported by weak
demand at this week's Italian and Spanish debt sales and dismal
manufacturing figures on Thursday.	
 Talks between Greece and international inspectors on a new
aid tranche were put on hold, after a senior government official
told Reuters on Thursday that Greece expects its 2011 budget
deficit to reach 8.1 to 8.2 percent of GDP. ID:nL5E7K20W1].	
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet told
Italy's struggling centre-right government to deliver on its
promised austerity package, adding to international pressure on
weakened premier Silvio Berlusconi. 
 ECB support is vital because the bank has been buying
Italian bonds in markets to keep yields low enough for Rome to
continue borrowing without external aid.	
 The euro lost a quarter percent to a three-week low
around $1.4207.	
 ""It's hard for the euro to go down very fast against the
dollar given expectations for more monetary easing in the U.S.
But if we continue to get worst-case scenarios panning out in
the euro zone it will have to go lower,"" said Adrian Schmidt,
currency strategist at Lloyds Banking Group. 
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Ian Chua	
 SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on
Friday after a drubbing overnight on weak euro zone data,
supported by talk that Asian sovereign players were buying the
single currency to defend an option barrier.	
 Some traders said the euro may trend lower in coming days,
given growing worries about the euro zone growth outlook and the
possibility of the European Central Bank softening its hawkish
stance at next week's policy meeting.	
 Data on Thursday showed manufacturing in the euro zone
contracted for the first time in almost two years and a Spanish
bond sale drew lukewarm demand. 
 ""Any hint of an easing bias from the ECB would accelerate
EUR breaking the bottom of the recent range of 1.41-1.45,""
analysts at BNP Paribas said.	
 The euro held steady near $1.4262 , holding
above a three-week low around $1.4227 hit the previous day.	
 Traders in Tokyo said there was some euro-buying to defend
an option barrier at $1.4200. Traders said the barrier is the
downside leg of a double no-touch option with barriers at $1.42
and $1.46, thought to be held by an Asian sovereign player.	
 Boding ill for the euro is its drop below an upward
trendline drawn through its mid-July low and troughs hit in
early August. The trendline now comes in near $1.4295 and may
serve as resistance.	
 In addition, traders said option positions built
up during the last couple of days suggest some players are
positioning for a break to the downside, targeting $1.3850.

 The euro would have to breach a series of support
levels before dropping that far, including its Aug. 12 intraday
low near $1.4150 and its Aug. 5 intraday trough of $1.4055.	
 Lower down, the euro's 200-day moving average offers support
near $1.4005, and an upward trendline drawn off lows hit in June
2010 and January 2011 lies roughly around $1.3930. 
 The Australian dollar dipped as U.S. stock futures 
retreated after the New York Times reported that the agency that
oversees U.S. mortgage markets is preparing to file suit against
""more than a dozen"" big U.S. banks, accusing them of
misrepresenting the quality of mortgages they packaged and sold
during the housing bubble. 
 But the Aussie only fell modestly, dipping 0.2 percent to
$1.0709 , and some traders attributed the dip in U.S.
stock futures to position unwinding ahead of a long U.S.
weekend, with the U.S. Labor Day holiday coming on Monday. 
 
 JOBS DATA	
 The market's focus is on U.S. jobs data due later on Friday,
the last nonfarm payrolls report before a Fed policy meeting
later this month at which many market participants are expecting
some sort of additional easing.	
 Unemployment is a key determinant in whether the Fed takes
additional action to support the economy.	
 Market players say expectations for the jobs data have been
lowered after the employment gauge in a U.S. manufacturing
survey released on Thursday dipped to its lowest level since
November 2009. 
 A strong result could trigger a bigger reaction
than a weak outcome, said Adarsh Sinha, Asia-Pacific G10 FX
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.	
""I think expectations are probably pretty pessimistic going
into payrolls,"" Sinha said. Economists polled by Reuters are
expecting the payrolls data to show an increase of 75,000 jobs.

Sinha, however, said that the market may now be bracing for a
smaller increase of about 40,000 jobs.	
""If it's better than expected, then the market is going to
price out expectations of further easing to some extent... I
would expect that to be a dollar positive scenario,"" he said.	
The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a
basket of currencies, was little changed at 74.515 ,
hovering near a three-week high of 74.714 hit on Thursday. 
 The yen showed little reaction to news that new Japanese
Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda picked Jun Azumi, a former
parliamentary affairs chief for the ruling Democratic Party, to
become the new finance minister. 
 ""I don't think there will be any major changes to Japan's
yen intervention policy, but there's a bit of uncertainty
because we don't know his personal stance, so it's really hard
to say anything,"" said Koji Fukaya, director of global foreign
exchange research at Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo.	
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 76.85 yen .

In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.06% to hit 1.4268.
The U.S. Institute of Supply Management reported earlier Thursday, that its index of purchasing managers fell to 50.6 in the month of August from 50.9 the month before. That was better than analyst’s forecasts of a retreat to 48.5 for the month but still represented a contraction in activity.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor released data for the week ending August 26, showing that the number of Americans filing for initial job benefits dropped by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 409,000. 
The figure was in line with market expectations but still only marginally above the 400,000 break even point generally found during periods of U.S. labor expansion.
Wall Street shares snapped a five day winning streak following release of the data, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.03%, the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.3%, and the S&P 500 was lower by 1.19%.
Meanwhile, the greenback was down against the British pound, with GBP/USD up by 0.05% to hit 1.6186. 
The dollar was lower against both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY dropping 0.07% to hit 76.88, and USD/CHF down by 0.15% to hit 0.7944.

Toyota U.S. sales slumped by 12.7% in August while Honda sales in the region fell sharply by 24%. 
A persistently strong yen versus the U.S. dollar in addition to lingering production difficulties following the March 11 earthquake both contributed to the falloffs.

to 2 percent while U.S. stock futures  eased 0.4 percent,
with a New York Times report that the agency which oversees U.S.
mortgage markets is preparing to file suit against ""more than a
dozen"" big U.S. banks also hurting sentiment. 
 Trading was light in Asia with investors largely sidelined
before the U.S. nonfarm payroll report, the only jobs data due
before the Federal Reserve holds a two-day meeting at which some
market participants expect some sort of policy easing.	
 While a strong bout of short covering this week has lifted
most equity indices from August lows, the rally has taken place
amid very low volume, indicating that sentiment remains fragile
and markets are still vulnerable to selling pressure.	
 On Friday, stocks dipped in Asia as investors cut exposure
to risky assets, but the region's shares still managed to score
a solid weekly gain of about 4 percent, the best weekly
performance since March.	
 The influential U.S. non-farm payrolls data is expected to
show an increase of 75,000 jobs, although market whispers are
for a much lower number. The data is due at 1230 GMT. 
 A decline in the employment component of the Institute for
Supply Management's (ISM) factory activity index on Thursday
heightened worries that August U.S. jobs growth will be weaker
than feared. ISM's factory activity index came in only just
above the level that indicates growth. 
 Ironically though, a better-than-expected non-farm payrolls
number could lead to a ""risk-off"" market reaction because that
will be interpreted as making it less likely the Fed will launch
a fresh round of easing at this month's policy meeting, BNP
Paribas strategists said in a daily note.	
 Expectations of more stimulus have risen after Chairman Ben
Bernanke said the Fed will meet for two days this month even
though he steered clear of mentioning any fresh round of
stimulus for the ailing economy at a speech last month.

 Japan's Nikkei ended 1.2 percent down after rising
for six days while Australia fell by 1.5 percent.	
 ""Global economic worries are the main focus and volume has
been relatively low recently. At times like this, both buying
and selling can be risky, so this is keeping stocks trapped in
their recent ranges,"" said Yutaka Miura, senior technical
analyst at Mizuho Securities. 
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index
weakened 0.9 percent after rising by more than five percent this
week. For the year, it is still down nearly 9 percent mainly due
to a sharp drop in August.	
 
 EURO WEAKENS	
 In currency markets, the Swiss franc remained the
currency of choice as slowing factory output from the United
States to China prompted market players to cut exposure to risky
assets.	
 The U.S. dollar slipped to 0.7922 francs ,
well off highs around 0.8239 at the start of the week. 
 The euro languished near a three-week low of around $1.4224
hit on Thursday as lukewarm demand at a Spanish bond sale and
weak euro zone PMI data reminded investors that the region's
troubles are far from over. 
 Traders expect the common currency to trend lower in coming
days on growing worries about the euro zone growth outlook and
the possibility of the European Central Bank softening its
hawkish stance at next week's policy meeting. 
 Gold was steady around the 1,825 per ounce line with
investors reluctant to take positions before the data.	
 Oil  edged lower to below $89 a barrel on broader
economic concerns though worries of supply cuts due to impending
storms supported prices.

1575,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 01, 2011 07:40PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD advances in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Friday, following data showing a smaller than expected contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector.
EUR/USD hit 1.4256 in early Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since August 19; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4267, rising 0.01%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4151, the low of August 12, and resistance at 1.4549, Monday’s high.
 Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Institute of Supply Management reported that its index of purchasing managers fell to 50.6 in the month of August from 50.9 the month before.
Economists had forecast the ISM index of purchasing managers, to retreat to 48.5 in August. 
The ISM index of manufacturing prices dropped to 55.5 in August from 59.0 in July, still signifying contraction but at a slower rate than the market expectation of a fall to 55.0 for the last month.
The ISM index of purchasing managers reflects the amount of U.S. manufacturing activity that took place in the previous month, while the index of manufacturing prices represents business sentiment towards future inflation.
“The overall sentiment is one of concern and caution over the domestic and international economic environment, which is affecting customers' confidence and willingness to place orders, at least in the short term,” said Bradley J. Holcomb, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee after release of the data.
U.S. stocks broke a five day winning streak, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.03% to close the day at 11,493.60, the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.3% to 2,546.04, and the S&P 500 was lower by 1.19% to finish at 1,204.42.
Meanwhile in a separate report from European market research group, Markit Economics, the manufacturing purchasing manager’s index for the euro-zone fell to 49.0 in August, below market expectations of retention of the previous month’s figure of 49.7.
European markets closed mixed in Thursday trade, with France’s CAC 40 climbing 0.28% to 3,265.83, Britain’s FTSE 100 up by 0.45% to 5,418.65, and Germany’s DAX lower by 0.94% to end the session at 5,730.63.
Meanwhile, the euro was higher against the British pound but down against the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP up by 0.01% to hit 0.8813, and EUR/JPY falling 0.06% to hit 109.61.
Market players were expected to focus on the release of data on U.S. non-farm payrolls as well as the most recent unemployment numbers, due out later Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

 By Herbert Lash and Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Government debt and the Swiss
franc gained on Thursday after slowing factory output around
the world renewed worries that the global economy is on the
brink of recession, sparking a rally in safe-haven assets.
 Stocks on Wall Street and in Europe initially rose after
data on U.S. factory activity in August unexpectedly showed
expansion, though it was hardly robust. But Wall Street later
fell 1 percent in light volume, with investors mostly biding
their time ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs data for August. [.N]
 Adding to concerns of a deteriorating labor market, Goldman
Sachs said in a note to clients that its economists cut their
forecast for a gain in nonfarm payrolls to 25,000 from 50,000.

dismal payrolls report on Friday and bets the Federal Reserve
will introduce more stimulus to avert a new recession.

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  jumped
28/32 in price to yield 2.14 percent. In Europe, 10-year yields
on German bunds  fell to 2.12 percent, within 10
basis points of the record lows they hit last month.
 There was little sign that investor demand for debt and
other safe-havens was slowing.

more stimulus from the Fed,"" Kathy Lien, director of research
at GFT Forex in New York, said of the data. ""The key is still
job growth.""

 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against major
currencies on Thursday, a day before key U.S. jobs data, as
better-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data did little to ease
concerns about global growth and raise risk tolerance.
 The pace of growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector in
August was better than economists had forecast, but still at
its lowest level in two years. [ID:nN1E7800NC]
 ""We aren't seeing a dollar rally, though, because at the
end of the day, this does not remove the need for more stimulus
from the Fed,"" said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT
Forex in New York. ""The key is still job growth.""
 Data showing contractions in the manufacturing sectors of
most euro zone countries drove broad euro selling, analysts
said. The weakness extended to Germany, the euro zone's biggest
economy, where manufacturing grew in August at its slowest pace
in almost two years. [ID:nL9E7HO0AG].
 The Swiss franc rallied sharply for the second day, as
investors took comfort in the Swiss National Bank's recent
passive approach to the currency's strength after several weeks
of activity last month.
 ""From Asia to the UK, the numbers signaled a continued loss
of momentum,"" Jessica Hoversen, forex analyst at MF Global in
New York, said of the manufacturing data.
 German new export orders fell at the fastest rate of all
the EU countries surveyed for Markit's Purchasing Managers'
Index.
 ""The euro zone can no longer rely on Germany to sustain the
lackluster recovery,"" she said. ""Beyond the data, the situation
in Europe remains distressing.""
 In mid afternoon New York trade, the euro  was
down 0.6 percent at $1.42821 on electronic trading platform
EBS.
 ""We think the situation in Europe is deteriorating quicker
than the euro reflects,"" Hoversen said.
 The U.S. government's closely watched monthly jobs report
to be released on Friday should dictate currency trading. The
euro is seen as most vulnerable to losses due to signs of
weakness in both the European and global economies and because
the euro zone remains far from a solution to its debt crisis.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Confidence about the euro zone's stability has been shaken
by signs officials are dragging their feet on steps to ease
debt problems in Greece and other countries, creating tensions
in funding markets and raising worries about the health of
financial institutions in the region.
 ""Concerns about Greece's debt burden in general is the main
factor weighing on the euro, and complicating that today has
been the euro zone economic data flow,"" said Stephen Gallo,
head of markets analysis at Schneider FX.
 The Swiss franc rallied across the board, with the euro
last down 2.2 percent at 1.1330 francs  and the
dollar 1.5 percent lower at 0.79354 franc .
 The Swiss National Bank has been quiet since mid-August,
when it flooded the market with francs, cut interest rates to
near zero and intervened in the swap market to bring the franc
down from record highs.
 ""The SNB's sight deposit target of 200 billion francs has
likely been reached by now, and given the silence from the SNB,
investors might now try to test the SNB's resolve,"" said Chris
Walker, currency strategist at UBS.
 The yen stayed under pressure on dollar buying by Japanese
accounts, lifting the U.S. currency 0.2 percent to around
76.796 yen on EBS  and soothing jitters that the Bank
of Japan would embark on another round of intervention to curb
its strength.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Faltering factory activity
around the world sparked a rally in safe-haven investments like
U.S. Treasuries and the Swiss franc on Thursday as investors
became more worried about the global economy falling into
recession.
 Stocks on Wall Street were flat until early afternoon after
a reading on U.S. factory activity in August avoided the
contraction most had expected, though it was hardly robust. But
they subsequently turned lower, with investors mostly biding
their time ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs data for August. [.N]

 The euro took a beating by the Swiss franc and the dollar
as euro zone manufacturing appeared in a particularly poor
state, contracting for the first time in almost two years.
 Given the weak state of the global economy, particularly
the slowdown in the United States, investors are likely to
raise bets on more action by the Federal Reserve when economic
data is poor.
 ""Economic data are still telling you that things are not
improving in the economy,"" said Lee Cohen, head of government
trading at Oppenheimer and Co. in New York.
 ""The markets always want candy from the Fed,"" he added.
 Bonds jumped, with prices on benchmark 10-year U.S.
Treasury notes  up 22/32, with a yield of 2.15
percent.
 The 30-year bond  was up 1-22/32 for a yield of
3.51 percent.
 Among currencies, the Swiss franc surged against the euro.
The euro fell to 1.13201 Swiss francs  on trading
platform EBS and was last down 2.1 percent at 1.13370 francs.
 At 1:45 p.m. EDT (1745 GMT), Wall Street's Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was down 64.52 points, or 0.56
percent, at 11,549.01. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>

rebounded, mostly recovering early losses.

such as telecommunications and pharmaceuticals, which eclipsed
losses in cyclical shares. Peripheral banking shares took a hit
though. The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, rose 0.7 percent,

currency fell to a low of $1.42267 on EBS , off a New
York session peak of $1.43853 after the ISM data. It was last
at $1.42775.
 The dollar's strength could be short-lived if investors
continue betting on another dose of Fed monetary injection to
help jobs growth.
 ""At the end of the day, this does not remove the need for
more stimulus from the Fed. The key is still job growth,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in New York.

 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street seesawed
on Thursday and oil prices extended gains after U.S. factory
activity grew in August, versus market expectations of a drop.
 The dollar bounced against the euro, as the
stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing figures stood in
contrast to less-impressive figures from the euro zone. The
dollar  was more than 1 percent higher against the euro.
 World stocks and European markets slipped or were flat
after recovering early losses on data showing euro zone
manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in almost
two years last month.
 Wall Street opened the session flat and initially slipped
after weekly U.S. jobless claims provided little comfort to
investors rattled by dismal European factory data. But the
market turned after manufacturing index from the Institute for
Supply Management suggested U.S. growth, albeit slow, in
August.
 The ""number was stronger than the market expected and more
importantly it was stronger than the whisper numbers out
there,"" said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in
New York.
 The euro extended its losses against the dollar. The single
currency fell to a low of $1.42297 on trading platform EBS, off
a New York session peak of $1.4315 set immediately after the
ISM data. It was last at $1.4244. [FRX/]
 The government's much-awaited non-farm payrolls data for
August is due on Friday. The Federal Reserve is expected to
focus on the latest manufacturing and jobs data at its policy
meeting later this month.
 Shortly after 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was down 1.82 points, or 0.02
percent, at 11,611.71. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
was down 2.18 points, or 0.18 percent, at 1,216.71. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 1.40 points, or 0.05 percent,
at 2,578.06.
 U.S. crude oil  was rose 0.2 percent, trading at
around $89 per barrel after slipping to as low as $88.21
earlier.
 U.S. Treasuries prices rose as the latest factory data and
claims for jobless benefits stoked fears about a recession. The
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 8/32,
its yield at 2.2058 percent. [US/]
 European stocks pared losses and turned flat in the
afternoon as gains in defensive sectors such as
telecommunications and pharmaceuticals eclipsed losses in
cyclicals, while peripheral banking shares took a hit.
 European shares tracked by the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>,
slipped 0.2 percent, after dropping as much as half a percent

 Global stocks, measured by the MSCI All World Index

 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on
Thursday after a four-day rally and oil prices dipped after a
drop in U.S. jobless claims provided little comfort to
investors rattled by dismal European data.
 Stocks slipped in European trading after euro zone
manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in almost
two years in August.
 A key reading on U.S. manufacturing, due at 10:00 a.m. EDT
(1400 GMT) is also expected to show its first decline since the
end of the recession in the second quarter of 2009. The
Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index is expected
to have dropped to 48.5 in August from 50.9 in July, economists
say.

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The euro eased against the dollar
on Thursday, taking a cue from lower stocks, and could slip
further if fresh evidence emerges that manufacturing output in
the United States shrank after euro zone data showed the sector
contracting.	
 The yen stayed under pressure on dollar buying by Japanese
accounts, lifting the U.S. currency to around 77 yen and
soothing jitters that another round of intervention by Tokyo
authorities may be on the way.	
 The Swiss franc was firm against the euro and the
dollar , although gains were less spectacular than on
Wednesday with investors wary of any intervention by the Swiss
National Bank.	
 The euro was down 0.6 percent at $1.4291, triggering
stops on the break of $1.4350 on selling by some quasi-sovereign
investors. It fell past its 100-day moving average, which comes
in at $1.4364. and the 21-day moving average at $1.4350. 
 It extended losses after data showed German manufacturing
activity grew at its slowest pace in almost two years and
European shares opened lower . 
 The gloomy readings added to evidence that the global
economy was slowing. The U.S. ISM manufacturing index is due
later in the session and analysts expect a reading of 48.5 in
August versus 50.9 in July. , indicating contraction.	
 ""There is a risk of a sub-50 reading in the U.S. ISM
manufacturing index. If that happens cyclical and commodity
linked currencies will underperform,"" said Audrey
Childe-Freeman, EMEA head of currency strategy at JP Morgan
Private Bank.	
 ""The global economy is clearly going through a marked
slow-down in economic activity and the market is trying to
assess whether this will be just a soft patch or whether we are
heading towards a recession.""	
 
 SAFETY PLAYS	
 Growing worries about a recession are likely drive more
investors into the relative safety of currencies such as the
Swiss franc and the yen.	
 The euro fell 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1539
francs , while the dollar was marginally lower on the
day at 0.8057 francs.	
 The franc made hefty gains on Wednesday after a top
government official said Switzerland would have to live with a
strong currency and there was little sign of action from the
Swiss central bank. The SNB has flooded the market with francs,
cut rates to near zero and intervened in the swap market to
bring the franc down from record highs.	
 ""The SNB's sight deposit target of 200 billion francs has
likely been reached by now and, given the silence from the SNB,
investors might now try to test the SNB's resolve,"" said Chris
Walker, currency strategist at UBS.	
 The dollar hit a session high of 77.25 yen in the Asian
session after a British fund, some U.S. accounts and several
Tokyo banks followed a major Japanese bank in buying dollars.
Traders said the large dollar purchases appeared to be a
specific transaction unrelated to fundamentals or particular
positions.	
 ""It could be some sort of unwinding after end-of-the-month
transactions yesterday or inflows from pension funds,"" said a
trader for a Japanese bank.	
 The dollar last traded up 0.3 percent at 76.90 yen.	
 The Aussie pared gains made after Australian retail
sales and capital spending data beat market expectations, with
the negative impact of a rate cut by the Brazilian central bank
still playing out. 
The Aussie was flat at $1.0705, off a one-month peak of
$1.0733. The Brazilian rate cut -- the first in two years -- was
taken by some market players as a further sign of weakness in
the global economy, prompting them to take profits on the
recently outperforming New Zealand dollar. The kiwi fell 0.5
percent to $0.8490 .

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent	
 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Financial markets kicked off
September in a grim mood on Thursday with poor European economic
data prompting a regional sell off that ended a four-day global
winning streak.	
 Wall Street also looked set to open with losses and had eyes
on its own manufacturing data which is expected to show activity
declined for the first time since the recession.	
 Euro zone manufacturing activity contracted for the first
time in almost two years in August, underlining investor
concerns about a deteriorating global growth picture.	
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was
down 0.3 percent, taking the year's losses to 6.4 percent.
Global stocks in August fell more than 7.5 percent, their
biggest monthly decline since May last year.	
 Investors entered the month in one of the most bearish moods
in recent times. Reuters asset allocation polls on Wednesday
showed leading fund companies were holding less than 50 percent
of their mixed-asset portfolios in stocks. 
 Sentiment has been battered over the summer by signs of an
ailing global economy and by the euro zone's inability to
contain its debt crisis.	
 A raft of economic data is due over the next two days --
culminating in the monthly U.S. jobless report on Friday -- that
should give investors guidance as to how far the global economy
has slipped.	
 China saw a modest improvement in factory activity in
August, according to a purchasing managers' survey released on
Thursday, but Europe's data was poor.	
 In a worrying sign for policymakers, the regional slowdown
appeared to be spreading. German factories, which have supported
growth in the bloc for some time, hit the brakes in August and
France's manufacturing sector contracted for the first time
since July 2009.	
 ""The global economy is clearly going through a marked
slow-down in economic activity and the market is trying to
assess whether this will be just a soft patch or whether we are
heading towards a recession,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman, EMEA
head of currency strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was down a half a
percent. It lost 11 percent in August, its biggest monthly
percentage drop since October 2008 after the collapse of
investment bank Lehman Brothers. 
 Japan's Nikkei earlier closed up 1.18 percent.	
 
 EURO WEAKER	
 The euro fell three-quarters of a percent against the
dollar.	
 The yen stayed under pressure on dollar buying by Japanese
accounts, lifting the dollar to around the 77 yen level
and soothing jitters that another round of intervention by Tokyo
authorities may soon be on the way.	
 On bond markets, a weak auction of Spanish debt, added to
Italy's earlier in the week, fuelled gains in German debt. 
""The Spanish auction was average and the French ones looked
pretty average too so that seems to have given us the latest leg
up (with core debt)... equities are off too and the weak PMI's
earlier haven't helped,"" a trader said.

 By Richard Pullin	
 MELBOURNE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to a
one-month high on Thursday, but pared gains late in the session
on signals that European markets would not open firmly up on an
uncertain global growth outlook that led Brazil to unexpectedly
slash interest rates. 
 U.S. stocks futures  were up just 0.15 percent in late
Asian trade, suggesting market caution ahead of the
manufacturing and jobs data which may give clues as to whether
the U.S. Federal Reserve will step in to support the economy. 
 
 Global shares have risen sharply in recent days, rebounding
from heavy losses in August as signs of a weakening economy have
led to speculation the Fed will introduce a new round of
monetary expansion. 
 Asian stocks were buoyed by a series of surveys showing that
China managed modest improvement in factory activity in August
thanks to solid domestic demand, despite a slump in export
activity that has hit many major Asian markets.	
 ""The China PMI data gave some immediate relief to the
market, but the U.S. data, particularly the employment numbers,
are still to come,"" said Yutaka Shiraki, senior equity
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.	
 Brazil shocked investors by cutting its key interest rate to
12 percent from 12.5 percent on Wednesday, citing concern over
the global slowdown as well as weaker growth in Latin America's
largest economy. 
 
 EUROPE SEEN MIXED	
 European shares rose on Wednesday as the pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed up 2.9
percent, but still fell 10.6 percent during August -- its worst
monthly performance since October 2008, just after the Lehman
Brothers collapse. 
 However, major European markets were seen opening mixed,
according to financial spreadbetters, with Britain's FTSE 100
set to open between 8 points down and 2 points up.	
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index was up
0.7 percent in late trade, having been up 1.4 percent early in
the day.	
 In Japan, the Nikkei gained closed up 1.2 percent,
clearing the key 9,000 level for the first time in two weeks,
while South Korea's KOSPI also shed gains late in the
day to be up only 0.1 percent as economic data showing the
country's manufacturing sector shrank in August for the first
time in 10 months. 
 
 CHINA DATA	
 China's official PMI offered some reassurance about the pace
of growth, rising on Thursday to 50.9 in August from a 28-month
low of 50.7 in July and signalling some stabilisation in the
manufacturing sector on solid domestic demand. 
 However, the result was just below expectations and the
sub-index for new export orders dipped to 48.3 from 50.4,
curbing gains in mining stocks.	
 U.S. economic data on Wednesday showed the economy continues
to struggle, and the U.S. Institute for Supply Management's
national manufacturing index was due later on Thursday, followed
by the U.S. Labour Department's employment report on Friday.	
 Fears that the ISM index may fall below 50 have been eased
by a brighter than expected reading of manufacturing activity in
the Chicago area released on Wednesday.	
 Also on Thursday, the White House will release its delayed
midsession budget review, updating projections for the U.S.
economy ahead of a congressional review to lower the deficit by
$1.5 trillion over 10 years. 
 Among currencies, the yen fell across the board after dollar
buying by Japanese accounts lifted it above 77 yen , while
the Australian dollar gained broadly as retail sales and capital
spending data beat expectations,	
 The Swiss franc held on to gains scored the previous day
after a top government official said Switzerland would have to
live with a strong currency, to stand at 0.8065 francs per
dollar .	
 The euro last traded at $1.4373 , off a two-month high
at $1.4550 hit at the start of the week on worries over how the
fragmented currency bloc will deal with its debt crisis.	
 Brent crude rose to a one-month high above $115 after
China's manufacturing rebounded, stoking expectations for growth
in the world's largest energy consumer.	
 But the fall in China's export orders helped push LME copper
down 0.7 percent. Spot gold was little changed at
1,8224.00 an ounce.

 By Antoni Slodkowski and Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The yen fell across the board
after dollar buying by Japanese accounts spurred more
broad-based purchases of the greenback, lifting it above 77 yen
and soothing jitters that another round of intervention
by Tokyo authorities may soon be on the way.	
 The dollar was pushed to a session high of 77.25 yen after a
British fund, some U.S. accounts and several Tokyo banks
followed a major Japan bank that made large dollar purchases in
what appeared to be a specific transaction unrelated to
fundamentals or particular positions, traders said.	
 ""The amounts (of dollars bought) are massive and I don't see
the dollar trimming these gains today. Normally whenever it's
bought the dollar tends to get quickly pushed down, but today is
different,"" said a trader for a Japanese bank.	
 ""It could be some sort of unwinding after end-of-the-month
transactions yesterday or inflows from pension funds,"" said the
trader, with other players citing beginning-of-the-month dollar
demand from importers ahead of local fix.	
 The dollar last traded up 0.4 percent at 77 yen. The move
pushed the yen down against other currencies, with a fall to a
one-month trough versus the Aussie, down 0.5 percent at 82.37
. It also lost 0.6 percent against the euro to 110.57
.	
 The Aussie gained broadly as positive Australian retail
sales and capital spending data beat market expectations,
helping to offset the negative impact of a rate cut by the
Brazilian central bank. 
 The Aussie rose 0.2 percent to $1.0707, up from the day's
low of $1.0660 and at one point hitting a one-month peak of
$1.0723.	
 The rate cut -- the first in two years -- was taken by some
market players as another sign of weakness in the global
economy, prompting them to take profits on the recently
outperforming New Zealand dollar. The Kiwi fell 0.4 percent to
$0.8502 .	
 
 HOLDING ON TO GAINS	
 The Swiss franc on Thursday held on to gains scored the
previous day after a top government official said Switzerland
would have to live with a strong currency.	
 The Swissie stood at 0.8065 francs per dollar , having
risen to 0.7994 on Wednesday and off a five-week low of 0.8223,
in a sharp move that led some traders to think the franc's bear
market since early August may have run its course.	
 The franc, which has been a safe haven for investors worried
about the euro zone's debt crisis, also stood at 1.1585 franc
per euro , off a seven-week low of 1.1971 hit on
Monday.	
 ""Given the franc's strong fundamentals, such as that
Switzerland is running a current account surplus and it is a net
creditor nation, the franc's fall would be unsustainable,"" said
Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase.	
 Speculators cut their bets against the franc after
Switzerland Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said on
Wednesday that the country had to live with a strong franc for
now.	
 ""We'll have to keep living with the strong franc for some
time. It must be a combination of measures that will lead us
into the future,"" he said. 
 The SNB has been conspicuously absent from the currency
forwards market since last week. It did not take any new
measures after making an announcement on three of the last four
Wednesdays in August.	
 ""The latest moves are driven by short-term trading by
speculative accounts and are purely based on their speculation.
Investors are hardly moving and keeping their long positions in
the Swiss franc,"" said a trader at a European bank.	
 The euro nursed overnight losses against the dollar on
persistent worries over how the fragmented currency bloc will
deal with its debt crisis, although support at last week's low
around $1.4320 is seen solid for now as many market players are
looking ahead to U.S. manufacturing and jobs data.	
 It last traded at $1.4373 , off a two-month high at
$1.4550 hit at the start of the week, although traders added
that the currency was essentially playing a well-trodden range,
with Asian sovereign demand offsetting negative news from the
euro zone.	
 Traders are looking at more downside with reports of
stop-loss orders at $1.4350, although bids are seen at support
around $1.4320-30, where the euro bounced strongly last week. It
has support from the 55-day moving average around that level as
well.

1614,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2011 11:06PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar gains in mid-day Asian trade,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was mixed against its major counterparts in Asian trade Thursday, on the back of encouraging factory order data and the overnight gain for Wall Street issues.
In mid-day Asian trade, the greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.02% to hit 1.4369.
The U.S. Census Bureau on Wednesday reported that factory orders jumped 2.4% in July, far exceeding economist’s forecasts of a 1% increase. That followed a 0.4% decline in June.
A separate report from payroll processing firm ADP revealed that non-farm private employment in the U.S. rose less than expected to a seasonally adjusted 91,000 in August.
The August figure follows a 109,000 gain in July and fell short of market expectations of an increase to 103,000. 
Shares on Wall Street rallied for the fourth straight day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 0.46%, the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.13%, and the S&P 500 was lifted 0.49%.
The poor labor numbers came at the heels of the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s August policy meeting, where some members favored the introduction of further action to boost the economy, including the purchasing of additional government debt.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said that the central bank should consider additional stimulus measures unless the U.S. economy shows significant improvement.
Evans added that the Federal Reserve’s bond buying measures “need to stay in place until unemployment drops below 7% or inflation gets past 3%.”
Meanwhile, the greenback was up against the British pound, with GBP/USD down by 0.06% to 1.6236. 
The dollar was higher against both the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc with USD/JPY rising 0.38% to hit 76.96, and USD/CHF up by 0.18% to hit 0.8073. 
The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts with USD/CAD down 0.04% to hit 0.9771, AUD/USD lower by 0.05% to hit 1.0705, and NZD/USD falling 0.41% to hit 0.8506.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.04% at 74.24.
Weekly initial jobless claims data from the U.S. Department of Labor, as well as the Institute of Supply Management’s Manufacturing Index were due out later Thursday.

In mid-day Asian trade USD/JPY hit 76.43, the pair’s lowest since last Wednesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 77.13, advancing 0.59%.  
The pair was likely to find support at 76.43, the day’s low, and resistance at 77.70, last Thursday’s high.
The U.S. Census Bureau on Wednesday reported that factory orders jumped 2.4% in July, far exceeding economist’s forecasts of a 1% increase. That followed a 0.4% decline in June.

The August figure follows a 109,000 gain in July and fell short of market expectations of an increase to 103,000. 
Shares on Wall Street posted gains for the fourth straight day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 0.46%, the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.13%, and the S&P 500 was lifted 0.49%.
Earlier, Japan’s industrial production showed a 0.6% rise in July, from 3.8% in the previous month. Expectations were for a 1.6% gain in July.

 By Richard Pullin	
 MELBOURNE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday
following gains on Wall Street, with technology and consumer
shares outperforming, and credit spreads tightened on optimism
central banks around the world will have to do more to support
industrial activity.	
 Slumping exports slowed factory activity in some of Asia's
biggest economies in August, although China managed modest
improvement thanks to solid domestic demand, a series of surveys
released on Thursday showed.	
 Brazil shocked investors by slashing its key interest rate
to 12 percent from 12.5 percent on Wednesday citing concern over
the mounting global slowdown as well as weaker growth in Latin
America's largest economy. 
 But investors cautioned that gains would likely be limited
ahead of key U.S. manufacturing and jobs data due later this
week. Signs of a weakening economy have led to speculation the
Fed will step in with a new round of monetary expansion.

""The China PMI data gave some immediate relief to the market,
but the U.S. data, particularly the employment numbers, are
still to come,"" said Yutaka Shiraki, senior equity strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. 
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index rose
1.4 percent, having fallen 9 percent in August when global
markets were roiled by a sovereign downgrade in the United
States, persistent debt problems in the euro zone and downward
revisions in growth expectations.	
 In Japan, the Nikkei gained 1.4 percent to clear the
key 9,000 level for the first time in two weeks, while South
Korea's KOSPI added 2.2 percent despite economic data
showing the country's manufacturing sector shrank in August for
the first time in 10 months. 
 Credit spreads on Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment grade
index have tightened in early deals to 143.5/144 basis points
compared with Wednesday's close of 147.86 bps, after recording
their worst monthly performance of 2011 in August, IFR reported.	
 
 CHINA REASSURES	
 China's official PMI offered some reassurance about the pace
of growth, rising on Thursday to 50.9 in August from a 28-month
low of 50.7 in July and signalling some stabilisation in the
manufacturing sector on solid domestic demand. 
 However, the result was just below expectations and the
sub-index for new export orders dipped to 48.3 from 50.4,
suggesting that exports may weaken in the future.	
 In Australia, signs of a recovery in retail sales lifted
retail stocks, with department store Myer adding more
than 4 percent. 
 U.S. economic data overnight showed the economy continues to
struggle, and the U.S. Institute for Supply Management's
national manufacturing index is due at 1230 GMT, followed by the
U.S. Labour Department's employment report on Friday.	
 Fears that the ISM index may fall below 50 have been eased
by a brighter than expected reading of manufacturing activity in
the Chicago area released on Wednesday.	
 Among currencies, the Swiss franc held on to gains made the
previous day after a top government official said Switzerland
would have to live with a strong currency, while commodity
currencies steadied after an initial dip on Brazil's rate cut.	
 The Australian dollar was at $1.0697 , below from a
one-month high of $1.0722 hit on Wednesday.	
 The euro eased slightly to $1.4370 , slipping further
from a two-month high at $1.4550 hit at the start of the week,
though traders say the currency is essentially playing in a
range. 
 In commodity markets, spot gold held steady to be
little changed at 1,824.54 an ounce, to be up 29 percent this
year.	
 U.S. crude oil futures were steady after a slight decline
the previous day on the back of a larger-than-expected build in
U.S. crude inventories.

1618,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2011 07:40PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD gains in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - The euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Thursday, following worse than expected U.S. labor data and a marginal gain from Wall Street shares.
EUR/USD hit 1.4369 in early Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since Monday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4380, rising 0.06%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.4329, last Friday’s low, and resistance at 1.4549, Monday’s high.
Earlier in the day, payroll processing firm ADP reported that non-farm private employment in the U.S. rose less than expected to a seasonally adjusted 91,000 in August.
The August figure follows a 109,000 gain in July and fell short of market expectations of an increase to 103,000. 
Separately, data from the U.S. Census Bureau on Wednesday showed that factory orders jumped 2.4% in July, far exceeding economist’s forecasts of a 1% increase.
Germany’s Statistics office, earlier Wednesday, released data showing retail sales were flat in July, down from a revised 4.5% increase the previous month. Market expectations were for retail sales to fall by 1.5% in July.
Meanwhile, the euro was higher against both the British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP up by 0.06% to hit 0.8847, and EUR/JPY rising 0.07% to hit 110.26.
Weekly initial jobless claims data from the U.S. Department of Labor and the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) for the euro zone were due for release later Thursday."

 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world
rose for a fourth straight day on Wednesday, trimming August's
sharp losses as hopes for more help from the U.S. Federal
Reserve drove buying in equities, oil and metals.
 Markets have turned sharply in recent days, rebounding from
several weeks of losses that saw both Wall Street and global
stocks posting their worst performance in 15 months.
 Mounting speculation the Fed is preparing a new round of
monetary expansion has helped the market regain its footing.
The Fed's minutes from its latest policy session bolstered a
growing belief the central bank will hint at new stimulus after
its $600 billion bond-buying program expired in June. For
details, see [ID:nFEDAHEAD]
 If its efforts, along with fiscal stimulus plans, are
enough to forestall a recession, the market could continue to
recover.
 ""The depth of the slowdown is going to depend on what
monetary and fiscal stimulus we see in the United States,"" said
Gonzalo Fernandez, analyst at Santander in Mexico City.
 U.S. economic data released on Wednesday showed the economy
continues to struggle, with the pace of private sector job
growth slowing in August for the second straight month. Factory
activity in the Chicago region expanded at its slowest pace
since November 2009. [ID:nN1E77U04P] [ID:nCAT005506]
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 53.58 points, or 0.46 percent, at 11,613.53. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> added 5.97 points, or 0.49 percent, at
1,218.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 3.35
points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,579.46.
 Among the most actively traded U.S. stocks were AT&T ,
which fell 3.8 percent to $28.48 after the U.S. Justice
Department said it would block the cellphone company's merger
with T-Mobile USA on anti-competition concerns.

 European shares, tracked by the FTSEurofirst 300 index
<.FTEU3>, rose 2.9 percent and world equities gained over 1.2
percent.
 For the month, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was down 5.7 percent.
Global shares, tracked by the MSCI All World index
<.MIWD00000PUS>, showed a 7.6 percent drop. It was the sharpest
decline on both indexes since May 2010.
 Minutes of the Fed's August meeting, released on Tuesday,
showed the central bank considered a range of actions to help
the struggling economy, including the unprecedented step of
tying interest rate policy to a specific unemployment level.
[ID:nN1E77T1HY] [ID:nN1E77T08F] [ID:nN9E7H701R]
 In a note released on Wednesday, economists at Goldman
Sachs commented that the Fed was ""more dovish than expected,""
indicating the possibility of stimulus at the September 20-21
meeting was ""an even closer call than we thought previously.""
 Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on
Tuesday made clear he supported further action to support
growth, while Minneapolis Fed chief Narayana Kocherlakota
suggested further stimulus would have a hard time winning his
support.
 Commodities, tracked by the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
<.CRB>, ended the month flat, recovering from early fall in
August. Copper in New York  finished up 1.5 percent at
above $4.20 a lb, its highest close in a month. [MET/L]
 Crude oil futures in London  rose almost 1 percent,
above $114 a barrel. Oil was further boosted by a government
report showing a steep drawdown last week in U.S. gasoline
stockpiles. [O/R]
 Spot gold  , which tracks trade in bullion, was down
half a percent, at around $1,824 an ounce as rising equity
markets weakened safe-haven bids. An earlier rally through the
better part of August, however, pushed bullion up 12 percent on
the month. [GOL/]

(Updates prices, adds details)
 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc jumped against
the euro and the dollar on Wednesday after a top Swiss
government official said the nation would have to live with a
strong currency and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) stayed away
from intervention.
 The SNB has been conspicuously absent from the currency
forwards market since last week. It did not take any new
measures after making an announcement on three of the last four
Wednesdays in August.
 Switzerland's economy minister detailed plans to offset the
currency's impact on the economy but not to directly counter
its strength. For details, see [ID:nL5E7JV2LZ]
 ""We'll have to keep living with the strong franc for some
time. It must be a combination of measures that will lead us
into the future,"" said Economy Minister Johann
Schneider-Ammann.
 The scaling back of currency intervention speculation
pushed the euro down 2.6 percent to 1.15341 francs on
electronic trading platform EBS , while the dollar
slumped 2.2 percent to 0.8026 francs on EBS. 
 ""The franc is massively overvalued,"" Schneider-Ammann
said.
 It was the biggest daily loss in the dollar against the
Swiss franc since Aug. 9, when the dollar fell to a record low
of 0.70676 Swiss francs. The euro also saw its biggest one-day
decline since Aug. 9, when it fell to a record low of 1.0075
Swiss francs.
 The SNB's intervention in the swaps market and moves to
flood the Swiss banking system with francs and cut interest
rates to near zero had brought the Swiss franc back from
peaks.
 The low-yielding Swiss franc may recoup more losses from
earlier this month as the government lets markets decide its
fate, with policymakers expecting the currency to remain
strong, according to David Song, analyst at DailyFX in New
York.
 ""The rebound in the franc may gather pace in the days
ahead, and the Swissie may continue to outperform its major
counterparts as market participants diversify away from the
U.S. dollar,"" Song said.
 Analysts said the the Swiss franc looked oversold on daily
charts, having hit its lowest level since early July on
Monday.
 Mounting concerns about European sovereign debt and hopes
of new U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus drove investors back into
the safety of the Swiss franc, according to Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""While the threat of SNB intervention may slow the franc's
rise, it is unlikely to meaningfully deter investors from the
safe harbor offered by the franc.""
 For the month, the dollar has climbed 1.3 percent against
the Swiss franc, the first monthly gain since January 2011. The
euro has climbed 1.934 percent against the Swiss franc, the
first monthly gain since March.
 Traders also awaited Friday's key U.S. Labor Department
report on August unemployment and payrolls amid renewed
expectations the Fed would act again to boost the economy. 
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 76.534 yen. 
 With the yen hovering near a record high of 75.941 against
the dollar earlier in August on trading platform EBS, traders
remained wary of the potential for Japanese authorities to
intervene to sell the yen.
 The dollar slumped for the third straight month against the
yen.
 Against the dollar, the euro was last down 0.5 percent at
$1.4375 on EBS . Traders said month-end demand for
dollars from investors rebalancing stock and bonds portfolio
weighed on the euro.
 The euro gained 0.3 percent against the dollar in August,
the first monthly gain since June.

 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Stocks rose a fourth straight
day on Wednesday, trimming August's sharp losses, as hopes for
more U.S. stimulus drove most risk assets higher, including

 * Swiss franc climbs as euro zone debt concerns build again
 * Dollar undermined by dovish Fed minutes, QE speculation
 * German govt moves on EFSF support euro

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc rose against the
euro and the dollar on Wednesday as investors piled back into
the currency, with euro zone debt worries and speculation about
easing in the U.S. keeping alive the risk of intervention by the
Swiss National Bank.	
 The single currency dropped more than 1.5 percent to a
session low of 1.1631 francs on trading platform EBS,
while the dollar fell to a low of 0.8057 francs ,
retreating from a recent high of 0.8239 struck on Monday.
Traders cited Swiss franc buying by U.S. and Swiss investors. 
 Analysts said some investors were taking profits after the
euro failed to break through 1.2000 francs earlier this week,
while the Swiss franc looked oversold on daily charts, having
hit its lowest level since early July on Monday.	
 A German cabinet decision that set policymakers on course
for parliamentary ratification of changes to the euro zone's
bailout fund helped push the single currency briefly to a
session high of $1.4470 versus the dollar .

 But it was last flat on the day at $1.4440 as it ran into
selling by macro and real money investors. Traders said
month-end demand for dollars from investors rebalancing their
stock and bonds portfolio was weighing on the euro and cited
small sell orders starting from $1.4480. 
 Lukewarm demand at an Italian bond auction on Tuesday and
signs of backtracking on Rome's budget changes weighed on the
euro, reigniting worries over the enormous debt burden facing
the euro zone's third largest country. 
 ""The difficulty the market has at the moment is finding a
reason to buy any currency. The euro zone has got a peripheral
problem, the U.S. has got a potential QE problem,"" said Daragh
Maher, deputy head of FX research at Credit Agricole.	
 ""The Swiss franc remains a safe play. If numbers do not
improve, people remain nervous and the euro zone situation
remains grim we can expect to see the franc strengthen again.""	
 Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Aug. 9 meeting
showed policymakers discussed a range of unusual tools they
could use to help the economy, adding to expectations the Fed
may flag a third round of quantitative easing at its two-day
meeting in September. 
 Moves to inject more liquidity into the U.S. economy would
undermine the greenback and analysts said speculation was likely
to keep the dollar weak in the run-up to the meeting. On
Wednesday, the private sector ADP report will be released ahead
of the Chicago ISM data for August .	
 More weak data after U.S. consumer crumbled to a two-year
low on Tuesday is likely to add to speculation for more
quantitative easing. On the other hand, a positive surprise
could give riskier assets a slight boost.	
 
 FRANC DEMAND	
 Despite stock markets bouncing on Wednesday, demand for the
safe-haven Swiss franc returned with the Swiss National Bank
conspicuous by its absence from the forward market since last
week.	
 Its intervention in the swap market and moves to flood the
Swiss banking system with francs and cut interest rates to near
zero has toppled the Swiss franc from record highs hit earlier
this month.	
 As a result, the dollar is on track for its best monthly
performance against the franc since May 2010, and the euro for
its best since January 2011. The euro was last down 1.3 percent
at 1.1684 as was the dollar at 0.8086 francs.	
 In the options market, one-month euro/Swiss vols
edged higher to 17 percent on Wednesday, indicating
investors expect further strong moves in the Swiss franc as
concerns over a global growth slowdown persist.	
 ""The liquidity injection is close to an end in terms of new
money coming in, which means Swiss franc weakness is likely to
(end).... The SNB will have to intervene more aggressively from
now on,"" said George Saravelos, FX strategist at Deutsche Bank.	
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 76.55 yen , but was
seen supported by bids around 76.50 yen from Asian players. 
 With the yen hovering near a record high against the dollar
of 75.941 hit earlier in August on trading platform EBS, market
players remain wary of the potential for Japanese authorities to
intervene to sell the yen. Japan's Ministry of Finance said on
Wednesday that the authorities had conducted a total of $58.8
billion in forex intervention in the month to August 29.

 By Dominic Lau	
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for the fourth
session in a row on Wednesday on hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve
will ride to the economy's rescue with another stimulus package,
though global shares were still set to post their biggest
monthly drop in 15 months.	
 The prospect of more Fed action weighed on the dollar while
fresh concerns that Italy is struggling to cope with its debt
burden drove the euro lower against the safe-haven Swiss franc.

 Gold, bolstered throughout August by safe-haven buying,
eased 0.3 percent and was poised to post its biggest monthly
rise since November 2009.	
 The price of 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German
Bunds also rose sharply this month, with Treasury
yields down more than half a percentage point despite the U.S.
losing one of its AAA credit ratings. 
 Tuesday's slump in U.S. consumer confidence to its lowest in
two years, along with Fed minutes showing policymakers discussed
a range of unusual tools they could use to help the economy,
further bolstered expectations that the U.S. central bank is
ready to act.	
 The Fed's decision to hold a two-day meeting in September
instead of a one-day session has already helped stabilise
financial markets after a steep sell-off earlier in August on
concerns over slowing global growth and the euro zone debt
crisis.	
 ""Although the release of the FOMC meeting minutes offered
little in the way of consensus as to precisely what the central
bank will do next, it does still leave the door open for further
action so this may well help keep the general sentiment upbeat,""
said Cameron Peacock, market analyst at IG Markets.	
 U.S. stock index futures    rose 0.7 to
0.9 percent, indicating a firm start on Wall Street ahead of the
U.S. private sector jobs data at 1215 GMT.	
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading
shares climbed 1.3 percent, though it was still down 12 percent
in August and set for its biggest monthly fall since October
2008, a month after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.	
 Global equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
advanced 0.6 percent. The benchmark is down 8.2
percent this month, heading for its worst monthly percentage
drop since May last year.	
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average ended flat and was
down 8.9 percent in August, its biggest one month decline in 15
months.	


 
 DOLLAR DIPS	
 Expectations of further stimulus from the U.S. weighed on
the dollar, which was down 1.2 percent at 0.8103 francs
and 0.2 percent at 76.53 yen on Wednesday.	
 ""In the run-up to the September FOMC, we're probably going
to have a bit more chatter about QE3 ... which is likely to keep
the dollar weak,"" said Andrew Robinson, FX analyst for Saxo
Capital Markets in Singapore.	
 The U.S. currency was down 1.3 percent in August versus the
yen, despite Tokyo's efforts to weaken its currency through
intervention. The greenback is down 5.7 percent this year
against the yen, which has held its safe-haven appeal.	
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.4435, though the
single currency is up 7.9 percent against the dollar this year,
largely helped by Asian investors' moves to diversify their
assets.	
 Copper added 0.6 percent, up for the sixth day in a
row, while Brent crude  dipped 0.3 percent to trade below
$114 a barrel.	
 Yields on 10-year Treasuries were steady at 2.1723 percent
after falling about 60 basis points in August. Benchmark Bund
yields have dropped 40 basis points over the same period.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Ian Chua	
 SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Renewed concerns about
the euro zone sovereign debt crisis weighed on the single
currency on Wednesday, while the dollar also struggled after
minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Aug. 9 meeting bolstered
expectations for more stimulus. 
 The dollar and the euro both dipped against the yen, as
Japanese exporters bought the currency. 
 The euro remained under pressure after lukewarm demand at an
Italian bond auction threatened to push the euro zone's third
biggest economy back to the centre of the region's debt crisis.	
 Adding to the gloom, data showed euro zone economic
sentiment fell more than expected in August and a dispute over
Finland's demand for collateral in exchange for bailout loans to
Greece continued to fester. 
 ""It keeps coming back and it's going to be with us a bit
longer. But the issue for the next 20 hours or so will be funds
adjusting their hedge ratios, which a fair few of them do at the
end of each month,"" said Joseph Capurso, currency strategist at
Commonwealth Bank.	
 Capurso said these adjustments could see dips in the euro
and the Australian dollar and that could create some buying
opportunities in the Aussie. 
 The euro held steady at $1.4435 , having a hard
time regaining ground after dipping 0.5 percent on Tuesday.
Small sell orders are seen starting from $1.4480, traders
said. 
 Against the Australian dollar, the euro dipped 0.2
percent to A$1.3495 , hovering near a 3-1/2 week low
around A$1.3476 hit on Tuesday. 
 Weakness in the euro helped the dollar index pop back
up from Tuesday's low of 73.611. The dollar index, which
measures the dollar's value against a basket of currencies, last
stood at 73.973, on track for a 0.1 percent gain in August. 
 
 A slide in global equities on worries about the uncertain
outlook for the U.S. and global economies, as well as concerns
about the impact of the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis on the
European banking sector, caused a rise in risk aversion and has
lent support to the greenback this month.	
 But the dollar's upside has been limited due to growing
market speculation about further monetary easing by the Fed.	
 Minutes of the Fed's early August meeting released on
Tuesday showed policymakers discussed a range of unusual tools
they could use to help the economy, with some actually
pressuring for bold new steps to shore up a flagging recovery.

 This added to expectations the Fed may spring into action at
the next meeting in September, which Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
on Friday said would be extended to a two-day meeting. Any moves
to inject more liquidity would only serve to cement the dollar's
status as a funding currency in carry trades.	
 ""In the run up to the September FOMC, we're probably going
to have a bit more chatter about QE3...which is likely to keep
the dollar weak,"" said Andrew Robinson, FX analyst for Saxo
Capital Markets in Singapore. 
 Such market chatter might even help the euro break above its
recent range of roughly between $1.4150 and $1.4550, he said.	
 ""I would say I'm 60-40 or 70-30 in favour of an upside break
(by the euro),"" Robinson said.	
 
 JAPANESE EXPORTERS	
 Yen-buying by Japanese exporters helped lift the Japanese
currency, traders said.	
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 76.57 yen , but
was seen supported by dollar bids at levels around 76.50 yen
from Asian players. The euro slipped 0.3 percent to 110.53 yen
, with support on the daily Ichimoku chart coming in
right around 110.48 yen. 
 With the yen hovering near a record high against the dollar
of 75.941 yen hit earlier in August on trading platform EBS,
market players remain wary of the potential for yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 Commodity currencies were underpinned by the growing
prospect of further monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 
The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0695
, near its highest in more than three weeks of $1.0721
hit on Tuesday. 
 Trading is expected to be volatile in the lead up to the
influential U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday, with volumes
staying patchy in the final week of the northern-hemisphere
summer holidays and into the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Sept. 5.	
 Just ahead is the ADP report on the U.S. private sector
employment market as well as business activity in the Chicago
area due later on Wednesday. 
 Weaker-than-expected headlines will no doubt boost
expectations for the Fed to act at the September 20-21 meeting.

 By Vikram Subhedar	
 HONG KONG, Aug 31 (Reuters) - European stocks may edge
higher on Wednesday, poised to end a volatile month on a mildly
stronger note, while the dollar struggled on heightened
expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would do more to
stimulate the economy.	
 Minutes of the Fed's early August meeting released on
Tuesday showed policymakers discussed a range of unusual tools
they could use to help the economy, with some actually
pressuring for bold new steps to shore up a flagging recovery.

 This added to expectations the Fed may spring into action at
the next meeting in September.	
 ""The FOMC meeting minutes showed that Fed governors are
becoming anxious, indicating a few members felt that recent
developments justified a more substantial move,"" said Jessica
Hoversen, fixed income and foreign exchange analyst at MF Global
in note.	
 ""A rise in unemployment on Friday may push this faction of
Fed officials over the edge,"" she said.	
 Hopes of a Fed stimulus offered some respite to beaten down
European shares which could yet post their biggest monthly drop
since October 2008.	
 European stocks bore the brunt of the severe setback earlier
this month as markets were roiled by a sovereign downgrade in
the U.S., persistent debt problems in the euro zone and sharp
cuts to global growth expectations.	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
is down 13 percent this month while Germany's DAX has
slumped 21 percent and is down nearly 25 percent since hitting a
3-1/2 year high in May this year.	
 The indexes are expected to open 0.3-0.5 percent higher,
according to financial spreadbetters. 
 In Asia, the MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
is down 9.5 percent. On the day it rose 0.9
percent helped by a 1.7 percent jump in Korea's KOSPI .	
 U.S. stocks futures  pointed to an extension of the
modest overnight gains as signs of the Fed willing to take
aggressive steps helped offset the gloom from the slump in
consumer confidence in the U.S., which hit a two-year low.

 In Japan, the Nikkei closed flat at 8,955.2 on
profit-taking after four straight gaining sessions.	
 ""The index may stay in a narrow range below 9,000 until we
have more catalysts for a U.S. economic recovery,"" said Fumiyuki
Takahashi, managing director at Barclays Capital. 
 He added that domestic institutional investors such as
pension funds are buying below 9,000, while foreign investors
are hesitant to take positions ahead of U.S. non-manufacturing
data from the Institute for Supply Management and U.S. jobs data
later this week. 
 
 JOBS DATA AWAITED	
 A Reuters poll showed economist forecast U.S. non-farm
payrolls rising 80,000 in August with unemployment staying at
9.1 percent.	
 In currency markets, the euro fell across the board,
particularly against commodity currencies, after lukewarm demand
at an Italian bond auction threatened to push the euro zone's
third biggest economy back to the centre of the region's debt
crisis.	
 The dollar faced problems of its own as the prospect of
further monetary easing in the U.S. would further cement its
status as a funding currency in carry trades.	
 The dollar index which measures the dollar's strength
against a trade-weighted basket of currencies is down 6.3
percent this year and is poised to finish flat on the month.	
 Brent crude  hovered at $114 a barrel on Wednesday
after posting six days of gains on expectations the United
States will act again to try to stimulate its economy and boost
fuel demand. 
 Spot gold edged lower on the day, pulling back from a 2.6
percent rally in the previous session but in contrast to stocks,
is set for its biggest monthly gain since November 2009. It is
up 12.6 percent this month.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Gold, oil and bonds surged on
Tuesday while Wall Street rebounded in choppy trade after the
latest Federal Reserve minutes boosted expectations
policymakers will act again to try to stimulate the economy.
 U.S. stocks fell as much as 1 percent on a weak consumer
confidence reading before clawing back their losses and closing
higher. Gold and oil prices each jumped 2 percent, while
Treasuries rallied as investors piled into safe-havens on
worries about the economy.
 ""The Fed has recognized that economic conditions may
warrant more aggressive actions, which gives hope to the
prospect that something will be forthcoming at the next meeting
that will provide more to goose risk assets,"" said Mark
Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott in Philadelphia
 Consumer confidence in the United States hit a two-year low
in August and prices of single-family homes dipped in June from
May as the housing market continued to crawl along at depressed
levels, data showed on Tuesday. For details, see
[ID:nN1E77T08F] [ID:nN9E7H701O]
 Minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting this month, also
released on Tuesday, showed the central bank had considered a
range of actions to help a struggling economy, including the
unprecedented step of tying interest rate policy outlook to a
specific unemployment level. [ID:nW1E7IR01J]
 The Fed minutes helped Wall Street end up for a third
straight session. The market closed up nearly 3 percent on
Monday, its strongest gain in a week, but for the
month-to-date, the S&P index is down 6.14 percent.
 ""It looks like we're having some follow-through to
yesterday's move, which is an indication things have gotten
overdone in the past month. People are reassessing and seeing
some value,"" said John Derrick, director of research with U.S.
Global Investors in San The Fed initiative help

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 20.70
points, or 0.18 percent, at 11,559.95. The Standard & Poor's

1,212.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> ended up 14.00
points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,576.11.
 Thin volume helped to exaggerate the moves.
 OIL, GOLD SHINE WITH BONDS; EURO DOWN
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  touched a
session high of 99-21/32, up 28/32 from late Monday, after the
consumer confidence data. Late in the day, the 10-year note
was up 23/32, its yield at 2.1828 percent.
 Spot gold , which tracks trading in bullion, was up 2
percent, reaching nearly $1,833 an ounce.
 ""The market is certainly pretty nervy as are most markets
right now, so in the context of what's been happening in the
last few days, I'm not surprised to see that kind of move,""
said Credit Suisse precious metals analyst Tom Kendall.
 Bullion is up nearly 30 percent on the year. One of the
cornerstones of its rally over the last eight months has been
the Fed's ultra-loose monetary policy, which included a pledge
to leave rates near zero until 2012 after a $600 billion
bond-buying program that expired in June. [GOL/]
 In oil trading, London's Brent crude  ended up 2
percent at a four-week high above $114 a barrel as traders
tracked newly formed Tropical Storm Katia in the eastern
Atlantic and ahead of hopes for more economic stimulus by the
Fed. [O/R]
 Investors are anticipating a planned speech next week by
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that could hint at any monetary
expansion.
 Markets will also be watching euro zone debt issues for
signs the region's troubles do not worsen. Reuters on Monday
reported detailed proposals put forward by Finland regarding
its demand for collateral in return for providing more aid to
Greece. [ID:nB5E7JM00M]
 Helsinki's demands for collateral have sparked requests
from other countries, including Austria, the Netherlands,
Slovenia and Slovakia, for similar treatment and could
jeopardize euro zone attempts to save Athens from default.
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.44485 ,
retreating from Monday's two-month high of $1.4550.

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Gold and bonds surged on
Tuesday and U.S. stocks rebounded in choppy trade as a recovery
in risk appetite among some investors was countered by bearish
economic news.
 U.S. consumer confidence hit a two-year low in August and
prices of single-family homes dipped in June from May as the
U.S. housing market continued to crawl along at depressed
levels, data showed on Tuesday. [ID:nN1E77T08F]
[ID:nN9E7H701O]
 Stocks on Wall Street initially fell as much as 1 percent.
Gold jumped 2 percent and U.S. Treasuries hit session peaks as
investors piled into safe-havens due to worries about the
economy.
 Minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting this month, also
released on Tuesday, showed the central bank had considered a
range of actions to help a struggling economy, including the
unprecedented step of tying the interest rate policy outlook to
a specific unemployment level. [ID:nW1E7IR01J]
By mid-afternoon, the stock market had eased part of its
early loss, helped somewhat by the previous session's rally and
the premise that the market may have been oversold through most
of this month. Despite a weekend hurricane in the New York City
region that hampered commuting, the S&P 500 index of U.S.
stocks closed up more than 2 percent on Monday.
 Thin volume also resulted in a lack of committed sellers.
 ""It looks like we're having some follow-through to
yesterday's move, which is an indication things have gotten
overdone in the past month. People are reassessing and seeing
some value,"" said John Derrick, director of research with U.S.
Global Investors in San Antonio, Texas.
 By 2:20 p.m. EDT (1820 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 19.79 points, or 0.17 percent, at
11,559.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 1.62
points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,211.70. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> was up 10.48 points, or 0.41 percent, at
2,572.59.
 GOLD, BONDS SHINE; EURO DOWN
 Spot gold , which tracks trading in bullion, was up 2
percent, reaching nearly $1,833 an ounce.
 ""The market is certainly pretty nervy as are most markets
right now, so in the context of what's been happening in the
last few days, I'm not surprised to see that kind of move,""
said Credit Suisse precious metals analyst Tom Kendall.
 Bullion is up nearly 30 percent on the year. One of the
cornerstones of its rally over the last eight months has been
the Fed's ultra-loose monetary policy, which included a pledge
to leave rates near zero until 2012 after a $600 billion
bond-buying program that expired in June. [GOL/]
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  touched a
session high of 99-21/32, up 28/32 from late Monday, after the
consumer confidence data. By 1822 GMT, the 10-year note was up
24/32, with the yield at 2.1776 percent.
 Analysts said the Fed's Aug. 9 meeting minutes, due for
release Tuesday; a planned speech next week by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke and developments in euro zone debt will all be closely
watched by investors losing faith in the global economy's
ability to stave off another slowdown.
 The euro was down 0.6 percent at $1.4420 , retreating
from a two-month high of $1.4550 on Monday.
 Peripheral debt worries continued to haunt the euro zone.
Reuters on Monday reported detailed proposals put forward by
Finland regarding its demand for collateral in return for
providing more aid to Greece. [ID:nB5E7JM00M]
 Finland's demands for collateral have sparked requests from
countries including Austria, the Netherlands, Slovenia and
Slovakia for similar treatment and could jeopardize euro zone
attempts to save Athens from default.
 ""We're getting a bit of noise about what the euro zone is
up to, what it's not up to and what it should be up to,"" said
Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.
 ""It's getting so convoluted, all the demands from smaller
states like Finland, Austria, Slovakia ... If this is going to
be the case for a while to come, people are going to be
concerned that the crisis is going to drag on.""

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks snapped back from
Tuesday's early loss, joining safe-havens gold and bonds as
investors regained their risk appetite despite fundamentally
bearish news on the economy.

 * Euro down 0.7 pct vs dollar, slips 0.8 pct vs yen
 * Tepid demand at Italian debt auction weighs on single
currency
 * Euro also struggles on Greek bailout spat

 By Neal Armstrong	
 LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Tuesday
as weaker than expected demand at an Italian debt auction added
to worries over the euro zone periphery, with sentiment already
hit by bickering between euro zone countries about the terms of
a Greek bailout deal.	
 Traders brushed off gains in European shares, which largely
tracked a rise in the U.S. the previous day. U.S. equity futures
were trading in negative territory on Tuesday.  
 Market participants, including London traders returning from
a holiday on Monday, focused instead on divisions among euro
zone countries on how to solve the bloc's debt problems and
disappointing results at an auction of 7 and 10-year bonds.

 The euro fell to a session low of $1.4380 and was
last down 0.7 percent on the day at $1.4400, retreating from a
two-month high of $1.4550 hit on Monday. Traders said a series
of stop-losses were hit on the way down, with more lurking at
$1.4370/60, in line with the euro's 100-day moving average.	
 ""The Italian auction was relatively poor,"" said Adam Cole,
global head of fx strategy at RBC Capital markets. 
 ""The market is sensitive as to where the next pressure point
in the euro zone periphery is going to be and right now that's
looking like Italy,"" he added.	
 Traders said the European Central Bank bought significant
amounts of 10-year Italian debt in a renewed attempt to support
the market. 
 The euro was down close to 1 percent for the day against the
yen at 110.60 after traders said stop-losses were hit
through 111.00 and 110.80. 
 Peripheral debt worries continued to haunt the euro zone
with Reuters on Monday reporting detailed proposals put forward
by Finland regarding its demand for collateral in return for
providing more aid to Greece. 
 Helsinki's demands for collateral have sparked requests from
countries including Austria, the Netherlands, Slovenia and
Slovakia for similar treatment, and could jeopardise euro zone
attempts to save Athens from default. 
 ""We're getting a bit of noise about what the euro zone is up
to, what it's not up to and what it should be up to,"" said
Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS.	
 ""It's getting so convoluted, all the demands from smaller
states like Finland, Austria, Slovakia ... If this is going to
be the case for a while to come, people are going to be
concerned that the crisis is going to drag on.""	
 
 DOLLAR RISKS	
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against a currency
basket, helped by investors seeking a safe haven for their cash,
although many in the market see a growing likelihood of another
bout of quantitative easing (QE) by the U.S. central bank, which
would weaken the dollar.	
 QE would flood the financial system with more dollars and
probably boost stocks, higher yielding currencies and the euro.	
 Fed chief Ben Bernanke acknowledged slower-than-hoped-for
growth in the U.S. economy in a speech late last week, but did
not make clear the central bank would step in, saying only it
would hold a longer policy meeting this month to consider its
options. 
 Data on Monday showing a rise in U.S. consumer spending
suggested the economy is not falling back into recession,
although the risk remains that the economy will continue to
struggle but not enough to push the Fed into action.	
 The market was also awaiting minutes, due later in the day,
from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting earlier this month.
Any suggestion that more stimulus may be needed to boost the
fragile U.S. recovery is expected to spur selling in the dollar.	
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 76.74 yen, but
stayed above an all-time low around 75.94 set earlier in the
month, as market players remained wary of possible yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities. 
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda, who oversaw Japan's massive
intervention earlier this month, was voted in as prime minister
on Tuesday, suggesting no change in Japan's currency policy.

 By Anirban Nag	
 LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose to their
highest in nearly two weeks on Tuesday, while safe haven assets
like the Swiss franc and German Bunds were subdued, encouraged
by signs that the U.S. economy was not headed towards a
recession as yet.	
 With big-ticket data like U.S. job numbers due later this
week, many investors remain uncertain about a recovery in the
world's largest economy, leaving risk for a correction in
markets still trading at low holiday volumes.	
 But European shares rose 1.6 percent, tracking
gains on Wall Street and in Asia, while London shares advanced 2
percent in early trade, catching up with the broader market
after a holiday on Monday. 
 World stock markets, as measured by MSCI ,
rose 0.5 percent to their highest since August 18. The index is
still down nearly 15 percent from a May high, however, after
taking a hammering at the start of August due to growing
pessimism about the U.S. economy as well as worries over
Europe's sovereign debt crisis and banks.	
 ""With consumer confidence, the (U.S) ADP jobs report, ISM
Manufacturing, jobless claims and nonfarm payrolls report all
due in the coming days, there is going to be a lot of
nervousness around,"" said Ben Potter, strategist at IG Markets.	
 ""The market could also be seen as vulnerable given it has
rallied ahead of these big economic reports. We think a lot of
participants will be employing a 'wait and see' approach as we
navigate through the next few days.""	
 Investors would also await the minutes from the Federal
Reserve's last committee meeting on Aug 9 which could offer more
clues on divisions among board members over further stimulus
measures. 
 Still, the latest gains in stock markets encouraged some
investors to switch out of safe-haven assets like the Swiss
franc and core government bonds into higher-yielding currencies
such as the New Zealand dollar.	
 An Italian bond auction later in the day will serve as a
barometer of investor demand -- and give more hints how much
further the euro zone's debt crisis has to run -- after recent
bond purchases by the European Central Bank. 
 
 CREDIT CRUNCH	
 The Italian tender is likely to sail through smoothly and
could give a temporary boost to risk appetite, but it is
unlikely to lift broader concerns that the risk of contagion
could still engulf larger economies like Italy, Spain and
France.	
 These concerns have made investors such as U.S. money market
funds reduce exposure to European banks and pushed their credit
default swap spreads higher.	
 The Itraxx European senior financials index has
pushed beyond the peaks seen during the last crisis, and at 247
basis points the spread is starting to reflect credit ratings
that are not in line with their current ones.	
 The euro was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at
$1.4484, and also eased against the Swiss franc . 
 The franc , hit by Switzerland's efforts to weaken it
in the past month, traded slightly down against the dollar, at
0.8160 francs, hovering near a five-week low touched on Monday.	
 Spot gold stabilised around $1,797 per ounce levels
after falling by nearly seven percent in about a week. It hit a
record $1,911 last week.	
 ""In terms of fundamentals, (gold) still looks good. The only
risk to the downside is if the CME raises margin requirements
again,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 The CME Group raised margins on gold futures by
about 27 percent last week.	
 German Bunds reversed early gains as European equity markets
opened higher. German Bund futures briefly dipped into
negative territory and were last 9 ticks higher at 134.48.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc and other
safe-haven currencies remained under pressure on Tuesday while
commodity currencies held firm after a solid performance by
riskier assets the previous day, although persistent worries
about the global economy mean the tide could turn at any moment.	
 The euro also held near a two-month high hit on Monday and
some traders think it may have broken above its holding pattern
of the last few months, although many market players said
overwhelming debt problems in the euro zone were likely to keep
the single currency in check.	
 ""Looking at the tension in the dollar money market, it's
hard to see risk asset prices continuing to rise,"" said Minori
Uchida, senior analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. ""The
market is essentially in a lull.""	
 A combination of factors, including a 14 percent rally in
Greek stocks sparked by merger news in the country's
battered banking sector and better-than-expected U.S. consumer
spending data, helped to boost appetite for risk.

 This saw the Swiss franc, already hit by news that UBS
was considering charging a fee to deter clients from
hoarding the safe-haven currency, fall further across the board.	
 The dollar edged up 0.3 percent to 0.8185 Swiss francs
after reaching a five-week high of 0.8239 overnight. The
euro was at 1.1890 francs , not far off a seven-week
high of 1.1970 francs touched on Monday.	
 Expectations that the Swiss central bank may take more
measures to weaken the franc also hampered the currency.	
 The franc has fallen steeply in the last two weeks since the
Swiss National Bank slashed interest rates to zero and flooded
the market with the currency. The bank has threatened more
action to counter what it says is a ""massively overvalued""
franc.	
 
 STILL WARY	
 The yen, also highly sought after in times of market stress,
lost ground as well. The dollar edged up to 76.86 yen ,
pulling further away from an all-time low around 75.94 set
earlier in the month, as market players stayed wary of
yen-selling intervention by Japanese authorities.	
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda, who oversaw Japan's massive
intervention earlier this month , was voted in as prime
minister on Tuesday, suggesting no change in Japan's currency
policy.	
 The best performers were commodity currencies such as the
Australian dollar, which stormed past a series of technical
resistance levels including its 55-day and 100-day moving
averages to reach a four-week high at $1.0686 . 
That has cleared the way for the Aussie to test $1.0809, a
76.4 percent retracement of its decline from $1.1081 to $0.9927
from late July to early August.	
 The New Zealand dollar has gained 1.4 percent since the
start of the week, climbing to a one-month peak around $0.8526
from $0.8460 in New York, with stop-loss buying
triggered above $0.8510. 
 Traders warned that the moves in the kiwi and other
currencies occurred in volumes thinned by a holiday in London on
Monday and a hurricane sweeping through New York. Singapore is
on holiday on Tuesday.	
 Further choppy trading was seen likely to persist in the
last week of the Northern-hemisphere summer holidays and into
the Sept. 5 U.S. Labor Day holiday. 
Against the backdrop of improved risk appetite, the euro
gained on the greenback, rising to a near two-month high of
$1.4550 on Monday. It last traded at $1.4520 in Asia on
Tuesday, up slightly on the day.	
 Even the risk of the European Central Bank keeping rates on
hold well into next year, after ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet said the bank was reviewing the risks to price
stability, failed to dampen the spirits of euro bulls.

Its chart outlook brightened, after it broke above important
highs hit in recent months at 1.4518 and 1.4537, leading some
market players to expect more upside.	
 But heavy offers were lined up above 1.4560 and bears think
concerns over debt and the banking sector are likely to cap the
currency.	
 Borrowing costs for banks, especially those from euro zone
countries, have been rising on worries about their exposure to
euro zone sovereign debt.	
 The euro's firmness is the flipside of weakness in the
dollar, which has been weighed by speculation of more easing
from the Federal Reserve as fears of U.S. recession rise.	
 ""Although yesterday's U.S. data was pretty good, people are
talking about more easing by the Fed, keeping pressure on the
dollar. If upcoming data comes in weaker, there will be talk
about QE3,"" said Tsutomu Soma, manager of foreign securities at
Okasan Securities, referring to a third round of quantitative
easing.	
 The dollar's index against a basket of six currencies stood
at 73.65 , down 0.1 percent on the day and just above
strong support around 73.40-50.	
 Minutes of the Fed's Aug. 9 meeting due out later on Tuesday
and speeches by Fed officials Charles Evans and Narayana
Kocherlakota will be closely watched as market players looked
for any hints on what the divided central bank will do at its
policy meeting on Sept 20-21.	
 ""Expect to learn more about the pros and cons of balance
sheet duration-extension, more QE and cutting the interest rate
on excess reserves as well as the option that was selected --
extension of the 'extended period' language through mid-2013,""
BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note.
