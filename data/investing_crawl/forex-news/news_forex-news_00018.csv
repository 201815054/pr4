26,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2012 05:33AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/CHF weekly outlook: July 9 - 13,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar surged to a one-and-a-half year high against the Swissie on Friday, as lowered expectations for a fresh round of easing by the Federal Reserve and sustained concerns over global economic growth boosted demand for the safe haven greenback. USD/CHF hit 0.9793 on Friday, the pair’s highest since December 13, 2010; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9770 by close of trade on Friday, surging 3.05% over the week. The pair is likely to find support at 0.9664, the low of May 31 and resistance at 0.9793, last Friday’s high. The greenback rallied broadly after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday that the economy added 80,000 jobs in June, below market forecasts for a gain of around 90,000. April figures were revised to 68,000 from 77,000 jobs, while May's numbers were revised to 77,000 from 69,000. The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 8.2% in June, in line with expectations. Although the employment report was weaker than expected, many investors said it was not bad enough to spur the U.S. central bank to launch a third round of quantitative easing. In Switzerland, official data showed on Friday that consumer price inflation fell 0.3% in June, in line with expectations. Separately, the Swiss National Bank said that foreign currency reserves rose to CHF364.9 billion in June from CHF305.9 billion the previous month. Meanwhile, market sentiment remained under pressure as a series of stimulus measures by world central banks added to global growth concerns. On Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said that the economic outlook faces downside risks, adding that indicators for the second quarter point to weakening growth in the euro zone. Draghi refused to speculate, however, on the chances of a third round of Long Term Refinancing Operations, which provides cheap loans to European banks to encourage them to lend. The comments came after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low 0.75% in July, in a bid to bolster faltering growth in the region. In addition, Bank of England policymakers voted to increase the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves by GBP50 billion to GBP375 billion, in order to shield the recession hit U.K. economy from the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone. Elsewhere, China surprised traders by cutting interest rates for the second time in less than a month on Thursday, signaling that growth is slowing more than Beijing expected. In the week ahead, investors will be closely watching ECB President Draghi’s testimony before the European Parliament, on Monday, as well as a two-day meeting of euro zone finance ministers, amid expectations for a final agreement on aid for Spanish banks. Markets will also be eyeing the minutes of the Fed’s latest policy meeting as well as U.S. data on trade balance and unemployment claims.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets. Monday, July 9 Euro zone finance ministers are to meet in Brussels for a first day of talks. Tuesday, July 10 Euro zone finance ministers are to hold a second day of talks in Brussels. Wednesday, July 11 The U.S. is to release official data on trade balance and crude oil stockpiles, followed by the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s most recent policy-setting meeting. The minutes will be closely watched for signs of future monetary policy decisions by the central bank. Thursday, July 12 The U.S. is to publish government data on unemployment claims and official data on import prices, followed by the monthly Treasury statement. Friday, July 13 Switzerland is to release official data on producer price inflation, a leading indicator of consumer inflation. The U.S. is to round up the week with government data on producer price inflation and a preliminary report by the University of Michigan on consumer sentiment.S>>"

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was sharply higher against the euro, with EUR/USD tumbling 1.14% to hit 1.2385. The euro came under broad selling pressure after ECB President Draghi stated that the economic outlook faces downside risks, adding that indicators for the second quarter point to weakening growth in the euro zone. The ECB president stated that there was probably a ""renewed weakness in economic growth"" in the last three months, with ""heightened uncertainty"". Draghi also refused to speculate on the chances of a third round of Long Term Refinancing Operations, in which provides cheap loans to European banks in an attempt to encourage them to lend. The comments came after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low 0.75% in July, in a bid to bolster faltering growth in the region.  The central bank also lowered its marginal lending to 1.50% from 1.75% and the deposit facility rate to 0% from 0.25%. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD giving back 0.41% to hit 1.5524. Earlier in the session, Bank of England policymakers voted to increase the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves by GBP50 billion to GBP375 billion, in order to shield the recession hit U.K. economy from the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone. The central bank reported, “The weaker outlook for U.K. output growth means that the margin of economic slack is likely to be greater and more persistent.” The bank also left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, where it’s stood since March 2009, in a widely expected move. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.10% to hit 79.96 and USD/CHF surging 1.14% to hit 0.9696.

The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.87%, to trade at 82.95.  The greenback found support after positive U.S. employment data eased expectations for further monetary easing measures by the Federal Reserve. The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 30 fell to a seasonally adjusted 374,000, compared to expectations for a decline to 385,000.  The data came after payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose by a seasonally adjusted 176,000 in June, easily surpassing expectations for an increase of 105,000.  A separate report showed that service sector activity in the U.S. grew at a slower rate than expected in June. The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index declined by 1.6 points to 52.1 in June from a reading of 53.7 in May. Analysts had expected the index to decline by 0.7 points to 53.0 in June. "

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD adding 0.23% to hit 1.2604. The greenback remained down after Monday indicated the U.S. manufacturing sector had contracted for the first time since July 2009 in June. The weak data increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may implement a third round of quantitative easing to support economic growth, which has been hit by the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone. Investors were awaiting the outcome of the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday, amid growing expectations for a rate cut to help bolster growth in the bloc. Data on Monday showed that the unemployment rate in the region rose to a record in May, while the manufacturing sector remained firmly in contraction territory in June. The greenback edged lower against the pound, with GBP/USD gaining 0.01% to hit 1.5694. Earlier Tuesday, data showed that construction activity in the U.K. fell at the fastest rate in two-and-a-half years in June, as output and new orders both fell. The weak data added to speculation that the Bank of England will implement a fresh round of stimulus measures at Thursday’s policy meeting, after data on Monday showed that the U.K. manufacturing sector contracted for a second successive month in June. Elsewhere, the greenback was up against the yen, with USD/JPY adding 0.44% to trade at 79.86, but turned lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF losing 0.25% to trade at 0.9527. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.40% to 1.0126,AUD/USD rising 0.23% to 1.0274 and NZD/USD easing up 0.12% to hit 0.8044. The Australian dollar was little changed earlier after the Reserve Bank of Australia left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3.50%, in line with expectations. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, dipped 0.13%, to 81.88. In addition Tuesday, official data showed that U.S. factory orders rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in May, above expectations for a 0.2% gain, increasing for the first time in three months."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.60% to hit 1.2585. The U.S. Institute for Supply Management reported the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.7 in June, down from 53.5 in May, as new orders declined sharply. Analysts had forecasted the index to slip down to 52.0.  The single currency came under broad selling pressure earlier in the day amid concerns over the effectiveness of a new European agreement to tackle the debt crisis in the euro zone after Finland and the Netherland’s reiterated their opposition to using euro zone bailout funds to purchase government bonds. On Friday, European leaders agreed to use the euro zone’s bailout funds to support struggling banks directly, without adding to national debt, and to purchase government debt in order to keep borrowing costs down. Leaders also agreed to set up a joint banking supervisory body for the euro area. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD moving down 0.15% to hit 1.5680. The pound found some support earlier a report indicated that manufacturing activity in the U.K. improved in June, but conditions remained fragile. The U.K. manufacturing PMI rose to 48.6 in June from a reading of 45.9 in May, but remained below the 50 level which separates contraction from expansion. Analysts had expected a reading of 46.7.  Elsewhere, the greenback fell to a session low against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.55% to 79.36, but was higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF climbing 0.56% to hit 0.9541.

Earlier Monday, data showed that China’s HSBC PMI posted a reading of 48.2 in June, little changed from an initial estimate of 48.1, remaining in contraction territory for the eighth successive month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.31%, to 81.97. In other news Monday, official data indicated the unemployment rate in the euro zone rose to a record high 11.1% in May, up from 11.0% in April.

During European trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling% to hit 1.2428. Hurting single currency bullish sentiment,  hopes that European leaders would make headway on dealing with the crisis dimmed after a German government official indicated that the summit would not result in any detailed decisions and warned against high expectations among investors ahead of the conclusion of the summit on Friday. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angel Merkel reiterated her opposition to the idea of joint euro zone bonds, while EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Wednesday that the summit would focus on short-term measures to stabilize markets and ease pressure on at-risk countries. Adding to the negative tone, Italy saw long term borrowing costs rose to 6.19%, their highest level since December, following an auction of 10-year bonds, as investor sentiment on the country continued to deteriorate. Meanwhile, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds ticked up to 7%, the level that prompted Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek international bailouts. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.47% to hit 1.5498. In the U.K., official data confirmed that Britain’s economy contracted by 0.3% in the three months to March, but the contraction in the previous quarter was revised up to 0.4%, from a preliminary estimate of 0.3%. Another report showed that the U.K. current account deficit widened to GBP11.17 billion in the first quarter, from a shortfall of GBP7.22 billion in the fourth quarter.  Economists had expected the current account deficit to widen to GBP9.0 billion. The weak data reinforced expectations that the Bank of England may implement a third round of quantitative easing measures to shore up growth, possibly as soon as next month. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen but higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY declining 0.40% to hit 79.39 and USD/CHF advancing 0.30% to hit 0.9660. The greenback was up against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.36% to hit 1.0284,AUD/USD shedding 0.23% to hit 1.0057 and NZD/USD slipping 0.18% to hit 0.7902. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies advanced 0.28%, to 83.00. The greenback was little changed after the U.S. Department of Labor said number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week fell by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 386,000, compared to expectations for a decline of 7,000 to 385,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 392,000 from a previously reported 387,000. A separate report confirmed that the U.S. economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.9% during the first quarter, in line with expectations. "
180,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 28, 2012 12:04PM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD down on U.S. employment data, summit fears","Investing.com - The euro traded down against the U.S. dollar Thursday, as skepticism that a summit of European leaders in Brussels will deliver meaningful steps to tackle the debt crisis in the regioncombined with positive U.S. employment data,  weighed on the single currency.EUR/USD hit 1.2408 during U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since June 4; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2433, down 0.28%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2441, Monday’s low and a two-week low and resistance at 1.2582, the high of June 22. Hurting the single currency, hopes that European leaders would make headway on dealing with the crisis dimmed after a German government official indicated that the summit would not result in any detailed decisions and warned against high expectations among investors ahead of the conclusion of the summit on Friday. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angel Merkel reiterated her opposition to the idea of joint euro zone bonds, while EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Wednesday that the summit would focus on short-term measures to stabilize markets and ease pressure on at-risk countries. Adding to the negative tone, Italy saw long term borrowing costs rose to 6.19%, their highest level since December, following an auction of 10-year bonds, while yields on five-year bonds rose to 5.84% compared with 5.66% at a previous auction, as investor sentiment on the country continued to deteriorate. Meanwhile, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds ticked up to 7%, the level that prompted Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek international bailouts. The euro edged higher against the pound, with EUR/GBP adding 0.15% to 0.8021, but remained close to a three-week low against the yen, with EUR/JPY giving back 0.76% to hit 98.65.

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was up against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.12% to hit 1.2488. The euro gave up modest early gains against the greenback after Spain experienced short-term borrowing costs increase sharply at an auction of government debt. Spain’s Treasury auctioned slightly more that the targeted amount of EUR 3 billion, selling EUR1.6 billion worth of three-month government bonds at an average yield of 2.36%, up sharply from 0.84% at a similar auction last month. Spain also sold EUR1.48 billion of six-month debt at an average yield of 3.23%, up from 1.73% in May. The spike in borrowing costs came following the mass downgrade of 28 Spanish banks by ratings agency Moody’s on Monday, after Spain’s government formally requested aid of up to EUR100 billion for its banks. Following the auction, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to 6.77%, re-approaching the critical 7% threshold, which is widely viewed as unsustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, Italy’s Treasury sold EUR2.99 billion worth of two-year bonds at an average yield of 4.71%, the highest since December. Investors also remained jittery ahead of the upcoming EU summit, amid skepticism that leaders would make progress on greater fiscal integration and allowing the bloc's rescue funds to buy government debt. In the U.S., a report showed that U.S. consumer confidence declined more-than-expected in June, falling to the lowest level since January. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence fell to 62.0 in June from a downwardly revised reading of 64.4 last month and disappointing expectations for a reading of 63.5. A separate report showed that the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller U.S. house price index fell at an annualized rate of 1.9% in April from a year earlier, better than expectations for a 2.5% drop. The greenback was solidly lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.37% to hit 1.5633. Earlier in the day, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said an interest rate cut would be less effective in stimulating the U.K. economy than more quantitative easing. In testimony to Parliament's Treasury Committee, King said the outlook for the U.K. economy had deteriorated in recent weeks as a result of the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone. The comments came after official data showed that public sector net borrowing in the U.K. rose to GBP17.9 billion in May, up from GBP15.2 billion in the same month last year. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY down 0.27% to hit 79.45 and USD/CHF rising 0.26% to hit 0.9628. The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.05% to hit 1.0284,AUD/USD rising 0.15% to hit 1.0024 and NZD/USD climbing 0.17% to hit 0.7886. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, dipped  0.05%, to trade at 82.59. Later Tuesday, finance ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Spain were to meet in Paris, to hold talks ahead of the EU summit on Thursday and Friday."

During U.S. afternoon  trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.56% to hit 1.2499. Single currency sentiment soured amid growing doubts over whether European leaders will make any progress towards greater fiscal integration and allowing the bloc's rescue funds to buy government debt at a two-day summit meeting due to begin on Thursday. Meanwhile, fears that the debt crisis in the euro area is creating a drag on global growth continued to weigh, following a string of data last Thursday which pointed to weak U.S. manufacturing activity, a shrinking Chinese manufacturing sector and slowing business activity across the single currency bloc. Earlier Monday, Spain’s government formally requested aid of up to EUR100 billion for its banking sector from its euro zone partners. Spain’s economy minister said the amount should be enough to cover the needs of all banks and provide an additional security buffer. The request came after the results of an independent audit last week indicated that Madrid would need a rescue package of as much as EUR62 billion to bailout its banks. The greenback was also up against the pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.16% to hit 1.5559. Speculation over the possibility of more easing from the Bank of England continued after BoE policymaker David Miles said earlier that a ""substantial"" amount of monetary stimulus was needed to shore-up growth in Britain's ""stalled"" economy. In an interview with the Financial Times, Miles reiterated his support for a GBP50 billion expansion of the central bank’s asset purchase program. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the traditional safe haven yen, with USD/JPY tumbling 1.02% to hit 79.61, but extended gains against the Swiss franc with USD/CHF climbing 0.54% to hit 0.9606. The greenback strengthened against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD gaining 0.54% to hit 1.0301,AUD/USD falling 0.81% to hit 0.9982 and NZD/USD down 0.55% to hit 0.7860.

256,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 25, 2012 12:05PM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD slammed on summit anticipation, Greek resignation","Investing.com - The euro traded lower against the U.S. dollar Monday, pressured by worries that the upcoming European Union summit will disappoint hopes for progress on solving the euro zone’s debt crisis, while unconfirmed reports of the Greek finance minister tendering his resignation further dampened euro zone sentiment.EUR/USD hit 1.2472 during U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since June 12; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2485, tumbling 0.68%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2385, the low of June 4 and resistance at 1.2558, the session high. Single currency sentiment weakened amid growing doubts over whether European leaders will make any progress towards greater fiscal integration and allowing the bloc's rescue funds to buy government debt at a two-day summit meeting due to begin on Thursday. In addition, unconfirmed news of the Greek finance minister resigning further weighed on euro zone sentiment. Meanwhile, concerns that the debt crisis in the euro area is creating a drag on global growth continued to weigh, following assorted data last Thursday pointing to  weak U.S. manufacturing activity, a shrinking Chinese manufacturing sector and slowing business activity across the single currency bloc. Earlier Monday, Spain’s government formally requested aid of up to EUR100 billion for its banking sector from its euro zone partners. Spain’s economy minister said the amount should be enough to cover the needs of all banks and provide an additional security buffer. The request arrived after the results of an independent audit last week indicated that Madrid would need a rescue package of as much as EUR62 billion to bailout its banks. The euro was also weaker against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP giving back 0.46% to hit 0.8027 and EUR/JPY plunging 1.73% to trade at 99.34. The dollar remained little changed after official data showed that U.S. new home sales surged to a one-year high last month, indicating that the housing market may be gaining some momentum. The Commerce Department said new home sales rose 7.9% to a seasonally adjusted 369,000 units in May, the highest rate since April 2010 and outstripping expectations for a gain of 0.6% to 346,000. New home sales for April totaled 343,000 units. The median sales price of new houses sold in May was USD234,500"

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was sharply higher against the euro, with EUR/USD plunging 1.14% to hit 1.2562. Market sentiment was hit after data showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region contracted at the steepest rate since August this month, adding to concerns over the pace of the U.S. economic recovery. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index dropped by 10.8 points to minus 16.6 in June from May’s reading of minus 5.8. Analysts had expected the index to rise by 7.1 points to 1.3 in June. A separate report showed that U.S. existing home sales fell more-than-expected in May, falling by 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted 4.55 million units, outstripping expectations for a 1.1% decline to 4.57 million units. Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people filing for initial jobless benefits fell by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 387,000 last week, disappointing expectations for a decline of 9,000 to 380,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 389,000 from a previously reported 386,000. In the euro zone, data showed that manufacturing activity in the region contracted at the fastest pace since June 2009 this month, while manufacturing activity in Germany slowed to the lowest level in three years, as the ongoing euro zone crisis hit export demand. Investors remained wary ahead of the outcome of an audit of Spanish banks later in the day, amid concerns that the results could show that a EUR100 billion bailout for the country’s banks agreed earlier this month would not be large enough. Spain’s Treasury sold slightly more than the targeted amount of EUR2 billion at an action of government debt earlier in the session, but the country’s borrowing costs rose sharply.  The average yield on the five-year bond climbed to 6.07%, up from 4.96% at a similar auction last month. The greenback was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.54% to hit 1.5633. The pound found some support earlier in the session after official data showed that U.K. retail sales rose 1.4% in May, beating expectations for a 1.1% rise, following a 2.4% decline in April.  Elsewhere, the greenback gained ground against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 0.88% to hit 80.22 and USD/CHF jumping 0.98% to hit 0.9545. Earlier in the day, a Bank of Japan policymaker said the central bank is prepared to take bold action to support the economy, signaling the possibility of further monetary easing.  The greenback was stronger against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD gaining 0.75% to hit 1.0258,AUD/USD tumbling 0.93% to hit 1.0098 and NZD/USD down 0.48% to hit 0.7924. In Canada, official data showed that retail sales declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in April, confounding expectations for a gain of 0.3%, after rising by 0.4% in March. The New Zealand dollar had strengthened in the Asian session after official data showed that the country’s economy grew by 1.1% in the three months to March, beating expectations for a 0.5% rise and following a 0.4% expansion the previous quarter. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.98%, to trade at 82.40.

Meanwhile, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds pulled back to 6.77%, after climbing to euro-era highs earlier in the week, amid fears that Madrid will be forced to seek a full-fledged international bailout. Sentiment on the greenback remained weak as the Federal Reserve made the decision to ramp up Operation Twist by $267 billion throughout the rest of the year.   The greenback was slightly lower against the pound, with GBP/USD edging up 0.07% to hit 1.5735. The pound fell to a session low against the greenback earlier after the minutes of the Bank of England’s June meeting showed that four policymakers, including central bank Governor Mervyn King, voted in favor of another round of quantitative easing this month, while five voted against. Meanwhile, official data showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the U.K. rose to 8,100 in May, defying expectations for a decline of 3,000. The U.K. unemployment rate held steady at 8.2%, in line with expectations. Elsewhere, the greenback climbed to a session high against the yen, with USD/JPY climbing 0.54% to hit 77.38, but remained lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF sliding 0.17% to hit 0.9452. In Switzerland, a report showed that investor sentiment plunged to its lowest level in five months in June, amid worries over the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone. The Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) said its indicator of Swiss economic sentiment tumbled to minus 43.4 in June from a reading of minus 4.0 the previous month. Analysts had forecast a reading of minus 15.0.  The greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.21% to hit 1.0198,AUD/USD dipping 0.01% to hit 1.0188 and NZD/USD down 0.20% to hit 0.7965. Earlier Wednesday, official data showed that New Zealand’s current account deficit widened to NZD2.8 billion in the first quarter, against expectations for a deficit of NZD1.1 billion as dairy export prices and oil exports fell and the nation imported more fuel. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was little changed, dipping 0.10%, to trade at 81.53."
346,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 20, 2012 11:57AM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD higher on Operation Twist anticipation, Greek fears","Investing.com - The euro traded higher against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, following the announcement of a Greek coalition agreement, while investors expect an expansion of Operation Twist at the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s policy meetingEUR/USD hit 1.2723 during U.S. morning trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2702, gaining 0.13%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2567, Tuesday’s low and near-term resistance at 1.2746, Monday’s high and a one-month high. The euro climbed to a session high after Evangelos Venizelos, the head of Greece’s Pasok party, announced that a coalition government had been formed, which will allow Athens to resume negotiations with creditors on its international bailout deal. Following the announcement, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party Antonis Samaras was sworn in as the new Greek prime minister. Meanwhile, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds pulled back to 6.75%, after climbing to euro-era highs earlier in the week, amid fears that Madrid will be forced to seek a full-fledged international bailout. Sentiment on the greenback remained subdued ahead of the outcome of the Fed’s policy setting meeting, amid speculation that the U.S. central bank may implement a third round of quantitative easing measures after a recent string of disappointing economic data. The majority of economists predict the Fed will expand its Operation Twist beyond the current $400 billion in an effort to spur growth and buy protection against a possible European contagion. Any stimulus from the Fed is considered bearish for the greenback. The euro extended gains against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBPup 0.17% to hit 0.8079 and EUR/JPY jumping 0.92% to trade at 101.07. The Federal Reserve’s policy announcement was to be followed by a closely watched press conference with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, to discuss the bank’s decision."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the greenback was down against the euro, with EUR/USD soaring 1.12% to hit 1.2718. The U.S. central bank was to begin its two-day policy meeting later Tuesday, amid growing expectations that policymakers may announce fresh monetary stimulus measures after a recent string of weak economic data. Earlier Tuesday, official data painted a mixed picture of the U.S. housing sector as the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose more-than-expected in May, rising to 0.780 million, the highest level since September 2008, blowing past expectations for an increase to 0.728 million. But U.S. housing starts fell to 0.708 million last month, compared to expectations for a decline to 0.720 million. In the euro zone, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds eased back from session highs but remained above the critical 7% threshold amid concerns that a EUR100 billion bailout agreed earlier this month may not be enough to secure the country’s troubled banking system. Madrid saw short-term borrowing costs rise to euro-era highs at an auction of government bonds earlier Tuesday.   Elsewhere, a report showed that the ZEW index of economic sentiment in Germany tumbled in June, amid concerns over political instability in Greece and worries over sovereign debt contagion. Meanwhile, investors remained hopeful that Greece's New Democracy party would form a coalition government with the socialist Pasok party, which would allow Athens to resume negotiations with creditors on its international bailout deal. The greenback was slightly lower against the pound, with GBP/USD moving up 0.52% to hit 1.5749. Sterling remained under pressure after an unexpected decline in U.K. consumer price inflation in May added to expectations for more quantitative easing from the Bank of England, as until now inflation has been easing more slowly than the bank had hoped. The U.K. Office for National Statistics said that consumer price inflation fell to 2.8% year-over-year from 3.0% in April, defying forecasts for an unchanged reading. Elsewhere, the greenback edged lower against the yen, with USD/JPYdipping 0.08% to hit 79.04, but posted steep losses against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF falling 0.79% to hit 0.9473. The greenback was also weaker against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.67% to hit 1.0172,AUD/USD rising 0.57% to hit 1.0183 and NZD/USD advancing 0.62% to hit 0.7969. In Canada, government data showed that wholesale sales rose by 1.5% in April, beating expectations for a 1.0% increase, moving higher for the third successive month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.99%, to trade at 81.43. Leaders from the Group of 20 nations were continuing to hold a second day of talks in Los Cabos, Mexico."

During U.S. trade, the dollar moved higher against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.53% to hit 1.2572. The euro came off early highs against the greenback after the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds surged to a euro-era high of 7.28%, amid concerns that a EUR100 billion bailout agreed earlier this month may not be enough to overhaul the country’s ailing banking system. The 7% threshold is widely considered unsustainable in the long run and is the level at which Greece, Ireland and Portugal were forced to seek international bailouts. Meanwhile, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds remained above 6% amid fears over sovereign debt contagion to the euro zone’s fourth largest economy. Investors were also jittery amid concerns over the ability of Greece’s New Democracy party to form a strong coalition government in order to allow Athens to resume financial aid negotiations following Sunday’s narrow election victory. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.35% to hit 1.5660. The pound was weighed by speculation that the Bank of England may announce further quantitative easing measures, as investors looked ahead to Wednesday’s minutes from the central bank’s June meeting. Elsewhere, the greenback pared gains against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.25% to hit 78.89, but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF advancing 0.52% to hit 0.9552. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD up 0.45% to hit 1.0260, AUD/USD dipping 0.02% to hit 1.0077 and NZD/USD up 0.32% to hit 0.7904. Earlier Monday, official data showed that foreign investors’ acquisitions of Canadian securities rose significantly more-than-expected in April, rising to CAD10.16 billion, far outstripping expectations for a CAD5.0 billion increase. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.58%, to trade at 82.28. The Mexican G-20 summit has started, amid hopes it could produce fresh measures to combat the crisis in Europe.  In a statement, G-20 leaders said it was in ""all our interests"" for Greece to remain in the euro zone while respecting its international bailout commitments."

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.30% to hit 1.2594. The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week increased to 386,000, disappointing expectations for a decline of 5,000 to 375,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 380,000 from a previously reported 377,000. A separate report showed that U.S. consumer price inflation was up 0.2% in May, but core consumer prices fell 0.3%, the sharpest monthly decline since December 2008. Bu the euro remained vulnerable as the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 6.92%, after briefly breaking through the critical 7% threshold earlier, a level widely seen as unsustainable in the long run. The spike in borrowing costs came one day after ratings agency Moody’s cut Spain’s credit rating by three notches to just above junk status and warned that further cuts were possible. Earlier Thursday, Italy sold the maximum targeted amount of EUR4.5 billion of government bonds, but the country’s three-year borrowing costs jumped to the highest level since December, pressure higher by concerns over sovereign debt contagion. Meanwhile, investors remained jittery ahead of Sunday’s closely watched general election in Greece, amid fears that a win for anti-bailout parties could precipitate a Greek exit from the euro zone.

Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar shrugged off official data showing that domestic house prices rose slightly less-than-expected in April, climbing 0.2%, following a 0.3% increase the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.25%, to trade at 82.38.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was down against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.72% to hit 1.2594. The Commerce Department said U.S. retail sales declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in May, falling for the second successive month, marking the first back-to-back- decline in two years. April’s figure was revised to a 0.2% decline from a previously reported gain of 0.1%. Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, fell by 0.4% last month, the biggest decline since May 2010. A separate report showed that U.S. producer price inflation fell 0.2% in May, the largest monthly decline since July 2009. The weak data added to expectations that the Fed may implement a third round of easing to shore up economic growth after Chicago Fed President Charles Evans reiterated his support for additional monetary stimulus on Tuesday. The euro remained under pressure amid worries that a bailout of as much as EUR100 billion for Spain’s banks will add to the country’s debt burden and make it more difficult for Madrid to access credit markets. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds ticked up to 6.76% earlier, close to the critical 7% level, which is viewed as unsustainable in the long run after it prompted bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Meanwhile investors were focused on the outcome of Sunday’s general election in Greece, which could determine if the country remains in the euro zone. The greenback edged lower against the pound, with GBP/USD inching up 0.06% to hit 1.5579. Elsewhere, the greenback weakened against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY slipping 0.15% to hit 79.39 and USD/CHF giving back 0.57% to hit 0.9550. In Switzerland, official data showed that producer price index ticked down 0.2% in May, in line with expectations after a 0.1% decline the previous month. In addition, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD losing 0.19% to hit 1.0242, AUD/USD rising 0.40% to hit 0.9998 and NZD/USD gaining 0.43% to hit 0.7804.

Earlier Wednesday, Italy saw one-year borrowing costs surge to the highest level since December at an auction of government bonds, amid growing fears the country will be the next euro zone member to require a bailout.

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar traded lower against the euro, with EUR/USD gaining 0.08% to hit 1.2492. Hurting the greenback,  the U.S. federal budget balance fell less-than-expected last month, official data showed on Tuesday. In a report, Department of the Treasury said that U.S. federal budget balance fell to a seasonally adjusted -124.6B, from 59.1B in the preceding month. Analysts had expected U.S. federal budget balance to fall to -125.0B last month. The euro erased gains against the greenback after the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds hit a euro-era high of 6.82%, moving closer to the critical 7% threshold which precipitated bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The single currency rose to a session high against the greenback earlier, boosted by hopes that Spain’s bailout would help to stabilize markets. However,  Spain’s borrowing costs pushed higher amid uncertainty over the source of the rescue funds and whether the bailout repayments would add to the country’s already high borrowing costs. Investors also remained jittery ahead of Sunday’s general election in Greece, which could decide the course of the country’s future in the euro zone. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.34% to hit 1.5537. Earlier Tuesday, official data showed that manufacturing output in the U.K. fell 0.07% in April, disappointing expectations for a more modest 0.2% decline and fuelling speculation over a fresh round of easing from the Bank of England.  Elsewhere, the greenback was slightly higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY edging up 0.07% to hit 79.49 andUSD/CHF inching up 0.10% to hit 0.9628. The yen weakened against the greenback in Asian trade, after the International Monetary Fund said earlier that the currency was ""moderately overvalued,"" and indicated that it supported Japan’s view on yen weakening interventions, given current market conditions. In Switzerland, the government revised up its forecast for economic growth Tuesday, saying strong domestic demand was helping to offset the damaging effects of the strong Swiss franc on the country’s export sector. The State Secretariat for Economics said it now expected growth of 1.4% for 2012, up from a March forecast for 0.8% growth, but warned that a severe recession in the euro zone would have a knock-on effect for Switzerland. The greenback remained weaker against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.27% to hit 1.0288, AUD/USD advancing 0.44% to hit 0.9906 and NZD/USDrallying 0.72% to hit 0.7744. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was almost unchanged on the day, inching up 0.01%, to trade at 83.07. In the U.S., official data showed that import prices fell broadly in line with market expectations in May, while the previous month’s figure was revised to a flat reading. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said import prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.0% in May, in line with expectations.

515,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 11, 2012 01:43PM ET</span>",Forex- Greenback regains lead on Spanish bailout concern,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar eased higher against its major counterparts Monday, as an initial euro relief rally on the back of a bailout for Spanish banks faded amid uncertainty over the details of the deal, while investor focus also shifted to Greece. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar erased losses against the euro, with EUR/USD dipping 0.12% to trade at 1.2503, after falling from a session high of 1.2669. The euro rallied more than 1% against the greenback earlier after euro zone finance ministers agreed to grant Spain a loan of up to EUR100 billion, which the government will use to recapitalize the country’s ailing banking sector. But initial optimism faded as details of the Spanish bailout agreement remained unclear, with the amount Madrid will receive to be decided after the results of independent banking audits are published later this month. Investor sentiment also softened ahead of a Greek general election this weekend, which could determine if the country is to remain on in the euro zone. The greenback remained lower against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.17% to hit 1.5498, off an earlier high of 1.5582. Elsewhere, the greenback dipped lower against the yen, with USD/JPY inching down 0.06% to hit 79.40 and was little changed against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF easing down 0.01% to hit 0.9594. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.21% to hit 1.0281,AUD/USD up 0.14% to hit 0.9929 and NZD/USD rising 0.37% to hit 0.7731. The growth linked Aussie and kiwi dollars found support after Sunday’s unexpectedly strong Chinese import and export data eased concerns over a ‘hard landing’ in the world’s second largest economy, following a surprise interest rate by the country’s central bank last week. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, eased higher by 0.05% on the day, to trade at 82.93. In addition, Monday government data indicated French manufacturing output fell 0.7% in April, while a separate report reflected Italy’s gross domestic product gave back 0.8% in the first quarter, reigniting concerns that economic growth in the euro area is slowing."

The pair was likely to find support at 1.2440, Wednesday’s low and resistance at 1.2687, the high of May 23. In testimony to a congressional committee in Washington, Bernanke stated that the Fed remained ""prepared to take action"" to protect the U.S. economy and financial system if stresses on the financial system escalate, but stopped short of indicating what these actions might be. The single currency advanced to a session high against the greenback earlier after the People's Bank of China reported  it will lower benchmark interest rates, in a bid to bolster growth in the world’s second largest economy and counter the effects of a slowdown in global growth. In other news, solid demand at an auction of Spanish government debt and fresh hopes that European leaders are stepping up efforts to tackle Spain's banking crisis also bolstered investor sentiment on the single currency. Spain’s Treasury successfully sold EUR2.07 billion of bonds, slightly more than the targeted amount, in an auction which met with solid investor demand, but saw borrowing costs rise. The euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP falling 0.57% to hit 0.8074, but remained higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY adding 0.34% to hit 99.97. Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 377,000, in line with expectations.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the euro was higher against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD up 0.81% at 1.2551.. Speaking at the ECB’s post policy meeting press conference, Draghi said that there were “increased downside risks” facing the European economy, stemming from the debt crisis in the region and its increasing potential to spill over to the wider economy. Draghi said the ECB would extend its policy of unlimited three-month loans for banks until mid-January 2013, but didn't announce any new three-year lending operations, disappointing hopes that the bank would implement fresh easing measures to help stabilize markets. However, Draghi also promised to lend central bank support should things deteriorate in the region lending support to the single currency.  Earlier Wednesday, the ECB left euro zone interest rates unchanged at 1%, in a widely expected decision. The decision came one day after Spain warned that it was having difficulty accessing credit markets, while uncertainty over the outcome of Greek elections on June 17 also weighed. The greenback remained broadly weaker ahead of Congressional testimony by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on the outlook for the U.S. economy on Thursday, amid speculation that the U.S. central bank is mulling new measures to stimulate growth. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.53% to hit 1.5463. In the U.K., a report showed that construction sector activity continued to expand in May, but the pace of growth moderated. The Markit/CIPS U.K. construction purchasing managers' index came in at 54.4 in May, down on April's 55.8, but still well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.39% to hit 1.2449. Sentiment on the euro remained negative after a teleconference between finance ministers from the G7 group of industrialized nations concluded without a breakthrough in tackling the ongoing debt crisis in the single currency bloc. Speaking following the talks, Japan’s Finance Minister Jun Azumi said G7 members agreed to work together to deal with problems in Spain, while adding that officials did not discuss the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro area. The euro fell to a session low against the greenback earlier after Spain’s treasury minister said that financial markets were effectively closed to Spain because of the current high level of the country’s borrowing costs. Meanwhile, weak euro zone service sector data underlined concerns over the ongoing deterioration in the region’s economy. Revised data showed that the euro zone's services sector contracted at a slightly slower rate than initially expected in May, but still shrank at the fastest pace since June 2009. Supporting the U.S. dollar, the Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index inched up to 53.7 last month from a reading of 53.5 in April. Analysts had expected the index to remain unchanged. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.13% to hit 1.5362. Elsewhere, the greenback was stronger against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY climbing 0.44% to hit 78.68 and USD/CHF rising 0.39% to hit 0.9647. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.04% to hit 1.0389,AUD/USD adding 0.15% to hit 0.9742 and NZD/USD shedding 0.30% to hit 0.7541. The Canadian dollar found support after the Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1% earlier, and flagged up the possibility of a rate hike in the coming months, saying ""some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate."" The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.32%, to trade at 82.91."

During U.S. morning trade, the euro was trading higher against the greenback, with EUR/USD rising 0.39% to hit 1.2484. Sentiment on the U.S. dollar was lifted after European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said he supported the idea of a European banking union. Earlier Monday, Portugal’s Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar announced that the country's EUR78 billion bailout program was on track. Gaspar also said Lisbon is planning a EUR6.65 billion liquidity injection to shore up the country’s fragile banking system. In addition, official data released earlier showed that producer price inflation in the euro zone was flat in April, which could give the ECB leeway to cut rates ahead of its policy meeting this week. But investors remained wary of pushing the single currency too high amid concerns over the outlook for global growth in the wake of Friday’s dismal U.S. employment data, while worries that Spain’s high borrowing costs could force Madrid to seek a bailout also weighed. The greenback edged lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.05% to hit 1.5371. Trading volumes remained thin on Monday, as markets in the U.K. were closed for the Queen’s jubilee. Elsewhere, the greenback pushed higher against the safe haven yen, with USD/JPY adding 0.36% to hit 78.31.    Earlier Monday, the governor of the Bank of Japan said the central bank was closely monitoring the impact of the yen’s recent gains on the country’s largely export driven economy. The comments came after the BoJ conducted a rate check on Friday, indicating that it is still prepared to intervene in currency markets to curb the currency’s gains. The greenback was weaker against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF falling  0.50% to hit 0.9611. The greenback ticked lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.02% to hit 1.0409,AUD/USD advancing 0.27% to hit 0.9725 and NZD/USD gaining 0.42% to hit 0.7577. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.29%, to trade at 82.67.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was hovering close to an almost two-year high against the euro, with EUR/USD easing up 0.06%, striking 1.2375. Investor sentiment was hit after official data showed that the U.S. economy grew at a slower rate than initially estimated during the first three months of 2012, with first quarter gross domestic product expanding by 1.9%, in line with expectations, down from an initial estimate of 2.2%. Meanwhile, the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 383,000, defying expectations for a decline of 3,000 to 370,000. A separate report showed that the U.S. private sector added 133,000 jobs in May, missing expectations for an increase of 148,000. In addition, data showed that manufacturing activity in the Chicago area slowed significantly more-than-expected in May, falling to the lowest level since September 2009. Market sentiment remained somewhat supported by expectations that Ireland would pass a vote for the European Union’s fiscal treaty in a referendum on Thursday. Elsewhere, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds eased back to 6.51%, after climbing to a euro-era high of 6.7% on Wednesday as the lack of a convincing plan to recapitalize stricken lender Bankia fuelled fears that Madrid will be forced to seek an international bailout. The greenback rose to a four-month high against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.57% to hit 1.5390. Elsewhere, the greenback extended losses against the traditional safe haven yen, with USD/JPY tumbling 0.67% to hit 78.54. The greenback erased losses against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF easing up 0.06% to hit 0.9716. The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.39% to hit 1.0341,AUD/USD losing 0.10% to hit 0.9695 and NZD/USD falling 0.29% to hit 0.7509. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.03%, to trade at 83.14.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was trading close to a 22-month high against the euro, with EUR/USD  plummeting 0.94% to hit 1.2386. The greenback strengthened broadly amid concerns over the situation in Spain, where rising bond yields, the growing costs of bank rescues and a recession hit economy fuelled fears that Madrid will be forced to seek an international bailout. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed to 6.7% earlier Wednesday, approaching the critical 7% threshold that preceded bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Investor sentiment briefly found support earlier after the European Commission said that stricken euro zone banks could be recapitalized directly through the region’s permanent bailout fund. In its report on euro zone economic strategy, the Commission also supported the idea of “joint debt issuance” or euro bonds, an idea which has met strong opposition from Germany and said the euro zone should move towards the idea of a full banking union. Meanwhile, concerns over the outcome of Greek elections mounted after an opinion poll showed anti-austerity party Syriza in the lead ahead of the June 17 vote, fuelling concerns that the country will reject the terms of its bailout agreement and be forced out of the euro area. The greenback was also sharply higher against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.91% to hit 1.5498.

Elsewhere, the greenback slumped to a three-month low against the traditional safe haven yen, with USD/JPY dropping 0.70% to hit 78.93, but posted strong gains against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF surging 0.87% to hit 0.9689. The yen found support earlier after the Bank of Japan signaled that it is likely achieve its 1% inflation target without further monetary easing, but did not rule out fresh stimulus measures if the crisis in the euro zone pressures the economy. The greenback was hovering close to multi-month highs against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD advancing 0.60% to hit 1.0284, AUD/USD falling 1.11% to hit 0.9739 and NZD/USD losing 0.97% to hit 0.7553.

During European afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD easing 0.14% to hit 1.2534. Investor sentiment firmed up after a weekend opinion poll indicated that Greek pro-bailout party New Democracy may be able to form a government following elections on June 17, after inconclusive election results earlier this month sparked fears that the country could be forced out of the euro area. However,  sentiment remained fragile amid uncertainty over the outcome of the June elections, while fears over the health of Spain’s banking sector and the country’s rising borrowing costs also weighed. Spain’s government announced Sunday that it was to recapitalize one of the country’s largest commercial lenders, fuelling fresh fears that the rising cost of bank rescues could force Madrid into seeking an international bailout. Spain’s Treasury auctioned the full targeted amount of EUR3.5 billion of two-year bonds earlier, but the yield climbed to 4.03%, up sharply from 3.35% at a similar auction in April. Meanwhile, the yield on Spanish 10-year government bonds climbed to 6.50% on Monday, up from 6.34% on Friday. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.11% to hit 1.5682. Elsewhere, the greenback was weaker against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY dropping 0.27% to hit 79.47 and USD/CHF losing 0.08% to hit 0.9589. Earlier Monday, the minutes of the Bank of Japan’s April 27 meeting revealed that lawmakers agreed to ease monetary policy in order to ensure the continued economic recovery, but said that the central bank needs to counter the “misunderstanding” in markets that easing will automatically continue until the bank’s 1% inflation target is met. The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD down 0.54% to hit 1.0236,AUD/USD jumping 0.91% to hit 0.9847 and NZD/USD rallying 0.95% to hit 0.7610. In Australia, central bank Governor Glenn Stevens said that in addition to the debt crisis in the euro zone, China’s slowing growth poses a threat to the Australian economy and must be closely monitored. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.21%, to trade at 82.34.

The yield on Spain’s 10-year bond rocketed to 6.47% earlier in the day, the highest this year and a level considered unsustainable in the long run, after closing at 6.34% on Friday.  The spike in long-term borrowing costs came after Spain’s government announced Sunday that it was to recapitalize one of the country’s largest commercial lenders, Bankia, sparking fears over the rising cost of bank rescues on government spending. Investor sentiment was lifted earlier as fears over the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro zone subsided after weekend opinion polls showed increasing support for pro-bailout party New Democracy ahead of elections due to be held on June 17. The euro advanced against the pound but traded lower against the yen, with EUR/GBP adding 0.12% to hit 0.8000 and EUR/JPY shedding 0.09% to trade just above a three-and-a-half month low at 99.53. Trade looked likely to remain quiet on Monday, with some markets in Europe closed for holidays, while markets in the U.S. were to remain closed for the Memorial Day holiday."

790,By Investing.com,"<span>May 25, 2012 10:03AM ET</span>",U.S.dollar slightly higher on Spanish fears,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was trading slightly higher  against its major counterparts Friday, as fears that Spain may be losing access to capital markets overshadowed euro zone joint bond hopes,  sending investors into the safety of the greenback. During U.S. morning trade, the EUR/USD gave back 0.09% to hit 1.2523. The shared currency gave back earlier gains after Catalan President Artur Mas repeated his call for Spanish central government to help regions access funding at briefing with reporters today in Madrid. The euro traded at almost its lowest level since July 2010 after a Greek opinion poll showed an anti- bailout party gaining support before June 17 elections. Providing support to the euro, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti stated, during a television interview, “Europe can have euro bonds soon. Germany has an interest in ensuring no country leaves the euro, while Greece will probably remain in the 17 – nation currency region even as anything can happen.”  The EU summit ended yesterday with a plea to Greek voters to elect a pro - austerity governement on June 17 in order to keep the troubled island nation in the euro zone. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel left open a potential compromise on debt sharing via joint nation bonds in the euro area lifting hopes of cooperation. Euro area finance ministers do not plan on meeting again until after the Greek elections next month, which potentially will determine Greek’s future in the euro zone. The Greek June election was called after a May 6 vote left no party able to form a government, as voter sent the anti-bailout Syriza party to second place. The greenback traded lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.06% to hit 1.5678. Earlier in the week, data from the U.K. showed that the economy contracted by 0.3% in the three months to March, more than preliminary estimate for a 0.2% contraction, driven by the sharpest quarterly contraction in construction since the first quarter of 2009. Elsewhere, the greenback was marginally lower against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.03% to hit 79.57, and pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF adding 0.20% to hit 0.9581.. The greenback was  higher against its Canadian, yet lower against Australian and New Zealand, with USD/CAD ahead by 0.03% to hit 1.0272, AUD/USD gaining 0.17% to hit 0.9780 and NZD/USD rising 0.42% to hit 0.7576. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gave back 0.08% to trade at 82.37. "

813,By Investing.com,"<span>May 24, 2012 12:12PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD flat on euro zone fears and weak U.S. data,"Investing.com - The euro traded flat against the U.S. dollar Thursday, as euro zone economic fears depressed the single currency, while disappointing U.S. manufacturing data cast doubts over the strength of the country’s economic recoveryEUR/USD bounced from 1.2516, the pair’s lowest since July 6, 2010, to hit 1.2576 during U.S. afternoon trade, easing 0.05% lower on the session The pair was likely to find support at 1.2516 and resistance at 1.2598, the session high. The euro found support against the greenback after the Commerce Department reported U.S. core durable goods orders gave back a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in April, defying analyst’s expectations for a 0.9% gain and lower for the second consecutive month. Total durable goods orders, which include transportation items, inched by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in April, below expectations for a 0.5% gain. However, demand for the safe haven greenback remained supported after dismal euro zone economic data earlier in the day sparked fresh concerns over the impact of the crisis on the region’s troubled economy. The euro was knocked lower as a report indicated that manufacturing activity in the euro area contracted at the fastest pace since June 2009 in May, while service sector activity shrank at the steepest pace in seven months. Germany manufacturing activity slowed to the lowest level in almost three years in May, sparking fresh fears over the impact of the euro zone debt crisis on the region’s largest economy. A separate report showed that the German Ifo business climate index deteriorated significantly more-than-expected in May, pressured lower by uncertainty in the euro zone. Market participants also remained risk adverse after Wednesday’s summit of European Union leaders made little signs of progress in tackling the debt crisis in the region. Elsewhere, the euro slipped lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP dipping 0.04% to hit 0.8014 and EUR/JPY easing down 0.11% striking 99.89. In other news Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week fell to a seasonally adjusted 370,000, meeting expectations. "

1001,By Investing.com,"<span>May 15, 2012 01:51PM ET</span>",Forex - U.S. dollar surges on Greek talk breakdown,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar climbed to a new four month high against the euro and strengthened against most of its other major counterparts Tuesday, after talks aimed at forming a coalition government in Greece broke down. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.55% to hit 1.2752. The euro erased gains against the greenback after Panos Kammenos, the leader of a conservative party which opposes Greece's international bailout deal, said cross party talks had failed, thwarting efforts to avoid new elections. An interim government will be appointed Wednesday, with new elections likely in early June. The announcement fuelled fears over the country’s ability to uphold its financial commitments and its possible exit from the euro zone. The euro rose to a session high against the greenback earlier, after official data showed that Germany’s economy expanded more-than-expected in the first quarter, indicating that the euro zone’s largest economy is weathering the effects of the crisis in the region. Germany’s gross domestic product grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in the three months to March, above expectations for a growth of 0.1%. A separate report showed that the euro zone avoided a recession in the first quarter, as GDP growth remained flat, defying expectations for a contraction of 0.2%. The euro zone economy contracted by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the U.S., government data showed that retail sales inched up 0.1% in April, disappointing expectations for a 0.2% gain and growing at the weakest pace in four months. Meanwhile, U.S. consumer prices, including food and energy costs, were flat last month for the first time since December. A separate report showed that an index of manufacturing activity in New York jumped to 17.1 in May from 6.6 in April.  Analysts had expected the index to rise to 8.5 in May. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.49% to hit 1.6014. The pound was largely unchanged earlier, after official data showed that the U.K.’s trade deficit remained unchanged at GBP8.6 billion in March.  Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY rising 0.53% to hit 80.27 and USD/CHF climbing 0.56% to hit 0.9419. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD gaining 0.02% to hit 1.0039, AUD/USD rising 0.05% to hit 0.9962 and NZD/USD giving back 0.33% to hit 0.7739. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, advanced 0.69%, to trade at 81.35."

During U.S. trade, the dollar was trading close to a four-month high against the euro, with EUR/USD shedding 0.58% to hit 1.2842. Bearish speculation over the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro zone intensified Monday, as talks aimed at forming a coalition government remained stalemated. The stalemate fueled fears that a fresh round of elections is becoming inevitable and cast doubts over the country’s ability to uphold its fiscal commitments. Meanwhile, concerns over the health of Spain’s banking system persisted, pushing the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds to 6.27%, the highest level since December, after an auction of government bonds earlier saw the country’s short-term borrowing costs rise. Adding to the bearish sentiment, official data showed that industrial production in the euro zone unexpectedly declined 0.3% in March, against expectations for a 0.4% increase, fuelling fears over the health of the region’s economy. However,  the greenback traded lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.27% to hit 1.6112. The pound remained supported by the view that sterling is a good safe haven alternative to the euro. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY slipping 0.21% to hit 79.76 and USD/CHF climbing 0.56% to hit 0.9350. In Switzerland, official data showed that producer prices slipped 0.1% in April, declining for the first time in five months and defying expectations for a 0.3% increase. The greenback was stronger against its Canadian counterpart and rose to multi-month highs against its Australian and New Zealand cousins, withUSD/CAD adding 0.20% to hit 1.0025, AUD/USD losing 0.42% to hit 0.9976 and NZD/USD falling 0.61% to hit 0.7780.

1024,By Investing.com,"<span>May 14, 2012 12:37PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD plunges as Greek euro zone exit weighed,"Investing.com - The euro traded sharply lower against the greenback Monday, striking a four-month low as worries regarding Greece leaving the euro zone rocked confidence in the single currency.EUR/USD hit a low of 1.2826 during U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since January 18; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2848, falling 0.53%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2733, the low of January 18 and resistance at 1.2903, the session high. Speculation regarding the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro zone intensified, as talks aimed at forming a coalition government remained stalemated. The deadlock energized fears that a fresh round of elections is becoming inevitable and brought worries to the surface over the country’s ability to uphold its fiscal commitments. Meanwhile, concerns over the health of Spain’s banking system remained, pushing the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds to 6.27%, the highest level since December, after an auction of government bonds earlier saw the country’s short-term borrowing costs rise. Adding to the bearish sentiment, official data indicated that industrial production in the euro zone unexpectedly declined 0.3% in March, against expectations for a 0.4% increase, fuelling fears over the health of the region’s economy. The euro dropped to a three-and-a-half year low against the pound, with EUR/GBP giving back 0.72% to hit 0.7980 and hit a three-month low against the yen, with EUR/JPY dropping 0.92% to hit 102.30. In other news Monday, European Union finance ministers were set to hold talks in Brussels, while Greece’s president was due to hold last-ditch cross party talks in an attempt to avert fresh elections."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD adding 0.30% to hit 1.2966. The single currency found support as hopes Greek Socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos would form a government on Thursday, after stating he would approach all political party leaders and try to get New Democracy, Syriza and Democratic Left to form a pro-European national unity government. On Wednesday, Alexis Tsipras, the head of Greece’s second-biggest party Syriza, gave up his attempt to form a new government, pushing the debt-stricken country closer to its second election in a few weeks. Investors were nervous earlier after the European Central Bank cut its 2012 gross domestic product growth outlook to minus 0.2% from minus 0.1%, in its monthly report published earlier, as downside risks remain to the economic outlook. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.20% to hit 1.6159. Sterling found support after a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggested that gross domestic product in the U.K. grew by 0.1% in the three months ending in April after declining by 0.2% in the three months ending in March.   Earlier in the day, the Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5%, in a widely expected move and announced no change to the size of its asset purchase facility which stands at GBP325 billion, following a GBP50 billion increase in February. The announcement came after stronger-than-expected U.K. manufacturing production data, which showed the first increase in three months. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen but lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 0.35% to hit 79.93 and USD/CHF retreating 0.26% to hit 0.9266. The yen slightly weakened earlier after Bank of Japan policymaker Sayuri Shirai said the central bank will not rule out any policy options to deal with Japan’s current economic outlook, signaling the possibility of further easing measures.     The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD declining 0.22% to hit 1.0004, AUD/USDclimbing 0.75% to hit 1.0124 and NZD/USD advancing 0.46% to hit 0.7876. The Australian dollar rallied earlier after official data showed that Australia’s unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 4.9% from 5.2% in March. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to rise to 5.3% in April. Commodity-related currencies remained under pressure however, after data showed that Chinese exports and imports in April were well below analysts’ expectations. In a report, the Customs General Administration of China said the nation’s trade surplus widened to USD18.42 billion in April from USD5.35 in the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.07%, at 80.19. "

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar rose to a three-and-a-half month high against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.59% to hit 1.2928. The single currency was pressured amid mounting expectations that a fresh round of elections in Greece is inevitable as attempts to form a coalition government fail. On Tuesday, Alexis Tsipras, the head of Greece’s second-biggest party Syriza, stated that Greece's financial aid package is null and void, fuelling concerns over a disorderly Greek default or possible exit from the single currency bloc. Meanwhile, speculation arose that Spain is set to announce plans to support its banking system. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose above 6% earlier, reflecting investor concerns over holding riskier assets. Investors also remained concerned over whether French president-elect Francois Hollande’s focus on growth rather than austerity measures as a means to tackle the crisis could spark tensions with Germany. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.07% to hit 1.6096. In the U.K., a report indicated retail sales posted their biggest fall in more than a year in April, as unseasonably wet weather weighed on sales of summer clothing and outdoor goods. The British Retail Consortium reported retail sales tumbled 3.3% year-on-year, following a 1.3% rise in March, confounding expectations for a 0.5% gain. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the safe haven yen but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY falling 0.22% to hit 79.69 and USD/CHF climbing 0.32% to hit 0.9265. The greenback climbed to multi-month highs against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.19% to hit 1.0006,AUD/USD tumbling 0.41% to hit 1.0078 and NZD/USD retreating 0.56% to hit 0.7832. Earlier in the day, Australia’s Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that the government will cut spending for the first time in 42 years, ending four years of budget deficits and giving the central bank flexibility to lower interest rates. The comments came after official data showed on Tuesday that Australia’s trade deficit more than doubled in March, as commodity exports declined for a third successive month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.25%, at 80.14.. In addition, Wednesday, official data showed that German exports and imports both hit record highs in March, fuelling hopes that the euro zone’s largest economy is weathering the effects of the debt crisis. The Federal Statistics Office said exports increased by 0.9% to EUR91.8 billion, while imports rose 1.2% to EUR78.1 billion. "

During European morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.17% to strike 1.3030. Traders were watching Greek developments as political leaders continued to hold cross party talks after the country’ largest party, New Democracy, was unable to reach an agreement to form a government on Monday. The uncertainty fuelled fears that Greece will not have a government in place in time to secure its next tranche of international aid next month, as new elections look increasingly likely. Investors remained nervous amid concerns over new French president-elect, Socialist Francois Hollande who has said he wants to renegotiate the euro zone’s fiscal pact in order to stimulate growth in the region. Single currency sentiment found some support after official data indicated that German industrial production jumped 2.8% in March, easily surpassing expectations for a 0.8% increase, after declining in each of the previous three months. The German economy ministry also said the ""the outlook for industry has improved significantly"". The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD declining 0.17% to 1.6164. Industry data indicated that house price balance in the U.K. fell more-than-expected in April, declining 19% after an 11% fall the previous month. Analysts had expected house price balance to fall 10% in April. Elsewhere, the greenback was steady against the yen and higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY easing 0.07% to hit 79.83 and USD/CHF adding 0.21% to hit 0.9225. The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.55% to hit 0.9985, AUD/USD giving back 0.64% to 1.0133 and NZD/USD retreating 0.52% to 0.7905. The Australian dollar came under pressure after government data indicated that Australia’s trade deficit more than doubled in March, widening to AUD1.59 billion from a deficit of AUD0.75 billion the previous month, as commodity exports fell.  Economists had expected Australia’s trade deficit to widen to AUD1.38 billion in March.

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD losing 0.24% to hit 1.3054. Single currency sentiment improved following a steep decline,  after weekend election results in Greece threw the future of the country’s international bailout agreement into doubt and fuelled fears over a possible Greek exit from the euro zone. Neither of the country’s two pro-bailout parties secured enough votes to form a government, as voters favored smaller parties who campaigned against harsh austerity measures. Meanwhile, in France, President Nicolas Sarkozy was defeated by socialist candidate François Hollande, who has been critical of the country's austerity program. Risk appetite was also weighed by fears that the U.S. economic recovery is losing momentum after official data on Friday showed that the economy added 115,000 jobs in last month, far short of expectations for a 170,000 increase. The greenback slid lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.26% to hit 1.6191. The greenback edged higher against the yen, with USD/JPY easing higher 0.05% to hit 79.89 and pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF rising 0.32% to hit 0.9209. Earlier in the day, government data indicated that the rate of unemployment in Switzerland was 3.1% in April. A separate report showed that Swiss consumer price inflation rose less-than-expected last month, adding 0.1%, against expectations for a 0.2% increase. Elsewhere, the minutes of the Bank of Japan’s April policy meeting reported that the economy was showing signs of improvement but a high degree of uncertainty regarding the global outlook remained. The greenback was little changed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.18% to hit 0.9939, AUD/USD adding 0.31% to hit 1.0213 and NZD/USD slipping 0.11% to hit 0.7945. The Canadian dollar was little changed earlier after domestic data indicated the number of new building permits issued rose unexpectedly in March, climbing 4.7%, defying expectations for a 1.5% decline. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.12%, at 79.69. Trading volumes were expected to remain light on Monday, with markets in the U.K. closed for a bank holiday."

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was sharply higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.66% to hit 1.3149. In the U.S., payroll processing firm ADP reported the private sector added 119,000 jobs in April, far short of expectations for a gain of 177,000, after an increase of 209,000 in March. It was the smallest increase in ADP nonfarm payrolls since September 2011. This report is viewed as a precursor to the official payroll data released Friday. The data added to fears that the economic recovery in the U.S. is losing momentum. A separate report indicated that factory orders in the U.S. declined in line with expectations in March, falling 1.5%, following a 1.1% increase the previous month. Meanwhile, fears over the economic outlook for the euro zone weighed on market sentiment after final euro zone manufacturing data for April slumped to a 34-month low, while the unemployment rate in the bloc climbed to a record 10.7% in March. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD losing 0.15% to hit 1.6197. The pound remained supported after reports earlier showed that construction sector activity in the U.K. declined less-than-expected in April, while U.K. mortgage approvals rose unexpectedly in March. Elsewhere, the greenback edged higher against the yen but posted strong gains against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY inching up 0.07% to hit 80.14 and USD/CHF climbing 0.67% to hit 0.9138. The greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.37% to hit 0.9891,AUD/USD shedding 0.29% to hit 1.0302 and NZD/USD falling 0.66% to hit 0.8097. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.47% to hit 79.28."
1239,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2012 12:14PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD trades lower on weak global numbers,"Investing.com - The euro moved lower against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, as weak euro zone economic data outweighed unexpectedly feeble U.S. job numbers sending investors to the safety of the greenbackEUR/USD hit 1.3123 during U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since April 16; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3153, declining 0.63%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3104, the low of April 23 and resistance at 1.3240, the session high. Dampening the enthusiasm for the greenback, U.S. payroll processing firm ADP reported non-farm employment increased by 119,000 in April, missing forecasts, after a 201,000 rise the previous month. Economists expected non-farm employment to rise by 178,000 in April. In additional bearish news Wednesday, a government report indicated that factory orders in the U.S. declined 1.5% in March, in line with expectations and following a 1.1% rise the previous month. Single currency sentiment weakened after final euro zone manufacturing data for April came in weaker-than-expected, with the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index slumping to a 34-month low of 45.9 in April, down from 47.7 in March and below the preliminary estimate of 46.0. German manufacturing output dropped at the fastest rate since July 2009, with its manufacturing PMI tumbling to 46.2, from 48.4 in March, while a separate report showed that the German unemployment rate also increased last month. Another economic report signaled that the unemployment rate in the euro zone climbed to a fresh record high of 10.9% in March. In Italy, government data indicated the unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 9.8% for March, the highest level since the current index began in 2004, from 9.3% the previous month. Meanwhile, investors remained nervous ahead of the ECB’s policy meeting on Thursday as well as weekend elections in Greece and France. The euro was trading close to a fresh 22-month low against the pound with EUR/GBP giving back 0.47%, to hit 0.8122. "

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3172, the low of April 25 and resistance at 1.3284, the day’s high. Fuelling the greenback’s rally, the U.S. Institute for Supply Management reported  the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index spiked to 54.8 in April, from 53.4 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to fall to 53.0 in April. The bullish data arrived on the heels of a series of weaker-than-expected U.S. economic reports sparking speculation over further stimulus measures by the Federal Reserve.  Meanwhile in China,  official data showed that an index of Chinese manufacturing activity rose to a 13-month high of 53.3 in April from 53.1 the previous month, but the data came in slightly below forecasts for a reading of 53.6. However,  the euro remained under pressure amid ongoing concerns over the outlook for the single currency bloc, after official data on Monday confirming that Spain’s economy entered a recession in the first quarter sparked fresh fears that austerity measures could impair economic growth in the region. Investors remained nervous ahead of weekend elections in Greece and France and the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. Elsewhere, the euro was higher against the pound with EUR/GBP traded lower by 0.01%, to hit 0.8154. Trading remained light as markets in France, Germany and Italy were closed due to national holidays. "

U.S. economic data indicated manufacturing activity in the Chicago area slowed significantly more-than-expected in April, while a separate report showed that consumer spending slowed last month. The Chicago purchasing managers’ index fell by 6.0 points to a seasonally adjusted 56.2 in April from a reading of 62.2 in March. That was the lowest reading since November 2009.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis said consumer spending rose by 0.3% in March, slowing from 0.9% the previous month, while incomes rose a better-than-expected 0.4%.

During U.S. trade, the dollar was down against the euro, with EUR/USD adding 0.25% to trade at 1.3253.  Depressing the greenback, the Gross Domestic Product numbers indicated that the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.2% rate in the first quarter, missing the 2.5% increase projected by economists, casting doubts on the economic growth. Adding to global growth concerns, S&P slashed Spain’s long term debt rating to BBB+ reporting that the outlook is negative in the face of the recession undermining efforts to cut the budget deficit. Additionally, the Spanish jobless rate spiked to 24.4%, hitting an eighteen year high, the National Statistics Institute reported. In U.S. dollar bullish news, the U.S. UoM consumer sentiment rose unexpectedly last month, data showed on Friday. In a report, the University of Michigan said that consumer sentiment rose to a seasonally adjusted 76.4, from 75.7 in the preceding month. Analysts had expected UoM consumer sentiment to remain unchanged at 75.7 last month. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.42% to 1.6252.  Elsewhere, the greenback was down against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY giving back 0.65% to hit 80.47 and USD/CHF easing dropping 0.33% to trade at 0.9059.  Meanwhile, in Japan, the central bank expanded its plan for government-bond purchases by 10 trillion yen to support the economy. On the pro global growth side, data indicated Switzerland’s KOF economic barometer rose more-than-expected to a seasonally adjusted 0.40 last month from 0.09 in the preceding month whose figure was revised up from 0.08. Analysts had expected the KOF economic barometer to rise to 0.26 last month. The greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD trading down 0.37% to trade at 0.9810, AUD/USD gaining 0.54% to hit 1.0445 and NZD/USD up 0.56% to hit 0.8192.

EUR/USD traded at 1.3227 during U.S. afternoon trade, climbing 0.08%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3105, Monday’s low, and resistance at 1.3263, today’s high. Earlier in the day, official data showed that U.S. Initial Jobless Claims fell less-than-expected to a seasonally adjusted 388K last week from 389K in the preceding week whose figure was revised up from 386K. Analysts had expected Initial Jobless Claims to fall to 375K last week. This news weighed on the greenback despite pending U.S. home purchases surging 4.1% in March to 101.4, the highest level since April, 2010. In the euro zone, the European Commission reported that an index of executive and consumer sentiment dropped to 92.8 from a revised 94.5 in March. Economists were expecting a slide to 94.2 adding to the negative euro region sentiment. In technical trading news, the JPMorgan Volatility Index for currencies plunged 9.20%, marking the lowest close since 2007. Low volatility creates opportunities in currencies with higher benchmark rates since the risk in such trades is that market moves will erase profits.

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was down against the euro, with EUR/USD adding 0.28% to hit 1.3193. The euro extended gains against the greenback as official data indicated that U.S. new home sales fell by 7.1% to a seasonally adjusted 328,000 units in March, only slightly better than expectations for a decline to 320,000. The data was reported after a release indicating  U.S. home prices fell to the lowest level since 2002 in February. Standard & Poor’s  Case-Shiller house price index fell at an annualized rate of 3.5% in February from a year earlier, compared to expectations for a 3.4% decline. The euro gathered support after an auction of Dutch government debt earlier in the day met with solid investor demand, but fears that the country could lose its triple-A credit rating lingered following the collapse of the government on Monday. Sentiment on the shared currency also remained fragile after an auction of Spanish bills saw the country’s short-term borrowing costs almost double, one day after Spain’s central bank confirmed that the country’s economy entered a recession in the first quarter. The greenback was hovering close to a five-month low against the broadly stronger pound, with GBP/USD easing up 0.04% to hit 1.6137. Official data showed that U.K. public sector borrowing rose more-than-expected last month, while the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio rose to a record high 8.3%. Sterling continued to remain supported by diminished expectations for another round of monetary easing by the Bank of England.  Elsewhere, the greenback slipped lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY dipping 0.02% to hit 81.16 and USD/CHF shedding 0.39% to hit 0.9099. The greenback was broadly weaker against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, USD/CAD  sliding 0.35% to hit 0.9878, AUD/USD dipping 0.04% to hit 1.0315 and NZD/USD adding 0.19% to hit 0.8145. In Canada, official data showed that retail sales declined for the first time in six months in February as new automobile sales fell sharply, while core retail sales rose less-than-expected. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.28% at 79.25. Also Tuesday, data showed that U.S. consumer confidence declined unexpectedly in April, moving further off February’s 12-month high. The Conference Board, a market research group said its index of consumer confidence ticked down to 69.2 from a downwardly revised reading of 69.5 in March.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.60% to hit 1.3139. The risk off trade started after Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s government was forced to resign after negotiations on its austerity budget for 2013 broke down. The news came one day after the first round of the French presidential election was won by Francois Hollande, who has pledged to challenge European leaders on their focus on austerity. Meanwhile, worries over the euro zone’s economic outlook weighed after data showed that the bloc’s manufacturing output slumped to its lowest level since June 2009 this month, while its services sector fell to a five month low. The decline was driven by poor performances in Germany and France, with manufacturing activity in Germany slowing to the lowest level in almost three years. The weak data added to fears that economic growth in the region will be hit by planned government austerity measures. The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD sliding 0.03% to hit 1.3118. On Friday, data indicated that U.K. retail sales posted the biggest jump in over a year in March, fuelling hopes that the economic recovery is gaining momentum and dampening expectations for a fresh round of monetary stimulus from the Bank of England while supporting the pound. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY dropping 0.49% to hit 81.11 and USD/CHF advancing 0.80% to hit 0.9161. The greenback strengthened against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD gaining 0.42% to hit 0.9962,AUD/USD falling 0.91% to hit 1.0284 and NZD/USD tumbling 1.01% to hit 0.8103. In Australia, government data indicated that producer price inflation fell unexpectedly in the first quarter, increasing expectations for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia at its policy meeting next week. Elsewhere, official data showed that Canadian wholesale sales rose unexpectedly in February, rebounding from the previous month’s steep decline. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.36% at 79.56. In other news Monday, the Bank of Spain reported it believes that the country’s economy has entered a recession.  The central bank said gross domestic product contracted by 0.4% in the three months to March. That follows a 0.3% contraction in the fourth quarter, and zero growth in the third quarter of last year."
1401,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2012 11:53AM ET</span>","Forex - EUR/USD plunges on growth worries, political concerns","Investing.com - The euro traded sharply lower against the U.S. dollar Monday, as Chinese growth concerns combined with political uncertainty in France and Netherlands sent investors fleeing to the safe haven greenback.EUR/USD hit 1.3105, the pair’s lowest since Thursday, then bounced to 1.3134 during U.S. afternoon trade, still down 0.64% The pair was likely to find support at 1.3068, Thursday’s low and resistance at 1.3209, the session high.Sentiment on the euro deteriorated after Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s government was forced to resign after negotiations on its austerity budget for 2013 broke down. In addition, French borrowing costs increased Monday, after President Nicolas Sarkozy poor performance against challenger Francois Hollande in the first round of the country’s presidential election. Hollande stated he wants to renegotiate the euro zone’s fiscal pact in order to stimulate growth in the bloc, rather than enforcing strict austerity measures. Meanwhile, worries over the economic outlook mounted after data showed that the euro zone's manufacturing output slumped to its lowest level since June 2009 this month, while its services sector fell to a five month low. The decline was driven by poor performances in Germany and France, with manufacturing activity in Germany slowing to the lowest level in almost three years. The weak data fuelled fears economic growth in the region will be hit by planned government austerity measures. An index signaled that Chinese manufacturing may shrink for the sixth straight month in April fostering fears of a continuing global economic slowdown.  The broadly weaker euro fell to a 20-month low against the pound, withEUR/GBP giving back 0.57% to hit 0.8150 and fell sharply against the yen, with EUR/JPY plunging 1.15% to hit 106.54.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was slightly higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.11% to hit 1.3112. The single currency limited losses amid speculation that Spanish banks were purchasing the currency prior to an auction of two and 10-year Spanish government bonds Thursday, as concerns over whether the government will be able to reduce one of the euro zone’s largest budget deficits in the face of a looming recession persisted. Euro sentiment was boosted on Tuesday after an auction of short-term Spanish government debt raised the full targeted amount of EUR3 billion, but the country’s borrowing costs almost doubled. Meanwhile, worries over Spain’s troubled banking sector mounted after the country’s central bank reported earlier that the amount of bad loans at domestic banks rose to an 18-year high in February. But the greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.67% to hit 1.6030. The pound was supported when the minutes of the Bank of England’s April meeting indicated that just one policymaker voted in favor of additional monetary easing, after two of the nine member monetary policy committee favored additional stimulus in March. Additionally, government data showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the U.K. rose less-than-expected last month, while the unemployment rate ticked down unexpectedly. Elsewhere, the greenback was up against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 0.57% to hit 81.30 and USD/CHF easing up 0.14% to hit 0.9164. In other news Wednesday, the Swiss National Bank named Thomas Jordan as president, three months after he took over as interim head of the SNB, following the resignation of former president Philipp Hildebrand. Traders did not expect his appointment to have and significant impact on the monetary policy strategy of the central bank. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.02% to hit 0.9897,AUD/USD slipping 0.16% to hit 1.0372 and NZD/USD shedding 0.43% to hit 0.8177. The Canadian dollar remained supported after the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy report struck a slightly more dovish tone than the bank’s rate statement on Tuesday. ""The heightened uncertainty around the global outlook has eased from very high levels, but volatility can be expected to persist,"" the BoC said. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up just 0.08% at 79.76. Additional euro positive news Wednesday includes Germany auctioned off EUR4.21 billion of two-year government bonds at a record low yield of 0.14%, as investor demand for safe haven assets remained well supported."
1485,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 18, 2012 12:16PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD mostly flat on Spanish auction anticipation,"Investing.com - The euro traded mostly flat against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, although it has bounced from the lows, as debt crisis fears in the euro zone dominated market sentiment prior to Thursday’s Spanish debt auction.EUR/USD traded at 1.3124 slipping just 0.02% in U.S. afternoon trade after bouncing from a low of 1.3059 earlier in the day. The pair was likely to find support at 1.2994, Monday’s low and a two-month low and resistance at 1.3140, the session high. The single currency weakened prior to Thursday’s critical auction of two and 10-year Spanish government bonds, amid uncertainty over whether the government will be able to reduce one of the euro zone’s largest budget deficits in the face of a looming recession. Market sentiment was boosted on Tuesday after an auction of short-term Spanish government debt raised the full targeted amount of EUR3 billion, but the country’s borrowing costs almost doubled. Meanwhile, concerns over Spain’s troubled banking sector mounted after the country’s central bank reported that the amount of bad loans at domestic banks rose to an 18-year high in February. Pressure on the euro continued as  concerns over Portugal’s economic health intensified after Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho stated Wednesday there were ""no guarantees"" that the country would meet its commitment to return to the international capital markets before September 2013. The euro was hovering close to a 19-month low against the stronger pound, with EUR/GBP tumbling 0.65% to hit 0.8190 but held gains against the  yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.53% to hit 106.68. In other news, Germany auctioned EUR4.21 billion of two-year government bonds at a record low yield of 0.14%, as investor demand for safe haven assets remained well supported."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar traded higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dipping 0.07% striking 1.3133. Earlier, the single currency had climbed to a two-day high against the greenback, after an auction of Spanish short-term government bonds saw the country raise the full targeted amount of EUR3 billion, but at sharply higher yields. In other euro bullish news data indicated German economic sentiment improved unexpectedly in April, climbing for the fifth consecutive month. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD gaining 0.23% to hit 1.5935. Sterling remained supported by diminished expectations for another round of easing from the Bank of England after official data showed that the consumer price index ticked up last month. The Office for National Statistics reported consumer price inflation increased to 3.5% year-on-year in March, in line with expectations after adding 3.4% the previous month. Elsewhere, the greenback was up against the yen, but was little changed against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY adding 0.33% to hit 80.67 and USD/CHF inching up 0.02% to hit 0.9147. Earlier Tuesday, Japan pledged to provide USD60 billion to the International Monetary Fund’s effort to expand its lending resources and shield the global economy against the effects of the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone. The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD tumbling 1.12% to hit 0.9881, AUD/USD rising 0.36% to hit 1.0392 and NZD/USD down 0.21% to hit 0.8193. The Canadian dollar rallied after the Bank of Canada said that higher interest rates “may become appropriate” as the economy gains momentum after it left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1% in a widely expected decision earlier. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was slightly lower, slipping 0.12% to hit 79.64. In the U.S., government data indicated  industrial production was unexpectedly flat for the second consecutive month in March, confounding expectations for a 0.3% increase. The report came after official data showed that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. increased unexpectedly in March, rising to the highest level since September 2008, while housing starts dropped to the lowest level in six months. The number of building permits issued last month rose 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted 0.747 million, confounding expectations for a modest decline of 0.7% to 0.710 million. U.S. housing starts fell to the lowest level since October, dropping 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted 0.654 million from a revised 0.694 million units in February. Economists had forecast housing starts to rise 1.0% in March to 0.705 million units."
1510,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2012 12:14PM ET</span>","EUR/USD lower despite positive German sentiment, mixed U.S. numbers","Investing.com - The euro traded lower against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, despite positive German economic sentiment numbers, on mixed U.S. economic data.EUR/USD hit a high of 1.3172 and subsequently dropped to 1.3123 in U.S. afternoon trade. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3032, the low of April 9 and resistance at 1.3172, the session high. In the U.S., government data indicated industrial production was unexpectedly flat for the second consecutive month in March, missing analyst’s expectations for a 0.3% increase. Additional government data showed that the  number of building permits issued in the U.S. surprisingly increased in March, rising to the highest level since September 2008, while housing starts dropped significantly, painting a mixed picture of the U.S. housing sector. The number of building permits issued last month climbed 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted 0.747 million, confounding expectations for a modest decline of 0.7% to 0.710 million. However, U.S. housing starts fell to the lowest level since October, dropping 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted 0.654 million from a revised 0.694 million units in February. Economists had forecast housing starts to rise 1.0% in March to 0.705 million units. Meanwhile in the euro zone,  the debt crisis eased after an auction of Spanish short-term government bonds saw the country raise the full targeted amount of EUR3 billion, but at sharply higher yields. Despite the positive signal, sentiment on the euro remained fragile amid uncertainty over whether Spain’s government can meet deficit reduction targets. Elsewhere, data showed that German economic sentiment improved unexpectedly in April, rising for the fifth consecutive month. The ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment increased to 23.4 in April from the previous month’s reading of 22.3. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 20.0. The euro was approaching a 19-month low against the broadly stronger pound, with EUR/GBP dropping 0.36% to hit 0.8237 and remained higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY up 0.24% to trade at 105.93. In other news, official data showed that the rate of consumer price inflation in the single currency bloc was 2.7% in March, up from a preliminary estimate of 2.6% and unchanged from February."

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar slipped against the euro with EUR/USD gaining 0.08% to 1.3087.  The greenback was bolstered as the U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in March, beating expectations for a modest 0.3% gain. However, February’s figure was revised to a 1.0% increase from a previously reported gain of 1.1%. In additional U.S. dollar bullish news, core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose by 0.8% last month, above expectations for a 0.6% gain, after rising by 0.9% in February. A separate report showed that an index of manufacturing conditions in New York deteriorated in April, growing at the slowest pace since November.  Hurting the greenback, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that its general business conditions index declined by 13.6 points to 6.6 in April from 20.2 in March.  Analysts had expected the index to decline by 2.2 points to 18.0 in April. Supporting the euro, official data reported that the euro zone posted an external trade surplus of EUR2.8 billion in February, against a deficit of EUR2.8 billion in the same month last year. Sentiment on the single currency remained muted as the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed above 6% after the cost of insuring the country’s sovereign debt against default rose to a record high, amid fears that Spain will be the next euro zone member to require a bailout. The greenback traded lower against the pound, with GBP/USD gaining 0.20% to 1.5880. Sterling remained supported after recent economic data indicated that the recovery in the U.K. is gaining momentum, easing concerns the Bank of England may implement fresh stimulus measures. Sentiment on the pound was also lifted after ratings agency Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its triple-A rating on the U.K. on Friday, stating the government will be able to stick to its austerity program. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, but was up against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY sliding 0.52% to hit 80.49 and USD/CHF adding 0.05% to hit 0.9199. In Switzerland, official data showed that the producer price index rose less-than-expected last month, climbing 0.3%, disappointing expectations for a 0.5% gain after increasing by 0.8% in February. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.15% to hit 1.0011, AUD/USD losing 0.16% to hit 1.0356 and NZD/USD dropping 0.39% to hit 0.8198. In Canada, official data showed that foreign securities purchases surged by CAD12.5 billion in February, exceeding expectations for a CAD4.23 billion rise and following a CAD4.28 billion decline the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was flat at 80.03. Also Monday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said that net foreign purchases of long-term securities totaled USD10.1 billion in February, down from purchases of USD102.4 billion in January, whose figure was revised up from a previously reported USD101.0 billion. Economists had expected Treasury International Capital purchases to total USD41.3 billion in February."

The greenback gained strength when fears of the ECB resuming its bond repurchase program were triggered as Spanish government bonds moved toward a second - straight weekly decline signaling the respite in the debt crisis created by the ECB’s unlimited three year loans program may be ending. German bunds, the euro zone benchmark government securities, advanced for the first time in three days. Adding to the single currency bearishness, seventeen of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast that the ECB will be forced to resume its Securities Market Program to contain bond yields. On Thursday, dampening greenback enthusiasm, the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose unexpectedly according to governmental data.. In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week rose to a seasonally adjusted 380K, from 367K in the preceding week whose figure was revised up from 357K. Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to fall to 355K last week. In addition, the U.S. trade balance fell less-than-expected last month. In a report, Bureau of Economic Analysis stated that U.S. trade balance dropped to a seasonally adjusted -46.0B, from -52.5B in the preceding month whose figure was revised up from -52.6B. Analysts had expected U.S. trade balance to fall -52.0B last month. A lack luster Chinese GDP also helped the risk off sentiment. China’s gross domestic product expanded just 8.1% from a year earlier in the first quarter, following an 8.9% advance in the last three months of 2011 adding to global growth fears and increasing safe haven buying in the greenback. The U.S. dollar was higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.12% to hit 1.5940.  On Thursday, U.K. official data showed that the goods trade deficit widened more than expected in February, as exports to countries outside the European Union dropped. The Office for National Statistics said the goods trade deficit widened to GBP8.8 billion compared with a forecast of GBP7.7 billion and up from GBP7.9 billion in January.  Meanwhile, the greenback was higher against the yen and against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY gaining 0.17% to hit 81.04 and USD/CHF adding 0.44% to hit 0.9153. In Japanese news Thursday, the governor of the Bank of Japan said the bank will pursue “powerful easing” to help overcome deflation and put the economy on a sustainable growth path. Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar was higher against its Canadian and Australian yet lower against New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD gaining 0.01% to hit 0.9940, AUD/USD falling 0.27% to hit 1.0410 and NZD/USD rising 0.14% to hit 0.8288. In Australia, the currency suffered on the dropping China GDP numbers as China is Australia’s largest trading partner.   The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.36% to trade at 79.75."

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3065, Wednesday’s low and short-term resistance at 1.3357, the high of March 31st. Fears of the ECB resuming its bond repurchase program were triggered as Spanish government bonds moved toward a second - straight weekly decline signaling the break in the debt crisis created by the ECB’s unlimited three year loans program may be ending. German bunds, the euro zone benchmark government securities, advanced for the first time in three days. Adding to the single currency bearishness, seventeen of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast that the ECB will be forced to resume its Securities Market Program to contain bond yields.On Thursday, dampening greenback enthusiasm, the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose unexpectedly according to governmental data.. In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week rose to a seasonally adjusted 380K, from 367K in the preceding week whose figure was revised up from 357K. Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to fall to 355K last week. In addition, the U.S. trade balance fell less-than-expected last month. In a report, Bureau of Economic Analysis stated that U.S. trade balance dropped to a seasonally adjusted -46.0B, from -52.5B in the preceding month whose figure was revised up from -52.6B. Analysts had expected U.S. trade balance to fall -52.0B last month.

Creating the risk on environment, Fed Vice Chairman, Janet Yellen lent support to the central bank’s stance that interest rates will remain low through 2014, since the goal of full employment was missed and inflations remains steady. Yellen stated, “I consider a highly accommodative policy stance to be appropriate in present circumstances.” Italy auctioned EUR2.88 billion of the EUR3 billion of three-year bonds on offer, at an average yield of 3.89% compared to 2.76% at a similar auction last month, amid persistent concerns over the risk of sovereign debt contagion from Spain. The euro had found support earlier after a senior European Central Bank official said Wednesday that the central bank still had its bond-buying program available as an option to ease pressure on Spanish bond yields. He added that the current level of market pressure on Spain was not justified given the reforms being undertaken by its government. Meanwhile, official data showed that industrial production in the euro zone rose unexpectedly in February, but the year-on-year fall was still the steepest since December 2009. Eurostat said that industrial production rose to a seasonally adjusted 0.5%, from 0.2% in the preceding month, defying expectations for a 0.3% decline. Industrial output dropped 1.8% in the year to February, in line with expectations. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.25% to hit 1.5948.  In the U.K., official data showed that the goods trade deficit widened more than expected in February, as exports to countries outside the European Union dropped. The Office for National Statistics said the goods trade deficit widened to GBP8.8 billion compared with a forecast of GBP7.7 billion and up from GBP7.9 billion in January.  Meanwhile, the greenback was higher against the yen, but lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY gaining 0.23% to hit 81.05 and USD/CHF giving back 0.21% to hit 0.9155. Earlier in the day, the governor of the Bank of Japan said the bank will pursue “powerful easing” to help overcome deflation and put the economy on a sustainable growth path. Elsewhere, the greenback was down against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD slipping 0.39% to hit 0.9999, AUD/USD jumping 0.93% to hit 1.0395 and NZD/USD rising 0.42% to hit 0.8213. In Australia, official data showed that the economy added 44,000 jobs in March, far better than forecasts for an increase of 6,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 5.2%, from 5.3% in February.   The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.59% to trade at 79.47. "

The risk on trade was sparked as the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds pulled away from four-month highs, but investors remained cautious amid concerns about the government's ability to cut its deficit.  Prime Mister Mariano Rajoy stated his country will not require a bailout and that the country’s deficit target remains “unconditional.”  Rajoy said that the government will push forward the program to tackle tax and employment fraud this month, as well as reforms in the banking and healthcare systems.Suporting the greenback, the Fed’s Beige Book report revealed that the economy maintained expansion in all 12 of it regions with manufacturing, hiring and retail sales showing signs of strength despite higher fuel costs. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.24% to hit 1.5900. In the U.K., a report showed that British retail sales advanced at their fastest pace so far this year last month, fuelling hopes that the economic recovery is gaining traction. The British Retail Consortium said like-for-like retail sales rose at an annualized rate of 1.3%, after declining by 0.3% in February. The greenback pulled back from a six-week low against the yen, but remained weaker against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY advancing 0.38% to hit 80.97 and USD/CHF shedding 0.30% to hit 0.9156. Earlier Wednesday, Japan’s finance minister said he was watching the yen’s movements with “great interest” after the currency hit a six-week high against the dollar. Elsewhere, the greenback was weaker against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand cousins, with USD/CAD sliding 0.20% to hit 1.0022,AUD/USD climbing 0.60% to hit 1.0309 and NZD/USD gaining 0.59% to hit 0.8197. In Canada, a report showed that housing starts rose unexpectedly in March, improving for the second consecutive month. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts rose to 216,000 units in March from an upwardly revised 205,000 units in February. Analysts had expected Canadian housing starts to dip to 200,000 units in March.

During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was modestly higher against the euro, with EUR/USD easing lower by 0.05% to hit 1.3099. Worries over high Spanish borrowing costs depressed the euro, as the yield on Spain’s 10-year government bonds ticked up to 5.9% from 5.8% earlier in the day, amid fears that the country will be the next in the euro zone to require a bailout. The increase in borrowing costs came despite reassurances from Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier that the country will cut its budget deficit to 3% of gross domestic product in 2013. Sentiment on the single currency was also hit after a report showed that investor sentiment in the euro zone dropped this month, after three successive monthly increases. The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD dropping 0.20% to hit 1.5860. Industry data indicated earlier that U.K. house prices declined at the slowest pace since June 2010 in March. In U.K. housing news, The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' seasonally adjusted house price balance rose to minus 10 from minus 13 in February, beating forecasts for a more modest rise to minus 12. The greenback was lower against the yen, but was slightly higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY falling 0.94% to hit 80.73 and USD/CHF rising 0.02% to hit 0.9174. Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan held its benchmark interest rate close to zero and left its JPY30 trillion yen asset-purchase fund unchanged, in a widely expected move. The central bank reported that no board member proposed additional easing at the two-day policy meeting, although investors expect fresh measures to be announced following the bank’s next policy meeting on April 27. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.46% to hit 1.0022, AUD/USD losing 0.34% to hit 1.0277 and NZD/USD dropping 0.76% to hit 0.8153. Sentiment on the growth-linked dollars was hit earlier after official data showed that Chinese imports declined sharply in March, dampening the outlook for global growth. China posted a trade surplus of USD5.35 billion last month, as imports grew just 5.3% after increasing by 39.6% in February. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, added 0.03% to hit 79.99. The outlook for the U.S. recovery remained clouded after government data on Friday showed that the economy added just 120,000 jobs in March, the lowest number since December and well below expectations for a 203,000 increase. At a conference earlier in the day, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. economy was “still far from having fully recovered” from the financial crisis."

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3003, the low of March 15 and resistance at 1.3163, the high of April 3rd.  Starting the weakness in the greenback, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by 120,000 in March, the lowest since December and well below expectations for a 203,000 increase. It was the first time since November that hiring failed to top the 200,000 level, renewing concerns over the health of the U.S. economy. The unemployment rate plunged to 8.2%, the lowest since January 2009, from 8.3% in February. However, the data showed that the decline stemmed entirely from people dropping out of the labor force. The disappointing data cast doubts over the strength of the U.S. economic recovery and revived expectations that the Federal Reserve may conduct a third round of monetary easing to bolster growth. However sentiment on the euro remained downbeat after disappointing auction of Spanish government debt last week saw the country’s borrowing costs rise, sparking fears that the country may be the next in the euro zone to require a bailout. The euro was also lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP sliding 0.02% to hit 0.8249 and EUR/JPY giving back 0.10% to hit 106.80. Trading volumes were expected to stay light on Monday, with markets in the U.K. and the euro zone closed due to the Easter holidays."

1693,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 06, 2012 07:47AM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD trading flat pre non farm payrolls,"Investing.com - The euro traded flat to higher in early U.S. trade Friday as investors await the critical U.S. non farm payroll number and Spanish concerns weigh.EUR/USD moved in a tight range, in light holiday trade between a low of 1.3054 and a high of 1.3078 while trading up 1.3069 up 0.02% at the time of this writing. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3048, the low of March 16 and resistance at 1.3238, the session high. Anticipation is high for the release of U.S. non farm payrolls at 8:30 am New York time before many traders take off for the long Easter holiday weekend. Analyst’s are expecting U.S. non farm payrolls to increase by 205,000 based on the ADP report Wednesday. The jobless rate is forecasted to have held a three year low of 8.3% in a separate report released today. Investors can anticipate strength to be supported in the greenback should these figures be exceeded when the data is released. Sentiment on the euro was hit by concerns over the debt crisis in the euro zone, after a poorly received auction of Spanish government debt earlier saw the country’s borrowing costs rise. Spain’s Treasury auctioned EUR2.59 billon of government bonds, short of the maximum targeted amount of EUR3.5 billion, in the country’s first debt auction since last week’s austerity budget. Following the auction, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed to 5.7%, up from 5.5% before the sale. On Tuesday, Spain’s government announced that the country’s public debt will rise to a record 79.8% of gross domestic product this year. These results forced Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy to state that the economy is in extreme difficulty thus raising the spectre of a possible bailout. Meanwhile, concerns over the outlook for growth in the euro zone mounted following a flurry of weak economic data earlier in the week. Government data confirmed that the euro zone service sector contracted for the sixth time in seven months in March, increasing the likelihood that the economy has entered a technical recession. The final euro zone services purchasing managers’ index was revised up to 49.2 in March, from a preliminary estimate of 48.7, but remained below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion. A separate report showed that euro zone retail sales fell by 0.1% in February, against expectations for a 0.1% increase and were 2.1% lower year-on-year. The euro traded higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY climbing 0.04% to hit 107.59 but weaker against the pound, with EUR/GBP giving back 0.12% to hit 0.8246. "
