 * Parliament leaders to meet at 1000 GMT
 
 By Shrikesh Laxmidas
 LISBON, March 22 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliamentary
leaders will meet on Tuesday to decide on a vote on the
government's latest austerity measures, which could prompt the
collapse of the minority Socialist government.
Prime Minister Jose Socrates has threatened to resign if the
opposition fails to approve the measures. The main opposition
Social Democrats (PSD) are refusing to back them and have begun
to talk about possible snap elections, complicating the
country's drive to avoid a bailout.
 ""It is inevitable that the Portuguese people have the final
say,"" PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho said late on Monday, adding
that the country needs a broad coalition after elections to
solve its problems.
 Parliamentary bench leaders will meet at 1000 GMT to decide
when to vote on the austerity measures, which is most likely to
be on Wednesday.
 The government hopes to obtain support for its plan before a
key European summit gathers on Thursday to approve a beefed-up
euro zone rescue fund.
 Some analysts have said that markets have begun to price in
a change of government.
 Investors have long seen Portugal's request for a bailout as
a certainty, and analysts say a change of government is unlikely
to make much difference, given that the Social Democrats are
expected to stay the austerity course.
 Ricardo Salgado, chief executive of the country's second
largest listed bank, Banco Espirito Santo , appealed for
an understanding between the government and Social Democrats.
 ""An agreement between the two main parties seems to me
essential for Portugal to be able to get out of the crisis,"" he
told business daily Jornal de Negocios in an interview published
on Tuesday.
 Passos Coelho said his party did not rule out following
Greece and Ireland in requesting an international bailout if it
came to power, if such a request were inevitable for Portugal to
recover from its difficult economic situation.
 The government on Monday presented to parliament its latest
economic plan, including broad economic outlines for the coming
year and showed that for the first time the government now
expects there to be a recession in 2011 as most economists have
forecast.
 The document predicted a contraction of 0.9 percent in gross
domestic product this year compared with the previous estimate
of 0.2 percent growth.
 The government said it remains open to talks on the
measures, which include further spending cuts to ensure it can
reach the target of cutting the public deficit to 4.6 percent of
gross domestic product after beating last year's goal of 7.3
percent.
 Portugal's bond yields have soared during the year-long
sovereign debt crisis with the yield on its benchmark 10-year
bond  hitting euro lifetime highs of around 7.8
percent earlier this month. 
 The yield was at 7.6 percent on Tuesday and the spread to
safer German Bunds was unchanged at 432 basis points.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - The euro rose to its highest in
four-and-a-half months against the dollar on Tuesday, buoyed by
expectations the European Central Bank will raise interest rates
next month, prompting demand from real money accounts.
 The yen steadied, staying in a narrow range against the
dollar, with traders wary of pushing the Japanese currency much
higher due to concerns about possible additional G7 intervention
to prevent further appreciation.
 The euro was on track to test its November high of $1.4283
after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet and other ECB
policymakers reiterated their stance that they are ready to act
quickly to guard against inflation.
 However, traders said a barrier at $1.4250 could stem its
gains in the near term.
 Gains in the single currency pushed the dollar to its lowest
in 15 months against a basket of currencies, the greenback
staying under pressure on the view that the U.S. will keep
monetary policy loose while other central banks look to tighten.
 ""Euro/dollar is supported after Trichet continued to signal
a rate hike in April and by developments in yields,"" said Mic
Ingenuus, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""A test of the $1.4283 level is extremely likely in the next
couple of days, if not today"".
 German two-year bond yields pushed higher as the ECB showed
no signs of backing away from a rate rise next month.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.4237, having hit a high of
$1.4246 on EBS trading systems, its strongest since early
November, while the dollar index fell as low as 75.302, its
weakest since December 2009. 
 Traders cited real money demand for euros and said there
were stops at $1.4250 and $1.4285.
 Sterling also hit its highest in more than a year against
the dollar ahead of data at 0930 GMT which is expected to show a
further rise in UK inflation.
 
 INTERVENTION WATCH
 Traders said a massive build-up of offers to sell dollars
against the yen may test whether Japanese authorities have a
line in the sand at 80 in dollar/yen to launch intervention.
 They said selling interest was particularly strong, starting
from 82.00 yen -- the dollar's high against the yen after
Friday's joint intervention.
 The dollar was steady against the yen at 81.05 yen, having
earlier dipped on reported selling above 81.00 by Japanese
exporters. Traders said stop-loss orders were building below
80.50, but wariness about possible intervention was keeping it
trapped in a narrow range for now. One trader cited dollar
offers from investors at 82.00 yen and above, while a customer
dealer at a major Japanese bank said the amount of dollar offers
around the 82-yen and 83-yen area hase increased sharply in the
past few days.
 The customer dealer said the amount of such dollar offers at
his bank had doubled after a bunch of option triggers were taken
out last Thursday, when the dollar slid to a post-World War Two
record low of 76.25 yen.
 Japanese exporters may gradually lower their dollar offers,
given market expectations that authorities are likely aiming to
prevent the dollar from dropping below 80.00 yen rather than
pushing it higher, the customer dealer added.
 Yen volatility has eased significantly since late last week,
and some analysts said calmer markets in the coming weeks would
decrease the need for Tokyo to smooth any appreciation in the
Japanese currency, even if the dollar creeps below 80 yen.
 ""If we get past the end of the financial year (at end-March)
and we're still unclear about the marcoeconomic damage from
Japan's earthquake and dollar/yen slides even more, beyond a
one-month window it will be difficult for the BoJ to do a whole
lot more,"" said Cliff Tan, Asia FX strategist at Societe
Generale in Hong Kong.
 The euro edged up 0.15 percent to 115.47 yen.

 * Sanofi shares down 0.1 percent

(Adds analyst, Lilly, source on concerns, overlaps, advisers)
 By James Regan and Quentin Webb
 PARIS/LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Regulatory pressure
prompted Sanofi-Aventis and Merck & Co to abandon plans for a
joint animal health powerhouse with $5 billion in sales.
 The move sets back the French and U.S. drugmakers' plans to
achieve economies of scale in the consolidating animal care
industry, and comes a month after they delayed the long-running
deal's closing by another six months.
 It is also a blow to companies that had hoped to snap up
assets with about $500 million in annual revenue that the pair
would have had to sell to clear regulatory hurdles.
 Merck and Sanofi said a year ago they planned to combine
their veterinary drugs and vaccines businesses to create a joint
venture with almost a third of the global market.
 The duo were due to merge Sanofi's pet-focused Merial unit,
which they once jointly owned, with Merck's bigger,
livestock-oriented Intervet business, relegating Pfizer to
second place in the animal health industry.
 WestLB analyst Oliver Kaemmerer said the decision was an
""unpleasant surprise"" that would deprive the duo of synergies
and a likely boost to earnings.
 A person familiar with the matter said U.S. and European
regulators had taken an increasingly tough stance, partly
because of concerns that previous sell-offs, as in Pfizer's
tie-up with Wyeth, had struggled to safeguard competition.
 ""The companies are discontinuing their agreement primarily
because of the increasing complexity of implementing the
proposed transaction,"" the companies said in a joint statement
on Tuesday.
 This is ""both in terms of the nature and extent of the
anticipated divestitures and the length of time necessary for
the worldwide regulatory review process,"" they said.
 Both companies added that they remained committed to their
animal health businesses, which generated annual sales of $2.6
billion for Sanofi and $2.9 billion for Merck & Co in 2010.
 Last year Vetnosis, a consultancy, identified portfolio
overlaps in vaccines for livestock, poultry, pets and horses; in
products to kill parasites; and in specialty veterinary
products, such as drugs to treat cardiovascular disorders.
 In October, two people familiar with the matter said the
disposals could fetch about 1.5 to 2.5 times sales -- or about
$750 million to $1.25 billion.
 
 BIDDERS
 Germany's Bayer AG, unlisted domestic rival Boehringer
Ingelheim and Switzerland's Novartis had previously made it
through to the second round of bidding for Merck and Sanofi
assets being sold as part of the venture, several sources close
to the bidders had said.
 Eli Lilly and Co, the sixth-biggest U.S. drugmaker by market
value, was also preparing a bid, people familiar with the matter
said. Last week Lilly's Elanco unit bought Johnson & Johnson's
animal health business, a deal that one person familiar with
the matter said was worth about $300 million.
 Further consolidation could yet come in the sector, where
Pfizer is keen to grow and Novartis has not yet reached a
critical size, Oddo Securities analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur said.
""This leaves open the field of possibilities,"" he said.
 Shares in Sanofi were 0.1 percent lower at 47.94 euros at
1051 GMT, while the French blue-chip CAC 40 index was up 0.2
percent.
 Morgan Stanley advised on the disposals, people familiar
with the matter have said. A quartet of law firms -- Linklaters;
Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton; Howrey; and Weil, Gotshal &
Manges provided legal advice, the first person familiar with the
matter said.

 BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas
Sarkozy is expected to attend a G20 seminar on reshaping the
global monetary system later this month in Nanjing, the Chinese
Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.	
 ""It's my understanding that President Sarkozy will attend
this seminar, and will meet Chinese leaders,"" ministry
spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a regular news briefing.	
 ""This seminar is an informal, academic one,"" Jiang said.	
 Paris has placed discussion of how to reform the
international monetary system at the centre of its year-long
presidency of the G20, and China's position will be key for how
much progress France can make on its goals.	
 China's Foreign Ministry said last week that China's
exchange rate would not be a topic for discussion in Nanjing.

 The gathering in the eastern Chinese city on March 31 is
expected to include academics, economists, central bankers and
finance ministers.	
 France will also send Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and
central bank Governor Christian Noyer to the one-day meeting,
French officials say.	
 Paris is still liaising with G20 partners over how many
ministers and central bankers from other countries will attend
the seminar.	
 As G20 chair, France is also seeking measures to address
volatility in commodity prices and to complete a framework for
tackling global economic imbalances, such as China's large
current account surplus and Washington's big fiscal deficit.	
 At a G20 summit in Paris last month, China was reluctant to
include exchange rates and currency reserves in a list of
indicators to be used to gauge imbalances, making a hard-fought
compromise necessary for finance ministers to eventually reach a
deal.

 * Conditions deteriorate in cramped evacuation centres
 * Work starts on rebuilding roads, temporary homes

 By Jon Herskovitz	
 KESENNUMA, Japan, March 22 (Reuters) - Fuel shortages, icy
rain and power outages are hampering Japan's worst humanitarian
crisis since World War Two, but relief workers are reporting
some progress as mangled roads are reopened and new homes built.	
 The sheer numbers in the world's costliest natural disaster
-- estimated at $250 billion -- remain staggering. There are
about 21,000 dead or missing, 319,000 people evacuated, 2,131
makeshift shelters, 2.4 million people without access to water
and 221,000 households without power.	
 ""There is some improvement in terms of logistics and in
getting food and other supplies,"" said Francis Markus of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
delegation in Tokyo.	
 ""But it is still very difficult.""	
 Rain grounded helicopters delivering relief supplies this
week, forcing authorities to rely on roads and delaying aid,
said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs. Access to water ""remains a concern"" in 11 prefectures,
it added.	
 Makeshift evacuation centres, packed with hundreds of
shell-shocked survivors sleeping side-by-side for more than a
week, are orderly but clearly deteriorating in some regions,
beset by cases of diarrhea, influenza, stress and fatigue.	
 ""The only thing we can do is stick it out,"" said Takeshi
Murakami, 67, in Kesennuma in devastated Miyagi prefecture whose
governor reckons as many as 15,000 people were killed by the
March 11 quake and tsunami. 
 Murakami is staying in a school gym with about 450 others,
down from a peak of about 800 people last week. Hastily gathered
possessions are folded in tidy bundles next to sleeping bags.
Most escaped only with the clothes on their back. Few have
bathed since the 9.0 tremor. 
 Sleep at the shelter is often interrupted by the screams of
an Alzheimer sufferer during the night. Evacuees use portable
toilets outside the gym. In one section, the elderly lie on mats
on the wooden floor, receiving intravenous drips. 
 Telephone companies provide free services at the gym, where
an entire wall is jammed with notices posted by people seeking
help to find the missing. Without television, there is little to
do but talk, grieve and wait. Many huddle around heaters.	
 ""There is no privacy but you have to get used to it,"" said
Keiichi Kato, 49, who ran a children clothing's store before it
was obliterated, replaced by four washed up fishing trawlers.	
 
 
 SLOW PROGRESS 
 There is progress. The Tohoku Expressway connecting Tokyo
with quake-hit areas has re-opened to trucks. In Rikuzentakata,
where more than 80 percent of the estimated 8,000 households
were swept away, temporary homes are now being built.	
 About 5.5 million meals, 380,000 blankets and 90,000 diapers
had been distributed across the tsunami-ravaged region as of
Monday, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.	
 But it was unclear how many people these had reached.	
 An official at the Disaster Relief Headquarters in northern
Iwate prefecture, where 45,687 people were living in evacuation
centres as of Monday, said a shortage of fuel was preventing aid
from reaching hard-hit remote areas.	
 ""Relief goods are being sent to evacuation centres but
because of a shortage of fuel there's certainly not enough and
there are places that goods are not reaching,"" he said. 
 ""There are many places without electricity,"" he added. ""Some
people (in evacuation centres) are becoming ill.""	
 The U.N. humanitarian office reported trouble caring for the
disabled, especially the hearing impaired who in high-tech Japan
rely on e-mails sent by mobile phone to communicate. Much of the
mobile phone network remains down.	
 ""The psychological toll on those who survived the disaster
and are now in evacuation centres is becoming more apparent.
Many evacuees, including children, are suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorders,"" the U.N. agency said.	
 It is unclear how long people will stay in the shelters. An
exasperated Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi, last week asked
earthquake and tsunami victims to leave the prefecture due to a
shortage in housing. Some are quietly heeding his call.	
 About 10,000 people, on average, are leaving evacuation
centres a day, according to U.N. data. The Red Cross's Markus
said many are heading to homes of people not affected by the
disaster who have offered to take in survivors.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Japanese shares jumped over 4
percent on Tuesday and government bond futures slipped as
reports of progress in containing radiation leaks at a quake-hit
nuclear power plant prompted investors to pile back into risky
assets.	
 As Tokyo markets reopened after a long weekend, the yen
edged up but remained well below a record high that prompted the
world's major central banks to intervene on Friday for the first
time since 2000, using an estimated $30-35 billion.	
 Technicians at the Fukushima nuclear plant have attached
power cables to all six reactors and started a pump at one of
them to cool overheating nuclear fuel rods. 
 This encouraged investors to buy back domestic shares,
enticed by last week's 10 percent fall in the Nikkei, and
generate trading volume in the market's first section of biggest
stocks that was twice the 2011 levels ahead of the March 11
quake.	
 ""The problem of nuclear leakage appears to be moving in the
right direction, which is... helping shares,"" said Ryosuke
Okazaki, chief investment officer at ITC Investment Partners.	
 ""But at the moment, there are too many uncertainties. We
still need to analyse the impact of the nuclear leakage problem
and the outlook for power shortages in the long run.""	
 The Nikkei closed up 4.4 percent at 9,608.32 points,
popping above the key 9,500 level. The next chart-based
resistance is seen at the 200-day moving average around 9,826,
more than 2 percent above the closing level.	
 The Nikkei slumped as much as 20 percent to a near two-year
low as Japan's disaster and nuclear crisis unfolded last week.
The volatile trading included the biggest two-day decline since
October 1987.	
 The index has gained nearly 17 percent since the low and it
remains 6 percent below the close of March 11 when the
earthquake and tsunami struck.	
 
 Tuesday's buying was led by foreign investors. Their ""buy""
block orders placed before the market opened were 10 times the
average level, said Hideyuki Ishiguro, assistant manager at
Okasan Securities.	
 Wakachiku Construction , Toyo Construction and
and Nittoc Construction all rose more than 40
percent, to be the biggest percentage gainers on the first
section of the market, on reconstruction hopes. 
 
 NIKKEI VALUATION	
 Cheap valuations attracted buyers.	
 Thomson Reuters StarMine showed the Nikkei 225 components
were trading with a price-to-book ratio of 1.1, half the ratio
of the S&P 500 index .	
 The financial, utility and energy sectors were seen as
cheapest, with their price-to-book ratios at or below 1.	
 ""Global value funds together with long-only investors are
piling right in the middle of the index today, chasing big,
liquid stocks attracted by cheap valuations,"" said Tetsuro Ii,
chief executive officer of Commons Asset Management.	
 Electronics giant Toshiba rose nearly 13 percent
after the Nikkei business daily said it planned to pay a fiscal
year-end dividend of at least 2 yen per share, its first in
three years. 
 Nikkei futures in Chicago were up 3.2 percent at
9,540, while Osaka futures added 4.4 percent to 9,530.
The broader TOPIX index rose 4.5 percent to 868.13.	
 Roughly 3.7 billion shares changed hands on the Tokyo
bourse's first section, almost twice the daily average volume
this year before the quake.	
 
 YEN BELOW RECORD HIGH	
 The yen was slightly stronger against the dollar and euro,
although investors wary of further intervention were reluctant
to push it closer to 80 per dollar.	
 The yen was up 0.15 percent at 80.88 per dollar . It
hit a record high of 76.25 last week before the intervention
knocked it back to 82.00. 
 Benchmark Japanese government 10-year bond futures
fell 0.34 point to 139.40 in what participants described as thin
trading.	
 An uncertain outlook for the fiscal cost of the quake,
tsunami and nuclear crisis is one reason debt investors are
staying on the sidelines.	
 Kyodo news agency quoted national policy minister Koichiro
Gemba as saying that the government may need three extra budgets
in the fiscal year starting in April.	
 The economic damage of the disaster could hit as much as
$200 billion, exceeding that of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, a
factor which would weigh on debt prices.	
 ""Investors are also on the sideline as this is near fiscal
year end... I expect investors to watch the situation in the
market and may buy on dips,"" said head of rates at a U.S.
brokerage in Tokyo.	
 The 10-year yield on the cash bond was up 4
basis points at 1.245 percent.	
 The Bank of Japan offered to inject 2 trillion yen of cash
in same-day operations to stabilise the money market, extending
its offer for six business days in a row and providing further
support to general risk appetite.	
 As a result, current account deposits at the BOJ are
expected to rise to a record high of 43.6 trillion yen,
exceeding the levels of March 2004 when the central bank had
adopted an ultra-loose monetary policy of quantitative easing.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Naomi Tajitsu	
 SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, March 22 (Reuters) - The yen edged
higher on Tuesday, and some traders say a massive build-up of
offers to sell dollars may test whether Japanese authorities
have a line in the sand at 80 for the USD/JPY to launch
intervention.	
 The dollar looked vulnerable on charts following its recent
drop below trendline support against a basket of currencies. The
euro made the most of the dollar's woes, hovering near its
highest in more than four months against the greenback. 
 Traders said various market players were looking to sell the
dollar against the yen on rallies, with selling interest
particularly strong starting from 82.00 yen -- the dollar's high
against the yen after Friday's joint intervention.	
 One trader cited dollar offers from investors at 82.00 yen
and above, while a customer dealer at a major Japanese bank said
the amount of dollar offers around the 82-yen and 83-yen area
have increased sharply in the past few days.	
 The customer dealer said the amount of such dollar offers at
his bank had doubled after a bunch of option triggers were taken
out last Thursday, when the dollar slid to a post-World War Two
record low of 76.25 yen.	
 That surge in the yen prompted Japan and other Group of
Seven industrialised nations to intervene to sell the yen last
Friday, and investors are bracing for the possibility of further
action if the yen rises again. 
 ""The size (of the offers) is pretty substantial and makes me
wonder if it's really alright for one bank to have so much,""
said the customer dealer for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 The same dealer said last week that players including some
Japanese importers and smaller banks were left holding unwanted
dollar longs or pricey dollar longs after option triggers linked
to FX derivatives were struck as the yen soared last Thursday.	
 Japanese exporters may gradually lower their dollar offers,
given market expectations that authorities are likely aiming to
prevent the dollar from dropping below 80.00 yen rather than
pushing it higher, the customer dealer added.	
 Yen volatility has eased significantly since late last week,
and some analysts said calmer markets in the coming weeks would
decrease the need for Tokyo to smooth any appreciation in the
Japanese currency, even if the dollar creeps below 80 yen.	
 ""If we get past the end of the financial year (at end-March)
and we're still unclear about the marcoeconomic damage from
Japan's earthquake and dollar/yen slides even more, beyond a
one-month window it will be difficult for the BoJ to do a whole
lot more,"" said Cliff Tan, Asia FX strategist at Societe
Generale in Hong Kong.	
 The dollar dipped slightly against the yen compared to late
U.S. trade on Monday and stood at 80.90 yen , near a
session low around 80.85 yen.	
 The yen was broadly higher on the crosses, with the euro
dipping 0.2 percent to 115.07 yen .

 The yen's surge last week was fuelled in part by speculation
that Japanese insurers may repatriate funds from abroad to
secure cash for payments to policyholders, in the wake of the
massive earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on March 11.	
 Market players say such repatriation by insurers has not
occurred, and the impact of any such repatriation is unlikely to
be large. 
 The true scale of Friday's joint intervention is not yet
clear though market estimates put it around $30-35 billion-worth
of yen sales, mostly by the Bank of Japan.	
 Dollar/yen implied volatility has retreated in the
wake of the surge seen after last week's massive yen selling.
One-month vol was around 11.0-12.0 percent, steadying from a
pullback from around 20 percent on Thursday.	
 Lower volatility has provided some opportunity to take on
long gamma positions, but traders say the market remains short
gamma, leaving options dealers vulnerable to a renewed drop in
spot dollar/yen. 
 
 DXY BELOW TRENDLINE SUPPORT	
 The euro held steady at $1.4221 , hovering near
Monday's peak around $1.4241 on trading platform EBS, its
highest since November.	
 Euro bulls eyed the $1.4283 peak from November, but traders
said U.S. funds were looming with offers above that level, which
along with chart resistance was capping the euro's upside.	
 The U.S. currency struggled broadly, keeping the index
at 75.567, near a 15-month low of 75.340 hit on Monday.
It has broken below 75.631, a low hit after the Federal Reserve
announced a second round of quantitative easing in November. 
 It was also under trend line support off the 2008, 2009 and
2010 lows and threatening the 2009 trough at 74.170, which some
analysts said suggested a long-term reversal of a bullish trend.	
 Traders linked the dollar's weakness in part to expectations
the Fed would maintain its super-loose policy for a long time to
come, making it safe to borrow in dollars to fund carry trades.	
 In contrast, officials at the European Central Bank were
chorusing the dangers of inflation and seemed intent on raising
rates no matter the global uncertainties. 
 EU leaders also took a step closer to agreeing a new
European Stability Mechanism worth 500 billion euros which would
be able to directly buy government paper .

 ""Three-month FRA (forward rate agreements) price in rate
increases of around 100 basis points in a one-year horizon. In
my opinion the markets may be overestimating the necessary size
of the increases,"" the governor said.
 His comments echoed those of Miroslaw Gronicki, an adviser
to Belka, who told Reuters in an interview published on Monday
that rate hikes totalling 100 basis points would only be
required in the event of large capital outflows. [ID:nSLALEE7R]
 Belka said one of the key factors for the Polish monetary
council, the MPC,will be decisions of the European Central
Bank.
 ""It is assumed that the ECB will raise rates only at the
end of the year, but if the decision comes earlier, it will
change the inflation projection (in Poland) and prompt an
earlier interest rate increase,"" the governor said.
 Expectations for a higher scale of monetary tightening in
Poland have eased somewhat after recent data showed inflation
remained flat at 3.6 percent on an annual basis in February,
while wages grew by a much less-than-expected 4.1 percent.
 TAKING LONG VIEW
 Belka said the central bank should not react to monthly
data and should consider the long-term outlook.
 ""We should evaluate the situation in a longer perspective.
The economic rebound is continuing, but not every piece of
recent data is good enough,"" he said.
 The 9x12 forward rate agreements  now point to rate
increases totalling 95 basis points.
 On the Polish zloty , Belka said its recent
weakening would prove temporary.
 ""We are already observing the zloty rebound,"" he said,
though he added that the currency was unlikely to appreciate
quickly in the near future.
 The zloty hit 3-½ month lows last week, but has trimmed
some losses and is now traded at around 4.03 to the euro.
 The central bank's MPC raised interest rates by 25 basis
points to 3.75 percent in January at the start of a new
tightening cycle and is expected to increase borrowing costs by
another quarter of percentage point in April.
 Belka, who has the casting vote within the 10-strong MPC,
opposed a rate hike in each month in the September-December
period last year, but voted for a hike in January. The MPC did
not meet in February and it left rates steady in March.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2011 03:04AM ET</span>",Australia weighs nuclear push after Japan crisis," By Rob Taylor	
 CANBERRA, March 22 (Reuters) - Japan's nuclear crisis
threatens to derail a political push by Australia's government
to overturn a ban on selling uranium to India, as well as a
drive to use nuclear power domestically to counter climate
change.	
 Prime Minister Julia Gillard's minority Labor government is
planning a debate at a rare policy-making conference later this
year on nuclear energy and relaxing a long-standing bar on
uranium exports to New Delhi. 
 Resources Minister Martin Ferguson told Reuters this month
that he would press to modify prohibitions on uranium exports to
countries which have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty that would allow sales of the nuclear fuel to India.	
 But Gillard, who relies on Greens opposed to nuclear energy
to remain in power, said on Tuesday the events in Japan would
trigger a global debate on nuclear energy. 
 Gillard added she did not personally believe Australia
needed nuclear power plants. ""I don't see nuclear energy as part
of our future,"" she said in Melbourne.	
 ""We are blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy,
of clean energy, of solar, wind, tide, hot rocks. That's our
future, not nuclear, a clean energy future with carbon pricing
as part of it.""	
 
 With support now wobbling for the government and a new
Essential Media poll this week showing 53 percent of Australians
opposed to nuclear power at home, analysts said the debate could
prove toxic for Gillard's fragile grip on government.	
 ""It may well prove unrealistic and unreasonable to now
expect Julia Gillard's minority government to expend substantial
political capital on any issue which contains the words
'nuclear' or 'uranium',"" said analyst Rory Medcalf of the Lowy
Institute for International Policy.	
 New Delhi has long complained about Australia's uranium
policy as it seeks access to nuclear supplies for its booming
electricity sector and growing economy. Australia expects India
to build five new nuclear reactors by 2016.	
 
 DOMESTIC NUCLEAR POWER	
 At the same time, some prominent lawmakers and business
leaders are calling for a domestic nuclear power industry to
help curb Australia's greenhouse emissions, which per capita are
the world's highest due to reliance on coal-fired electricity.	
 Proponents include former conservative prime minister John
Howard, deputy opposition leader Julie Bishop, prominent local
entrepreneur Dick Smith, Australian Workers' Union chief Paul
Howes and former Labor Party president Warren Mundine.	
 Australia has almost 40 percent of the world's known uranium
reserves, but supplies only 19 pct of the world market.
Australia has no nuclear power stations.	
 The country at present has only three mines, BHP Billiton's
Olympic Dam, the world's biggest uranium mine,
Energy Resources Australia's Ranger mine in the
Northern Territory, and the Beverly mine, owned by U.S. company
General Atomics.	
 Medcalf said even if Canberra proceeded to sell uranium to
new markets, such as India or the United Arab Emirates, there
could well be political pressure to add strong environmental
conditions.	
 Those conditions could add even more complexity, and
potentially costs, to bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements
focused previously on the spread of nuclear weapons.	
 ""Australians will note also that the Fukushima disaster is
prompting India to review its own nuclear safety. Following the
crisis in Japan, and in the glare of the Indian media, the
intended expansion of India's nuclear footprint may well slow or
even stall,"" Medcalf said.	
 Australia has 22 bilateral nuclear safeguard agreements,
which allow exports to 39 countries. 
In recent years, Canberra has signed agreements with Russia
and China, and has already sent its first shipments of uranium
to China, where uranium consumption is projected to grow by 44
percent to 18,000 tonnes by 2016.	
 At a uranium conference in South Australia state, Australian
Uranium Association chief executive Michael Angwin said the
economic factors driving countries to nuclear power use were
unchanged by the Japan emergency.	
 ""Countries turn to nuclear energy because they wish to
improve their energy security and expand their electricity
generating capacity in a way that does not increase their carbon
emissions. That remains the case,"" Angwin said.	
 Australia's uranium exports in the year to July 1, 2011 are
forecast at 8,700 tonnes, up 21 percent on the previous year,
with production set to expand an average 15 percent per year to
July 2016 as several new mines set to start production.

 TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investor
sentiment towards domestic stocks hit its lowest since November
after the devastating earthquake and tsunami sparked a nuclear
crisis, but it remained well above an all-time low, a special
Reuters survey showed.	
 The benchmark Nikkei average tumbled 10 percent last
week after the natural disasters triggered radiation leaks at a
nuclear plant and threatened the immediate outlook for the
world's third-largest economy.	
 But though investors remained pessimistic about the outlook
for domestic shares, they were not nearly as bearish as in early
2009, when the global economy was still squeezed by the
aftermath of the U.S. sub-prime loan crisis.	
 The poll also showed deep disapproval of Prime Minister
Naoto Kan's handling of the ongoing nuclear crisis, and a desire
to scale back construction of new nuclear plants.	
 A large majority of those polled also said they believed the
crisis could be a turning point for Japan, jolting it from
decades of economic and political stagnation. 
 ""Over the long term, I hope for a revival of Japan, but it's
hard to know what will happen with the nuclear accident,"" said
one investor in his 20s, who said he was bearish.	
 
 The special edition of the monthly poll was taken shortly
after the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11,
and showed a 10 point slide in investor sentiment from a similar
poll taken earlier in the month.	
 The Reuters sentiment index fell to minus 30 after the
disasters, compared with minus 20 earlier in March. February's
sentiment stood at minus 4. The poll is calculated by
subtracting the percentage of investors who say they are bearish
from those who are bullish.	
 
 SPIRIT OF JAPAN	
 Nearly 73 percent of the respondents to the special poll
said they believed the crisis could prove a turning point for
the long-stagnant country.	
 ""The Japanese still have reserve strength left. It will take
some time but I think this will become a big turning point, like
the postwar revival,"" said one investor.	
 Underpinning the hopes for a rebuilding, investors turned
bullish on shares of real estate and construction companies.	
 Investors were most pessimistic on shares of financials and
insurance companies.	
 Respondents were highly critical of the current
administration's handling of the crisis. Nearly 41 percent of
those surveyed said they disapproved of the response of Prime
Minister Naoto Kan's government, while nearly 28 percent
strongly disapproved.	
 ""They do not understand at all the people's feelings or
mindset, they are unable to communicate their message,"" said one
respondent about the administration.	
 Several said the government was slow to respond to the
nuclear crisis and has been unwilling to quickly share
information with the public.	
 A majority of those polled said the government should scale
back or completely eliminate plans for new nuclear plants. Japan
has said it plans to build 14 new power plants by 2030, of which
half are expected to be nuclear powered.	
 About 44 percent of those polled said the number of nuclear
plants should be reduced, while 13 percent said nuclear plants
should be left out of the plan altogether.	
 The special edition of the poll surveyed 933 individual
investors on March 16-18. During that time the Nikkei average
fell as low as 8,639.	
 The initial March poll surveyed 830 respondents between
March 7 and 10, when the Nikkei was hovering around 10,500.

 By Kaori Kaneko and Tetsushi Kajimoto	
 TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Japan warned markets on Tuesday
it would act again to keep the yen in check and prevent its
rapid gains from derailing Tokyo's effort to rebuild areas
ravaged by this month's deadly earthquake and tsunami and revive
the struggling economy.	
 In their first joint intervention since 2000, Group of Seven
rich nations sold the yen on Friday after it spiked to
record highs, threatening to deal another blow to the
export-reliant economy that was just picking up from a lull when
the disaster struck.	
 ""We will cooperate as appropriate while closely watching
market movements,"" Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told a news
conference after a cabinet meeting. 
 The yen traded around 81 to the dollar, well off last
week's record high of 76.25, and analysts said the 80-80.85
range could serve as a floor for the U.S. currency. Noda said he
would not comment on any specific levels when asked about
market's reaction to the intervention.	
 The yen's strength, driven by speculation that Japanese
firms will bring back a big chunk of their overseas investments
to fund Japan's biggest reconstruction push since the post-World
War Two period, is just one of Tokyo's concerns.	
 The authorities are also racing to avert a disastrous
meltdown at a quake-crippled nuclear plant while rushing
humanitarian relief to the country's northeast, where the March
11 quake and tsunami wiped out whole communities, leaving at
least 21,000 dead or missing and more than 350,000 homeless.	
 There are no official estimates yet, but Economics Minister
Kaoru Yosano told Reuters last week the total economic impact
could exceed 20 trillion yen ($247 billion).	
 The government may pass two or more extra budget with the
first batch possibly in April or May, even before official
damage estimates are ready, the ruling party's secretary-general
Katsuya Okada said.	
 ""At this stage, there's no way for us to have an estimate of
how much the cost of reconstruction would add up to. Therefore,
it will be focused on urgent measures,"" Okada told reporters.	
 He said, another more comprehensive emergency budget could
be drafted later once the scale of the devastation is clearer.	
 
 COALITION OFFER	
 The enormity of the task prompted Prime Minister Naoto Kan
to invite the leader of the main opposition party to join the
cabinet as his deputy in charge of disaster relief.	
 The offer was swiftly rejected, but on Tuesday Yosano
renewed the appeal, saying Japan should form a grand coalition
to better cope with the crisis.	
 ""I think it is best to form a grand coalition to speed up
political decisions,"" Yosano told reporters.	
 Before the quake, opposition parties, which control
parliament's upper house, had been trying to force an early
election by blocking several bills needed to implement the
2011/2012 budget, such as one authorising the government to
issue new bonds. 
 The government will still need opposition deputies' votes to
pass bills related to the regular budget as well as extra
budgets. However, since the disaster struck the opposition has
signalled it would not stand in the way of government's
emergency efforts. 
 It looks certain that the government will end up spending
much more than after the 1995 quake in Kobe when it passed extra
budgets worth more than 3 trillion yen. Some estimates put the
figure this time above 10 trillion, or nearly 3 percent of gross
domestic product. 
 While Kan said it was too early to talk about the size of
such budgets or their funding, Japanese media have been
speculating for days where the money might come from. In a
latest such report, the Nikkei newspaper said that one option
was to use 2.5 trillion yen earmarked as a subsidy to public
pension funds, although Yosano dismissed that idea.	
 Yosano also said that the government would continue to work
on tax and social security reform, which it started before the
disaster struck to contain runaway public debt, now already
twice the size of the $5 trillion economy.	
 Moody's Investors Service ratings agency said on Monday it
expected Japan to finance the reconstruction mainly via a
combination of shifts within the budget and new borrowing.	
 It also said that even though risks have increased for
Japan's economy, which it now expects to shrink this year, Tokyo
should have no difficulty financing the rebuilding effort.

 * Yen ticks up but below last week's record high
 * JGB futures down 0.28 point; focus on emergency spending

 By Hideyuki Sano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Japanese shares rose almost 4
percent on Tuesday while government bond futures slipped as
reports of progress to contain radiation leaks at a quake-hit
nuclear plant prompted investors to buy back risky assets.	
 As Tokyo markets reopened after a long weekend, the yen
edged higher, although it traded below its record high reached
on Friday, before the world's major central banks intervened for
the first time since 2000, using an estimated $30-35 billion.	
 Technicians working at the stricken nuclear plant on Japan's
Pacific coast have managed to attach power cables to all six
reactors and started a pump at one of them to cool overheating
nuclear fuel rods. 
 This encouraged investors to buy back domestic shares,
especially after they fell 10 percent last week.	
 ""The problem of nuclear leakage appears to be moving in the
right direction, which is... helping shares,"" said Ryosuke
Okazaki, chief investment officer at ITC Investment Partners
Corp. 
 ""But at the moment, there are too many uncertainties. We
still need to analyse the impact of the nuclear leakage problem
and the outlook for power shortage in the long run.""	
 The Nikkei was up 3.9 percent at 9,565.00 points,
popping above the key 9,500 level where portfolio managers and
traders were expected to sell to cut losses. 
 The next resistance for the index seems to be the
March 14 low of 9,578.	
 
 NIKKEI VALUATION	
 Buyers were attracted to cheap valuations after Japanese
shares suffered their worst two-day decline since October 1987
earlier last week.	
 According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, the Nikkei 225
components were trading right above book, with their
price-to-book ratio standing at 1.1. The same ratio for the S&P
500 index stood at 2.2.	
 ""Global value funds together with long-only investors are
piling right in the middle of the index today, chasing big,
liquid stocks attracted by cheap valuations,"" said Tetsuro Ii,
CEO of Commons Asset Management.	
 Toshiba was one of the biggest gainers. Its shares
rose more than 10 percent after the Nikkei business daily said
it planned to pay a fiscal year-end dividend of at least 2 yen
per share, its first in three years. 
 The Nikkei is still down more than 7 percent since January,
under performing the MSCI world equity index
which rose 1.7 percent. Financial, Utilities and energy sectors
were seen as cheapest, with their price to book ratios standing
at or below 1.	
 Nikkei futures in Chicago were up 3.2 percent at
9,540, while Osaka futures added 3.8 percent to 9,480.
The broader TOPIC index rose 4.2 percent to 858.50.	
 
 
 
 YEN BELOW RECORD HIGH	
 The yen was slightly stronger against the dollar and euro,
although investors wary of further intervention were reluctant
to push it higher closer to 80 per dollar.	
 The yen was up 0.1 percent at 80.96 per dollar . It
hit a record high of 76.25 last week before the intervention
took it to 82.00. The yen rose almost 0.2 percent to 115.09 per
euro .	
 Traders reported offers to sell dollars lined up from 82 yen
up to 83.50. 
 A customer dealer at a major Japanese bank in Tokyo said the
amount of dollar offers from customers at the 82 and 83 yen
levels have doubled compared with Thursday when the triggers
below 80 were hit as a result of awry derivatives bets.	
 Benchmark Japanese government 10-year bond futures
fell 0.28 point to 139.46.	
 Investors are concerned that the cost of Japan's triple
disaster of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency could be
as much as $200 billion, exceeding that of the 1995 Kobe
earthquake, a factor which would weigh on the JAB market.	
 A senior ruling party lawmaker was quoted as saying on
Monday that large supplementary budgets are needed by June to
help with reconstruction. 
 The Bank of Japan offered to inject 2 trillion yen of cash
in same-day operations to stabilise the money market, extending
its offer for six business days in a row and providing further
support to general risk appetite.	
 As a result, current account deposits at the BOA is expected
to rise to a fresh record high of 43.6 trillion yen, exceeding
levels seen in March 2004 when the central bank was adopting
quantitative easing.	
 The 10-year yield on the cash bond was up 4
basis points to 1.245 percent. 
 ""The 10-year yield is likely to stay around 1.2-1.3 percent
as things are calming down a bit. Many investors do not want to
trade actively ahead of their book-closing (at the end of
March),"" said Ruixue Xu, rate strategist at RBS.	
 ""There's talk about possible extra budget and shortfall in
tax revenue. But it's still not clear how many bonds they will
need to issue... My guess is that the market can absorb an extra
issue of about 10 trillion yen without major shocks.""

reports of progress to contain radiation leaks at the quake-hit
nuclear plant and the yen's decline prompted investors to buy
back risky assets.	
 The yen was broadly softer after leading central banks
intervened on Friday for the first time since 2000, using an
estimated $25 billion to stem export-damaging strength in the
Japanese currency.	
 Technicians working at the stricken nuclear plant on Japan's
Pacific coast have managed to attach power cables to all six

 This encouraged investors to buy back domestic stocks,

 ""Investors are buying blue-chip exporters, which were sold
off in panic on (last) Monday and Tuesday and now are gaining on
short-covering,"" said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at
Daiwa Securities Capital Markets.	
 ""This earthquake is difficult to compare with the one that
struck in Kobe in 1995, also in terms of impact on firms,
because it was followed by a tsunami, which makes assessment of
the damage sustained much harder,"" he said, pointing to a
further downside risk in the benchmark Nikkei average.	
 The Nikkei rose nearly 4 percent at one point on
Tuesday before trimming losses to stand up 3 percent at
9,487.52. It briefly rose above the key 9,500 level where
portfolio managers and traders were expected to sell to cut
losses. 
 Levels around 9,565 represent a 61.8 percent retracement of
last week's selloff. Beyond that, the March 14 low of 9,578
should prove the next resistance.	
 Most actively traded shares included Mitsubishi Paper
, Taiheiyo Cement and electronic giant NEC
.	
 ""The best-performing sectors since the earthquake have been
construction and mining. This reflects market expectations of
demand for reconstruction and fossil fuels,"" Barclays Capital
said in a note to clients.	
 Nikkei futures traded in Chicago were up 3.2 percent
at 9,540, while futures in Osaka also rose 3.4 percent
to 9,440.	
 The broader TOPIX index rose 3.5 percent to 858.93.	
 Early last week Japanese shares suffered their worst two-day
decline since October 1987.	
 The U.S.-listed shares of Japanese companies rose more than
2.1 percent on Monday.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2011 08:52PM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-Japan renews warning on yen, new offer to opposition"," (For more stories on the Japanese economy, click )	
 TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Japan issued a new warning on
Tuesday to those in markets who might try to drive the yen
higher, with Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda saying officials
were closely watching currency moves and would cooperate with G7
partners again as appropriate.	
 The Group of Seven rich nations intervened on Friday in a
rare coordinated action to stem the yen's climb after it
vaulted to a record high on speculation that a devastating March
11 earthquake and tsunami would force Japanese investors to
bring money back home to finance reconstruction.	
 ""We will cooperate as appropriate while closely watching
market movements,"" Noda told a news conference after a cabinet
meeting, adding that it was meaningful that the G7 acted in
concert.	
 Asked about market reaction to the intervention, Noda said
he would not comment on specific currency levels.	
 Warnings that the group was ready to strike again have kept
markets on edge so far this week, with the yen hovering
around 81.2 per dollar early on Tuesday when Japanese markets
reopened after a long weekend.	
 Speaking separately, Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano renewed
Prime Minister Naoto Kan's offer to the opposition to join the
cabinet, saying a broad coalition would speed up decision making
in response to the nation's worst crisis since World War Two.	
 Kan suggested last week that the government could be
broadened to bring in opposition representatives, but the main
opposition party so far has rejected the offer.	
 Yosano also dismissed a suggestion in a newspaper report
that the government might take some of the funds earmarked in
the budget for the public pension system and use them to finance
disaster relief efforts.	
 ""It is undesirable to use pension funds as a source of money
for disaster relief, as it would destroy the basic principle of
a pension fund,"" Yosano told reporters.	
 The government has yet to give its estimates of the damage,
but Yosano told Reuters last week the total impact could exceed
20 trillion yen ($250 billion), making the March 11 quake and
tsunami by far the world's costliest natural disaster.	
 It looks certain that Tokyo will need additional emergency
budgets worth several trillions of yen, but Kan said it was too
early to estimate the size of such budgets and the government
was not yet at a stage of discussing revenue sources.

 SINGAPORE, March 22 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks jumped more
than 4 percent on Tuesday amid reports of progress in
stabilising an earthquake-damaged nuclear plant and the yen
edged up, putting traders on heightened alert for more central
bank intervention.	
 Oil prices were steady, following a 1 percent rise in the
previous session as widening unrest in the Middle East fed fears
of supply disruptions.	
 Gold edged higher supported by a weak dollar and violence in
the Middle East that boosted its safe-haven appeal. 
 Asian shares outside of Japan posted modest gains to recoup
all of last week's losses, building on gains on Monday when
Tokyo markets were closed for a holiday.	
 A firm close for U.S. stocks after AT&T's move to buy
Deutsche Telecom offered Asia support. 
 ""Shares are bouncing with the Japan nuclear fear abating as
the latest news reports point to steady progress on repairs at
the nuclear plant site,"" said Kwak Joong-bo, a market analyst at
Samsung Securities in Seoul.	
 However, European shares were seen opening lower in payback
for three sessions of gains and S&P 500 futures were down
0.1 percent, pointing to a subdued Wall Street later.	
 
 Tokyo's Nikkei share average rose 4.4 percent to
close near its intraday high.

and Chicago-traded Nikkei futures gained 3.2 percent.

liquid stocks attracted by cheap valuations,"" said Tetsuro Ii,
CEO of Commons Asset Management. 
 The Nikkei is trading at a price-to-book ratio of 1.1, lower
than 2.2 for the U.S. benchmark S&P 500, Thomson Reuters
Starmine data shows.	
 The Nikkei is down 6.3 percent from its close on March 11,
the day northeastern Japan was struck by a 9.0 magnitude
earthquake and a 10-metre tsunami. The disaster has left at
least 21,000 people dead or missing and crippled a nuclear power
plant.	
 On Tuesday, technicians working inside an evacuation zone
around the stricken plant 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo had
managed to attach power cables to all six reactors and start a
pump at one of them to cool overheating nuclear fuel rods.	
 But rising smoke and haze from two of the most threatening
reactors suggested the battle to avert a disastrous meltdown was
far from won, and mounting evidence of radiation in vegetables,
water and milk stirred more concerns about the long-term impact.	
 MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
rose 0.6 percent, bolstered by a rise in the Dow
Jones industrial average and broader S&P 500 of
1.5 percent. 
 Asian shares outside Japan have now recovered all the ground
they lost after the earthquake.	
 
 DEFENCELESS DOLLAR	
 The yen traded up about 0.1 percent around 80.90 per
dollar and edged up against the euro to around
115.10. 
 Last week, expectations the cost of quake reconstruction
would prompt insurance firms and others in Japan -- a big net
creditor to the rest of the world -- to repatriate yen drove the
Japanese currency to a record 76.25 per dollar before the Group
of Seven rich nations stepped in on Friday.	
 Leading central banks spent more than $30 billion to drive
the yen back above 80 to the dollar, the first such coordinated
intervention since 2000. Traders said the Bank of Japan might
intervene again if the dollar falls closer to 80 yen.	
 The dollar on Tuesday skidded as investors embraced
leveraged risk trades in stocks and commodity-linked currencies
such as the Australian dollar .	
 Expectations the Federal Reserve will maintain its
super-loose monetary policy for some time to come have made it
safe to borrow dollars to fund investments in higher-yielding
currencies and assets -- the so-called carry trade -- traders
said.	
 European Central Bank policymakers, in contrast, have been
warning they are ready to raise interest rates despite
uncertainty about the strength of the economy, helping to push
the single currency to a four-month high.	
 The euro rose to highs not seen since November at $1.4240
and was later trading around $1.4225, while the dollar
index broke down through support at 75.631, the low hit
in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's second round of
quantitative easing.	
 ""Though much of the focus has been on JPY and the chances of
further coordinated intervention, the USD is barely able to
defend itself,"" said David Watt, a senior currency strategist at
RBC Capital Markets.	
 Benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond futures
fell 0.34 point to 139.40, while the 10-year yield
edged up 0.4 basis point to 1.245 percent. 
 ""I expect the 10-year JGB yield will move around 1.2
percent. I was selling JGBs last week but I started to buy a
little bit this week,"" said a fund manager at a U.S. asset
management firm.	
 ""The earthquake is going to have a big impact on the macro
economy. We are going to see soft economic data in coming
months. Reconstruction demand will not come until a few months
later and power shortage is likely to curtail growth.""	
 U.S. crude oil futures were little changed at $102.34
a barrel and Brent crude also barely budged to trade at
$114.93. Gold edged up to around $1,428.75 an ounce.	
 Anti-aircraft fire rang out across Tripoli for a third night
on Monday, but air attacks on Libya are likely to slow, a U.S.
general said, as Washington holds back from being sucked into
the Libyan civil war. 
 ""It now seems likely that there will be a significant loss
of Libyan oil supplies for some time,"" said Ric Spooner, chief
market analyst at CMC Markets.	
 ""This will reduce the buffer of excess capacity and increase
the oil market's vulnerability to any new supply shocks which
may emerge.""

 By Jon Herskovitz and Chisa Fujioka 
 RIKUZENTAKATA, Japan, March 22 (Reuters) - In a devastated
landscape of splintered homes, rotting bodies and twisted cars,
an elderly man walks with stooped shoulders searching for any
object that can bring back memories of his daughter.	
 ""Her home used to be there but that is gone,"" the man who
asked to be called by his family name Kikuchi said, pointing at
a spot in the town of Rikuzentakata, levelled by the tsunami of
nearly two weeks ago.	
 ""My daughter is missing. She is gone. I was up in the hills
above town and couldn't get to her in time,"" Kikuchi said in a
steady voice.	
 ""I am looking for something that can remind me of her. There
must be something here,"" Kikuchi said and then resumed wandering
through the mud-strewn debris in the town of broken buildings
erased by a giant wall of water.	
 The tsunami took just about everything from those in its
path who escaped with just the clothes on their backs, as the
wall of water destroyed homes, pictures, keepsakes and all the
objects that are touchstones of memories.	
 People who have spent decades in these northeastern coastal
towns now find themselves disoriented when they return because
streets have vanished and landmarks disappeared.	
 In Ofunato, a middle-aged couple looked shell-shocked as
they walked around for the first time since the quake to what
used to be their neighborhood -- now a flat stretch of
overturned trucks, splintered wood pieces from houses and
crushed roofs.	
 ""There is absolutely nothing left. I got in my car after the
tsunami warning, thinking I would come back. I didn't have my
wallet or my insurance card,"" the wife said.	
 She was clutching a wine opener she fond where her home used
to be. ""This was the only thing I could find in there.""	
 The March 11 earthquake and tsunami left at least 21,000
people dead or missing and thousands homeless.	
 
 EVACUATION CENTRES	
 Almost all of the survivors are at evacuation shelters near
their former homes sleeping in places such as cramped school
gymnasiums, not far from message boards covered with requests
seeking information on the missing and schedules for buses
running to the morgue for body identification.	
 During the day, some venture back to where they once lived
to survey the damage and perhaps salvage a few items. Many want
to see the towns rebuilt, also asking themselves if they want to
return.	
 Firefighters dispatched from Sakura, near Tokyo, pasted
messages on their helmets with yellow and red reflective tape
reading ""Fight Iwate"" and sifted through debris searching for
bodies and collecting photos from the wreckage they hope to
return to victims.	
 ""All that I have left of my home is a hole with debris from
somebody else's home,"" said Yasuo Koshita in the flattened town
of Otsuchi.	
 He escaped by fleeing to a nearby hill and watched the
tsunami roll through the town, churning up cars and homes in a
black soup of destruction that deposited items haphazardly when
the water finally retreated.	
 ""This rail line came from that embankment across the way.
The roof from the pump station ended up over there about 500
metres away and I have no idea what happened to these three big
trees down the road that were more than 100 years old.""	
 Koshita said he had a false sense of security living near a
wall to protect the town from a tsunami but it was of no use
when the wave hit.	
 ""We are nestled in the mountains with the sea nearby and a
river that flowed through town. The fishing was wonderful and it
was peaceful,"" he said.	
 ""This used to be such a beautiful place.""

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Monday
as risk appetite returned after Japan had some success
controlling a crippled nuclear plant, while the yen slipped on
speculation of further market intervention.
 Japan's markets were closed for a holiday, but the MSCI
index of Asian stocks outside of Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose
1.35 percent and U.S.-traded Nikkei futures gained more than 3
percent for a third straight session.
 The yen fell on investor concerns over more coordinated
actions by the world's major central banks to weaken the
Japanese currency following last week's intervention by the
Group of Seven.
 Oil prices were higher as unrest in the Middle East
intensified concerns about potential threats to the region's
oil supply and U.N.-mandated air strikes kept OPEC-member
Libya's output reduced. For details see [ID:nL3E7EK0J3].
 But in a sign U.S. stock markets were returning to normal
after Japan's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, Wall
Street's so-called fear gauge posted its largest daily
percentage drop since May.
 U.S. stocks closed 1.5 percent higher as investors welcomed
AT&T Inc's  $39 billion offer to buy T-Mobile USA from
Deutsche Telekom  in what would be the world's
biggest deal this year and Germany's biggest in a decade.
 ""The market has been really volatile and it will continue
to be really volatile. The AT&T deal is just a piece of it, the
other is a sense there is some better news out of Japan and
things haven't gotten any worse in Africa,"" said Gail Dudack,
chief investment strategist at Dudack Research Group in New

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 178.01

Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> gained 48.42 points, or 1.83 percent,
to 2,692.09.
 The third day of gains in U.S. stocks followed two weeks of
losses over concerns about unrest in oil-producing North Africa
and the Middle East.
 ""The effects on oil from Libya to the US are very modest,
if (any) at all,"" Dudack said. ""The Saudis are making up the
difference (in output) so it comes down more to politics than

earthquake-damaged reactors is a major step in managing its
nuclear crisis, but two smoking reactors and worries about food

 (Adds details, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - The yen fell against the
U.S. dollar for a second day on Monday, with investors wary of
more central bank selling to weaken the Japanese currency,
though markets could test the authorities' resolve by pushing
the currency back toward the 80 yen level.
 Traders said Friday's coordinated invention by the world's
major central banks -- the first such move since 2000 -- had
been successful for now, as the dollar stabilized around 81 yen
and yen volatility retreated from recent highs.
 In the near term, analysts said the 80 to 80.85 area could
serve as a floor for the dollar against the yen, and a fall
below could see renewed intervention by central banks. On the
upside, resistance is seen around 82 yen, the post-intervention
high set on Friday.
 ""The market is certainly very wary about central banks
being on the sidelines,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency
strategist at OANDA in Toronto.
 ""The market is also questioning who would be intervening if
the yen does start to appreciate, whether it will be the Bank
of Japan on its own or it will be another coordinated
intervention. But at the moment, nobody is willing to test the
waters,"" he added.
 The dollar last traded up 0.6 percent at 81.049 yen
 on electronic trading platform EBS, moving further
away from a record low of 76.25 yen set on EBS last week.
 Traders said the pair was boosted by demand from
model-generated trading accounts, while offers were seen at
81.30/50 and 82.00. Strong resistance lies around 84 yen, a
level that will attract offers from Japanese exporters.
 Jon Wetreich, currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York, said the dollar/yen will trade in a range
of 80.50 to 82.
 ""Markets tend to test intervention levels and central bank
commitment, and thus we expect a test of at least the 80.50
level this week,"" he said.
 Morgan Stanley in a note said their flows data indicated
very strong demand for yen last week, with clients buying yen
in large amounts with record high trading volumes in yen
crosses.
 Traders and analysts say the Bank of Japan, the European
Central Bank and Bank of Canada together conducted around $32.3
billion worth of yen-selling intervention Friday. Nomura
estimates the Federal Reserve spent about $1 billion. Estimates
for the Bank of England were not immediately available. 
 Barclays Capital in a note said that ""Japan can sell as
much as it desires, as there is potentially no limitation on
selling its own currency."" For the other G7 countries, the firm
said they have more than $53 billion in yen reserves, which
""appears sufficient for a while at face value.""

 RETURN OF CARRY TRADES?
 Stocks rallied in part on a glimmer of hope about Japan's
nuclear crisis following a massive earthquake 10 days ago,
further encouraging investors to wade back into riskier assets,
which often involves selling yen to finance purchases. 
 Intervention has succeeded in bringing down implied
volatility on dollar/yen, with one-month  trading at
around 12 percent, well off about 21 percent on Thursday. 
 The yen also fell against other major currencies. The euro
was last up 0.6 percent  while the Australian dollar
rose 1.3 percent  and the Canadian dollar advanced
0.9 percent versus the yen .
 Analysts said positive risk appetite, expectations that
Japanese money market rates will remain low and the Bank of
Japan putting a cap on the yen's rise meant conditions
supported at least some yen-funded carry trades.
 ""Carry trades can be put back on, but in places where
yields are more likely to rise and where there's more value,
such as Canada, Scandinavia or even the euro,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, currency analyst at Lloyds Banking Group.
 The euro was last up 0.2 percent at $1.4220  after
rising to $1.42405 on EBS, a 4-1/2-month high. Expectations the
European Central Bank will lift interest rates at its next
meeting in April have supported the euro.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell to 75.340
<.DXY>, its lowest level since December 2009.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2011 04:04PM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Euro zone ""Unfinished Symphony"" is no masterpiece"," By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, March 21 (Reuters) - Unlike Schubert's Unfinished
Symphony, Europe's incomplete ""comprehensive response"" to the
euro zone debt crisis is unlikely to be rated a masterpiece.
 When European Union leaders complete a package deal this
week to tighten fiscal discipline, improve economic policy
coordination and strengthen their financial backstops, they will
leave much unfinished business.
 Finance ministers of the 17-nation currency area are likely
to be back in crisis management mode within weeks to bail out
Portugal, despite Lisbon's feverish efforts to avert a
humiliating international rescue.
 ""The relative calm now prevailing in euro zone financial
markets should not deceive us,"" said Marco Annunziata, chief
economist at GE.
 ""Investors have given them the benefit of the doubt, but if
EU leaders fail to deliver, tensions will surge anew,
jeopardizing the recovery,"" he wrote in a syndicated column for
the Eurointelligence economic website.
 After a March 11 summit deal to increase the lending
capacity of the euro zone rescue fund and allow it to buy
sovereign bonds of distressed countries in the primary market
under strict conditions, the consensus among bank economists was
that leaders had done enough to stabilise the euro.
 But Portugal is only one of a string of problems that they
left unresolved and which may return to haunt them if financial
markets turn sour.
 Those issues include the long-term solvency of Greece and
Ireland, the solvency and stress resistance of Europe's banking
system, the implementation of tough austerity programmes and a
widening growth gap between core Europe and the periphery.
 
 ""SAFE WATERS""?
 There are also tricky detailed questions of who pays what
and how to fund the euro zone's temporary and permanent rescue
mechanisms, which could get snagged in domestic politics in
Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.
 Ireland's new government, elected on a wave of public anger
over last year's EU/IMF bailout, will have to make some
concessions to Germany and France on harmonising the corporate
tax base in the euro zone if it wants a cut in the interest rate
on its emergency loans.
 Greece, which has stuck to a draconian austerity programme
adopted last May, won a reduced interest rate and an extension
in the maturities of its euro zone loans by promising to
implement a 50 billion euro ($70.6 billion) privatisation
programme.
 With a lot of self-help from Madrid, EU leaders may have
succeeded in erecting a firewall to prevent bond market
contagion from spreading beyond Portugal to the far bigger
economies of Spain and Italy.
 ""We are not yet fully in safe waters, but we have made
headway,"" says an EU official at the heart of the fire fighting.
 If the euro zone can quarantine just three smaller economies
in intensive care, it will have bought time to repair its ailing
banks and equip them to withstand a possible restructuring of
Greek or Irish debt after 2013.
 That is the task of Europe-wide stress tests launched last
week. But EU countries are still haggling over the yardstick to
apply for capital adequacy, and Germany, suspected of having
some of the biggest problems in its regional Landesbanken, is
resisting pressure to set aside funds now to recapitalise them.
 While the European Central Bank has repeatedly warned that
any sovereign default would have catastrophic consequences on
the European financial system, EU leaders have stopped short of
making a clear commitment to prevent one.
 Indeed some German officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, share the view of most market analysts that Greece's
debt burden is unsustainable in the long run and will have to be
restructured -- just not now when German lenders are so weak.
 This raises at least two major uncertainties -- a political
and a financial one.
 The political question is how long voters in Greece and
Ireland will go on enduring grinding austerity and recession if
they come to believe their suffering is being prolonged to spare
German, French or British banks from taking losses.
 At the same time, there is growing public fury in the euro
zone's wealthy northern countries at being asked to put ever
more money on the table to back the currency zone's weaklings.
 The financial question is who will buy Greek or Irish bonds
from 2013, when they are due to return to the market and those
bonds carry an EU-imposed collective action clause making
investors liable to share losses in any future default.
 EU leaders have kicked those issues down the road by
agreeing to a minimalist fix now. Chancellor Angela Merkel and
President Nicolas Sarkozy may be calculating that they can avoid
more unpalatable solutions until after their next elections.
 But their ""Unfinished Symphony"" ensures that euro zone debt
crisis will continue to fester for years to come.

 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Stocks in major world
markets rallied on Monday as the appetite for riskier assets
returned following some progress in resolving Japan's nuclear
plant crisis, while the yen slipped on speculation of further
market intervention.
 Japan's markets were closed for a holiday, but the MSCI
index of Asian stocks outside of Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 1.4

 Oil prices were higher after a second round of

earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis have increased in the
past week, Moody's said on Monday, but it expects the Japanese
economy to resume growth in the second half of the year.
 Moody's currently expects the Japanese economy to
experience a brief recession in the second quarter of 2011 and
to emerge from it right after. As a result, gross domestic
product would still grow 1 percent this year, down from the 1.4
percent forecast before the disaster, the agency said.
 In 2012, however, Moody's sees reconstruction supporting
economic expansion of 2.3 percent, up from its previous
forecast of 1.9 percent.
 ""The key assumption underlining this base case is a speedy
containment of the nuclear problem,"" Moody's said in a

 (Adds further comment, detail, background)
 LONDON/HAMBURG, March 21 (Reuters) - Grain cargoes are
reaching Japanese ports after disruptions at terminals last week
due to an earthquake and tsunami that held up shipments,
shipping and trade sources said on Monday.
Sources said vessels were using other ports that had not
been affected to discharge cargoes.
 ""The grain shipments seem to be being transferred to
southern Japanese ports without difficulties,"" a European grain
trader said.
 Some compound feed manufacturers in northern Japan are
believed to have suffered damage and may be cancelling or
reselling feed grain import shipments, another trader said.
 ""But I do not expect significant delays to grain shipments
already underway, which are still wanted,"" the second trader
said.
 Sources said last week at least nine vessels carrying grain
were at anchorage in Japanese waters or were slowing down their
expected arrival time as they could not offload their cargoes
which included grains from the United States and soybeans from
South America.
 Corn and wheat futures prices have been volatile since the
March 11 disaster due to prospects of a temporary reduction in
purchases by Japan, the world's biggest importer of corn,
third-largest of soybeans, and fourth-biggest wheat buyer.
 Jeffrey Landsberg, managing director of dry bulk consultancy
Commodore Research, said grains shipments were reaching Japan.
 ""Grain cargoes, in particular, are being diverted to
southern Japanese ports -- but some thermal coal cargoes are
being diverted to regional Asian buyers,"" he said.
 ""Ensuring an adequate supply of food and water ... is more
of a priority to the government now than ending the rolling
(power) blackouts.""

 * Volatility in yen falls after last week's intervention
 * Euro rises above $1.42, highest since November
 (Adds details, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - The yen fell against the
dollar for a second straight day on Monday, with investors wary
of more central bank selling to weaken the Japanese currency,
though markets could test authorities' resolve by pushing the
pair back toward the 80 level.
 Traders said Friday's coordinated invention by the world's
major central banks -- the first such move since 2000 -- had
been successful for now, as the dollar stabilized around 81 yen
and yen volatility retreated from recent highs.
 In the near term, analysts said the 80 to 80.85 area could
serve as a floor for the dollar against the yen, and a fall
below could see renewed intervention by central banks. On the
upside, resistance is seen around 82 yen, the post-intervention
high set on Friday.
 ""The market is certainly very wary about central banks
being on the sidelines,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency
strategist at OANDA in Toronto.
 ""The market is also questioning who would be intervening if
the yen does start to appreciate, whether it will be the Bank
of Japan on its own or it will be another coordinated
intervention. But at the moment, nobody is willing to test the
waters,"" he added.
 The dollar last traded up 0.5 percent at 80.96 yen on
electronic trading platform EBS, moving further away from a
record low of 76.25 yen set on EBS last week.
 Traders said the pair was boosted by demand from
model-generated trading accounts, while offers were seen at
81.30/50 and 82.00. Strong resistance lies around 84 yen, a
level that will attract offers from Japanese exporters.
 Jon Wetreich, currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York, said the dollar/yen will trade in a range
of 80.50 to 82.
 ""Markets tend to test intervention levels and central bank
commitment, and thus we expect a test of at least the 80.50
level this week,"" he said.
 Morgan Stanley in a note said their flows data indicated
very strong demand for yen last week, with clients buying yen
in large amounts with record high trading volumes in yen
crosses.
 Traders and analysts say the Bank of Japan, the European
Central Bank and Bank of Canada together conducted around $32.3
billion worth of yen-selling intervention Friday. Nomura
estimates the Federal Reserve spent about $1 billion. Estimates
for the Bank of England were not immediately available.
 Barclays Capital in a note said that ""Japan can sell as
much as it desires, as there is potentially no limitation on
selling its own currency."" For the other G7 countries, the firm
said they have more than $53 billion in yen reserves, which
""appears sufficient for a while at face value.""
 RETURN OF CARRY TRADES?
 Stocks rallied in part on a glimmer of hope about Japan's
nuclear crisis following a massive earthquake 10 days ago,
further encouraging investors to wade back into riskier assets,
which often involves selling yen to finance purchases.
Intervention has succeeded in bringing down implied
volatility on dollar/yen, with one-month trading at around 12
percent, well off about 21 percent on Thursday.
 The yen also fell against other major currencies. The euro
was last up 0.4 percent while the Australian dollar rose 1.1
percent and the Canadian dollar advanced 0.8 percent versus the
yen.
 Analysts said positive risk appetite, expectations that
Japanese money market rates will remain low and the Bank of
Japan putting a cap on the yen's rise meant conditions
supported at least some yen-funded carry trades.
 ""Carry trades can be put back on, but in places where
yields are more likely to rise and where there's more value,
such as Canada, Scandinavia or even the euro,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, currency analyst at Lloyds Banking Group.
 The euro was last up 0.2 percent at $1.42110 after rising
to $1.42177 on EBS, a 4-1/2-month high. Expectations the
European Central Bank will lift interest rates at its next
meeting in April have supported the euro.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell to 75.428,
its lowest level since December 2009.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Stocks in major world
markets rallied on Monday as the appetite for riskier assets
returned following some progress in resolving Japan's nuclear
plant crisis, while the yen slipped on speculation of further
market intervention.
 Japan's markets were closed for a holiday, but the MSCI
index of Asian stocks outside of Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 1.4
percent.
 The yen fell on investor concerns over more coordinated
actions by the world's major central banks to weaken the
Japanese currency following last week's intervention by the
Group of Seven.
 Oil prices were slightly higher after a second round of
U.N.-mandated airstrikes on Libya and after spreading protests
in the Middle East reinforced concerns about potential supply
disruption.
 In a sign of some normalcy returning to the markets
following the Japanese earthquake, tsunami and nuclear plant
crisis, Wall Street's fear gauge posted its largest daily drop
since May.
 U.S. stocks were up about 1.5 percent on Monday afternoon
in New York as investors welcomed AT&T Inc's  $39 billion
offer to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom in what would
be the world's biggest deal this year and Germany's biggest in
a decade.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 186.78
points, or 1.58 percent, at 12,045.30. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 19.54 points, or 1.53 percent, at
1,298.74.
 ""Any sort of M&A activity has a beneficial impact on the
market as a whole because it gives the impression corporate
insiders see value in the market,"" said Thomas Villalta,
portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Asset Management in
Austin, Texas, which he said has a small holding in telecom
services.
 The gains in U.S. stocks for a third day followed two weeks
of losses over concerns about unrest in oil-producing North
Africa and the Middle East. Japan's earthquake and tsunami and
the ensuing nuclear crisis deepened investors' concerns about a
continued global economic recovery.
 ""More incrementally positive news from Japan in terms of
the nuclear situation is helping the market,"" said John
Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
 The CBOE volatility index <.VIX> tumbled 15.8 percent in
its largest daily percentage drop since last May.
 It fell below its 14- and 200-day moving averages for the
first time since the earthquake in Japan.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
rose 1.7 percent to hit a one-week high and the MSCI world
share index <.MIWD00000PUS> jumped 1.5 percent, the largest
daily gain in seven weeks.
 Experts said Japan's reconnection of power to its
earthquake-damaged reactors is a major step in managing its
nuclear crisis but two smoking reactors and worries about food
safety showed the crisis was far from over. For details, see

 YEN SLIPS, EURO HITS 4-MONTH HIGH
 The yen added to losses, with speculators wary of more
coordinated actions by top central banks after joint G7
intervention last week hoisted the greenback nearly 4.0 percent
versus the Japanese currency. The U.S. dollar rose 0.2 percent
for the day to 80.97 yen .
 The euro  rose above $1.42 against the U.S. dollar
for the first time since November as markets braced for a euro
zone interest rate hike as soon as next month.

 * It still needs more rain in April
 * Algeria wants to reduce its imports
 
 By Lamine Chikhi
 ALGIERS, March 21 (Reuters) - Algeria's grain-growing
regions have had enough rainfall so far, but the level in April
will determine whether this year's harvest will be good, an
official from the agriculture ministry said.
 ""So far the situation is good, but not very good,"" Mohamed
Habila, director of the Agriculture Ministry's National
Institute for Soils, Irrigation and Drainage, told Reuters on
Monday.
 ""We still need rainfall in April to make sure we will get a
good harvest. It is still too early to make forecasts,"" Habila
said in a phone interview.
 ""We are expecting more rain in the coming days and weeks,
and this is good news.""
 Algeria ranks roughly as the world's fifth-biggest importer
of wheat, with an average of 5 million tonnes per year. Any
shortfall in domestic production forces the country to rely more
heavily on world grain markets, in which prices have recently
reached multi-year highs.
 Agronomists say the Algerian grain crop requires rain during
two periods: the sowing season, when moisture is needed to
create the right soil conditions for the seed to develop, and in
March-April to ensure the plants mature properly.
 Last season's grain harvest was 4.56 million tonnes, below a
record 6.1 million tonnes in 2009 but comfortably above the
average for the past decade.
 ""We have launched an alert bulletin in March regarding four
regions including two regions specialized in grain, which are
Tiaret and Borbj Bou Arreridj. These regions need water
urgently,"" Habila said.
 The ministry of agriculture launched a plan in 2009 to
reduce Algeria's dependency on imports and boost its domestic
production.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2011 12:17PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-The economy -- not Libya or Japan -- drives investors," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - Any expectation that the
bombing of Libya by U.S., British and French forces would prompt
a rush into safer assets has been easily trumped by investors
focused on the underlying strength of the world economy.
 With the exception of gains in the price of oil and a bit of
gold action, markets on Monday paid scant attention to the
military intervention, instead buying riskier assets such as
stocks.
 Put bluntly, investors are primarily driven by the long-term
growth prospects for the global economy and while there are many
risks to this at the moment, they are still on the margins.
Libya -- with disruption to its 2 percent of world oil
output already priced in -- does not matter from that
perspective as things stand.
 ""The events in Libya ... do not jeopardise the global
economic outlook,"" Berenberg private bank told its clients.
 Japan, comprising 6 percent of the world economy, is a
different matter, of course. But even here, the underlying issue
for investors is the impact of Japan's triple disasters on
global growth.
 Hence, their spirits were lifted on Monday by indications
that the nuclear meltdown threat was easing and by estimates
from the World Bank that a temporary Japanese slow down would
have only a modest short-term impact on the nearby region.
 ""There will be a major hit to wealth, but hasn't that been
priced in already?"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global
strategy at Standard Life Investments.
 The Nikkei average fell close to 20 percent in the days
following the earthquake, before recovering somewhat, prompting
some investors to say there had been too great a reaction.
 ""Frequently, something out of the blue like this, an
extraordinary event, really creates a buying opportunity. I have
seen that happen in the United States, I have seen that happen
around the world,"" billionaire investor Warren Buffett said.
 ""I don't think Japan will be an exception.""
 
 RISKS
 None of this is to say that Libya and Japan do not present
risks to investors.
 Japan's nuclear crisis, for example, is not over and could
yet become more serious for the country's people and economy.
There are also major unanswered questions about the extent to
which the disaster will stop Japanese overseas investment.
 The country is a major driver of mergers and acquisitions,
for example, as well as foreign direct investment.
 In Libya, a prolonged military campaign could build concern.
More directly, it remains part of a broader pattern of revolt
across the Arab world that has pushed the price of oil into
territory where some economists worry about its impact on
growth- and profit-dampening inflation.
 Brent crude was above $115 a barrel on Monday as the
intervention in Libya heated up. But this was well short of its
recent peak just shy of $120.
 It was also a recovery from losses experienced after the
Japanese earthquake and tsunami when traders sold on the initial
expectations -- now somewhat reassessed -- that the disasters
could seriously hurt global growth.
 The recovery, though, would be categorised as a ""healthy""
demand-driven price rise as opposed to a more negative
supply-driven one.
 The biggest concern for investors is if the turmoil spreads
seriously to the core oil producers, notably Saudi Arabia, or if
the crackdown on mainly Shi'ite protesters in Bahrain prompts
more tangible outrage from Iran.
 
 MOVING ALONG NICELY
 Even then, it would be the impact on the global economy from
higher oil prices due to short- or long-term supply disruptions
that would cause investors to rush to safer assets.
 And a lot would depend how quickly it spiked, how long it
held there and what the impact on consumer confidence was.
""Simulations at $200 a barrel send Western economies into
recession and at $150 barrel growth is somewhat weaker but
recession can be avoided,"" said Sarah Hewin, senior economist at
Standard Chartered Bank.
 This is a long way off. So for now, the reason that
investors seem calm about Libya and less anxious about Japan is
that the global economy is doing well.
 The International Monetary Fund projects that global growth
will be in the region of 4.4 percent this year, well above
average for the past 20 years.
 Even a worst case scenario for Japan and a big spike in oil
would not cut this too much. And JPMorgan economists estimate
that growth may be even higher than the IMF suggests.
 Global manufacturing surveys, they calculate, imply growth
of more than 5 percent.

BRATISLAVA, March 21 (Reuters) - Slovakia could introduce a

agree a joint solution how to tax the financial sector, the
finance ministry said on Monday.
The European Commission is pushing for a one-off 50 billion
euro tax on banks, to levy assets, liabilities or profits and

 Miklos did not comment on the size of the tax or how much

 Slovaks, who adopted the euro in January 2009, have been
shielded from the direct impact of the global financial crisis,
partly due to very small holdings of toxic assets and low levels
of foreign currency borrowings.
 The central European country has not had to bail out any of

Hungarian parent banks
 Miklos, in charge to slash Slovakia's overall fiscal deficit
to below the EU's official limit of 3 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) by 2013 from 7.8 percent in 2010, said
the 2012 budget already counted on income from such a levy.

 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Stocks rose across the globe
on Monday as risk appetite returned following progress in
resolving Japan's nuclear crisis while the yen slid on
speculation of more central bank intervention.
 Oil prices rose but were off the session's highs after
Western forces launched a second wave of air strikes on Libya.
 U.S. stocks rose more than 1.5 percent as investors
welcomed AT&T's  proposal to buy T-Mobile USA from
Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion, which would be the world's
biggest deal this year and Germany's biggest in a decade.
 Deutsche Telekom AG  shares soared more than 13
percent.
 ""The fact that companies are confident to do big deals gets
people thinking that the environment may not be too bad, that
there is liquidity out there in the market. It opens doors for
other, larger M&A deals,"" said John Canally, investment
strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
 The gains in U.S. stocks follow a second straight week of
losses over concern about unrest in oil-producing northern
Africa and the Middle East. Japan's earthquake and tsunami and
the ensuing nuclear crisis deepened investors' concerns about
the global economy's ability to continue its recovery.
 ""More incrementally positive news from Japan in terms of
the nuclear situation is helping the market,"" Canally said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - The yen fell against the
dollar for a second straight session on Monday, with investors
wary of more central bank selling to weaken the Japanese
currency, though markets could test authorities' resolve by
pushing the pair back toward the 80 level.
 Traders said Friday's coordinated invention by the world's
major central banks -- the first such move since 2000 -- had
been successful at least for now, as the dollar stabilized
around 81 yen and the pair's volatility retreated from recent
highs.
 ""There's a lot of respect for G7 because it's a concerted
intervention,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency
research at GFT in New York. ""I think 80 is the floor. If we
start to dip below 80, we could see them come back and
intervene.""
 Stocks rose in part on a glimmer of hope about Japan's
nuclear crisis, further encouraging investors to wade back into
riskier assets, which often involves selling yen to finance the
purchase.
 The dollar last traded up 0.8 percent at 81.21 yen, moving
further away from a record low of 76.25 yen set on trading
platform EBS last week.
 Traders said the pair was boosted by demand from
model-generated trading accounts, while offers were seen at
81.30/50 and 82.00.
 Jon Wetreich, currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York, said central bank intervention Friday has
helped dollar/yen stabilize above 80.50.
 ""We expect that range to set today's range as well. Markets
tend to test intervention levels and central bank commitment,
and thus we expect a test of at least the 80.50 level this
week,"" he said.
 Traders and analysts say the Bank of Japan, the European
Central Bank and Bank of Canada together conducted around $32.3
billion worth of yen-selling intervention Friday. Estimates for
the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve were not
immediately available.
 Official yen-selling briefly pushed the dollar up nearly 4
percent to as high as 82.00 yen Friday.
 Intervention has succeeded in bringing down implied
volatility on dollar/yen, with one-month trading back down at
around 12.4 percent, well off the highs of about 21 percent
Thursday.
 The yen also fell against other major currencies. The euro
was last up 0.7 percent at 115.06 yen and the Australian dollar
rose 1.5 percent at 81.58 yen. The Canadian dollar advanced 3.8
percent versus the yen.
 Analysts said positive risk appetite, expectations that
Japanese money market rates will remain low and the Bank of
Japan putting a cap on the yen's rise meant conditions
supported at least some yen-funded carry trades.
 ""Carry trades can be put back on, but in places where
yields are more likely to rise and where there's more value,
such as Canada, Scandinavia or even the euro,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, currency analyst at Lloyds Banking Group.
 The euro rose above $1.42 for the first time since November
as risk appetite recovered and markets braced for a euro zone
interest rate hike as soon as next month.
 The euro was last slightly down at $1.4162 after earlier
rising to a session peak of $1.4204 on EBS, a 4-1/2-month
high.
 Expectations the European Central Bank will lift interest
rates at its next meeting in April have supported the euro.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell to 75.465,
its lowest level since December 2009, hampered by the Federal
Reserve's monetary easing policy.

 (Removes stray word from first paragraph, adds parlt vote)
 By Gergely Szakacs and Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, March 21 (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament elected
two new central bank policymakers on Monday who said they would
fight inflation, in a move which may ease market concerns that
the government would seek hasty rate cuts.
 Ruling Fidesz has nominated four new interest rate-setters
this month, which could put central bank governor Andras Simor
-- whom the government has criticised repeatedly over the last
year -- and his two deputies in a minority on the seven-member
rate-setting council.
 But most analysts said there was unlikely to be a marked
policy shift on the council, which would continue to act
cautiously and leave rates on hold for a while, while watching
the forint's exchange rate. 
 The bank had raised rates  by 75 basis points to 6
percent from November to January before pausing last month.
 Nevertheless, some analysts said rate cuts could come later
in the year, which would support the government's pro-growth
policies focusing on income tax cuts and job creation.
 Markets will closely monitor the new central bankers'
comments and voting patterns in coming months to gauge whether
the centre-right government is seeking to influence monetary
policy after giving itself the right to nominate all four new
rate setters, instead of having two picked by the bank itself.
 Anders Svendsen at Nordea said the new rate setters should
be given the benefit of the doubt and not labelled doves before
their first policy meeting, though some scepticism was
understandable.
 ""There is not much point in the government taking a lot of
heat to be able to appoint two more MPC members and then appoint
members that are not to some extent doves,"" Svendsen said.
 ""Therefore, we have unchanged interest rates in our forecast
for the coming quarters, but would not be surprised to see an
interest rate cut or two.""
 Fidesz' new nominations, which include two rate setters
elected earlier this month, will restore the seven-strong
council to its full size by the April rate meeting.
 Gyorgy Kocziszky, one of the two new rate setters, will only
be appointed after the next meeting of the bank on March 28.
""I'm absolutely committed regarding inflation, and I will
represent that view in the Monetary Council,"" economist Janos
Cinkotai, the other nominee, told a parliament committee.
 But he said strong caution was warranted as the central bank
should not take drastic steps in reaction to one-off events that
impact inflation and to external shocks.
 Kocziszky stressed the importance of predictability and said
he would focus on growth and sustainability as well.
 Local bond markets and the forint showed little reaction to
their comments.
 
 ECB CRITICISM
 Parliament elected the two new members with votes from
Fidesz and the far-right Jobbik party.
 The nominations were made based on government-sponsored
legal changes enacted earlier this year that were criticised by
the European Central Bank (ECB) as they stripped Simor of the
right to nominate two of the four policy makers.
 ""Given the tense government-central bank relationship there
were some concerns that the monetary council will be filled up
with members delivering a political mission of cutting interest
rates. This is not the case,"" said Zoltan Torok at Raiffeisen.
 But Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura in London said rate cuts
could be in the pipeline later in the year.
 ""Cinkotai seems clearly to be of the camp that doesn't
believe headline external shocks lead to core (inflation)
pressures,"" he said. 
 ""Cinkotai can think rates are too high for a one-off
external shock in his mind, whilst Kocziszky can be looking at
(economic) growth been too sluggish.""
 ""We retain our view that these members have been put in
place to engineer a rate cut later in year -- even if individual
members are independent of the government,"" he added.

 * Crude shipments grew
 * Metal shipments fell, with copper at 27-month low
 
 By Tom Miles
 BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - China's imports of many major
commodities all but dried up in February as a national holiday,
abundant stockpiles and rising prices combined to discourage
shipments, data from China's Customs office showed on Monday.
 Chinese demand is the motor of many world commodity markets,
but this year prices have been driven more by supply disruptions
around the world, while China's tighter monetary policy and a
crackdown on speculators has reined in bullish buying.
 Two of the commodity imports that slowed fastest in February
were iron ore and coking coal, the raw materials used by China's
vast army of steelmakers.
 February's imports of iron ore came in at 48.8 million
tonnes, falling back sharply from the previous month, when a
rush to fill orders before the week-long Lunar New Year helped
push volumes to a monthly record of 69 million tonnes.
 A 7 million tonne bulge in iron ore stocks at China's ports
so far this year, coupled with a cautious turn in steel prices
set by leading Chinese mills, point to weakening demand for
steel in the world's top steel market.
 Coking coal imports collapsed by almost two-thirds in
February, falling below 2 million tonnes for the first month
since May 2009 as the impact of Australia's disastrous floods
choked supplies and pushed up global prices.
 Overall shipments of coal to China, including supplies for
power production as well as steelmaking, fell to 6.8 million
tonnes, with each of the top three suppliers -- Indonesia,
Australia and Vietnam -- seeing trading volumes down by half
from February 2010.
 China's mild winter helped subdue demand for coal and other
forms of energy in the first two months of the year, although a
drought in wheat-growing areas prompted an emergency irrigation
campaign that added to demand for diesel, used to generate
pumps.
 China's drought helped open the door to 115,864 tonnes of
Australian wheat, likely degraded by flood damage and useful in
China's tight market for animal feed.
 
 CRUDE UP, METALS DOWN
 Although the extra diesel demand helped increase China's
overall apparent consumption of oil by 10.2 percent from
February 2010, the rise in demand owed something to stockpiling
of diesel, with a 28 percent leap in reserves of the fuel as the
government capped exports.
 Imports of liquefied natural gas fell to the lowest in nine
months. But a surge in pipeline gas from Turkmenistan, which
came on stream a year ago, provided the same amount -- 660,000
tonnes -- boosting access to the clean-burning fossil fuel,
which is expanding its share of the Chinese market from a small
base.
 Bucking the overall trend of slowing imports, crude oil
shipments grew to the third-highest level ever in February, with
Iran, Sudan and Venezuela all seeing big year-on-year increases
in the volume shipped to China.
 Russian crude oil volumes, at 1.6 million tonnes, almost
doubled from January as the new ESPO pipeline began to hit its
stride. But Russian oil supplies in the first two months of the
year were still down by 18 percent from a year previously after
oil supplies switched to the pipeline, deserting the more
expensive railway route used in the past.
 Chinese buying of base metals also hit the buffers in
February, with imports of refined copper tumbling 36 percent to
a 27-month low as the trade finally succumbed to economics.
 The window for profitable shipments to China has been shut
for months, but the momentum of annual supply contracts had
helped keep the metal flowing into China nevertheless.
 Traders estimate bonded stocks of copper, which have arrived
but not yet paid value-added tax, have doubled to more than
600,000 tonnes since early December.
 That pile of unconsummated imports casts a massive shadow
over the world's biggest market for the metal, since it accounts
for roughly 50 percent more than China's own monthly production
of the metal.
 February net imports of primary aluminium and refined zinc
virtually halved from January, although burgeoning Chinese
production implied an overall increase in demand.

 LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - The yen fell back towards its
post-intervention lows on Monday, with speculators wary of
pushing it higher against the dollar in case of more coordinated
selling of the Japanese currency by the Group of Seven nations.
 Traders said the first joint G7 intervention since 2000 on

market wary of more intervention,"" said Hans Redeker, chief fx
strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""The central banks have drawn a line in the sand, and I
think it has made a psychological impact on the markets, which
are unlikely to take dollar/yen down to 76.25 yen again in the
short term.""
 The dollar rose 0.8 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday
to 81.27 yen, helped by demand from model-generated trading
accounts, with traders citing a cluster of offers at 81.30/50
and 82.00, with good demand around 80.50.
 The euro was 0.8 percent higher at 115.11 yen, while the
common currency was flat on the dollar at $1.4164, having hit a
four-month high of $1.42.
 At one point on Friday, the dollar had surged nearly 4
percent on the day to 82.00 yen as G7 central banks undertook
concerted yen selling after the currency jumped to a post-World
War Two record of 76.25 yen to the dollar the previous day.
 Traders and analysts say the Bank of Japan, the European
Central Bank and Bank of Canada together conducted around $32.3
billion worth of yen-selling intervention on Friday. Estimates
for the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve were not
immediately available.
 There has also been market speculation that Japanese
insurers may repatriate funds from abroad to pay policyholders
after the devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11,
although they are thought unlikely to sell a large amount of
foreign assets.
 Intervention has succeeded in bringing down implied
volatility on dollar/yen, with one-month trading back down at
around 12.4 percent, well off the highs of about 21 percent on
Thursday.
 
 RETURN OF CARRY TRADES?
 The yen dipped broadly and the Australian dollar rose over 1
percent to 81.80 yen, with risk sentiment improving despite the
air strikes in Libya by Western powers.. The Aussie also rose 1
percent versus the dollar to $1.0071, helped by the rise in
global stocks
 Analysts said positive risk appetite, expectations that
Japanese money market rates will remain low and the Bank of
Japan putting a cap on the yen's rise meant conditions were
supportive for at least some yen-funded carry trades.
 ""I'm wary of the Aussie because of regional issues such as
natural disasters in Australia, New Zealand and Japan which will
undermine growth,"" said Adrian Schmidt, currency analyst at
Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""Carry trades can be put back on but in places where yields
are more likely to rise and where there's more value such as
Canada, Scandinavia or even the euro.""
 One factor supporting the Japanese currency is that no one
seems to favour the dollar at the moment. The dollar fell to a
15-month low against a basket of major currencies of 75.536
earlier on Monday, hampered by the Federal Reserve's monetary
easing policy.
 The euro briefly hit a four-month high of $1.4200 against
the dollar as the euro zone looked set to officially agree
bolstering its bailout fund at a March 24-25 EU summit.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2011 07:33AM ET</span>",EXCLUSIVE-Delhaize's Serb buy grew on corruption-cable," * Delhaize buying firm linked in 2007 with corruption-cable
 * Cable cites evidence of sweetheart deal with customs
 * Ambassador recommended Serb owner be denied U.S. entry

 By Adam Tanner
 BELGRADE, March 21 (Reuters) - Belgium's Delhaize, which
this month agreed to buy Serbia's largest retail chain from the
most prominent tycoon in the Balkan state, is dealing with a man
whose firm was built up through corruption, according to a U.S.
embassy cable from 2007.
 Tycoon Miroslav Miskovic, the owner of Delta Holding, was
worth a billion dollars in 2007 before the world financial
crisis, according to Forbes, wealth which at the time placed him
among the richest 1,000 people in the world. Earlier this month
he agreed to sell his Delta Maxi supermarket chain to Delhaize,
a retailer, for 932.5 million euros ($1.3 billion), one of the
largest foreign investments ever in the European Union applicant
country.
 The cable, obtained by WikiLeaks and seen by Reuters, cited
evidence the U.S. embassy had obtained that Delta Holding had
prospered because of a sweetheart deal with Serbian customs in
the 1990s. It also recommended that Miskovic be denied
permission to visit the United States, saying his fortune ""was
made on the backs of the Serbian people as they struggled
through crippling sanctions and hyperinflation while he
collected on their misery.""
 Miskovic declined comment on the cable, saying he never
gives media interviews, and Jelena Krstovic, head of Delta's
corporate communications department, also declined to comment in
detail about the allegations, saying only that ""Delta Holdings
has always worked according to Serbian law.""
 Delhaize said in a statement to Reuters it had and would
continue to act ""in full transparency and according to all legal
obligations in the process to acquire 100 percent of Delta Maxi
Group"", adding that the deal clearly has the full support of
Serbia's government. Officials at Delhaize declined to respond
to questions about whether the Belgian company knew of the
allegations when it negotiated to purchase Delta Maxi, or
whether the allegations would affect, or had affected, the
process of the bid.
 Following Yugoslavia's demise in the 1990s, many people with
political connections across the Balkans grew rich during the
war and chaos left by the former Communist state's collapse.
Because Serbia was under international sanctions, there were
considerable opportunities for well-connected business owners to
enrich themselves. Even today, Serbia ranks 78th in Transparency
International's 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, below
countries including Lesotho, Cuba and China.
 Such a past can complicate deals for international
investors. ""Speaking generally, I think the best situation for a
buyer is to actually do due diligence and then not have the
matter raised, because criminal actions have to be brought by
somebody else and in effect it's letting the sleeping dogs
sleep,"" said Ronald Given, managing partner at the law firm
Wolf Theiss in Croatia.
 Luka Dadic, a corporate lawyer with experience in the
Balkans added: ""You are generally liable for the past
wrongdoings of a company, both in a civil and criminal sense.""
Yet actions dating back to the 1990s may fall under the statute
of limitations to offset such a legal risk, he added.

 SWEETHEART DEAL
 As a private company, Delta does not detail its finances,
but the cable, written by the then U.S. ambassador to Serbia
says: ""We now have solid (evidence) that Miskovic was the
beneficiary of egregious political corruption.
 ""He dominates banking, insurance, and consumer goods in
Serbia after obtaining massive wealth as a beneficiary of
official corruption by Slobodan Milosevic in the mid-1990s.""
 Miskovic spent six months in Milosevic's government in 1990.
According to the cable, Yugoslavia's then director of
customs Mihalj Kertes, who was very close to Milosevic, granted
special treatment to Delta, including a 45-day grace period to
pay customs duties. Other firms had to pay on the spot.
 The deal also allowed Delta to unload cargo in Belgrade
rather than at the border, and allowed him to keep the goods in
storage at customs until he needed them, the cable said.
 ""This also gave him an unfair advantage, and in addition
allowed him to benefit from hyperinflation as goods sold much
later on were valued at their invoice amount from the date of
entry,"" the ambassador wrote.
 During the 1990s, Serbia experienced one of the greatest
periods of hyperinflation in history, even introducing a 500
billion dinar bank note in 1993. At the height of the crisis,
prices rose so fast that restaurant diners were asked to pay
their bills at the start of a meal rather than at the end.
 ""Finally, and most damning, Miskovic was allowed to clear
goods through customs simply on the 'promise' that the company
would pay duties within the allotted 45 days,"" the cable
continued.
 ""So whatever customs fees paid by Delta were paid after 45
days of hyperinflation had cut into the bill,"" the document
said.
 According to one customs official cited in the cable, the
firm sometimes paid no duties at all.
 The 2007 U.S. cable said the embassy had obtained a copy of
a 1996 letter from customs director Kertes allowing Delta
special treatment, and the text of the letter was appended to
the cable. A second customs official confirmed to the embassy
the workings of the arrangement, the cable said. Customs
officials contacted by Reuters on Friday did not respond by
Monday.
 ""We think it only fitting that Miskovic, at the very least,
be treated similarly by our consular system, so that he does not
derive the further benefit of access to the U.S. from his
pillaging of Serbia,"" the ambassador wrote.
 Former customs director Kertes was sentenced to jail for
embezzlement last December following an earlier conviction for
his role in an assassination plot against Milosevic's political
rivals.
 According to Delta Holding's website, the company had
turnover of 2.5 billion euros in 2009 and employs 24,000 people.

"
75,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2011 07:01AM ET</span>",Q+A-Risks at each reactor of Japan's stricken plant explained," The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the centre of
Japan's crisis has six reactors. The plant is operated by Tokyo
Electric Power Co (TEPCO).	
 The following summarises the main risks as Japanese
engineers scramble to deal with the worst nuclear crisis since
the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown:	
 GRAPHIC: http://r.reuters.com/muh68r	
 
 WHAT'S THE LATEST?	
 Authorities said they had reconnected all five reactors at
the complex to a power supply. The next step is to see if they
can get power running in each reactor.	
 This would allow TEPCO to restore systems to monitor
radiation and other data and light the control room of the
reactors. Most importantly, they would be able to cool down the
reactors and the spent fuel pools.	
 But their ability to power up the reactors will depend on
the extent of any damage to each unit. For that reason, experts
said it was premature to suggest the crisis had reached a
turning point.	
 
 WHICH REACTORS ARE MOST AT RISK?	
 -- REACTOR No 3: 784-MW (Manufacturer Toshiba)	
 Level 5 severity on the International Nuclear and
Radiologicial Events Scale. Level 7 is the most severe.	
 Smoke was reported as rising temporarily. Some workers were
withdrawn, TEPCO said. The smoke rose from the spent fuel pool,
Kyodo said.	
 Earlier Monday, the nuclear safety agency said pressure was
rising at the reactor and workers were considering venting
pressure from the unit.	
 Power connected to all six reactors, TEPCO said on Monday.
Company checking for damage at the plant's cooling system before
trying to power up.	
 There was an explosion at the reactor last Monday.	
 Last week, authorities said reactor 3 was emitting the most
radiation and so was the biggest priority. A key aim of dousing
was to get water into spent fuel pools, they said.	
 Reactor 3 is the only one that uses plutonium, which is
considered more toxic than uranium, in its fuel mix.	
 -- What are the risks:	
 The major concern is that any steam coming from the plant
will carry radiation into the atmosphere.	
 Chief Cabinet Minister Yukio Edano said on March 16 there
was a ""possibility"" the primary containment vessel, the first
line of defence against a radiation leak, had been damaged,
Kyodo reported. The reactors also have a secondary containment
building. (see below: CONTAINMENT -- WHAT IS IT?)	
 Steam from the spent fuel pool would indicate that water
covering the spent fuel is evaporating, which in turn could mean
the vapour is carrying off radiation.	
 The spent fuel pool presents a significant radiation risk if
its contents are exposed to the atmosphere. When fuel rods are
exposed to the air, zirconium metal on the rods will catch fire,
which could release radiation contained in the fuel, said Arnie
Gundersen, a 29-year veteran of the nuclear industry who is now
chief engineer at Fairwinds Associates Inc.	
 
 -- REACTOR No 2: 784-MW (Manufacturer: GE, Toshiba)	
 Level 5 severity.	
 Power connected to all six reactors, TEPCO says on Monday.	
 Nuclear safety agency said on Monday that smoke was seen
over the reactor, Jiji reported. 
 Last Tuesday, an explosion rocked the plant, damaging a
suppression pool, into which steam is vented from the reactor to
relieve pressure. The roof of the reactor building is damaged,
Jiji news agency reported last week.	
 TEPCO said last Tuesday the fuel rods were fully exposed. An
estimated 33 percent of the nuclear fuel rods have been damaged
at the No 2 reactor, Kyodo quoted TEPCO as saying last
Wednesday.	
 -- What are the risks:	
 When fuel rods are no longer covered in coolant they can
heat up and start to melt, raising the risk of a radiation leak
and in a worst-case scenario a full meltdown.	
 The suppression pool is part of the primary containment
vessel, which is designed to prevent a leak, but the IAEA said
the blast ""may have affected the integrity of its primary
containment vessel.""	
 Still, beyond the primary containment vessel is the
containment building, which is also designed to prevent
radiation from escaping.	
 
 -- REACTOR No 1: 460-MW (Manufacturer GE)	
 Level 5 severity.	
 Power connected to all reactors, TEPCO says on Monday.
System tests are being carried out.	
 An explosion occurred at the reactor on March 12. Kyodo
quoted TEPCO as saying on March 16 that an estimated 70 percent
of the nuclear fuel rods had been damaged.	
 -- What are the risks:	
 The IAEA said on Tuesday the primary containment vessel
appeared intact. If the fuel rods in the reactor are not covered
by coolant, they can heat up and start to melt.	
 
 -- REACTOR No 4: 784-MW (Manufacturer Hitachi)	
 Level 3 severity.	
 -- What is happening:	
 Power connected to all six reactors, TEPCO says on Monday.	
 At the time of the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, the
reactor was undergoing maintenance, Kyodo reported.	
 Last week, Gregory Jaczko, head of the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, told a U.S. congressional hearing the
cooling pool for spent fuel rods at this reactor may have run
dry and another was leaking. 
 Last Tuesday, the spent fuel pool caught fire and caused an
explosion. Japan's nuclear safety agency says the blast
punctured two holes around 8-metres square in the wall of the
outer building of the reactor.	
 -- What are the risks:	
 Exposure of spent fuel to the atmosphere is serious because
there is more radiation in the spent fuel than in the reactor,
said Gundersen. The spent fuel pool is not inside a containment
facility either. 
 ""They need to keep water in those pools because the roof
over the building housing the pools is already damaged and
radiation will escape,"" he said.	
 The pools contain racks that hold spent fuel taken from the
reactor. Operators need to constantly add water to the pool to
keep the fuel submerged so that radiation cannot escape.	
 Exposing the spent fuel to the atmosphere will release
radiation.	
 
 -- REACTOR No 5: 784-MW (Manufacturer Toshiba)	
 The No 5 reactor was safely stopped on Sunday. Temperature
of water inside the reactor fell below 100 degrees Celsius,
achieving a so-called cold shutdown, Kyodo news reported.	
 At the time of the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, the
reactor was undergoing maintenance, Kyodo reported.	
 
 -- REACTOR No 6: 1,100-MW (Manufacturer GE, Toshiba)	
 The No 6 reactor was safely stopped on Sunday. Temperature
of water inside the reactor fell below 100 degrees Celsius,
achieving a so-called cold shutdown, Kyodo news reported.	
 At the time of the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, the
reactor was undergoing maintenance, Kyodo reported.	
 
 WHAT IS THE WIND DIRECTION?	
 Wind and light rain are blowing from the northwest to the
southeast, a direction out across the Pacific Ocean, Japan's
weather agency said on Monday.	
 
 CONTAINMENT -- WHAT IS IT?	
 Each reactor is surrounded by a primary containment vessel.
This is made of strengthened steel four-to-eight inches thick.
It provides the most critical line of defence against leaking
radiation from the reactor.	
 Should there be a breach, there is another, final line of
defence to prevent radiation leaks: a bigger containment
building made of steel and concrete. A breach of the containment
building would release radiation into the atmosphere.

 (Adds U.S. stock futures, fresh quotes, updates prices)
 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose $2 a barrel on
Monday after Western forces launched a second wave of air
strikes on Libya, while in other markets glimmers of hope about
Japan's nuclear crisis shaped sentiment.
 The yen extended losses, with speculators wary of more
coordinated action by the Group of Seven countries after their
first joint intervention in over a decade last week. [FRX/
 Brent crude for May was up $2.02 at $115.95 a barrel by 1115
GMT, while U.S. crude for April gained $1.91 to $102.98 after
the U.N.-mandated attacks on Libya to protect civilians caught
up in a one-month-old revolt against Muammar Gaddafi's forces.
 For stock and bond markets, hopes of progress in averting a
nuclear calamity in Japan was the driving force.
 Engineers rigged power cables to all six reactors at the
Fukushima complex and started a water pump at one of them to
reverse the overheating that has triggered the world's worst
nuclear crisis in 25 years.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was up
1.6 percent at 1115 GMT, with Deutsche Telekom AG catapulting 13
percent higher after AT&T Inc said it planned to buy its
T-Mobile USA business.
 That helped boost the MSCI world share index 0.7 percent,
taking it back into positive territory for the year to date.
 ""The market hates uncertainty and the issues in Japan are
easing which is helping,"" Colin McLean, managing director at
fund group SVM Asset Management in Edinburgh, which has 700
million euros assets under management.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a strong open on Wall
Street, with futures for the S&P 500 up 1.2 percent and Dow
Jones futures up 1 percent.
 The VDAX-NEW volatility index, Europe's main investor fear
gauge, dropped 8 percent as the proposed Deutsche Telekom deal
eclipsed concerns about Western intervention in Libya.
 Safe haven German government bond and U.S. Treasury futures
also fell.
 ""Japan has been definitely considered by the market to be
the more important issue,"" one bond trader said.
 Nonetheless, oil traders will remain on edge after unrest
also flared in Syria and Yemen in the wake of popular uprisings
that toppled long-time leaders in Tunisia and Egypt earlier this
year and a crackdown on protests in Bahrain last week.
 Oil has risen more than a fifth this quarter and the social
unrest in North Africa and the oil-producing Gulf provide enough
uncertainty to keep prices buoyed.
 ""The key is really how Saudi and Iran play out. Cool heads
need to prevail. It's contained at the moment, but if things
worsen, you see a Mideast premium very quickly,"" said Jonathan
Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking Services.
 
 YEN SLIDES
 The dollar rose 0.8 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday
to 81.27 yen, after joint G7 intervention last week
hoisted the greenback nearly 4 percent versus the Japanese
currency.
 The G7 acted after the yen jumped to a post-World War Two
record high of 76.25 yen to the dollar last Thursday. More is
expected to come if it climbs again.
 ""Dollar/yen will be supported in the near term with the
market wary of more intervention,"" said Hans-Guenter Redeker,
chief fx strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""The central banks have drawn a line in the sand and it has
made a psychological impact on the markets which are unlikely to
take dollar/yen down to 76.25 yen again in the short term.""
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average plunged 10 percent
last week as engineers battled to prevent a meltdown and
radiation leak at a nuclear power plant crippled by an
earthquake and tsunami that devastated a swathe of the country.
 Japan's markets were closed for a holiday on Monday but the
MSCI index of Asian stocks outside of Japan rose about 1.4
percent.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - The yen extended losses on
Monday, with speculators wary of pushing it higher against the
dollar as such a move could draw more coordinated yen-selling
intervention by the Group of Seven countries.
 Analysts said the first joint G7 intervention since 2000 on
Friday was working for the moment, and that they saw the effort
as primarily aimed at dampening market volatility. Japan markets
are off on Monday, sapping liquidity even further.
 ""Dollar/yen will be supported in the near term with the
market wary of more intervention,"" said Hans-Guenter Redeker,
chief fx strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""The central banks have drawn a line in the sand, and I
think it has made a psychological impact on the markets, which
are unlikely to take dollar/yen down to 76.25 yen again in the
short term.""
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday
to 81.10 yen , building on gains made in the previous
session, with traders citing stops building in the 80.50 yen
area while offers were at 81.30/50 yen. 
 The euro was also 0.5 percent higher on the yen at 114.93
yen , while the common currency was flat on the dollar
at $1.4163, having hit a four-month high of $1.42.
 At one point on Friday, the dollar had surged nearly 4
percent on the day against the Japanese yen to 82.00 yen as G7
central banks undertook concerted yen-selling.
 The G7's joint intervention on Friday came after the yen
jumped to a post-World War Two record of 76.25 yen to the dollar

barriers and long liquidation by Japanese retail margin-traders
had helped to fuel the U.S. currency's fall against the yen.
 Traders and analysts say the Bank of Japan, the European

billion worth of yen-selling intervention on Friday. Estimates

 The intervention has succeeded in bringing down the implied
volatility on dollar/yen as investors saw less need to hedge
against a further yen rise for now. The implied volatility on
one-month dollar/yen  traded at around 13 percent, well
off the highs of about 21 percent on Thursday. 
 
 RETURN OF CARRY TRADES?
 A trader for a U.S. bank in Hong Kong said the Bank of Japan
is likely to sell the yen again if the dollar drops below 80.00.
 ""You have to think the line in the sand is 80, at least
79.50. It would be embarrassing if it got below there,"" the
trader said.
 The yen dipped broadly and the Australian dollar rose nearly
1 percent to 81.37 yen , with risk sentiment improving
despite the air strikes in Libya by Western powers.
[ID:nLDE72J0RL].
 BNP's Redeker said positive risk appetite and expectations
that Japanese money market rates will remain low, and the Bank
of Japan putting a cap on the yen's rise, meant conditions were
supportive for yen-funded carry trades.
 Traders cited robust demand from Japanese retail investors
in the Australian and New Zealand dollar, both of which are
considered favourites amongst this set of investors.
 One factor supporting the Japanese currency is that no one
seems to favour the dollar at the moment. The dollar fell to a
15-month low against a basket of major currencies of 75.536
<.DXY> earlier on Monday.
 ""The dollar has problems of its own with the Fed loose
monetary policy very much in place and the U.S. grappling with
its own fiscal problems,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabo Bank.
 The euro briefly hit a four-month high of $1.4200 
against the dollar as the euro zone looked set to officially
agree bolstering its bailout fund at a March 24-25 EU summit.

 Moody's Investors Service says in a special report on the
situation in Japan that the downside risks from the earthquake,
tsunami, and nuclear crisis have increased over the past week
for the country's economy, sovereign credit, banking,
insurance, and non-financial corporate sectors
 The report -- published today -- outlines Moody's thinking
on the immediate and long-term credit implications of the
crisis for Japan's financial and corporate sectors, as well as
its macro-economic and sovereign outlooks.
 It also examines the effects of the situation on a host of
sectors,including assessments of the supply chain impacts, such
as for the US auto sector, and US and Asian electronics sector.
 Despite the higher risks, Moody's base-case assumptions
remain broadly unchanged from a week ago: Japan's growth will
resume in 2H2011; investor confidence will continue with regard
to government bonds; the banking system will be resilient; and
the worst-affected sectors will be insurance and utilities,
with others experiencing a limited impact.
 The key assumption underlining this base case is a speedy
containment of the nuclear problem.
 ""We are now more negative in our assessment of the damage.
The crisis has raised the risks facing both Tokyo Electric
Power (A1 on review for possible downgrade) -- as the owner of
the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant at the center of the crisis
-- and Japan's overall utilities sector,"" says Brian Cahill,
Managing Director.
 ""For many other industries, disruptions to power, begun by
the earthquake and now exacerbated by the nuclear crisis, will
cause an interruption to production which is more severe than
we had anticipated. Information on this aspect remains limited,
but is almost entirely negative,"" adds Shinsuke Tanimoto, a
Senior Vice President with the Corporate Finance Group in Tokyo
Tanimoto.
 Thomas Byrne, a Senior Vice President with the Sovereign
Risk Group in Singapore, says, ""If the Japanese government
falters in its efforts to contain the spread of radiation from
Fukushima, a large drop in consumer confidence could ensue,
with negative repercussions for the country's economy.""
 ""If coupled with power shortages that create an extended
delay of a resumption of production to pre-disaster levels, the
country's full-year gross domestic product could contract,""
adds Byrne. ""However, the Japanese government has the fiscal
wherewithal and creditworthiness to deal with a disaster that
could cost twice as much as the Kobe earthquake of 1995.""
 Minoru Kubota, Managing Director for the Financial
Institutions Group in Tokyo, says, ""We estimate that the impact
of the earthquake and related incidents is well within the
Japanese banking system's capacity to absorb. This belief is
based on a combination of the unprecedented liquidity provision
committed by the Bank of Japan; strong bank capital buffers,
which have benefited from a Yen 4 trillion increase since 2009;
and our expectation of public and private investment in the
clean-up and reconstruction.""
 Kenji Kawada, a Vice President and Senior Analyst in Tokyo,
says, ""Insurers, both in Japan and around the world, will
sustain heavy losses, and this will in turn result in negative
credit implications for domestic and foreign insurers, but
especially for the property and casualty sector in Japan and
reinsurers globally. However, we believe the impact for life
insurers will be more manageable.""
 Finally, the Tokyo Corporate Finance Group's Tanimoto,
says, ""The nuclear crisis at Fukushima will prompt a
reevaluation of the country's dependence on nuclear power for
nearly a third of its energy needs.""

87,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2011 02:17AM ET</span>","For some Japanese, tsunami memories go back to 1933"," By Chisa Fujioka and Jon Herskovitz 
 OFUNATO, Japan, March 21 (Reuters) - Teru Suzuki, 86, says
only ""destiny"" kept her alive after last week's magnitude 9.0
earthquake triggered the third big tsunami in her lifetime to
level her quiet fishing town in northeastern Japan.	
 Suzuki is one of a handful of elderly people in the area who
have rebuilt lives after a magnitude 8.1 quake in 1933, a
tsunami from the magnitude 9.5 Great Chilean earthquake in 1960
and a naval attack in the last days of World War Two.	
 Relaxing in her living room when the latest earthquake
struck, she didn't think much of the tsunami warning on
television until her son, who had climbed up a hill to check the
coast, ran back to tell her that a huge wave was coming.	
 Hand in hand, they rushed out to the back of the house to
climb to higher ground, escaping death from Japan's largest
tremor on record.	
 ""I can only think that it was destiny. Three people have
died just from around here,"" Suzuki said, crediting her escape
to her son, a truck driver living near Tokyo who just happened
to be in town for a delivery.	
 ""I just thought, I am not going to let this kill me.""	
 Japan is the most rapidly aging society on earth and remote,
rural areas like Ofunato in hard-hit Iwate Prefecture have a
disproportionate percentage of elderly people.	
 Japanese media have carried reports of very elderly people
being pulled from shattered homes by their sons or daughters,
who are grandparents themselves.	
 
 CONCERN FOR THE ELDERLY	
 A newsletter from the Hawaii-based Center for Excellence in
Disaster Management & Humanitarian Assistance said that although
the number of people in evacuation centers has decreased as
people return home or stay with relatives, ""there is still a
concern for the elderly and sick"".	
 The U.S. Navy, which has deployed 20 ships, 140 aircraft and
12,750 personnel in waters near the disaster zone, on Sunday
delivered more than 16 tonnes of food aid by helicopter to
isolated areas and remote islands, a spokeswoman said.	
 The March 11 quake -- which has left more than 21,000 people
dead or missing and forced 367,000 people to live in shelters --
is Japan's worst on record.	
 For Suzuki, however, the tsunami generated by the Chilean
earthquake thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean in 1960
was a worse tragedy because it took the life of her eldest son.	
 Kazuo, 20 years old at the time, ""tried to escape, carrying
two children from the motorcycle shop he was working for, but he
was washed away"", she said quietly, showing his black-and-white
picture recovered from the latest quake.	
 Others in the area also speak from experience of coping with
disasters.	
 One of the earliest childhood memories for Kenji Sano, 80,
was when he was two and his mother wrapped him in her arms to
flee the 1933 tsunami that destroyed his home in Kamaishi, 40 km
(25 miles) north of Ofunato. They ran to a temple up the street
and his mother grabbed a gravestone to keep from being washed
away.	
 ""At that time, not too many people were killed by the
tsunami, but this time, oh, it was unbelievable. There was a
great earthquake and after two or three minutes the tsunami
came.""	
 Sano's family rebuilt their home in the centre of the city
and rebuilt it again after the same neighbourhood was levelled
in an allied naval bombardment on Aug 9, 1945 -- the same day
the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki.	
 Aid groups are stressing the need for psychological support
for survivors. But for some elderly survivors, the challenge of
rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of natural disasters
makes them stronger.	
 ""People ask me in town, 'Grandma, how old are you?' and I
tell them I'm 18,"" Suzuki said, using a broom to brush off the
dirt on the corner of her living room ceiling that marked where
the seawater had submerged her home.	
 ""I can't get sick until I clean this up.""

(Updates to afternoon Asia)	
 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, March 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped more than
2 percent to top $116 a barrel on Monday as Western forces
launched air strikes on Libya, while Asian shares advanced on
bargain hunting in the wake of heavy losses last week.	
 The yen stayed on the defensive, although waning selling
momentum was making traders wary of the potential for further G7
action to curb the Japanese currency after the first joint
intervention by the grouping in a over decade.	
 Brent crude futures jumped more than 2 percent at
one point in early trade after the United Nations-mandated
attacks on Libya aimed at forcing Muammar Gaddafi to cease fire
on rebels and end attacks on civilians. 
 At 0608 GMT, the leading contract was up 1.5 percent at
$115.69 per barrel. NYMEX crude futures rose 1.85 percent
to $102.94.	
 Unrest in Syria and Yemen over the weekend, following social
unrest across North Africa that toppled national leaders, kept
oil traders on edge.	
 They said crude prices would only spike higher if the
Libyan conflict showed signs of degenerating into a ground war
and for now that looked unlikely.	
 But equally, crude prices are supported by expectations of
Japanese buying of oil and gas to feed power generators in the
wake of its nuclear plant crisis.	
 Oil has risen more than a fifth this quarter and the social
unrest in North Africa and the oil-producing Gulf provide enough
uncertainty to keep prices well bid.	
 ""I can see uncertainty and fear driving the price of oil
higher in the short term,"" said Matthew Lewis, an analyst at CMC
Markets in Sydney.	
 Higher fuel prices will revive investors' concerns about
inflation and the prospect for further interest rate increases,
especially in emerging economies.	
 
 In share dealings, the MSCI index of Asian stocks outside of
Japan rose about 1 percent. Japan's markets were
closed for a public holiday.	
 The benchmark Nikkei share average plunged 10
percent last week as engineers battled to try to prevent a
meltdown and radiation leak at a nuclear power plant crippled by
the quake and tsunami.	
 Shares elsewhere in Asia dropped nearly 3 percent and the
unfolding drama in Japan weighed on markets in the United States
and Europe.	
 Investors kept a wary eye on news from Japan on Monday,
where there were signs of progress in bringing the stricken
power plant back under control. 
 The drop in Asian share prices following Japan's March 11
natural disaster brought equity valuations to average levels and
markets particularly in North Asia are attractive, said Markus
Rosgen, head of Asia ex-Japan strategy at Citigroup.	
 ""From a technical perspective, Asia-ex Japan is very
oversold. Much of the bad news is in the price of Asian equities
and monetary policy is not hugely restrictive,"" said Rosgen, who
predicts the MSCI ex Japan will rise nearly 50 percent from
current levels by the end of the year.	
 Asian shares outside Japan have fallen nearly 5 percent this
quarter, underperforming a rise of more than 2 percent in the
broad S&P 500 stocks index in the United States and the
MSCI world share index , which is flat over the
same period.	
 With the Bank of Japan pumping massive amounts of liquidity
into its money markets to shore up sentiment and the Fed's
quantitative easing showing no signs of abating, markets should
be well supported for now.	
 The yen was largely steady after joint intervention
by the Group of Seven on Friday boosted the dollar against the
Japanese currency by nearly 4 percent.	
 The yen last traded at 80.92 per dollar after the
intervention on Friday pushed it down to 82.00. The central
banks stepped in after the yen surged to a record high of 76.25
on Thursday.	
 ""Japanese officials will look to manage yen volatility,
rather than push prices in a given direction, suggesting renewed
strength may be allowed to progress undeterred provided it
progresses gradually,"" Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at
DailyFX, said in a note.	
 An undertone of caution pushed safe haven plays such as gold
higher, although it stayed well below its record high
around $1,445 an ounce hit earlier this month.	
 In China, interest rate swaps rose while stocks and the yuan
advanced after the central bank unexpectedly raised banks'
reserve requirement ratios for the third time this year after
markets had closed on Friday.

* Money managers need new pilots to understand changed world
* Investing time frames shortened during crises
By Edward Krudy
NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Put away the machines and bring
back the humans. Wall Street is setting aside its algorithms and
complex models and turning to experts for clues on how to make
money in an uncertain world, turned upside down by Japan's
disaster and Middle East uprisings.
For at least one fund manager, that meant hiring a pair of
nuclear physicists.
Turner Investment Partners, which oversees $16 billion in
assets, enlisted the two scientists to help fill the information
void when reports came out of radiation leaking from Japan's
nuclear power plant after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
""We have them so as to ascertain the severity of the leakage
and the risks to other places like Hong Kong, which is 2,000
miles away,"" said David Kovacs, Turner's chief investment officer
who manages money for hedge funds and other investments.
For Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of PIMCO, the world's
largest bond fund with $1.1 trillion under management, making
sense of the fast-changing geopolitical environment meant
traveling personally to the Gulf to learn first hand how people
see the situation and what it implies for the global economy and
markets.
 Both fund managers were grasping for insight, trying to stay
half step ahead of a parade of seemingly contradictory headlines
and gain an edge that can pay off handsomely in today's
lightning-paced markets.
Usually asset managers and hedge funds can use risk models to
help them navigate. But last week they were glued to the news
screens watching headlines and scrambling for reliable
information after Japan's earthquake and tsunami of March 11
turned into a nuclear crisis.
Models didn't work any more. The result was severe market and
investor stress. Volatility, a measure of fear and uncertainty,
leaped last week. The yen rose an eye-popping 8 percent in three
days before central banks intervened. Japan's Nikkei index ended
the week down 10 percent and oil and global stocks see-sawed.
For many big money managers it meant placing very short-term
trades, for fear the world would change again on a dime.
George Soros, the legendary hedge fund manager, once said he
would rely on ""animal instincts"" -- and a pain in his back -- not
models, to tell him when something was wrong with his portfolio.
""The backache didn't tell me what was wrong - you know, lower
back for short positions, left shoulder for currencies - but it
did prompt me to look for something amiss when I might not have
done so otherwise,"" he said in his 1995 autobiography, ""Soros on
Soros.""
""UNKNOWN UNKNOWN""
A wave of shocks the past decade has left Wall Street at times
rudderless -- the Sept. 11. 20011, attacks, a credit crisis that
morphed into a banking crisis and sovereign debt crisis. In the
two and a half years since Lehman Bros collapsed, money managers
and hedge funds have sought a way to deal with such shocks.
For Kovacs, it was a question of developing models that take
into account what he calls the ""unknown unknown.""
""We did not stop using the methodology of our investment
process, but we've changed the risk control concept such that it
reduces the negative impact associated with the unforeseen,"" said
Kovacs.
 In practice, says Kovacs, that means he has relied more on
derivatives to hedge over the last year and a half. ""You have to
have some shock absorbers,"" he said.
 Peter Lee, chief technical strategist at UBS in New York,
describes a herd mentality where short-term hedge funds and high
frequency traders driven by technical targets gravitate towards
widely watched market levels, trying to catch a bounce.
 ""The news flow is all over the map,"" said Lee.
 ""What normally happens off a geopolitical news sell-off is
you get down to an oversold condition and then you have these
short term, very-first-money traders or momentum traders coming
in trying to scalp this market.""
 Investors shorten their time horizon after an unexpected
event because information loses context and it's difficult to
measure the implications. Analyst revisions of earnings estimates
are sketchy at best and economic data is outdated.
 ""People lose their faith in these valuation measures because
they don't know how valid they are anymore, and that's when they
start to trade on more recent types of information,"" said Ed
Peters, a partner at hedge fund FirstQuadrant in Pasadena,
California, where he helps oversee about $18 billion in assets
under management.
 Reverting to outside experts like physicists is one way to
try to fill the information void.
 Turner took the route of shorting stocks of uranium-related
companies including Cameco , which fell nearly 24 percent
to a six-month low during the week.
 ""We did not short the Nikkei, the yen or Japanese equities
because it just would be immoral,"" Kovacs added.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Jeremy Gaunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Investors already
bruised by the Japan disaster now confront military air strikes
on Libya and the prospect of rising oil prices, making it likely
they will postpone any bold investment decisions.
Until a clearer picture emerges, they will want to steer clear
of riskier assets as they recalibrate positions.
One thing seems certain: Oil prices will renew their advance
posing a new challenge for global recovery. Some analysts said
benchmark Brent crude could surge $5 toward the recent
two-and-a-half year peak of $119.79, after closing on Friday at
$113.93 a barrel.
Western forces pounded Libya's air defenses over the weekend
to repel Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from rebel strongholds as
they enforced a U.N. Resolution. The attacks are set to continue
in coming days. Analysts said the strikes create fresh
uncertainty.
""It's an open-ended question because we don't know whether the
air strike on Libya will turn into a quagmire or a quick
victory,' said Boris Schlossberg, a currency strategist at GFT in
New York.
 ""If the situation drags on, this will make investors pull in
their horns because it creates yet another geopolitical hot
point.""
 The United States said on Sunday it expects to conduct more
air strikes on Libya as part of enforcing a U.N. resolution.
 As the Japanese nuclear crisis unfolded last week and the
death toll from the tsunami rose, investors pulled out of riskier
assets pressuring global stocks, while the yen surged on the
prospect of Japanese investors bringing their money home.
 Oil already had advanced last week and further gains could
threaten to manacle future global economic growth. It is enough
to make some longer-term investors freeze, or at least sit on the
sidelines and not make major moves.
 ""The situation is too fluid and too uncertain to warrant
changes,"" Joost van Leenders, strategist at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, said in a note to clients.
 Equity market losses since the earthquake in Japan have been
around 2 percent, as measured by the MSCI World Index. In Tokyo
losses were worse., falling 10 percent. Volatility has risen, but
is still far from where it was during the height of the euro-zone
debt crisis.
 Aside from Libya, Bahrain is also in focus, having cracked
down on mainly Shi'ite Muslim protesters, a move that has angered
Iran and raised tensions in the oil-exporting region. In Yemen,
the president sacked the cabinet after deadly protests. Unrest
shook Syria on Sunday and Saudis gathered to demand the release
of prisoners.
 OIL, JAPAN ARE KEY
 The heart of the uncertainty for investors is what rising oil
prices and Japan's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear breakdown will
mean for the world economy and financial markets.
 The initial reaction to Japan was that the global economy
would cope quite well, seeing only 0.2 percent or so trimmed from
global growth that was running above trend around 4.4 percent.
 But the nuclear crisis and the potential for Japanese
investors to pull money back from world markets -- or at least
not put more in - has raised concerns about the impact on markets
even if Japan does manage a V-shaped recovery.
 ""The direct or first round economic effects of the tsunami
are likely to be relatively contained to Japan, but the financial
market spillovers could have very serious global repercussions,""
Fathom Consulting said.
 Friday's Group of Seven coordinated intervention into
foreign exchange markets to cool the yen was the most vivid
example to date. The yen had been soaring, driven either by
money being repatriated or positioning for it to be.
 Traders are expecting more intervention in the coming
week.
 Investors were also becoming more cautious before the
earthquake, partly as a result of the spike in oil. Some see
the disasters in Japan as confirming that trend.
 ""This is a catalyst for a fairly large shake out,"" said
Graham Neilson, chief investment strategist at Cairn Capital,
referring to risk assets as a whole.
 MORE TESTS AHEAD
 Investors, in the meantime, will get a snapshot of how
higher oil prices are playing into various sectors of the world
economy over the coming week.
 Euro zone PMI manufacturing and services flash estimates on
Thursday, for example, will show whether oil prices have led to
a dent in sentiment.
 The split nature of the U.S. economy should also be on
view, with potentially weak housing data expected Monday and
Tuesday but good durable goods orders Thursday.
 At the end of the week, the EU summit is set to
rubber-stamp an already agreed but surprisingly strong package
of euro zone crisis measures.
 But the euro zone's highly indebted members have enjoyed
little respite from market pressure since the package was
unveiled, with Portugal facing ever rising borrowing costs.
 Bond investors will be looking for clarity on the welter of
conditions attached to the plan for the EFSF to buy bonds from
the primary market and the timetable for implementation.
 And any sign of delays in implementation or watering down
of the final deal risks triggering a fresh sell-off which might
well sweep across the euro zone periphery.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2011 01:20PM ET</span>","WRAPUP 11-WHO warns of ""serious"" food radiation in disaster-hit Japan "," * Radiation in food a ""lot more serious"" than first thought
- WHO
 * Power cables hooked up to all 6 reactors at crippled
Fukushima plant
 * Workers evacuated as smoke rises from badly damaged
reactor
 * U.S. energy secretary says worst of nuclear crisis may be
over
(Adds IAEA, U.N. scientist comment)	
 By Risa Maeda and Kiyoshi Takenaka	
 TOKYO, March 21 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation
said on Monday that radiation in food after an earthquake
damaged a Japanese nuclear plant was more serious than
previously thought, eclipsing signs of progress in a battle to
avert a catastrophic meltdown in its reactors.	
 Engineers managed to rig power cables to all six reactors at
the Fukushima complex, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, and
started a water pump at one of them to reverse the overheating
that has triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.	
 Some workers were later evacuated from one of the most badly
damaged reactors when smoke briefly rose from the site. There
was no immediate explanation for the smoke, but authorities had
said earlier that pressure was building up at the No. 3 reactor.	
 Smoke was also seen at the No. 2 reactor.	
 The March 11 earthquake and tsunami left more than 21,000
people dead or missing and will cost an already beleaguered
economy some $250 billion, making it the world's costliest ever
natural disaster.	
 The head of the U.N. atomic agency said the nuclear
situation remained very serious but it would be resolved.	
 ""I have no doubt that this crisis will be effectively
overcome,"" Yukiya Amano, director general of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told an emergency board meeting.	
 ""We see a light for getting out of the crisis,"" a Japanese
government official quoted Prime Minister Naoto Kan as saying. 
 But news of progress at the nuclear plant was overshadowed
by mounting concern that radioactive particles already released
into the atmosphere have contaminated food and water supplies.	
 ""Quite clearly it's a serious situation,"" Peter Cordingley,
Manila-based spokesman for the World Health Organisation's (WHO)
regional office for the Western Pacific, told Reuters in a
telephone interview.	
 ""It's a lot more serious than anybody thought in the early
days when we thought that this kind of problem can be limited to
20 to 30 kilometres ... It's safe to suppose that some
contaminated produce got out of the contamination zone.""	
 However, he said there was no evidence of contaminated food
from Fukushima reaching other countries. 
 Fukushima is the world's worst nuclear accident since
Chernobyl, but signs are that it is far less severe than the
Ukrainian disaster.	
 ""The few measurements of radiation reported in food so far
are much lower than around Chernobyl in 1986, but the full
picture is still emerging,"" Malcolm Crick, secretary of the U.N.
Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, told
Reuters.	
 
 
 TAP WATER	
 Japan's health ministry has urged some residents near the
plant to stop drinking tap water after high levels of
radioactive iodine were detected.	
 Cases of contaminated vegetables and milk have already
stoked anxiety despite assurances from officials that the levels
are not dangerous. The government has prohibited the sale of
spinach from all four prefectures near the plant and also banned
selling of raw milk from Fukushima prefecture.	
 There were no major reports of contaminated food in Tokyo, a
city of about 13 million people. City officials however said
higher-than-standard levels of iodine were found in an edible
form of chrysanthemum.	
 ""From reports I have heard so far, it seems that the levels
of radioactive iodine and caesium in milk and some foodstuffs
are significantly higher than government limits,"" said Jim
Smith, a specialist in earth and environmental sciences at
Britain's Portsmouth University.	
 ""This doesn't mean that consumption of these products is
necessarily an immediate threat, as limits are set so
that foodstuffs can be safely consumed over a fairly long period
of time. Nevertheless, for foodstuffs which are found to be
above limits, bans on sale and consumption will have to be put
in place in the affected areas.""	
 Japan is a net importer of food, but has substantial exports
-- mainly fruit, vegetables, dairy products and seafood -- with
its biggest markets in Hong Kong, China and the United States.	
 China will monitor food imported from Japan, the Xinhua news
agency said, citing the country's quality control watchdog.
South Korea will expand radioactivity inspection to processed
and dried agricultural Japanese food, from just fresh produce.	
 In Taipei, one of the top Japanese restaurants in the city
is offering diners the use of a radiation gauge in case they
were nervous about the food. 
 
 MELTDOWN	
 The prospects of a nuclear power plant meltdown in the
world's third-biggest economy and its key position in global
supply chains rattled investors worldwide last week and prompted
rare joint currency intervention by the G7 group of rich nations
to stabilise markets. 
 Moody's Investors Service said in a report that the downside
risks from the crisis had increased over the past week for the
economy, sovereign credit, banking, insurance and non-financial
corporate sectors. 
 Tokyo's markets were closed for a holiday on Monday. The
Nikkei index shed 10 percent last week, wiping $350
billion off market capitalisation, and at one point had lost as
much as 20 percent in value.	
 In a much-needed boost for the battered market,
billionaire investor Warren Buffett said the earthquake and
tsunami were an ""enormous blow"" but should not prompt the
selling of Japanese shares. Instead, he called events a ""buying
opportunity"".	
 ""It will take some time to rebuild. But it will not change
the economic future of Japan. If I owned Japanese stocks, I
would certainly not be selling them,"" Buffett said during a
visit to a South Korean factory run by a company that is owned
by one of his funds. 
 
 SITUATION CRITICAL AT PLANT	
 At Fukushima, 300 engineers have worked around the clock
inside an evacuation zone to contain the worst nuclear accident
since Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986.	
 They have been spraying the coastal complex with thousands
of tonnes of sea water so fuel rods will not overheat and emit
more radiation. Hopes for a more permanent solution depend on
electricity cables reactivating on-site water pumps at each of
the six reactors.	
 The most badly damaged reactors are No. 3 and 4, which were
both hit by explosions last week.	
 Official tolls of dead and missing are rising steadily -- to
8,450 and 12,931 respectively.	
 The death toll could jump dramatically since police said
they believed more than 15,000 people had been killed in Miyagi
prefecture, one of four that took the brunt of the tsunami.	
 The 9.0-magnitude quake and ensuing 10-metre (32-ft) tsunami
made more than 350,000 people homeless. Food, water, medicine
and fuel are short in some parts, and near-freezing temperatures
during Japan's winter are not helping.

currency within a narrow band to the euro to secure price
stability. But he has made no secret that his personal
preference would be for Denmark to adopt the euro.
 -- Within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, Denmark's
crown can fluctuate by plus or minus 2.25 percent around a
central rate of 7.46038 per euro, but Bernstein has overseen a
policy that keeps the crown in a much narrower band.
 -- In autumn 2008, the Danish crown came under selling
pressure as foreign investors fled peripheral currencies, and
Bernstein was forced to raise interest rates to support it at a
time when other central banks were slashing rates to bolster
their economies. Foreign reserves were pouring out of Danish
coffers, and Bernstein has said: ""It felt like driving a car
without brakes."" That experience has led Bernstein to advocate
keeping higher foreign-exchange reserves than before.
 -- Bernstein has repeatedly urged the government pursue a
tighter fiscal policy and reduce debt, particularly in view of
the financial challenges of an ageing population.
 -- In 2010, Bernstein was ranked the most influential man in
Denmark outside the government by business magazine Berlingske
Nyhedsmagasin.

Master's in economics from the University of Copenhagen in 1970.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2011 09:53AM ET</span>",PROFILE-Denmark's prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen," Position: Prime Minister of Denmark
 Incumbent: Lars Lokke Rasmussen
 Date of Birth: May 15, 1964
 Term: Rasmussen succeeded Anders Fogh Rasmussen (no
relation) in 2009 as leader of the centre-right Liberal Party
and prime minister in the middle of a four-year term when Fogh
Rasmussen became secretary-general of NATO. Rasmussen must hold
a general election by mid-November 2011 at the latest, and
opinion polls show he will face a tough challenge from the
Social Democrat-led opposition.
 
 Key Facts:
 -- Rasmussen, who was finance minister in 2007-2009, has
struggled to emerge from the shadow of former premier Anders
Fogh Rasmussen who chose him to be his successor.
 -- Inheriting the premiership rather than winning it in an
election has meant that Rasmussen has had to overcome a
credibility gap in the eyes of many Danish voters. A recent
opinion poll showed 73 percent of Liberal Party supporters
considered Fogh Rasmussen the party's best leader, while only 3
percent rated Lokke Rasmussen best.
 -- He became prime minister in spring 2009 shortly after
Denmark slid into its deepest economic crisis since World War
Two, which drove the government into deficit and heavy borrowing
from healthy surpluses.
 -- Rasmussen worked to mitigate the effects of the crisis
but unemployment climbed, public finances weakened, and banks
turned to the state for aid in the form of a deposit guarantee
and injections of capital.
 -- In December 2009, eight months after taking office,
Rasmussen's government hosted the U.N. climate change summit in
Copenhagen, which was roundly criticised as a failure after the
talks abandoned hope of a binding agreement.
 -- Rasmussen's coalition government with the Conservatives
-- like its predecessors since 2001 -- has relied on the
parliamentary support of the right-wing populist Danish People's
Party in exchange for a strict policy on immigration. His plan
to rehabilitate neighbourhoods with large numbers of immigrants
has been dubbed a ""ghetto plan,"" and a points system that would
raise the bar for some immigrants has been among his most
controversial proposals during his tenure.
 -- Born in 1964, Rasmussen entered politics as head of the
Young Liberals and as a municipal councillor in the mid-1980s.
He took a law degree in 1992, won a seat in parliament in 1994
and joined the cabinet as minister for the interior and health
in 2001.

 * Economy reasonably insulated - c.bank governor
 
 (Adds quotes, details, background)
 By Asma Alsharif
 JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, March 20 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's
economy is reasonably insulated from the regional turmoil and
the central bank has seen no abnormal capital outflows, its
governor Muhammad al-Jasser said on Sunday.
 Revolts have been sweeping through the Arab world since
December, shaking the world's top oil exporter's neighbours
Bahrain, Oman and Yemen, while raising debt insurance costs and
pressuring markets across the Gulf.
 When asked about the impact of the regional turmoil on the
economy and capital flows, the Saudi central bank governor told
reporters: ""I think very little because simply, economically you
have to look at what you are exporting and importing.""
 ""I have checked all the numbers and there has not been any
noticeable outflows or abnormal outflows in Saudi Arabia during
the past few weeks so it has been normal business,"" he said on
the sidelines of a financial conference.
 With investors worried by the regional unrest, Saudi
one-year currency forwards held near their highest levels since
January 2009 over past weeks, pointing to a weakening in the
riyal, which is pegged to the dollar, over the next 12 months.
 Saudi five-year credit default swaps have eased from
February highs, but still remain some 74 percent above levels
seen in January before protests began in Egypt.
 Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally and top Arab economy, has escaped
the mass uprisings but some dissent has built up in the kingdom,
whose economy expanded by 3.8 percent in real terms last year.
 On Sunday, dozens of Saudi men gathered outside the interior
ministry in Riyadh undeterred by a heavy police presence, to
demand the release of jailed relatives.
 However, Saudi stocks gained as much as 5.7 percent on
Sunday, boosted by new social spending worth $93 billion,
offered by King Abdullah to ease tensions in the desert kingdom,
where more than 10 percent of Saudis are without a job.
 The overall social package amounts to nearly 30 percent of
economic output when combined with an estimated $37 billion
worth of handouts announced last month.
 Analysts polled by Reuters before the latest spending plan
was released had expected the Saudi economy to expand by 4.5
percent this year.

 TOKYO, March 20 (Reuters) - Ordinary Japanese people are
talking about a new spirit of unity to overcome natural disaster
and potential nuclear catastrophe, but their politicians seem as
divided and static as ever.	
 Disasters can dwarf political differences and create unity,
as it did for Indonesia's separatist Aceh region after the 2004
Asian tsunami, but Japan's new public mood of togetherness has
yet to spread in any real way through the corridors of power.	
 ""We must do what we can ourselves to recover from this
collapse and revitalise,"" said Kotaro Matsuura, a 20-year-old
college student in the Akihabara district of Tokyo, beloved of
computer nerds and tourists alike for its electronics gadgetry.	
 ""I think the feeling of 'let's pull together' will be linked
to a revitalisation of the economy. There is a growing feeling
of wanting to boost Japan,"" Matsuura said.	
 There are few encouraging signs, though, that the disaster
could be a trigger for Japan to put decades of stagnation and
years of policy gridlock behind it, and move ahead with reform.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan attempted on Saturday to capture
the unity spirit when he invited the leader of the main
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to join the cabinet as
deputy premier for disaster relief.	
 But the offer was swiftly rejected.	
 ""Our party intends to continue all-out cooperation for
recovery from the disaster but this idea is an issue not of
disaster measures, but of the framework of the administration
itself,"" LDP President Sadakazu Tanigaki was quoted as saying on
the LDP's website.	
 ""Without prior policy discussions, it was too sudden.""	
 
 HUGE TASK	
 There is no doubting the enormity of the task facing Japan.	
 More than 15,000 people are estimated to have been killed by
the earthquake and 10-metre tsunami which smashed the country's
northeast coast on March 11, wiping whole towns off the map.	
 Economists estimate that rebuilding from the disaster will
cost as much as $200 billion for an economy already burdened
with public debt twice its $5 trillion economy.	
 In addition to the daunting task of relief and rebuilding,
Japan is also struggling to avert nuclear disaster, with one of
its biggest nuclear power plants severely damaged by the tsunami
and leaking radioactivity into the air and the food chain.	
 Even before disaster struck, Japan was struggling to find a
policy path out of two decades of economic stagnation while
coping with the rising welfare costs of a fast-ageing society
and with a ballooning public debt.	
 A divided parliament has not helped.	
 The ruling Democratic Party controls parliament's powerful
lower house but lacks a majority in the upper chamber, which can
block key budget bills and other legislation.	
 Japanese media have now urged the parties to reach out
across the political divide.	
 ""In order for the nation to overcome this crisis, the ruling
and opposition parties need to cooperate and unify their
perspective,"" said an editorial in the Asahi newspaper.	
 Others voiced hopes on an even grander scale, reflecting a
sense of optimism rare in a land better known for deeply
ingrained gloom.	
 ""Prior to the quake, Japan was a timid nation worrying about
its eventual decline,"" wrote Hiroki Azuma, a Waseda University
professor, in an opinion piece in the New York Times.	
 ""But maybe the Japanese people could use the experience of
this catastrophe to rebuild a society bound together with a
renewed trust. While many will revert to their indecisive
selves, the experience of discovering our own public-minded,
patriotic selves that had been paralyzed within a pernicious
cynicism is not likely to fade away.""	
 
 NO FINGER-POINTING	
 Ordinary Japanese have also resisted the temptation to cast
blame, at least for now, despite some local media criticism of
the prime minister's crisis management, including claims he
focused on the nuclear crisis and paid too little attention to
the epic humanitarian disaster.	
 ""Now isn't the time to point fingers,"" said 29-year-old
Saori Masada, who was handing out tourist maps in Akihabara, now
largely empty of tourists after many foreigners fled Japan.	
 ""We can do that later. I just want the government to do a
good job.""	
 But those who take a professional interest in politics, such
as Jesper Koll, director of equity research at JP Morgan
Securities Japan, are not counting on a new political order.	
 ""You need to have strong, unified political leadership that
lasts, not just from one six-month period to the next,"" he said.	
 ""Personally, I'm sceptical.""	
 Steven Reed, a political science professor at Chuo
University in Tokyo, agrees.	
 ""One of the ideas that you get in the mass media and public
is that the politicians should stop fighting and do what's good
for the country,"" he said.	
 ""But there are different opinions about what's good for the
country. They disagree, and then we're back to politics.""

 By Peter Griffiths
 LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Britain would risk its economic
stability if it watered down a programme of tax rises and public
spending cuts aimed at reducing a record budget deficit, finance
minister George Osborne said on Sunday.
 ""That would be a huge mistake for this country,"" he said in
an interview with the BBC.
 ""We would lose economic stability and we would be back in
the mess of wondering what is going to happen tomorrow to
Britain's credit rating. It is not going to happen.
 ""I can say in the Budget later this week I am not going to
be asking for more tax increases or more spending cuts,"" Osborne
added.
 The government has staked its reputation on eliminating the
budget deficit, which has swollen to 10 percent of GDP, by the
time of the next election in 2015. The fate of both coalition
partners -- Conservatives and Liberal Democrats -- also rests on
what state the economy is in four years down the line.
 
 TOO DEEP, TOO QUICKLY
 Opposition politicians accuse the government of jeopardising
the recovery by cutting the deficit too far and too fast, but
the government cites voices of international support -- and
calmer bond markets -- as reason enough to stay the course.
 The independent Office for Budget Responsbility is likely to
downgrade its 2.1 percent 2011 growth forecast, which could
affect borrowing slightly in coming years and will encourage
critics of the government's planned spending cuts.
 The cuts pencilled in to an emergency budget last June will
start to bite in earnest from April, the start of the new fiscal
year. Public sector job cuts are unavoidable and are estimated
to total more than 300,000 over the next four years
 Ministers said on Saturday that Wednesday's budget would
exempt more workers from income tax and use bank levy money to
help young people train for jobs.
 Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, in an
article for The Observer newspaper, said the
Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition would ""set out further
real terms progress towards our goal of taking anyone earning
less than 10,000 pounds out of tax altogether"".
 Osborne indicated there could also be help for motorists
struggling with rising petrol prices.
 ""I can't promise things the country can't afford, but I've
listened to families and I will do what I can to help,"" he said.
 The government will also unveil the results of its
cross-departmental growth review alongside the budget, with an
overhaul of planning rules, red tape and regulation and tax
simplification expected to form the bulk of measures.

 * More than 15,000 feared dead in just one prefecture
(Adds details on power, food)	
 By Taiga Uranaka and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, March 20 (Reuters) - Japan restored power to a
crippled nuclear reactor on Sunday in its race to avert disaster
at a plant wrecked by an earthquake and tsunami that are
estimated to have killed more than 15,000 people in one area
alone.	
 Three hundred engineers have been struggling inside the
danger zone to salvage the six-reactor Fukushima plant in the
world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl 25 years ago.	
 ""I think the situation is improving step by step,"" Deputy
Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro Fukuyama told a news conference.	
 In one remarkable story of survival, an 80-year-old woman
and 16-year-old youth were found alive under the rubble in the
devastated city of Ishinomaki, nine days after the killer
earthquake and tsunami, NHK public TV said, quoting police.	
 At the nuclear plant, workers braving high radiation levels
in suits sealed in duct tape managed to connect power to the No.
2 reactor, crucial to their attempts to cool it down and limit
the leak of deadly radiation.	
 Officials at plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company
(TEPCO) said the workers aimed to restore the control room
function, lights and the cooling at the No. 1 reactor, which is
connected to the No.2 reactor by cable.	
 But rising cases of contaminated vegetables, dust and water
have raised new fears. The government has prohibited the sale of
raw milk from Fukushima prefecture and spinach from another
nearby area. It is considering further restrictions on food.	
 
 Tokyo, just 240 km (150 miles) south of the crippled plant
and where the government said it had found traces of radioactive
iodine, was subdued on Sunday but there was no sense of panic.	
 ""There's no way I can check if those radioactive particles
are in my tap water or the food I eat, so there isn't much I can
really do about it,"" said Setsuko Kuroi, an 87-year-old woman
shopping in a supermarket in the capital with a white gauze mask
over her face.	
 ""I don't plan big changes to my diet. And I only drink
bottled water.""	
 
 RECONSTRUCTION	
 Police said they believed more than 15,000 people had been
killed in Miyagi prefecture, one of four in Japan's northeast
that took the brunt of the tsunami damage. In total, more than
20,000 are dead or missing, police said.	
 The unprecedented crisis will cost the world's third largest
economy up to quarter of a trillion dollars and require Japan's
biggest reconstruction push since post-World War Two. 
 It has also set back nuclear power plans the world over.	
 Economics Minster Kaoru Yosano put the economic damage at
above 20 trillion yen ($248 billion), which was his estimate of
the total economic impact of the 1995 earthquake in Kobe. 
 Government spending was likely to exceed the 3.3 trillion
yen Tokyo spent after Kobe, which up to now has been considered
the world's costliest natural disaster.	
 Japan's crisis spooked markets, prompted rare intervention
by the G7 group of rich nations to stabilize the yen on Friday,
and fuelled concerns the world economy may suffer because of
disrupted supplies to auto and technology industries.	
 Automaker General Motors Co said it was suspending
all non-essential spending and global travel, plus freezing
production at a plant in Spain and cancelling two shifts in
Germany while it assessed the impact of the Japan crisis. 
 Japanese markets will be closed on Monday for a public
holiday.	
 
 ENCOURAGEMENT	
 Encouragingly for Japanese transfixed on work at the
Fukushima complex, the most critical reactor -- No. 3, which
contains highly toxic plutonium -- stabilised after fire trucks
doused it for hours with hundreds of tonnes of water.	
 Plant operator TEPCO said it may take days to
restore power at the No. 3 and No. 4 reactors. Power is needed
to reactivate water pumps to cool fuel rods in the reactors. 
 If the pumps cannot be restarted, drastic measures may be
required such as burying the plant in sand and concrete, as
happened at Chernobyl in 1986, though experts warn that could
take many months. 
 The Japan crisis is already rated as bad as America's Three
Mile Island accident in 1979.	
 Although public fear of radiation runs deep, and anxiety has
spread as far as the Pacific-facing side of the United States,
Japanese officials say levels so far are not alarming.	
 Some airports in Asia have been checking passengers arriving
from Japan for signs of radiation, including Jakarta airport
where officials were using Geiger counters on all those coming
on flights from Japan.	
 Physicians for Social Responsibility, a U.S. non-profit
advocacy group, called for a halt to new nuclear reactors in the
United States.	
 ""There is no safe level of radiation exposure,"" said Jeff
Patterson, a former president of the group.	
 The quake and ensuing 10-metre high tsunami devastated
Japan's north east coastal region, wiping towns off the map and
making more than 360,000 people homeless in a test for the Asian
nation's reputation for resilience and social cohesion.	
 Food, water, medicine and fuel are short in some parts, and
low temperatures during Japan's winter are not helping.	
 The traumatic hunt for bodies and missing people continues.	
 ""This morning my next door neighbour came crying to me that
she still can't find her husband. All I could tell her was,
'We'll do our best, so just hold on a little longer,'"" said fire
brigade officer Takao Sato in the disaster zone. 
 About 257,000 households in the north still have no
electricity and at least 1 million lack running water.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has kept a low profile during
the crisis except for shouting at TEPCO, sounded out the
opposition about forming a government of national unity to deal
with the crisis. 
 But the largest opposition party rejected that.	
 Kan was to visit the affected region on Monday, Kyodo news
agency said.

 By Taiga Uranaka and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, March 20 (Reuters) - Japan made some progress in its
race to avert disaster at a tsunami-damaged power plant, though
minor radiation leaks underlined perils from the world's worst
nuclear crisis since Chernobyl 25 years ago.	
 Three hundred engineers have been battling inside a danger
zone to salvage the six-reactor Fukushima plant since it was hit
by an earthquake and tsunami that also killed 7,653 people and
left 11,746 more missing in northeast Japan.	
 The unprecedented multiple crisis will cost the world's
third largest economy as much as $200 billion and require
Japan's biggest reconstruction push since post-World War Two. 
 It has also set back nuclear power plans the world over.	
 Encouragingly for Japanese transfixed on work at the
Fukushima complex, the most critical reactor -- No. 3, which
contains highly toxic plutonium -- stabilised after fire trucks
doused it for hours with hundreds of tonnes of water.	
 Work also advanced on bringing power back to water pumps
used to cool overheating nuclear fuel, and Kyodo news agency
reported that temperatures at spent fuel pools in reactors No. 5
and 6 were returning to normal.	
 ""We are making progress ... (but) we shouldn't be too
optimistic,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy-general at Japan's
Nuclear Safety Agency.	


 
 Technicians attached a power cable to the No. 1 and No. 2
reactors, hoping to restore electricity later in the day prior
to an attempt to switch the pumps on. 
 They aim to reach No. 3 and 4 soon after that.	
 If successful, that could be a turning point in a crisis
rated as bad as America's 1979 Three Mile Island accident. 
 If not, drastic measures may be required such as burying the
plant in sand and concrete, as happened at Chernobyl after the
world's worst nuclear reactor disaster in 1986, though experts
warn that could take many months and the fuel had to be cooled
first. 
 On the negative side, evidence has begun emerging of
radiation leaks from the plant, including into food and water.	
 Though public fear of radiation runs deep, and anxiety has
spread as far as the Pacific-facing side of the United States,
Japanese officials say levels so far are not alarming.	
 Traces exceeding national safety standards were, though,
found in milk from a farm about 30 km (18 miles) from the plant
and spinach grown in neighbouring Ibaraki prefecture.	
 The Japanese government ordered additional tests and
depending on the results may ban sales and shipments of food
products from areas in the vicinity of the plant.	
 The first discovery of contaminated food since the March 11
disaster is likely to heighten scrutiny of Japanese food
exports, especially in Asia, their biggest market. 
 Tiny levels of radioactive iodine have also been found in
tap water in Tokyo, one of the world's largest cities about 240
km (150 miles) to south. Many tourists and expatriates have
already left and residents are generally staying indoors.	
 Facing criticism of its early handling of the situation,
plant operator TEPCO's president issued a public
apology for ""causing such great concern and nuisance"". 
 Even after restoring power, the company faces a tricky task
reactivating the cooling pumps, with parts of the system
probably damaged from the quake or subsequent explosions.	
 ""The workers need to go through the plant, figure out what
survived and what didn't, what can be readily repaired and get
the cooling systems back up and running to deal with the cores
and the spent fuel pools,"" said David Lochbaum, of U.S. nuclear
watchdog the Union of Concerned Scientists.	
 
 FOREIGN ENCOURAGEMENT	
 Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recognised Japan's
progress during a trip to reassure residents of eastern regions
there was no immediate danger from the nuclear accident.	
 ""Our Japanese colleagues are gradually, not right away and
with mistakes ... getting the situation under control,"" he said
in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. ""The work is being done
properly, in the right way -- 24 hours a day.""	
 Putin proposed freeing up energy for Japan by increasing
Russian gas supplies to Europe so more liquefied natural gas
(LNG) cargoes could go to the Asian nation.	
 U.N. watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
also offered encouragement to Tokyo. Its chief Yukiya Amano, who
is Japanese, hailed the ""strengthening"" of work at the site.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has kept a low profile during
the crisis except for shouting at plant operator Tokyo Electric
Power Co (TEPCO), sounded out the opposition about forming a
government of national unity to deal with the crisis. 
 But the largest opposition party rejected that.	
 
 MOVING EARTH	
 Showing the incredible power of the 9.0 magnitude
earthquake, the largest to hit tremor-prone Japan since accurate
records began in the early 1900s, Oshika peninsula in Miyagi
prefecture shifted a whole 5.3 metres (17 ft) east and its land
sank 1.2 metres (4 ft).	
 The quake and ensuing 10-metre high tsunami devastated
Japan's north east coastal region, wiping towns off the map and
making more than 360,000 people homeless in a test for the Asian
nation's reputation for resilience and social cohesion.

 By Matt Falloon
 LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Britain's budget next week will
exempt more workers from income tax and use bank levy money to
help young people train for jobs, ministers said on Saturday.
 The budget, billed as pro-growth and pro-reform, will stick
broadly to deficit reduction plans set out last year under which
a record budget deficit running close to 10 percent of national
output will fall sharply by the next election in 2015.
However, the independent Office for Budget Responsbility is
likely to downgrade its 2.1 percent 2011 growth forecast, which
could affect borrowing slightly in coming years and will
encourage critics of the government's planned spending cuts.
 Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, in an
article for The Observer newspaper, said the
Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition would ""set out further
real terms progress towards our goal of taking anyone earning
less than 10,000 pounds out of tax altogether"".
 The coalition has already raised the personal allowance
threshold for income tax, up to which no tax is paid, to 7,475
pounds ($12,070) from 6,475 pounds. The budget on Wednesday is
expected to lift it to around 8,000 pounds.
 Writing in the News Of The World newspaper, finance minister
George Osborne said it would be a ""disaster"" if he abandoned his
austerity plan, but said the budget would still help to create
the conditions for recovery and support those in need.
 ""I'll be using some of the money our new government has
raised from taxing the banks to create the most apprenticeships
this country has ever seen, and a big expansion of work
experience places,"" Osborne said.
 The youth package is expected to total 300 million pounds,
divided between 50,000 new apprenticeships and 100,000 work
experience places. The bank tax will yield 2.5 billion pounds
per year.
 Osborne indicated there could also be help for motorists
struggling with rising petrol prices.
 ""I can't promise things the country can't afford, but I've
listened to families and I will do what I can to help,"" he said.
 The government will also unveil the results of its
cross-departmental growth review alongside the budget, with an
overhaul of planning rules, red tape and regulation and tax
simplification expected to form the bulk of measures.
 Critics have expressed concern that such changes will do
little to boost growth given the harsh fiscal tightening in
train and the prospect of tighter monetary policy this year.

 * More than 7,600 dead, nearly 11,750 missing
(Adds IAEA, GM)	
 By Taiga Uranaka and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, March 20 (Reuters) - Japan saw some success
in its race to avert disaster at a tsunami-damaged
power plant, though minor radiation leaks underlined
perils from the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl 25
years ago.	
 Three hundred engineers have been battling inside
a danger zone to salvage the six-reactor Fukushima plant since
it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami that also killed
7,653 people and left 11,746 more missing in
northeast Japan.	
 The unprecedented multiple crisis will cost the world's
third largest economy nearly $200 billion and require
Japan's biggest reconstruction push since post-World War
II. 
 It has also set back nuclear power plans the world over.	
 Encouragingly for Japanese transfixed on work at the
Fukushima complex, the most critical reactor -- No. 3 which
has highly toxic plutonium -- stabilised after fire trucks
doused it for hours with hundreds of tonnes of water. 
 Work also advanced on bringing power back to water pumps
used to cool overheating nuclear fuel.	
 ""We are making progress ... (but) we shouldn't be too
optimistic,"" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy-general at Japan's
Nuclear Safety Agency.	


 
 Technicians attached a power cable to the No. 1 and No. 2
reactors, hoping to restore electricity later in the day prior
to an attempt to switch the pumps on. 
 They aim to reach No. 3 and 4 soon after that.	
 If successful, that could be a turning point in a crisis
classed as bad as America's 1979 Three Mile Island
accident. 
 If not, drastic measures may be required such as burying the
plant in sand and concrete as happened at Chernobyl after the
world's worst nuclear reactor disaster in 1986.	
 Facing criticism of its early handling of the situation,
plant operator TEPCO's president issued a
public apology for ""causing such great concern and nuisance"". 
 Even after restoring power, the company faces a tricky
task reactivating the cooling pumps, with parts of the system
probably damaged from the quake or subsequent explosions. 
 ""The workers need to go through the plant, figure out what
survived and what didn't, what can be readily repaired and get
the cooling systems back up and running to deal with the cores
and the spent fuel pools,"" said David Lochbaum, of U.S. nuclear
watchdog the Union of Concerned Scientists.	
 
 FOREIGN ENCOURAGEMENT	
 Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recognised
Japan's progress during a trip to reassure residents of
eastern regions there was no immediate danger from the nuclear
accident.	
 ""Our Japanese colleagues are gradually, not right away and
with mistakes ... getting the situation under control,"" he said
in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. ""The work is being done
properly, in the right way -- 24 hours a day.""	
 Putin proposed freeing up energy for Japan by
increasing Russian gas supplies to Europe so more liquefied
natural gas (LNG) cargoes could go to the Asian nation. 
 U.N. watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) also offered encouragement to Tokyo. Its chief Yukiya
Amano, who is Japanese, hailed the ""strengthening"" of work at
the site. 
 On the negative side, evidence has begun emerging
of radiation leaks from the plant, including into food and
water.	
 Though public fear of radiation runs deep, and anxiety has
spread as far as the Pacific-facing side of the United States,
Japanese officials say levels so far are not alarming.	
 Traces exceeding national safety standards were, though,
found in milk from a farm about 30 km (18 miles) from the plant
and spinach grown in neighbouring Ibaraki prefecture. 
 The first discovery of contaminated food since the March 11
disaster is likely to heighten scrutiny of Japanese food
exports, especially in Asia, their biggest market. 
 Tiny levels of radioactive iodine have also been found in
tap water in Tokyo, one of the world's largest cities about 240
km (150 miles) to south. Many tourists and expatriates have
already left and residents are generally staying indoors.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has kept a low profile during
the crisis except for shouting at plant operator Tokyo Electric
Power Co (TEPCO), sounded out the opposition about forming a
government of national unity to deal with the crisis. 
 But the largest opposition party rejected that.	
 
 MOVING EARTH	
 Showing the incredible power of the 9.0 magnitude
earthquake, the largest in tremor-prone Japan's recorded
history, Oshika peninsula in Miyagi prefecture shifted a whole
5.3 metres (17 ft) east and its land sank 1.2 metres (4 ft).	
 In contrast to the generally traumatic and negative images
so far, one video emerged showing the crew of a Japanese
coastguard vessel successfully riding a massive wave by turning
the bow directly at the wall of waters. 
 The quake and ensuing 10-metre high tsunami devastated
Japan's north east coastal region, wiping towns off the map and
making more than 360,000 people homeless in a test for
the Asian nation's reputation for resilience and social
cohesion.	
 Food, water, medicine and fuel are short in some parts, and
low temperatures during Japan's winter are not helping.	
 The traumatic hunt for bodies and missing people continues.	
 ""This morning my next door neighbour came crying to me that
she still can't find her husband. All I could tell her was,
'We'll do our best, so just hold on a little longer,'"" said fire
brigade officer Takao Sato in the disaster zone.	
 About 257,000 households in the north still have no
electricity and at least one million lack running water.	
 Japan's crisis spooked markets,
prompted a rare intervention by the G7 group of rich nations to
stabilize the yen on Friday , and may disrupt
supplies to auto and technology markets. 
 Automaker General Motors Co said it was
suspending all nonessential spending and global travel, plus
freezing production at a plant in Spain and cancelling two
shifts in Germany while it assessed the impact of the Japan
crisis.

 KYOTO, Japan, March 19 (Reuters) - China asked Japan on
Saturday for prompt and complete information on Japan's nuclear
crisis, amid some criticism of Tokyo's handling of the
situation.	
 Japan is struggling to deal simultaneously with natural
disaster and a possible nuclear disaster, after a quake and
tsunami smashed its northeast coast on March 11, killing more
than 10,000 people and wrecking a major nuclear power plant.	
 Japan's neighbours have all offered help and expressed
sympathy for its plight, but there has been some criticism at
home and abroad at the level of information and the handling of
the nuclear crisis, especially in its early stages.	
 Japan's foreign minister said after talks with his Chinese
and South Korean counterparts in Japan's ancient capital of
Kyoto that Beijing was concerned about information-sharing.	
 ""I said we shared information as best as we can, but that I
would work to strengthen that,"" Takeaki Matsumoto said after the
brief talks, which had been scheduled before the quake struck.	
 ""We've been forthcoming but they have requested prompt and
complete sharing of information,"" he told reporters.	
 Matsumoto also confessed that he could not be optimistic
about the events unfolding at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi
power plant, where radioactive steam and possibly smoke have
been rising into the air above what is left of the complex.	
 Asked what he had told South Korean Foreign Minister Kim
Sung-hwan and Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi about the nuclear
plant, he said: ""I told him the truth that I can't say I'm
optimistic, but we are sparing no efforts to correct the
situation.""	
 In the talks, which included bilateral meetings and lasted
only a few hours, the three nations also agreed to work together
to increase nuclear-power safety, though they gave no details.	
 Previously, the three neighbours' discussions on nuclear
issues had been confined almost exclusively to reining in North
Korea's nuclear programme.

 By Chang-Ran Kim	
 TONO, Japan, March 19 (Reuters) - More than a week after an
earthquake and tsunami smashed much of Japan's northeast coast
to pulp, a small tourist town tucked safely between mountains
has ground nearly to a halt. 
 Tono, a city of 30,000 about 30 km (20 miles) from the
Pacific, usually enjoys a steady flow of visitors attracted to
the birthplace of much Japanese folklore, including ghoulish
tales of mountain spirits and mythical creatures.	
 ""Since the earthquake on March 11, we haven't had a single
visitor,"" laments local tourism board official Shinichi
Tachibana at the city's main rail station. It closed for service
after the tremor damaged train tracks.	
 Instead of renting its 120 bicycles to visitors, the
city-run tourist office now lends them for free to locals forced
to keep cars parked due to the sudden shortage of fuel.	
 Petrol stations on the main street are roped off.	
 Not even emergency vehicles can obtain fuel without a
special permit by the regional government, and even then
sometimes only five litres at a time, says an attendant. 
 Across much of the northeast, which is reeling from the
double impact of an earthquake and tsunami, two-hour waits are
common at the few fuel stations open to individuals.	
 While Tono's population is relatively small, the city covers
an area bigger than all Tokyo's 23 wards combined, so getting
around without a car is difficult. 
 
 ECONOMIC IMPACT	
 Without tourism, this sleepy town -- like many others in the
northeast -- could be in for a long and heavy blow to an economy
that had already declining due to the shrinking population.	
 ""It's probably going to get worse now,"" says Eiko
Niisato, 69, who runs a small tofu food business with her
husband and son. 
 She is under no illusions that the government will step in
to help, knowing the devastated coast and crisis at the
Fukushima nuclear power plant demand more attention.	
 ""The government itself has no money, and the whole country
is in crisis. We'll do what we can to survive, because what else
is there to do?""	
 Niisato is, however, among the lucky ones right now in Tono.
Her family business is at least enjoying a temporary boom since
out-of-town wholesalers are unable to deliver to the big
supermarkets.	
 Elsewhere, though, small businesses on side
streets are mostly shuttered, and the streets are empty of
pedestrians and cars.	
 A handwritten sign at a dimly lit butcher shop advertises
it is open for business, but only two blocks of meat remain.	
 Major supermarkets are open, but shelves have been emptied
of frozen foods, milk and many other products.	
 ""Three days ago I bought a bicycle and I'm using it for
commuting,"" says Katsuhiro Tada, a 32-year-old builder who
cycled to the supermarket from his workplace. 
 The home depot centre where he purchased his bicycle is now
out of stock, he says.	
 A nearby barber shop is also open but proprietor Fujiko
Segawa is watching television with a friend rather than cutting
hair. ""I guess it must be the earthquake,"" she says.	
 The tourism board's Tachibana says he has no idea when Tono
might return to normal. ""I guess we're stuck until the trains
start running. Who knows when that'll be?""

 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Kevin Krolicki	
 TOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - Exhausted engineers attached a
power cable to the outside of Japan's tsunami-crippled nuclear
plant on Saturday in a desperate attempt to get water pumps
going that would cool down overheated fuel rods and prevent the
deadly spread of radiation.	
 Even one bit of good news was quickly dashed, adding to the
growing despondancy. Media reports said that a young man had
been pulled alive from the rubble eight days after the quake and
tsunami had ripped through northeast Japan and triggered the
nuclear crisis.	
 It turned out that the man been in an evacuation centre and
had simply returned to his ruined home, where he lay down alone
in a blanket.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has called the crisis the
biggest to hit Japan since World War Two, sounded out the
opposition about forming a government of national unity to deal
with a crisis that has shattered Japan and sent a shock through
global financial markets, with major economies joining forces to
calm the Japanese yen. 


 Further cabling was under way before an attempt to restart
water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods at the
six-reactor Fukushima plant in northeastern Japan, 240 km (150
miles) north of Tokyo and prevent more radiation leaks.	
 Officials expect to have power from outside drawn to No. 2
reactor first. Then they will test the pump and systems to see
if they can be started.	
 Working inside a 20-km (12-mile) evacuation zone at
Fukushima, nearly 300 engineers got a second diesel generator
attached to No. 6 working, the nuclear safety agency said. They
used the power to restart cooling pumps on No. 5. Reactor No. 6
was drawing power from a second diesel generator.	
 ""TEPCO has connected the external transmission line with the
receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can
be supplied,"" the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co
, said in a statement.	
 Nearly 1.5 km (a mile) of cable is being laid before
engineers try to crank up the coolers at reactor No.2, followed
by numbers 1, 3 and 4 this weekend, company officials said. 
 ""If they are successful in getting the cooling
infrastructure up and running, that will be a significant step
forward in establishing stability,"" said Eric Moore, a nuclear
power expert at U.S.-based FocalPoint Consulting Group. 
 If that fails, one option is to bury the sprawling
40-year-old plant in sand and concrete to prevent a catastrophic
radiation release. The method was used to the Chernobyl reactor
in 1986, scene of the world's worst nuclear reactor disaster.	
 Underlining authorities' desperation, fire trucks sprayed
water overnight in a crude tactic to cool reactor No.3,
considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides,
or mox, containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium.	
 Japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis
to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level INES international scale,
putting it on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in
Pennsylvania in 1979. Some experts say it is more serious.	
 Chernobyl, in Ukraine, was a 7 on that scale.

 HUMANITARIAN EFFORT	
 The operation to avert large-scale radiation has
overshadowed the humanitarian aftermath of the 9.0-magnitude
quake and 10-metre (33-foot) tsunami that struck on March 11.	
 Nearly 7,000 people have been confirmed killed in the double
natural disaster, which turned whole towns into waterlogged and
debris-shrouded wastelands. 
 Another 10,700 people are missing, many feared dead. 
 Some 390,000 people, many elderly, are homeless, living in
shelters in near-freezing temperatures in northeastern coastal
areas. 
 Food, water, medicine and heating fuel are in short supply
and a Worm Moon, when the full moon is closest to Earth, could
bring floods to devastated areas.	
 ""Everything is gone, including money,"" said Tsukasa Sato, a
74-year-old barber with a heart condition, as he warmed his
hands in front of a stove at a shelter for the homeless. 
 Health officials and the U.N. atomic watchdog have said
radiation levels in the capital Tokyo were not harmful. But the
city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many
Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material.	
 ""I'm leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally
think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world
has ever seen,"" said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at
Narita international airport using his laptop.	
 Officials asked people in the 20 km ""take cover"" zone to
follow some directives when going outside: Drive, don't walk.
Wear a mask. Wear long sleeves. Don't go out in the rain.	
 Though there has been alarm around the world,
experts say dangerous levels of radiation are unlikely to
spread to other nations.	
 The U.S. government said ""minuscule"" amounts of radiation
were detected in California consistent with a release from
Japan's damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern.	
 Amid their distress, Japanese were took some heart from the
279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing
masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape. 
 ""My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are
doing,"" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan's Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. 
 
 G7 INTERVENTION FOR YEN 
 The Group of Seven rich nations succeeded in calming global
financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a
soaring yen -- the first such joint intervention since the group
came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000.	
 Japan's Nikkei share index recovered some lost
ground by the end of a week which wiped $350 billion off market
capitalisation.	
 The government plans to provide up to 10 trillion yen ($127
billion) in cheap loans to help businesses get back on their
feet. The plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap
that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas, the Nikkei
daily reported.	
 But the immediate problems remained huge for many people.
Nearly 290,000 households in the north still have no electricity
and about 940,000 lack running water.	
 Aid groups say most victims are getting help, but there are
pockets of acute suffering.	
 ""We've seen children suffering with the cold, and lacking
really basic items like food and clean water,"" Stephen McDonald
of Save the Children said in a statement.

 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, March 18 (Reuters) - Brazil's real and Chile's
peso surged on Friday, underscoring the potential of the
region's strong currencies and attractive debt yields to bounce
back if global jitters about Japan and oil prices ease.
 Chile's currency was given a boost by an aggressive
interest rate hike, while the real surged after initial fears
appeared unfounded that panicked Japanese investors would pull
out of big bets on the currency.
 The sharp drops seen in Latin American currencies have
provided an attractive level for investors to put on fresh bets
for further gains -- as long as sentiment over Japan's nuclear
crisis and unrest in the oil-producing Arab world eases.
 ""Investors in emerging markets are now pretty underweight,
so conditions are in place for some risk to start being put
on,"" said Eduardo Suarez, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto.
 While the potential is there, Suarez stressed that risk
appetite has become a ""day to day"" affair.
 But Latin American economies are performing so strongly
that Japan's earthquake disaster and turmoil in the Arab world
pose only mild risks to the region and might even help
policymakers control inflation, economists say.
[ID:nN18290632]
 Brazil's real  bid 0.95 percent stronger at 1.668 per
dollar, bouncing back from sharp losses in the previous session
when it was hurt by fears about Japanese repatriation of
funds.
 But banks like Nomura and Citigroup said they saw no sign
of outflows and noted that Japanese investors had even put on
further bets in favor of the real this week.
 Brazil is offering among the highest interest rates in the
world, which has spurred billions of dollars in bets in favor
of further gains.
 Riskier assets like global stocks and emerging market
currencies managed a second day of gains as concerns of a
nuclear catastrophe appeared to ease after there were no
further fires or explosions at quake-damaged reactors in
Japan.
 A cease-fire in Libya in response to a U.N. resolution
could also ease the flow of capital to safe-haven bets and
further strengthen emerging markets currencies.
 Chile's peso  rose 1.06 percent to 481.10 per
dollar in reaction to the central bank's surprise 50 basis
point rate hike to 4.00 percent late on Thursday. Most
economists had been expecting a 25 basis point hike.
 Higher interest rates in Chile are seen luring foreign
investors eager to reap the benefits of bigger differentials
with lower interest rates in countries like the United States.
 Mexico's peso   firmed 0.35 percent to 12.0450
per dollar.
 ""We have had a bad week, but now people are not buying the
bad news and they are thinking the nuclear problem may be
fixed,"" said Alfredo Puig, a trader at brokerage Vector in
Monterrey.
 The cost of dollars in pesos rose past its 100-day simple
moving average late on Wednesday, but it has snapped back to
trade below its 20-day average.
 In minutes published on Friday, Mexican central bankers
were increasingly concerned about risks from crop losses after
local frosts and high commodity prices, and some market players
increased bets that the central bank could hike interest rates
later this year. [ID:nN18288397]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven on Friday
launched its first coordinated currency market intervention
since 2000 and pledged to do more if needed to rein in a
soaring yen, but investors betting on a sustained decline in
the Japanese currency could be disappointed.
 Both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada said they had
sold yen, bolstering European and Japanese efforts to weaken
the currency and calm markets after Japan's devastating
earthquake, tsunami and unfolding nuclear crisis.
 The dollar rose nearly 4 percent to 82.00 yen on trading
platform EBS  in European trade, but hedge funds and
other speculative accounts tested official resolve by buying
into the yen sell-off. The dollar last traded at 80.58 yen,
though still up 2.4 percent on the day.
 ""We still think that there will be appreciation pressure on
the yen,"" said David Mann, head of research, Americas, at
Standard Chartered in New York. ""I would expect strong defense
of 80. We can't rule out testing below that and then seeing
intervention push it back higher again.""
 C.J. Gavsie, director of FX sales at BMO Capital Markets in
Toronto, said since North American trading hours began, there
had been ""straightforward pressure to be buying yen and selling
dollars, which is exactly the opposite"" of what central banks
were trying to achieve. As a result, the dollar quickly
retreated below 81 yen.
 Tokyo market estimates had the Bank of Japan selling some 2
trillion yen ($25 billion) over the course of the day. Nomura
Securities estimated the European Central Bank intervened to
the tune of about 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion).
 The Bank of Canada was estimated to have spent around C$100
million to C$150 million ($101.5 million to $152.3 million),
according to BMO Capital.
 Expectations that Japanese retail and corporate investors
would start bringing money home for rebuilding after the
disaster drove the yen up this week. So did heavy selling by
margin traders who were forced to unwind positions funded with
cheaply borrowed yen as risk aversion spiked.
 While official yen-selling could continue for weeks,
analysts emphasized that the main goal of intervention is to
reduce volatility but not necessarily to weaken a currency.
 Central banks ""want to make sure the speculative element is
at a minimum,"" said David Watt, senior currency strategist at
RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. ""And they want to make sure
that operationally, the market will always have another side.""
 YEN LONGS TO FALL
 Net yen long positions rose to 30,230 contracts from last
week's 16,656 contracts, data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed on Friday. Analysts expect yen longs
to drop after Friday's intervention. For more, see
[ID:nN18138930]
 Technical analysts noted upside targets around Monday's
peak of 82.45, followed by the 100-day moving average of 82.61
and 83.30, the intraday high from last Friday. Nomura currency
strategists said the 82.70-83.00 range would be an ""ideal
level"" for computer-driven model accounts to buy dollars.
 Giuseppe Manieri, principal of Premium Currency Advisors,
said Friday's closing level is important. ""If it is on the
higher side of the weekly bar,"" it might mean a reversal.
 ""For now on the long-term side nothing has changed, the
trend is still heavily downwards,"" he said. Zurich-based
Premium Currency Advisors has $875 million under management.
 Paresh Upadhyaya, strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch, said it
may require a move toward higher interest rates in the United
States to sustain downward yen momentum.
 ""For intervention to be successful, it needs to be followed
by policy action,"" he said. ""If the Fed starts openly debating
exiting quantitative easing, that would move interest rate
differentials sharply in favor of the dollar against the yen.""
 CURRENCY OPTIONS
 As the dollar rebounded, it became cheaper to hedge against
further yen gains. Implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen
options stood at 13.15 percent, down from 21 percent on
Thursday.
 In currency ETF options, volume on the CurrencyShares
Japanese Yen Trust  was four times the average daily
turnover with about 15,000 puts and 5,811 calls traded,
according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
 Options on the Proshares UltraShort Yen Fund  turned
busy for a second straight session. Overall volume of the fund
was 6.6 times the average daily levels with about 13,000 calls
and 430 puts traded on Friday, according to Trade Alert.
 The euro hit a session high around 115.56 yen 
before easing to 114.36, up about 3.4 percent.
 The euro rose to a four-month high against the dollar of
around $1.4185  after the intervention in euro/yen.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on
Friday as traders took on riskier investments following a
Libya ceasefire that reduced tension in the region, and after
several central banks intervened to stabilize the yen.
 Trading capped a week of extreme volatility marked by Wall
Street's gauge of anxiety, the VIX, which on Thursday soared
to its highest level since July. Stock market volumes surged
on down days and fell on up days.
 Although Wall Street finished Friday's session higher, all
three major U.S. stock indexes ended the week in the red. The
benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.9 percent, its biggest weekly decline
since November.
 World shares as measured by the MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>
advanced 0.6 percent. That gain helped the index erase some of
its 5.6 percent drop over the past six trading days and
brought the index near even for 2011.
 Oil fell from earlier highs after Libya declared a
ceasefire in the country to protect civilians and comply with
a United Nations resolution passed overnight. It had surged
after the U.N. Security Council endorsed a no-fly zone for
Libya, and authorized ""all necessary measures"" to protect
civilians against Gaddafi's forces. [ID:nLDE72H00K]
 ""That (Mideast unrest) quieting down and Japan quieting
down will lead to buying,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing
director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
 Brent crude  had jumped above $117 a barrel on
worries of escalating unrest in oil-rich countries after the
U.N. action to contain Libya's Muammar Gaddafi.
 Brent for May delivery dropped to around $114 after the
ceasefire was declared; the contract settled at $113.93 a
barrel, down 97 cents. U.S. crude fell 35 cents to end at
$101.07 a barrel.
 The dollar climbed 2.6 percent to 80.86 yen, retreating
from a session high of around 82 yen , following the G7
announcement to intervene to stop the currency's sharp rise in
recent days.
 The show of solidarity by the G7 major developed economies
to support Japan through its biggest crisis since World War
Two comes a day after the yen soared to a record 76.25 per
dollar in chaotic trading. It is the first coordinated
currency intervention by the G7 in a decade.
 The G7 ""is just helping sentiment, and stocks sensitive to
risk will push on. But optimism is going to be guarded as
there are no firm resolutions surrounding the Japanese nuclear
crisis and the Middle East, and anything can happen on the
weekend,"" said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index in
London.

 Financial stocks rose after the Federal Reserve notified
some of the largest U.S. banks that they passed a second round
of stress tests. The central bank said it would let some of
those banks use some of their massive capital cushions to buy
back shares, repay the government and boost dividends.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Wells Fargo & Co. 
are among those planning dividend boosts. JPMorgan's stock
gained 2.6 percent to $45.74, while Wells Fargo shares added
1.5 percent to $31.83.
 ""There's a lot of bad things going on in the world right
now and if (the Fed) can show the big American banks are doing
pretty well, that is a good thing to show,"" said Frank
Bonaventure, a partner at Ober Kaler in Baltimore and former
counsel for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
 Industrial shares also rose on bets they could benefit in
Japan's rebuilding effort. General Electric Co  rose 0.2
percent to $19.25, while Caterpillar  advanced 1.9
percent to $105.06.
 Before the start of U.S. trading, European equities pared
earlier gains after China's central bank raised lenders'
required reserve ratios. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose
0.2 percent to close at 1,088.82.
 YEN AND BONDS DROP, GOLD GAINS
 The euro  rose 3.4 percent to 114.50 yen, after
climbing to a session high of 115.56 yen earlier. Some traders
noted the scale of intervention was so far a tame effort to
stem the yen's surge.
 The euro  rose to a four-month high against the
dollar of about $1.4184 after the euro/yen intervention.
 Some market observers said even massive official selling
might not restrain the yen for long, pointing to Japan's last
intervention in September 2010 when it sold a huge 2.1
trillion yen, or around $25 billion worth, but only managed to
push the dollar up to 85.77 yen from 82.85 yen.
 ""It would need to be concerted and aggressive ... and even
then I'm skeptical,"" said Richard Wiltshire, a currency trader
at ETX Capital in London.
 A New York Federal Reserve spokesman said the U.S. central
bank had joined the G7 in intervening to weaken the yen.
 Demand for the safety of government debt waned.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 dipped 3/32, nudging its yield up 0.01 percentage
point to 3.27 percent.
 Gold  rose $16.09 to $1,418.40 an ounce, but was off
a record high of around $1,444 reached last week.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven on Friday
launched its first coordinated currency market intervention
since 2000 and pledged to do more if needed to rein in a
soaring yen, but investors betting on a sustained decline in
the Japanese currency could be disappointed.
 Both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada said they had
sold yen, bolstering European and Japanese efforts to restrain
the yen and calm markets after Japan's devastating earthquake,
tsunami and unfolding nuclear crisis.
 The dollar rose nearly 4 percent to 82.00 yen on trading
platform EBS  in European trade, but hedge funds and
other speculative accounts tested official resolve by buying
into the yen sell-off. The dollar last traded just below 81
yen, though still up 2.7 percent on the day.
 ""We still think that there will be appreciation pressure on
the yen,"" said David Mann, head of research, Americas, at
Standard Chartered in New York. ""I would expect strong defense
of 80. We can't rule out testing below that and then seeing
intervention push it back higher again.""
 Tokyo market estimates had the Bank of Japan selling some 2
trillion yen ($25 billion) over the course of the day. Nomura
Securities estimated the European Central Bank intervened to
the tune of about 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion). The Bank of
Canada is estimated to have spent around C$100 million to C$150
million ($101.5 million to $152.3 million), according to BMO
Capital Markets.
 C.J. Gavsie, director of FX sales at BMO Capital Markets in
Toronto, said since North American trading hours began, the
dollar has given back some of its gains versus the yen.
 ""We've seen straightforward pressure to be buying yen and
selling dollars, which is exactly the opposite thing that this
concerted effort was targeted to do,"" he said.
 Expectations that Japanese retail and corporate investors
would start bringing money home for rebuilding after the
disaster drove the yen up this week. So did heavy selling by
margin traders who were forced to unwind positions funded with
cheaply borrowed yen as risk aversion spiked.
 Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon in New
York, said intervention activities could continue for weeks,
which could help stabilize the dollar/yen in the 80 to 85
range.
 ""It's evident this is not just a one-day event. The G7 has
made an extended commitment that we think will stretch over a
number of weeks, and we think it will be successful,"" he said.
 TRENDS UNCHANGED?
 Technical analysts noted upside targets around Monday's
peak of 82.45, followed by the 100-day moving average of 82.61
and 83.30, the intraday high from last Friday. Nomura currency
strategists said the 82.70-83.00 range would be an ""ideal
level"" for computer-driven model accounts to buy dollars.
 Giuseppe Manieri, principal of Premium Currency Advisors,
said Friday's closing level will be closely watched. ""If it is
on the higher side of the weekly bar, having hit the lows this
week, it might mean a reversal.
 ""For now on the long-term side nothing has changed, the
trend is still heavily downwards,"" he said. Zurich-based
Premium Currency Advisors has $875 million under management.
 Paresh Upadhyaya, strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch, said it
may require a move toward higher interest rates in the United
States to sustain downward yen momentum.
 ""For intervention to be successful, it needs to be followed
by policy action,"" he said. ""If the Fed starts openly debating
exiting quantitative easing, that would move interest rate
differentials sharply in favor of the dollar against the yen.""
 VOLATILITY FALLS
 As the dollar rebounded, it became cheaper to hedge against
further yen gains. Implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen
options stood at 13.5 percent, down from 21 percent on
Thursday.
 In currency ETF options, traders exchanged more than 16,000
contracts on the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust , or
3.1 times the fund's average daily volume by early afternoon
trading, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
Shares of the fund fell 2.68 percent to $121.86.
 Most of the action was in the March $124 and $125 put
options ahead of the contract's expiration after the close.
 ""So investors are probably closing these positions and
taking some profits off the table after the big move in the
yen,"" said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy.
""Trading is mixed in both puts and calls on the fund as people
try to take positions in anticipation of the next move in the
dollar/yen currency pair.""
 The euro hit a session high around 115.56 yen 
before easing to 114.63, up about 3.6 percent.
 The euro rose to a four-month high against the dollar of
around $1.4184  after the intervention in euro/yen.
 The South Korean  and Chinese 
currencies also jumped against the yen. Those exchange rates
are of particular interest to Tokyo, as excess yen strength
undermines Japanese trade relative to its Asian neighbors.

 Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on
Friday after a Libya ceasefire reduced tension in the region
and the Group of Seven intervened to break the yen's rise,
calming markets.
 World shares as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> advanced0.8 percent, erasing some of the 5.6 percent drop over the
past six trading days and bringing the index back to about

 Oil fell from earlier highs after Libya declared a
ceasefire in the country to protect civilians and comply with
a United Nations resolution passed overnight.
 ""That (Mideast unrest) quieting down and Japan quieting
down will lead to buying,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing
director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
 Brent crude  had surged above $117 a barrel on
worries of escalating unrest in oil-rich countries after the
United Nations approved military action to contain Libya's
Muammar Gaddafi. Brent crude for May delivery slid $1.10, or 1
percent to $113.80 a barrel after the ceasefire. U.S. crude
fell 54 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $100.88.
 The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution endorsing a
no-fly zone for Libya. It authorized ""all necessary measures""

 John McCrank
 OSHAWA, Ontario, March 18 (Reuters) - Canada's Finance
Minister said on Friday it would be up to G7 members to decide
the size of their market intervention to stabilize the Japanese
yen, saying ""we'll have to see"" how successful action has been
so far.
 The Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday
joined earlier efforts by European authorities and the Bank of
Japan after the G7 agreed late Thursday on a joint effort to
reverse recent sharp gains by the yen and calm markets after
Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami and its unfolding
nuclear crisis. [ID:nN18225932]
 ""The central bank governors and the ministers of finance
all agreed that we would act co-operatively to defend the
currency, which was being traded in a disorderly way and was
challenging recovery in Japan,"" Flaherty told reporters.
 ""With respect to the scope of the action, that's for the
participants to determine. We've had some discussions about
that but they'll have to remain matters that are of concern to
the participants, not public.""
 The yen fell on Friday after the G7 nations carried out the
first co-ordinated intervention since 2000, and traders braced
for what could be weeks of official action to drive the
currency lower.
 Flaherty was cautious about assessing the impact of the
steps taken on Friday.
 ""With respect to the success of the intervention. We'll
have to see how things proceed today in the various markets
around the world.""
 The Bank of Canada sold yen to buy Canadian dollars, a
spokesman said, but analysts said Canada's trade was likely
less than $200 million and largely symbolic.
 Canada's yen reserves were just $252 million at the end of
February, of total foreign currency reserves of $60.3 billion,
according to the report issued March 3.
 Intervention during March will be reflected in the
government's foreign reserves report due April 5.

 SANTIAGO, March 18 (Reuters) - Chile's economic growth
slowed in the fourth quarter, the central bank said on Friday,
but analysts see expansion accelerating in early 2011, driven
by higher copper prices and strong domestic demand.
 Chile's gross domestic product  expanded 0.9
percent in the fourth quarter from the third, and 5.8 percent
from the fourth quarter of 2009. For all of 2010, the economy
expanded 5.2 percent, the central bank said.
 ""While activity slowed toward the end of 2010 ... it will
likely show a pick-up during the first quarters of this year,
which we think will drive GDP to grow 6.4 percent (in 2011),
which is well above readings for at least the last decade,""
BICE Inversiones said in a research note.
 Chile's government has forecast the economy will grow by
around 6 percent in 2011.
 ""The country is back on its feet, the economy is back on
its feet and we have created a record number of jobs,"" Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain told reporters on Friday.
 The central bank on Thursday raised its benchmark interest
rate  by a bigger-than-expected 50 basis points and
said more hikes will follow as it prioritizes its fight against
high inflation over a strong currency. [ID:nN17171992]
 The peso  rose 0.9 percent in Friday trade
following the aggressive rate hike. [ID:nN18247328]
 ""The government is following inflation data with interest
and concern over what happens with inflation,"" Larrain said.
 The economy is seen strengthening again in the first
quarter and expanding by 8.1 percent from a year earlier
following a surge in copper export revenues in January and
February as prices rose to record highs, and on robust domestic
demand. [ID:nN07295594]
 The fourth-quarter growth compares with a revised 6.9
percent expansion in the third quarter from a year earlier and
2.1 percent growth in the third quarter versus the second
quarter.
 On Wednesday, the central bank said the economy could
expand over 11 percent in March from a year earlier, when Chile
was battered by a devastating earthquake and ensuing tsunamis
in late February 2010.
 ""GDP was driven by all sectors of economic activity (in
2010), except fishing and industry, which fell mainly because
of the effects of the quake,"" the central bank said.

Chile surprises with aggressive 50 bps hike [ID:nN17171992]

 Chile, whose growth in part is due to a low base of
comparison because of the quake, is diverging from Latin
America's biggest economies, Brazil and Mexico, which are seen
slowing after a tepid expansion in 2010.
 The country is seen continuing to grow solidly, despite a
nuclear crisis in quake-hit Japan, the No. 2 destination for
Chile's exports, which along with unrest in the Middle East is
threatening the global recovery.
 Prospects of strong markets for copper, Chile's main
export, are seen safe because they can be rerouted to other
hungry markets. In addition, Japan's copper demand will likely
soar when the country's rebuilding is under way, the Chilean
government says. [ID:nN17235416]
 A robust economic expansion in the first quarter of 2011
would also give Chile's central bank leeway to act more
aggressively to counter mounting pressures from higher global
oil and food prices. Chile imports nearly all its fuel needs.
 The central bank also revised up the fourth-quarter trade
surplus to $4.4 billion from a previous estimate of $4.2
billion.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - The dollar rose 3 percent
against the yen on Friday after the Group of Seven launched its
first coordinated intervention in currency markets since 2000,
and traders braced for more efforts to prevent runaway yen
gains in the weeks ahead.
 The Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada said they had sold
yen, bolstering European and Japanese efforts to reverse the
currency's recent sharp gains and calm markets after Japan's
devastating earthquake and tsunami and an unfolding nuclear
disaster sparked a week of near panic in world markets.
 The dollar rose as high as 82.00 yen early in European
trade before easing to 81.10 in New York, up about 3 percent.
The yen's plunge to a a record low near 76 yen earlier this
week had pushed the G7 into action.
 Hedge funds and other speculative accounts tested official
resolve by buying into the yen sell-off, but analysts said
authorities were set to fight any attempt to push it back up.
 ""It's evident this is not just a one-day event. The G7 has
made an extended commitment that we think will stretch over a
number of weeks, and we think it will be successful,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 ""They've put a floor under dollar/yen at 80 and they will
be happy to stabilize it between 80 and 85,"" he said.
 Tokyo market estimates had the Bank of Japan selling some 2
trillion yen ($25 billion) over the course of the day, similar
to its a one-day bout of intervention in September.
 Nomura Securities, which called the G7 move ""a
once-in-a-decade event,"" estimated the European Central Bank
intervened to the tune of about 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion).
Markets remained on alert for more Fed and Bank of Canada
action.
 The euro hit a session high around 115.56 yen before easing
to 114.63, up about 3.6 percent.
 As the dollar rebounded, it became cheaper to hedge against
further yen gains. Implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen
options stood at 13.5 percent, from 21 percent on Thursday.
 The euro rose to a four-month high against the dollar of
around $1.4145 after the intervention in euro/yen.
 The South Korean and Chinese currencies also jumped against
the yen. Those exchange rates are of particular interest to
Tokyo, as excess yen strength undermines Japanese trade
relative to its Asian neighbors.
 CALMING THE WATERS
 The first G7 joint intervention in a decade capped a
frantic week for Japanese markets that saw the Nikkei suffer
its worst two-day rout since the 1987 crash and the yen soaring
as investors watched the country's nuclear crisis escalate.
 Expectations that Japanese retail and corporate investors
would start bringing money home for rebuilding after a massive
earthquake and tsunami drove the yen up this week.
 So did heavy selling by margin traders who were forced to
unwind positions funded with cheaply borrowed yen as the
currency rose to a record high against the dollar.
 Analysts said central bank determination would help counter
those flows. Upside targets were seen around Monday's peak of
82.45, followed by the 100-day moving average of 82.61 and
83.30, the intraday high from last Friday. Nomura currency
strategists said the 82.70-83.00 range would be an ""ideal
level"" for computer-driven model accounts to buy dollars.
 ""I would expect strong defense of 80 yen,"" said David Mann,
head of research at Standard Chartered in New York, adding any
move lower would prompt authorities to redouble yen selling.
 LIMITS TO INTERVENTION
 Paresh Upadhyaya, strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch, said it
may take a move toward higher interest rates in the United
States to sustain downward yen momentum.
 ""For intervention to be successful, it needs to be followed
by policy action,"" he said. ""If the Fed starts openly debating
exiting quantitative easing, that would move interest rate
differentials sharply in favor of the dollar against the yen.""
 The Fed said this week that higher commodity prices were
putting upward but temporary pressure on inflation, and it
reiterated its pledge to keep interest rates -- currently near
zero -- at very low levels for an extended period.
 But Mann said investors may want to temper expectations
when it comes to upside targets for the dollar and other
currencies against the yen.
 ""With each intervention, you end up seeing a diminishing
marginal return,"" he said. ""The first time usually has the
biggest impact. The next round is less of a shock. It'll become
increasingly difficult for intervention to be successful.""
 What's more, he said central banks have yet to sell yen
simultaneously as they did when they supported the euro in
2000, which tends to have the biggest impact.
 Coordinated intervention this time around ""looks to us more
symbolic than anything else,"" he said.

 * Govt to continue reforms despite deep fall in popularity
 * PM says belt-tightening reforms should not impact growth
 * Says pact for euro ""a mistake"", Czechs won't join
By Michael Winfrey and Jana Mlcochova
 PRAGUE, March 18 (Reuters) - The centre-right Czech
government will cut its 2011 budget deficit more than planned
and will push on with tough belt-tightening measures despite a
fall in popularity, Prime Minister Petr Necas said on Friday.
 The austerity minded leader of the right-of-centre Civic
Democrats said the government would try to cut the deficit to at
least 4.4 percent of GDP, better than its 4.6 percent target.
 The government's zeal for belt-tightening often puts it on
the same side as euro zone heavyweight Germany, but Necas said
the Czechs would not follow the Berlin-backed ""Pact for the
Euro"" at a March 24 European Union summit.
 He added the decision to approve the pact without inviting
non-euro zone states to the table had been a mistake. The pact
calls for fiscal stabilising measures.
 ""We do not count on participating in this pact at the
moment. One reason is that we were not invited to the
negotiations on March 11,"" he said from the government office,
overlooking the Vltava river and Prague's Charles Bridge.
 ""Historically, the Czechs are suspicious when there are
talks 'about us, without us',"" he added, invoking a phrase often
used to refer to Germany's annexation of former Czechoslovakia
in 1939, an act bitterly resented by Czechs who felt betrayed
when Britain and France refused to step in.
 Necas said the country of 10.5 million would pursue parts of
the pact -- including enshrining a public debt ceiling in law
and reforming the pension system -- on its own.

For a Take A Look on Czech pension reforms: [ID:nLDE71R1QG]
For highlights of the interview: [ID:nLDE72H1FM]
===============================================================>
 But his government disagreed with other elements of the
agreement such as the harmonisation of corporate taxes, and was
affronted by the fact that the Czechs had been invited to join
only after it had been hammered out by euro zone countries.
 ""I consider it a mistake to exclude part of the member
countries from decision-making on things that will impact all of
them,"" he said. 
 
 FIRM ON AUSTERITY
 Necas took the reins of the scandal-plagued Civic Democrats
after the last government it led collapsed during the Czechs'
stint at the rotating EU presidency in 2009, an embarrassing
blow to a country wary of deeper integration with the bloc.
 Known as ""Mr. Clean"" for his public image of high moral
standards and an absence of scandals, the tall, friendly father
of four is seen as less divisive than previous party leaders
Mirek Topolanek and eurosceptic President Vaclav Klaus.
 He has pledged to lead a ""government of budget
responsibility"" that has slashed its public spending deficit
from 5.8 percent of GDP at the height of the crisis in 2009 to
4.8 percent last year.
 That result was better than the government's target of 5.3
percent, and Necas said it would try to repeat that this year.
 ""It is one of our fundamental tasks to be better than our
original target so it is the reason why we would like to be
under 4.4 percent of GDP,"" he said.
 The government's reforms include a 10 percent cut to the
total public sector wage bill that has angered police, firemen,
and government clerks, as well as pushing for a new private
savings element to augment the state pay-as-you-go pension plan
that has also led to tax hikes to finance it.
 The moves have hit his government's popularity. While 64
percent of Czechs supported his cabinet after an election last
May, that fell to 30 percent in February, a poll showed. Necas
said he was not concerned and would continue with the reforms.
 ""It is the political price that I was ready for and it does
not surprise me,"" Necas said. ""In fact, popularity is a
secondary question for me now, with no election coming up.""
 He said that because the Czech economy was mainly driven by
exports, rather than domestic demand, he did not think the
reforms would hit growth, despite the central bank's warning
that it was suppressing domestic demand.
 He added that the government had decided not to pursue an
earlier idea of financing pension reform with revenues from
selling state-owned assets.
 ""In many countries around us, governments have diverted part
of the money to private funds without worrying how to cover the
gap,"" Necas said. ""Today they are getting in to huge problems,
in Hungary, Poland, and also in Slovakia. We are not going this
way. We have been responsible from the very beginning.""

157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2011 10:37AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-S.Africa govt, c.bank back off from weakening rand"," * Strong rand has helped contain inflation
 * Signs of slight shift in govt thinking on rand
 * Weaker rand wouldn't help economy much
 
 By Phumza Macanda
 JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Reuters) - South Africa's government,
which has repeatedly bemoaned the strength of the rand, is
probably hoping the currency won't extend this week's
Japan-related slide as this would stoke inflation at a time of
sluggish growth.
 In recent years the ANC government has been under pressure
to weaken the rand from its trade union allies, who blamed
pressure from a strong currency for leaving almost half of the
adult population without jobs.
 The government has voiced its concern at the rise and taken
some limited action to try to weaken the unit, but unlike other
emerging markets such as Brazil, South Africa rejected the idea
of taxing capital inflows last year, which were the main driver
of rand gains.
 Analysts say the government wouldn't like to see a dramatic
weakening of the rand in a short space of time.
 ""Would authorities over time prefer a rand that is weaker?
Yes,"" said Jeff Gable, head of research at Absa Capital.
 ""Would they like it to get weaker right away? Probably not,
because in the current environment that would generate just as
many problems as it might be seen to solve.""
 The rand has gained about 26 percent since the beginning of
2009 -- and performed better than emerging peers Brazil and
Turkey so far this year -- but it slid nearly 7 percent this
week as markets panicked that a series of natural disasters in
Japan would hamper global growth.
 There were also signs that Japanese funds and retail
investors could repatriate cash held up in foreign exchange
denominated bonds, including rand.
 Despite a rebound following G7 action to steady the yen,
analysts see further weakness for the South African currency in
the longer term as foreign capital inflows taper off. More
capital could leave the country when the developed world starts
raising interest rates.

 DILEMMA
 Rand strength has been positive for inflation though.
Inflation has been within the central bank's 3-6 percent target
since February 2010.
 The bank is expecting it to remain in that band until the
end of 2012 but is widely expected to raise its forecasts at a
Monetary Policy Committee meeting next week in light of higher
global oil and food prices.
 The favourable inflation environment gave the Reserve Bank
room to slash its repo rate by 650 basis points to 5.5 percent,
in an effort to stimulate the economy.
 Manufacturing in Africa's biggest economy was hardest hit by
a 2009 recession and is yet to recover fully. Industry is
blaming the rand for its woes.
 In an effort to weaken the rand, or at least arrest its
gains, the government last year stepped up foreign exchange
reserves accumulation and relaxed exchange controls.
 But inflation is slowly picking up. Central bank (SARB)
Governor Gill Marcus said last week the bank was worried about
the impact of global oil and food prices on inflation.
 Should inflation rise, it would stoke protests among the
millions of unemployed and low-earners who spend a big chunk of
their income on food and transport.
 Unions, including COSATU which is the largest labour
federation in the country, would demand above-inflation wage
increases and resort to strikes that often characterise the
wage-negotiation season.
 Relations between the ANC and its allies are already tense
and the ANC alliance can ill-afford further strains.
 Policymakers are in a quandary about how to strike a balance
between achieving a competitive currency that supports growth
without pushing up inflation.
 Last year all policymakers were in agreement the rand was
""overvalued"" but there seems to have been a subtle shift.
 Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan refrained from announcing
new measures to weaken the rand in his budget last month and
last week said the ""strongish"" rand was helping curb inflation.
 ""Rand weakness has perhaps moved down the pecking order in
government's list of priorities,"" said Peter Attard Montalto,
emerging market strategist at Nomura in London.
 ""There is also a growing view we are sensing out there that
the SARB would rather have a stronger currency than increase
rates.""
 ""Whilst this is an exaggeration, we do think (SARB governor)
Marcus is of the camp on the MPC who wants rate stability into
next year. The issue is about timing and speed of rand
strength.""
 Besides, even if the rand were to weaken dramatically, it is
unlikely to solve South Africa's competitiveness problems.
 About a third of exports go to the United States, Japan,
Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. Although China is
the biggest bilateral trading partner, only 11 percent of South
Africa's exports go to the fast-growing economy.
 ""The argument for a weaker rand just doesn't stack up. We do
better when the G7 countries do better. Our economic performance
is not linked to rand weakness,"" said Adrian Saville, chief
investment officer at Cannon Asset Managers.

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Koh Gui Qing and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, March 18 (Reuters) - China raised banks' required
reserves again in a decision on Friday, the latest installment
in its monetary tightening cycle that many had thought would be
put on hold after Japan's devastating earthquake.
 Its persistance with a campaign to rein in prices that has
cooled hopes for the scale of world growth showed that the
People's Bank of China views inflation, not an economic slowdown
resulting from Japan's disaster, as the bigger risk.
 China's announcement came just hours after the Group of
Seven rich nations said they would jointly intervene to calm
markets unnerved by Japan's nuclear crisis and to rein in the
rising yen.
 The 50-basis-point increase in required reserves was the
third this year and lifts the mandatory ratio for the country's
biggest banks to a record 20.0 percent.
 The increase in reserves will lock up about 350 billion yuan
($53 billion) of cash that banks would otherwise have been able
to lend in the world's second largest economy, making it an
important tool for slowing money growth and dampening inflation.
 ""It's clear evidence that tightening is still on,"" said
Stephen Green, an economist with Standard Chartered in Shanghai.
 ""An interest rate rise in these circumstances (following the
earthquake) is difficult, but it looks like they're dealing with
liquidity again,"" he said.
 While markets have long expected more tightening by China,
the timing of the move was surprising after several prominent
economists predicted this week that the central bank would wait
to gauge the impact of Japan's earthquake and tsunami.
 Japan bought billions of dollars in the market on Friday
followed by other central banks, kicking off a rare round of
concerted intervention by the G7 nations seeking to moderate the
impact on markets of Japan's nuclear disaster.
 A source told Reuters Japan would leave the yen it sold
during intervention in the banking system rather than mopping it
up, adding to the ample liquidity in the system -- which could
run the risk of boosting inflation.
 Juxtaposed against that, China's decision to mop up more
funds gave a clear idea of the central bank's priorities.
 ""This move ... is another sign that the tragic events in
Japan are unlikely to have a significant impact on policy
decisions elsewhere in Asia,"" said Brian Jackson, economist with
Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 ""This decision clearly indicates that curbing price
pressures is the key economic priority for Beijing right now.""
 European stocks and copper prices dipped after the reserve
ratio increase, but market reaction was otherwise muted with
many risky assets holding steady.
 
 FOCUS ON INFLATION
 Chinese consumer price inflation was unchanged from January
at 4.9 percent in February and it is likely to tick up in the
coming months because of a lower base of comparison.
 China's top leaders have declared that their most important
task this year is to control inflation. So far, complaints about
rising prices have amounted to little more than grumbles, but
serious inflation has sparked social unrest in China in the
past.
 To meet the official goal of keeping inflation to a 4
percent average this year, the government has raised interest
rates three times and banks' reserve requirements six times
since October, while also using a series of direct controls to
cap price rises.
 There are signs that the government has started to make
progress. The central bank on Monday reported sharply lower bank
lending growth last month, which will help reduce inflationary
pressure.
 ""Companies are finding it difficult to get money from the
banks. So I think there is a very aggressive monetary policy
tightening in China. That's the main story, so inflation should
start to come down,"" said Paul Cavey, economist with Macquarie
Securities in Hong Kong.
 In a short statement posted on its website, the People's
Bank of China said the increase will be effective March 25.
 
 FIGHTING INFLOWS
 The required reserve increase announced on Friday was also
seen as surprising against a background of apparently weaker
capital inflows. Excess cash stemming from China's vast trade
surplus has been a root cause of the country's run-up in prices,
but it had a combined trade deficit of $890 million in the first
two months of the year.
 What's more, aggressive open market operations by the
central bank had led people to believe that it could afford to
delay its next does of tightening.
 ""It is a fairly surprising move as the central bank has been
quite successful in issuing central bank bills in the last
couple of days,"" said Xu Biao, an economist with China Merchants
Bank in Shenzhen.
 ""The liquidity stemming from foreign exchange inflows in
February may be stronger than expected and the central bank has
to move more aggressively to soak up liquidity,"" he said.
 Along with external sources of liquidity, there is about 750
billion yuan in central bank bills that are set to mature by the
end of April, putting extra pressure on the central bank to
drain excess cash from the economy.
 It has conducted net drains in its open market operations
for the past two weeks, reviving them as it looks to use all
tools at its disposal to dampen inflationary pressure.
 But as the latest small step in a succession of tightening
moves over the past half year, the required reserve increase
will be taken in stride by domestic investors, said Qian Qimin,
analyst with Shenyin and Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
 ""The market has got used to required reserve ratio hikes,
and there should be no big impact on share prices,"" he said.

tonnes,"" First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov told a
teleconference of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin with regional
governors.
 Russian grain traders hope to return to export markets later
this year. The government has imposed a grain export ban up to
July 1, following a devasting drought that wiped out one third
of the crop last summer.
 Domestic grain consumption is about 72-74 million tonnes per
year, and industry analysts say Russia could return to the
export market if the harvest reaches 85 million tonnes.
 SovEcon analysts said earlier this week the crop could range
between 75-85 million tonnes this year.

(Updates throughout with analysts, background)
 By Shrikesh Laxmidas and Axel Bugge
 LISBON, March 18 (Reuters) - Political tensions rose in
debt-laden Portugal on Friday as the prime minister accused the
opposition of trying to topple his minority government by
threatening to block austerity measures aimed at avoiding a
bailout.
 The row between the government and the main Social Democrat
opposition (PSD), which could result in a snap election, came as
the country struggles to convince investors and Brussels that it
can get its public finances in order and avoid the fate of
Greece and Ireland.
""The only thing that is clear is that the PSD wants ... to
open a political crisis and put the blame on those who are ready
to negotiate,"" Socrates told parliament, referring to austerity
measures presented last week.
 Portugal remains under pressure to seek relief in a bailout
as its bond yields are trading near euro-era highs.
 President Anibal Cavaco Silva is attempting to mediate a
way out of the crisis and will meet Socrates later on Friday
after talking with PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho on Thursday.
 ""This is a situation with great uncertainty,"" said Antonio
Costa Pinto, a political analyst at Lisbon University. ""But one
thing is certain -- the chances of a wide-reaching for more
austerity measures has diminished.""
 That could make the job of meeting tough budget goals to
calm investors much harder. 
 So far in the euro debt crisis, the minority government has
relied on the PSD to pass austerity bills as it lacks a majority
in parliament.
 But on Friday the two sides traded accusations, with PSD
bench leader Miguel Macedo telling parliament it was the
government, and not his party, that was paving the way for a
crisis.
 ""This package contains measures which the PSD explicitly
refused in prior negotiations. You (Socrates) have closed the
door to any consensus and opened the door to a political
crisis,"" Macedo said.
 Socrates said earlier this week that if the latest measures
are not passed he may resign, even though it is not yet clear
when they will be presented to parliament.
 
 DAMAGING ADVENTURE?
 ""Those who refuse to negotiate ... convinced that this is
the moment to bring the government down, will pay the price for
driving the country into a damaging adventure,"" he told
parliament on Friday.
 Socrates said he was still available to negotiate proposals
for the 2011-2013 economic plan with the opposition.
 ""From what the government has said, it wants to remove from
itself the blame of a request for aid,"" said Jornal de Negocios
in an editorial.
 A Reuters poll of 45 economists this week pointed to a 60
percent chance that Portugal will need a bailout like Greece and
Ireland, with the expectation that it will happen by June.
 The government hopes a wider European Union deal to beef up
the euro's rescue fund can help it avoid a bailout.
 Lisbon has consistently refused to consider a bailout, which
Socrates says would be humiliating for Portugal. It hopes to
regain the confidence of the markets by showing it can reduce
the budget deficit quickly.
 The government said late on Thursday that the core state
sector deficit for the first two months of the year slumped 69
percent to 349 million euros ($489 million) as tax hikes and
spending cuts kicked in.
 The latest measures include cutting pensions and health
spending and freezing infrastructure work to help Portugal cut
its budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product this
year after it beat its 2010 target of 7.3 percent.
 But social pressures are rising on the government, with a
second, large protest rally against austerity planned for
Saturday.
 The country also saw its credit rating cut by two notches
this week by Moody's.
 But Portugal's bond prices rose on Friday in market action
that traders said was due to buying by the European Central
Bank. The Portuguese/German 10-year government bond yield spread
fell to 448 basis points on Friday versus 460 bps at Thursday's
settlement.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The yen fell broadly on Friday
as European authorities sold the Japanese currency in the first
co-ordinated Group of Seven intervention since 2000, but traders
said impact in European time appeared to be limited.
 Traders braced for more possible yen selling when the North
American session begins, with the Federal Reserve and the Bank
of Canada also widely expected to play their part in the
yen-selling effort.
 The dollar rose as high as 82.00 yen early in the European
session. Speculators such as hedge funds tested the authorities'
resolve by buying into the yen's sell-off, but talk of official
bids around 81.20 yen limited further gains in the Japanese
currency.
 Market participants still anticipate repatriation flows into
Japan after last week's earthquake and the subsequent nuclear
crisis will support the yen, but analysts suspect Tokyo will
defend the dollar until the country's financial year ends on
March 31.
 ""It will be interesting to see whether any speculators will
be brave enough to try and push the dollar down through 80 yen
again,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB.
 ""If they are, I'm sure the BOJ will ... quickly move it back
up to 82 yen. It will be a losing game for anyone who tries to
bet against them.""
 
 CO-ORDINATED EFFORT
 All of the major G7 European central banks confirmed they
had joined in the move, pushing the euro to a session high of
115.56 from around 114.70. The Federal Reserve was expected to
jump in when U.S. markets open around 1200 GMT.
 By 1124 GMT, the dollar traded roughly 3.5 percent higher on
the day at 81.45 yen, with traders reporting heavy dollar offers
at 82.00 yen.
 The U.S. currency extended its gains only marginally in the
European session, but it has extended its rebound from a record
low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday.
 The euro traded 4 percent higher at 115.00 yen.
 Tokyo market estimates put the BOJ's earlier intervention at
2 trillion yen ($25 billion) over the course of the day, similar
to its big one-day bout of intervention in September.
 Many in the market said the amount spent in the European
session was significantly lower.
 ""They simply must do more (if they want to have a bigger
impact,"" said a trader in London. ""Maybe everyone's waiting for
the Fed.""
 The G7 has long warned against excessive volatility in
exchange rates. But many traders were expected to need to unload
dollars at higher levels and slow any advance, especially after
Thursday's shocking plunge in dollar/yen that saw it collapse
more than 4 percent in just an hour. 
 Upside targets were 5at 82.45, Monday's peak, and then 83.30
-- the intraday high from last Friday before this week's
fireworks.
 ""The intervention needs to be concerted and
aggressive....and even then I'm sceptical,"" said another trader
in London.
 BTM UFJ analysts said they expected all G7 countries to
intervene in sell the yen on Friday, but expected the BoJ to do
much of the heavy lifting.
 ""Actions taken by central banks outside of Japan today will
involve token amounts given the action taken in Tokyo appears to
have been aggressive,"" they said in a note.
 
 FRANTIC 
 The first G7 joint intervention in a decade capped a frantic
week for Japanese markets that saw the Nikkei suffer its worst
two-day rout since the 1987 crash and the yen soaring as
investors watched the country's nuclear crisis escalate.
 As the dollar rebounded, the cost of hedging against a
further yen rise fell. Implied volatility on one-month
dollar/yen options was at around 13.5 percent, well off highs
near 21 percent on Thursday and showing the market calming a
bit.
 The euro rose to a four-month high against the dollar of
around $1.4135 after the intervention in euro/yen, up around 0.8
percent on the day.
 The Australian dollar was up 1 percent at $0.9917, barely
moving after China's central bank raised level of its banks'
reserve requirements on Friday.

 By Shinichi Saoshiro and Yoko Nishikawa	
 TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japanese engineers conceded on
Friday that burying a crippled nuclear plant in sand and
concrete may be a last resort to prevent a catastrophic
radiation release, the method used to seal huge leakages from
Chernobyl in 1986.	
 But they still hoped to solve the crisis by fixing a power
cable to two reactors by Saturday to restart water pumps needed
to cool overheating nuclear fuel rods. Workers also sprayed
water on the No.3 reactor, the most critical of the plant's six.	
 It was the first time the facility operator had acknowledged
burying the sprawling 40-year-old complex was possible, a sign
that piecemeal actions such as dumping water from military
helicopters or scrambling to restart cooling pumps may not work.	
 ""It is not impossible to encase the reactors in concrete.
But our priority right now is to try and cool them down first,""
an official from the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co,
told a news conference.	
 As Japan entered its second week after a 9.0-magnitude
earthquake and 10-metre (33-foot) tsunami flattened coastal
cities and killed thousands, the world's worst nuclear crisis
since Chernobyl and Japan's worst humanitarian crisis since
World War Two looked far from over. 
 Around 6,500 people have been confirmed dead from the
earthquake and tsunami while 10,300 are missing, many feared
dead. 
 Some 390,000 people including many elderly are homeless and
battling near-freezing temperatures in makeshift shelters in
northeast coastal areas. Food, water, medicine and heating fuel
is in short supply.	
 The government signalled it could have moved faster in
dealing with the multiple disasters.	
 ""An unprecedented huge earthquake and huge tsunami hit
Japan. As a result, things that had not been anticipated in
terms of the general disaster response took place,"" Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told a news conference.	
 Japan also raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis
from Level 4 to Level 5 on the seven-level INES international
scale, putting it on a par with America's Three Mile Island
accident in 1979, although some experts say it is more serious. 
 Chernobyl was a 7 on the INES scale.	
 
 Tourists, expatriates and many Japanese continue to leave
Tokyo, fearing a blast of radioactive material from the nuclear
complex 240 km (150 miles) to the north, even though health
officials and the U.N. atomic watchdog have said radiation
levels in the capital were not harmful.	
 That is little solace for about 300 nuclear plant workers
toiling in the radioactive wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and
protective suits with seams sealed off by duct tape to keep out
radioactive particles. 
 ""My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are
doing,"" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan's Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. 
 Even if engineers restore power at the Fukushima Daiichi
plant, the pumps may be too damaged from the earthquake, tsunami
or subsequent explosions to work.	
 The first step is to restore power to pumps for reactors No.
1 and 2, and possibly 4, by Saturday, said Hidehiko Nishiyama,
Japan's nuclear safety agency spokesman.	
 By Sunday, the government expects to connect electricity to
pumps for its badly damaged reactor No.3 -- a focal point in the
crisis because of its use of mixed oxides, or mox, containing
both uranium and highly toxic plutonium.	
 Asked about burying the reactors in sand and concrete,
Nishiyama said: ""That solution is in the back of our minds, but
we are focused on cooling the reactors down.""	
 Burying the reactors would leave part of Japan off-limits
for decades. ""It's just not that easy,"" Murray Jennex, a San
Diego State University in California professor said when asked
about the so-called Chernobyl option to bury the reactors.	
 ""They are kind of like a coffee maker. If you leave it on
the heat, they boil dry and then they crack,"" he said. ""Putting
concrete on that wouldn't help keep your coffee maker safe. But
eventually, yes, you could build a concrete shield and be done
with it.""	
 
 DOLLAR GAINS AS FINANCIAL LEADERS INTERVENE	
 The Group of Seven rich nations, stepping in together to
calm global financial markets after a tumultuous week, agreed to
join in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen.	
 The U.S. dollar surged more than two yen to 81.80
after the G7's pledge to intervene, leaving behind a record low
of 76.25 hit on Thursday. 
 Japan's Nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent,
recouping some of the week's stinging losses. It has lost 10.2
percent this week, wiping $350 billion off market
capitalisation.	
 U.S. markets, which had tanked earlier in the week on the
back of the crisis, rebounded on Thursday but investors were not
convinced the advance would last. 
 The yen has seen steady buying since the earthquake as
Japanese and international investors closed long positions in
higher-yielding, riskier assets such as the Australian dollar,
funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency.	
 Expectations that Japanese insurers and companies would
repatriate billions of dollars in overseas funds to pay for a
reconstruction bill that is expected to be much costlier than
the one that followed the Kobe earthquake in 1995 also have
helped boost the yen.

 MANY STILL WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WATER, POWER 
 The plight of those left homeless by the earthquake and
tsunami worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow
to worst-affected areas.	
 Supplies of water, heating oil and fuel are low at
evacuation centres, where many survivors wait bundled in
blankets. Many elderly lack proper medical supplies. Food is
often rationed. Rescue workers report acute fuel shortages.	
 The government said on Friday it was considering moving some
evacuees to parts of the country unscathed by the devastation.	
 Nearly 320,000 households in the north were still without
electricity in near-freezing weather as of Friday afternoon,
officials said, and the government said at least 1.6 million
households lacked running water. 
 The government has told everyone living within 20 km (12
miles) of the crippled plant to evacuate, and advised people
within 30 km (18 miles) to stay indoors.	
 The U.S. embassy in Tokyo has urged citizens living within
80 km (50 miles) of the plant to evacuate or remain indoors ""as
a precaution"", while Britain's foreign office urged citizens ""to
consider leaving the area"". Other nations have urged nationals
in Japan to leave the country or head south.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose and the yen
tumbled on Friday after the Group of Seven intervened to weaken
the currency and calm markets worried about Japan's nuclear
crisis, but doubts over the scope of the move blunted its
impact.
 European equities pared earlier gains after China's central
bank raised lenders' required reserve ratios in a move which
also briefly reversed a rally in Brent crude prices.
 Brent was last up less than $2 back just above $116 a barrel
on worries of escalating unrest in oil-rich Middle East and
North Africa after the U.N. approved military action to contain
Libya's Muammar Gaddafi.
 The show of solidarity by the G7 major developed economies
to support Japan through its biggest crisis since World War Two
comes a day after the yen soared to a record 76.25 per dollar in
chaotic trading. It is the first coordinated currency
intervention by the G7 in a decade.
 ""The G7 intervention is calming the markets, but we still
need a few days of consolidation to think we are over the worst
of it,"" Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index in London,
said.
 ""It is just helping sentiment, and stocks sensitive to risk
will push on. But optimism is going to be guarded as there are
no firm resolutions surrounding the Japanese nuclear crisis and
the Middle East, and anything can happen on the weekend.""
 The dollar was last up just over 3 percent at 81.40 yen,
retreating from a session high of around 81.98 yen, following
the G7 announcement, which came just as the Tokyo stock market
opened. 
 The euro was last up 3.9 percent at 115.06 yen, having
jumped to a session high of 115.50 yen earlier from around
114.70, with some traders saying the scale of intervention was
so far a fairly tame effort to stem the yen's surge.
 Some market observers said even massive official selling
might not restrain the yen for long, pointing to the Japan's
last intervention in September 2010 when it sold a huge 2.1
trillion yen, or around $25 billion worth, but only managed to
push the dollar up from 82.85 to 85.77 yen.
 ""It would need to be concerted and aggressive....and even
then I'm sceptical,"" said Richard Wiltshire, a currency trader
at ETX Capital in London. 
 Some market observers said the market was now focusing on
the possibility of the Federal Reserve joining in when U.S.
markets open around 1200 GMT.
 
 MIDDLE EAST WEIGHS
 Japan's Nikkei share index climbed 2.7 percent, recouping
some of the week's stinging losses as Japan reeled from an
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant crisis.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were last up 0.3 percent,
with the upward trend curbed by heightening geopolitical tension
in the Middle East.
 German government bonds gained, driving yields lower with
investors wary about going into the weekend short of safe-haven
assets given escalating geopolitical tension in the Middle East
as well as the events in Japan.
 Brent was less than $4 away from a 2-1/2-year high of almost
$120 reached on Feb. 24, when an uprising against Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi shut down at least two-thirds of Libya's oil
output.
 The U.N. Security Council, meeting in emergency session on
Thursday, passed a resolution endorsing a no-fly zone to halt
government troops now around 100 km (60 miles) from Benghazi. 
 It also authorised ""all necessary measures"" -- code for
military action -- to protect civilians against Gaddafi's
forces.
 Spot gold rose by as much as $12.69 to $1,415.09 but was
still off a record around $1,444 hit last week on high oil
prices, fears about civil war in Libya, unrest in the Middle
East and renewed worries about sovereign debt crisis in Europe.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Yuko Yoshikawa	
 March 18 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven is ready to ""act
decisively"" again if currency market speculation persists,
Japanese deputy finance minister Fumihiko Igarashi said on
Friday after the G7 agreed to intervene together to restrain the
soaring yen.	
 Igarashi told Reuters in an interview he was satisfied with
the impact the rare joint action had on Japanese markets,
helping boost stocks and weakening the yen.	
 The G7 show of solidarity came as a surprise to many because
Tokyo had indicated it was looking for moral support for its
attempts to calm markets rather than concerted intervention.	
 ""The yen's rise was driven by speculators,"" Igarashi, one of
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda's two deputies, said.	
 ""G7 countries agreed that if we caved in to such speculators
that took advantage of people's misfortunes, the Japanese
economy would be ruined and the whole world economy would be
harmed,"" he said. 
 ""Our stance remains unchanged that we will take decisive
steps against speculators who act like sneaky thieves at a scene
of a fire."" 
 G7 agreed that authorities should in principle stay away
from markets but that Japan was in a state of emergency,
struggling to cope with a triple blow of a deadly earthquake,
tsunami and the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.	
 The U.S. dollar surged two full yen to as much as 81.83 yen
, leaving behind a record low of 76.25 hit earlier this
week as the Bank of Japan kicked off the joint action. Media
reported it bought more than $25 billion. 
 Asked about the size of Friday's intervention, Igarashi said
he simply was not sure what was the total amount.Japan's Nikkei
share index climbed nearly 3 percent, recouping some of
the week's stinging losses in the aftermath of last week's 9.0
magnitude earthquake.	
 As he was speaking, traders were reporting that European
central bank sprung into action, with French and German central
banks officially confirming they took part in the intervention.	
 Igarashi said the finance ministry expected the Bank of
Japan to continue supplying ample funds to financial
institutions to maximise the impact of the intervention.	
""We think it is desirable for the BOJ to steadily carry it
out (ample fund injections) and we highly value the fact that
the bank has been doing so.""	
 Igarashi said much credit for the swift and rare G7 action
went to Noda and his good relations with U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner, and that it was not certain before Friday's G7
conference call that it would lead to a joint intervention. 
 ""It was not clear if the statement would turn out this
clearcut (on joint action). Noda took strong initiative in
seeking a clear stance on this and persuaded other countries to
agree.""	
 The last time the G7 agreed on joint intervention was a
decade ago to turn a slumping euro following its 1999 launch.	
 The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
United Kingdom and United States.

 LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The yen fell broadly on Friday
as European authorities sold the Japanese currency in the first
co-ordinated Group of Seven intervention since 2000, but traders
said impact in European time appeared to be limited.
 Speculators such as hedge funds were keen to test the
authorities' resolve by buying into the yen's sell-off, with the
market still anticipating repatriation flows into Japan
following last week's earthquake and subsequent nuclear crisis
to support the Japanese currency.
Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan agreed
with central banks of the United States, Britain and Canada as
well as the European Central Bank to jointly intervene in the
currency market.
 The Bank of France and the Bank of England confirmed they
had been selling yen. The Bundesbank said they would participate
but did not say whether they had acted. All of which pushed the
euro to a session high of 115.56 from around 114.70.
 The dollar was only able to extend its gains marginally to
82 yen after jumping nearly 4 percent on the day to as high as
81.90 yen in Asian time on trading platform EBS, extending a
rebound from a record low of 76.25 yen plumbed on Thursday.
 Tokyo market estimates put the BOJ's earlier intervention at
2 trillion yen ($25 billion) over the course of the day, similar
to its big one-day bout of intervention in September.
 Traders widely expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to
intervene when U.S. markets open from 1200 GMT.
 Traders reported heavy dollar offers at 82.00, helping to
push it back down to 81.34. The euro soon slipped back to
114.26, up around 3.3 percent from closing New York levels.
 ""European central banks have been intervening but it's not
going well,"" said a London-based sales trader.
 The G7 has long warned against excessive volatility in
exchange rates. But many traders were expected to need to unload
dollars at higher levels and slow any advance, especially after
Thursday's shocking plunge in dollar/yen that saw it collapse
more than 4 percent in just an hour. 
 Upside targets were at 82.45, Monday's peak, and then 83.30
-- the intraday high from last Friday before this week's
fireworks.
 ""The intervention needs to be concerted and
aggressive....and even then I'm sceptical,"" said another trader
in London.
 The first G7 joint intervention in a decade capped a
frantic week for Japanese markets that saw the Nikkei suffer its
worst two-day rout since the 1987 crash and the yen soaring as
investors watched the country's nuclear crisis escalate.
On Thursday, dollar/yen's break of the 1995 record low of
79.75 triggered a cascade of automatic sell orders, some tied to
leveraged positions and structured FX derivatives, in thin trade
between the U.S. and Asian trading days.
 
 TELLING HISTORY 
 While traders were sceptical any intervention would be
effective, Citibank analysts said the history of G7 action
suggested it could reverse the yen's uptrend in the long run.
 ""The last time G7 conducted a joint intervention was in
September 2000 when the G7 economies put a floor under the euro.
And one month later EUR/USD bottomed out and then turned into
the long term upward trend which continued until 2008,"" said
analysts at CitiFX in a note.
 ""In terms of yen, the typical example of joint intervention
is the Washington G7 in 1995. At the time USDJPY ended its long
years downward trend and turned into an uptrend,"" they added.
 Some others warned, however, that the likelihood that U.S.
interest rates were set to stay low well into the future could
hamper any upswing for the dollar.
 As the dollar rebounded, the cost of hedging against a
further yen rise fell. Implied volatility on one-month
dollar/yen options was at 14 percent, well off highs near 21
percent on Thursday and showing the market calming a bit.
 The euro rose to a four-month high against the dollar of
around $1.4093 after the intervention in euro/yen. It was last
at $1.4053, up around 0.2 percent on the day.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Antoni Slodkowski
 TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japanese shares jumped nearly 3
percent and the yen tumbled on Friday after the Group of Seven
agreed on joint intervention to curb the soaring currency and
calm markets jittery over Japan's nuclear power plant crisis.
 European stocks looked set to join in the rally, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 rising half a percent at the open. Traders were
also citing initial intervention in the euro to bolster the yen.
 Brent crude oil jumped by $2 to close to $117 a barrel
fears of rising geopolitical tension in the oil-rich Middle East
and North Africa, after the United Nations approved military
action to contain Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
The move by the G7 to support Japan as it struggles to cope
with its biggest crisis since World War Two comes a day after
the yen soared to a record 76.25 in chaotic trading.
 The dollar rose more than 3 percent to around 81.75 yen
after the G7 announcement, which came just as the Tokyo stock
market opened.
 ""It was as clear as it could be and it was huge,"" said Imre
Speizer, a senior strategist at Westpac Bank in Wellington.
""They said they will intervene and the whole world will
intervene. This is much bigger than earlier expected."" 
 Stocks were generally buoyant, particularly in emerging
markets.
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 2.7 percent, but still
closed down around 10 percent on the week, which wiped $350
billion off the stock market.
 ""The main things investors are worried about now are the
nuclear plant, the impact of the earthquake and tsunami on firms
and power cuts putting pressure on Japanese manufacturers,"" said
Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.
 The yen's surge had initially been prompted by expectations
insurance companies and other firms would repatriate funds to
meet the massive reconstruction costs of the disaster.
 Then a wave of stop-losses and options-related selling
kicked in, propelling the yen past its previous record of 79.75
per dollar that occurred in the wake of the 1995 Kobe
earthquake.
 
 OIL RISES
 Japan's strongest earthquake on record a week ago raised
concerns of reduced demand from the world's third-largest oil
user and triggered a drop in Brent to a three-week low near $107
two days ago.
 ""The initial shock in the markets with regards to the
negative impact on growth as well as the short-term effect on
Japanese demand is now subsiding and people are turning to the
medium- and long-term implications of the earthquake on oil
demand and turmoil intensifying in the Middle East,"" said Yingxi
Yu, a Singapore-based commodities analyst with Barclays Capital.
 The involvement of foreign forces in Libya ""could prove to
be a further escalation of the situation in Libya. It seems
difficult that this will speed up the flow of Libyan oil back
into the world market,"" Yu added.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2011 03:56AM ET</span>","Bubble trouble spoils China's ""art shares"" party"," BEIJING, March 18 (Reuters) - China's maiden ""art stock
exchange"" has halted trade in its top two paintings after their
share prices soared 1,700 percent and ignited concerns that a new
bubble was bursting.
 Just two months after the Tianjin Cultural Artwork Exchange
listed shares in two Chinese paintings, the bourse said it was
pulling the paintings from trade to ""reduce investment risks and
protect investor rights"".
 Wild asset price swings are not uncommon in China, where
markets are often dominated by ordinary people who have few
viable investment channels and earn little, if any, interest on
bank deposits.
 In the past three years alone, items as varied as garlic,
mung beans and ant-based aphrodisiacs have all experienced
investment frenzies.
 The Chinese art market was also seen by many critics as a
bubble in 2008 when auction prices soared. But the boom in art
shares was something entirely new.
 The Tianjin art exchange, which opened in January, operates
by listing works of art and then offering investors fractional
ownership.
 The two paintings yanked from trade were Roaring Yellow River
and the Autumn in Fortress.
 Exchange data showed that on its last day of trade this week,
shares in Roaring Yellow River traded at 17.2 yuan ($2.62),
compared with their issue price of 1 yuan.
 That valued the canvas by modern Chinese painter Bai Gengyan
at 103 million yuan ($15.7 million), nearly 52 times the highest
price that Bai's paintings had ever fetched in a public auction.
 But it is not the end of the road for the Tianjin art
exchange, which says on its website that its goals are to promote
""financial innovation"" and ""broaden channels for the public to
participate in high-end artwork investment"".
 It listed seven new paintings and a diamond on March 11. They
have gone up by 15 percent -- the maximum daily gain according to
exchange rules -- in every trading day since then.

 By Sui-Lee Wee	
 BEIJING, March 18 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation
believes the spread of radiation from a quake-crippled nuclear
plant in Japan remains limited and appears to pose no immediate
risk to health, the WHO's China representative said on Friday.	
 ""At this point, there is still no evidence that there's been
significant radiation spread beyond the immediate zone of the
reactors themselves,"" Michael O'Leary told a group of reporters.	
 ""At the same time, we know that the situation is evolving
and we need to monitor closely and see what happens over time.
Things can obviously change, and have changed, over this last
week.""	
 The WHO, he said, ""coordinates a network of experts on
nuclear health issues which it draws on"" for advice and would
remain in close contact with Japan's government, the
International Atomic Energy Agency and other groups.	
 Japan has been battling for nearly a week to bring under
control the overheating Fukushima nuclear plant after it was
battered by a massive earthquake and tsunami.	
 Experts and officials fear a major leak of radioactive
substances from the plant could pose a serious health risk, and
China and nearby countries have stepped up monitoring of
radiation levels.	
 O'Leary suggested that the impact of such an event on China
would be small, but said other factors mattered too.	
 ""The reactors, of course, are quite far from China. The risk
of spread depends on several factors. One is obviously the
amount of radioactive material, or radionuclides, that are
released from the reactor itself. Beyond that are weather and
wind conditions that determine,"" he said.	
 ""As with anything that spreads or can spread out, the
farther away you are, the more dispersed it is.""	
 The emergency has sparked panic buying of iodised salt in
China, based on the misunderstanding that the iodine it contains
could prevent the body's intake of radioactive iodine that could
be released in the event of a major explosion at the plant.	
 But O'Leary said iodine should not be taken indiscriminately
or treated as a substitute for supplements administered before
or shortly after radiation exposure to reduce the risk of
long-term cancer.	
 ""It should not be taken indiscrminately. It does have
potential side effects,"" he said.	
 ""The amount of iodine in salt is very small. It wouldn't be
possible to consume enough salt to get a protective dose. In the

(Updates with official denial)	
 By Leika Kihara and Rie Ishiguro	
 TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japan has no plans to ask the
central bank to underwrite bonds Tokyo may issue to fund relief
and reconstruction after last week's deadly earthquake, top
government officials said on Friday, denying an earlier
newspaper report. 
 Earlier on Friday, Sankei newspaper cited ""several
government sources"" as saying that the government planned to
issue more than 10 trillion yen ($126.8 billion) in emergency
bonds which would be taken up in full by the central bank.	
 The newspaper said that even though the law prohibited the
BOJ from directly underwriting government debt it allowed for
exceptions under ""special circumstances"" and that the worst
quake to hit Japan in recorded history easily qualified as one.	
 Government ministers, however, no such plan was being
discussed.	
 ""The BOJ is not allowed by law to directly underwrite
government bonds... There is ample liquidity at households and
companies and the government would have no problem raising the
amount of money that is floating around,"" Economy Minister Kaoru
Yosano told an news conference.	
 ""The BOJ won't be called to take special steps. That I can
say with certainty.""	
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda also brushed off the report
and stressed that the government had no difficulty in raising
funds in the market and any proposals to seek direct 
 ""A cautious debate would be needed on whether to have the
Bank of Japan directly underwrite JGBs (Japanese government
bonds),"" Noda told reporters.	
 ""The 20-year bond auction has been conducted smoothly so the
market is smoothly digesting JGBs. I'm aware that various people
have various opinions on this, but the government is not
specifically considering it.""	
 Yosano told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the
total damage to the economy form a triple blow of an earthquake,
a tsunami and a nuclear crisis would exceed 20 trillion yen,
which he said was the overall economic cost of the Kobe quake in
1995. 
 He also said that the emergency budget needed to fund the
economic repair looked certain to exceed 3.3 trillion yen Tokyo
mobilised after the Kobe earthquake.	
 But he said the government should have no difficulty funding
the extra effort which might require issuing several trillion
yen in new bonds. 
 Sankei said the Democratic Party-led government could save
money for disaster relief by dropping some of its costly
spending plans, such as extended child support benefits, but
that could bring 3.3 trillion yen at the most.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japanese shares jumped nearly 2
percent and the yen tumbled on Friday after the G7 agreed on
joint intervention to curb the currency's strength, but a
sustained stock rally may have to wait until the full impact of
a devastating earthquake and nuclear reactor crisis becomes
clearer.	
 The move by the club of rich nations to support the country
as Japan struggles to cope with its biggest crisis since World
War Two comes a day after the yen soared to a record 76.25
in chaotic trading, and a week after the deadly quake and
tsunami struck. 
 Stock markets elsewhere in Asia also rose on the G7 bid to
stabilise global markets, as well as gains on Wall Street
overnight, with the MSCI ex-Japan index up 1.1
percent.	
 ""This is the first coordinated intervention we have seen
since 2000, so it's going to have a very huge resonating effect
on the market,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research
at GFT in New York.	
 The dollar spiked nearly 3 percent to a high of 81.49 after
the announcement of joint intervention, which came just as Tokyo
stock markets opened. It was later trading just below that
around 81.45 yen . Traders said the Bank of Japan had been
spotted buying dollars. 
 The Nikkei share average rose 1.8 percent, but was
still down around 11 percent on the week and headed for its
biggest weekly slide since the 2008 financial crisis. Volume was
near normal levels after the frantic trading seen earlier in the
week. Japanese government bond futures fell.	
 Japanese stocks suffered their worst two-day slide since the
1987 crash on Monday and Tuesday, following the 9.0 magnitude
earthquake and devastating tsunami that killed thousands and
crippled a nuclear power plant about 240 km (150 miles) north of
Tokyo.	
 Workers were still struggling to cool overheating reactors
and prevent further radiation leaks on Friday. 
 Shares of big exporters, whose profits are eroded by a
stronger yen, were prominent among the gainers on Friday as the
G7 pushed the currency lower. Tokyo Electron rose 3.8
percent and Kyocera 3.5 percent.	
 But traders said much of the gains were from short-covering,
and the index may stall next week as investors wait to assess
the full economic and human cost of the quake and the success of
efforts to prevent a catastrophic radiation leak from the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex.	
 ""The main things investors are worried about now are the
nuclear plant, the impact of the earthquake and tsunami on firms
and power cuts putting pressure on Japanese manufacturers,"" said
Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.	
 Investors will be waiting for earnings figures and forecasts
in late April and early May for a better sense of how the triple
disaster will affect individual companies.	
 ""This correction will be very long,"" said Tetsuro Ii, CEO of
Commons Asset Management.""	
""We have the nuclear problems and impact of the quake on the
economy, which is still hard to assess. I can't see the index
bouncing back quickly to levels from before the quake.""	
 
 ""NERVOUS BATTLE""	
 The yen's surge had initially been prompted by expectations
of insurance companies and others repatriating funds to meet
reconstruction costs, and was exacerbated when a wave of
stop-losses and options-related selling kicked in.	
 Traders said the dollar's move above 81 yen would put
further pressure on players to unwind long yen positions.	
 ""Were we to break up 81-81.25, it would certainly mean that
the speculators who had been trying to front-run repatriation
would feel very, very uncomfortable,"" said Robert Rennie, chief
currency strategist at Westpac Bank in Australia. 
 But others doubted the longer term effectiveness of
intervention, given the past experiences of the Bank of Japan
and Swiss National Bank. 
 ""It looks like we'll see a nervous battle between the BOJ
and the speculators,"" Norihiro Fujito, senior investment
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.	
 ""Hedge funds have expanded their asset holdings to
unprecedented levels, so even if it's a coordinated
intervention, effectively it may be similar to one-country
intervention, so looking mid- long-term, I'm not sure if they'll
be able to curb it.""

 Japanese government bond benchmark 10-year futures
fell 0.08 point to 139.62, while the 10-year yield

didn't fall much over the past few days due to caution over the
Japanese government's fiscal position,"" said Hidenori Suezawa,
chief strategist, Nikko Cordial Securities	
 ""Stock and forex markets are reacting more vividly as their
moves were much sharper than JGBs after the earthquake.""

 * More intervention expected if USD/JPY falls towards 80

 By Hideyuki Sano and Ian Chua	
 TOKYO/SYDNEY, March 18 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled more than
3 percent on Friday after Group of Seven finance ministers
agreed to immediately and jointly intervene against the Japanese
currency's surge to a record peak, with Bank of Japan buying
pushing the dollar above 81 yen.	
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan agreed
with central banks of the United States, Britain and Canada as
well as the European Central Bank to jointly intervene in the
currency market. Markets were caught off guard by the first
joint action in over a decade, expecting Japan to have to act
alone.	
 Traders said the Bank of Japan was immediately spotted
buying dollars versus the yen, though it seemed to be meeting
heavy offers. Each respective central bank agreed to intervene
and sell the yen when their respective markets open.	
 Market players expected Japan and other central banks to
keep intervening if the dollar threatened to fall back below 80
yen and make a run at the 76.25 all-time low struck this week.
The G7 has long warned against excessive volatility in exchange
rates.	
 But many traders were expected to need to unload dollars at
higher levels and slow any advance, especially after Thursday's
shocking plunge in dollar/yen that saw it collapse more than 4
percent in just an hour.	
 ""It is a positive surprise,"" said Mitsuru Sahara, chief FX
manager at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi-UFJ in Tokyo.	
 ""The impact will be there, as it is difficult now to sell
the dollar below 80 yen ... I think it is aimed at preventing a
sharp plunge and bringing dollar/yen back up to levels before it
started plunging, rather than trying to push it higher above 85
yen. I don't expect follow-up interventions to the upside.""	
 The dollar's gains slowed after the initial burst higher,
with Japanese exporters and traders stuck with long yen
positions using the opportunity to unload. Some individual
Japanese margin traders were also spotted selling dollars.	
 The rare G7 joint intervention capped a frantic week for
Japanese markets that saw the Nikkei suffer its worst
two-day rout since the 1987 crash and the yen soaring as
investors watched the country's nuclear crisis escalate.	
 The dollar jumped 3.3 percent on the day to as high as 81.50
yen on trading platform EBS, extending a rebound from a
record low of 76.25 yen plumbed on Thursday.	
 The sell off in the previous session came after a break of
the 1995 record low of 79.75 triggered a cascade of automatic
sell orders, some tied to leveraged positions and structured FX
derivatives, in thin trade between the U.S. and Asian trading
days.	
 The yen has climbed steadily since last week's earthquake,
as Japanese and international investors closed long positions in
higher-yielding, riskier assets such as the Australian dollar,
funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency. 
Expectations that Japanese insurers and companies will bring
money home to pay for claims and reconstruction also contributed
to the yen's strength.

 The euro jumped 3.5 percent to 114.60 yen ,
boosted in part by comments from Japanese Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda that the European Central Bank may intervene in
euro/yen. 
 Commodity currencies, such as the Australian dollar,
performed even better and recovered a bit from their recent
hammering.	
 The Aussie surged 4.2 percent to 80.75 yen and
was up 1 percent against the dollar at $0.9916 .	
 
 WILL INTERVENTION BE SUCCESSFUL?	
 Some analysts doubted any intervention would be effective,
given past experiences by the Bank of Japan and the Swiss
National Bank.	
 ""Intervention is no panacea. Everyone knows it. Japan has a
much bigger credibility problem and that'll weaken the impact,""
said David Gilmore, a partner in FX Analytics in Essex,
Connecticut.	
 ""I don't think we've seen the low in the dollar/yen. There's
still a lot of carry trade exposure. The world is really levered
up on this.""	
 Other analysts said intervention may be more effective this
time than it was in September when Japan spent $26 billion to
weaken the yen but failed to ensure a lasting dollar rally. 
The cost of hedging against a further yen rise fell, with
implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen options
trading at around 16 percent, down from near 21 percent on
Thursday and showing the market calming a bit.	
 Views that ECB was likely to lift interest rates soon also
helped underpinned the common currency, which last stood at
$1.4070 and was poised to make a run at the November 2010
peak and chart resistance near $1.4280.	
 The dollar bounced off a record low of 0.8852 Swiss francs
and was up 1 percent at 0.9065 francs. The franc had
benefited from the recent market turmoil as it is usually seen a
safe port in a storm.	
 The franc had earlier edged up after the U.N Security
Council voted to authorise a no-fly zone over Libya, prompting
further gains in oil prices.

 TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japanese shares jumped nearly 3
percent and the yen tumbled on Friday after the Group of Seven
agreed on rare joint intervention to curb the soaring currency
and calm markets jittery over Japan's nuclear power plant
crisis.	
 But the stock rally does not mean dramatic gyrations seen
this week are over because the crisis at the power plant is
still unfolding and the full impact of last Friday's devastating
earthquake and tsunami is not clear, dealers said.	
 The move by the G7 to support the country as Japan struggles
to cope with its biggest crisis since World War Two comes a day
after the yen soared to a record 76.25 in chaotic
trading.	
 The dollar rose more than 3 percent to around 81.75 yen
after the G7 announcement, which came just as the Tokyo stock
market opened.	
 ""It was as clear as it could be and it was huge,"" said Imre
Speizer, a senior strategist at Westpac Bank in Wellington.
""They said they will intervene and the whole world will
intervene. This is much bigger than earlier expected."" 
""This is huge and it's having commercial effect. There can be
a lot more upside in dollar/yen before the next 24 hours is
over. Global coordinated intervention is very rare, but when it
occurs it is usually very successful.""	
 Equity markets elsewhere in Asia rose after the G7 bid to
stabilise global markets, with the MSCI ex-Japan index
up 1.3 percent.	
 
 The G7 decision following a teleconference surprised
markets. Investors had expected Bank of Japan to intervene to
rein in the rampant yen, but had not expected coordinated
central bank action by the world's wealthiest countries.	
 ""This is the first coordinated intervention we have seen
since 2000, so it's going to have a very huge resonating effect
on the market,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research
at GFT in New York.	
 Traders said the Bank of Japan was immediately spotted
buying dollars. Media reports and traders said it is likely to
have bought more than $25 billion. 
 The Nikkei share average rose 2.7 percent, but still
closed down around 10 percent on the week, which wiped $350
billion off the stock market.	
 The drop marked its biggest weekly slide since the 2008
global financial crisis. Trading volume was closer to normal on
Friday after the frantic trading earlier this week.	
 Japanese government bond futures were little
changed, while the spread on benchmark credit default swaps --
the cost of insuring against a sovereign default -- tightened.	
 Japanese stocks suffered their worst two-day slide on Monday
and Tuesday since the 1987 global stock market crash. That
followed a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and devastating tsunami on
Friday that killed thousands and crippled the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear power complex about 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.	
 Workers were struggling on Friday in the latest attempt to
cool overheating reactors and prevent further radiation leaks.	
 
 LONG CORRECTION?	
 Shares of exporters, whose profits are eroded by a stronger
yen, were prominent among the gainers on Friday as the G7 pushed
the currency lower. Fujifilm rose 6.6 percent and
electronic firm Kyocera gained 5.2 percent.	
 But traders said much of the gains were from short-covering,
and the index may stall next week as investors wait to assess
the full economic and human cost of the quake and efforts to
prevent a catastrophic radiation leak from the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear complex.	
 ""The main things investors are worried about now are the
nuclear plant, the impact of the earthquake and tsunami on firms
and power cuts putting pressure on Japanese manufacturers,"" said
Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.	
 Investors will be waiting for earnings figures and forecasts
in late April and early May for a better sense of how the triple
disaster will affect individual companies.	
 ""This correction will be very long,"" said Tetsuro Ii, CEO of
Commons Asset Management.	
 ""We have the nuclear problems and impact of the quake on the
economy, which is still hard to assess. I can't see the index
bouncing back quickly to levels from before the quake.""	
 
 ""NERVOUS BATTLE""	
 The yen's surge had initially been prompted by expectations
insurance companies and other firms would repatriate funds to
meet the massive reconstruction costs of the disaster.	
 The move was exacerbated when a wave of stop-losses and
options-related selling kicked in, propelling the yen past its
previous record of 79.75 per dollar that occurred in the wake of
the 1995 Kobe earthquake.	
 Traders said the yen's retreat beyond 81 yen on Friday would
put pressure on investors to unwind long yen positions.	
 But others doubted the longer-term effectiveness of
intervention, given the past experiences of the Bank of Japan
and Swiss National Bank.	
 ""It looks like we'll see a nervous battle between the BOJ
and the speculators,"" Norihiro Fujito, senior investment
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.	
 ""Hedge funds have expanded their asset holdings to
unprecedented levels, so even if it's a coordinated
intervention, effectively it may be similar to one-country
intervention. So looking mid- long-term, I'm not sure if they'll
be able to curb it.""	
 Benchmark Japanese government 10-year bond futures
fell early on, but recovered to close up 0.04 point to 139.74,
while the 10-year yield on the cash bond edged up
1 basis point to 1.210 percent.	
 ""The crisis is pouring cold water on the Japanese economy.
Personal consumption will be weighed by concerns over
electricity shortages,"" said Nobuto Yamazaki, executive fund
manager at DIAM Asset Management.	
 ""Given such an environment, we can't expect a so-called
'good yield rise' in the near future. What would push up the
yield of JGBs would be a worsening of Japan's fiscal
positioning.""	
 Benchmark five-year credit default swaps
tightened around 10 basis points to about 110 basis points.

 TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven industrial
nations agreed on Friday to jointly intervene in the currency
market to stem a sharp yen rise that complicates Japan's battle
with the devastation caused by last week's violent earthquake
and an unfolding nuclear crisis.	
 ""Given yen moves after the tragic events that hit Japan, the
United States, Britain, Canada and the European Central Bank
have agreed with Japan to jointly intervene in the currency
market,"" Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told reporters. 
 Japanese authorities will buy dollar/yen in the market from
9 a.m. (0000 GMT). Other central banks will act when their
markets open, Noda said. He declined to comment on the size of
Tokyo's intervention.	
 ""When Japan is in such a state, it's extremely meaningful
for G7 countries to cooperate and take coordinated action to
stabilise financial markets,"" he said.	
 The dollar spiked about 2 yen to above 81 yen on Friday,
after the news, moving away from a record low against the
Japanese currency hit earlier this week.	
 Tokyo last intervened in the currency market on its own on
Sept. 15, 2010, when it sold 2.13 trillion yen, a record amount

 By Leika Kihara and Kristina Cooke
 TOKYO/NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - Japan bought billions
of dollars to restrain a soaring yen on Friday, backed by
action from European central banks as the world's richest
nations moved to calm markets made nervous by Japan's nuclear
crisis.
 The moves are the first joint intervention in currency
markets by the Group of Seven leading powers since they came to
the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000, and signal the
weight of concern about the wider impact of events in Japan.
 The U.S. dollar surged two full yen to as much as 81.98 yen
 in response, up from a record low of 76.25 hit on
Thursday, with traders estimating the Bank of Japan bought more
than $25 billion.
 A series of European central banks confirmed they were
intervening and stock markets surged, although dealers said the
initial intervention had been much smaller in scale than the
Bank of Japan's and the impact in European time was more
limited.
 Ahead of North American market openings, the Federal
Reserve and Bank of Canada confirmed that they had joined the
intervention as well -- a show of resolve to market
participants that the whole G7 was solidly behind Japan.
 No figures were available for how much they may have
committed but analysts said the point was to show unity.
 ""It's going to have a very huge resonating effect on the
market,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT
in New York.
 ""Because the only type of intervention that actually works
is coordinated intervention and it shows the solidarity of all
central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in
Japan.""
 The decision by the G7 came as a surprise to many because
Tokyo had indicated it was looking only for moral support for
its attempts to assuage markets rather than joint action.
 Japan's Nikkei share index <.N225> climbed close to 3
percent, recouping some of the week's stinging losses as Japan
reeled from an earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear power plant
crisis. The market's losses for the week are 10 percent.

 A source told Reuters the BOJ would also leave the yen it
sold in the banking system rather than mopping it up, thus
adding to the vast amount of liquidity it had already provided
to support its domestic markets.
 Central banks will often issue bonds to soak up any extra
cash in the economy that results from currency intervention for
fear that the additional liquidity could fuel inflation.
 WIDER CONCERN
 G7 financial leaders may be worried that a surge in yen
repatriation could create a crisis of confidence in markets
already struggling in the face of Europe's debt problems and
the impact of unrest in the Middle East.
 President Barack Obama underlined the concern in Washington
by saying on Thursday the United States would do all it can to
help Japan recover while playing down fears a drifting cloud of
radiation could reach the U.S. West Coast.
 Japan's triple disaster, unprecedented in a major developed
economy, is already disrupting global manufacturing.
 Makers of equipment for mobile telephones to car makers and
chipmakers have warned of a squeeze on their businesses given
Japan's crucial role in many supply chains that keep global
commerce ticking over.
 ""I think the world economy is going to go right down, and
it has happened at a time when financial markets are still
fragile,"" said a G7 central banker who declined to be named.
 The yen's surge this week was driven by speculation that
Japanese firms would repatriate some of their huge foreign
assets to help meet insurance claims and pay for
reconstruction.
 That added to a bullish run for the currency in past years,
driven by its status as a ""safe haven"" since the 2008 financial
crisis and investors' use of it as a very low-interest funding
currency for more risky investments.
 An even stronger yen could make it more difficult for
exporters in the world's third largest economy to recover from
the triple blow of last week's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear
threat. The damage toll is already estimated at up to $200
billion with Japan almost certain to slip back into recession.
 ""The aim is obviously to support our Japanese partner,
express our solidarity and obviously to halt the yen's rise,""
French finance minister Christine Lagarde told French radio.
 ""The country has suffered enough catastrophe and calamity
to try to avoid, in addition, a deep economic and then
financial crisis resulting from a rising currency and
preventing the Japanese from exporting as they usually do.""
 Investors were also keeping a wary eye on events in Libya.
Oil prices fell on Friday after the country's foreign minister
said Libya would halt all military action and accepted a United
Nations resolution for an immediate ceasefire.
 The U.N. on Thursday voted to impose a no-fly zone over
Libya and to use all necessary measures to protect civilians.

 Undeterred by events in Japan, China raised its required
reserve rate for banks, tightening monetary policy for the
third time this year. [ID:nTOE722076]
 HISTORY NOT IN FAVOUR
 Still, if past is prologue, even massive official selling
might not restrain the yen for long.
 When Japan last intervened in September 2010, it sold a
huge 2.1 trillion yen, equivalent then to around $25 billion,
but only managed to push the dollar up from 82.85 to 85.77
yen.
 The euro  and sterling  jumped as much as
2-3 percent against the yen after the G7 statement but they
later retreated.
 ""The intervention needs to be concerted and aggressive ...
and even then I'm sceptical,"" said one trader in London.
 Analysts from U.S.-based Citibank said the history of G7
action suggested the moves could reverse the yen's uptrend in
the long run.
 ""In terms of yen, the typical example of joint intervention
is the Washington G7 in 1995. At the time USDJPY ended its long
years downward trend and turned into an uptrend,"" they said.

 By Silvio Cascione and Michael O'Boyle
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, March 17 (Reuters) - Brazil's real
slumped on Thursday on fears of new capital controls even as
the rest of Latin America's currencies rallied in a sign of the
region's potential to gain if fears ease about Japan's nuclear
crisis.
 Brazilian markets have been on edge about new measures from
the government to curb the real's strength. Traders are also
nervous about any sign Japanese investors could pull out of big
bets on the real.
 The currency hit a two-month low as news alerts made
traders believe a new government tax on financial transactions
was in the works. But the news was in fact tied to a tax in the
beverage sector.
 ""In the middle of all this news, people who sold off set
off stop losses,"" said Jorge Knauer, director of the treasury
at Banco Prosper in Rio de Janeiro.
 ""Everybody's nerves are on edge. People are looking at
liquidity, looking at the central bank site to see if they've
got measures out,"" he added.
 Brazil's real  bid 0.72 percent weaker at 1.684 per
dollar.
 Analysts said they had seen little sign yet that Japanese
investors were pulling out of Brazil after investing billions
of dollars in Latin America's top economy in recent years.
 ""There are some rumors, bad information, about the
possibility that Japanese investments could be unwound. We
don't see this. There have even been inflows in the past couple
days,"" said Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura Securities in
New York.
 However, a much sharper depreciation of the real could spur
outflows as investors see their bets turn sour. A finance
ministry source told Reuters on Tuesday that the government has
put off plans to step up intervention efforts to undermine the
real's strength for now.
 Other key Latin American currencies firmed, rebounding from
the prior session's losses triggered by Japan's nuclear crisis.
Uncertainty about the risks from the crisis at the
earthquake-hit reactors in Japan is likely keep markets
volatile. [ID:nL3E7EH18S]
 ""The news in Japan is not getting any worse today, so the
market bounced on that. But I would not read too much into the
rebound until we get much more information on how the Japanese
situation will evolve,"" said Pedro Tuesta, an analyst at
consultancy 4Cast in Washington.
 Many analysts expect the region's currencies to gain if
concerns about a nuclear catastrophe ease.
 Mexico's peso  firmed 1.12 percent to 12.09 per
dollar. Chile's peso  closed nearly flat at 486.20 per
dollar ahead of a monetary policy decision.
 After the local market close, the country's central bank
surprised markets with a 50-basis-point hike to 4.00 percent.
Most economists had been expecting a 25-basis-point hike.
[ID:nSAG002757]
 Higher interest rates could help the Chilean peso bounce
back if global jitters ease. Chile's peso has also suffered in
recent weeks due to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
that has heightened supply concerns.
 Chile imports most of its oil, unlike exporters Mexico and
Colombia and self-sufficient Brazil.
 Colombia's peso jumped after the Andean nation's debt was
upgraded to investment grade by Standard & Poor's and traders
bet other agencies will soon follow.
 The peso  firmed 0.66 percent to 1880.35 per
dollar. [ID:nN17129788]

 (Updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - The yen edged off a record
high against the dollar on Thursday ahead of a conference call
by Group of Seven finance ministers on fears officials may soon
intervene to rein in the currency's rapid rise.
 The dollar hit a record low of 76.25 yen  on
trading platform EBS. Asian trading began after a break of the
previous record low of 79.75 triggered a cascade of automatic
""sell"" orders. The dollar later bounced back to hover around 79
yen.
 G7 finance officials will hold talks via conference call
from around 6 p.m. (2200 GMT), and traders said the market may
trim lingering yen longs shortly before that, which could push
the dollar toward its session peak around 79.75 yen.
 A Dow Jones news report quoted an unnamed source as saying
Japan's ministry was ""ready for battle"" on the yen. A G7 source
said G7 nations are not expected to agree firm policy action
but will offer solidarity to Japan and review its plight. For
details, see [ID:nL3E7EH097] [ID:nLDE72G10U]
 ""We believe that unilateral intervention with the approval
of the G7 is likely following tonight's meeting and that joint
intervention or a one off coordinated response is possible,""
said Sara Yates, currency strategist at Barclays Capital in
London.
 ""However, we believe the main motivation for this will be
to 'lean against the wind' and prevent a rapid and potentially
destabilizing appreciation of the yen, rather than to depress
the yen over time,"" Yates said.
 The yen has seen steady buying since last week's
earthquake, as Japanese and international investors closed long
positions in higher-yielding, riskier assets such as the
Australian dollar, funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese
currency.
 Expectations that Japanese insurers and companies will
start bringing money home to pay for claims and reconstruction
may also have helped boost the yen.
 Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, blamed
speculation for the yen spike and said he was closely watching
markets, a warning that authorities may soon buy dollars. See

 The dollar rebound was driven partly by Japanese importers
and some retail margin traders. The latter were cited as a main
factor behind the earlier plunge, with the speed of the decline
-- the dollar shed more than three yen in about 20 minutes --
forcing them to dump trades financed with borrowed yen.
 CHANCE OF SUCCESS HARD TO PREDICT
 G20 deputies held a conference call to discuss the crisis
in Japan on Thursday but the talks did not broach currency
exchange rates. See [ID:nLDE72G284]
 Some analysts doubted any intervention would be effective,
given past experiences by the Bank of Japan and the Swiss
National Bank.
 ""Intervention is no panacea. Everyone knows it. Japan has a
much bigger credibility problem and that'll weaken the impact,""
said David Gilmore, a partner in FX Analytics in Essex,
Connecticut.
 ""I don't think we've seen the low in the dollar/yen.
There's still a lot of carry trade exposure. The world is
really levered up on this,"" he said.
 Other analysts said intervention may be more effective this
time than it was in September when Japan spent $26 billion to
weaken the yen but failed to ensure a lasting dollar rally.
 ""This entire move can be pinned down to speculative
positioning rather than any repatriation flows,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. ""Since
it is speculative, intervention in this case should work and
clear out some of the long yen positions.""
 The cost of hedging against a further yen rise jumped, with
implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen  trading
close to 20 percent, though still below levels seen at the peak
of the 2008 global financial crisis.
 Absent intervention, there's little to stand in the way of
further yen gains, said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche Bank's global
head of G10 currency strategy.
 ""The Japanese probably did themselves a bad turn when it
comes to credibility"" by not stepping in sooner, Ruskin said.
 ""People may be more inclined to fight intervention now than
they would have been yesterday, and it looks like active types
are looking to sell upticks,"" he added.
 The euro hit a 2011 high of $1.40534 on EBS  after
solid demand at a Spanish bond auction and on the view that
euro zone interest rates were likely to rise soon. It was last
up 0.9 percent at $1.4025.
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.8852 Swiss francs
 before bouncing back above 0.90 francs. While the
Swiss central bank kept interest rates steady, the franc got a
bid from investors who see it as a safe port in a storm.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - European and U.S. stocks
rebounded from three days of selling on Thursday despite no
resolution to Japan's nuclear plant crisis, while the yen edged
off a record high against the U.S. dollar.
 Despite the rise in stocks, fear still clouded markets
across the globe as Japan's responses to its worsening nuclear
disaster looked increasingly desperate. New issues in the stock
and loans markets were postponed and equity trading volumes
dipped.
 Fears that tensions in the Middle East and North Africa
added to the unease weighing on markets and drove oil prices up
nearly 4 percent.
 The yen's strength may also have reflected expectations
that Japanese investors would sell overseas assets to bring
home funds to pay for reconstruction after Friday's earthquake
and tsunami. The yen hit a record high against the dollar of
76.25 yen  as Asian markets began trading.
 The Group of Seven finance leaders and central bankers
planned to hold a conference call later on Thursday. Currency
traders have interpreted remarks by some officials as
indicating other central banks may give Japan their blessing to
intervene to drive the yen lower against the dollar.
[ID:nLDE72G10U]
 The three-day decline in stocks brought back bargain
hunters, but volume on Wall Street was lackluster.
 Developments at Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant still
unnerved investors. Japanese military helicopters dumped water
and a water canon was used on an overheating nuclear reactor,
but radiation levels at the plant remained high. For details,
see [ID:nL3E7EH18S]
 ""As the headlines come out of Japan, there are more nervous
traders liquidating their long positions in futures put on this
morning,"" said Steve Leuer, stock-index futures trader at X-FA
Trading firm in Chicago.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 1.3
percent after hitting a three-month low earlier in the week.
The index has now erased all of this year's gains.
 Tokyo stocks ended down 1.4 percent <.N225> on Thursday.
Earlier this week, Japanese stocks suffered their worst two-day
selloff since 1987.
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> gained

the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 19.23 points, or
0.73 percent, to 2,636.05.
 The index known as Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX,
<.VIX>, fell 9 percent to 26.77 on Thursday, a day after
hitting its highest level since July.
 Natural resource stocks were among key leaders as
commodities rebounded. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc 
rose 5.8 percent to $88.60 and Chevron Corp  gained 2.7
percent to $102.24.
 The S&P energy index <.GSPE> rose 3 percent, leading gains
in the S&P 500, even though the prospect of higher fuel costs
have tempered stock investor enthusiasm in recent weeks.
 Many traders warned there were still reasons to be cautious
as Japan had yet to contain its nuclear problem, which could
exacerbate the natural disaster's economic toll.
 ""The drop has been violent, but the news flow remains very
alarming,"" said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales
trading at Global Equities in Paris. ""There is short covering
at this point, and we continue to see outflows.
 ""Stocks might look oversold on the short term, but they are

biggest casuatly of choppy markets.
 Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> fell 0.6 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  rose 3.4 percent to settle at $101.42
a barrel. Brent crude  for May delivery settled up 3.89
percent at $114.90, after hitting a session high of $115.39. It
was the biggest one-day percentage gain since Feb. 23. as
unrest in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Libya heightened concern
about supply disruption while investors weighed the impact on
energy demand from Japan.
 The state-owned Bahrain Petroleum Co has partly shut down
production due to staff shortages caused by political unrest in
Bahrain, trade sources said. Bahrain arrested at least six
opposition leaders, a day after its crackdown on protests by
the Shi'ite Muslim majority raised fears of a regional
conflict. [ID:nLDE72F2Q5][ID:nLDE72G110]
 INTERVENTION THREAT
 In New York, the yen traded at around 78.96 per dollar, off
the record high set overnight.
 Japanese margin traders were cited as one of the main
factors behind the dollar's fall against the yen, as the break
of the yen's prior record high triggered automatic sell
orders.
 Traders also said foreign investors were scrambling to get
hold of yen to settle margin calls on bets on Japanese shares,
forcing them to turn to spot currency at times as well as
forwards  and cross-currency swaps .
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda blamed speculation
for the yen spike.
 The dollar <.DXY> hit a four-month low against a basket of
major currencies. The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.4016 .
 Stabilization in Western stock markets reduced demand for

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - The yen edged off a record
high against the dollar on Thursday ahead of a conference call
by Group of Seven finance ministers on fears that officials may
soon intervene to rein in the currency's rapid rise.
 The dollar hit a record low of 76.25 yen on trading
platform EBS as Asian trading began after a break of the
previous record low of 79.75 triggered a cascade of automatic
""sell"" orders. The dollar later bounced back to hover around 79
yen.
 G7 finance officials will hold talks via conference call
from around 6 p.m. (2200 GMT), and traders said the market may
trim lingering yen longs shortly before that, which could push
the dollar toward its session peak around 79.75 yen.
 A Dow Jones news report quoted an unnamed source as saying
Japan's ministry was ""ready for battle"" on the yen. A G7 source
said G7 nations are not expected to agree firm policy action
but will offer solidarity to Japan and review its plight. For
details, see
 ""We believe that unilateral intervention with the approval
of the G7 is likely following tonight's meeting and that joint
intervention or a one off coordinated response is possible,""
said Sara Yates, currency strategist at Barclays Capital in
London.
 ""However, we believe the main motivation for this will be
to 'lean against the wind' and prevent a rapid and potentially
destabilizing appreciation of the yen, rather than to depress
the yen over time,"" Yates said.
 The yen has seen steady buying since last week's
earthquake, as Japanese and international investors closed long
positions in higher-yielding, riskier assets such as the
Australian dollar, funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese
currency.
 Expectations that Japanese insurers and companies will
start bringing money home to pay for claims and reconstruction
may also have helped boosted the yen.
 Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, blamed
speculation for the yen spike and said he was closely watching
markets, a warning that authorities may soon buy dollars. See
and some retail margin traders. The latter were cited as a main
factor behind the earlier plunge, with the speed of the decline
-- the dollar shed more than three yen in about 20 minutes --
forcing them to dump trades financed with borrowed yen.
 CHANCE OF SUCCESS HARD TO PREDICT
 G20 deputies held a conference call to discuss the crisis
in Japan on Thursday but the talks did not broach currency
exchange rates.
 Some analysts doubted any intervention would be effective,
given past experiences by the Bank of Japan and the Swiss
National Bank.
 ""Intervention is no panacea. Everyone knows it. Japan has a
much bigger credibility problem and that'll weaken the impact,""
said David Gilmore, a partner in FX Analytics in Essex,
Connecticut.
 ""I don't think we've seen the low in the dollar/yen.
There's still a lot of carry trade exposure. The world is
really levered up on this,"" he said.
 Other analysts said intervention may be more effective this
time than it was in September when Japan spent $26 billion to
weaken the yen but failed to ensure a lasting dollar rally.
 ""This entire move can be pinned down to speculative
positioning rather than any repatriation flows,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. ""Since
it is speculative, intervention in this case should work and
clear out some of the long yen positions.""
 The cost of hedging against a further yen rise jumped, with
implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen trading close to 20
percent, though still below levels seen at the peak of the 2008
global financial crisis.
 Absent intervention, there's little to stand in the way of
further yen gains, said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche Bank's global
head of G10 currency strategy.
 ""The Japanese probably did themselves a bad turn when it
comes to credibility"" by not stepping in sooner, Ruskin said.
 ""People may be more inclined to fight intervention now than
they would have been yesterday, and it looks like active types
are looking to sell upticks,"" he added.
 The euro hit a 2011 high of $1.40534 on EBS after solid
demand at a Spanish bond auction and on the view that euro zone
interest rates were likely to rise soon. It was last up 0.9
percent at $1.4024.
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.8852 Swiss francs
before bouncing back above 0.90 francs. While the Swiss central
bank kept interest rates steady, the franc got a bid from
investors who see it as a safe port in a storm.

 * Harsh French stance could hurt grain exports in future
 
 By Valerie Parent
 PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - A major French grain exporter
said on Thursday trade with Libya had completely stopped despite
the country's need to purchase food commodities.
 Loic Desselas, head of trading at Soufflet, a French grain
trading company which counts Libya as a client, said that
France's harsh political stance could hurt future exports if
Muammar Gaddafi stays in power.
 Oil-rich Libya imports large quantities of grain. 
 A French political source said on Thursday France believed
it could muster enough support for the U.N. Security Council to
pass a resolution on Libya and that military intervention could
take place within hours of that.
 ""I don't know what will happen, but it is possible that this
market will close (for France) for political reasons,"" Desselas
said at a conference organised by grain lobby France Export
Cereales.
 Libya's Defence Ministry said on Thursday any foreign attack
would endanger air and maritime traffic in the Mediterranean
basin and expose the area to both short- and long-term risks.
 ""Today not a single shipping company wants to go there,""
Desselas told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.
 ""They (Libyans) want to buy, but no one wants to go there.
In the short term we are in a total dead-end, the country is as
if it were at war,"" he added.
 Prior to the crisis, an official said the country expected
to import 1.3 million tonnes of wheat in 2011.
 France, which exported 144,500 tonnes of wheat in 2009-2010
to Libya, so far has exported this marketing season around
227,000 tonnes of soft wheat, according to Reuters data.

 Desselas said Soufflet had been forced to reroute wheat and
barley shipments to Morocco, Turkey and Lebanon since the unrest
started. He declined to give details on volumes.
 Sources at the end of last month said two consignments for a
total of 17,500 tonnes of French barley were diverted from Libya
to Lebanon.

interim duties worth up to 73 percent on imports of Chinese-made
ceramic tiles, counteracting what the bloc says is illegal
dumping by Chinese producers.
 The duties will hit some 275 million euros ($385.3 million)
of ceramic bathroom, kitchen and paving tiles the EU says China
exports to Europe per year at artificially low prices, hurting
producers based largely in Italy, Spain and Portugal.
 ""The investigation showed that the (European) Union industry
is suffering material injury because of the effects of dumped
imports which undercut its prices,"" the bloc said in its
official register.
 Thursday's duty imposition adds to a slew of defensive trade
barriers the EU is throwing up to ward off what it says is
unfair competition from low-cost exporters largely based in
Asia.
 The EU is the world's biggest ceramic tiles producer after
China with an annual turnover of about 9 billion euros, but
profit margins have been falling due to Chinese competition,
according to the European Ceramic Tile Manufacturers'
Federation, which requested the duties.
 The duties can stay in place for six months while the EU
executive Commission considers whether to impose definitive
duties, which would be valid for five years.
 Importers have said they will be able to find alternative
sources of cheap tiles.

 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Terril Jones	
 TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japanese engineers toiled
frantically to avert a catastrophic release of radiation from a
crippled nuclear power plant north of Tokyo on Friday, but the
United States said it could take weeks to cool the facility's
overheating fuel rods.	
 Officials said they hoped to fix a power cable to at least
two of the six reactors in the hope of restarting water pumps
and were preparing to douse them in the afternoon with water
from fire trucks.	
 However, no one was holding out hope that the crisis --
about to enter its second week after last Friday's 9.0-magnitude
earthquake and tsunami -- could be overcome anytime soon. 
 Japan's nuclear agency spokesman conceded that a ""Chernobyl
solution"" of burying the reactors in sand and concrete was in
the back of the authorities' minds.	
 Millions in Tokyo remained indoors on Friday, fearing a
blast of radioactive material from the complex 240 km (150
miles) to the north, though prevailing winds would likely carry
contaminated smoke or steam away from the densely populated city
to dissipate over the Pacific Ocean.	
 Japan's nuclear disaster, the world's worst since Chernobyl
in Ukraine 25 years ago, has triggered alarm and reviews of
safety at atomic power plants around the globe. 
 U.S. President Barack Obama, who stressed the United States
did not expect harmful radiation to reach its shores, announced
that he had ordered a comprehensive review of domestic nuclear
plants and pledged Washington's support for Japan. 
 ""In the coming days, we will continue to do everything we
can to ensure the safety of American citizens and the security
of our sources of energy,"" he said. ""And we will stand with the
people of Japan as they contain this crisis, recover from this
hardship, and rebuild their great nation."" 
 The Group of Seven rich nations, stepping in together to
calm global financial markets after a tumultuous week, agreed to
join in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen. 


 The United States' top nuclear regulator said it could take
weeks to reverse the overheating of fuel rods at the Fukushima
Daiichi plant.	
 ""This is something that will take some time to work through,
possibly weeks, as you eventually remove the majority of the
heat from the reactors and then the spent-fuel pools,"" Nuclear
Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko told a news
conference at the White House.	
 Yukiya Amano, head of the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), was due back in his homeland later on
Friday with an international team of experts after earlier
complaining about a lack of information from Japan.	
 Graham Andrew, his senior aide, called the situation at the
plant ""reasonably stable "" but the government said
white smoke or steam was still rising from three reactors and
helicopters used to dump water on the plant had shown exposure
to small amounts of radiation.	
 ""The situation remains very serious, but there has been no
significant worsening since yesterday,"" Andrew said.	
 The nuclear agency said the radiation level at the plant was
as high as 20 millisieverts per hour. The limit for the workers
was 100 per hour.	
 
 COOLING PUMPS MAY NOT WORK	
 Even if the engineers manage to connect the power at the
Fukushima Daiichi plant, it is not clear the pumps will work as
they may have been damaged in the earthquake or subsequent
explosions and there are real fears of the electricity shorting
and causing another explosion.	
 Nuclear agency spokesman Hidehiko Nishiyama said it was
unclear how effective spraying water on the reactors from
helicopters had been on Thursday, but the priority now was to
get water into the spent-fuel pools. 
 ""We have to reduce the heat somehow and may use seawater,""
he told a news conference. ""We need to get the reactors back
online as soon as possible and that's why we're trying to
restore power to them.""	
 Jaczko said the cooling pool for spent-fuel rods at the
complex's reactor No.4 may have run dry and another was leaking.

 DOLLAR GAINS AS FINANCIAL LEADERS INTERVENE	
 The U.S. dollar surged more than two yen to 81.80
after the G7's pledge to intervene, leaving behind a record low
of 76.25 hit on Thursday. 
 Japan's Nikkei share index climbed 3.0 percent,
recouping some of the week's stinging losses. 
 U.S. markets, which had tanked earlier in the week on the
back of the crisis, rebounded on Thursday but investors were not
convinced the advance would last. 
 The yen has seen steady buying since the earthquake, as
Japanese and international investors closed long positions in
higher-yielding, riskier assets such as the Australian dollar,
funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency.	
 Expectations that Japanese insurers and companies would
repatriate billions of dollars in overseas funds to pay for a
reconstruction bill that is expected to be much costlier than
the one that followed the Kobe earthquake in 1995 also have
helped boost the yen. 
 
 RADIATION LEVELS IN TOKYO BARELY ABOVE AVERAGE	
 The government had warned Tokyo's 13 million residents on
Thursday to prepare for a possible large-scale blackout but
later said there was no need for one. Still, many firms
voluntarily reduced power, submerging parts of the usually
neon-lit city in darkness.	
 The U.S. embassy in Tokyo has urged citizens living within
80 km (50 miles) of the Daiichi plant to evacuate or remain
indoors ""as a precaution"", while Britain's foreign office urged
citizens ""to consider leaving the area"". Other nations have
urged nationals in Japan to leave the country or head south.	
 Japan's government has told everyone living within 20 km (12
miles) of the plant to evacuate, and advised people within 30 km
(18 miles) to stay indoors.	
 At its worst, radiation in Tokyo has reached 0.809
microsieverts per hour this week, 10 times below what a person
would receive if exposed to a dental x-ray. On Thursday,
radiation levels were barely above average. 
 The plight of hundreds of thousands left homeless by the
earthquake and tsunami worsened following a cold snap that
brought heavy snow to worst-affected areas.	
 Supplies of water and heating oil are low at evacuation
centres, where many survivors wait bundled in blankets.	
 About 30,000 households in the north were still
without electricity in near-freezing weather, Tohuku Electric
Power Co. said, and the government said at least 1.6 million
households lacked running water. 
 The National Police Agency said on Friday it had confirmed
5,692 deaths from the quake and tsunami disaster, while 9,522
people were unaccounted for in six prefectures.

 * Merkel to accelerate shift from nuclear energy
 * Italy seeks ""pause to reflect"" on nuclear plans
 
 By David Stamp and Stephen Jewkes
 BERLIN/ROME, March 17 (Reuters) - Japan's nuclear crisis
spurred German Chancellor Angela Merkel to pledge a faster shift
from nuclear power on Thursday and seemed to thwart Italy's
plans to reintroduce atomic energy.
 Several other European nations, from Finland to Switzerland,
have turned more sceptical about nuclear energy after Friday's
earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima plant in the
world's worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster.
 In Berlin, Merkel dismissed allegations that she may have
closed seven atomic plants illegally and told parliament that
nuclear technology remained a transitional source of affordable
power while renewable energy sources were developed further.
 Earlier this week, she backtracked on an unpopular decision
to extend the life of ageing nuclear power stations, drawing
scorn from the opposition which said she was only trying to
avoid a major electoral setback in regional polls this month.
 Under a ""moratorium"" announced on Tuesday, the government
ordered the closure for safety checks of all seven of Germany's
nuclear plants which began operating before 1980 for at least
three months.
 ""We will use the moratorium period, which we deliberately
set to be short and ambitious, to drive the change in energy
policy and accelerate it wherever possible, as we want to reach
the age of renewable energy as quickly as possible,"" she said.
 Merkel backtracked on her government's decision taken only
last autumn to prolong the life of Germany's total of 17 nuclear
power plants beyond their original closure dates.
 In Italy, the government called for time to reflect,
apparently softening plans ahead of a planned June referendum on
reintroducing nuclear power.
 
 ITALIAN PAUSE
 ""From the information we have, the problem in Japan will not
be easy to resolve,"" Industry Minister Paolo Romani told
reporters. ""We should take a pause to reflect and above all, we
cannot make choices which are not shared by everyone.""
 ""I think there is now less than 0.01 percent chance for
nuclear in Italy,"" said Luigi De Paoli, energy economy professor
at the Bocconi University in Milan.
 Italy's worst earthquake since 1980 struck central Italy
around the city of L'Aquila in April 2009, killing more than 300
people and flattening whole towns.
 A poll published earlier this week showed 53 percent of
Italians were now against nuclear plans with only 35 percent in
favour and 12 percent undecided. Polls previously showed the
'No' and 'Yes' camps each attracted roughly 45 percent.
 Many European Union nations have been looking to nuclear
power to meet ambitious goals for fighting global warming.
Nuclear and renewable energies are responsible for a fraction of
the emissions of fossil fuels.
 In Jerusalem, Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was reconsidering plans to build a nuclear power plant
in Israel in the wake of the crisis in Japan.
 Netanyahu made the announcement in an interview to be aired
later on Thursday on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, according to a
Twitter announcement by the show's executive producer.
 Israel last year began a study to determine the best way to
construct the country's first nuclear power plant, with a target
date of 2025. Israel now has two reactors, including a secretive
facility believed to have produced nuclear weapons.
 In Poland, unease was growing among Poles living near the
probable site of their country's first atomic power plant after
Japan's disaster but the Polish government is adamant that
nuclear power is safe and remains the best option.
 ""There is a fear that what happened in Japan could happen
here. We would be closest to it so we would have the problems,""
said Paulina Krypina, a young mother and resident of Zarnowiec
which is a likely site of one of two plants.
 In Turkey, environmental group Greenpeace said the country
should abandon plans to launch nuclear power plants because it
was close to geological fault lines.
 Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday said plans for a
Russian-built plant on Turkey's Mediterranean coast and a second
one for its Black Sea coast, which is under discussion with
Tokyo Electric Power Co and Toshiba, won't be affected by the
risk of a natural disaster like Japan's quake.
 The Czech Repubic said it saw no reason for safety checks at
its two nuclear plants. Dana Drabova, head of the nuclear safety
office, said it seemed premature to make ""hasty decisions when
we hardly know what happened"" at Fukushima.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2011 12:24PM ET</span>",AFRICA MONEY-Pressure on naira tests Nigerian central bank," * Firms take long dollar positions ahead of April polls
 * But central bank appears determined to support naira
 * To start selling forex forwards next week
 * Bond yields rise at auction amid fiscal concerns
 * But foreign reserves stabilising due to high oil price
 
 By Chijioke Ohuocha
 LAGOS, March 17 (Reuters) - The Nigerian central bank looks
set to win a showdown with the foreign exchange market as it
resists pressure for major depreciation of the naira ahead of
national elections.
 Businesses and rich Nigerians are going long on dollars to
hedge against the risk of any prolonged political upheaval or
security problems due to the April 9 presidential vote, in which
President Goodluck Jonathan faces a determined challenge from
his main rival, ex-military ruler Muhammadu Buhari.
 A downtrend in Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves has added
to the market's jitters. The International Monetary Fund warned
last month that the naira could become subject to ""intense
speculation"" if the reserves continued to fall, and recommended
greater exchange rate flexibility. [ID:nLDE71G1O1]
 But central bank governor Lamido Sanusi, who has won
international praise for his clean-up of Nigeria's debt-ridden
banking system, insists the naira is flexible enough.
 He has repeatedly said a stable exchange rate is key to
maintaining investor confidence, and told Reuters two weeks ago
that devaluing the naira would increase Nigeria's import bill
and fuel inflation.
 Some clever maneouvering by the central bank in the market,
and a recent improvement in the foreign exchange reserves, now
suggest it will probably succeed in keeping the naira 
in a corridor of plus or minus 3 percent around 150 to the
dollar, as it has been doing for over a year.
 ""We remain confident in the sustainability of the 150 level
despite the current naira weakness, notably given the country's
favourable external fundamentals, the tightening in monetary
conditions and, to a lesser extent...the nearly flat spending
outlook implied by this year's budget,"" said Samir Gadio,
emerging markets strategist at Standard Bank.
 
 WEAKNESS
 The naira edged down to trade around 156.90 against the
dollar on Thursday, its lowest level in about 18 months,
compared to 155.10 at the start of the week and 153.40 around
two weeks ago. [ID:LDE72E25A]
 Dollar supplies from the central bank at its bi-weekly
auctions have slowed the decline but have not been large enough
to halt it. Traders say strong dollar demand from companies with
unconfirmed letters of credit, payments on foreign credit cards
and large foreign exchange purchases by bureaux de change are
eating up dollar supplies in the interbank market.
 ""I see the naira going up to 158 depending on whether the
central bank is willing to defend it,"" said a treasury executive
at a multinational consumer goods firm.
 The executive said a rate of 160 would affect his company's
operations. ""Anything above 155 naira would be a worry and
anything above 160 naira, we would have to put contingency
measures in place like forward contracts,"" he said.
 ""Any increase in forex charges would be added to our bottom
line and reduce our profits, and it's got the potential to
increase our prices and affect our operations.""
 A senior commercial banker, noting the shallowness of the
foreign exchange market meant a single large deal could shift
the rate significantly, said Nigeria's reserves were a concern.
Their decline over the past year, despite rising oil prices, has
raised questions among some analysts about the quality of the
government's economic management.
 ""Reserves of $37 billion would not anchor the currency in
the event of a concerted market drive against the naira,"" the
banker said.
 Fiscal policy is another concern for investors. The Senate
on Wednesday passed a 4.972 trillion naira ($32 billion) 2011
budget, increasing spending plans from Jonathan's initial
proposal three months ago. Over half of the planned spending is
recurrent, meaning Nigeria is spending more on keeping
government running than on badly needed new infrastructure and
development projects. [ID:nLDE72F229]
 A Nigerian government bond auction on Thursday suggested
some investor disquiet about fiscal policy and the currency.
Five-year paper was sold at a marginal rate of 12 percent, up
from 11 percent last month, and three-year paper at 10.50
percent against 9.25 percent. [ID:nLDE72G1F4]
 
 SUPPORT
 Nevertheless, the treasury executive at the multinational,
and many analysts, said they expected the naira to recover to
normal levels after next month's elections to the presidency,
parliament and state governorships.
 Nigeria only emerged from military rule just over a decade
ago, and all of its elections since then have been marred by
rigging and intimidation. But this has not seriously threatened
stability at a national level and Jonathan remains the favourite
to win, though the opposition is hoping to force a run-off vote.
 Recently there has been good news on the foreign reserves;
they rebounded to $36.4 billion on March 8, up 10 percent from
the end of February, though they remained well down from $42
billion a year ago, according to the central bank.
 The government has attributed reserves' decline in the past
year to counter-cyclical spending during an economic downturn,
the defence of the naira, seed capital for a planned sovereign
wealth fund, and financing for infrastructure projects.
 Those explanations do not fully satisfy everyone, but
authorities insist that with oil output and prices rising,
reserves will build up once again.
 And the central bank has taken some clever administrative
steps to reduce pressure on the naira. It has asked banks buying
foreign exchange at its auctions to submit lists of customers
for which the purchases are occurring, to verify the demand is
for commerce rather than for speculation.
 It also plans to start selling short-tenored forex forward
contracts from next Wednesday as part of efforts to smooth
demand and help businesses hedge their currency risk. This could
reduce the threat of panicky sales of naira. [ID:nLDE710265]
 Razia Khan, economist for Africa at Standard Chartered Bank,
said the current naira corridor might conceivably be shifted,
but only carefully and gradually.
 ""We all believe that the mid-point is around 150 but there
is nothing to stop the central bank adjusting it up gradually in
response to high demand...and then maybe allowing it to go down
again when conditions allow.
 ""Do we think that they are about to announce a big
devaluation in the naira? No. But do we think the recently
announced spending plans are going to create more pressure on
the currency? Yes.""

Thursday that the United States would help Ireland recover from
its economic problems and that he would visit in May.
 ""We have had an excellent conversation about how Ireland is

economic front,"" Obama said.
 He said the the two men discussed the fact that the
situation in Northern Ireland continued to be stable.
 ""We are going to continue to pursue all the progress that's
been made there,"" the president said.
 Kenny, at the White House on St. Patrick's Day, said
Obama's planned visit was a statement of confidence in his

226,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2011 12:16PM ET</span>","FOREX-Market on BOJ alert, yen retreats from record high"," * Traders on alert for intervention to weaken the yen
 * G7 to meet around 6 p.m. (2200 GMT) on market turmoil
 * Swiss franc buoyed, near record high vs dollar
(Updates prices, adds detail, comment)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Fear that Japan may soon
intervene to weaken the yen after it hit a record high against
the dollar left currency traders skittish on Thursday, and the
market may start trimming yen longs as a G7 meeting nears.
 The dollar hit a record low of 76.25 yen as Asian trading
began after a break of 79.75 triggered a cascade of automatic
""sell"" orders. The dollar bounced back to 78.90 yen and has
remained in a fairly tight range.
 ""Everyone is on the lookout for intervention after
yesterday's volatility,"" said Greg Anderson, strategist at
Citigroup. ""Anybody who was long this week is out of the
market, and the shorts are out too. People are in wait-and-see
mode for the G7.""
 Finance officials of the Group of Seven countries will
discuss steps to calm markets. A Dow Jones news report quoted
an unnamed source as saying Japan's ministry was ""ready for
battle"" on the yen.
 C.J. Gavsie, director of FX sales at BMO Capital markets,
said ""the market's jittery, liquidity is a concern and we think
some sort of intervention from Japanese authorities is likely
in some shape or form.""
 The dollar rebound was driven partly by Japanese importers
and some retail margin traders. The latter were cited as a main
factor behind the earlier plunge, with the speed of the decline
-- the dollar shed more than three yen in about 20 minutes --
forcing them to dump trades financed with borrowed yen.
 The yen has been strengthening since last week's earthquake
hit Japan, with traders bracing for investors to start bringing
money home to pay for reconstruction.
 The yen also rose against the Korean and Chinese
currencies. Analysts said that is especially worrisome for
Tokyo because it undermines Japan's trade competitiveness
relative to its Asian neighbors.
 The G7 is set to meet around 6 p.m. (2200 GMT), and traders
said the market may start trimming lingering yen longs shortly
before that, which could push the dollar toward its session
peak around 79.74 yen.
 But absent intervention, there's little to stand in the way
of further yen gains, said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche Bank's global
head of G10 currency strategy.
 ""The Japanese probably did themselves a bad turn when it
comes to credibility"" by not stepping in sooner, Ruskin said.
 ""People may be more inclined to fight intervention now than
they would have been yesterday, and it looks like active types
are looking to sell upticks,"" he added.
 The cost of hedging against a further yen rise jumped, with
implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen trading close to 20
percent, though still below levels seen at the peak of the 2008
global financial crisis.
 Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, blamed
speculation for the yen spike and said he was closely watching
markets, a warning that authorities may soon buy dollars.
 Some analysts said intervention may be more effective this
time than it was in September when Japan spent $26 billion to
weaken the yen but failed to ensure a lasting dollar rally.
 ""This entire move can be pinned down to speculative
positioning rather than any repatriation flows,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. ""Since
it is speculative, intervention in this case should work and
clear out some of the long yen positions.""
 EURO, SWISS FRANC RISE
 Elsewhere, the euro hit a 2011 high of $1.4052 after solid
demand at a Spanish bond auction and on the view that euro zone
interest rates were likely to rise soon. It was last up 0.9
percent at $1.4015.
 The dollar also fell to a record low of 0.8852 Swiss francs
before bouncing back above 0.90 francs. While the Swiss central
bank kept interest rates steady, the franc got a bid from
investors who see it as a safe port in a storm.

 ST PETERSBURG/MOSCOW, March 17 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil
is in advanced discussions with Russia's independent gas

its Arctic gas project, sources told Reuters.
 ""They are in intensive discussions,"" one source close to
Novatek shareholders told Reuters on Thursday.
 Last week French major Total 
 Novatek declined comment, and Statoil said it does not
comment on speculations about concrete initiatives.
 Novatek's deal making with experienced western gas producers
comes less than a year after its head, Leonid Mikhelson said the
company could make do on its own.
 It also underscores Russia's rising importance for foreign
oil and gas majors looking to gain early access to Russia's
giant, untapped offshore reserves. Earlier this year BP and
ExxonMobil struck offshore deals with state-owned oil firm
Rosneft to explore for oil in the Arctic.
 Both Total and Statoil are partners with Russia's largest
gas producer Gazprom in the Arctic offshore Shtokman project
that the Russian government is discussing delaying until 2018..
 A source within Novatek said Statoil was a top candidate for
partnership because of its experience in working in similar
challenging climatic conditions in Norway and could help with
building the LNG plant.
 ""In this case, it's of course Statoil ... They work in
similar conditions there,"" he said.
 Statoil's shares were up 2.84 percent by 1520 GMT.

 By Leika Kihara and Daniel Flynn
 TOKYO/PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - Japan dismissed the need
for joint action to curb the soaring yen ahead of a conference
call of G7 finance ministers and sources said the group of rich
nations was more likely to offer general pledges of solidarity
as Tokyo struggles to contain a nuclear crisis.
 Rising alarm over the unfolding disaster in the world's
third largest economy has sent shudders through world markets,
hitting shares and commodities, while pushing investors towards
the safe haven of government debt.
 The yen soared overnight to a record high against the dollar
amid speculation Japanese firms would repatriate billions of
dollars in overseas funds to pay for a reconstruction bill that
is expected to be much costlier than the one that followed the
Kobe earthquake in 1995.
 A strong yen could make it more difficult for the heavily
export-dependent Japanese economy to recover from the triple
blow of last week's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear threat.
 But Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano told Reuters
that neither currency nor stock markets were in a state of
turmoil that would warrant G7 action and said Tokyo was more
interested in ""psychological support"" from its partners.
 Sources from G7 countries who requested anonymity, also said
the call, which is expected to take place around 2200 GMT and
include both finance ministers and central bank chiefs, was
unlikely to result in concrete decisions.
 ""It's a demonstration of solidarity and a general review of
the situation,"" one source said.
 Still, analysts said the chances of coordinated intervention
in the foreign exchange market remained high and predicted that
other G7 countries were unlikely to oppose selling of the yen if
Tokyo decided to press ahead.
 The IMF declined to comment on the yen's rise and voiced
confidence that the government in Tokyo could cope.
 ""We believe the Japanese economy is a strong and wealthy
society and the government has financial resources to address
(its) needs,"" IMF spokeswoman Caroline Atkinson told a regular
news briefing in Washington.
 U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters that he would
make a statement on Japan later in the day.
 
 HEIGHTENED ANXIETY
 Japanese military helicopters and fire trucks doused an
overheating nuclear plant in the northeast of the country with
water on Thursday to try to limit the damage from the world's
worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986.
 The G7 call and Obama's statement suggest a heightened
degree of concern among top policymakers at the threat posed by
the disaster at a time when the global economy is still
recovering from its worst downturn in nearly 80 years.
 Europe is still wrestling with a crippling debt crisis and
the U.S. Federal Reserve is buying up domestic government debt
to safeguard a stop-start economic bounceback there.
 ""I think the world economy is going to go right down and it
has happened at a time when financial markets are still
fragile,"" said a central banker of a G7 country who declined to
be named.
 Japan's triple disaster, unprecedented in a major developed
economy, is already disrupting global manufacturing.
 Makers of equipment for mobile telephones to carmakers and
chipmakers have warned of a squeeze on their businesses given
Japan's crucial role in many supply chains that keep global
commerce ticking over.
 The technology sector felt an immediate impact after
Friday's quake and tsunami since Japan makes around a fifth of
the world's semiconductors.
 On Thursday, electronic conglomerate Toshiba Corp said an
assembly line that makes LCD displays for smartphones and other
devices would be shut for a month to repair machinery damaged by
the quake.
 The company's shares are already reeling on speculation its
nuclear power business will suffer after governments globally
have raised doubts about the industry's future.
 China suspended approvals for new nuclear plants on
Wednesday, effectively putting on hold the world's most
ambitious expansion plan.
 
 ""IT'S MAYHEM OUT THERE""
 Economists fear an extended slump for the world's
third-biggest economy with a recession possibly lasting two or
three quarters. The costs from the disaster are expected to
reach up to $200 billion.
 ""The economic cost of the disaster will be large,""
economists at JP Morgan said. ""There has been substantial loss
of economic resources and economic activity will be impeded by
infrastructural damages in the weeks and months ahead.""
 The effect on global growth may be more limited. BNP Paribas
estimates the disaster will shave 3 percent from Japan's
projected GDP this year. That would account for just 0.2 percent
of world output.
 But G7 financial leaders may be worried that a surge in yen
repatriation could unsettle global markets, creating a crisis of
confidence that spreads from Asia to Europe and the United
States.
 The yen soared to a record high of 76.25 per dollar, flying
past its historical peak of 79.75, hit in the aftermath of the
Kobe earthquake. The yen later back tracked to just below 79 per
dollar.
 ""It's mayhem out there,"" said a trader at an Australian bank
in Sydney. ""The yen's been moving a big figure a second on
occasions. A lot of people are crying out for the central banks
to step in.""

 NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - European and U.S. stocks
rebounded from three days of exhaustive selling on Thursday
even as Japan's nuclear power crisis continued, while the yen
traded near a record high against the dollar.
 Markets speculated that Japanese investors would sell
overseas assets to bring home funds. The yen hit a record high
against the dollar of 76.25 yen  as Asian markets began
trading.
 Group of Seven finance leaders and central bankers were to
discuss steps to calm markets later on Thursday, and currency
traders have interpreted some remarks as indicating other
central banks may give Japan their blessing to intervene to
drive the dollar higher against the yen. [ID:nLDE72G10U]
 Developments at Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant remained a
main source of worry for investors. Japanese military
helicopters dumped water, and a water canon was used on an
overheating nuclear reactor, but radiation levels at the plant
remained high. For details, see [ID:nL3E7EH18S]
 ""The absence of immediately worse news from Japan is
interpreted by equity traders as a reason to stop selling and
look for buying opportunities,"" Jim Vogel, an interest rate
strategist at FTN Financial, said in a note.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1.5
percent, after hitting a three-month low earlier in the week.
After hitting 30-month highs in mid-February, the index has now
erased all of this year's gains.
 Tokyo stocks ended down 1.4 percent <.N225>, coming off an
intraday low as a more than 14 percent drop since March 10
attracted buyers. Earlier this week, Japanese stocks suffered
their worst two-day selloff since 1987.
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> gained
0.9 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 1.9
percent as a recent sell-off attracted bargain hunters.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> jumped 159.62

 The index known as Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX,
<.VIX>, fell 13 percent to 25.69 on Thursday, a day after
hitting its highest level since July.
 Some traders, however, said there were still reasons to be
cautious.
 ""The drop has been violent, but the newsflow remains very
alarming,"" said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales
trading at Global Equities in Paris. ""There is short covering
at this point, and we continue to see outflows.
 ""Stocks might look oversold on the short term, but they are
not if we're heading into a bear market. The Japanese crisis
could have severe consequences for the global economy,"" he
said.
 Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> fell 0.3 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  rose 2.6 percent to $100.50 a barrel
as unrest in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Libya heightened supply
disruption concerns and investors weighed the impact on energy
demand from quake-hit Japan.
 The state-owned Bahrain Petroleum Co has partly shut down
production due to staff shortages caused by political unrest in
Bahrain, trade sources said. Bahrain arrested at least six
opposition leaders, a day after its crackdown on protests by
the Shi'ite Muslim majority raised fears of a regional
conflict. [ID:nLDE72F2Q5][ID:nLDE72G110]
 INTERVENTION THREAT
 In New York, the yen traded at around 78.67 per dollar, off
the earlier record high that traders fear could trigger
intervention by Japan.
Japanese margin traders were cited as one of the main
factors behind the dollar's fall against the yen, as the break

230,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2011 11:48AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Yen surge raises FX intervention risks," (Recasts, updates, adds details and graphic)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Japan is expected to step into
the currency markets to curb the yen's surge to record highs
against the dollar and has a better chance of success if it wins
the blessing of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
 G7 finance chiefs will hold a teleconference at 2200 GMT on
Thursday and the foreign exchanges are abuzz with speculation
that the meeting will address a sharp overnight surge in the yen
that Japan has blamed on speculators.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to comment
on the possibility of currency intervention but said authorities
were closely monitoring the market moves.
 Still, Japan's insistence that the surge in the yen seen
since last week's earthquake in Japan is driven by speculation
-- and the dearth of evidence to show Japanese capital
repatriation is behind the move -- is prompting traders to brace
themselves for sharper rhetoric and intervention.
 ""If Noda is to be believed, i.e. that sharp yen gains are
due to speculators rather than repatriation flows, then markets
can be categorised as near disorderly,"" said Tom Levinson,
currency strategist at ING.
 ""If so, coordinated G7 intervention to sell yen is very
likely -- this has not occurred since G7 bought euros in 2000.
At this time, there is unlikely to be significant G7 opposition
to such action, despite Noda's claim that he only wants
psychological support from the G7.""
 The dollar slid to a record low of 76.25 yen in early Asian
trade on Thursday, accumulating losses of 8.4 percent since the
earthquake. 
 While it recovered to 78.76 yen, investors like model funds
are adding to long yen positions, making it possible that the
yen will set new record highs in the coming days or weeks.
 Traders said the speed of the yen's move -- the dollar shed
more than three yen in some 20 minutes -- triggered margin calls
for Japanese retail investors who had funded trades with
cheaply-borrowed yen. 
 Moreover the sharp volatility seen in the currency markets
was not mirrored in bond or stock markets, giving ammunition to
those who are arguing that the yen moves are disorderly.
 Disorderly moves are frowned upon by G7 policymakers, whose
finance chiefs regularly point out that they are prepared to act
against them.
 Moreover, a stronger yen risks compounding Japan's economic
troubles as it struggles to contain a worsening nuclear crisis.
 This meant it was only a matter of time before Japan resumed
intervention of the sort last seen in September, analysts said.
 Japan launched a record one-day, $26 billion bout of
dollar-buying intervention in September when a stronger currency
was undermining the stock market and threatening to worsen
deflation. The dollar rose from around 83 yen to nearly 86 yen.
 
 COORDINATED ACTION
 At that time, Japan intervened alone as the United States
was grappling with prospects of a double-dip recession and
paving the way for more quantitative easing while Europe was
tackling the sovereign debt crisis. In fact, European
policymakers were opposed to any joint intervention.
 This time around, there seems near unanimity that there has
been excess volatility in the past few days.
 ""The focus for the yen over the next 48 hours is what the G7
will do,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe
Generale. 
 ""The right outcome for Japan is not to have a strong
currency, but monetary easing. It makes sense for the G7 to
coordinate input for a weaker currency.""
 While there may be questions whether the dollar's fall from
83 yen to 80 was excessive, there is unlikely to be disagreement
about the move down from 80 yen to 76 yen, analysts say. 
 While the dollar was falling, liquidity evaporated and
offers to buy were pulled, leaving huge gaps in the charts.
 This was also reflected in the derivatives market.
 Implied volatility, a measure of how much the market thinks
a currency will move, jumped across different time horizons. The
one-month implied volatility leapt to 18.5 percent, from around
13 percent in an hour as dollar/yen slumped.
 ""If we see further bouts of extreme volatility then the Bank
of Japan would be well served to step in simply to calm nerves,""
Westpac analysts said.
 Analysts say that in addition to selling yen in the spot
market, G7 officials could establish emergency lines to provide
yen liquidity like the lines that were established in 2009 and
2010 which provided dollars to banks outside the United States.

 * Minority govt says ready to negotiate, substitute measures
 * President seen mediating to prevent crisis

(Recasts, adds government position, analyst comments)
 By Andrei Khalip
 LISBON, March 17 (Reuters) - Portugal's main opposition
Social Democrats (PSD) told the minority government on Thursday
to modify its latest austerity measures to avoid a political
crisis as they would not back the existing plan in parliament.
 The government said it was ready to negotiate to prevent a
political standoff that would exacerbate the country's debt woes
and would consider substituting some measures for those proposed
by the opposition as long as they help to cut the budget gap.
 The Socialist government warns that refusal by the PSD to
support the latest measures would spark a crisis which could
force the country to seek a bailout like Ireland and Greece,
something it has staunchly resisted.
 PSD leader Pedro Passos Coelho told journalists after
meeting President Anibal Cavaco Silva it was not too late for
the government to come up with different proposals, especially
on pension cuts.
 ""The PSD cannot give its approval to the measures ... I told
the president of the PSD's firm and irreversible position on
that matter,"" Passos Coelho said.
 ""We expect that the government knows how to and will change
the path so as to not penalise the most unprotected, especially
the pensioners,"" he added in what appeared to be a more moderate
stance than his earlier blunt rejection of the measures.
 The government's latest measures were announced last week
as Portugal's risk premiums hit euro lifetime highs and included
cuts in spending on infrastructure and social welfare plus a
special levy that would effectively reduce some pensions,
equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP.
 
 GOVERNMENT OPEN TO NEGOTIATION
 Cabinet Minister Pedro Silva Pereira told reporters a
stalemate would undermine the country's financing capacity and
had to be prevented at all costs.
 ""The government is totally available to negotiate ... its
position is not irreversible,"" he said.
 ""What is at stake is too serious for us to not apply all
possible efforts to save the country from a political crisis ...
We are here to discuss the measures, all the measures, as long
as they meet the requirements of the budget consolidation and
can convince investors,"" he said.
 The president, who often acts as a mediator, was due to meet
Prime Minister Jose Socrates on Friday, when the premier will
also take part in a parliament debate.
 The Socialists rule in a minority and need to negotiate
support for legislation in parliament. The PSD has previously
allowed the passage of the government's austerity measures. 
 The government has already implemented tough austerity
measures, including cutting public sector wages and raising
taxes.
 The latest cuts are aimed at helping the country meet its
promise to cut the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP this
year from around 7 percent last year.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates and his government officials
challenged the opposition to come up with alternative solutions
to guarantee that Portugal meets its budget deficit targets,
which they said they were ready to discuss.
 ""The president must have advised the PSD leader to have a
more prudent attitude and not just refuse any dialogue,"" said
Viriato Soromenho Marques, a political analyst at the University
of Lisbon. ""It's not the time to flex muscles. A political
crisis would have very grave consequences."" 
 He said the government had brought the problem on itself by
presenting the measures without consulting first with the PSD as
its ally on austerity, but the PSD's stance has been ""immature"".
 Still, he said most of the measures were not designed to be
imposed immediately and there was time to discuss and modify
them, if the sides overcome the bad blood between them.
 ""It's time for prudence, let's see if the government and the
PSD can act responsibly,"" he added.
 The premium investors demand to hold Portugal's benchmark
10-year bond yields rather than German Bunds rose to 461 basis
points on Thursday from 457 on Wednesday.

 LONDON/NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - European and U.S.
stocks rebounded from three days of exhaustive selling on
Thursday even as Japan's nuclear power crisis continued, while
the yen rose but backtracked from a record high.
 Markets speculated that Japanese investors would sell

central banks would intervene to stop the rise that could
further damage Japan's economy.
 Developments at Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant remained a
main source of worry for investors. Japanese military
helicopters dumped water and a water canon was also used on an
overheating nuclear reactor, but radiation levels at the plant

(Adds detail on duties, quote, background)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, March 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission has
proposed a five-year import tariff worth up to 39.1 percent on
imports of coated fine paper from China, according to a document
obtained by Reuters on Thursday.
 The tariff, which needs the approval of European Union
member states and must launch by May 17, aims to counteract what
the EU executive says are illegal Chinese state subsidies and
market dumping by Chinese exporters.
 Combining for the first time anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
duties against China, the duty plan is politically sensitive and
expected to be discussed by representatives of EU member states
later this month.
 In itself a small case -- Europe imported about 130 million
euros of Chinese coated fine paper in 2009 for use in brochures
and coffee-table books -- the EU challenge has the potential to
trigger similar moves in other sectors.
 Other industries under pressure to compete with Chinese
rivals are keen to challenge what EU policymakers have said is a
rampant network of subsidy schemes in China.
 China has denied it hands out illegal subsidies to industry.
Last week, the World Trade Organization dealt China an important
victory, ruling that the United States had broken trade law by
penalising China twice with dual antidumping and anti-subsidy
duties on certain Chinese goods.
 But the Commission said in its document its dual-tariff plan
would stand up to legal scrutiny and that a combination of the
kind of Chinese subsidies challenged and EU trade laws meant it
would not fall into a trap of imposing illegal double penalties
on Chinese exporters.
 ""It was not considered necessary to further examine whether,
and to what degree, the same subsidies are being offset twice
when antidumping and countervailing duties are simultaneously
imposed on the same product,"" the Commission said in the
document.
 Commission officials were not immediately available for
comment.
 The Chinese operations of Indonesia's Asia Pulp and Paper
(APP) face a combined tariff of 20 percent -- 8 percent to
counteract market dumping and 12 percent to counteract Chinese
state subsidies -- according to the document.
 If approved by a majority of member states, the dual tariff
could be in place until 2016.
 Chinese glossy paper has been subject to a provisional
antidumping duty of up to 39.1 percent since last November.

 * Analysts believe chance of yen intervention high

(Recasts with Yosano comments, G7 sources, quotes)
 By Leika Kihara and Daniel Flynn
 TOKYO/PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - Japan dismissed the need
for joint action to curb the soaring yen ahead of a G7 call on
Thursday and sources from the group of rich nations said
ministers would offer general pledges of solidarity as Tokyo
battles to contain a nuclear crisis.
 Rising alarm over the unfolding disaster in Japan has sent
shudders through world markets, hitting shares and commodities,
while pushing investors towards the safe haven of government
debt.
 The yen soared overnight to a record high against the dollar
amid speculation Japanese firms would repatriate billions of
dollars in overseas funds to pay for a reconstruction bill that
is expected to be much costlier than the one that followed the
Kobe earthquake in 1995.
 A strong yen could make it more difficult for the heavily
export-dependent Japanese economy to recover from the triple
blow of last week's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear threat.
 But Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano told Reuters
that neither currency nor stock markets were in a state of
turmoil that would warrant G7 action and said Tokyo was more
interested in ""psychological support"" from its partners.
 A source from a G7 country who requested anonymity, also
said the call, which is expected to take place around 2200 GMT,
was unlikely to result in concrete decisions.
 ""It's a demonstration of solidarity and a general review of
the situation,"" the source said.
 Other G7 sources echoed that assessment of the call
involving finance ministers and central bank chiefs.
 Still, analysts said the chances of coordinated intervention
in the foreign exchange market remained high and predicted that
other G7 countries were unlikely to oppose selling of the yen if
Tokyo decided to press ahead.
 
 HEIGHTENED ANXIETY
 Japanese military helicopters and fire trucks doused an
overheating nuclear plant in the northeast of the country with
water on Thursday to try to limit the damage from the world's
worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986.
 The G7 call suggests a heightened degree of concern among
top policymakers at the threat posed by the disaster at a time
when the global economy is still recovering from its worst
downturn in nearly 80 years.
 Europe is still wrestling with a crippling debt crisis and
the U.S. Federal Reserve is still buying up domestic government
debt to safeguard a stop-start economic bounceback there.
 ""I think the world economy is going to go right down and it
has happened at a time when financial markets are still
fragile,"" said a central banker of a G7 country who declined to
be named.
 Japan's triple disaster, unprecedented in a major developed
economy, is already disrupting global manufacturing.
 Makers of equipment for mobile telephones to carmakers and
chipmakers have warned of a squeeze on their businesses given
Japan's crucial role in many supply chains that keep global
commerce ticking over.
 The technology sector felt an immediate impact after
Friday's quake and tsunami since Japan makes around a fifth of
the world's semiconductors.
 On Thursday, electronic conglomerate Toshiba Corp said an
assembly line that makes LCD displays for smartphones and other
devices would be shut for a month to repair machinery damaged by
the quake.
 The company's shares are already reeling on speculation its
nuclear power business will suffer after governments globally
have raised doubts about the industry's future.
 China suspended approvals for new nuclear plants on
Wednesday, effectively putting on hold the world's most
ambitious expansion plan.
 
 ""IT'S MAYHEM OUT THERE""
 Economists fear an extended slump for the world's
third-biggest economy with a recession possibly lasting two or
three quarters. The costs from the disaster are expected to
reach up to $200 billion.
 ""The economic cost of the disaster will be large,""
economists at JP Morgan said. ""There has been substantial loss
of economic resources and economic activity will be impeded by
infrastructural damages in the weeks and months ahead.""
 The effect on global growth may be more limited. BNP Paribas
estimates the disaster will shave 3 percent from Japan's
projected GDP this year. That would account for just 0.2 percent
of world output.
 But G7 financial leaders may be worried that a surge in yen
repatriation could unsettle global markets, creating a crisis of
confidence that spreads from Asia to Europe and the United
States.
 The yen soared to a record high of 76.25 per dollar, flying
past its historical peak of 79.75, hit in the aftermath of the
Kobe earthquake. The yen later back tracked to just below 79 per
dollar.
 ""It's mayhem out there,"" said a trader at an Australian bank
in Sydney. ""The yen's been moving a big figure a second on
occasions. A lot of people are crying out for the central banks
to step in.""

 NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - The yen traded near a record
high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, hovering around

weaken the currency through direct market intervention.

said.

 But the source did call the meeting ""a demonstration of

central banks may give Japan their blessing to sell yen
unilaterally and drive the dollar higher.
 ""The G7 discussion is likely to be about pre-approval of
intervention by the Japanese and to some degree what would need
to happen for joint intervention to be necessary,"" said Ray
Farris, strategist at Credit Suisse. ""If dollar/yen lurches
lower again, the Japanese will likely be first to intervene.""
 Japan spent $26 billion in September to weaken the yen, its
first intervention since 2004. A strong currency undermines
Japanese exports, drags down the Nikkei and worsens deflation.
But the yen is stronger now than when Japan last intervened.

 EURO, SWISSIE RISE
 The euro hit a 2011 high of $1.4052  after solid
demand at a Spanish bond auction and on the view that euro zone
interest rates were likely to rise soon. It was last up 0.8
percent at $1.4004.
 The dollar also fell to a record low of 0.8852 Swiss francs
 before bouncing back above 0.90 francs. While the
Swiss central bank kept interest rates steady, the franc got a
bid from investors who see it as a safe port in a storm.
 The yen has been strengthening since last week's earthquake
and radiation leaks from damaged nuclear reactors had traders
bracing for Japanese investors to start bringing money home to
pay for reconstruction.
 Traders said the speed of the move -- the dollar shed more
than three yen in some 20 minutes -- also forced margin calls
for investors who had funded trades with cheaply-borrowed yen.
 ""This entire move can be pinned down to speculative
positioning rather than any repatriation flows and in the near
term there is definitely a risk that this will continue,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
 ""Since it is speculative, intervention in this case should
work and clear out some of the long yen positions,"" he said.
 Japan's finance minister Yoshihiko Noda blamed speculation
for the yen spike and said he was closely watching markets, a
warning that the Bank of Japan may soon be given the signal to
buy dollars. [ID:nL3E7EG3QO]
 The cost of hedging against a further yen rise jumped, with
implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen  trading
close to 20 percent, though still below levels seen at the peak
of the 2008 global financial crisis of around 30 percent.
 The yean rose about six big figures against the Australian
dollar to a six-month high before easing .

 * Further talks planned to try to reach agreement
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, March 17 (Reuters) - European Union governments
and lawmakers remained deadlocked on how to regulate the
production and sale of food from cloned animals, following
all-night talks in Brussels that ended on Thursday morning.
 EU sources said the remaining sticking point was a demand by
lawmakers in the European Parliament for a full EU ban on the
sale of food derived from cloned animals and, crucially, their
offspring.
 EU governments and the bloc's executive support an EU ban on
the use of cloning for food production, and on the import and
sale of food from clones.
 But banning the sale of food derived from the offspring of
cloned animals would be impractical and disrupt global trade, as
meat, milk and processed products from such animals cannot be
distinguished from those produced traditionally, they argued.
 The Parliament's representatives in the negotiations accused
EU governments and the European Commission of intransigence,
saying they had turned a blind eye to the ethical and animal
welfare concerns raised by the use of cloning for food.
 ""It is ... incredible that the Council is willing to turn a
blind eye to public opinion, as well as the ethical and animal
welfare problems associated with cloning,"" EU lawmakers Gianni
Pittella and Kartika Liotard said in a joint statement.
 Under EU procedures, governments and the Parliament have
until the end of March to reach an agreement on the draft
legislation, which regulates the approval and sale of ""novel
foods"" not widely consumed in the EU before 1997.
 A final round of negotiations is scheduled for March 28.
 
 MARKET FOR CLONES
 Animal cloning -- which uses DNA transfer to create an exact
genetic copy of an animal -- currently has a success rate of
below 20 percent, with most cloned animals dying during or
shortly after birth.
 The technique is complex and costly, ensuring that cloned
animals are unlikely to be used directly as food, but they can
be bred traditionally to produce offspring that share similar
traits, such as high milk production or rapid growth.
 The United States is the most advanced country in terms of
animal cloning for food production, with estimates provided by
companies suggesting that ""thousands of cattle"" and ""hundreds of
pigs"" have been cloned there so far.
 The United States currently has a voluntary moratorium on
the marketing of food from cloned animals, but not from their
offspring.
 In August, it emerged that meat from the offspring of a
cloned cow was placed on the market by a dairy farm in Scotland,
leading some British supermarkets to pledge not to sell any meat
from clones or their young.

raising taxes. New measures announced on Friday include cuts in
spending on infrastructure, social welfare and a special levy
that would effectively reduce some pensions.
 The Socialist government has warned that a refusal by the
Social Democrats to support the latest measures could spark a
political crisis, which could force the country to seek a
bailout like Ireland and Greece.
 Still, Prime Minister Jose Socrates and his government
officials challenged the opposition to come up with alternative
solutions to guarantee that Portugal meets its budget deficit
targets, which they said they were ready to discuss.

stabilised a little on Thursday after dinar forwards hit their

small market was almost zero, traders said.
 One-year currency forwards  -- whose rise implies a
weaker currency over the next 12 months -- were quoted at 80/160

Lyndon Loos, head of forex trading for Middle East and North
Africa at Standard Chartered in Dubai.
 ""Today, we have seen very little trading in all six GCC

 The Bahrain central bank said it was operating from its head
office again and all banking services and financial institutions
were functioning normally.
 The forwards, which traders use to bet on future direction
of pegged currencies, now imply that the Bahraini dinar will
depreciate by roughly 0.5 percent from its 0.376 peg to the
dollar over the next year.
 Another trader said there were capital outflows but that it
was difficult to estimate the dinar volumes leaving the country.
 ""There has been no trading at all because of the curfew. The
brokers in Bahrain have not really been in the offices. The
market has been very quiet, and market-making and the two-way
prices have been non-existent,"" the trader said.
 The Bahraini currency market is highly illiquid and traders
sometimes use Saudi riyal forwards as a proxy for the dinar.
 Saudi one-year forwards  were quoted as high as
45/65 points on Thursday, the trader said, adding the situation
in Bahrain could put pressure on other regional currencies such
as the Saudi riyal.
 ""It all depends on how the government treats the Shi'ite
population, because if it gets worse then you will have Shi'ites
elsewhere unhappy and it could spill over to Saudi. That's the
big question mark,"" he said.

 By Martin Dokoupil
 DUBAI, March 16 (Reuters) - Capital flight from Bahrain is
starting to pressure its currency and threaten its position as a
Gulf financial centre, though it looks likely to avoid a
full-blown currency crisis for now.
 The small non-OPEC oil producer, where nearly $10 billion in
mutual funds was parked last year, is the first Arab banking hub
to be hit directly by the political instability sweeping across
the Middle East and North Africa.
 It is struggling to contain its worst unrest since the 1990s
after majority Shi'ite protesters took to the streets, prompting
Saudi Arabia to send in troops in an effort to restore order. As
many as six people were killed on Wednesday. [ID:nLDE72F02J]
 The central bank's tight control over the foreign exchange
market, and the possibility of other Gulf countries providing
financial support to prevent market turmoil from spreading, mean
Bahrain is unlikely for the foreseeable future to have to
abandon the dinar's  peg against the U.S. dollar.
 ""A normal reaction to the ongoing downgrades by credit
rating agencies would be outflow of short-term capital from the
country, but different from other examples, possible financial
helplines from other GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries
are an alleviating factor,"" said Kubilay Ozturk, EMEA economist
at Deutsche Bank in London.
 But bankers said there had been substantial outflows of
funds from Bahrain this week. On Wednesday, banks in Manama's
financial district closed down, the central bank operated from
an alternate location and the stock market stopped trading.
 
 DOWNGRADES
 Bahrain, home to a $66 billion Islamic finance industry, has
faced several downgrades by debt rating agencies since protests
started in February, and the cost of insuring its sovereign debt
has hit 20-month highs.
 Fitch Ratings on Tuesday slashed its sovereign credit rating
of Bahrain, which has postponed a $1 billion government bond
issue, by two notches to BBB, citing political risks.
 The scale of capital outflows from the smallest Gulf economy
of 1.2 million people is hard to estimate because of a lack of
timely data.
 The experience of Egypt is modestly encouraging for Bahrain;
when commercial banks reopened in Egypt in February after
political unrest, the central bank was prepared for an immediate
outflow of $8-10 billion from Egyptian pounds, but only about
$1.7 billion was transferred out on the first day and about $1
billion on each of the next two days.
 But anecdotal evidence suggest substantial sums have already
been moved out of Bahrain, whose banks hold assets of about $200
billion.
 One banking source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
estimated 15 to 20 percent of deposits and investments of
high-level Bahraini citizens in private banks had been withdrawn
over the past few days.
 ""A lot of clients are pulling out their money, they're
moving it to London, Europe, wherever. It's not a question of
taxes, but of access to their money,"" another banker from the
region said.
 ""One client pulled out $30 million in a matter of days. With
banks closed, movements are limited -- we will see the rush when
they reopen.""
 While nearby Qatar and the United Arab Emirates could
receive the fund flows, as they have so far escaped political
protests and have small local populations pampered by
petrodollars, some bankers said they would just be temporary
stops for the funds.
 ""In at least two or three banks, the bulk of the clients
have shifted their money abroad,"" a banker said.
 ""Some are moving it through the Emirates, then on to other
centres. It makes the transaction less remarkable, as moving a
big chunk of money from Bahrain to, say, London would raise
eyebrows in this climate.""
 Should the political crisis drag on, even long-term
investors may start to consider relocating their capital,
seriously undermining Bahrain's status as a financial hub where
foreign claims on banks amount to 92 percent of gross domestic
product.
 ""The type of money Bahrain was receiving is long-term
money,"" said John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque Saudi
Fransi. ""If uncertainty continues over several months and people
take out a lot of money, it will have a deep negative impact.""
 
 CURRENCY
 The dinar briefly weakened away from the 0.376 peg to the
dollar on Wednesday, dropping as far as 0.37716, but it soon
bounced back.
 Although the central bank had net foreign assets of just
$4.7 billion at the end of October 2010, many analysts said its
reserves would be enough to see off any threat to the peg,
especially because the peg system helps the central bank to
influence trade.
 ""We do not expect pegs to be broken. It would create a bit
of precedent in the region and many central banks and
authorities across the GCC have been priding themselves on
keeping the pegs unchanged,"" said Bartosz Pawlowski, head of
strategy for the region at BNP Paribas in London.
 ""In order to have a pressure on the peg you need to have a
really functioning market. The risks as we stand are minimum.""
 If necessary, Saudia Arabia might use its resources to
defend Bahrain financially, just as it is physically deploying
its troops, analysts said.
 ""Bahrain has foreign reserve resources to support the
currency and at the very end of the day even if there were
pressures, Saudi Arabia and GCC would likely alleviate pressure
through further financial assistance,"" said Farouk Soussa,
Middle East chief economist at Citi in Dubai.
 Bahrain, which needs crude oil prices as high as $97 per
barrel to be able to balance its budget, is set to receive $10
billion from its wealthier Gulf neighbours to upgrade housing
and infrastructure over 10 years.
 However, a tumble by the Bahraini dinar in the forwards
market on Wednesday suggested what might happen to the currency
if authorities did not maintain consistent support. The forwards
 briefly implied dinar depreciation of about 0.9 percent
in one year's time, before they bounced back.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The yen hovered near a record
high against a broadly weak dollar on Thursday, keeping alive
the risk of official intervention to stem the Japanese
currency's sharp rise.
 The dollar slumped to 76.25 yen  in early overnight
trade as the nuclear crisis in Japan forced investors to cut
back on carry trades and position for Japanese investors selling
overseas assets to bring home funds.
 Japan's current account surplus means at times of risk
aversion, Japanese investors are unlikely to be willing to
recycle yen into risky assets overseas.
 Speculators forced the dollar below the previous record of
79.75, triggering a cascade of stop-losses related to exotic
option structures and algorithmic selling of the dollar, sending
the yen surging in illiquid trade between the U.S. closing hours
and the Asian open.
 It stood at 78.59 in volatile European morning trade, after
buying by Japanese importers and some retail margin traders
helped dollar/yen claw back briefly on to a 79 handle.

 ""The G7 discussion is likely to be about pre-approval of
intervention by the Japanese and some degree of what would need
to happen for joint intervention to be necessary,"" said Ray
Farris, currency strategist at Credit Suisse.
""If dollar/yen lurches lower again, the Japanese will likely
be first to intervene and if market fails to respond to that and
looks disorderly, we might then get joint intervention,"" he
said.
 Traders said any co-ordinated intervention would be likely
to involve the help of the European Central Bank and the U.S.
Federal Reserve.
 Japan's finance minister Yoshihiko Noda blamed speculation
for the yen spike and said he was closely watching markets, a

 ""This entire move can be pinned down to speculative
positioning rather than any repatriation flows and in the near
term there is definitely a risk that this will continue,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. 
 ""Since it is speculative driven, intervention in this case
should work and clear out some of the long yen positions built.""
 The cost of hedging against a further yen rise jumped, with
implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen  trading
close to 20 percent, though still below levels seen at the peak
of the 2008 global financial crisis of around 30 percent.
 The yen also flew on the crosses, jumping around 6 big

six-month high, before falling back to 77.00 yen.

(Adds lawyer comment, graphic) 
 By Steve Slater 
 LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Regulators probing alleged
manipulation of Libor rates, the benchmark for interbank
borrowing costs, are focusing on five lenders, a person familiar
with the matter said on Thursday.
 Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, WestLB and UBS are
being investigated by regulators in Britain, Japan and the
United States, said the source, who asked not to be named.
 Swiss bank UBS had said on Tuesday it received subpoenas
from Japanese and U.S. regulators regarding whether it made
""improper attempts"" to manipulate the London interbank offered
rate.
 Thursday's Financial Times, citing people familiar with the
investigation, reported Barclays, BofA, and Citi had all
received subpoenas from U.S. regulators. Investigators had also
demanded information from WestLB, although the German bank said
it had not been subpoened, the paper said.
 Regulators contacted by Reuters, as well as Barclays, BofA,
Citi and WestLB, all declined to comment.
 Some lawyers said the regulators, who are investigating the
setting of dollar Libor prices in 2007 and 2008 -- just before
and during the financial crisis -- faced a tough task.
 ""Unless significant in terms of evidence, to prove such in
such turbulent markets would be less than clear cut -- and like
searching for the needle in a hay stack,"" said Tom O'Riordan, a
partner at law firm Paul Hastings.
 Libor rates spiked during the financial crisis but were
widely criticised at the time for not reflecting true market
prices. The system relies on banks providing honest prices and
the price provided by each bank being transparent.
 
 NERVY INVESTORS 
 During the financial crisis, lending effectively dried up as
banks hoarded cash amid uncertainty about the health of a
counterparty. Another problem was that banks were under intense
scrutiny, so any sign they were paying high prices to refinance
could have been seized upon by nervy investors.
 The British Bankers' Association (BBA) sets Libor prices
each day, providing a benchmark that reflects the interest rates
being used by the world's major lenders.
 The BBA said Libor has a straightforward and transparent
calculation method which excludes any rates that are significant
outliers. It declined to comment on the investigation.
 Thomson Reuters compiles and publishes the data on behalf of
the BBA. Reuters News is part of Thomson Reuters.
 Libor is calculated by banks contributing the rate at which
they expect to pay at 1100 GMT for loans with durations of one
day to a year, in a number of currencies.
 Sixteen banks contributed to the dollar rate in 2008. The
lowest and highest four contributions are discarded and the
remaining rates averaged.
 In December 2008 the BBA said it would enhance governance
and scrutiny procedures on the data and earlier this year four
more banks were added to contribute to the dollar rate.

 By Leika Kihara	
 TOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - Japanese markets have not become
destabilised enough to warrant joint G7 currency intervention or
government purchases of shares, Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano
said on Thursday, stressing that the damage from last week's
devastating quake to the country's economy would be limited.	
 Yosano also told Reuters in an interview an extra budget to
fund disaster relief and reconstruction was set to exceed what
Japan had spent after the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, but said
Tokyo should have no trouble financing additional spending. 
 The yen spiked to a record high against the dollar ,
while shares in Japan and elsewhere in Asia fell on
Thursday after U.S. officials said the risk of a catastrophic
radiation leak from an earthquake-crippled Japanese nuclear
plant was rising.	
 While financial markets initially focused on the likely
economic costs of Friday's earthquake, the unfolding nuclear
disaster has since taken centre stage, spurring investors to
dump shares and other riskier assets and switch to safer cash
and government bonds.	
 ""I don't think stock and currency markets are in a state of
turmoil,"" Yosano said, when asked whether the G7 advanced
nations should jointly intervene in the currency market to stem
yen rises. ""We would like to get psychological support from the
G7,"" he added.	
 Speaking later to reporters, Yosano said he expected the
group that comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada to work together to limit any knock-on
effect of events in Japan on prevent a knock-on effect of the
disaster on the global economy. 
 G7 finance ministers will hold a conference call on Friday
morning Japanese time to discuss steps to help Japan cope with
the financial and economic impact of the disaster.	
 Speculation is rife that Japan may step into the currency
market solo, or even ask its G7 counterparts for joint
intervention, to stem sharp yen rises that would add to pains
for the export-reliant economy.	
 With Tokyo stocks under pressure from global growth fears
and a strong yen, some lawmakers have called on the government
to support the market by with share purchases, but Yosano
brushed off such suggestions.	
 ""Now is not the time to consider such steps. Markets are
starting to stabilise,"" he said. 
 Yosano said the government's emergency budget would probably
exceed the 3.3 trillion yen in three extra budgets compiled
after the Kobe earthquake. 
 MORE BONDS	
 He said that while back in 1995 damage to buildings and
infrastructure amounted to 10 trillion yen, total damage was 20
trillion once indirect costs such as disruption to
transportation were included. Repairing the damage from last
week's quake will be more costly, Yosano said, which means the
government may need to issue new bonds to cover the costs.	
 ""It will be just several trillion yen of deficit-covering
bonds. How to fund the costs isn't a big problem. Both the
private sector and the government have plenty of funds, and the
Bank of Japan is providing ample liquidity. There's nothing to
worry about in terms of funding,"" Yosano said.	
 He also said the extra costs for disaster relief will not
force divert the government from its long-term fiscal reform
plans.	
 The earthquake hit Japan just when its economy was about to
emerge from a lull with output expected to fall sharply over the
coming months. Some economists warned it could result in a
deeper slowdown if power shortages prove significant and
prolonged. 
 But Yosano said Japan's economy was unlikely to suffer a
severe downturn, as demand for reconstruction work offset some
of the damage on output.	
 ""As a whole, Japan's (economic growth) won't turn hugely
positive but won't suffer a huge contraction either.""	
 Japanese administrative and business functions continue to
operate as normal, while the quake's impact on Japanese
companies operating globally will be limited, he said.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The yen briefly hit record
highs versus the dollar on Thursday as quake-hit Japan's nuclear
crisis unleashed a global risk sell-off, while world stocks
traded higher after Tokyo stocks came off earlier lows.
 Risk aversion fanned expectations Japanese investors would
sell overseas assets, including lucrative carry trades, to bring
home funds. The yen rose as high as 76.25 per dollar, levels
which raised intervention concerns.
 Developments at Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant remained a
main source of worry for investors. Japanese military
helicopters dumped water and a water canon was also used to
douse an overheating nuclear reactor but radiation levels at the
plant remained high.
 ""There is short covering at this point, and we continue to
see outflows,"" said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales
trading, at Global Equities, in Paris.
 ""Stocks might look oversold on the short term, but they are
not if we're heading into a bear market. The Japanese crisis
could have severe consequences for the global economy.""
MSCI world equity index rose 0.3 percent, moving away from
this week's three-month low. It hit 30-month highs in mid-Feb
but it has erased all of this year's gains.
 Tokyo stocks fell 1.4 percent, recovering from the intraday
low as cheap valuations attracted foreign buyers. Earlier this
week, Japanese stocks suffered their worst two-day sell-off
since 1987.
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index was steady on the
day. The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.6 percent as a recent
sell-off attracted bargain hunters.
 U.S. stock futures rose 0.7 percent, pointing to a firmer
open on Wall Street later after its fear gauge, VIX, hit 29.40
on Wednesday, its highest since July.
 ""A deterioration of the nuclear situation via a significant
increase in radiation levels would lead us to review our
positioning,"" said Paul Marson, chief investment officer of
Lombard Odier Private Bank.
 ""But if the authorities manage to contain the situation, the
Japanese equity market would appear to be extremely cheap by
historical standards in a particularly loose monetary
environment.""
 Emerging stocks fell 0.7 percent.
 U.S. crude oil rose 1.8 percent to $99.78 a barrel as
investors focused on concerns about potential supply disruptions
from an escalating turmoil in Bahrain.
 Bahrain arrested at least six opposition leaders, a day
after its crackdown on protests by the Shi'ite Muslim majority
raised fears of a regional conflict.
 
 INTERVENTION THREAT
 In European trading, the yen was trading at around 78.50 per
dollar. Traders said a break of 79.75 on Wednesday unleashed a
sharp selling of the dollar. 
 Japanese margin traders were cited as one of the main
factors behind the move as stop-loss orders were triggered in
their leveraged bets in currencies like the Australian dollar.
 Traders also said foreign investors were scrambling to get
hold of yen to settle margin calls on bets on Japanese shares,
forcing them to turn to spot currency at times as well as
forwards and cross-currency swaps.
 Japan's finance minister Yoshihiko Noda blamed speculation
for the yen spike and said he was closely watching markets.
Group of Seven finance leaders and central bankers will discuss
possible steps to calm markets at 2200 GMT.
 G7 finance ministers are not expected to agree firm policy
action, a G7 source said.
 The dollar hit a four-month low against a basket of major
currencies. The euro rose to a four-month high of $1.4014,
boosted by solid demand at a Spanish bond auction and on the
view euro zone interest rates may rise as soon as April.
 Spain sold 4.1 billion euros of debt, drawing solid demand
although yields for the 30-year bond rose.
 German government bond futures fell 30 ticks.

(Adds Hildebrand comments from interview with Swiss television)
 By Catherine Bosley and Sven Egenter
 ZURICH, March 17 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank kept
interest rates ultra-low on Thursday despite an overall improved
outlook for the economy, citing risks from Europe's debt crisis
and the devastating earthquake in Japan.
 The central bank dropped any reference to deflation risks in
its statement and raised its growth forecast, adding that
interest rates could not stay this low forever as inflation is
set to breach its price stability threshold by mid-2013.
 Economists said the more optimistic outlook opened the door
for interest rate increases later this year but the record-high
Swiss franc remains an obstacle.
 ""I would consider it playing for time. They want to see
others move first,"" said UBS economist Reto Huenerwadel said
about the SNB's assessment.
 The SNB held its target for the 3-month franc LIBOR
unchanged at 0.25 percent, as had been expected by all 37
economists in a Reuters poll.  [ID:nSLA9EE7R5]
 It said Europe's debt problems and high oil prices pose a
considerable threat to global growth, while the disastrous
earthquake in Japan has added a new element of risk.
 ""It is very difficult to judge the economic consequences
after such a short time,"" SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said
in an interview with Swiss television SF.
 ""A lot depends on whether the nuclear dimension materialises
in a serious way,"" Hildebrand said.
 Markets have pushed back their expectations for the SNB's
first post-crisis rate hike to December <0#FES:> following the
Japan disaster, which has driven the safe-haven Swiss franc to
record highs.
 ""We next forecast a rate hike in December, but things can
change quickly if the situation in the euro/Swiss franc
changes,"" said Credit Suisse economist Fabian Heller. ""If the
Swiss franc weakens, we could see an earlier hike.""
 Following the SNB statement, markets raised their bets
somewhat for a move in September. Swiss rates have been very low
since March 2009, when the central bank launched interventions
to fight the franc's surge.
 The SNB dropped any reference in the statement to deflation
risks, which had been an indication in the past that it could
resume the currency interventions that it stopped in June 2010.
 Hildebrand told the TV station later: ""We assume it (the
strong Swiss franc) will lead to a slowdown in the course of the
year through exports.""
 
 BRIGHTER OUTLOOK
 With low joblessness, booming real estate and consumers
willing to spend, conditions in the Swiss domestic economy have
been ripe for a rate rise for quite some time.
 The SNB raised its 2011 growth outlook to around 2.0 percent
from around 1.5 percent, in line with the government's view
issued earlier on Thursday.[ID:nZCHGEE776] The economy grew by
2.6 percent last year.
 Yet so far the SNB has shied away from tightening in order
to avoid an additional boost to the strong franc, which it has
called an ""extraordinary burden"" to Swiss exporters.
 The franc weakened against the euro and the dollar after the
rate decision. The franc was trading at 0.9013 per dollar at
1014 GMT, having soared to a record peak against the greenback
earlier in the day.
 The European Central Bank had indicated it might raise rates
in April to fight rising inflation, but expectations have been
dampened somewhat by the Japan crisis. [ID:nLDE72F0VC]
 An ECB hike would significantly increase room for the SNB to
tighten its own monetary policy, VP bank economist Joerg Zeuner
said, as higher rates in the euro zone would take some of the
upward pressure off the franc.
 Unlike the ECB, price rises in Switzerland have remained low
as the strong franc shielded the economy from rising oil and
food prices.
 The SNB raised its inflation forecast to 0.8 percent for
this year from 0.4 percent and to 1.1 percent in 2012 from 1.0
percent. It predicted inflation of 2.0 percent for 2013.
 The SNB still sees inflation crossing its 2 percent
threshold for stable prices in the third quarter of 2013.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2011 05:45AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-G7 will aim to calm markets as Japan nuclear crisis deepens," By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto	
 TOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - Financial leaders of the world's
richest countries will hold talks on Friday on ways to calm
global markets roiled by Japan's nuclear plant crisis and
concern it will unravel the world economy's fragile recovery.	
 Rising alarm over the unfolding disaster in Japan following
an earthquake and tsunami has sent shivers through world
markets, hitting shares and other riskier assets, such as
commodities, while prompting investors to scurry for the safety
of government debt.	
 The yen soared in disorderly trading to a record high
against the dollar on speculation Japan will repatriate billions
of dollars in overseas funds to pay for massive reconstruction
that is expected to be much costlier than the bill following the
Kobe earthquake in 1995.	
 ""I think the world economy is going to go right down and it
has happened at a time when financial markets are still
fragile,"" said a central banker of a Group of Seven country.	
 The comments, made on condition of anonymity, are a
testimony to the degree of concern among top policymakers about
the potential impact of Japan's triple disaster and in
particular its race against time to prevent a nuclear meltdown.	
 The G7 financial ministers and central bankers will hold a
telephone conference call around 2200 GMT on Thursday (7 am
Tokyo time Friday), Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda,
said as financial markets braced for potential currency
intervention following the yen's surge.	
 ""I don't think stock and currency markets are in a state of
turmoil,"" Japan's economy minister, Kaoru Yosano, said in an
interview with Reuters.	
 ""We would like to get psychological support from the G7,"" he
said. 
 
 The triple disaster, unprecedented in a major developed
economy, is already disrupting global manufacturing.	
 
 SUPPLY CHAIN	
 Makers of equipment for mobile telephones to carmakers and
chipmakers have warned of a squeeze on their businesses given
Japan's crucial role in many supply chains that keep global
commerce ticking over.	
 The technology sector felt an immediate impact after
Friday's quake and tsunami since Japan makes around a fifth of
the world's semiconductors.	
 NAND flash memory chips, used in various electronic gadgets,
soared 20 percent on Monday.	
 On Thursday, electronic conglomerate Toshiba Corp
said an assembly line that makes LCD displays for smartphones
and other devices will be shut for a month to repair machinery
damaged by the quake. 
 The company's shares are already reeling on speculation its
nuclear power business will suffer after governments globally
have raised doubts about the industry's future.	
 China suspended approvals for new nuclear plants on
Wednesday, effectively putting on hold the world's most
ambitious expansion plan. 
 Economists fear an extended slump for the world's
third-biggest economy with a recession possibly lasting two or
three quarters. Billions of dollars have already been wiped off
the stock market, a surging yen is threatening the economy's key
exports industry and an electricity gap that could last months.	
 The economy bounced back quickly after the Kobe earthquake.
Industrial output fell for one month but the overall economy
continued to expand.	
 ""The economic cost of the disaster will be large,""
economists at JP Morgan said. ""There has been substantial loss
of economic resources and economic activity will be impeded by
infrastructural damages in the weeks and months ahead.""	
 The effect on global economic growth may be more limited.
BNP Paribas estimates the disaster will shave 3 percent from
Japan's projected GDP this year, Paul Mortimer-Lee, head of
market economics, said. That would account for just 0.2 percent
of world output. 
 
 YEN POWERS TO RECORD HIGH	
 A big concern for G7 financial leaders will be the potential
for a surge in yen repatriation to Japan to unsettle global
markets.	
 In addition, many investors borrow in yen to fund
investments in other currencies, so may be vulnerable if their
positions are squeezed. That also would push the yen higher.	
 ""If there is a requirement for Japan to start to repatriate,
I think an important role that authorities might play is to make
sure that financial markets are stable,"" said Robert Rennie,
chief currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in
Sydney.	
 ""And if that involves the authorities helping to smooth
financial markets, under the cicumstances I think that is very
understandable,"" he said.	
 What also worries policymakers is that Japan's disaster has
come at a vulnerable time for the global economy and financial
market confidence following the global financial crisis.	
 The G7 talks will address the impact of the crisis on
economic growth, energy output, the supply chain and financial
markets, a French government source said on Wednesday. 
 Japan's central bank has pumped billions of dollars in cash
into its banking system to help stabilise jittery markets and
government leaders have called for calm.	
 Instead, market moves exposed an increasing nervousness over
the Fukushima nuclear power plant where engineers are scrambling
to prevent a meltdown.	
 Premiums on retail prices of gold bars in Tokyo rose on
Thursday to $2 an ounce over London spot prices from par before
the quake.	
 The yen soared to a record high of 76.25 per dollar, flying
past its previous record high of 79.75 which occurred in the
wake of the Kobe earthquake. The yen later back tracked to
around 79.00 per dollar, marking extreme volatility for a major
currency and relatively illiquid conditions.	
 ""Fear is the only factor driving the market today and if you
look at news about temperatures rising, things exploding, you're
not going to trade calmly, right?"" said Koichi Ogawa, chief
portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments.	
 Currency traders said the market was disorderly during the
yen's surge.	
 ""It's mayhem out there,"" said a trader at an Australian bank
in Sydney. ""The yen's been moving a big figure a second on
occasions. A lot of people are crying out for the central banks
to step in.""	
 Japan's Nikkei stock market index fell on Thursday
by 1.4 percent, for losses this week of more than 12 percent.
Shares elsewhere in Asia fell 1 percent, for
losses this week of 2.7 percent.	
 U.S. stocks lost ground on Wednesday on Japan concerns. The
broad S&P index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell
into negative territory for 2011.	
 The so-called Wall Street fear gauge -- the CBOE volatility
index -- jumped 21 percent, the biggest percentage gain
in almost a month.	
 With world alarm rising, operators of the nuclear power
plant in Japan dumped water on overheating reactors on Thursday
as engineers worked furiously to run power from the main grid to
fire up water pumps needed to cool two reactors.	
 ""The worst-case scenario doesn't bear mentioning and the
best case scenario keeps getting worse,"" said Perpetual
Investments, one of Australia's biggest fund managers, in a
market note.

 SNOW COMPOUNDS MISERY FOR TSUNAMI SURVIVORS	
 The plight of hundreds of thousands left homeless by the
earthquake and tsunami worsened following a cold snap that
brought heavy snow to worst-affected areas.	
 Supplies of water and heating oil are low at evacuation
centres, where many survivors wait bundled in blankets.	
 About 850,000 households in the north were still without
electricity in near-freezing weather, Tohuku Electric Power Co.
said, and the government said at least 1.5 million households
lack running water.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell on Thursday
and domestic investors said they were posed to keep selling on
rising yen volatility and a nuclear power plant crisis. Foreign
buyers, drawn to valuations as cheap as Lebanon's, steadied the
market after an early tumble.	
 The benchmark Nikkei average ended 1.4 percent lower at
8,962.67 points , recovering from the intraday low of
8,639.56, but the yen dominated the session.	
 The Japanese currency slid after surging past a record peak
against the dollar in illiquid, white-knuckle trading that could
have been linked to the stock market slump after an earthquake
and tsunami hit Japan on Friday.	
 The twin disasters led to overheating and fires at a nuclear
power plant in Fukushima, north of Tokyo, and the release of low
levels of radiation. Japan's military and power company workers
were still battling on Thursday to prevent further radiation
leaks.	
 ""The market is and will remain very volatile near-term,
it's very hard to trade based on any technical levels,"" Yutaka
Shiraki, senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. ""It would have probably have fallen more today
even if it wasn't for the yen.""	
 Construction stocks, expected to benefit from rebuilding
efforts, gained. Exporters and companies with facilities in the
disaster zone lost.	
 Elsewhere funds were unsure how to take positions for the
longer term, especially given the risks of both a possible
nuclear disaster and a yen volatility spike that has raised the
prospect of Japanese intervention in the currency market.	
 ""I can't take part in a market like this,"" said the manager
of a medium-size fund who normally invests in hi-tech and
semiconductor shares.	
 ""Is even a coordinated intervention going to stop
radiation?"" he said, asking not to be identified because he was
not authorised to speak to the media.	
 ""If volatility rises after a potential intervention, we'll
have more selling by investors who want to avoid risk.""	
 Massive stock selling may have triggered the currency
volatility in the first place, driving dollar/yen past peaks set
in the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake 16 years ago.	
 Hammered by a share selloff on Monday and Tuesday, foreign
banks have been scrambling to raise cash in yen to cover their
leveraged equity purchases, traders said. Japanese banks have
been reluctant to lend after the earthquake, worried about rapid
cash withdrawals.	
 That forced foreign institutions to use the forwards and
swaps markets to procure cash, contributing to the spike in the
yen.	
 The yen surged as far as 76.25 per dollar. As the dollar
recovered to around 79 yen, the Nikkei index also rebounded from
a loss of more than 4 percent. 
 The Group of Seven rich nations will hold a conference call
on Japan early on Friday local time (2200 GMT on Thursday), a G7
source told Reuters. Separately, Japanese Economics Minister
Kaoru Yosano told Reuters market instability was not great
enough to warrant coordinated currency intervention.	
 
 TEPCO TRADES	
 Tokyo Electric Power Co , the operator of the
stricken nuclear plant leaking radioactive material, plunged
more than 60 percent from its last traded price on Friday. It
was the most actively traded share on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
first section.	
 Big exporter stocks were the biggest drags on the Nikkei on
Thursday. Power outages, a stronger yen and radioactive
contamination from the Fukushima plant could cause havoc to some
technology exporters with operations near the affected area.	
 JP Morgan analysts estimate that of the companies with
factories near the plant, 150 milles north of Tokyo, Canon Inc
, Olympus , Tokyo Electron and Hitachi
High-technologies would take a big hit on operating
profits if their facilities in the area had to shut down for a
month.	
 So far this week, Canon and Olympus have outperformed the
TOPIX this week, falling 8 percent, leaving them vulnerable to
selling pressure. 
 The broader TOPIX was down 0.8 percent to 810.80 after
briefly rising to positive territory .	
 Nikkei futures listed in Osaka were down 0.8 percent to
8,930 , trimming some losses after falling as far as
8,400 at the start of trade. Futures slid a bit more in after
market trade to 8,810.	
 With the market regaining its footing, investors were
picking up construction-related stocks. Contractor Kajima Corp
was up 2.6 percent to 236 yen and Taiheyo Cement Corp
also rose 2.6 percent to 118 yen .	
 ""We're seeing at least 50 billion yen orders from U.S.
pension funds,"" said a trader at a Japanese financial
institution. Other traders and brokers reported buying from
foreign funds.	
 Trading volume fell to 4.1 billion shares, the lowest so far
this week. Tuesday's volume was a record 5.8 billion shares.	
 Japanese stocks were trading at 0.9 times their book value,
the same valuation as shares in Greece, Lithuania, Slovenia and
Lebanon, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange had the third largest capitalisation in the world last
year.	
 Five-year CDS on Japan was quoted at 104 basis points on
Thursday, roughly equal to South Korea's, but remained below the
peak hit this week near 124 basis points. 
 Ten-year Japanese government bond futures finished the
regular session down 0.02 point to 139.70 , giving up
gains held for most of the session. The cash 10-year JGB yield
slipped 2 basis points to 1.200 percent, still higher than
Tuesday's low of 1.145 percent .

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The yen hovered near a record
high against the dollar on Thursday, with speculators building
more bearish bets in the U.S. dollar and keeping alive the risk
of intervention by the Japanese to stem the yen's rise.
 As the shock of Friday's massive earthquake and tsunami
worsened into a nuclear crisis, the yen has climbed as investors
cut back on carry trades and positioned for Japanese investors
selling overseas assets to bring home funds. 
 A break through the previous record of 79.75 triggered a
cascade of stop-loss and algorithmic selling of the dollar,
sending the yen surging in illiquid trade in the hours between
the U.S. and Asian trading days.
 In early European trade, buying by Japanese importers and
some retail margin traders helped dollar/yen claw back to near
79.10 from a record low of 76.25 hit in early Asian trade. But
the huge earlier drop to the record was seen prompting other
investors to shed long positions in higher-yielding currencies
and buy the yen, traders said.
 With a high risk of Japanese authorities intervening if the
yen rises further from current levels, some market players were
waiting for an intervention-sparked spike in dollar/yen before
unloading positions, traders said.
 A stronger currency risks compounding Japan's economic
troubles at a time when it is struggling to contain a worsening
nuclear crisis. Many market players say it was only a matter of
time before Japanese authorities intervened.
 ""This entire move can be pinned down to speculative
positioning rather than any repatriation flows and in the near
term there is definitely a risk that this will continue,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
 ""Since it is speculative driven, intervention in this case
should work and clear out some of the long yen positions built.""
 Japan's finance minister Yoshihiko Noda blamed speculation
for the yen spike and said he was closely watching markets, a
warning that the Bank of Japan may soon be given the signal to
buy dollars.
 Group of Seven finance leaders and central bankers will
discuss possible steps to calm markets roiled by Japan's crisis
at 2200 GMT on Thursday.
 Japan launched a record one-day, $26 billion bout of
dollar-buying intervention in September when a stronger currency
was undermining the Nikkei average and threatening to worsen
deflation. FX analysts at Citigroup said there was
an ""extremely high"" risk of intervention in the next 24 hours.
They said there was also a significant chance that the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank could join the
Bank of Japan in a coordinated wave of intervention.
 ""I also believe that the U.S. and Europe will participate by
acting as an agent for Japan in buying foreign currency,"" Citi
analyst Greg Anderson wrote in a note. ""They might conceivably
even short the yen at their own risk.""
 
 JAPANESE RETAIL TRADERS
 Japanese margin traders were cited as one of the main
factors behind the plunge in the dollar as stop-loss orders were
triggered in their leveraged bets in currencies like the
Australian dollar.
 Just the day before, Japanese margin traders had built up
long positions in dollar/yen totalling $2.8 billion, according
to data from the Tokyo Financial Exchange.
 Traders also said that foreign investors were scrambling to
get hold of yen to settle margin calls on bets on Japanese
shares deeply in the red, forcing them to turn to spot currency
at times as well as forwards and cross-currency swaps.
 The dollar's collapse cracked the previous record of 79.75
struck in 1995 in the months following the Kobe earthquake.
 If Japanese authorities do not intervene, the 79.50 level
serves as a zone where investors may build up short positions.
Previous major lows between 79.75 and 80.21 will provide strong
resistance. But a break above 80.30 -- near the November low --
would be positive for a near-term dollar rebound.
 The cost of hedging against a further yen rise jumped, with
implied volatility on one-month dollar/yen and Aussie/yen
options reaching near 20 percent.
 The yen also flew on the crosses, jumping around 6 big
figures on the Aussie to as far as 74.50 yen, a six-month high,
before falling back to 77.80 yen. 
 The Aussie has shed about 6 percent against the yen so far
this week. The Aussie was at $0.9828 and fell as far as $0.9705
on Thomson Reuters Matching, a three-month low and a huge
reversal from $1.0143 at the end of last week. 
 The euro/dollar pair was a relative sideshow, up 0.5 percent
at $1.3971. The euro/yen was up 1.4 percent at 110.38 yen.

(Updates with more comments, finance minister, S&P)	
 By Leika Kihara and Rie Ishiguro	
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Japan's central bank doubled its
asset buying scheme to 10 trillion yen and supplied record funds
to banks on Monday to shore up confidence in the economy hit by
a triple blow of a massive quake, a tsunami and a nuclear
emergency.	
 The Bank of Japan said its action was a pre-emptive step
after markets swooned at the shock of Friday's 8.9 magnitude
earthquake and a tsunami that may have killed more than 10,000
and has left millions without power, water or homes. 
 The central bank said it was still sticking to its view that
the world's third largest economy would resume its moderate
recovery, though it warned about a likely drop in economic
output and vowed to do whatever necessary to limit the economic
fallout.	
 ""This time's earthquake has inflicted damage in a wide area.
Output is likely to fall for some time. We are also worried that
corporate and household sentiment will worsen,"" the BOJ said in
a statement after its board voted 8 to 1 to expand its 5
trillion fund pool put in place last October to support Japan's
recovery after the global economic crisis.	
 In an unanimous vote the board also kept, as expected, its
benchmark rate at 0-0.1 percent.	
 
 While the fund increase came as a surprise to some
economists, some said the central bank could have done more. 
""My initial impression is that the BOJ could have done more.
Its traditionally reserved stance on policy easing remains in
place even after the massive earthquake,"" said Masamichi Adachi,
senior economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan. 
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda, however, welcomed the
central bank's action and said the government would do its part,
though he warned that it would be hard to prepare an extra
emergency budget before the end of this fiscal year on March 31.
[ID:TFD006682]	
 Noda said the extra spending would probably exceed what was
needed after the 1995 Kobe quake, until now considered the
world's costliest natural disaster with total damage estimated
at around $100 billion.	
 Analysts said this time the threat to the $5 trillion
economy was compounded by a continued risk of a nuclear
catastrophe as engineers battled to avert a meltdown at a
quake-stricken nuclear plant 240 kilometres (150 miles) north of
Tokyo.	
 Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said planned power outages would
affect the economy ""by no small degree,"" even though there were
no data yet about the economic impact of the disaster.	
 Shirakawa also signalled the Bank of Japan's readiness to
ease policy further next month, saying the central bank will act
""appropriately"" at its two meetings in April when more data will
become avaiable to assess the damage from the quake on the
economy.	
 Standard & Poor's said that even though it saw no immediate
impact on Japan's sovereign credit rating, the quake added to
stress on its stretched finances and the economic damage would
depend on how the nuclear emergency plays out.	
The crisis struck at the worst possible time. The deeply
unpopular government of Prime Minister Naoto Kan is under
pressure to contain public debt that is already twice the size
of the economy, which struggles to sustain a modest recovery
from a deep and long recession. The prospect of Japanese
companies and insurers repatriating funds from abroad and
boosting an already strong yen further darkens the economic
outlook.	
 Noda said he would keep watching markets and noted that even
though there was an initial speculative spike in the yen, it has
later come off. 
 Prior to the rate review, the BOJ offered to pump a record
15 trillion yen ($183 billion) in the banking system, well above
the usual 1-2 trillion, to assure investors that markets will
function properly. Combined with funds that will be available in
further dates, the BOJ offered near 22 trillion yen in market
operations on Monday.	
 Bids fell short of offers, in a sign that the market overall
had sufficient cash, though Shirakawa said some money market
players could still suffer fund shortages.	
 Damage estimates also remain sketchy. Many factories have
been forced to shut in the area due to power outages, while
others have reported flooding or quake damage. 
 Tokyo's stocks plunged more than 6 percent
after the market reopened on Monday as investors tried to gauge
the huge economic cost of Friday's quake and tsunami. 
 Moody's ratings agency said it saw no major disruption to
Japan's payment system but that the economic fallout from the
disaster appeared greater than initially expected, even though
it was still waiting for a full assessment of the damage.	
 ""The economic consequences appear to be greater than we
perhaps originally expected on Friday,"" Tom Byrne, Moody's
senior vice president, told Reuters Insider in an interview.

 The BOJ said in a statement that there were no reports so
far of system glitches or funding problems at Japanese financial
institutions, including those in the quake-struck region.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell 7.5
percent, posting the biggest daily decline since October 2008,
and bond yields rose on Monday as investors expected the
earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country's northeast
to take an economic toll and require heavy government borrowing.	
 The drop on record-high trading volume among the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's biggest companies was compounded by fears about the
long-term impact on power supplies after the earthquake damaged
a nuclear generator. After an explosion on Monday, authorities
were working desperately to avert a plant meltdown. 
 Fears of more aftershocks and further repercussions from the
damaged nuclear power plant would probably continue to keep
investors on edge and weigh on the market this week. 
 The yen also slid against the dollar on hedge fund selling
after the Bank of Japan announced a total of 15 trillion yen in
fund injections to keep money markets stable. 
 The Japanese government bond yield curve steepened, with
super-long debt retreating as
market players anticipated the potential fiscal costs of future
rebuilding efforts, even as short- to medium-term JGBs rallied. 
 Japanese automakers, electronics firms and oil refiners saw
their share prices drop by double digit percentages at one point
after having to shutter key factories after Friday's earthquake
and tsunami, which are feared to have killed more than 10,000
people and severely damage infrastructure.	
 ""Investors are selling aggressively as they want to remove
risks. The market will sell until they have completed their
selling needs, but I really can't tell the extent of a possible
sales as this is not the normal market condition,"" said Hiroshi
Arano, advisor at Mizuho Asset Management in Tokyo.	
 ""The market will be very cautious about buying Japanese
shares even though the value of Japanese shares are attractive
after falls. The market will see the condition of the actual
state of the Japanese economy over the next two to three months,
before making any concrete decision,"" Arano said.

 CONSTRUCTION FIRMS IN DEMAND, TECHNOLOGY DUMPED	
 The benchmark Nikkei index fell 6.2 percent to
9,620.49, and slumped to a four-month intraday low at one point,
with technology companies such as Kyocera Corp and
Canon Inc among the biggest drags on the market. 
 The broader TOPIX index closed down 7.5 percent, the largest
daily decline since October 2008 in the wake of the Lehman
Brothers failure, to 846.96 . 
 ""Domestic investment trusts and funds are dumping everything
today. Sell orders for tens of billions of yen were detected,""
said an equities trader at a Japanese domestic institutional
investor, who declined to be quoted by name. 
 The Nikkei's fall comes after several months of solid
performance, in which Tokyo shares outperformed their emerging
Asian peers, and overseas investors flocked to Japanese
equities, buying roughly 3 trillion yen since November. 
 As of Thursday, the day before the earthquake struck, the
Nikkei had climbed 13 percent in the five months starting in
November, far outpacing a 1.7 percent gain in MSCI's index of
Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan.	
 Shares of Tokyo Electric Power , Japan's biggest
utility that owns a nuclear plant that may be close to meltdown,
were a big focus for the market. TEPCO ended ask-only at 1,621
yen, down 23.6 percent. 
 ""It will be very difficult for Japan to stop its reliance on
nuclear energy, and such energy is necessary for stable economic
growth of the country, so if the post-incident inspection is
negative, it will impact economy in the long run,"" Shinichi
Ichikawa, chief market strategist for Credit Suisse in Tokyo.	
 Construction-related businesses rallied on the back of
expectations for demand from rebuilding efforts, with Kajima
Corp jumping 22.2 percent to 259 yen and Taiheiyo
Cement climbing 21.2 percent to 137 yen .	
 In the month after the earthquake in Kobe in January 1995,
construction stocks outperformed the broader market consistently
for a year after the disaster, Citi research showed. 
 QUAKE COSTS	
 In the bond market, the five-year/20-year JGB yield spread
widened by 11.5 basis points to a three-month high of 159.5
basis points at one point,
indicating investors were selling longer-term maturities.	
 Super-long JGBs, 20 to 30-year bonds, were hit by concerns
about the fiscal impact from the damages caused by the
earthquake and as market players braced for the possibility that
Japanese life insurers may sell the segment of the yield curve
to fund payments to policy holders.	
 Underscoring concerns about Japan's fiscal health, Japanese
sovereign credit default swaps stood at 91 basis points, about
10 basis points wider on the day and near the peaks close to 100
basis points reached last year during the euro zone crisis.	
 Short-term to 10-year JGBs rallied, supported by the BOJ's
decision to supply ample liquidity to the money market.	
 The yen rallied broadly in early Asia but quickly pared
gains in volatile trade as nervous traders waited to see what
action Japanese officials will take to keep markets calm after
Friday's quake and tsunami.	
 The dollar initially extended its losses after having slid
more than one percent against the yen on Friday, touching a
four-month low around 80.60 yen . The dollar later
rebounded sharply in thin trade and last stood at 82.13 yen, up
0.4 percent on the day.	
The BOJ decided to expand the size of its asset-buying scheme
by 5 trillion yen to 10 trillion yen at its policy meeting on
Monday while keeping interest rates unchanged. Japanese
financial markets took the decision in their stride.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss	
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from
near-record lows against the yen on Monday, boosted by hedge
fund buying as the Bank of Japan's huge infusion into money
markets helped ease nervousness triggered by the massive
earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan. 
 The plunge in the Nikkei share average also
prompted a sell-off in currencies that thrive when there is
increased risk appetite, such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars .	
 The yen had advanced sharply on Friday on talk of
repatriation flows as the disaster unfolded and was seen likely
to extend gains especially if Japanese insurers try to raise
funds by selling overseas holdings. 
 On Monday, the country was battling to prevent a nuclear
catastrophe and to care for millions of people without power and
water. 
 The greenback tumbled as low as 80.60 yen on electronic
trading platform EBS, 1 yen away from a historic trough of 79.75
yen hit in 1995. But news of the BOJ's offer to inject a record
$183 billion into the money market helped the dollar pull away
from the day's low. .	
 The BOJ also further eased its monetary policy on Monday and
committed to increase the size of its fund pool for buying
assets and conducting market operations backed by collateral by
5 trillion yen, to 40 trillion yen. .	
 ""The force from monetary policy -- liquidity injections and
increased risk of FX intervention -- will partially offset a
temporarily more yen-supportive capital flow picture,"" said Jens
Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura Securities
International Inc in New York.	
 Overall, the bias on dollar/yen remains negative. 
 Crucial to dollar/yen's near-term direction is the size and
financing sources for Japan's reconstruction. While there are no
precise figures on the size of the country's reconstruction
efforts, the source of financing is more straightforward. 
 Analysts said funding to rebuild Japan's tsunami-affected
areas could come from a combination of public bond issuance or
asset liquidation by Japanese insurance companies in overseas
markets, moves that will likely strengthen the yen. 
 
The dollar rose as high as 82.469 yen on electronic trading
platform EBS, rallying from 80.60 yen , the lowest
since early November. By mid-afternoon Tokyo trading the dollar
was at 82.06 yen, up 0.2 percent. 
 Initial support this week is at 81.57, analysts at
ActionForex.com said. A break of 81.57 yen would make a target
80.93 as the next support, and a subsequent breach of 80.93
would signal the resumption of a downtrend. 
 On the upside, analysts said there is minor resistance at
82.38 and a move above that would turn the pair's bias to
neutral from negative. That would suggest that the sideways
consolidation from 80.29 is still in progress.	
 In line with the steep fall in dollar/yen earlier in the
global session, one-month implied volatility in the pair also
spiked to a roughly four-month high at 11.75 percent ,
from Friday's 9.65 percent.	
 One-month 25 delta risk reversals, a barometer of risk
sentiment, favoured dollar put/yen call options, suggesting
increased bullishness on the Japanese currency. On Monday,
dollar/yen risk reversals were quoted at 0.85/1.35 vols
.	
 The euro also recovered 0.4 percent to 114.35 yen from a low
around 112.62 yen . 
 A senior finance ministry official reiterated that Japan
would take decisive measures on currencies if needed, when asked
about the yen's strengthening against the dollar in the wake of
Friday's devastating earthquake. 
 ""The bottom line is it would be highly unlikely for Japanese
authorities to allow dollar/yen to fall sharply today. So on
that basis, it's going to be a nervy day but the downside is
going to be limited for dollar/yen,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist
at RBS. 
 Meanwhile, the euro firmed against the dollar after European
Union policymakers surprised markets over the weekend by
reaching some significant agreements ahead of the March 24-25
heads of state meeting.	
 Essentially, the summit agreed to increase the lending
capacity of the European Financial Stability Fund to its full
limit of 440 billion euros and also lowered the interest rate
charges for EFSF loans. 
 The euro was last at $1.3930 , up 0.2 percent on
the day.
Currency bid prices at 2:17 a.m. EDT (0617 GMT). All data taken

383,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2011 02:56AM ET</span>",FOREX-Dollar rises from near-record lows vs yen after quake," * BOJ injection underpins dollar/yen
 * Dollar/yen outlook still negative
 * Traders wary of possible BoJ action
 * One-month dollar/yen implied vols spike
(Updates prices, adds quote, more BoJ news)	
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss	
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from
near-record lows against the yen on Monday, boosted by hedge
fund buying as the Bank of Japan's huge infusion into money
markets helped ease nervousness triggered by the massive
earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan. 
 The plunge in the Nikkei share average
also prompted a sell-off in currencies that thrive when there
is increased risk appetite, such as the Australian and
New Zealand dollars .	
 The yen had advanced sharply on Friday on talk of
repatriation flows as the disaster unfolded and was seen likely
to extend gains especially if Japanese insurers try to raise
funds by selling overseas holdings. 
 On Monday, the country was battling to prevent a nuclear
catastrophe and to care for millions of people without power and
water. 
 The greenback tumbled as low as 80.60 yen on electronic
trading platform EBS, 1 yen away from a historic trough of 79.75
yen hit in 1995 . But news of the BOJ's offer to inject a
record $183 billion into the money market helped the dollar pull
away from the day's low. . 
 The BOJ also further eased its monetary policy on
Monday and committed to increase the size of its fund pool for
buying assets and conducting market operations backed by
collateral by 5 trillion yen, to 40 trillion yen.
.	
 ""The force from monetary policy --
liquidity injections and increased risk of FX
intervention -- will partially offset a
temporarily more yen- supportive
capital flow picture ,"" said Jens
Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura Securities
International Inc in New York. 
 Overall, the bias on dollar/yen remains negative. 
 Crucial to dollar/yen's near-term direction is the size and
financing sources for Japan's reconstruction. While there are no
precise figures on the size of the country's reconstruction
efforts, the source of financing is more straightforward. 
 Analysts said funding to rebuild Japan's tsunami-affected
areas could come from a combination of public bond issuance or
asset liquidation by Japanese insurance companies in overseas
markets, moves that will likely strengthen the yen. 
 
The dollar rose as high as 82.469 yen on electronic trading
platform EBS, rallying from 80.60 yen , the lowest
since early November. By mid-afternoon Tokyo trading the dollar
was at 82.06 yen, up 0.2 percent. 
 Initial support this week is at 81.57, analysts at
ActionForex.com said. A break of 81.57 yen would make a target
80.93 as the next support, and a subsequent breach of 80.93
would signal the resumption of a downtrend. 
 On the upside, analysts said there is minor resistance at
82.38 and a move above that would turn the pair's bias to
neutral from negative. That would suggest that the sideways
consolidation from 80.29 is still in progress.	
 In line with the steep fall in dollar/yen earlier in
the global session, one-month implied volatility in the pair
also spiked to a roughly four-month high at 11.75 percent
, from Friday's 9.65 percent. 
 One-month 25 delta risk reversals, a barometer of risk
sentiment, favoured dollar put/yen call options, suggesting
increased bullishness on the Japanese currency. On Monday,
dollar/yen risk reversals were quoted at 0.85/1.35 vols
. 
 The euro also recovered 0.4 percent to 114.35 yen from a low
around 112.62 yen . 
 A senior finance ministry official reiterated that Japan
would take decisive measures on currencies if needed, when asked
about the yen's strengthening against the dollar in the wake of
Friday's devastating earthquake. 
 ""The bottom line is it would be highly unlikely for Japanese
authorities to allow dollar/yen to fall sharply today. So on
that basis, it's going to be a nervy day but the downside is
going to be limited for dollar/yen,"" said Greg Gibbs, strategist
at RBS. 
 Meanwhile, the euro firmed against the dollar after
European Union policymakers surprised markets over the weekend
by reaching some significant agreements ahead of the March 24-25
heads of state meeting. 
 Essentially, the summit agreed to
increase the lending capacity of the European
Financial Stability Fund to its full limit of 440 billion euros
and also lowered the interest rate charges for EFSF
loans . 
 The euro was last at $1.3930 , up 0.2 percent on
the day.

384,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2011 02:52AM ET</span>",SNAP ANALYSIS-Protective walls critical to averting Japan nuclear crisis," By Elaine Lies	
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - The key to averting a nuclear
disaster at the quake-stricken Fukushima power complex in Japan
is ensuring the thick protective walls around the reactor cores
remain intact.	
 So far that is the case.	
 
 * A hydrogen explosion on Monday at the number 3 reactor
raised concern that the crisis is escalating, but experts insist
a Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster can be averted.	
 * Three units at the Fukushima Daiichi plant suffered loss
of coolant to their reactors following Friday's 8.9 magnitude
earthquake and the tsunami it triggered. 
 * So long as the thick containment walls shielding the
reactor cores remain intact, even a meltdown of the nuclear fuel
would not lead to a major escape of potentially dangerous
radioactive clouds into the air.	
 ""Everything I've seen says that the containment structure is
operating as it's designed to operate. It's keeping the
radiation in and it's holding everything in, which is the good
news,"" said Murray Jennex, of San Diego State University.	
 ""This is nothing like a Chernobyl... At Chernobyl (in the
Ukraine in 1986) you had no containment structure -- when it
blew, it blew everything straight out into the atmosphere.""	
 * Low-level radiation has been detected outside the plant
but at very low levels. These levels would need to rise
something like a thousand times before real fears are justified,
experts say.	
 * Every day without a major release of radiation increases
the odds of a good outcome. Once a reactor is shut down, there
is a lot of decayed heat that needs to be gotten rid of, with
the first four-to-seven days critical. Jennex says Japan, at
three days out from the quake and shutdown, would likely ""be OK""
if another day goes by without a major radiation release.	
 * Some of the fuel rods in the Fukushima Daiichi power
plant's reactors are exposed, so raising water levels around the
rods is critical and will help cool them down. Pumping seawater
into the reactors is a last-ditch measure, because the reactor
may not be able to be used again, but it can be effective.	
 Again, the key is keeping the reactor container intact.	
 * A release of plutonium at the number 3 reactor would be a
real sign of trouble because it is the only one using plutonium
as a fuel. This would signal that the fuel cladding had melted
and ruptured, and that a meltdown was in progress, experts say.	
 Similar signs from the other two reactors would be a release
of uranium-235 or maybe cesium. Cesium was detected on Saturday,
but the level remained low. The cesium released could also have
been due to contamination from old fuel issues, not a meltdown.	
 * If the containment wall is breached, the level of
radiation would rise sharply. 
 * At one point on Monday, levels at the stricken plant were
around 751 microsieverts, a dosage similar to a stomach x-ray,
Japans' nuclear authorities said. A fatal does of radiation
would be more than 7 million microsieverts.	
 * A sharp rise in radiation would be measured in
millisieverts, rather than microsieverts, as it has been up to
now, which would be potentially a thousand times higher.	
 * An explosion within the reactor vessel itself could damage
the container, but no signs of that have been detected yet. The
containment vessel also is designed to channel any melted fuel
to separate areas, which will help keep heat from building up.	
 * Additional warning signs would be a total evacuation of
the plant area or the wind dispersion area.

 By Leika Kihara and Rie Ishiguro	
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Japan counted the financial cost
on Monday of its worst catastrophe since World War Two as the
economy shuddered, prompting the central bank to line up a
record $183 billion in funds to stabilise the banking system.	
 Markets swooned at the shock of an 8.9 magnitude earthquake
and a tsunami that may have killed more than 10,000 and has
left millions of people without power, water or homes . 
 If that was not enough, engineers were battling to
prevent a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi complex
owned by Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) , where three
reactors were threatening to overheat in the worst atomic power
accident since Chernobyl in 1986.	
 The insurance cost of the quake, which hammered the
northeast coastline, could reach $35 billion even before the
tsunami is accounted for, said risk modelling company AIR
Worldwide. That is nearly as much as the entire worldwide
catastrophe loss for the global insurance industry in 2010.	
 A swathe of top-name Japanese manufacturers, including Sony
Corp , Toyota Motor Co and Panasonic
have shuttered production lines, with restart efforts hampered
by quake aftershocks.	
 About a fifth of the country's nuclear power generation
capacity has been shut down by the disaster. Thermal plants also
shutdown, forcing the world's third-biggest economy to instigate
rolling blackouts to conserve energy.	
 ""The economic consequences appear to be greater
that we perhaps originally expected,"" said Tom Byrne, senior
vice president at Moody's Investor Service.	
 
 Indeed, economists said that the triple blow of quake,
tsunami and nuclear accident is set to damage the already
struggling economy harder and longer that initially expected.	
 The analysts have grown increasingly cautious about
forecasting a quick economic rebound similar to that after the
Kobe earthquake in 1995. Some say a recession is possible.	
 ""Power supply is a critical factor,"" said Michala Marcussen,
head of global economics at Societe Generale. ""If power
production output is damaged in a sustainable fashion, that
could have a durable impact on the economy."" 
 
 MONUMENTAL TASK	
 TEPCO, the biggest power company in Japan, said on Sunday
rolling blackouts would affect 3 million customers, including
large factories and buildings from Monday onwards. It aims to
end the blackouts by the end of April.	
 Policymakers face a monumental task reviving the economy,
not only because of the scale of the disaster but because of
their limited options.	
 Japan's political leaders have pushed for an emergency
budget at time when the government is already fiscally
constrained by a public debt twice the size of the economy, the
biggest among advanced economies.	
 After the Kobe earthquake, the government adopted an extra
budget worth around 3 trillion yen.	
 ""This time, the government can't afford to spend as much as
after the 1995 quake given Japan's dire fiscal situation,"" said
Takuji Okubo, chief economist at Societe General in Tokyo, who
reckons a more realistic figure to expect is 1 trillion yen.	
 The Bank of Japan's interest rates are already near zero --
a legacy of the global financial crisis and years of economic
stagnation -- so it has limited room to cut again.	
 That is in stark contrast to New Zealand, where the central
bank last week slashed interest rates by half a percentage point
to 2.5 percent to support an economy hit by a 6.3 magnitude
earthquake on Feb. 22. 
 On Monday, the central bank pledged $183 billion to pump
into the financial system to make sure the economy had
sufficient cash.	
 The central bankers are reviewing policy on Monday and
economists expect the most likely outcome of the meeting to be
an expansion of a 5-trillion-yen pool of funds to buy assets,
such as government bonds. 
 Still, some say the scale of the disaster will prompt the
central bank to go further.	
 ""The BOJ is likely to take bold steps to stabilise the
financial system and is likely to revert to quantitative easing
or zero interest rate policy,"" said Naomi Hasegawa, senior
fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities in Tokyo.	
 
 STOCK SHOCK	
 The benchmark Nikkei stock average fell around 6
percent as concerns about rolling power blackouts hit the value
of auto and electronics firms and the yen slid against
the dollar. 
 Electronics giant Sony , maker of the Playstation
gaming console, dropped 8 percent. The firm has suspended
production at eight plants. Car maker Nissan Motor Corp
fell more that 8 percent after it shut down all four of its auto
assembly plants in Japan. 
 ""It will take quite some time until investors confidence in
Japanese manufacturers returns. When we look back at the Kobe
earthquake, it took about a week to get an overall picture of
magnitude of the damage,"" said Toshihiko Matsuno, senior
strategist at SMBC Friend Securities.	
 The prospects of a massive recovery effort boosted
contractor companies. Kajima Corp jumped more than 30
percent and Hazama Homes more than 40 percent.	
 The market ripples of Japan's disaster will be felt far
beyond the country's shores.	
 Wall Street is braced to feel some impact as companies that
trade with Japan face a loss of business and worries that
governments will look at nuclear power less favourably. S&P 500
futures were down 0.3 percent on Monday.

 Almost 2 million households are without power in the
freezing north and about 1.4 million lack running water. 
 Kyodo news agency said 80,000 people have been evacuated
from a 20-km (13 mile) radius around the stricken Fukushima
nuclear plant, adding to 450,000 evacuees from the quake and
tsunami.	
 An explosion rocked the number 3 reactor on Monday although
Jiji news agency said the core container was intact. TEPCO
shares were untraded as sell orders outnumbered bids 200 times.	
 The complex was rocked by a first explosion on Saturday,
which blew the roof off a reactor building. The government had
said further blasts would not necessarily damage the reactor
vessels.	
 TEPCO said on Monday it had reported a rise in radiation
levels at the complex to the government. 
Authorities had been pouring sea water to keep the fuel rods
in the reactors cool. Nuclear experts said it was probably the
first time in the industry's 57-year history that sea water has
been used in this way, a sign of how close Japan may be to a
major accident.	
 ""Injection of sea water into a core is an extreme measure,""
Mark Hibbs of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""this is not according to the book.""

 * No fiscal crisis seen yet, markets funding government
 * Moody's concerned about Japan's power, insurance, energy
companies

 By Rachel Armstrong and Saeed Azhar	
 SINGAPORE, March 14 (Reuters) - The impact from Japan's
devastating earthquake and tsunami looks to be worse than
originally expected but there are no signs yet of an immediate
fiscal crisis, Moody's Investors Service said on Monday. 
 ""The economic consequences appear to be greater than we
perhaps originally expected on Friday,"" Tom Byrne, Moody's
senior vice president, told Reuters Insider in an interview.	
 Byrne said that it looks like the death toll from Friday's
disaster will be higher than for the earthquake that hit Kobe in
1995. However, he said it remains to be seen whether the
economic damage would be as bad as the 1995 disaster, which cost
between $100 billion and $150 billion.	
 ""If it's as bad as Kobe, then it's pretty serious and if
it's worse than Kobe then we're in unchartered territory,"" he
said. 
 
 
 POSSIBLE OVERSHOOTING 
 Despite the damage, Byrne stressed there were no signs yet
that the country was facing an immediate fiscal crisis.	
 ""We still see that the market will readily fund the
government right now,"" he said. 
However, he added that the Japanese government's target of
issuing 44 trillion yen ($537 billion) in domestic bonds this
year would most likely be overshot due to funding needed for
reconstruction.	
He said that how the Japanese government bond market reacts
in the coming weeks to additional issuance could be crucial. 
 ""On the downside, it could move the day of reckoning a bit
closer, where the market hesitates to finance very readily JGBs
and they put on a risk premium because the amount of debt will
increase,"" he said.	
 Moody's last month changed its outlook on its Aa2 sovereign
rating for Japan to ""negative"" from ""stable,"" warning that a
downgrade was likely if the government fails to bring its
ballooning public debt under control.	
 Byrne said he saw no need to alter that rating.	
 ""We have a negative outlook, that still stands,"" he said.
""At least the way we see things presently, our assessment hasn't
changed much. In the near-term, Japan can cope with its fiscal
problems - issue debt at high prices and low yields - and that
hasn't changed yet.""	
 Japan's struggle to put a lid on the ever-rising public
debt, which at double the size of the $5 trillion economy is the
biggest among leading nations, has triggered a Standard & Poor's
rating cut and a slew of warnings from other rating agencies.	
 On the corporate side, Byrne said Moody's was concerned
about power companies such as TEPCO , refining
companies, insurers and a rail operator in the aftermath of the
earthquake.	
He said the mega Japanese banks ""seem to be okay"" because
they did not have much direct exposure to the worst-hit area in
northern Japan, although some regional banks could be affected.	
Byrne added that the yen currency could strengthen as it did
in the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake as the Japanese
government liquidated overseas assets to fund reconstruction.

 * Says no funding problems reported	
 
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will debate on
Monday whether to ease monetary policy further after a massive
earthquake and tsunami devastated the northeast of the country,
threatening its economic recovery, sources said.	
 The central bank earlier offered a combined 15 trillion yen
($183 billion) to the banking system earlier in the day to
soothe market jitters after Friday's quake and a wall of water
wiped out towns and villages, likely killing more than 10,000
people. 
 The BOJ said it was pumping the extra money into the banking
system even though no Japanese financial institutions had
reported funding problems or system glitches on the first
trading day after the disaster.	
 

Sources told Reuters the BOJ would discuss easing policy further
at a meeting starting at 11 am (0300 GMT).	
 The policy council is expected to discuss whether the sharp
fall in Tokyo stock prices and potential damage from the quake
to corporate profits warrant an immediate policy response, the
sources said.	
 Japanese stocks plunged around 5 percent in early
trade while the yen fell against the dollar.	
 The quake forced many firms to suspend production in the
stricken area, including some of the country's biggest exporters
such as Sony and Toyota .	
 With interest rates already near zero, analysts say the
central bank has few options but to ensure commercial banks do
not run out of cash as depositors rush to withdraw money and
provide funds to calm investors and keep short-term borrowing
costs from spiking.	
 The BOJ could remind markets that it is ready to boost an
asset buying plan launched last year. For more on the central
bank's options, see 
 BOJ members are increasingly of the opinion that ample fund
supply is needed as there will be a rise in demand for funds for
rebuilding after the quake, the Nikkei news agency reported.
They may debate expanding a fund to buy JGBs, corporate bonds
and ETFs to 10 trillion yen from 5 trillion yen, it said.	
 The disaster struck as the Japanese economy was starting to
show signs of reviving after shrinking in the fourth quarter of
last year. Exports had been expected to lead growth, offsetting
lacklustre domestic consumption.

 By Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell 7.6
percent, on track for the biggest daily loss since October 2008,
and bond yields rose on Monday as investors expected the
earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country's northeast
to take an economic toll and require heavy government borrowing.	
 The drop in Tokyo-listed shares was compounded by fears
about the longer term impact on power supplies after the
earthquake damaged a nuclear generator and authorities worked
desperately to avert a plant meltdown after an explosion on
Monday.	
 The yen also slid against the dollar after hedge funds
unloaded the Japanese currency after the Bank of Japan announced
a total of 15 trillion yen in fund injections to keep money
markets stable. 
 The Japanese government bond yield curve steepened, with
super-long debt retreating as
market players anticipated the potential fiscal costs of future
rebuilding efforts, even as short- to medium-term JGBs rallied. 
 Japanese automakers and, electronics firms and oil refiners
saw their share prices drop by double digit percentages after
having to shutter key factories after Friday's earthquake and
tsunami, which are feared to have killed more than 10,000 people
and severely damage infrastructure.

 ""The market will be very cautious about buying Japanese
shares even though the value of Japanese shares are attractive
after falls. The market will see the condition of the actual
state of the Japanese economy over the next two to three months,
before making any concrete decision,"" Arano said.

 CONSTRUCTION FIRMS IN DEMAND, TECHNOLOGY DUMPED	
 The benchmark Nikkei index fell 6.2 percent to
9,618.84, and slumped to a four-month intraday low at one point,
with technology companies such as Kyocera Corp and
Canon Inc the biggest drags on the market. Japan's
Nikkei stock futures fell 6.2 percent <0#JNI:> compared to the
regular session close on Friday, and last stood at 9,530
.	
 The broader TOPIX index was down 7.6 percent at 845.90
, on course for the largest daily decline since October
2008 in the wake of the Lehman Brothers failure. 
 ""Domestic investment trusts and funds are dumping everything
today. Sell orders for tens of billions of yen were detected,""
said an equities trader at a Japanese domestic institutional
investor, who declined to be quoted by name. ""Foreigners,
long-term European pension funds so far are on the sidelines,
they're not behind this sell-off,"" the trader added.	
 Shares of Tokyo Electric Power , Japan's biggest
utility that owns a nuclear plant in the northeast that may be
close to meltdown, were a big focus for the market. The stock
was untraded on a glut of sell orders and was last quoted at
1,621 yen, down about 24 percent from Friday's close.	
 Tokyo Electric has battled to cool damaged reactors at its
Fukushima plant damaged by the quake and subsequent tsunami on
Friday, forcing it to vent radioactive gas to relieve pressure
inside the reactors. The Fukushima plant was rocked by a
hydrogen blast on Monday, and officials were not able
immediately to confirm if any radioactivity was leaked.	
 ""It will be very difficult for Japan to stop its reliance on
nuclear energy, and such energy is necessary for stable economic
growth of the country, so if the post-incident inspection is
negative, it will impact economy in the long run,"" Shinichi
Ichikawa, chief market strategist for Credit Suisse in Tokyo.	
 Construction-related businesses rallied on the back of
expectations for demand from rebuilding efforts, with Kajima
Corp jumping 22 percent to 278 yen and Taiheiyo Cement
climbing 27.4 percent to 144 yen .	
 In the month after the earthquake in Kobe in January 1995,
construction stocks outperformed the broader market consistently
for a year after the disaster, Citi research showed. 
 QUAKE COSTS	
 In the bond market, the five-year/20-year JGB yield spread
widened by 11.5 basis points to a three-month high of 159.5
basis points , indicating investors
were selling longer-term maturities.	
 Super-long JGBs, 20 to 30-year bonds, were hit by concerns
about the fiscal impact from the damages caused by the
earthquake and as market players braced for the possibility that
Japanese life insurers may sell the segment of the yield curve
to fund payments to policy holders.	
 Underscoring concerns about Japan's fiscal health, Japanese
sovereign credit default swaps stood at 91 basis points, about
10 basis points wider on the day and near the peaks close to 100
basis points reached last year during the euro zone crisis.	
 Moody's Investors Service told Reuters the economic impact
from the earthquake and tsunami was worse than initially
expected, adding that Japan's target of issuing 44 trillion yen
in JGBs this year would most likely be overshot because of
financing needed for reconstruction.	
 Short-term to 10-year JGBs rallied, supported by the BOJ's
decision to supply ample liquidity to the money market.	
 The yen rallied broadly in early Asia but quickly pared
gains in volatile trade as nervous traders waited to see what
action Japanese officials will take to keep markets calm after
Friday's quake and tsunami.	
 The dollar initially extended its losses after having slid
more than one percent against the yen on Friday, touching a
four-month low around 80.60 yen . The dollar later
rebounded sharply in thin trade and last stood at 82.08 yen, up
0.4 percent on the day.	
The Bank of Japan, which holds a policy meeting on Monday,
injected 7 trillion yen into the money market via a same-day
operation. It later injected an additional 5 trillion yen in
same-day funds and a BOJ official said the central bank will
closely monitor the currency market in deciding the need for
further market operations.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks outside Japan
edged up on Monday, with demand for commodity-related shares
offsetting the steep drop in Japanese markets following a
massive earthquake and tsunami.	
 Construction and refinery shares across the region saw
healthy demand on hopes of bigger profits because of large-scale
recontruction efforts as the country battled to prevent a
nuclear catastrophe after the natural disasters that may have
killed more than 10,000 people. 
 Seoul shares reversed early losses to turn positive,
helped by solid gains in technology and automaker counters
following news of production disruption by its Japanese peers
while stocks in Taiwan trimmed early falls.	
 ""Tourism, shipping and insurance firms will clearly be hit
by shrinking demand from Japan,"" said Yu Rayming, chief investor
officer of Prudential Financial.	
 ""However, the downside for the overall stock market would be
limited. Demand for oil refining, steel and cement issues will
rise due to rebuilding after the quake,"" he said, adding his
firm's funds bought these shares today.	
 But heavy losses in Japanese stocks and concerns over
developments in the country's damaged nuclear reactors prompted
investors to stay largely sidelined with safe haven themes such
as weaker stocks and higher gold likely to dominate in the near
term.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^
 ""There are some investors buying on dips but overall
sentiment is still cautious especially with the nuclear
developments so we might see more volatility this week,"" Frances
Cheung, Asia-ex Japan strategist at Credit Agricole CIB said
referring to efforts by authorities to stem a broader fallout.	
 That spilled over to the rest of the region with Korean
nuclear power plant designer KEPCO down sharply
while shares in Australia's uranium miners slid as questions
rose on the near-term outlook of the industry. 
 The broader MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.2 percent after falling nearly 3
percent last week.	
 Japan's Nikkei share average closed down 6.2 percent
, the biggest single-day decline in two years, to the
lowest since November 2010.	
 
 TREASURIES WARY	
 U.S. yields nursed losses after Friday's spike but investors
grew wary of further selling pressure from Japanese insurers who
may sell some of their most liquid foreign assets such as U.S.
debt so they can respond to the earthquake. 
 Japan is the second-biggest holder of U.S. government debt. 
 Benchmark 10-year note yields were at 3.39
percent, up from 3.36 percent late on Thursday.	
 Brent crude fell nearly $2 to below $112 per barrel
after Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi regained control of some
territory over the weekend in the country's civil war.

 Wheat, corn and soy futures weakened as the quake
exacerbated an already-bearish mood circulating across
agricultural commodity markets in the past few weeks. Since
mid-Feb, the December 2011 CBOT wheat contract has fallen 18
percent.	
 However, massive reconstruction expectations pushed copper
prices above a three-month low hit on Friday.	
 In currency markets, the dollar rebounded from record lows
versus the yen after the Bank of Japan injected 7
trillion yen into the money market to help ease nervousness,
raising concerns that authorities might intervene to check sharp
gains.	
 Gold advanced by one percent nearing a record high of
$1,444.40 hit last week.

 * Yen likely to edge up on repatriation speculation

 By Antoni Slodkowski and Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO, March 13 (Reuters) - Japanese shares look set to
tumble this week while government bonds and the yen are expected
to gain, although market players are still trying to gauge the
impact of the country's worst earthquake in modern history. 
 Japan's Nikkei average may tumble below 10,000 on
Monday as investors will likely shift to safer assets following
after Friday's massive earthquake and tsunami, with the
long-term impact uncertain as nuclear disaster looms. 
 The Nikkei futures last traded in Chicago on Friday 
at 10,005, and initially investors said the slide might be
limited as major cities and manufacturing sites were mostly
intact.	
 But investors sentiment soured by Sunday night, with Japan
scrambling to avert potentially disastrous meltdowns at two
nuclear reactors and the extent of the total damage unclear.
    Market players also said a long-term rebound for stocks may
take much longer than after the 1995 Kobe earthquake. They noted
that holdings by foreigners, who deal heavily in large-cap
stocks affected by the quake, account for more than 60 percent
of the total market. In 1995, they accounted for 29 percent. 
 ""Initially all sectors will be under selling pressure.
The Nikkei can drop about 20 percent from a recent high of
around 10,900. It could fall below 9,000 in the near term,"" said
Masaru Hamasaki, senior strategist at Toyota Asset Management.	
 
 PUTTING PRESSURE	
 Another factor putting pressure on blue chip exporters such
as Toyota Motor Corp other auto- and electronics-makers
like Hitachi Ltd would be a possible strengthening of
the yen.
    ""Domestic investors, especially retail ones, may rush to
sell their foreign currencies and assets to shift back to the
yen as they may want to the Japanese currency. We've seen such a
move in the Kobe earthquake in 1995,"" Hamasaki said.	
 Construction companies such as Kajima Corp and
construction machinery makers like Komatsu Ltd were
seen as potential gainers on increased demand.
    ""A short-term sell-off must be inevitable, but
reconstruction moves may offset the long-term impact from the
earthquake,"" said Seiichiro Iwasawa, chief strategist at Nomura
Securities.
    Manufacturers will likely see sizable falls due to factory
closures. Nissan Motor Co halted production at all four
of its car assembly factories in Japan and will not re-start on
Monday while Panasonic Corp said continuing aftershocks
were preventing it from inspecting two factories in northern
Japan.
    Nuclear energy-related firms and utilities were also poised
to drop. The government on Sunday said there was a risk of a
fresh explosion at the Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO)
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, some 240 km (150
miles) north of Tokyo, after the roof blew off another reactor
building the previous day.
    ""The Nikkei may trade between 9500-10,000 for the coming
days, with an immediate support level seen at its 200-day moving
average of 9840,"" said Nomura's Iwasawa.
    The Nikkei fell 8 percent in the first five days after the
1995 earthquake that devastated Kobe and its vicinity. But it
rose 5 percent during the next 10 days, therefore history
suggests that this earthquake will not likely derail the whole
economy.	
 
 JGBS, YEN TO GAIN 
 Japanese government bonds are likely to gain initially after
the deadly earthquake dented Japan's economic outlook. The gain
may be led by the seven-year sector, the cheapest to deliver for
the futures contract. 
 The cost of insuring against Japan's default in the credit
swap market could rise on worries about its mounting debt and
that could put pressure on JGBs, particularly in the longer-end
of the yield curve in the future.	
 But such worries could be partly tempered by news that
Japanese ruling and opposition parties will put aside their
bickering to discuss a temporary tax rise to fund quake relief
efforts. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
last traded at 1.270 percent on Friday before
trading was suspended following the earthquake. 
 The benchmark futures stood at 139.27 at the end of
evening trade on Friday, having risen about 0.40 point from its
levels before the earthquake.	
 The Bank of Japan is expected to inject a large amount of
liquidity in money markets in coming days to keep short-term
interest rates in check. 
 The yen bounced back from an initial dip to rise on Friday
after the earthquake, a move reflecting some expectations that
Japanese investors could bring back funds from their hefty
foreign investments as happened in the weeks after the 1995 Kobe
earthquake. 
 ""Foreigners do not have many assets in Japan while Japan is
the world's largest creditor nation. And Japanese investors are
likely to bring some of their money back home,"" said Tohru
Sasaki, the head of forex research at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank.

 * Pressure seen easing on Greek, Portuguese, Irish bonds
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, March 13 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
will discuss the details on Monday of how to strengthen Europe's
financial safety net, after their leaders decided on Friday the
emergency fund should have more firepower and flexibility.
 The ministers will mainly be putting the finishing touches
to a comprehensive package of measures already outlined on March
11, aimed at ending the year-old sovereign debt crisis and
preventing a new one from happening.
 The measures agreed by the leaders still need formal
approval at the next EU summit on March 24-25 but seem to
address most of the market's concerns.
 ""In our judgment the overall impact on EMU (euro zone)
sovereign risk premia should be, at the margin, positive,""
Goldman Sachs investment bank said in a research note. 
 IHS Global Insight chief euro zone economist Howard Archer
said market pressure on Greek, Portuguese and Irish bonds was
likely to ease for now.
 The leaders agreed on Friday that the effective lending
capacity of the euro zone rescue fund, the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), should be raised from the current 250
billion euros to the nominal value of 440 billion euros.
 The effective capacity of the EFSF is now lower than the
nominal value, because not all euro zone countries issuing
guarantees have the triple A rating that the fund wants.
 Euro zone ministers will discuss on Monday how to achieve
the higher lending capacity, but a euro zone source involved in
the discussions said the likely solution was that all euro zone
countries would raise their guarantees for EFSF borrowing. 
 These guarantees, on a pro rata basis, now stand at 120
percent of a country's share in the capital of the European
Central Bank.
 The ministers will also have to decide how to implement
other changes to the fund agreed by the leaders -- allowing the
EFSF to buy bonds of distressed sovereigns at primary bond
auctions and lowering the interest rate charged for the loans.
 The ministers will be joined later in the day by finance
ministers from the 10 European Union countries that do not use
the euro and together they will discuss the technical aspects of
setting up the successor to the EFSF, the European Stability
Mechanism, which will become operational in mid-2013.
 Euro zone leaders would like the ministers to decide on the
appropriate mix of paid-in capital, callable capital and
guarantees that will back the ESM's 500 billion euro effective
lending capacity, and on the timetable for paying it.
 The ESM will provide financial help to euro zone countries
that are solvent but have liquidity problems, after a unanimous
decision by euro zone countries and on the basis of a debt
sustainability assessment by the European Commission, the IMF
and the ECB.
 Like the EFSF, the ESM will be able to intervene in the
primary bond market and the price of its loans will be in line
with IMF pricing principles.
 But if the IMF and the Commission decide a country's debt is
unsustainable, the government will have to negotiate a debt
restructuring deal with its creditors. 
 To facilitate that, all bonds issued in the euro zone from
mid-2013 will carry collective action clauses that prevent
minority bond holders from blocking a restructuring deal for the
majority.
 EU finance ministers will end their day with a discussion on
tougher EU budget rules and a mechanism to monitor and correct
macro-economic imbalances in the single currency area.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2011 02:20PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Japan quake risks severe near-term economic damage," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - A triple blow of earthquake,
tsunami and one of Japan's worst nuclear accidents is set to
damage the world's third largest economy, possibly more deeply
and for longer than initially expected.
 Power outages and possible tax rises are likely to hurt
companies and households and could outweigh the mild economic
aftershock from the 1995 Kobe earthquake, given that oil prices
and the yen are stronger and Japan's debt pile is much bigger.
 Rolling blackouts will start Monday, affecting businesses
and households as the country grapples with its worst crisis
since World War Two. More than 1 million people are without
water or power and towns have been wiped off the map.
 Already saddled with debt that is double the size of its $5
trillion economy and threatened by credit downgrades, the
government is discussing a temporary tax rise to fund relief
work.
 Japan's economic growth is in a better profile than it was
when the Kobe quake struck. But many say a noticeable hit to
GDP, which was only just recovering from contraction at the end
of 2010, is likely to be felt over the next several months.
 ""When we talk about natural disasters, we tend to see an
initial sharp drop in production... then you tend to have a
V-shaped rebound. But initially everyone underestimates the
damage,"" said Michala Marcussen, head of global economics at
Societe Generale.
 ""Power supply is a critical factor. If power production
output is damaged in a sustainable fashion, that could have a
durable impact on the economy.""
 Tokyo Electric Power Co said on Sunday it may have to
conduct rolling blackouts in winter, in addition to summer.
 ""The earthquake will bring lots of things to a halt. We are
going to see quite a dent on GDP, blackouts will lead to a sharp
contraction of production,"" said Janwillem Acket, group chief
economist at Julius Baer.
 He estimated the damage would be felt for two quarters, but
it was not likely to knock the economy back into recession.
 ""We know public finances are already weak, much weaker than
they are during Kobe. Pressure for emergency tax hikes is there.
But I don't think the economy will go back to recession.""

 GROWTH IMPACT
 Following the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the economy shrank by 2
percent, followed by a V-shaped recovery. Back then, oil prices
were hovering around $17-21 a barrel while the yen -- key to
exporters -- was at around 100 per dollar when the quake hit.
 Currently with oil prices at near 2-1/2 year high above $100
and the Japanese currency at a stronger 82 per dollar, the
impact from these two factors alone will be more adverse.
 Japan's gross domestic product shrank by an annualised 1.3
percent in Q4. A Reuters poll published before the quake showed
it was likely to expand 0.5 percent in Q1, or roughly two
percent on an annualised basis.
 ""The Japanese economy is now likely to take longer than we
expected to exit its current lull. We had projected an
April-June exit but now forecast July-September or possibly
October-December,"" Nomura said in a note to clients.
 Nomura expects the largest negative impact on quarterly real
GDP growth will emerge in April-June 2011.
 ""Based on the experience of the Kobe earthquake, we think a
V-shaped recovery supported by a rapid upturn in demand driven
by government-funded rebuilding work in the affected areas is
also unlikely,"" it said.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects the quake-hit areas
account for up to 7.8 percent of Japan's GDP, compared with 12.4
percent from the regions affected by the Kobe earthquake.
 The bank expects the hit to GDP to be at least 0.2-0.3
percentage point, although a relatively large amount of spare
capacity may offset the production loss. 
 The yen rose sharply following the Kobe earthquake as
Japanese companies repatriated capital, a pattern which may
gather momentum in the coming week.
 However, possible measures from the Bank of Japan may bring
two-way flows into the market.
 The BOJ is likely to provide 2-3 trillion yen in funds
through its market operations Monday morning, two to three times
the normal amount, to soothe markets and keep short-term
borrowing costs from spiking. 
 The central bank may ease monetary policy further. With
interest rates virtually at zero, the most likely option is for
the BOJ to top up the 5 trillion yen pool of funds it put in
place last year to buy assets ranging from government bonds to
private debt -- a factor that could weigh on the yen.
 Nomura said the BOJ could increase the scale of its asset
purchases to 8-10 trillion yen.
 
 MORE DEBT
 Another obstacle is Japan's fragile debt position, already
double the size of its $5 trillion gross domestic product.
 BofA Merrill Lynch expects the cost for the rebuilding could
be at least 1.0 percent of GDP, while Nomura expects the size of
any extra budget for rebuilding to exceed 3 trillion yen.
 Brendan Brown, economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, said
it seems plausible that the debt costs could add between 2
percent to 10 percent of GDP to its massive public debt load.
 This could hit its credit rating again. Japan was downgraded
by Standard & Poor's in January given the lack of a plan to fix
public finances and Moody's has warned it may do the same. 
 Others also suggested the government may tap into its $1
trillion-plus foreign exchange reserves -- the world's second
largest -- to finance relief work.
 ""Normally you don't think about using foreign exchange
reserves for this but it's possible,"" Marcussen said.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2011 10:48AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Japan markets and economy after Kobe earthquake," March 13 - The biggest earthquake on record in Japan and a
tsunami hammered the country's northern coastline, causing
widespread destruction and raising the prospect of significant
economic damage.	
 The following shows how Japanese markets and the economy
performed and fiscal and monetary authorities reacted following
the Kobe earthquake in 1995:	
 
 * The earthquake:	
 -- The Kobe earthquake happened in the early hours of Jan.
17, 1995. It had a magnitude of 7.3 and killed more than 6,400
people. Damage was estimated at $100 billion.	
 
 * The economy: 
 -- Industrial output in January 1995 fell by 2.6 percent,
but then rose for three consecutive months by 2.2 percent, 0.9
percent and 1.3 percent.	
 Economic growth through 1995 was relatively strong. First
quarter activity expanded at an annualised rate of 3.4 percent.
The following two quarters saw growth of 3.2 percent and 3.9
percent, respectively, before a pull back when the economy
shrank 0.6 percent in the last quarter of the year.	
 The effects of rebuilding were felt in 1996 when annualised
growth rates each quarter were; 3.7 percent, 4.0 percent, 0.9
percent and 5.9 percent.	
 
 * Currency: 
 -- The yen was on a tear at the time of the Kobe earthquake.
It had rallied from just over 160 yen per dollar in 1990 to 99
yen at the end of 1994. After the Kobe earthquake struck, the
yen extended the rise to a record high of 79.75 as investors
repatriated funds from overseas. However, trade tensions with
the United States were also a factor behind the yen's rise.	
 In the shorter term, the yen fell briefly after the Kobe
earthquake. The day before the disaster, the yen had closed
around 98.40 per dollar. It fell on the day of the quake to
99.11 and the following day to 99.69. In then traded largely
steady until resuming its long-term rally in early February.	
 
 * Stocks: 
 -- The Nikkei average fell on the day of the quake
by 0.5 percent and then on the four days that followed. It
continued to fall, losing more than 16 percent by the end of the
quarter. However, one reason for the fall was concern over the
rise in the yen and how that could undermine export earnings. By
the end of the year, the Nikkei recovered all of its losses.	
 
 * Bank of Japan: 
 -- The central bank provided special loans of up to 1
trillion yen to financial institutions that had branches in
affected areas after the quake from July 1996 to July 1997.	
 It initially had a one-year program but extended it for
another year.	
 
 * Fiscal policy: 
 -- Japan spent roughly 3.4 trillion yen in three extra
budgets - one compiled in fiscal 1994/95 (April/March) and two
others compiled in fiscal 1995/96 - for disaster relief and
reconstruction after the quake.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2011 07:33AM ET</span>",Q+A-UPDATE 1-Dangers posed by Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant ," (Adds details on second reactor, comments)	
 By Fredrik Dahl	
 VIENNA, March 13 (Reuters) - Japanese authorities struggled
on Sunday to prevent a disaster at two reactors at the
quake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant a day after an explosion
and radiation leak in the wake of a massive earthquake.	
 Operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) began
using sea water and boric acid to cool its No.1 reactor after an
explosion blew off the roof and upper walls of its external
concrete building during an attempt to release pressure. The
containment structure surrounding it, however, remained intact.	
 In addition, air was being released from the No.3 reactor's
container vessel to lower pressure inside and avoid damage.	
Assessments of the danger varied. The critical issue is what
happens to the radioactive reactor fuel.	
 ""We don't know enough about what the status of the fuel is
in the reactor core,"" nuclear expert Mark Hibbs of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace said. ""The issue is whether
the core is uncovered, whether the fuel is breaking up or being
damaged, or whether the fuel is melting.""

 WHAT HAPPENED?	
 An explosion occurred at the 40-year-old Daichi 1 reactor as
TEPCO tried to reduce pressure in the core after the total loss
of power needed to keep water circulating to prevent it from
overheating.	
 This led to fears of a disastrous meltdown at the plant,
which shut down automatically after Friday's quake.	
 The government later said radiation levels were low because
the explosion had not affected the reactor core container,
although it had severely damaged the main building.	
 On Sunday, TEPCO began filling the container structure with
seawater which will be mixed with boric acid to
prevent any elevation in nuclear reaction, the government said.	
 ""The most probable (cause of the blast) is that the coolant,
particularly if it's water, can overheat and turn to steam more
rapidly than it was designed to,"" said nuclear fuel technology
professor Timothy Abram at Manchester University.	
 The cause and exact location of the blast still needs to be
established, said nuclear physics professor Paddy Regan at
Surrey University. ""So far it looks like it's not the reactor
core that's affected, which would be good news.""	
 The World Nuclear Association, a London-based industry body,
said the blast was probably due to hydrogen igniting and that
this was unlikely to cause a big accident by itself.	
 ""It is obviously an hydrogen explosion,"" communications
director Ian Hore-Lacy said. ""If the hydrogen has ignited, then
it is gone, it doesn't pose any further threat.""	
 
 WILL THE SEAWATER WORK?	
 David Lochbaum, director of the Union of Concerned
Scientists Nuclear Safety Project, said the seawater is a sign
of trouble but may be effective.	
 ""The use of seawater means they have run out of options. If
they had any other water they would have used it. It likely
means the power for their pumps is gone. They must be pumping
the seawater in.""	
 However he did say ""So long as they keep the seawater over
the fuel, the situation should be OK - so long as the fuel was
not damaged."" The low levels of radiation reported could be a
sign that the fuel is not damaged - damaged fuel would release
much larger amounts of radiation than we have heard so far.	
 As the lesson of Three Mile Island demonstrates, if cooling
to the reactor core is restored, a meltdown can be stopped.
Keeping the reactor fuel cool is key.	
 
 HOW SERIOUS COULD IT BE?	
 Views differ. Stratfor, a risk consultancy, initially said
there appeared to be a reactor meltdown, but others disagreed,
dismissing any comparisons with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster in Ukraine.	
 In an updated analysis, Stratfor said new
developments ""may suggest positive signs for authorities'
efforts to contain the problem."" But ""many dangers and risks
remain,"" it added.	
 Abram, the Manchester professor, said it was unlikely it
would develop into anything more serious, though this would
depend on the integrity of the fuel. He believed it ""pretty
unlikely"" that the fuel had been significantly damaged.	
 ""If the fuel is substantially intact, then there'll be a
much, much lower release of radioactivity and the explosion
that's happened might be just due to a buildup of steam in the
reactor circuit,"" he said.	
 Apparently backing this view, the government said the
plant's concrete building collapsed in the blast, but the
reactor container inside did not explode.	
 The top government spokesman said TEPCO, the operator,
planned to fill the leaking reactor with sea water to cool it
down and reduce pressure.	
 Carnegie's Hibbs said: ""If they are suggesting that the
reactor vessel is intact and that they have a way to get cold
water into the core of the reactor to cool that core down, that
is very good news indeed.""	
 It is too early to say that a ""catastrophe has been
averted,"" Stratfor said.	
 A nuclear technology expert who declined to be identified
said the situation was still ""very serious"" as the cause of the
explosion had yet to be determined. He blamed the accident on
rising pressure inside the reactor.

 By Walter Brandimarte	
 NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Japan will suffer an economic
hit from Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami and then
get a boost from reconstruction, but forecasts are increasingly
cautious as the scale of the disaster emerges.	
 Japan bounced back from its last massive natural disaster, a
1995 earthquake that wrecked the key port of Kobe. But the new
calamity, which entailed devastation by a mammoth wall of water,
has happened at a time when Japan's economy is much weaker than
in 1995.	
 Japan is also now weighed down by the largest public debt
among advanced economies, double the size of its $5 trillion
gross domestic product.	
 Added to which, the full-scale and consequences of a
disaster Prime Minister Naoto Kan has declared the biggest since
World War II, are growing as details of the devastation become
apparent.	
 Media reports said the death toll could rise to 10,000.
Almost two million households are without power and about 1.4
million are without running water.	
 Engineers are fighting to avert a disastrous meltdown at a
nuclear plant following the disaster.	
 ""There are so many uncertain factors such as the number of
casualties and missing, so I still can't figure out how
extensive the damage will turn out to be and how it will impact
on the overall economy's growth,"" said Kyohei Morita, chief
economist Japan for Barclays Capital.	
 Most economists suggested the economy would slow down in
April through June before picking up again as reconstruction
activity kicks in.	
 But an accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant owned
by Tokyo Electric Power Co added a new dimension.
Authorities have evacuated 140,000 people from around the plant
and leaked radiation to bring the reactor back under control in
the worst nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.	
 ""Not since the Cold War have I been asked to think about the
economic consequences of a nuclear explosion in a densely
populated area in a modern industrial economy,"" said Carl
Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.	
 ""I don't relish that task.""	
 
 
 PRE-QUAKE STRUGGLING	
 Japan's economy was already struggling before the disaster.	
 Its gross domestic product shrank by an annualized 1.3
percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. A Reuters poll published
before the quake showed economists expected GDP to resume
growing in the first quarter, expanding by 0.5 percent from the
previous quarter. 
 Many analysts said while the economy might not return to
growth in the first quarter, it will pull through by the end of
the year.	
 Takahide Kiuchi, chief economist at Nomura Securities in
Tokyo, said on Sunday that Japan's growth rate will be hit
harder by this disaster than it was by the Kobe quake. 
 Kiuchi said that production ""may slump longer this time than
after the Kobe quake. But it will still be for just several
months."" He also said ""we don't think the economy will falter.""	
 As for the world economy, Japan is not a major engine of
global growth so the disaster poses less of a risk to other
countries than soaring oil prices caused by turmoil in the
Middle East and North Africa.	
 ""The global economy will be fine,"" said Stephen Stanley,
chief economist at Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.	
 Some are more optimistic than Kiuchi about the push that
rebuilding northeastern Japan should provide.	
 ""After an initial decline in GDP growth, (Japan's) economic
activity will rise driven by reconstruction,"" said Mohamed
El-Erian, who helps oversee more than $1.1 trillion in
investments at PIMCO.	
 Japan might see GDP expand by more than 3 percent in
annualized terms over the next three quarters if the pattern
seen from the smaller 7.2 magnitude Kobe earthquake is anything
to go by, analysts said. 
 Friday's quake, which sent a tsunami surging through coastal
towns and cities, was centered around the northeastern city of
Sendai in a region that is home to auto manufacturing and
semiconductor factories.	
 
 MORE DEBT	
 One of the most worrying impacts of the earthquake will be
Japan's already fragile debt position.	
 ""The timing of the disaster could not have been much worse,""
Capital Economics said in a research note.	
 ""A large part of the reconstruction costs will probably have
to be met by local authorities and ultimately by central
government, which is already struggling to bring public debt
under control,"" it said.	
 Brendan Brown, economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, said
it ""seems plausible"" that the debt costs could add between 2
percent to 10 percent of GDP to its massive public debt load.	
 If public debt grows more than 5 percent, ""there would be
the speculation as to whether the Japanese government would dip
into its massive holdings of foreign exchange reserves and, say,
sell U.S. T-bonds rather than issuing huge additional quantities
of JGBs,"" Brown said.	
 It is unimaginable that Japan would restructure its debt but
investors might expect higher inflation and a weaker yen as ways
to help it to cope with its debt burden, he said.	
 This could hit its credit rating again. Japan was downgraded
by Standard & Poor's in January given the lack of a plan to fix
public finances and Moody's has warned it may do the same.

 STRONGER YEN	
 The yen , which jumped more than 1 percent to 81.87
per dollar following the quake on Friday, likely will gain
further in the following days, depending on the size of
repatriation from insurers and other companies.	
 The Bank of Japan on Sunday said it had extended a total of
55 billion yen to 13 financial institutions in the quake-struck
northeast since Saturday to help them secure enough funds to
meet deposit withdrawals. 
 On Monday, the BOJ holds a one-day policy meeting and will
pledge to supply as much money as needed to keep the calamity
from destabilising markets and its banking system.

 ""We expect that the foreign exchange market will take its
cues from the immediate monetary and fiscal response,"" Citigroup
analysts said in report.	
 Another intervention by the BOJ in the currency market to
curb yen strength is a possibility, said Mansoor Mohi-uddin,
head of foreign exchange strategy at UBS Macro Research.	
 ""We don't expect USD/JPY to break through 80,"" he said in a
research note. ""Instead we think the Ministry of Finance would
follow up its action of September last year by instructing the
Bank of Japan to intervene in the currency markets again.""

 VIENNA, March 12 (Reuters) - Radiation leaked from Japan's
earthquake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on Saturday
after a blast blew its roof off. Assessments of the potential

 * North Africa turmoil casts sub-Sahara in favourable light
 * Asset reallocation unlikely unless Egypt recovery wanes
 * Nigerian election in April will be big test for Africa
 
 By Ed Cropley
 JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Reuters) - Political turmoil
sweeping through North Africa is likely to mean more investment
scrutiny for countries across the continent, although many south
of the Sahara are likely to pass the test comfortably.
 With as many as 20 national votes likely in 2011 -- the most
in any calendar year since Africa started to shake off the
colonial shackles half a century ago -- political turbulence was
always going to rank high on the agenda.
 The increasingly bloody crisis since Ivory Coast's November
election set an ominous tone, but the unforeseen uprisings that
have rocked authoritarian regimes in the north have cast the
rest of the continent in a different light.
 As Zambian President Rupiah Banda pointed out at the Reuters
Africa Investment Summit in Johannesburg this week, many
sub-Saharan states went through the wrenching transition from
autocracy to pluralism a generation ago.
 ""Our opposition leaders are calling on people to go on to
the streets and remove this government, forgetting that in 1991
the Zambian people removed the one party state. They moved
towards multi-party democracy,"" said Banda, who faces an
election before September.
 ""We have gone through that period long before.""
 Ivory Coast aside -- and excepting the likes of Zimbabwe and
the irregularities that are commonplace in many more functional
African democracies -- other ballots in the region have not gone
too badly.
 
 ELECTION TESTS
 In Uganda, the shilling hit a record low against the dollar
amid fears of violence or worse after a Feb. 18 presidential
election, but it passed off largely without incident.
A big test looms in April for Nigeria, the continent's most
populous nation and a democratic stripling having only ended
military rule a decade ago, but a relatively orderly set of
January ruling party primaries point to calm rather than chaos.
 ""Suddenly the rest of Africa looks kind of good,"" said
Clifford Sacks, the Africa head of emerging market investment
bank Renaissance Capital.
 ""Sub-Saharan Africa is now becoming the least risky
oil-producing geographic region in Africa, and Nigeria now, on a
relative basis, becomes one of the most stable major oil
producers in the continent.""
 
 SPEED OF EGYPT RECOVERY KEY
 However, this relative revaluation of sub-Saharan political
risk looks unlikely to translate into an immediate shift in
investment flows, especially if Egypt recovers its poise sooner
rather than later.
 ""All of these events should be making investors understand
that South Africa is an oasis of stability and may be a good
investment destination -- as with a number of other countries in
the rest of Africa,"" said John Coulter, the Johannesburg-based
head of Africa for U.S. investment bank JP Morgan.
 ""Kenya went through a political crisis but their economy is
still viable and businesses are still functioning,"" he said.
""But the translation to investment dollars is incremental not
dramatic. People don't immediately just shift.""
 However, in the longer term if the energy and vigour of
Egypt's mobile phone revolutionaries wanes or meets military and
official obduracy, a more permanent gulf in investor attitudes
could open between the continent's north and fast-growing south.
 ""The general sense was that North Africa was always slightly
behind the curve in terms of political change,"" said John Green,
head of global business development for Cape Town-based Investec
Asset Management, which oversees $4 billion in Africa outside
South Africa.
 ""If Egypt plays out negatively, you could have a segregation
of 'I want to think about sub-Saharan Africa and north Africa
differently.'""

 By Walter Brandimarte and Blaise Robinson
 NEW YORK/PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - World stocks and the
euro fell on Thursday as a downgrade of Spain's credit added to
worries over the euro zone debt crisis, while an unexpected
Chinese trade deficit fueled global growth concerns.
 Brent oil prices  dipped below $115 a barrel on data
showing China posted in February its largest trade deficit in
seven years. The country's exports, a gauge of global economic
activity, suffered a larger-than-expected impact from the Lunar
New Year holiday. For details, see [ID:nTOE72903F]
 Copper prices also fell on data showing China's imports of
commodities declined. The retreat in oil prices was limited,
however, as forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
assaulted the eastern oil town of Ras Lanuf, sparking worries
about damage to the oil infrastructure. [ID:nLDE72900H]
 U.S. stocks opened with sharp losses as
higher-than-expected claims of unemployment benefits in the
United States added to the economic concerns.
 ""Overseas issues continue to play a role in U.S. markets.
The situation in Europe isn't complete, the market continues to
have concerns about sovereign credit,"" said Subodh Kumar, chief
investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto.
 ""Markets have been hoping that China would lead the
recovery, but when you put this (U.S.) data with slower growth
out of China, the idea that everything looks normal is going
away.""
 China exports grew in February from a year earlier well
short of forecasts.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 177.59 points,
or 1.45 percent, to 12,035.50, while the Standard & Poor's 500

The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> declined 44.12 points, or

 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top

 * PIMCO's move says more about its fund than mkt view
 * Fund managers see value in U.S. debt, especially TIPS
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - A tactical investment shift to
reduce government debt is gathering pace around the world, but
few major investors plan to follow PIMCO's decision to remove
all U.S. Treasury bonds from its flagship fund.
 Aside from the latest U.S. Federal Reserve's bond buying, or
""quantitative easing"", programme -- the June expiry of which
PIMCO fears could hammer the market -- demand for government
debt should persist due to stricter regulation, a scarcity of
top-rated assets and central bank reserve management.
 PIMCO, the world's biggest bond fund, said on Wednesday it
had dumped all of its U.S. government-related debt in its
flagship Total Return fund, becoming most negative on U.S.
government bonds since January 2009.
 That bearishness in itself is no great surprise as many
investors have been moving underweight U.S. and other sovereign
paper for several months as inflationary pressure has raised the
odds of interest rate rises in the developed economies.
 But the extreme nature of the positioning says more about
the nature of the fund involved than it does about the potential
for wholesale dumping of government debt worldwide.
 Funds which, unlike PIMCO's bellwether, do not have the
liberty of pursuing hedge fund-like absolute return strategies,
must hold some government bonds in their portfolios.
 ""If you are a pension fund, clearly you are running against
a benchmark and you have very strict tracking measures you are
following,"" said Sanjay Joshi, fixed income specialist at wealth
manager London & Capital.
 ""A global bond fund (without U.S. paper) would be nigh on
impossible.""
 Joost van Leenders, investment specialist at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, said his risk budget did not allow a
complete removal of government bonds from his portfolio.
 ""In our model portfolio, there is no regulatory limit, but
if we have a large underweight, it consumes a lot of our risk
budget,"" he said, adding that he was underweight in all
developed government bonds.
 Reuters asset allocation polls show investors held 34.2
percent of their portfolios in fixed income at the end of
February. Of this, just over half was in government-related
securities, down from last year's peak of 61.2 percent in May.
 Their underweight position in bonds stood at -1.2 in
February -- on a scale of -3 to +3 -- compared with -0.8 in
November when the Fed launched its $600 billion bond buying
programme. 
 
 INFLATION HEDGE
 Even among funds that allow zero allocation to any
government bonds, fund managers were unlikely to follow PIMCO's
move.
 Baring Asset Management and HSBC Global Asset Management,
for example, both see value in U.S. Treasuries, especially those
which are inflation-protected (TIPS).
 Percival Stanion, head of multi-asset strategy at Baring
Asset Management, has 9 percent in U.S. Treasuries, including 2
percent in inflation-protected paper. 
 His fund allows government bond holdings to fall to zero and
has no allocation to euro zone and UK government debt currently.
 ""Our view on bonds is that they have improved a little bit,
(as) yields have risen in the past few months. There has been
such a big selloff in bond yields in the past three months. U.S.
linkers specifically look better,"" Stanion said.
 Stanion also has 10 percent in Australian government bonds
as a hedge against his emerging market equity exposure.
 Charlie Morris, head of absolute returns at HSBC Global AM,
has steered completely clear of U.S. government paper, with the
exception of TIPS, in his sterling-denominated Wealth
Opportunity Fund.
 Elsewhere, he likes 30-year Treasuries , which
are yielding 4.6 percent, as a macro hedge that provides a
stream of returns that are not effected by short-term inflation
pressures.
 
 STRUCTURAL SUPPORT
 Stricter capital and liquidity rules under Basel III, which
force banks to hold a higher proportion of top quality capital
from 2013, are also set to raise the appeal of safe assets such
as U.S. government bonds.
 This is especially true in a world that is short of
top-quality, triple-A rated securities.
 Governments around the world were forced to issue debt to
bail out banks hit by the financial crisis, taking on private
sector risks on their balance sheets. As a result, their ratings
took a hit.
 Ireland, Spain and Iceland lost their triple-A ratings after
the crisis. Moody's said late last month that it could put the
U.S. triple-A credit rating under review for a downgrade.
 ""Banks, as part of their de-risking, are encouraged to buy
government bonds so there's natural demand there. Pension funds
certainly in the UK, and also in Europe, are planning to reduce
long-term investment risk,"" said Jeremy Beckwith, chief
investment officer at Kleinwort Benson.
 For a similar reason, central banks -- which globally
control $8 trillion of foreign exchange reserves -- will keep a
large chunk of their assets in liquid and safe government bonds,
especially in the United States.
 ""Credit risk has deteriorated in the whole world in the last
two years as budget deficits and debt ratios have gone up, so the
quality of almost everyone has declined. Few people have
triple-A status,"" Beckwith said.

 * Euro falls as euro zone fiscal woes outweigh rate view
 * Moody's downgrades Spain
 * U.S. data aids dollar by adding to risk aversion
(Recasts, updates prices, changes dateline, previous LONDON)
 NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday
after a cut to Spain's credit rating kept euro zone debt
problems in focus with the currency vulnerable to more downward
pressure in the coming weeks.
 Moody's downgraded Spain to Aa2 from Aa1 with a negative
outlook, although sovereign demand and technical support
buffered the currency against more intraday losses.
 The euro fell to a session low against the dollar after
disappointing U.S. jobless claims and international trade data
added to risk aversion by reminding investors of problems in
the global economy.
""The Spanish downgrade has shifted the focus back from
interest rate expectations to the euro fiscal house not being
in order, putting pressure on the euro,"" said John Doyle,
strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 In early New York trade, the euro traded at $1.3817, down
0.7 percent, with the session low at $1.3795 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 According to traders, Middle East sovereign accounts were
said to be buying near the low, while bids from official Asian
names were seen about $1.3800 and lower.
 Technical analysts saw trendline support for the euro
around $1.3775, drawn from lows in January and February, but a
fall below that open the door to more losses.
 London-based UBS FX analyst Geoffrey Yu said the Spanish
downgrade showed the euro zone's debt crisis is far from over.
He added that investors have yet to fully acknowledge the risk
of Europe's inability to agree on a framework for a debt rescue
fund this month.
 Analysts said the possibility the European Central Bank may
raise interest rates next month was containing a further slide
in the euro for now.
 But they argued the euro could suffer if investors start to
price in the prospect that ongoing monetary tightening by the
ECB is unlikely, given that the euro zone economy is still
struggling to recover.
 ""The net impact of rising sovereign fears for the euro is a
near-term negative,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""However, our core
view is unchanged: euro should trend higher, interrupted by
periods of sovereign fear induced weakness, but that it should
close this year at higher levels than it is currently trading
and next year at still higher levels.""
 RESCUE FUND CONCERNS
 The euro's decline pushed it further from a four-month high
of $1.4036 hit Monday after last week's hawkish comments on
inflation from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet. He hinted at
an interest rate rise in the euro zone as soon as April.
 The time spent above $1.40 was brief, with market players
expecting the focus to be on fiscal issues in the coming weeks,
when European leaders and finance ministers meet to tackle debt
problems, starting with a euro zone summit on Friday.
 Against the yen, the dollar edged up 0.3 percent to 83 yen
after climbing to its highest since Feb. 22 on EBS.
 The Australian dollar fell after data showed China swung to
a surprise trade deficit in February of $7.3 billion, its
largest in seven years.
 The numbers stirred worries that China's growth could slow
and affect countries such as Australia, which has benefited
from China's expansion. The Aussie dollar was down around 0.8
percent at $1.0025.
 Sterling traded 0.7 percent lower at $1.6084 after the Bank
of England held interest rates at a record low of 0.5 percent,
as widely expected.

 * Putin floats idea of visa-free regime with U.S.
 
 By Steve Gutterman
 MOSCOW, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden
told Vladimir Putin on Thursday the United States was determined
to strengthen economic ties with Russia, but gently rebuffed the
prime minister's call for visa-free travel between the nations.
 Biden, on a visit to Moscow to keep up the momentum in
President Barack Obama's ""reset"" with Russia after two years of
improving ties, also met separately with Kremlin opponents and
rights activists.
 Putin said bilateral trade was up 29 percent last year and
big U.S. companies are successful in Russia. ""Relations between
our countries are developing quite well,"" he told Biden as they
sat down along with a handful of other officials for talks.
 But he added it would be a ""historic step"" if the Cold War
foes scrapped visa requirements for travellers between the two
countries -- similar to an effort Moscow has been pushing, so
far unsuccessfully, with the European Union.
 An agreement with the United States on visa-free travel
""would break all the old stereotypes between Russia and the
United States"" and ""turn an important page"", said Putin, who
suggested Biden could use his power as vice president and clout
with Congress to advance the idea.
 Putin's ambitious call for visa-free travel appeared aimed
to underscore what Russians say is lingering American mistrust
of Russia that hinders a complete reconciliation between the
Cold War adversaries.
 Biden parried by saying: ""In case you haven't noticed,
there's a real difference between president and vice president.""
 ""But the very good news is that the president and I agree
100 percent on the need to establish closer and closer relations
with Russia.""
 ""Now is the time to focus on the economy,"" he said.
 Biden, who met with U.S. and Russian business leaders on
Wednesday, stressed that while Russia's market was far smaller
than others such as China, it remained attractive for U.S.
investors.
 ""So let me tell you why we are here: Russia has the best
engineers in the world. Russia has intellectual capital. Russia
is a great nation,"" he told journalists.
 Recent U.S.-Russian deals have been done in the energy,
food, aerospace, agricultural machinery, and hi-tech sectors.
 The centrepiece of improved relations, the New START nuclear
arms control treaty signed by Obama and Medvedev in April 2010,
entered into force last month.
 Obama's White House and the Kremlin are eager to prevent the
relationship drifting as elections approach in both countries.
 Putin, president from 2000-2008 and still seen as Russia's
paramount leader after steering Medvedev into the Kremlin when
he faced term limits, has hinted he may use a March 2012
election to return to the presidency.
 Analysts say the benefits to the United States from the
""reset"" -- such as the arms treaty and increased Russian
pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme -- would not have
been achieved without Putin's approval.
 But Medvedev has presented a more cooperative face to the
United States than Putin, a longtime KGB officer in Soviet era,
whose relationship with Obama has seemed visibly cooler than
Medvedev's.
 Biden praised Medvedev's ""personal leadership"" in a meeting
on Wednesday.
 The talks with Putin on Thursday were sandwiched between
separate meetings with civil society leaders and leaders of
Russia's beleaguered liberal political opposition, sending a
message that the United States is not ignoring critics who
accuse Russia's leaders of curtailing human rights.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2011 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Jan trade gap widens on surging imports," WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit
widened much more than expected in January to $46.3 billion, as
surging imports of oil, capital goods and cars overpowered
record exports, data on Thursday showed.
 Analysts had expected the trade gap to grow moderately to
$41.5 billion, from a revised estimate of $40.3 billion in
December. The closely watched trade gap with China also widened
in January.
 Led by higher oil prices, U.S. imports of goods and
services leapt 5.2 percent in January to $214.1 billion for the
largest month-to-month gain since March 1993, the Commerce
Department report showed.
The strong growth was a sign of improved U.S. demand, but
the bigger-than-expected gap could prompt analysts to scale
back their estimates of first -quarter U.S. economic growth.
 The average price for imported oil soared to $84.34 per
barrel, the highest since October 2008, and imports from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also rose
to the highest since that month.
 Imports of capital goods, such as industrial machinery,
engines and medicinal equipment, hit a record $41.7 billion
while imports of foods, feeds and beverages were a record $8.5
billion.
Car imports were the highest since February 2008.
U.S. exports of goods and services grew 2.7 percent to a
record $167.7 billion, with both exports of goods and exports
of services at record highs.
The previous record of $165.7 billion was set in July 2008,
just before the global financial crisis which caused world
trade to plummet.
Despite export growth to the rest of the world, U.S. exports
to China fell more than 20 perent in January to $8.1 billion
while U.S. imports from China grew slightly to $31.4 billion.
That resulted in a bilateral U.S. trade deficit of $23.3
billion during the month that Chinese President Hu Jintao was
in the United States for talks with President Barack Obama.
The trade deficit with China is a sore point in relations and
both sides have promised steps to bring trade more into
balance.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2011 08:32AM ET</span>",Rift over export zones underscores India policy muddle," By Matthias Williams 
 NEW DELHI, March 10 (Reuters) - India's finance and trade
ministries are locked in a dispute over a tax on export hubs
announced in last week's budget, adding to a sense of regulatory
uncertainty in the crisis-hit New Delhi government.	
 The trade ministry wants to strike down an 18.5 percent duty
on book profits in so-called Special Economic Zones (SEZs), hubs
with long tax holidays that were set up in the footsteps of
fellow Asian giant China to foster manufacturing growth.	
 Trade Minister Anand Sharma expressed ""surprise"" at the
budget announcement made by his counterpart in the finance
ministry, Pranab Mukherjee, and wrote a letter in protest amid
worries of an exodus of developers in the zones.	
 On Thursday, the top bureaucrat in the trade ministry, Rahul
Khullar, said the tax would likely act as a brake on rapid
growth in the zones and send the wrong signal about India's
investment climate.	
 ""Exports have grown at a huge clip from SEZs because people
have made investments, because people have received assurances
that there will be tax breaks,"" Khullar told reporters.	
 ""If the MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax) ends up altogether
discouraging both foreign and domestic investment, what are we
achieving?"" he said. 
 ""The levy of MAT acts as a disincentive in two ways. One is
that the rules of the game are changed midstream, so somebody is
going to turn around and say it's not fair,"" Khullar said.	
 ""The second and far more serious implication is this.
Supposing you are a prospective investor, wanting either to set
up an SEZ or invest in a SEZ by establishing a unit, you are not
going to do it.""	
 India rolled out the policy of SEZs hoping to create
millions of new jobs, attract investment and boost manufacturing
through tax breaks and fiscal incentives.	
 New Delhi wants SEZs to raise India's manufacturing output
to catch up with years of IT- and services-driven economic boom,
as Asia's third-largest economy returns to near double digit
growth seen before the 2008 financial crisis.	
 The dispute comes as a series of graft scandals create a
sense of regulatory uncertainty in the country, especially in
the telecoms sector, which has come under intense scrutiny after
faulty allocation processes were said to have cost the
government upto $39 billion in lost revenue.	
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has had to fend off
accusations that he was running a ""lame duck"" government after
months of corruption scandals paralysed parliament, rattled
investors and slowed the pace of economic reforms.	
 The merit of the zones has been hotly debated since their
inception, both on their economic performance and on the social
cost of land acquisition needed to create profitable SEZs in a
country with hundreds of millions of rural poor.	
 Rights activists have long called for the zones to be
scrapped amid violent protests. The finance ministry says tax
breaks to exporters in the zones have drained revenue.	
 Pranab Mukherjee in his budget speech on Feb. 28 said the
new tax on the zones would make the corporate tax burden fairer.	
 The zones have attracted firms such as Reliance ,
which set up the world's largest oil refining complex in an SEZ
in the western state of Gujarat, as well as cellphone giant
Nokia and sporting goods maker Adidas .	
 Exports from the zones will likely rise to around $70-75
billion in the current financial year ending March, up from
roughly $55 billion last year, Khullar said.

 * Moody's sees banks capital shortfall at 40-50 bln euros
 * Cuts rating one notch to Aa2, still two above Portugal
 * Doubts Spain able to ensure regional deficit compliance
 * Euro weakens versus dollar

(Adds Fitch statement, Zapatero comment)
 By Elisabeth O'Leary
 MADRID, March 10 (Reuters) - Moody's downgraded Spain's
sovereign debt rating by one notch on Thursday and warned of
further cuts to come as it expects bank restructuring will cost
more than twice what the government expects.
 ""(Moody's) believes there is a meaningful risk that the
eventual cost of the recapitalisation effort could considerably
exceed the government's current projections,"" the ratings agency
said in a statement.
 The cut in the rating -- to Aa2 from Aa1 -- drove the euro
to session lows against the dollar and the premium investors
charge for Spanish 10-year debt instead of German Bunds expanded
to its widest point in two months at 232 basis points before
narrowing again to 226.
 The Bank of Spain will release its own report on banks'
capital needs after markets close on Thursday.
 The European Central Bank backed Spain's planned measures to
shore up the sector, while Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero defended Spain's economic fundamentals as reasonable.
 The government and central bank have forecast no more than
20 billion euros would be needed to recapitalise weak banks.
 But Moody's said the overall cost was likely to be nearer
40-50 billion euros. In a more stressed scenario
recapitalisation needs could even rise to around 110-120 billion
euros, it said.
 Ratings agency Fitch later estimated at 38 billion euros the
shortfall in Spain's banking system in a base-case stress test
it conducted separately.
 Moody's still rates Spain as a high grade investment
proposition. By way of comparison, the agency rates Portugal two
notches lower and Greece far down with junk status.
 Spanish sovereign debt prices had stabilised after months of
volatility, as investors became less concerned that Spain could
follow Greece and Ireland in needing a financial bailout from
the European Union.
 A bank bill at the higher end of forecasts could change
that.
 ""I think there are a lot of uncertainties about the bank
shortfall, but given the cost of bailouts in countries like
Ireland, the forecast given by the government looks low,"" said
Ben May, economist at Capital Economics.
 European shares slid as the downgrade raised concerns about
the health of peripheral euro zone economies. The FTSEurofirst
300 index of top European shares was down 0.55 percent at
1,138.5 points.
 
 GOVERNMENT SURPRISED
 ""We are surprised that Moody's has taken this decision
before knowing the details of the (Bank of Spain's) report on
the recapitalisation of the Spanish financial sector,"" Spanish
Treasury Director Soledad Nunez told Reuters.
 She said Moody's had had until March 15 to take its final
decision after putting Spain on credit watch on Dec 15.
 The Moody's rating is now in line with the Standard & Poor's
rating of AA. The other major ratings agency, Fitch, has a
rating one notch higher, AA+, but last Friday revised its
outlook on Spain to negative.
 A Fitch spokesman said the agency does not specify a
deadline to act on its revision on Spain's outlook but said it
would be a ""relatively short period"".
 Moody's also noted that nine of Spain's 17 autonomous
regions have breached budget deficit targets. 
 ""This casts doubts over the ability of the central
government to exercise sufficient control over the regions to
ensure compliance with deficit targets,"" it said.
 But it said it still believed Spain's debt was sustainable
and its baseline assumptions did not anticipate a need for the
Spanish government to ask for an EU bailout.
 The European Central Bank has signalled it will raise
interest rates in April to combat inflation in the euro zone.
 Spain is vulnerable to the tightening cycle because of its
high percentage of floating rate mortgages, low economic growth
and fragile banking sectors.
 Many of its banks have been blighted by huge loans to
property developers, many of whom went bust after Spain's real
estate bubble burst.
 Measures taken by the government to force savings banks,
known as cajas, to seek private capital have helped calm market
fears, and funding costs for the sovereign have shrunk since the
beginning of the year.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2011 08:08AM ET</span>",Greece asks EU to take urgent steps on rating agencies," ATHENS, March 10 (Reuters) - Greece on Thursday asked EU and
ECB leaders to urgently address problems created by rating
agencies for countries struggling with debt crises, just days
after Moody's downgraded Athens by three notches.
 Such ""unjustified"" moves by rating agencies can hinder
Greece and other troubled countries from regaining access to
financial markets, the finance minister said in a letter to
Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker, EU monetary affairs
commissioner Olli Rehn, EU's financial services chief Michel
Barnier and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet.
 ""Rating agencies must be regulated effectively at a European
and world level,"" George Papaconstantinou said in the letter,
which was released by the Finance Ministry. ""This is an issue
that must be dealth with urgently by eurogroup and ecofin.""
 On Monday, Moody's slashed Greece's credit rating by three
notches citing an increased default risk, increasing pressure on
euro zone leaders to ease repayment terms on bailout loans to
Athens.
 Greek debt was downgraded to B1 from Ba1 -- lower than Egypt
-- raising the price of insuring Greek, Spanish and Portuguese
debt against default and Greek bond spreads over German bunds.
 The government issued an angry protest, saying reports by
the EU and IMF, which have extended Greece a 110 billion euro
bailout, have been positive on progress.
 ""Such unjustified and imbalanced decisions could become
self-fulfilling prophecies,"" Papaconstantinou said. ""They can
hinder the course of Greece and other countries in a similar
position as we try to regain access to international markets.""
 Moody's, the first of the three main rating agencies to cut
Greece so low, said risks stemmed from a revenue shortfall and
slow reforms of healthcare and state-owned companies.
[ID:nLDE7260EL].
 Papaconstantinou said Moody's downgrade revealed the
""distorted incentives and lack of accountability"" on the part of
rating agencies and slammed them for missing the signs of the
2008 financial crisis.

 By Blaise Robinson
 PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - European stocks and the euro
fell on Thursday as Moody's downgraded Spain, reigniting worries
over the euro zone debt crisis ahead of the bloc's summit and
prompting investors to turn to safer bets such as Bunds.
 Brent crude, which has gained 13 percent over the past three
weeks, dipped below $115 on Thursday, but the retreat was
limited as forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
launched an assault on the eastern Libyan oil town of Ras Lanuf,
sparking worries about long-term damage to the country's oil
infrastructure.
 Investors were also fretting about surprisingly weak Chinese
trade data that hit Asian stocks and copper prices.
 China swung to a trade deficit in February of $7.3 billion
-- its largest in seven years -- as the Lunar New Year holiday
dealt a sharper blow to export activity than had been expected.
 ""China's trade figures have been a shocker, setting the tone
in Asia's trading session. Add to that Spain's credit downgrade
and oil prices that aren't retreating, and the glass is now half
empty,"" said Lionel Jardin, head of institutional sales at
Global Equities in Paris.
 Moody's downgraded Spain to Aa2 from Aa1 with a negative
outlook and warned of further cuts, saying the country's plans
to clean up the battered banking sector will cost more than the
government expects and add to its debt burden.
 The move comes a few days after Moody's steep three-notch
downgrade of Greece, fuelling negative sentiment towards
struggling euro zone sovereign borrowers on the eve of a summit
of the currency bloc.
 ""If speculators really hit Portugal hard there would appear
to be an increased possibility that Spain will be put back under
the spotlight, but we don't think Spain will need to be bailed
out,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
 The euro hit the day's low around $1.3805, although
sovereign demand and technical support buffered the currency
against more intraday losses.
 The yield gap between 10-year Spanish yields and equivalent
German Bunds was 5 basis points wider on the day at 228 bps,
after rising to 232 bps earlier.
 Negative sentiment in the periphery has pushed investors to
seek safer trades, and Bund futures rose 27 ticks to 121.86. The
10-year Bund yield fell 3.2 basis points to 3.706 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down
0.7 percent, hitting a six-week low, while Spain's benchmark
index IBEX 35 was down 1.3 percent at a near two-month low.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index
were down 0.7 percent.
 U.S. stock index futures were also in the red, suggesting a
weak start for Wall Street.
 ""The recent geopolitical events that have boosted oil prices
are nothing to reassure retail investors, who have been shunning
equities,"" said Philippe Marchessaux, CEO of BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, which has 546 billion euros ($754 billion)
under management.
 ""But at the same time, when you look at corporate results
and equity valuations, stocks are tremendously cheap.""
 The broad MSCI world equity index carries a forward
price-to-earnings ratio of 12.2, well below a 20-year average of
16.6, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
 In the UK, the FTSE 100 index extended its losses and
sterling slipped in afternoon trading after the Bank of
England's Monetary Policy Committee left interest rates on hold
at 0.5 percent, as expected.

 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept
interest rates at a record low on Thursday, reluctant to
jeopardise a fragile economic recovery and hopeful the recent
surge in inflation will prove temporary.
 All but one of the 63 economists polled by Reuters last week
had predicted rates would stay at 0.5 percent. However, with
inflation double the central bank's 2 percent target and still
rising, most expect a rate rise later this year.
 Money markets show a 70 percent chance the BoE will raise
rates by a quarter percentage point in May and are fully pricing
such a move by the middle of the year.
 The European Central Bank, dealing with an inflation rate
nearly half the level of Britain's, has already signalled that
an interest rate rise in imminent.
 Three of Britain's nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee
voted to raise interest rates in February, so it would only take
two to switch camps to get a majority in favour of higher rates.
The bank gives no statement on its reasons when it keeps rates
on hold and minutes from the meeting -- including how the
committee voted -- will not be published until later this month.
 ""With the committee expected to begin tightening over the
coming months, and a hike requiring the support of just two more
members, UK markets look set to remain jittery,"" said Philip
Shaw, an economist at Investec.
 
 RECOVERY HEADWINDS
 The main argument keeping the BoE on hold is the weakness of
Britain's recovery and the fear that the government's austerity
drive will throw up stiff headwinds over the coming year.
 Unlike its main trading partners, Britain's economy lurched
into reverse at the end of 2010, contracting by 0.6 percent in
the fourth quarter.
 While the country's manufacturing sector is enjoying a
strong rebound, the services sector, which accounts for
three-quarters of the economy, is struggling.
 Home Retail, Britain's biggest household goods retailer,
delivered a profit warning on Thursday, raising fears of a major
downturn in consumer spending.
 The government announced the biggest public spending cuts in
a generation shortly after being elected last year, but much of
the pain from these measures will not kick in until April, the
start of the new fiscal year.
 ""The majority of MPC members likely decided that higher
interest rates were an extra handicap that the economy could do
without for now at least,"" said Howard Archer at Global Insight.
 ""The key question is will this prove to be a temporary
reprieve on interest rates or will the Bank of England hold fire
for some time to come?""
 
 MAY HIKE?
 Most investors believe the BoE will want to see how the
economy fared in the first quarter of this year before acting.
This means a rate rise is unlikely to come before May.
 There remains a good deal of uncertainty however. Tensions
in north Africa and the Middle East have pushed up oil prices,
driving up inflation but also weighing on global growth.
 ""The Monetary Policy Committee remains caught on the horns
of a dilemma,"" said Robert Gardner, chief economist at the
Nationwide Building Society. 
 ""Growth is still disappointingly weak, while inflation is
already twice the target level and likely to head higher, with
oil above $100 a barrel and January's VAT hike still filtering
through.""
 UK interest rates have stood at 0.5 percent since March 2009
when the BoE slashed rates to an all-time low and embarked on an
unprecedented programme of quantitative easing.
 However, divisions on the monetary policy committee have
deepened in recent months and the replacement of arch-hawk
Andrew Sentance with Goldman Sachs' economist Ben Broadbent in
June adds to uncertainty.
 Minutes to this week's BoE policy meeting will be published
on March 23, the same day as the government's Budget, and will
be closely scrutinised.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday after
a cut to Spain's credit rating reminded investors that euro zone
debt problems will continue to haunt the currency, keeping it
vulnerable to more downward pressure in the coming weeks.
 The euro hit the day's low around $1.3805 after Moody's
downgraded Spain to Aa2 from Aa1 with a negative outlook,
although sovereign demand and technical support buffered the
currency against more intraday losses.
 Near-term Fibonacci support was seen at the session trough,
around the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's rally in
January-February, but its retreat from the psychologically key
$1.40 level this week ultimately points to more euro downside.
 UBS FX analyst Geoffrey Yu said the Spanish downgrade showed
the euro zone's debt crisis is far from over, and that investors
have yet to fully acknowledge the risk of Europe's inability to
agree a framework for a debt rescue fund this month.
 Analysts said the possibility the European Central Bank may
raise interest rates next month was containing a further slide
in the euro for now.
 But they argued the euro could suffer if investors start to
price in the prospect ongoing monetary tightening by the ECB is
unlikely given that the euro zone economy is still struggling to
recover.
 ""If we start to move down towards $1.37 and $1.36, it will
show that the move to $1.40 was clearly unsustainable,"" Yu said.
""Fast money will pull out and we could move much lower.""
 By 1223 GMT, the euro traded at $1.3830, down half a percent
on the day. Traders said that Mideast sovereign accounts picked
up the euro after it hit the day's low, while bids from official
Asian names were seen around $1.3800 and lower.
 Technical analysts saw trendline support for the euro around
$1.3775, drawn from lows hit in January and February, but a fall
below that open the door to more losses.
 The euro's fall pushed the dollar index higher to trade with
gains of around 0.3 percent on the day at 77.023. Against the
yen, it edged up 0.2 percent to 82.92 yen.
 
 RESCUE FUND CONCERNS
 The single currency fell further from a four-month high of
$1.4036 hit on Monday after last week's hawkish comments on
inflation from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, which hinted
at an interest rate rise in the euro zone as soon as April.
 The time spent above $1.40 was brief, with market players
expecting the focus to be on fiscal issues in the coming weeks,
when European leaders and finance ministers will hold a series
of meetings to tackle debt problems, starting with a euro zone
summit on Friday.
 ""Today's downgrade may be just the type of kick that the EU
authorities need to come up with a credible, long-term solution
to the debt crisis,"" said Kathleen Brooks, strategist at
Forex.com.
 ""After all, Spain is the fourth largest economy in the
currency bloc and its financial collapse could throw the future
of the EZ into doubt.""
 Investors are sceptical over the potential for progress on
boosting the lending capacity of Europe's bailout vehicle, the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). The deadline for
the fund's framework looms on March 24-25.
 The Australian dollar fell after data showed China swung to
a surprise trade deficit in February of $7.3 billion, its
largest in seven years.
 The numbers stirred worries that China's growth could slow
and affect countries such as Australia, which has benefited from
China's expansion. The Aussie dollar was down around 0.6 percent
at $1.0030. 
 Sterling traded 0.3 percent lower at $1.6150, having slipped
a touch after the Bank of England held interest rates at a
record los 0.5 percent, as widely expected.

 By Elisabeth O'Leary
 MADRID, March 10 (Reuters) - Moody's downgraded Spain's
sovereign debt rating by one notch on Thursday and warned of
further cuts to come due to fears that bank restructuring will
cost more than twice what the government expects.
 ""(Moody's) believes there is a meaningful risk that the
eventual cost of the recapitalisation effort could considerably
exceed the government's current projections,"" the ratings agency
said in a statement.
 The cut in the rating -- to Aa2 from Aa1 -- drove the euro
to session lows against the dollar and the premium investors
charge for Spanish 10-year debt instead of German Bunds expanded
to its widest point in two months at 232 basis points before
narrowing again to 226.
 The Bank of Spain will release its own report on banks'
capital needs after markets close on Thursday.
 The government and central bank have forecast no more than
20 billion euros would be needed to recapitalise weak banks.
 But Moody's said the overall cost was likely to be nearer
40-50 billion euros. In a more stressed scenario
recapitalisation needs could even rise to around 110-120 billion
euros, it said.
 Moody's still rates Spain as a high grade investment
proposition. By way of comparison, the agency rates Portugal two
notches lower and Greece far down with junk status.
 Spanish sovereign debt prices had stabilised recently after
months of volatility, as investors became less concerned that
Spain could follow Greece and Ireland in needing a financial
bailout from the European Union.
 A bank bill at the higher end of forecasts could change
that.
 ""I think there are a lot of uncertainties about the bank
shortfall, but given the cost of bailouts in countries like
Ireland, the forecast given by the government looks low,"" said
Ben May, economist at Capital Economics.
 European shares slid as the downgrade raised concerns about
the health of peripheral euro zone economies. The FTSEurofirst
300 index of top European shares was down 0.65 percent at
1,137.3 points.
 
 GOVERNMENT SURPRISED
 ""We are surprised that Moody's has taken this decision
before knowing the details of the (Bank of Spain's) report on
the recapitalisation of the Spanish financial sector,"" Spanish
Treasury Director Soledad Nunez told Reuters.
 She said Moody's had had until March 15 to take its final
decision after putting Spain on credit watch on Dec 15.
 The Moody's rating is now in line with the Standard & Poor's
rating of AA. The other major ratings agency, Fitch, has a
rating one notch higher, AA+, but last Friday revised its
outlook on Spain to negative.
 Fitch and S&P declined to comment on the Moody's downgrade.
A Fitch spokesman said the agency does not specify a deadline to
act on its revision on Spain's outlook but said it is a
""relatively short period"".
 Moody's also noted that nine of Spain's 17 autonomous
regions have breached budget deficit targets. 
 ""This casts doubts over the ability of the central
government to exercise sufficient control over the regions to
ensure compliance with deficit targets,"" it said.
 But it said it still believed Spain's debt was sustainable
and its baseline assumptions did not anticipate a need for the
Spanish government to ask for an EU bailout.
 The European Central Bank has signalled it will raise
interest rates in April to combat inflation in the euro zone.
 Spain is vulnerable to the tightening cycle because of its
high percentage of floating rate mortgages, low economic growth
and fragile banking sectors.
 Many of its banks have been blighted by huge loans to
property developers, many of whom went bust after Spain's real
estate bubble burst.
 Measures taken by the government to force savings banks,
known as cajas, to seek private capital have helped calm market
fears, and funding costs for the sovereign have shrunk since the
beginning of the year.

unexpectedly fell sharply in January, data showed on Thursday,
giving a weak start to the year that contrasted with robust
increases in output in France and Germany.
 Italy's output sank 1.5 percent from the previous month,
confounding average expectations of a 0.5 percent increase in a
Reuters poll of analysts and compared with a downwardly revised
0.2 percent increase in December.
 Data this week have generally painted a robust picture for
European industry, much of which was hit by unusually bad
weather in December. 
 Italy's fall contrasted markedly with a 1.8 percent monthly
rise in German output in January, which met analyst
expectations, and a forecast-beating 1 percent rise in France.
 ""It's a very negative figure, and surprising when compared
to France and Germany,"" said Paolo Mameli from Intesa Sanpaolo,
adding that it may lead to a downward revision of his 0.3
percent Italian growth forecast for the first quarter.
 ""We are at risk of another quarter similar to the sluggish
fourth quarter,"" he said. Italy's economy grew just 0.1 percent
in the last three months of 2010, according to preliminary data.
 German industrial output bounced back in January from a
plunge caused by icy winter weather late last year, rising by
1.8 percent on the month in seasonally adjusted terms after a
revised 0.6 percent drop in December.
 Figures earlier on Thursday showed French industry output
rose 1.0 percent in January after a revised 0.2 percent rise the
month before.
 ""While part of the increase should be seen as payback for
weak production in December when adverse weather conditions were
at play, the underlying picture is also one of strengthening
growth"" Joost Beaumont, economist at ABN AMRO, said of the
French figures.
 Outside the euro zone, British manufacturing output rose 1.0
percent month-on-month in January, more than reversing a 0.1
percent fall in December, and the strongest rate of growth since
March 2010.
 Italy's figures will weigh on aggregate output data in the
euro zone, which is due on March 14. The median forecast in a
Reuters survey conducted prior to the latest national data
pointed to a 0.7 percent monthly rise.
 Germany, France and Italy make up at least two-thirds of the
euro zone's economic output.
 On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, Italian output in
January was up 0.6 percent, compared to a revised 5.6 percent
increase in December.

rely on international trade rules, rather than protectionist
tools, to ensure that foreign bids for EU companies are not
backed by state aid, the EU's antitrust chief said on Thursday.
 EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia's comment came
amid rising debate about whether and how the 27-country group
should vet a wave of overseas takeover bids for European assets,
some of which are seen as ""crown jewels"".
 Concerns over foreign acquisitions of Europe's industrial
champions intensifed last year when Chinese company Xinmao made
a bid for Dutch cablemaker Draka, the principal automotive cable
supplier of Airbus.
 Antonio Tajani and Michel Barnier, EU commissioners in
charge of industry and the single market, recently wrote to EU
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, suggesting that the EU
should consider a centralised body to review foreign bids on
strategic grounds.
 Such centralised committees exist in the United States,
Canada, Japan, China and Australia.
 ""Of course, we must remain vigilant (for) state support
granted for the purpose of making acquisitions -- whether it
benefits EU or foreign companies,"" Almunia told an International
Bar Association conference.
 He said to this end, it was crucial to use the right tools.
 ""We should rely on the WTO rules and on Free Trade
Agreements, such as the one with Korea, to prevent illegitimate
investment subsidies used for the purpose of making
acquisitions,"" Almunia said.
 ""And this will benefit our own interest ... If the EU plays

 MUNICH, March 10 (Reuters) - German industrial gases maker
Linde AG signaled its confidence by boosting its dividend and
forecasting core profit growing by a third through 2014, after
it hit a record last year on cost cuts and brisk sales to Asia.
The world's no.2 industrial gases group after Air Liquide
said it aims to grow operating profit to at least 4 billion
euros ($5.6 billion) in 2014, underlining its optimism for the
future and reflecting its expanding footprint in emerging
markets.
 For 2010 core profit rose almost 23 percent to 2.93 billion
euros ($4.1 billion), leading Linde to say on Thursday it would
pay a full-year dividend of 2.20 euros a share, up 22 percent
from a year earlier and well above analysts' expectations.
 ""We will remain on our current path, looking to the future
with complete confidence,"" Chief Executive Wolfgang Reitzle
said.
 Linde shares firmed 1 percent to 113.75 euros by 0903 GMT
after rising as high as 114.20, their highest since early
January. The blue-chip DAX index was down 1 percent.
 Linde's outlook echoed upbeat comments from rivals Air
Liquide, whose net profit last year rose 14.1 percent, and
Praxair, largest industrial gases supplier in North America,
which gave a bullish outlook in January. 
 LEADER IN CHINA 
 Linde's main customers are in the steel and chemical sectors
but the company also supplies gases used to process solar cells,
make LCD flat screens and lift the giant helium character
balloons of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
 Its margins were boosted by cost cuts and Linde sees another
150 to 200 million euros in cuts this year, to reap savings of
up to 800 million by 2012. 
 Linde says it has a leading position in the Chinese gases
market, supplying LED, semiconductors and photovoltaic
producers.
 Last year, it won contracts to build air separation units
for steelmaker TISCO in China, supply technology for South
Korea's Posco's synthetic natural gas plant and install a carbon
dioxide plant in Malaysia.
Linde trades at around 15.7 times estimated 12-month forward
earnings per share, a slight discount to Air Liquide's 16.7 and
Praxair's 17.7, according to Starmine, which weights analyst
views by their track records.

before knowing the details of the (Bank of Spain's) report on
the recapitalisation of the Spanish financial sector,"" Spanish
Treasury Director Soledad Nunez told Reuters.
 She said Moody's had had until March 15 to take its final
decision after putting Spain on credit watch on Dec 15.
 The Moody's rating is now in line with the Standard & Poor's
rating of AA. The other major ratings agency, Fitch, has a
rating one notch higher, AA+, but last Friday revised its
outlook on Spain to negative.
 Moody's also noted that nine of Spain's 17 autonomous
regions have breached budget deficit targets. 
 ""This casts doubts over the ability of the central
government to exercise sufficient control over the regions to
ensure compliance with deficit targets,"" it said.
 The European Central Bank has signalled it will raise
interest rates in April to combat inflation in the euro zone.
 Spain is vulnerable to the tightening cycle because of its
high percentage of floating rate mortgages, low economic growth
and fragile banking sectors.
 Many of its banks have been blighted by huge loans to
property developers, many of whom went bust after Spain's real
estate bubble burst.
 Measures taken by the government to force savings banks,
known as cajas, to seek private capital have helped calm market
fears, and funding costs for the sovereign have shrunk since the
beginning of the year.

 (adds details)
 MADRID, March 10 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's cut
Spain's sovereign debt rating one notch on Thursday and warned
of further cuts due to fears that bank restructuring will likely
cost more than twice what the government expects.
 ""(Moody's) believes there is a meaningful risk that the
eventual cost of the recapitalization effort could considerably
exceed the government's current projections,"" it said in a
statement.
 Moody's still rates Spain -- one of the countries now in the
firing line in Europe's debt crisis -- as a high grade
investment proposition. By way of comparison, the agency rates
Portugal two notches lower and Greece far down with junk status.
 The ratings agency said the overall cost of recapitalising
struggling banks was likely to be nearer to 40 billion euros,
double the government's estimate. In a more stressed scenario
recapitalization needs could even rise to around 110 to 120
billion euros, it said.
 The cut in the rating -- to Aa2 from Aa1 -- drove the euro
to session lows against the dollar and the premium investors
charge for Spanish 10-year debt instead of German Bunds widened
9 basis points on the day to 232 bps.
 ""This is clearly negative. I'm not sure up to what point,
but it will certainly impact the banks. Obviously the direct
consequence is that it will be harder and more expensive (for
banks) to access financing,"" said Juan Rodriguez Rey, an analyst
at Banco Sabadell.
 Moody's also noted that nine of the country's 17 autonomous
regions breached budget deficit targets. 
 ""This casts doubts over the ability of the central
government to exercise sufficient control over the regions to
ensure compliance with deficit targets,"" it said.

(Adds economist quote, background)
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - German exports unexpectedly
fell 1 percent in January, data showed on Thursday, in a slight
setback for the key sector of Europe's largest economy.
 The trade surplus fell to 11.8 billion euros from a revised
14.2 billion the month before, seasonally adjusted data from the
Federal Statistics Office showed.
 Economists remained upbeat, although they had forecast a
surplus of 13.2 billion euros and had expected exports to rise
0.7 percent.
 ""Despite today's drop, exports should remain a reliable
source for growth,"" said Carsten Brzeski from ING. ""Demand from
other euro zone countries is stronger than expected, despite
fiscal austerity, and the strengthening U.S. economy should also
bring a welcome boost to German exports.""
 Germany has recovered faster than expected from a recession
in 2009 that was its deepest since World War Two, and by the
fourth quarter of last year it was growing 4 percent
year-on-year.
 The trade figures follow a run of strong data that have
suggested Germany's economic recovery is intact and broadening
at a time when some euro zone peers are struggling under the
burden of a sovereign debt crisis.
 Ratings agency Moody's cut Spain's sovereign credit rating
by a notch to Aa2 on Thursday and warned of further cuts.
 Domestic demand fuelled a stronger-than-expected rise in
German industrial orders in January.
 Germans' appetite for goods from abroad grew more than
expected in the month, the trade data showed, with imports
rising 2.3 percent from a month earlier.
 Should imports continue to grow, it could bring a welcome
boost to Germany's euro zone partners, who sometimes complain
Berlin is not doing enough to help domestic consumption.
 On Wednesday, the BGA trade association's chief Anton
Boerner said that German exports would rise nominally by up to 9
percent to 1.046 trillion euros this year and imports would grow
by 12 percent to 903 billion, exceeding pre-economic crisis
levels..
 Car-maker Daimler said last week it expects first-quarter
vehicle sales to grow significantly after it sold 16.6 percent
more cars in the first two months of 2011 than a year earlier.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss	
 TOKYO, March 10 - The euro fell on Thursday, with further
pullbacks seen likely, as worries about how Europe will address
its fiscal problems offset expectations of an upcoming rate hike
by the European Central Bank. 
 The single European currency extended its losses after
Moody's downgraded Spain's rating to Aa2 from Aa1 with a
negative outlook. 
 Technical strategists said the euro's consolidation from
Monday's four-month peak at $1.4036 is still in progress and a
deeper retreat cannot be ruled out. 
 Investors are looking ahead to a European policy makers'
meeting on Friday and stress tests on banks planned in the
coming weeks.	
 ""While stronger euro-zone data this week may be lending some
support, we believe that uncertainty heading into Friday's Euro
Area Summit is keeping the trade choppy,"" said Jessica Hoversen,
currency strategist at MF Global in Chicago.	
 ""If officials make no progress and Germans remain unwavering
in their demands, the likelihood of a capitulation (in the euro)
will be significantly higher,"" she added. 
 The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.3818 , having
dropped to as low as $1.3804 earlier.	
 Market players expect the focus to fall on debt woes in the
coming weeks, when European leaders and finance ministers will
hold a series of meetings to deal with debt problems, starting
with the euro zone summit on Friday.	
 Few investors, however, expect a breakthrough at these
meetings. 
 ""Our view is that the financial markets will be disappointed
by the announcement due to resistance by countries like Germany
where public sentiment is strongly against further bailouts,""
said Jonathan Clark, president of FX Concepts, a currency hedge
fund in New York, with assets under management of about $8.4
billion.	
 FX Concepts, which employs systematic investment strategies,
said the cycles suggest that the euro has formed a medium-term
peak, although it could see some final strength into Friday. The
models also suggest that the euro could peak again in June when
equities are likely to hit a top.	
 
 AUSSIE HIT BY DATA	
 The Australian dollar fell after data showed China swung to
a surprise trade deficit in February of $7.3 billion, its
largest in seven years. 
 The numbers stirred worries that China's growth could slow
and affect countries such as Australia, which has benefited from
China's expansion.	
 Earlier, the Australian dollar briefly tumbled after data
showed Australian employment fell 10,100 in February, well below
market expectations for a rise of 20,000. The data did show,
however, that full-time employment rose 47,600, helping limit
the impact on the Aussie. .	
 The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $1.0036 ,
dipping below support near $1.0055, which is right around the
61.8 percent retracement of its rally from late February to
early March, and also near an intraday low hit on March 8. 
 Traders said there was talk of bids for the Australian
dollar near parity and large stop-loss bids around $0.9950. 
 Sterling fell 0.3 percent to $1.6158 ahead of a
central bank policy decision later on Thursday.	
 The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold on
Thursday. Market players are bracing for the possibility of a
quarter percentage point rate hike in May. 
The New Zealand dollar dipped 0.2 percent to $0.7354
, having hit a five-month low of $0.7332 after the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest rates by an aggressive
50 basis points to 2.5 percent. The rate cut was expected to
ease the impact of an earthquake that hit the country last
month. 
 The dollar inched up 0.2 percent to 82.90 yen .

 * Weak China Feb trade fuels growth worries

(Updates prices)	
 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, March 10 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets and copper
prices fell on Thursday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade
data hit markets already nervous that higher oil prices will cut
global growth.	
 Investors were also worried about the euro zone's sovereign
debt problem after Portugal on Wednesday saw its cost for
issuing two-year debt soar to its highest level since it joined
the euro in 1999, rekindling fears Lisbon will need a bailout.	
 That put the euro in a tough position, having recently risen
on the back of expectations of a possible April interest rate
hike by the European Central Bank. The common currency fell to
$1.3870 , well off highs just above $1.40 on Monday.	
 The combination of negative factors knocked 1.5 percent off
Tokyo's Nikkei average . Stocks elsewhere in Asia
slid 1.3 percent.	
 U.S. stock index futures were also in the
red, suggesting a weak start for Wall Street.	
 Technology shares in Asia came under extra pressure after
sector heavyweight Texas Instruments issued a weak
outlook. Samsung Electronics fell 2.7 percent.	
 Latest data showed China swung to a surprise trade deficit
in February of $7.3 billion, its largest in seven years, as the
Lunar New Year holiday dealt a sharper blow to export activity
than had been expected. 
 ""It's come on a day when commodity prices are off, and
investors are worried about global growth and it's just
accentuated the market pullback,"" said Shane Oliver, head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors.	
 ""The Lunar New Year does heavily distort Chinese trade data
and I'll be inclined not to read too much into it. But the
market is obviously feeling nervous and has probably read a bit
more into it.""	
 Shanghai copper fell nearly 3 percent after the
weak Chinese trade data cast doubts on demand from the world's
biggest consumer of the metal. Copper on the London Metal
Exchange shed 0.4 percent to $9,235 a tonne.	
 ""The Middle East crisis which sent oil prices surging, as
well as doubts on whether China's copper demand would continue
to boom, have cast a shadow on the market,"" said Zhu Bin, an
analyst at Nanhua Futures based in China.	
 U.S. crude rose towards $105 a barrel, not far from a
peak near $107 earlier this week, after forces loyal to Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi bombed oil industry infrastructure,
inflicting what could be longer-term damage on the country's
exporting capacity.	
 Brent crude gained 0.3 percent to $116.26.	
 Rising oil prices have fuelled worries about inflation,
prompting the Bank of Korea to raise interest rates on Thursday
for a fourth time in less than a year in a bid to keep a lid on
prices. 
 New Zealand, on the other hand, cut rates as expected to try
to help its economy recover after last month's devastating
earthquake.	
 Revised data on Thursday showed Japan's economy, the world's
third largest, shrank at a slightly faster annualised pace in
the fourth quarter than initially reported.	
 But analysts expect improving exports to help the Japanese
economy return to growth this year, although they warned that
high oil prices pose a threat to the outlook. 
 The rout in stock markets helped lift demand for U.S.
Treasuries, sending the benchmark 10-year yield down
to 3.462 percent, near a one-week low around 3.449 percent set
on Wednesday.	
 This was despite news the world's largest bond fund had gone
ultra bearish on the United States, dumping all of its U.S.
government-related debt holdings.

(Updates with new poll, comments on bond market)
 By Yoo Choonsik and Kim Yeonhee	
 SEOUL, March 10 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank
raised interest rates as expected on Thursday and hinted that
further policy tightening would be gradual despite
stronger-than-expected inflation, helping push bond prices
sharply higher.	
 Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong-soo said inflation, now at
27-month highs, would soon peak and head lower later in the
year, adding that the current, measured pace of tightening would
help curb price expectations.	
 ""The consensus view is that oil prices will ease at some
point. In the second half, the pace of upward inflation will
likely be moderated and controlled compared with that of the
first half,"" Kim told reporters.	
 ""If we move (with 25 basis point rises) at a steady pace,
the public's inflation expectations are expected to be adjusted
accordingly...For now, I think this pace (of tightening) is
sufficient,"" Kim said, dismissing market talk that the central
bank might have been behind the curve in bringing rates to more
normal levels.	
 Kim's comments supported economists' views that the central
bank would probably raise rates again in the next quarter but
then adopt a more modest stance if inflation appeared to be
topping out as expected.	
 Economists agreed that inflation would peak in a few
months but differed on the trend thereafter, saying it would
stay at higher levels than the central bank chief expected. 
 The BoK raised the benchmark 7-day repurchase
agreement rate by 25 basis points to 3.0 percent in
its fourth hike since July last year. Fourteen of 16 analysts
polled by Reuters had predicted an increase.

 Seventeen of 18 economists and analysts polled by Reuters
after the rate decision expected the central bank to raise rates
by another 25 bps in the second quarter, with many tipping a
move in May.	
 Ten of the 18 expected one further rate rise later in the
year, with the base rate ending 2011 at 3.5 percent, though a
few others predicted two to three increases in that timeframe.	
 Rates were at 5.25 percent in mid-2008 before the global
financial crisis gripped Asia.	
 Bond prices jumped as institutional investors,
reassured of modest future tightening by the central bank,
rushed to rebuild their holdings, though some analysts
attributed the gains to purchases by cash-rich banks and saw the
rally as unsustainable. 
 Bond traders said policymakers may grow more cautious about
further tightening amid expectations that economic data will
start to show moderating domestic growth. 
 ""Many institutions had been reluctant to buy
(bonds) on caution about the central bank's future policy stance
but rushed to buy after the governor assured he would maintain
the baby-step approach,"" said Shin Dong-kwan, a bond dealer at
Daewoo Securities. 
 
 INFLATION STALKS ASIA	
 Emerging market economies across Asia are grappling with a
rapid pick-up in inflation, led by higher food and energy
prices, even as advanced economies remain in an early and
fragile stage of recovery from the 2007-2008 global financial
crisis.	
 Thailand and Vietnam raised rates earlier this week in an
attempt to curb mounting price pressures, while China raised
rates last month for the second time in just over six weeks.

 South Korea's annual consumer inflation exceeded the central
bank's internal projections in both January and February, Kim
said earlier this week. It quickened to a 27-month high of 4.5
percent in February, far above the Bank of Korea's target band
of 2-4 percent. 
 ""Inflation will be heading up through June. My forecast
is 4.4 percent for the full year,"" said Tim Condon, chief Asia
economist at ING Financial Markets in Singapore. 
 Governor Kim said he was maintaining the official
forecast for annual inflation to average 3.3 percent in the
second half, which would bring the full-year reading below 4
percent. 
 Gasoline prices have risen every single day for the
past five months in the resource-starved country,
threatening to cut into consumer spending, and the government
has imposed restrictions on electricity use.	
 But in one encouraging sign, monthly growth in producer
prices slowed from January, central bank data showed on
Thursday, indicating inflation may be approaching a peak.	
 There has also been some disagreement among central bank
board members about the effectiveness of using interest rate
rises to curb inflation that is being led by higher
international prices of raw materials. Some see higher borrowing
costs as a risk to economic growth.	
 Two of the six board members voted against raising interest
rates in January and Kim said not all members voted for
Thursday's decision.	
 President Lee Myung-bak earlier told an economic policy
meeting that the government's focus should now be on fighting
inflation, rather than growth.	
 Inflation has become the main political issue ahead of a
by-election next month that will be a crucial gauge of support
for Lee and his Grand National Party before parliamentary and
presidential votes next year.

 BEIJING, March 10 (Reuters) - China swung to a surprise
trade deficit in February of $7.3 billion, its largest in seven
years, as the Lunar New Year holiday dealt an unexpectedly sharp
blow to exports.	
 It was China's first trade deficit since March last year and
its biggest since February 2004. Economists, who had forecast a
small surplus of $4.95 billion, said the sudden drop was likely
to prove temporary.	
 ""We did expect exports to slow last month, but I think
nobody had expected such a weak outcome,"" said Nie Wen, an
analyst at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.	
 ""There is little chance that China will have a trade deficit
again, and the monthly trade surplus may pick up in the second
half of this year,"" he added.	
 Still, the extent of the slowdown in both exports and
imports caught markets by surprise. Asian stocks tumbled on
worries that monetary tightening in China and other emerging
markets was taking a real chunk out of economic growth.

 The deficit will at least be welcome news on two fronts for
the Chinese government, helping it dampen inflationary pressure
and deflect calls for faster yuan appreciation. 
 
 Cash inflows from the country's vast trade surplus over the
past few years have been a root cause of China's recent run-up
in prices. 
 Inflation reached a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in the year
to November. Data due on Friday is expected to show it pulled
back to 4.7 percent in February. 
 With tightening policies beginning to have an impact, China
is confident that it can achieve its 2011 goal of holding
inflation to an average of 4 percent this year, Ma Jiantang, the
government's statistics chief, said on Thursday. 
 His comments followed a report in an official newspaper that
bank lending in February was much less than expected, indicating
that Beijing has scored some success in reining in credit
issuance, a crucial part of its campaign to control inflation.	
 Until that number is confirmed, though, attention will be
squarely on China's precipitous drop in exports.	
 China exports grew 2.4 percent in February from a year
earlier, the customs agency said on Thursday, well short of
forecasts for a rise of 26.2 percent.	
 Imports increased 19.4 percent, missing market expectations
of a 32.3 percent increase. 
 The data hit markets when investors are already worried that
high oil prices will undermine global growth. Japan's Nikkei
stock average fell 1.5 percent and stocks elsewhere in
Asia slid 1.4 percent.	
 ""It's come on a day when commodity prices are off, and
investors are worried about global growth and it's just
accentuated the market pullback,"" said Shane Oliver, head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors.	
 ""The Lunar New Year does heavily distort Chinese trade data
and I'll be inclined not to read too much into it. But the
market is obviously feeling nervous and has probably read a bit
more into it.""	
 
 HOLIDAY EFFECT	
 The government has in the past pointed to a narrower trade
surplus as evidence that it is making headway in tilting China
away from excessive reliance on exports, a shift that is seen as
a crucial part of putting the global economy on firmer footing.	
 But many economists cautioned against reading too much into
one month's trade data, especially in the first quarter. 
 Chinese exports typically slump at the start of the year,
with the country's factories shut or running at half speed for
weeks because of China's New Year holiday, which this year fell
in the first week of February.	
 ""We believe the trade deficit is likely to be a temporary
phenomenon distorted by the Lunar New Year. During the several
weeks following the Lunar New Year, the holiday distortions
affect exports much more than imports because exporters have a
much greater tendency to take extended holidays,"" Yu Song and
Helen Qian, economists with Goldman Sachs, said in a note.	
 Yet the holiday effect had been expected to weigh on exports
when analysts made their initial forecasts, so some said that
the downside disappointment in the data was, in fact, a worry.	
 ""Both imports and exports are lower than expected, and
seasonal factors alone can't explain the sharp monthly drop,""
said Xu Biao, economist with China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen.	
 ""It is definitely not a good sign. The size of imports is
already read as a measure of domestic demand. But now imports
have dropped significantly, and it points to a serious weakening
in domestic economic activity,"" he said.	
 
 CONTROLLING FOR HOLIDAY	
 Because of distortions caused by the Chinese New Year, some
analysts prefer to look at data for January and February
together.	
 On that combined basis, exports rose 21.3 percent from a
year earlier and imports increased 36.0 percent, both of which
were faster than December's pace.	
 The average trade balance for the first two months of 2011
was a $0.4 billion deficit, far below the monthly average of a
$15 billion surplus last year.	
 ""We look at January and February together. On that basis,
growth is still quite healthy. We were expecting exports and
imports to slow this year due to weak external demand, so this
is line with that,"" said Tao Wang, chief China economist for
UBS.	
 With import growth set to outpace export growth, China was
hoping to narrow its trade surplus for the third straight year,
Commerce Minister Chen Deming said earlier this week. China's
trade surplus was $183 billion last year, down from $196 billion
in 2009 and a record $295 billion in 2008. 
 Chen also said that the yuan was on ""a gradual upward
trend"", but that there was no reason for it to move any faster.
Although the yuan has been running near record highs against the
dollar, it has only appreciated about 4 percent since being
depegged last June.

 TOKYO, March 10 - The euro edged lower against the U.S.
dollar on Thursday, with further pullbacks seen likely, as
worries about how Europe will address its fiscal problems offset
expectations of an upcoming rate hike by the European Central
Bank. 
 Technical strategists said the euro's consolidation from
Monday's four-month peak at $1.4036 is still in progress and a
deeper retreat cannot be ruled out.	
 However, strong support is expected from the near-term
rising trend line, around $1.3810, which should contain the
euro's fall.	
 On the upside, a break of $1.4036 could propel the rally to
that early November high at $1.4283. 
 Investors, meanwhile, are looking ahead to a European policy
makers' meeting on Friday and stress tests on banks planned in
the coming weeks.	
 ""While stronger euro zone data this week may be lending some
support, we believe that uncertainty heading into Friday's Euro
Area Summit is keeping the trade choppy,"" said Jessica Hoversen,
currency strategist at MF Global in Chicago.	
 Investors seemed to be ignoring concerns over the euro
zone's periphery, she said, in favour of a higher rate outlook.
But she added: ""If officials make no progress and Germans remain
unwavering in their demands, the likelihood of a capitulation
(in the euro) will be significantly higher.""	
 Hoversen said a break below February's high above $1.3860
should result in further euro losses.	
 In midday Tokyo trading, the euro was down slightly at
$1.3895 .	
 Market players expect the focus to fall on debt woes in the
coming weeks, when European leaders and finance ministers will
hold a series of meetings to deal with debt problems, starting
with the euro zone summit on Friday.	
 Few investors, however, expect a breakthrough at these
meetings. 
 ""Our view is that the financial markets will be disappointed
by the announcement due to resistance by countries like Germany
where public sentiment is strongly against further bailouts,""
said Jonathan Clark, president of FX Concepts, a currency hedge
fund in New York, with assets under management of about $8.4
billion.	
 FX Concepts, which employs systematic investment strategies,
said the cycles suggest that the euro has formed a medium-term
peak, although it could see some final strength into Friday. The
models also suggest that the euro could peak again in June when
equities are likely to hit a top.	
 In other currencies, the Australian dollar briefly tumbled
after data showed Australian employment fell 10,100 in February,
well below market expectations for a rise of 20,000. The
unemployment rate was in line with expectations at 5.0 percent.
.	
 In midday Tokyo trading, the Aussie was down 0.4 percent at
US$1.0068 , with support at US$1.0057, the 61.8 percent
retracement of its rally from late February to early March.
Talk of Aussie option expiries between US$1.0060 to US$1.0130
may help to limit volatility in the near term.	
 Data showing China posted a trade deficit in February also
weighed on the Aussie. The numbers suggested
that China's growth could slow and affect countries such as
Australia, which has benefited from China's expansion.	
 Sterling traded at $1.6208 , little changed on the
day and off last week's high of $1.6344.	
 The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold at its
monetary policy committee meeting on Thursday but some
policymakers are growing increasingly nervous about the threat
of inflation, and money markets are fully pricing in around a 75
percent chance of a quarter percentage point rate hike in
May. 
The New Zealand dollar recovered from losses, trading flat at
US$0.7371 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest
rates by an aggressive 50 basis points to 2.5 percent. The rate
cut was expected to ease the impact of an earthquake that hit
the country last month. 
The kiwi drew some support from comments by the central
bank's chief that easing would have to be reversed once
rebuilding from the Christchurch earthquake got under way in
earnest. 
 But its technical outlook looks fragile after it hit a
five-month low around US$0.7335 , breaching its December
low in the wake of the rate cut. A possible target was seen
around US$0.7270, a 50 percent retracement of its rally from May
to November last year. The kiwi last traded at $0.7355.	
 The dollar stood at 82.72 yen , unchanged from late on
Wednesday but off a four-week low of 81.57 yen hit earlier this
month. Japanese exporters, however, are said to be waiting to
sell at and above 83 yen, which is likely to be enough to keep
the pair in its rough 81-84 yen range of the past few months.

 BEIJING, March 10 (Reuters) - China posted its largest trade
deficit in seven years in February as the Lunar New Year holiday
dealt a sharper blow to export activity than expected, while
import growth also disappointed on the downside.

 * Dollar edges lower vs euro
 * U.S. benchmark yields fall

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss	
 TOKYO, March 10 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged lower on
Thursday, weighed down by worries that a surge in oil prices
could exacerbate inflation pressures in the region and cripple
economic growth.	
U.S. oil futures rose 0.3 percent, following a 2.5
percent jump in Brent oil late on Wednesday to $115.94 a
barrel. Oil advanced as fighting in Libya worsened and OPEC saw
no need for an emergency meeting to consider raising output.
Fears that Libya's uprising could spread further in the Middle
East also dented market sentiment.	
 ""Tensions in the (Middle East) will ... remain on our radar.
We have reiterated the importance of Friday's Day of Rage in
Saudi Arabia,"" said Jessica Hoversen, currency strategist at MF
Global in Chicago.	
 The dollar has moved with swings in oil prices. Higher oil
prices tend to be negative for the greenback as the U.S. is a
major oil importer.	
 The surge in oil could hurt major economies like Japan, the
world's third largest. On Thursday, the Cabinet Office said
Japanese gross domestic product shrank a revised 0.3 percent in
the final quarter of 2010. [ID:nTKU000078}.	
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan's economy to grow
0.5 percent in the current quarter on improved exports and
factory output. The economy is seen likely to continue growing
this year, but high oil prices pose a risk to the outlook.

 Japan's Nikkei average fell as well, mainly pressured by the
weakness in U.S. stocks, with soaring oil a negative factor as
well. The benchmark Nikkei shed 0.4 percent, or 42.39
points to 10,547.11. The broader Topix index fell 0.3
percent to 941.16. 
 Seoul shares were also lower on Thursday, with technology
plays facing pressure after U.S. tech stocks fell on a weak
outlook from Texas Instruments. Investors were also wary of an
expected rate hike by the Bank of Korea later on Thursday. 
Shares in Samsung Electronics and Hynix
Semiconductor both fell 1.5 percent. 
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was
down 0.15 percent at 1,998.40 points. 
 U.S. Treasuries rallied on renewed fears of a debt crisis in
Europe after Portugal saw its cost for issuing two-year debt
soar to its highest level since it joined the euro in 1999. That
magnified fears that Portugal may need a bailout.	
 U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were
unchanged, following gains the previous session. The yield was
at 3.477 percent, down from 3.475 percent on Wednesday.	
 European debt fears also weighed on the euro, which was flat
against the dollar on Thursday, after hitting a four-month peak
on Monday. A European Union summit on Friday to discuss ways on
how to overhaul the euro zone economies also contributed to the
euro's pullback. In early Tokyo trading, the euro was little
changed at $1.3915 .

 * Kiwi under pressure after aggressive rate cut by RBNZ

 TOKYO, March 10 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Thursday off a one-week low, although its
yield advantage, the main driver of its rally so far this year, is increasingly undermined by
worries about how Europe will mend fiscal problems of several euro zone countries as the market
looks to a European policy makers' meeting and stress tests on banks planned in the coming
weeks.	
 While euro zone interest rates continue to rise as investors price in a rate hike in April
and more hikes later this year, doubts are creeping in about whether the euro zone economy will
be able to withstand such monetary tightening given a patchy recovery in the economy.	
 ""The market has already priced in a rise in euro zone rates to near 2 percent by the end of
the year. But there are worries about whether rrbrthe economy can cope with such high rates,""
said Makoto Noji, a senior strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.	
 ""It's also hard to think investors will try to price in even more aggressive rate hikes from
now, which suggests the euro may be capped in the near term,"" he said.	
 In an auction on Wednesday, Portugal saw its cost for issuing two-year debt soar to the
highest level since it adopted the euro in 1999, highlighting fears that a rate hike could push
some euro zone periphery countries into a corner.
??The euro traded at $1.3905 , little changed from late U.S. levels, after having fallen
to as low as $1.3855 on Wednesday, its lowest in nearly a week. 
 Some market players expect the market's focus to fall on debt woes in coming weeks, when
European leaders and finance ministers will hold a series of meetings to deal with debt
problems, starting with a euro zone summit on Friday.	
 A similar dichotomy of rate hike outlook and concerns over a weak recovery is also in play
for the British pound to a certain extent, helping to stall its rally after it hit a one-year
high last week.	
 Sterling traded at $1.6200 , off last week's high of $1.6344.	
 The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold at its monetary policy committee
meeting on Thursday but some policymakers are growing increasingly nervous about the threat of
inflation and money markets are fully pricing in around a 75 percent chance of a quarter
percentage point rate hike in May, with the likelihood of two more before the end of the year.

 In contrast, The New Zealand dollar stayed under pressure after the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand cut interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points to 2.5 percent to mitigate the
impact of an earthquake that hit the country last month.	
 The kiwi drew some support from comments by the central bank's chief that easing would have
to be reversed once rebuilding from the Christchurch earthquake got under way in earnest.	
 But its technical outlook looks fragile after it hit a five-month low around $0.7335
, falling below its December low following the rate cut, with a possible target seen at
around $0.7270, a 50 percent retracement of its rally from May to November last year. The kiwi
last traded at $0.7355. 
 ""Investors' risk appetite is no so strong at the moment because of oil prices. In such an
environment, currencies of countries that run a current account deficit and rely on foreign
capital, such as the kiwi, are coming under pressure,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at
Nikko Cordial Securities.	
 The dollar stood at 82.78 yen , retaining its rebound from a four-week low of 81.57
yen hit earlier this month, although Japanese exporters are said to be waiting to sell at and
above 83 yen, which is likely to be enough to keep the pair in its rough 81-84 yen range of the

(Adds analyst comments on capital spending)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, March 10 (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank at a
slightly faster annualised pace in the last quarter than
initially reported as capital spending was revised lower,
reflecting dull domestic demand, but exports likely fuelled a
return to growth this year.
 The downward revision is unlikely to alter the government's
view that the economy will soon emerge from a lull, but the
threat of high oil prices and signs of a policy stalemate with
opposition parties could pose risks to the economic outlook.
 Wholesale prices rose in February at the fastest annual rate
since November 2008 due to high commodity prices, which could
eventually put pressure on corporate profits and pose another
risk to economic growth.
 ""Exports will lead growth this year, but consumption may not
do well as wage growth is very slow,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, senior
economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute.
 ""I'm very worried about high oil prices, because that could
hurt export demand and domestic consumption. If anything could
derail Japan's recovery, it would likely be due to oil prices.""
 Gross domestic product fell a revised 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter from the prior quarter, matching the median market
forecast and unchanged from the preliminary reading.
 On an annualised basis, the economy contracted 1.3 percent,
also matching economists' forecast. The fall was slightly bigger
than the preliminary reading of a 1.1 percent decline.
 OIL PRICE CONCERNS
 ""The economy was stalling in October-December but we hope and
think it is picking up from this year on the back of exports and
domestic car sales,"" said Takashi Wada, a parliamentary secretary
at the Cabinet Office.
 ""We're most concerned about oil price trends stemming from
uncertainty in the Middle East,"" he told reporters, adding that
he was also worried about the fate of the 2011/12 budget and
related bills in a split parliament.
 Capital expenditure rose a revised 0.5 percent, less than the
government's preliminary reading of a 0.9 percent rise and the
0.8 percent gain expected by economists.
 ""The slowdown in capital spending was caused primarily by
weak domestic demand, but fast-growing emerging economies will
boost Japan's exports and manufacturing spending this year,"" said
Yasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
 Given solid exports and steady cash flow at manufacturers,
capital spending is likely to rise 4 to 5 percent in the year
from April 1 and help the economy to grow 1.6 percent, even
though sluggish personal consumption will remain a drag, he said.
 The revised GDP data showed private consumption slid 0.8
percent in the fourth quarter, against an initial reading of a
0.7 percent decline, contributing to the downward revision of the
overall figure.
 Japanese wholesale prices rose 1.7 percent in the year to
February, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Thursday,
accelerating their pace of gains for a fourth straight month on
higher commodity prices.
 The rise in the corporate goods price index (CGPI), which
measures the prices that companies charge each other for their
goods and services, was slightly less than a median forecast for
a 1.8 percent annual increase and the biggest rise since a 2.4
percent annual gain in November 2008.
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan's economy to grow 0.5
percent in the current quarter as exports and factory output have
been improving. The economy is likely to continue growing this
year but high oil prices pose a risk.
 The BOJ last year cut interest rates virtually to zero, set
up a fund to buy assets ranging from government bonds to real
estate investment trusts, and created a scheme to encourage
lending to nascent industries with high potential for growth.
 The measures have done little, however, to spur bank lending
as companies have ample cash flow.
 The central bank, which next meets on March 14-15, has

(Add comments, details, quotes)	
 BEIJING, March 10 (Reuters) - China is confident that it can
hold inflation to an average of 4 percent this year, the
government's statistics chief said on Thursday, but a central
bank adviser warned that soaring commodity costs were adding to
upside risks. 
 Their comments followed a report in an official newspaper
that new yuan loans were slightly more than 500 billion yuan
($76.24 billion) in February, considerably less than expected,
indicating that the government has scored some success in
reining in credit issuance, a crucial part of its campaign to
control inflation.	
 Ma Jiantang, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, told
reporters at China's annual session of parliament that he was
confident the country would hit its goal of 4 percent average
inflation, despite upward pressure on prices.	
 However, Li Daokui, a central bank adviser, was
quoted as saying that consumer price inflation could climb to an
average 5 percent this year because of surging commodity prices.	
 But that forecast, which is above the consensus of most
independent economists, was not backed up by any quotes in the
report by the English-language China Daily. 
 In fact, in one comment quoted at length, Li appeared to
give a much more benign outlook.	
 ""We still have ample production capacity. If agricultural
production is reasonably healthy, and international commodity
prices don't rise too high, it's likely we can keep inflation
below 5 percent,"" Li said.	
 ""Core inflation, excluding food and fuel, will be kept well
below 3 percent,"" he added. 
 
 CONCERNS FROM AFAR	
 The biggest uncertainty in China's inflation battle came
from afar, said Li, who is also a professor at Tsinghua
University and a member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Committee, an advisory body to the parliament.	
 ""As the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East leads to
higher and higher crude oil prices, certainly it's a major
concern for China's economy, because the country has recently
imported as much as 55 percent of its oil consumption,"" he said.	
 ""An oil price of $120 or $130 a barrel might be the worst
scenario for 2011,"" Li added.	
 China's CPI rose 4.9 percent in the year to January.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast that it might have slowed
to 4.7 percent in February, as tightening measures have started
to bite. 
 China raised interest rates three times and banks'
required reserves five times over the past half year, trying to
arrest the rise in inflation, which hit a 28-month peak in
November.	
 In a statement on the central bank's website, monetary
policy department head Zhang Xiaohui said that making the yuan's
exchange rate more flexible would help China to curb both
inflation and asset bubbles. 
 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said in his government work
report to parliament that Beijing was targeting a 4 percent
increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for 2011.

 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, March 9 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso blew past a
key technical level on Wednesday to notch a nearly 2-1/2 year
high, suggesting the currency may be able to make a further
push higher after struggling in a range since January.
 Traders said flows from long-term investors, including a
big bet by a hedge fund, caught the market by surprise when
many expected the currency's gains during the session to be
less sharp. A resulting scramble to buy pesos and cover losses
exacerbated the break.
 Demand for Mexico's exports is expected to be lifted by the
recovery in the U.S. economy, and the peso may be on track to
hit levels close to 11.80 per dollar that some analysts have
been signaling.
 ""Long-term investors are entering Mexico,"" said Francisco
Diez, director of emerging markets trading at RBC Capital
Markets in New York. ""It looks like a lot of dollars went into
Mexico today.""
 The Mexican peso  firmed 0.63 percent to 11.93 per
dollar, its strongest since Oct. 2008. The currency punched
through its previous high at 11.9439 set in January that many
thought would hold during the session.
 Mexico's currency has lagged the gains in other emerging
market economies. But some investors think it could try and
catch up this year as the U.S. economy gains steam.
 Local banks exercised $367 million in dollar put options
with the central bank on Wednesday, leaving $200 million of the
$600 million the central bank is selling every month to build
up its currency reserves.
 The options give banks the right to sell dollars to the
central bank at a better peso rate than the spot market.
 ""The fact that $200 million were not exercised suggests the
holders of those options think the peso could get even
stronger,"" said Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura
Securities.
 REAL SLUMPS
 Brazil's real recoiled on fresh fears authorities could
take new measures to stem the currency's gains, while Chile's
peso slumped on falling copper prices.
 As Brazil's local markets reopened after the Carnival
holiday, the real  bid at 1.655 per dollar, 0.73 percent
weaker from its close last Friday at a 2-1/2-year high.
 The real had then closed beyond what many see as the
Finance Ministry's unofficial limit around 1.65 per dollar.
 A ministry source told Reuters the government may announce
a new round of measures this week aimed at curtailing the
strong real.[ID:nN04241800]
 Some analysts think Brazilian authorities could take more
aggressive action than in the past. Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, an
analyst at RBS Securities, said one option could be to raise a
tax on foreign investments in equities.
 ""The risk is that they do something that is not very
market-friendly,"" she said.
 Last October the government tripled to 6 percent a tax on
foreigners buying local bonds and trading in currency
derivatives. The tax on equity investments held at 2 percent.
 Brazil has steadily escalated its intervention in currency
markets since 2009 as a tide of global investment was drawn to
its double-digit interest rates. The flows pumped up the real
by more than 40 percent since the beginning of 2009.
 The stronger real is hurting local manufacturers who have
to compete with cheapening imports. So far, Brazil's efforts to
weaken the currency have slowed, but not deterred its advance.
 Chile's currency  lost 0.57 percent to 477.7 per
dollar as copper prices fell. Higher crude oil prices worried
investors that inflationary pressures could hit economic growth
and demand for the industrial metal.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Brent oil prices jumped on
Wednesday, weighing on global stocks, as escalating violence in
Libya increased fears that higher energy costs could choke the
global economic recovery.
 U.S. Treasuries prices rose on a safety bid following the
sale of Portuguese debt at unsustainably high yields. Appetite
for safe-haven assets also drove strong demand in an auction of
10-year Treasuries.
 Mining stocks led European equities lower as prices of key
base metals fell on concerns about economic growth as oil
prices rose. Wall Street was also pressured by a disappointing
profit outlook from chip maker Texas Instruments, but a jump in
IBM shares supported the Dow.
 Nikkei futures traded in Chicago  were little changed
at 10,565.00, showing investors' lack of conviction in a market
direction.
 Brent oil  jumped 2.55 percent to $115.94 a barrel
as fighting in Libya intensified and OPEC saw no need for an
emergency meeting to consider raising output. Worries that the
unrest could spread further in the Middle East also left
investors jittery.
 ""It's a fear trade,"" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC
Markets. ""It's about the fear of these troubles escalating --
there is some concern about how the Saudi Day of Rage will go
on Friday.""
 Activists in Saudi Arabia have set up Facebook pages
calling for protests on March 11 and 20.
 Expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries would respond to the decline in Libya's
output by rising production had driven oil prices lower on
Tuesday, one day after they hit a 2-1/2-year high.
[ID:nLDE7280UW]
 In New York, however, U.S. crude oil futures  closed
lower, after seesawing between gains and losses, as investors
eyed a greater-than-expected rise in U.S. stockpiles last week.
Oil in New York fell 0.61 percent to settle at $104.38 a
barrel.
 World stocks edged lower, with the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> down 0.1 percent at 343.21 points.
 On Wall Street, the Dow was cushioned by IBM , which
jumped 2.2 percent to $165.86. The tech giant's shares hit an
all-time high one day after it stuck to its promise to nearly
double profits by 2015.
 A weaker-than-expected earnings target by Texas Instruments
 weighed on the Nasdaq, however. Shares of the chip
maker fell 3.1 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 1.29 points,
or 0.01 percent, to 12,213.09, while the Standard & Poor's 500

percent, to 2,751.72.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top

 PORTUGAL IN NEED
 Prices of U.S. government bonds rose as investors moved to
safe-haven assets after an auction of Portuguese debt revived
worries about the financial troubles of peripheral euro zone
countries.
 U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  gained
21/32 in price, with the yield at 3.4675 percent. Prices rose
further after the high yield in an auction of $21 billion of
reopened 10-year notes came in below market expectations.
 Portugal was able to sell 1 billion euros in two-year bonds
at an auction but its borrowing cost was the highest since it
joined the euro. Lisbon said such yields were unsustainable in
the long run without Europe-wide action.
 ""The auction was always going to go OK ... but I don't
think clients are particularly interested in buying the bond,""
said a trader in London. ""The problems remain -- we've got the
March 25 summit coming up, we've got continued selling in
Greece.""
 Euro zone leaders are expected to agree on Friday on the
next steps in their year-long effort to quell the region's debt
crisis, but the summit is unlikely to produce a breakthrough.
[ID:nLDE7270VF]
 The euro fell from an earlier high to trade flat against
the dollar as expectations of a euro-zone interest rate hike
next month faded and investors focused on the region's debt
problems.
 Investors worry that monetary policy tightening by the
European Central Bank would further raise borrowing costs for
peripheral euro zone economies.
 The euro  was unchanged at $1.3903, falling from an
earlier four-month high of $1.4036 hit on electronic trading
platform EBS.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - The euro failed to retest a
recent four-year peak against the dollar on Wednesday, and
analysts said persistent worries about the fiscal health of
several euro zone countries may limit further gains.
 The euro hit a four-month high above $1.40 this week as
markets began pricing in an April euro zone interest rate hike.
But it retreated a day ago amid concern about the ability of
indebted countries to withstand higher borrowing costs.
 The currency last traded at $1.3904, unchanged from late
Tuesday. It bounced off technical support in the $1.3860 area
but was still off the day's high of $1.3942.
 In an auction Wednesday, Portugal saw its cost for issuing
two-year debt soar to its highest level since it joined the
euro in 1999, underscoring fears that it will need a bailout.
 If the European Central Bank lifts interest rates, it could
impair the ability of countries such as Portugal, Greece and
Ireland to boost growth. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
signaled last week that the bank could hike rates in April.
 ""I don't trust the euro,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior
currency strategist at Westpac. ""The ECB is playing a dangerous
game here and could end up forcing Portugal and Spain into the
arms of (the euro zone rescue fund). I don't think it's a
coincidence that spreads are blowing out again.""
 The ECB's Axel Weber acknowledged Wednesday that peripheral
countries will undergo a painful adjustment process but said
the future of the euro was not at risk.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent at 82.70 yen. Fund managers
have been dollar buyers in recent weeks, according to UBS,
although the bank said choppy U.S. yields have limited gains
against the yen lately.
 Sterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.6203 while the New Zealand
dollar slipped 0.3 percent to $0.7366 after the central bank
cut interest rates by 50 basis points.
 The 17 euro zone heads of state are expected to agree at
Friday's summit on the next steps to quell the region's debt
crisis, though markets expect a major announcement to wait
until a March 24-25 meeting of all 27 European Union leaders.
 ""Inability of policymakers in the euro zone to agree on
measures to address the crisis is keeping the single currency
broadly pressured,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
Still, the euro is seen supported by favorable interest rate
differentials, with many expecting the ECB to retain a hawkish
bias despite the debt problems in peripheral member nations.
That is in sharp contrast to U.S. monetary policy which looks
set to remain loose for some time.
 The Fed holds its monthly policy meeting next week, and
while the U.S. jobless rate has declined in recent months, most
analysts think it's probably too early to expect the Fed to
signal a shift toward tighter monetary policy.

 By Mantik Kusjanto	
 WELLINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank
slashed interest rates on Thursday in an emergency move prompted
by concerns that the Christchurch earthquake might tip the
faltering economy back into recession. 
 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's 50 basis point cut
brought the cash rate down to 2.5 percent, matching its record
low. The RBNZ said the cut was needed to deal with the Feb. 22
quake that devastated the country's second-largest city.	
 Market watchers now expect the central bank to hold rates
steady at the new level until next year, when reconstruction
efforts will gather pace and spur stronger economic activity.	
 ""It has to be done. It's an extremely responsible decision,""
said ANZ senior currency trader Alex Sinton.	
 Analysts had expected a rate cut of at least 25 basis points
(bps) due to the earthquake. 
 Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said economic data would
guide further changes and that current accomodative policy would
need to be removed once the rebuilding phase kicked in.	
 ""This will take some time,"" Bollard added.	
 Initial estimates of the cost of the damage are as high as
NZ$15 billion ($11 billion), equivalent to about 8 percent of
the New Zealand's gross domestic product.

 ""This will result in a prolonged period of rates at these
levels but the next move will be up and, eventually,
aggressively so,"" said Stephen Toplis, head of research at
commercial lender Bank of New Zealand.	
 The 6.3 magnitude earthquake killed at least 166 people,
wrecked Christchurch's central business district and damaged
thousands of houses in the suburbs. 
 The earthquake came at a time when the New Zealand economy
was already weak, with a tepid recovery and soft house prices
weighing on household spending and discouraging businesses from
making new investments.	
 On Thursday, the central bank also scaled back its economic
projection for the year ending March 31, forecasting 0.9 percent
growth, almost half that of its previous forecast of 1.7
percent.	
 Despite the earthquake, the central bank forecast the 90-day
bank bill futures , a barometer for the official
cash rate, to be around 3 percent by March next year.	
 The New Zealand dollar initially fell nearly half a
cent to a five-month low of $0.7338, from $0.7385/90 then
recovered to settle around $0.7350. Against the Australian
dollar, the kiwi is hovering at around 19-year lows.	
 In stark contrast to its neighbour, Australia is riding a
commodities boom, with a strong currency and some of the highest
interest rates in the developed world.	
 
 MONETARY EMERGENCY	
 New Zealand interest rate futures <0#NBB:> rallied up to 12
ticks as investors further softened their forward rate
expectations.	
 After the rate move, lender Bank of New Zealand cut its
floating mortgage rate by 50 bps to around 5.99 percent from
6.49 percent.	
 Financial markets had priced in at least a 25 bps cut
to the cash rate, while a Reuters poll of 20 analysts showed
nine had expected a cut of 50 bps, five a 25 bps cut and six no
change. 
 The RBNZ, responding to the global financial crisis, cut the
cash rate to a record low of 2.5 percent in April 2009. It
raised the rate 25 bps points in June 2010 and again in July,
and then kept it at 3.0 percent until Thursday.	
 The central bank also made an emergency cut of 50 bps in
September 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the United States.	
 Economists have been divided over the need for the RBNZ to
cut rates because some saw fiscal policy as the better tool to
respond to the earthquake, but others argued it must act quickly
to bolster sentiment and reinvigorate the economy.	
 The bank, expecting a very large reconstruction programme by
2012, is now seen as on hold for the foreseeable future.	
 ""We are looking for the RBNZ to remove the insurance cuts
once reconstruction gets going, this could be as early as next
year,"" said ANZ-National head of market economics Khoon Goh.	
 The central bank said economic growth was expected
to be weak through the first half of the year, but activity
would gradually build by 2012 due to a large reconstruction
programme.	
 ""Given monetary policy's focus on the medium-term trend in
inflation, it would therefore be inappropriate, all else equal,
for monetary policy to be stimulatory during reconstruction,""
the central bank said. 
 Annual inflation jumped to 4.0 percent in the
December quarter, driven largely by a sales tax increase in
October that added around 2 percentage points to the rise,
suggesting that underlying inflation pressures appear contained.

 The RBNZ, which is required to keep annual inflation within
a 1-3 percent target band on average over the medium term, has
said it will look through this policy-driven spike.	
 However, globally inflation is building, with food prices
rising and oil prices hitting 2-1/2 year highs.	
 New Zealand has benefited from the global commodity boom
because of its large agricultural surpluses, but the bonanza has
so far failed to filter through the economy as farmers are
cautious about new spending and have used extra cash to trim
debt.	
 Market pricing implies that the cash rate will rise 45 bps
over the next 12 months .	
 A Reuters poll after the rate decision showed a majority
view that the rate will be held at 2.5 perecnt for the rest of
the year, rising to 3 percent by the end of the first quarter
2012. 
 The next RBNZ cash rate review will be on April 28.

 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Even as a truly unpredictable
political event unfolds across the Arab world this year, global
investors appear more comfortable than they have been for years
in coping with the financial fallout.
 That's not to say the viral unrest that has spread across
the Middle East and North Africa since January is positive for
world asset prices -- a sustained oil price spike clearly has
the opposite effect on stocks and bonds alike.
 But, unlike the existential threat to the entire financial
system presented by the credit implosion of 2007 and 2008,
investors can more easily price and discount the main economic
fallout from the current unrest -- namely higher energy costs.
 Take correlations between the main asset classes as a key
indicator of market stress -- where lockstep movements between
prices, so often indicative of violent herding, are denoted by a
maximum coefficient of 1 and where zero shows no link at all.
One of the most striking features of the credit bubble --
both in its final throes and especially after it burst -- was a
surge in correlations between major assets. Indiscriminate
demand for risk and yield gave way to the polar opposite and
this behaviour persisted as the risk-on/risk-off metronome
ticked back and forth over subsequent years.
 The inability to quantify the systemic risks to the
financial world saw investors stampede into cash; cash-like
securities like top-rated, liquid U.S. Treasuries; and gold.
 Everything else -- equities, corporate debt, most
commodities, emerging markets, real estate, private equity,
hedge funds -- suffered in tandem and correlations between these
assets soared to near lock-step 1.0.
 With U.S. cash and government securities one of the few
beneficiaries, the dollar saw extreme negative correlations with
most assets as it moved in the opposite direction.
 
 NEAR-ZERO CORRELATIONS
 So, it's curious then that in the midst of one of the most
surprising and dramatic global political upheavals for years,
financial markets appear to be unwinding those high-stress
correlations and resuming more ""normal"" and diverse behaviour.
 The most dramatic illustration has been the steep drop over
the past three months in a rolling 25-day correlation between
percentage moves in oil and world stocks from as high as 0.75 to
a barely significant -0.18 this week.
 A simple explanation may be that oil's recent spike is no
longer just part of a parallel commodities/equity reflation and
growth trade but has now reached levels which crimp global
demand and hence the equity of firms dependent on that.
 But the drop in correlations is not confined to crude. The
equivalent correlation between world stocks and the U.S. dollar,
for example, has also dropped since December from a hugely
negative -0.75 to less than -0.18.
 Emerging market equity correlations with oil and the dollar
tell a similar story and even the link between emerging stocks
and Wall Street is now below 0.5. Emerging market debt
correlations with Wall Street stocks are close to zero.
 If the ebbing of correlations is sustained, one conclusion
is that a more ""normal"" investment environment may be returning
-- one in which idiosyncratic differences between markets and
assets return to importance and investors can diversify and
spread their savings more broadly and with confidence again.
 The very damage inflicted by high crisis correlations on
diversified funds -- such as classic models used by Harvard and
Yale endowment funds -- has also accelerated the fund industry's
move to more nimble and sophisticated strategies and away from
index and benchmark targeting.
 Central to the shift is the growth of so-called Absolute
Return funds, which effectively act like hedge funds with more
limited risk taking but with similar ability to go long or short
on securities and derivatives.
 The extent of this shift, and the expected returns driving
it, were captured in a survey last year commissioned by asset
manager Pioneer Investments of almost 500 European institutional
investors with assets of some 2.65 trillion euros.
 More than 60 percent of investor groupings within the survey
-- banks, insurance companies and pension funds -- said they
were now opting for absolute returns strategies.
 With an ambitious mean annual return target of some 4.4
percent -- significantly higher than money market cash rates or
top-rated bond yields -- and after one of the worst decades in
60 years for a mixed investment fund, the need to break from the
herd has never been clearer.
 And the shift is global. Thomson Reuters' Lipper estimated
absolute-return mutual funds were in excess of $140 billion in
the final quarter of last year and U.S. asset managers Putnam
reckon that could grow to as much as $1.5 trillion -- or 15
percent of the industry.

But it retreated a day ago amid concern about the ability of
indebted countries to withstand higher borrowing costs.
 The currency last traded at $1.3898 , unchanged
from late Tuesday. It bounced off technical support in the
$1.3860 area but was still off the day's high of $1.3942.
 In an auction Wednesday, Portugal saw its cost for issuing
two-year debt soar to its highest level since it joined the
euro in 1999, underscoring fears that it will need a bailout.

 If the European Central Bank lifts interest rates, it could
impair the ability of countries such as Portugal, Greece and
Ireland to boost growth. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
signaled last week the bank could hike rates in April. 
 ""I don't trust the euro,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior
currency strategist at Westpac. ""The ECB is playing a dangerous
game here and could end up forcing Portugal and Spain into the
arms of (the euro zone rescue fund). I don't think it's a
coincidence that spreads are blowing out again.""
 The dollar was unchanged at 82.64 yen . Fund
managers have been dollar buyers in recent weeks, according to
UBS, although the bank said choppy U.S. yields have limited
gains against the yen in recent days.
 The euro was flat at 114.93 yen  while sterling
was up 0.3 percent at $1.6205 .
 The 17 euro zone heads of state are expected to agree at
Friday's summit on the next steps to quell the region's debt
crisis, though markets expect a major announcement to wait
until a March 24-25 meeting of all 27 European Union leaders.
[ID:nLDE7270VF]
 ""Inability of policymakers in the euro zone to agree on
measures to address the crisis is keeping the single currency
broadly pressured,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
Still, the euro is seen supported by favorable interest rate
differentials, with many expecting the ECB to retain a hawkish
bias despite the debt problems in peripheral member nations.
That is in sharp contrast to U.S. monetary policy which looks
set to remain loose for some time.
 The Fed holds its monthly policy meeting next week, and
while the U.S. jobless rate has declined in recent months, most
analysts think it's probably too early to expect the Fed to
signal a shift toward tighter monetary policy.

 NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - Brent oil prices jumped on
Wednesday, weighing on global stocks, as escalating violence in
Libya increased fears higher energy costs could choke the
global economic recovery.
 U.S. Treasuries prices were boosted by a safety bid
following the sale of Portuguese debt at unsustainably high
yields. Demand for safe-haven assets also translated into
strong demand in an auction of 10-year Treasuries.
 Mining stocks led European equity markets lower as prices
of key base metals fell on worries demand for raw materials
could be hit if economic growth slowed.

positive territory with a jump in IBM shares. The tech giant's
stock reached an all-time high one day after it promised to

 Expectations the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries would respond to the decline in Libya's output by
rising production had driven oil prices lower on Tuesday, one
day after they hit a 2-1/2-year high.
 In New York, however, U.S. crude oil futures

 * Essar mulls power station near steel plant
 * ZISCO targets 1 million tonnes of steel a year 
 
 (Adds details, comment, background from paragraph 5)
 By MacDonald Dzirutwe
 HARARE, March 9 (Reuters) - A unit of India's Essar Group
will invest an initial $750 million to restart production at
Zimbabwe steel firm ZISCO, in one of the biggest foreign
investments in the country, Zimbabwe's industry minister said.
 Essar Africa Holdings last November agreed to buy 54 percent
in Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), with the government
keeping 36 percent and 10 percent owned by minority investors.
 ""Essar will complete all work in regards to resuscitation of
Zisco. The initial investment for this phase will amount to $750
million,"" Industry and Commerce Minister Welshman Ncube said at
a ceremony on Wednesday, when the deal was officially signed.
 ZISCO is the first privatisation under a power-sharing
government formed in 2009 by bitter rivals President Robert
Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai.
 The investment would come as a boost for a country
struggling to attract foreign investment the government says is
needed to fix the economy after a decade of decline and
hyperinflation.
 Once a major foreign currency earner, ZISCO is now saddled
with about $240 million in debt, which Essar will take over.
 Ncube later told journalists that Essar Africa would not pay
for the shareholding in ZISCO, which he said had a value of $45
million.
 The Zimbabwean minister said ZISCO, which shut in the last
two years, is expected to produce 1 million tonnes of steel a
year, which would be sold locally and the excess exported.
 ""Our intention is that in the next 10 to 15 months we start
producing steel,"" Ravi Ruia, Essar Group vice chairman told
journalists.
 The government has said ZISCO's privatisation is excluded
from an empowerment law, which compels foreign-owned firms
including mines and banks eventually to sell at least 51 percent
shareholding to local blacks.
Ruia said Essar would eventually want to build a power
station to guarantee uninterrupted supply of electricity to the
steel maker.

 * South Korea free trade deal hailed as model
 * Asia key as U.S. hopes to double exports in five years
 By Andrew Quinn
 WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The United States will step
up efforts for free, open and transparent trade across the Asia
Pacific region as it seeks to double U.S. exports in five
years, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday.
 Clinton, addressing officials from the Asia Pacific
Economic Forum, said expanding economic engagement with the
Asia Pacific region remained a cornerstone of U.S. policy
despite doubts at home about whether the global playing field
is rigged against the United States.
 ""The United States seeks partnerships that are governed by
reasonable, rules-based approaches that give businesses from
all of our economies the chance to compete, and that are
grounded in shared principles,"" Clinton said.
 ""To citizens of my own country, who see factories closing
down at home as products continue to flow in from overseas, and
who wonder whether economic integration will hurt their
families in the long run, let me say this: Ensuring that
economic engagement delivers results to the American people is
a top domestic priority.""
 U.S. President Barack Obama will host this year's APEC
summit in Hawaii in November, and Clinton said the 21-member
group could help meet challenges including rising food and fuel
prices, climate change and creating economic opportunity.
 Obama has set the goal of doubling U.S. exports in five
years as he seeks to jump-start economic growth and beat back
stubbornly high unemployment.
 U.S. officials say the booming economies of Asia are one
key to the future, although U.S. ties to the region's
heavyweight, China, remain dogged by U.S. charges that Beijing
artificially undervalues its currency to win trade advantages.
 A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
 Clinton did not mention the China trade dispute
specifically but did outline a set of U.S. priorities for the
region that underscore Washington's concerns over unfair
treatment.
 ""The United States is looking for a level playing field, an
environment in which businesses rise and fall based on honest
competition, rather than government manipulation,"" Clinton
said, adding that trade ties should be open, free and
transparent to ensure maximum rewards.
 Clinton singled out intellectual property rights and
""indigenous innovation"" -- a policy some countries adopt to
favor domestic technology -- as issues that need to be
addressed to balance competition.
 The United States hopes to finalize a free trade deal soon
with South Korea, as well as agreements with Colombia and
Panama, she said, adding the South Korean pact could be a model
for cutting tariff restrictions and improving market access.
 ""Then there are the benefits that cannot be expressed in
dollars: a closer political and strategic partnership with a
key ally that is cemented not only by shared security concerns
but by closely integrated economies,"" Clinton said.
 She said the United States would also forge ahead with the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, a growing trade group that U.S.
officials say is aimed ultimately at establishing a free trade
area across the Asia Pacific region.
 Clinton said the United States would push APEC to become
more effective through strengthening regulatory practices,
preventing technical barriers to trade and fighting poverty.

 NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - The euro was little changed
on Wednesday as initial optimism after Portugal's successful
bond sale faded amid ongoing concern about euro zone debt
problems.
 In less than a week, the euro first gained strongly on
expectations of a euro-zone interest rate hike next month but
then fell back as investors considered what higher borrowing
costs will mean to peripheral nations already struggling under
high debt burdens.
 The common currency was last flat on the day at $1.3907,
recovering from a low of $1.3855 , on electronic
trading platform EBS though off the session high of $1.3942.
 Portugal's cost of issuing two-year debt rose to its
highest since it joined the euro, highlighting the problems
facing peripheral euro zone countries and keeping alive
concerns that it will need an international bailout.
[ID:nLIS002583]
 The currency bounced off a key technical level.
 In addition to the technical support level, traders cited
talk the European Central Bank was checking Greek and Irish
government bond prices. But as London traders left their desks
and liquidity dried up, the euro continued to struggle.
 ""Euro/dollar bounced off of technical support at $1.3860 to
trade $1.3920 on talk of ECB debt buying,"" said Brad Bechtel,
managing director at Faros Trading, LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. ""The Portuguese debt auction was read as OK to
slightly good.""
 The euro had hit a four-month high of $1.4036 on Monday,
buoyed by the euro zone rate outlook, but then has struggled
until today.
 ""The elevated cost of borrowing for Portugal and Spain is
seen as unsustainable and could result in the need for
additional EU/IMF-funded bailouts,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc. in
Washington. ""Inability of policymakers in the euro zone to
agree on measures to address the crisis is keeping the single
currency broadly pressured.""
 EU SUMMIT ON FRIDAY
 The market's focus is consequently on a euro zone summit on
Friday, where 17 heads of state are expected to agree on the
next cautious steps in their bid to quell the region's debt
crisis, even as they are unlikely to announce a major
breakthrough. [ID:nLDE7270VF]
 Friday's summit is likely to only lay the ground for a
meeting of all 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 24-25 when
they hope to agree on a ""comprehensive package"" of measures
they hope may draw a line under the crisis.
 Still, the euro is seen supported by favourable interest
rate differentials, with many expecting the ECB to retain a
hawkish bias despite the debt problems in peripheral member
nations. That is in sharp contrast to U.S. monetary policy
which looks set to remain loose for some time.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 82.81 yen
, supported by a generally rising trend in U.S.
Treasury yields.

 * Players: Shell, Petrobras, Hoegh LNG, Flex LNG
 * FLNG good for developing remote offshore gas fields -Shell
 
 By Gwladys Fouche and Henrik Stoelen
 OSLO, March 9 (Reuters) - Producing liquefied gas on vessels
at sea could turn into a billion-dollar industry as engineers
develop shipboard technology to help quench Asia's thirst for
energy, industry players said on Wednesday.
 Floating production of liquefied natural gas (FLNG) is under
development -- with no projects currently operating -- and could
take off in the next decade if onshore LNG projects cannot meet
rising gas demand.
 The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the use of gas
to rise by 44 percent between 2008 to 2035, more than any other
fossil fuel, with China expected to make up about a fifth of the
global increase.
 The first FLNG project to come on stream may be Royal Dutch
Shell's Prelude scheme off Australia, which may begin producing
gas in five to six years' time, with Brazil's Petrobras also
looking into FLNG.
 ""FLNG may represent some 10 billion dollars in investments
over the next decade ... and may offer a return on investments
of 20 billion dollars over time,"" said Jarand Rystad, founder of
a Norway-based research consultancy for the oil industry.
 ""There is very high gas demand over the long term,
especially in Asia ... and they won't be able to supply from
local reserves,"" he told Reuters on the margins of a gas seminar.
Among the 160 gas fields where FLNG could be applicable
worldwide in the next decade, Rystad said, some 10 percent could
end up actually using the system. Oil majors like Shell could
run the projects or commission firms such as Norway's Hoegh LNG
or Flex LNG to do the job.
 Most promising are gas reservoirs off Australia and
Southeast Asia that are too far from land for easy transport to
processing installations onshore. Additional markets include the
waters off Canada, Brazil and Arctic Russia.
 ""In Australia there is a lot of gas that is further
offshore, so an onshore development project concept is more
challenging for those gas fields,"" said Marjan van Loon, general
manager for gas technology at Shell.
 She told Reuters the firm's interest in FLNG was not limited
to Australia: ""The whole Asia Pacific is interesting,"" she said.
 Behind Shell's push for FLNG is the thirst of Asian
countries for energy resources to fuel booming economies.
 ""What makes a project (like Prelude) tick are the
economics,"" said Van Loon. ""With the Asian market, there is big
demand for LNG and a lot of interest.""
 
 CYCLONES, FIRES AND COSTS
 There are many challenges ahead. 
 One is the oversupply of gas in today's market, which the
IEA expects to last until at least 2020. Low gas prices despite
rising demand make investing in big, complex technologies like
FLNG less attractive.
 ""There are more than enough conventional LNG projects in the
pipeline at the moment to cover the market's needs,"" said Paal
Hansen-Tangen of oil research consultancy ODS-Petrodata.
 ""So the floating LNG projects have to be more economically
viable than the traditional LNG projects to become a real
market,"" he told Reuters.
 Nor is it easy to build a giant industrial installation on a
floating vessel.
 At Prelude, Shell will use a vessel some 500 metres long and
roughly as wide as a football pitch that must resist the
cyclones that often batter the region.
 Another challenge is to limit the risk of fire and explosion
on a cramped vessel loaded with highly explosive gas. Onshore,
such risk can be limited by spreading installations over a wide
area.
 Shell says it is resolving these issues and remains upbeat
on FLNG despite the hurdles.
 ""It is a tough road,"" said Van Loon. ""But we believe it will
happen.""

 * Around 1/3 of Ivorian output sitting in warehouses
 * Smuggling from Ivory Coast likely to increase
 
 By David Brough and Ange Aboa
 LONDON/ABIDJAN, March 9 (Reuters) - An all-out civil war in
Ivory Coast would probably paralyse exports of the bulk of the
main cocoa crop in the world's largest producer, unlike the
2002-2003 war when supplies reached the world market.
 Cocoa futures prices on the ICE exchange have already
exceeded highs in the last civil war, reaching $3,775 per tonne
on March 4, as fighting between supporters of two rival
governments has intensified fears over the future of supplies.
 The main harvest starting in October could suffer as
violence forces workers, many of them impoverished migrants, to
abandon farms and flee the country due to fears for their
safety, analysts said.
 Jonathan Parkman, joint head of agriculture at Marex
Financial Ltd in London, said that in the longer term, civil war
would harm investment prospects for the cocoa industry in Ivory
Coast, which accounts for about 40 percent of global supplies.
 ""Everybody would be reconsidering whatever investment plans
they already had on the table. At best they would be shelved, if
not ripped up,"" he said.
 In the short term the risk is that around 475,000 tonnes of
beans now sitting in Ivorian warehouses -- more than 10 percent
of cocoa forecast to reach global markets this year -- could
rot.
 The beans have accumulated since presidential claimant
Alassane Ouattara, widely seen by the international community as
the winner of Nov. 28 elections, urged a cocoa export ban, which
has been largely adhered to by exporters.
 Whether the beans rot or reach the market now depends on
moves by the two presidential contenders.
 Analysts said Ouattara is likely to extend the export ban,
which runs out on March 15, in order to starve incumbent Laurent
Gbagbo of cash he needs to pay the military and civil service.
 But Gbagbo issued a decree this week for the state to take
over purchasing of beans from farmers at a set price and then
handle all exports, triggering fears stocks would be seized.
 There is no plan for now to seize stocks, but cocoa
exporters have until the end of March to ship the stored beans
and pay taxes on them or risk seizure, the sector regulator said
on Wednesday.
 
 ROTTING AT QUAYSIDE
 While the two sides make their moves and countermoves, ""We
have had stocks from the 15th or 20th of January,"" said an
industry source in Abidjan who did not want to be identified for
safety reasons. ""Quality is starting to become complicated, and
that is our greatest worry.""
 Cocoa is normally held at port for no longer than 10 days
before being loaded on a ship, but some sacks have now been kept
on the quayside for more than a month-and-a-half.
""Even without war, cocoa is rotting in the warehouses ...
which are not well adapted for long-term storage. So imagine if
there were war,"" said another industry source.
 Export companies are trying to preserve the beans from
rotting by airing them out routinely.
 A third source said, ""Every morning we open the warehouse
doors to keep the cocoa aired out, but if there is war, who will
come and do this? The cocoa will stay in the warehouse and rot.""
 Gbagbo's move to control the trade would be welcomed by many
Ivorian farmers, who would have an incentive to sell cocoa to
authorities after the country's banking system collapsed. Many
farmers face a shortage of cash and finance, making it more
difficult to care for their trees and renew plantations.
 Gbagbo's action also has raised questions over how he could
engineer exports in the face of Ouattara's ban and sanctions by
the European Union, a leading market. He is expected to turn to
secondary markets such as Russia and Asian countries, which have
not imposed sanctions.
 ""Who do they sell it to? It does follow that Gbagbo would do
this (control cocoa trade) as his finances are being squeezed,""
said Kona Haque, an analyst with Macquarie Bank in London.
 
 ABANDONING PLANTATIONS
 Analysts said that if fighting erupted across the country,
the immediate impact on production would be limited as the
latest main crop harvest has been collected.
 The brunt of the supply and price impact would be felt when
the main crop harvest starts in October, although the smaller
mid crop which begins next month could be vulnerable.
 Analysts said wide-scale hostilities between Ouattara and
Gbagbo would also trigger an upsurge in smuggling, which has
already been taking place through neighbouring countries such as
Ghana.
But neither smuggling nor production from Cameroon, Nigeria
and Ghana, ranked the world's second-largest, would be enough to
make up for an output shortfall from Ivory Coast, analysts said.
 As for consumers, cocoa stocks in European ports are likely
to be low. Analysts say London-based merchant Armajaro, which
took a big position against the London July futures contract,
has probably sold most of the tonnage to processors by now.
Armajaro has declined comment.
 A worsening supply outlook, therefore, is likely to trigger
further price rallies, squeezing margins of chocolate makers.
 ""We're likely to see the big confectioners downsizing
chocolate bars rather than passing on big price increases to
consumers,"" the analyst with the Western trade house said.

 * France says Gbagbo decree has no legal bearing

(Adds details, background)
 ABIDJAN, March 9 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast cocoa exporters
have until the end of March to ship beans they have in stock and
pay taxes or risk seizure by Laurent Gbagbo's government, the
sector regulator said on Wednesday.
 Anoh Gilbert had said earlier there was no plan for now to
seize the stocks as part of a decree issued late on Monday under
which the state would handle all exports of cocoa from the
world's top grower.
 Exporters had been concerned that the decree included
seizure of about 475,000 tonnes of beans currently in storage,
worth some $1.8 billion at current market prices near a 32-year
high.
 Gilbert said Gbagbo's government expected companies to pay
about 60 billion Franc CFA ($127 million) in taxes on about
340,000 tonnes of cocoa by the end of March and taxes on another
100,000 tonnes by the end of June.
 ""So, if by the end of that date (end-March) we are not paid,
we will start a judicial process and we will seize part of the
stocks in other to be paid, whether the beans are exported or
not,"" he said.
 A power struggle following a disputed election has strangled
the cocoa sector of the world's top grower, leaving the cocoa in
storage in the country.
 France, Britain and the United States have all condemned
Gbagbo's move to control the sector as tantamount to theft.
 ""France condemns this illegal decision by Laurent Gbagbo to
expropriate cocoa and coffee companies operating in Ivory
Coast,"" said Bernard Valero, spokesman for the French Foreign
Ministry.
 ""This decision has no legal bearing as it has been made by
authorities that have no legitimacy to take decisions on behalf
of the Ivory Coast,"" he said.

 (Adds more quotes, context)
 By Steve Gutterman
 MOSCOW, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden
praised Dmitry Medvedev's ""personal leadership"" on Wednesday and
backed Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organisation, but
stopped short of suggesting a timeline.
 Medvedev, hosting Biden for a visit designed to bolster
economic ties after two years of improving relations under
President Barack Obama's ""reset"" with Moscow, said Russia wants
membership this year.
 ""Because of your personal leadership ... I think we've
proved the skeptics wrong: We have made great progress in the
last two years,"" Biden told the Russian president.
 The United States has demonstratively played up Medvedev's
role in contrast to its much cooler approach to Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, who remains Russia's preeminent leader and has
hinted he may return to the presidency in a March 2012 vote.
 With elections drawing nearer in both countries, the White
House and the Kremlin are eager to keep up momentum in relations
after the linchpin of the ""reset"", the New START nuclear arms
reduction treaty, came into force last month.
 The United States ""wants to continue the progress we've made
-- this time on the economic front,"" Biden said. He earlier
presided over the signing of a deal for Russian airline Aeroflot
to buy jets from U.S. planemaker Boeing Co. [ID:nN09242463]
 Russian-U.S. trade totalled $23.5 billion in 2010, just 3.8
percent of Russia's total external trade.
 Earlier, he told a business roundtable: ""We strongly support
Russia's accession to the WTO"" and cited progress on issues
including agricultural trade and intellectual property rights. 
 
 HURDLES TO CHANGE
 Medvedev said ""economic relations lag substantially behind""
political ties"" with the United States in part because Russia
remains outside the WTO 18 years after first seeking entry. 
 Referring to WTO accession, he told Biden: ""I hope these
processes will be completed this year, with the active support
of the United States.""
 Biden offered vocal support for Medvedev's drive to
modernise Russia's energy-reliant economy -- a key item on the
agenda of a leader critics say has little to show for three
years in power.
 ""We fully support President Medvedev's vision of a nation
powered by innovation,"" Biden told a meeting of American and
Russian business leaders earlier in the day.
 But he emphasised the need for practical steps to ""improve
the investment climate, implement the rule of law and tackle
endemic corruption"".
 ""Investors are looking for assurances that the legal system
treats them fairly,"" Biden said.
 Medvedev has said reforming Russia's courts and fighting
graft are top priorities since Putin steered him into the
Kremlin in 2008, but analysts say they have seen little change.
 The business gathering was at Skolkovo, a site outside
Moscow where the Kremlin plans a high-tech hub using tax breaks
and other incentives to lure investment and nurture innovation.
 
 TALKS ON LIBYA
 U.S. officials said Biden would also have ""serious
discussions"" with Moscow about the unrest in Libya and the Arab
world as well as cooperation on missile defence.
 As the United States and NATO weigh potential military
options against Libya, including a no-fly zone, Russia has
warned it opposes military intervention.
 Russia has veto power as a permanent U.N. Security Council
member, and can use that clout to temper Western policy and
influence global actions, as it has done on Iran.
 Biden was due to meet Putin on Thursday as well as
opposition leaders and activists, sending a message that the
United States is not ignoring critics who accuse Russia's
leaders of curtailing democracy and human rights.

Schaeuble will attend a G20 seminar on reshaping the global
monetary system this month, making Germany one of the first
countries to confirm top-level participation after hosts China
and G20 chair France.
 Paris has placed discussion of how to reform the
international monetary system at the centre of its year-long
presidency of the G20, and China's position will be key for how
much progress France can make on its goals.
 The gathering in Nanjing on March 31 is expected to include
academics, economists, central bankers and finance ministers. 
 The German Finance Ministry said on Wednesday that Schaeuble
would also visit Beijing. Germany co-chairs a G20 working group
on the world monetary system with Mexico, which will chair the
G20 in 2012.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is chairing the G20
this year, has said he intends to travel to Nanjing to attend
the conference. France will also send Finance Minister Christine
Lagarde and central bank Governor Christian Noyer to the one-day
meeting, French officials said.
 Paris is still liaising with G20 partners over how many
ministers and central bankers from other countries will attend
the seminar.
 As G20 chair, France is also seeking measures to address
volatility in commodity prices and to complete a framework for
tackling global economic imbalances, such as China's large
current account surplus and Washington's big fiscal deficit.
 At a G20 summit in Paris last month, China was reluctant to
include exchange rates and currency reserves in a list of
indicators to be used to gauge imbalances, making a hard-fought
compromise necessary for finance ministers to eventually reach a
deal.
 But China announced that it would host the seminar on reform
of the international monetary system in late March, with the
involvement of the central bank and foreign ministry.

 NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - The euro recovered from lows
on Wednesday, bouncing off a key technical level after
Portugal's successful bond sale, though investors were cautious
on whether gains mark the resumption of the euro's recent
advance.
 In the past week, the euro first gained strongly on
expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month but
then fell back as investors considered what higher borrowing
costs will mean to peripheral nations already struggling under
high debt burdens.
 Portugal's cost of issuing two-year debt rose to its
highest since it joined the euro, highlighting the problems
facing peripheral euro zone countries and keeping alive
concerns that it will need an international bailout.
[ID:nLIS002583]
 In addition to the technical support level, traders cited
talk the European Central Bank was checking Greek and Irish
government bond prices as being behind the euro's bounce.
 ""Euro/dollar bounced off of technical support at $1.3860 to
trade $1.3920 on talk of ECB debt buying,"" said Brad Bechtel,
managing director at Faros Trading, LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. ""The Portuguese debt auction was read as okay to
slightly good.""
 The common currency was up 0.1 percent at $1.3924,
recovering from a low of $1.3855 , on electronic
trading platform EBS. Strong German output data also supported
the euro. [ID:nLDE72819V].
 The euro had hit a four-month high of $1.4036 on Monday,
buoyed by the euro zone rate outlook, but then has struggled
until today.
 ""The sovereign debt crisis is the euro's Achilles heel for
some time now and while we remain bullish on the euro, it has
to close above $1.40 for it to push higher."" said Tom Levinson,
a foreign exchange strategist at ING.
 Still, the euro is seen supported by favourable interest
rate differentials, with many expecting the ECB to retain a
hawkish bias despite the debt problems in peripheral member
nations. That is in sharp contrast to U.S. monetary policy
which looks set to remain loose for some time.
 EU SUMMIT ON FRIDAY
 The market's focus is consequently on a euro zone summit on
Friday, where 17 heads of state are expected to agree on the
next cautious steps in their bid to quell the region's debt
crisis, even as they are unlikely to announce a major
breakthrough. [ID:nLDE7270VF]
 Friday's summit is likely to only lay the ground for a

 * Germany opposed to bond buys, cuts in EU loan rates
 * U.S. concerned about backlash if crisis erupts again
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt and Noah Barkin
 LONDON/BERLIN, March 9 (Reuters) - The snail-like progress
of European Union talks on fixing the bloc's debt troubles has
begun to concern investors, raising the risk that the crisis
will return with full force in the weeks ahead.
EU leaders are holding a number of meetings to come up with
a permanent plan, including a summit-to-prepare-for-a-summit on
Friday, a finance ministers conclave to work on the detail next
week, and a big, supposedly culminating summit on March 24/25.
 The slow pace has left investors to try and price in an
outcome that is by no means certain, exemplified by the gap in
borrowing costs for Germany and debt-ridden outliers beginning
to blow out again and the cost of insuring that debt rising.
 Yield spreads between Greek and German bonds, for example,
were at close to two-month highs earlier this week. Spreads have
also widened sharply for Portugal, the candidate seen as most
likely to follow Greece and Ireland in taking an EU/IMF bailout.
 ""There is an element of frustration in the markets that the
European process takes so long,"" said John Stopford, head of
fixed income at Investec Asset Management.
 ""The strategy seems to have been all along to do as little
as possible and be reactive. We are inching towards some form of
meaningful burden sharing. But it is ... at a piecemeal pace.""
 Since the euro zone's paymaster Germany signalled in January
that a ""comprehensive package"" of new anti-crisis measures would
be delivered at the late March summit, market expectations of a
far-reaching deal have risen and stress on bonds initially
eased.
 Berlin appears ready to back an increase in the effective
lending capacity of the bloc's rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), enabling it to lend the
full 440 billion euros it was originally intended to have.
 But it is sceptical about changing the terms of an EU/IMF
bailout that Ireland signed up to only a few months ago and a
substantial extension of the EU loan maturities for Ireland and
Greece also appears unlikely.
 Perhaps most significantly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel
opposes giving the EFSF powers to buy the bonds of stricken euro
zone peripheral countries on the secondary market.
 
 FALLING SHORT?
 All this suggests the package due later this month may fail
to address the chief concern of investors -- the risk of a Greek
debt restructuring and of contagion to Portugal and beyond.
 Nobody seems to doubt that record Portuguese borrowing costs
with 10-year yields above 7.5 percent are unsustainable and will
require Lisbon to seek outside help if they do not fall.
 Treasury Secretary Carlos Pina told Reuters on Wednesday
that record yields required ""urgent measures at the European
level to make the European Financial Stability Facility more
flexible"".
 As of Thursday, Markit said the cost of insuring Greek
government debt against default had widened to 1,033 basis
points, with Ireland out at 585 bps and Portugal at 500.
 If markets are disappointed by any EU deal and react
forcefully, investors could begin betting on multiple debt
defaults and a fracturing of the 12-year old currency zone.
 ""The market response will be driven around whether it is
pain relief or cure,"" said David Shairp, global strategist for
JPMorgan Asset Management.
 The European Union often works at glacial pace, given the
need to forge consensus among 27 member states, 17 of which are
in the euro zone.
 But markets are impatient. This week they clobbered Greece
instantly after its sovereign ratings were downgraded by Moody's
with barely a thought for what the EU might do to prop up Athens
in the coming weeks.
 Moody's said the chance of a Greek restructuring had risen.
 As Mark Grant of U.S. firm Southwest Securities said in a
note this week: ""The European Union can manipulate yields and
prices but in the longer game it is the investment community
that will make the decisions.""
 What EU leaders may view as a finely crafted political
compromise at the coming meetings could easily be seen by
markets as a fudge that does not do the job.

 PRICED IN ... OR NOT
 Given this, it seems unlikely that when the EU eventually
agrees a permanent crisis package that there will be a huge sigh
of relief from investors and an accompanying settling down of
the bond market.
 And the longer the euro area's debt woes linger, the greater
the chance that investors turn their attention to indebted
countries outside the bloc, like the United States.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner jetted to Germany
for a day of meetings this week to express Washington's concerns
about the looming summits in person. U.S. President Barack Obama
raised the issue with Merkel in a phone conversation late last
month.
 ""There is room for disappointment,"" said Klaus Wiener, head
of research at Generali Investments in Cologne. ""The hurdles for
surprising markets positively are very high.""
 Nicolas Veron, senior fellow at the Brussels-based think
tank Bruegel, sees two scenarios for market reaction.
 One is that everything is being priced in -- which could
explain why market stress has resurfaced -- and that the
eventual decision will have no major impact.
 His other scenario is that markets have not actually paid
much attention yet.
 ""The market only focuses on one thing at a time. In recent
weeks the focus has been on the situation in the Middle East and
North Africa. A lot of investors consider the (EU) negotiating
process ... opaque,"" he said.
 That could open the door to a far more adverse reaction than
is currently being seen.
 ""Authorities normally kick things down the road, and that
can be good because time heals,"" billionaire investor George
Soros told a breakfast meeting in Paris on Wednesday. ""But now
it is not good because time is working against us.""

 BERLIN, March 9 (Reuters) - Germany's BGA trade organisation
forecast on Wednesday the nation's exports and imports would
bounce back beyond pre-economic crisis levels this year, and
that exporters faced a significantly stronger euro in the long
term.
 The BGA predicted German exports would see nominal growth of
up to 9 percent to 1.046 trillion euros this year, while imports
would rise 12 percent to 903 billion.
 That meant Germany's trade surplus would be considerably
less this year than the 143 billion euros posted in 2010, while
its market share of world trade should rise to 9.5 percent from
about 9 percent.
 ""There are also significant risk factors for these
forecasts,"" said the BGA in a statement, citing the Libyan
crisis because of the threat to energy supplies and its
potentially destabilising effect on the region.
 It also cited the debt and confidence crisis in some euro
zone countries.
 BGA President Anton Boerner told a news conference he also
expected the euro to strengthen significantly in the long run.
 The euro was down 0.25 percent at $1.3871 , retreating
further from a four-month high of $1.4036 hit in Monday reached
on expectations that the European Central bank will raise
interest rates in April.
 According to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists
published last week, the euro is seen dipping to around $1.34 in
three months and $1.33 in six, before strengthening to $1.35 in
one year. [ID:nLDE72024F]

 By Christina Fincher and Peter Griffiths
 LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Britain's global goods trade gap
narrowed in January to its smallest in nearly a year with record
exports of oil helping drive a recovery from its worst reading
on record in December.
 The improvement will provide some relief to policymakers who
have pinned their hopes of economic recovery on Britain
exporting more at a time of weak domestic demand.
 Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed to 7.06 billion
pounds in January from 9.69 billion pounds in December which was
the worst reading since monthly records began in 1980.
Economists had forecast a more modest fall to 8.5 billion
pounds.
 December's deficit was revised higher, a move the statistics
office attributed to a reassessment of seasonal factors and
revised data from the tax authority and other agencies.
 However, economists cautioned that monthly trade figures
were notoriously volatile and December's severe winter weather
may have amplified the move.
 ""Today's number is encouraging but there is clearly a lot of
short term volatility in these figures"" said Ross Walker, an
economist at RBS.
 ""The underlying positive is still that trade is making only
a relatively modest contribution to GDP growth.""
 A contraction in the economy in the fourth quarter --
fuelled by the cold weather -- was one reason why policymakers
were reluctant to raise interest rates at the Bank of England's
last meeting. A better first quarter is widely expected to
trigger the rise by June.
 December was Britain's coldest in a century and heavy
snowfall disrupted road, rail and air transport. The Office for
National Statistics said it was hard to gauge exactly what
impact the weather had made.
 Britain's total trade deficit, which includes services,
narrowed to 2.95 billion pounds from December's 5.48 billion
pounds -- its narrowest since February 2010.
 The improvement was largely due to a pick-up in export
volumes, which rose 6.1 percent on the month, excluding oil and
erratic items. Import volumes on this measure rose 1.9 percent.
 There were record levels of exports in oil, intermediate
goods, and the ""food, drink and tobacco"" category.
 The oil balance swung to a surplus of 118 million pounds
from a deficit of 727 million pounds in December, aided by
record exports of 3.56 billion pounds.
 However, economists questioned how sustained the improvement
would prove to be and said it was too early to be confident that
a long-awaited rebalancing of Britain's economy was taking
place.
 ""The sharp improvement in the UK's trade deficit in January
mainly reflects temporary factors, rather than signalling that
net trade is now giving strong support to the recovery,"" said
Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics.

 By Caroline Copley
 LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro erased
early losses to trade higher on Wednesday after positive
corporate results and indications for a firmer start on Wall
Street outweighed concerns about high oil prices.
 Portugal sold two-year bonds at auction, but its cost of
borrowing was the highest since it joined the euro and the
government said yields on its debt were unsustainable in the
long run without Europe-wide action.
 Germany's flagship carrier Deutsche Lufthansa announced a
bigger than expected 2010 dividend after a one-time tax effect
boosted its bottom line, sending its shares higher by more than
three percent.
 Lufthansa's results also reminded investors of healthy
corporate earnings in a global economy that is still expected to
grow at a reasonable rate of 4 percent this year.
 ""Appetite for risk has risen, which has been supporting
equities ... Overall, stocks are still relatively undervalued,""
said Francis Ailhaud, CEO of Groupama Asset Management, which
has 90 billion euros in assets under management.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index and
the Thomson Reuters global stock index rose 0.2 percent. The
MSCI index is only ticks away from its 30-month high hit in
mid-February.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.3 percent, erasing
earlier losses, while MSCI's emerging equity index also gained
0.3 percent.
 Lufthansa said it would propose paying shareholders a
dividend of 0.60 euros per share, almost 40 percent more than
the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus of 0.43 euros.
 U.S stock futures were up a quarter percent, pointing to a
higher open on Wall Street after strong gains on Tuesday.
 Brent crude rose 0.4 percent to $113.52 a barrel after news
that heavy fighting in Libya had forced the shutdown of one of
its biggest refineries.
 U.S. crude briefly rose to $105.19 before turning 0.1
percent lower on the day, near this week's 2-1/2 year high.
 Investors have been concerned that a recent spike in oil
prices may fan inflation and hurt the global economic recovery.
 However, Reuters calculations show oil will have to reach as
high as $191 to wipe out world growth, based on the assumption
that a $10 percent rise in oil prices trims global growth by
around 0.5 percent.
 
 PORTUGAL IN FOCUS
 Portugal's cost of borrowing at its two-year bond auction
rose to 5.993 percent from 4.086 percent in an auction last
September.
 Filipe Silva, debt manager at Banco Carregosa in Porto said
Portugal's yield curve was almost flat, with investors failing
to determine the premium they should receive for each maturity.
 ""This happened in Greece and in Ireland before the
bailouts,"" he said. ""We are still not at the levels that require
a bailout, but we are quickly approaching these levels.""
 Portugal's Treasury Secretary Carlos Pina said after the
auction that it did not need international aid which the market
sees as all but inevitable.
 Markets have piled pressure on peripheral debt this week
with the yield on 10-year Portuguese government bonds hitting a
new euro lifetime high of 7.78 percent. The cost of insuring
Portugal's debt against default rose 14 basis points to 500 bps.
 Spanish and Italian 10-year yield spreads versus benchmark
German Bunds hit their highest levels since mid-January. March
bund futures were steady.
 The euro reversed early losses to rise 0.2 percent to
$1.3935 as doubts grew that Friday's European summit would quell
concerns about the region's fiscal problems.
 The 17 heads of state are expected to agree on the next
cautious steps in their year-long effort to quell the region's
debt crisis but are unlikely to produce a breakthrough.
 The U.S. dollar fell 0.3 percent against major currencies.

 * Says mine tax laws on track for 2011 passage
(Adds details, quotes)	
 By Rob Taylor	
 CANBERRA, March 9 (Reuters) - Chinese firms should have more
success getting investments in Australia's mining sector
approved in future because they now understand how to navigate
the process, Australian Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said
on Wednesday.	
 China's commercial ties with Australia have been marred by
controversy, with Canberra rejecting some takeover bids by
Chinese state-owned firms. Chinese investors, in turn, have
complained of confusion over the foreign-investment regime.	
 Ferguson said past rejections that have ignited diplomatic
tensions should increasingly be rare.	
 ""The so-called tension has largely disappeared. It's all
about a learning process and they have a properly focused
understanding on how to actually succeed with the investment,""
Ferguson told Reuters in an interview.	
 ""You look at the investment over the last three years out of
China (into Australia). It's huge across a range of commodities,
from magnetite (iron ore), to coal, to uranium, LNG. They've had
a lot of success.""	
 
 Australia has been the biggest target for Chinese investment
over the past five years, with direct investments worth more
than A$16 billion, according to Australia's Treasury Department.
Chinese interest has widened from resources into real estate,
financial services and power generation.	
 China also buys more than a quarter of Australian exports,
having overtaken Japan as the country's largest trading partner
in early 2009. Two-way trade has now passed A$100 billion, up
from A$57 billion in 2009.	
 But the difficulty some Chinese firms have had in sealing
deals has soured ties.	
 In 2009, China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Co was blocked from
buying a controlling stake in rare earths miner Lynas Corp.
. Australia also blocked China's Minmetals bid for Oz
Minerals' Prominent Hill copper and gold mine because
the mine was too close to a defence rocket range.	
 Ferguson said he now met frequently with China's ambassador
to Canberra, while Chinese officials also held discussions prior
to lodging applications with Canberra's secretive Foreign
Investment Review Board, which scrutinises applications.	
 ""They now have discussions with FIRB even before they lodge
applications, get an assessment of what is required,"" he said.	
 China has previously lodged diplomatic complaints that
foreign investment rules prevented Chinese-backed firms from
bidding for natural resources tie-ups because rules said
state-owned enterprises would not win approval if they bid for
more than 50 percent of a company.	
 Indeed, changes to Australian investment rules in 2009 were
aimed at limiting Chinese investments in local mining companies,
according to confidential U.S. embassy cables obtained by
Wikileaks and reviewed last week by Reuters. 
 The Australian Treasury's head of foreign investment,
Patrick Colmer, briefed U.S. embassy officials on the new rules
in September 2009. The diplomats then reported that Australia
privately wanted to ""pose new disincentives for larger-scale
Chinese investments"", according to the cables.	
 Treasurer Wayne Swan last week denied the rules were aimed
at China, but said they were designed to clarify Australia's
position on applications from foreign state-owned enterprises.	
 Swan in 2009 announced higher thresholds for investments
that would need foreign investment approval, but he did not
change the limits on investments requiring approval from foreign
state-owned enterprises.	
 
 WOODSIDE DISPUTE	
 Ferguson, a former head of the Australian Council of Trade
Unions (ACTU), is also tourism minister and photographs of
himself with U.S. talk show queen Oprah Winfrey during a recent
Australian visit decorate his office, along with a quirky Barbie
doll in a Sydney Opera House dress.	
 He is also strongly pro-mining and his job includes
smoothing strains with Australia's powerful resources sector
over Prime Minister Julia Gillard's planned 30 percent
profits-based tax on coal and iron ore miners.	
 Ferguson said the government saw no need to intervene in a
dispute between Australian oil-and-gas producer Woodside
Petroleum and East Timor over how to develop the
Greater Sunrise gas field.	
 Woodside wants to develop the field, which straddles
Australian and East Timorese waters, by building a
multi-billion-dollar floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant.
East Timor wants an LNG plant built on its shores.	
 ""It's an issue I'm obviously paying attention to. I'm not in
a hurry. These things will sort themselves out,"" Ferguson said.	
 Ferguson also rejected proposals by Greens lawmakers to
change the tax treatment of condensate, which is a by-product of
oil and gas production from Australia's North West Shelf
project, also operated by Woodside.	
 Australia's influential Greens, which support the one-seat
minority government in both the upper and lower houses, say an
A$600 million excise exemption for condensate should be removed.	
 
 MINING TAX	
 Ferguson said he also expected mining tax laws to pass this
year after Greens took the balance of power in the upper house
Senate in July.	
 Gillard will have to rely on the support of Greens in both
houses of parliament -- they have one lower house seat and will
control the upper house from July 2011. But the government says
that will not mean a stronger tax to satisfy Greens demands.	
 ""In the minds of many companies, hopefully that's the end of
the discussion,"" Ferguson said. ""We've got a fair and balanced
outcome.""	
 On the eve of last year's election and staring at political
oblivion, Gillard forged a deal with global miners BHP Billiton
, Rio Tinto and Xstrata
to cut the rate to 30 percent from 40 percent, and dropped the
tax for companies with profits of less than A$50 million ($45
million).	
 UBS estimates the effective tax rate for companies affected
would increase from 38 percent to 44 percent.	
 Ferguson said he was also aware of mining industry
complaints of severe skills shortages that are expected to
worsen over the next few years, particularly in powerhouse
resource states like Western Australia and Queensland.	
 With the government looking at a plan to allow an extra
20,000 skilled migrants into Australia, the government would
review immigration ahead of the May 10 budget, he said.	
 ""There is a wealth of opportunities out there for us as a
nation to get very talented, highly skilled young migrants,"" he
said.

 * Dollar/yen rises, but gains seen limited
(Updates prices, adds quote)	
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss	
 TOKYO, March 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell for a third
straight session against the dollar on Wednesday, with further
losses likely, as investors were unconvinced that Friday's
European summit would quell concerns about the region's fiscal
problems. 
 The U.S. dollar also rose against most of the major
currencies, helped by a retreat in oil prices. Lower oil prices
tend to help the greenback as it reduces U.S. crude oil imports.	
 Traders said short-term support for the euro is at $1.3862,
the high on Feb 2. As long as the euro stays above that level,
the uptrend for the currency remains intact, although a break
below it should target the $1.3710-12 area, last week's low.	
 The market's focus is pinned on a European Union summit on
Friday. Seventeen heads of state expected to agree on a
comprehensive pact that will attempt to overhaul the euro zone
economies, which should help to avert a future debt crisis. 
 Analysts, however, said Friday's meeting was unlikely to
yield results. For a preview on the EU summit, click on
. 
 ""The proximity to Friday's EU summit is making people
nervous about the euro,"" said David Forrester, senior currency
strategist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. ""Near term we are
bearish on the euro. We see the euro at $1.38 over a one-month
period."" 
 Barclays has remained positive on the euro over the longer
haul. It raised its forecast on the euro over a six-month and
12-month period to $1.42 and $1.45, respectively, supported by
earlier than expected European Central Bank rate hikes.	
 In late Tokyo trading, the euro was down 0.2 percent at
$1.3879, retreating further from Monday's four-month peak of
$1.4036 on electronic trading platform EBS . That jump
in the euro was a carry-over from last week's tough inflation
talk by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who surprised markets
by flagging a possible rate hike as early as next month. 
 On the charts, George Davis, chief technical analyst RBC
Dominion Securities in Toronto, said key Fibonacci levels are
currently at play, helping to limit the rally in the euro.	
 For the long term, Davis cited the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the 2008-2010 decline at $1.3960, which is acting
as resistance to the euro's advance.	
 On a medium-term basis, there was also the 61.8 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the November 2009-June 2010 decline at
$1.3898, Davis said, and on a short-term horizon, the 76.4
percent retracement of the November 2010-January 2011 slide at
$1.3948. Both levels have also curbed the euro's gains.	
 Overall, with an interest rate hike looming in the euro
zone, the euro's outlook has remained positive on a medium-term
horizon, although traders said there was caution in the options
market.	
 According to flows data from Credit Suisse, there was buying
of bearish euro option structures overnight against sterling,
the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.	
 In addition, one-month euro/dollar implied volatility edged
up on Wednesday, trading at 10.05 percent , from 9.95
percent on Tuesday. That suggested slightly higher expectations
of fluctuations in the currency's value. 
In general, volatility tends to rise when a currency is
falling.	
 The stance in the options market on the euro reflects some
nervousness among investors that upcoming ECB rate hikes could
cripple the peripheral economies in the euro zone.	
 The dollar also rose against the yen, gaining 0.3 percent to
82.80 yen , helped by a generally rising trend in U.S.
Treasury yields. On Wednesday, yields were flat, with two-year
Treasuries at 0.729 percent, while 10-year yields slipped to
3.546 percent from 3.555 percent the previous session. 
 Dollar/yen is the currency pair most sensitive to movements
in bond yields because both low-yielding units compete as the
market's favored funding currencies for the purchase of risky
assets. Any shift in the yield curve or rate expectations
typically impacts both currencies. 
 Fund managers have been buyers of dollar/yen in recent
weeks, according to UBS, although the bank said choppy U.S.
yields have limited gains in the currency pair. UBS said its
clients have bought $1 billion worth of dollar/yen so far this
year, considered paltry given the pair's deep liquidity. The
average daily volume in dollar/yen is about $140 billion. 
 The retreat in oil prices also helped the dollar's cause.
Brent crude for April delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$112.52 per barrel. That helped the greenback move higher
against the Swiss franc to 0.9366 franc , up 0.2
percent, for a second straight day of gains versus the Swiss
currency.
Currency bid prices at 1:13 a.m. EST (0613 GMT). All data taken
from Reuters calculated from the levels at 4:30 p.m.(2130 GMT)

 NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - The biggest Wall Street
insider trading criminal case in a generation goes to trial on
Wednesday, when prosecutors open their case against Galleon
Group founder Raj Rajaratnam whose arrest 16 months ago shook

until the trial and then it really can be quite different and
end up with surprising results,"" said Stuart Gasner, securities
fraud defense lawyer at Keker & Van Nest law firm in San
Francisco and a former prosecutor.	
 The selection of a jury of 12 and six alternates began on
Tuesday and is expected to be completed on Wednesday. 
 Presiding U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell sent
prospective jurors home with a warning not to read anything
about the highly-publicized case. He then told prosecutors and
Rajaratnam's multimillion dollar defense team that opening
statements would go ahead ""for sure"" on Wednesday.
[ID:L3E7E80BC]	
 Since arresting 53-year-old U.S. citizen Rajaratnam in
October 2009 and announcing criminal charges against 26 former
traders, executives and lawyers, the U.S. government has pressed
ahead with what it calls the biggest probe of insider trading in
the $1.9 trillion hedge fund industry.	
 Nineteen people have pleaded guilty in the Galleon case. It
stands apart from past insider trading investigations because of
the government's wide-scale use of phone taps. As many as 173
audio recordings will be played to the jury during the two-month
long trial.	
 Rajaratnam was mobbed by photographers and TV crews when he
walked into the courthouse on Tuesday morning and as he left at
the end of the day. Dressed in a brown coat and a suit, he said
nothing on both occasions. 
 
 Chief defense lawyer John Dowd has argued in court papers
that prosecutors have broadened the definition of insider
trading. He said a money manager's liberty should not be at risk
because he trades on a stock while knowing something about the
company.	
 The burden of proof is on prosecutors to convince the jury
that their evidence shows Rajaratnam knew he was trading on
confidential information provided by someone who had a fiduciary
duty not to disclose it. 
 In the week before the trial, U.S. market regulators and
prosecutors uncorked allegations against Rajaratnam's friend and
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta. They
described phone calls in which he tipped Rajaratnam about
confidential Goldman information before it became public.	
 Gupta faces a civil proceeding brought by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission but he has not been
criminally charged. Lloyd Blankfein and David Viniar -- the
Goldman Sachs chief executive and chief financial officer --
were on a list of people who might testify or be mentioned
during the trial.	
 The case is USA v Raj Rajaratnam, U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.

 By Sugita Katyal	
 SINGAPORE, March 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell further on
Wednesday as OPEC considered raising production, pushing up
Asian stocks, although investors remained on edge because of the
turmoil in the Middle East.	
The euro fell as worries about European sovereign debt
problems intensified following Moody's credit rating downgrade
for Greece on Monday.	
 European shares were set to fall on Wednesday after gains in
the previous session, with a Portuguese bond auction likely to
be in focus as jitters about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis
resurface. 
Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100
to open down 14 to 20 points, or as much as 0.3 percent,
Germany's DAX to open 4 to 8 points lower or as much as
0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 to open down 6 to 8
points or as much as 0.2 percent. 
 Benchmark U.S. crude futures dipped to $104.25 a
barrel, easing further from a 2-1/2 year high hit on Monday,
after Kuwait's oil minister said the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was considering boosting
supply to offset disruptions in Libya, where government forces
are trying to quash a popular uprising. 
 Brent crude declined for a third day to stand at
$112.34 a barrel at 0710 GMT, more than $7 below a 2-1/2 year
high of almost $120 reached on Feb. 24. 
 An official oil output increase by OPEC would signal the
group's determination to cap prices, but unrest in the region
has fuelled concerns about more supplies being cut off.	
 ""Oil has stopped rising for now, but it hasn't really
retreated to levels that allow aggressive buying in risky
assets, so investors will still be jittery,"" said Hiroichi
Nishi, general manager at Nikko Cordial Securities.	
 Japan's Nikkei extended gains for a second day after the
pullback in oil prices lifted Wall Street but investors remained
worried that high fuel prices could stunt global economic growth
and erode corporate earnings. 
 The benchmark Nikkei share average closed up 0.6
percent, while the broader Topix gained 0.5 percent. 
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
edged up 0.1 percent, led by gains in consumer
durables and financials.	
 The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) ended
up 0.3 percent, with banks surging ahead of the central bank's
interest rate meeting on Thursday.	
 The Bank of Korea is expected to raise rates to curb price
pressures after surprising markets by leaving rates unchanged in
February.	
 
 EURO SLIPS	
 The euro fell for a third straight session against the
dollar, with further pressure likely as investors remained
unconvinced that a European Union summit on Friday to overhaul
the euro zone economies will yield any results.	
 Concerns about Europe's debt problems have been on the rise
since Moody's cut Greece's credit ratings by three notches on
Monday, signalling more downgrades are on the way and adding to
fears that Athens will have to restructure its debt.	
 Failure to break through resistance above $1.40 prompted
investors to trim long euro/dollar positions, sending the common
currency to a low around $1.3860 overnight. 
 With the euro on the back foot, the dollar rose against a
basket of major currencies. The dollar index inched up to
76.776, pulling away from a four-month low of 76.124 set on
Monday. 
 U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday as crude prices retreated.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1 percent, while
the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.9 percent. 
 Gold steadied on Wednesday after rising to record highs as
the prospects of further unrest in oil-rich Middle Eastern
countries has driven investors to seek safe-haven assets. 
 Gold eased below $1,430 an ounce, falling further from
Monday's record high after the drop in oil prices eased some
concerns about inflation. Spot gold was at $1,425.20 an
ounce.

out of U.S. waters such as the Great Lakes, the United States
must enact stricter rules on treating ship ballast water under

 Under the agreement, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency will settle on new rules by November that will go into

conservation groups said.
 ""This settlement should prompt EPA to treat 'living
pollution' as aggressively as it would an oil spill or toxic

Council, one of the groups involved in the settlement.
 For now, ocean-going vessels entering U.S. waters such as
the Great Lakes must first flush ballast tanks in a procedure
commonly known as ""swish and spit.""
 Environmental groups and some U.S. states complained swish
and spit was inadequate, pointing to the dozens of invasive
species that have entered the Great Lakes. More effective, and
costly, techniques are available to cleanse ballast tanks of
potential invaders.
 ""This agreement moves the EPA forward to more effective

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday as
OPEC responded to the decline in Libya's crude output by
considering a hike in production for the first time in more
than two years, while the euro slipped for a second day on
renewed euro zone debt worries.
 U.S. stocks rallied as crude prices retreated after hitting
a 2-1/2-year high on Monday, easing worries the economic
recovery could be choked off. An upbeat profit forecast from
Bank of America also lifted sentiment. [ID:nN08154840]
 Asian stocks looked set to open higher, with Nikkei futures
traded in Chicago  rising 1.15 percent to 10,570.00

could still drive oil prices up and weigh on global equity
markets.
 An official output increase by the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries would signal the group's
determination to cap prices, but many oil-exporting countries
were not convinced such a move was necessary. [ID:nLDE7270Q8]
 Brent crude  prices closed down 1.72 percent, at
$113.06 per barrel, while U.S. light crude futures  ended
0.4 percent lower at $105.02.
 Financials led U.S. stocks higher after Bank of America's
profit forecast. The rise lifted Wall Street out of the
technical danger zone, with the S&P 500 jumping back above a
six-month trend line. Holding this level is a sign of
strength.
 The market ""is still trying to deal with the turmoil in the

 GREEK YIELDS AT RECORD HIGH
 The euro fell against the dollar as concerns about the debt
situation of peripheral euro zone countries increased with
expectations of an interest rate hike by the European Central
Bank next month.
 A rise in interest rates would push up borrowing costs
across the 17-country euro zone, increasing the cost of funding
for highly indebted countries.
 Concerns about Europe's debt problems have been on the rise
since Moody's cut Greece's credit ratings on Monday.
 Greece's borrowing costs spiked on Tuesday, with yields
paid by 10-year government bonds  climbing to
12.946 percent, their highest since the launch of the euro
currency.
 The euro  fell 0.5 percent to $1.3902. It had climbed
to a four-month high above $1.40 on Monday after ECB president
Jean-Claude Trichet said last week that euro-zone interest
rates could rise as early as next month, initially boosting the
appeal of the European single currency.
 ""The problem with the interest rate-driven trade and
Trichet's hawkish comments is that you have to see the other
issues behind it,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Higher rates will
be devastating for the peripheral countries.""
 Gold eased below $1,430 an ounce, falling further from
Monday's record high after the drop in oil prices eased some
concerns about inflation. Spot gold  was last at
$1,428.46.
 The price of oil, however, was still considered a wild card
in financial markets as the fighting in Libya continued.
 Expectations that the disruption to Libya's oil supply will
be prolonged drove more analysts to revise their oil price
forecasts higher on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs increased its
second-quarter 2011 Brent forecast by $4.50 a barrel to $105.
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch raised its outlook to an average
price of $122 in the second quarter, up from $86.
[ID:nLDE7270QE]
 The U.S. government's energy forecaster boosted its
full-year price forecast by $9 to $102 a barrel this year --
above the average $99.75 in 2008, when oil hit a record.
 Prices of U.S. government debt fell as investors felt
comfortable buying stocks. Some were also seeking price
concessions in this week's U.S. Treasury auctions of $66
billion in debt.
 Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds  fell 8/32,
while their yield rose to 3.544 percent. Despite the fall in
prices, the government found strong demand during Tuesday's
sale of three-year notes.

(Updates prices)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro on Tuesday on fear some euro zone states won't be able to
withstand higher interest rates, though further gains will
likely require the Federal Reserve to hint at tighter policy.
 Tough inflation talk from European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet last week pushed the euro above $1.40 on
expectations of an increase in euro zone interest rates by as
early as next month.
 Recent credit downgrades for Greece and Spain reminded
investors higher borrowing costs and a stronger currency would
make it more difficult for debt-burdened countries to boost
growth.
 ""The problem with the interest rate driven trade and
Trichet's hawkish comments is that you have to see the other
issues behind it,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Higher rates will
be devastating on the peripheral countries.""
 That helped push the euro down as low as $1.3860, extending
a retreat from Monday's four-month peak of $1.4036. It last
traded down half a percent at $1.3898.
 ""We're seeing continued euro/dollar selling from the real
money community. It feels like the market wants to target
1.3880-1.3850,"" a London-based trader said.
 The dollar also rose 0.5 percent at 82.66 yen.
 Whether the greenback can extend gains against the euro
will depend on whether the Fed hints at monetary tightening of
its own. U.S. interest rates have been near zero for more than
two years and the Fed has poured even more money into the
economy via direct purchases of Treasuries.
 ""Now the focus really shifts to the U.S.,"" said Paresh
Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA Merrill
Lynch. ""The Fed has sounded more hawkish lately, but will they
continue to do so, will they start to detail an exit strategy?
That's the big question.""
 The Fed holds its next policy meeting on March 15.
 Following a break of the $1.3862 February peak, the next
technical level is $1.3830, the low hit last Thursday before
Trichet spoke. Then the euro could be heading toward $1.35,
though investors say it is still supported by expectations the
ECB may raise interest rates next month.
 Euro zone countries are ironing out measures to resolve the
region's debt crisis in time for a European Union summit March
24-25. They will meet at a preliminary summit on Friday and any
sign leaders are struggling to reach a consensus on a debt
rescue fund could trigger more profit-taking in the euro.
 ""We have constructive expectations for reform of the EU
financial stability fund. If those aren't realized, we could
see negativity on the euro in the short term,"" said Carl
Hammer, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Analysts at Credit Agricole said a lack of consensus later
this month could trigger selling in the euro. It expects the
single currency to trade at $1.27 by May.
 Any sign the Fed is moving toward tighter policy should
also boost the dollar against the yen, Upadhyaya said, though
further unrest in Libya and the Middle East would push up oil
prices further and limit dollar gains.
 Oil prices stabilized on Tuesday after Kuwait's oil
minister said OPEC was in talks to boost oil production,
although concerns remained about possible further supply
disruptions due to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
 An early slide in oil encouraged investors to sell the
Swiss franc, which has gained broadly from safe-haven buying
throughout the political uprising in Libya. For details, see
 The euro traded at 1.3006 francs, having hit a two-week
high of 1.3041 francs on EBS.

left investors jittery. The country's oil output, normally 1.6
million barrels per day, is estimated to be down by about 1
million barrels per day.
 OPEC oil producers are consulting about a supply boost,
Kuwait's oil minister said, but many in the group remain
skeptical. [ID:nLDE7270Q8]

situation in the Middle East is still fluid,"" said Frank Lesh,

billion in debt.
 Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds  fell 8/32,
while their yield rose to 3.544 percent. Despite the fall in
prices, the government found strong demand during Tuesday's
sale of three-year notes.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro on Tuesday amid fear that some euro zone states won't be
able to withstand higher interest rates, though further gains
will likely require more aggressive Federal Reserve policy.
 Tough inflation talk from European Central Bank (ECB)
President Jean-Claude Trichet last week had pushed the euro
above $1.40, but recent credit downgrades for Greece and Spain
reminded investors higher borrowing costs and a stronger
currency would make it more difficult for debt-burdened
countries to boost growth.
 ""The problem with the interest rate driven trade and
Trichet's hawkish comments is that you have to see the other
issues behind it,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Higher rates will
be devastating on the peripheral countries.""
 That helped pushed the euro down as low as $1.3860,
extending a retreat from Monday's four-month peak of $1.4036.
It last traded down half a percent at $1.3902 .
 ""We're seeing continued euro/dollar selling from the real
money community. It feels like the market wants to target
1.3880-1.3850,"" a London-based trader said.
 The dollar also rose 0.6 percent at 82.73 yen .
 Whether the greenback can extend gains against the euro
will depend on whether the Fed hints at tighter monetary policy
of its own. U.S. interest rates have been near zero for more
than two years, and the Fed has poured even more money into the
economy via direct purchases of Treasuries.
 ""Now the focus really shifts to the U.S.,"" said Paresh
Upadhyaya, head of Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA Merrill
Lynch. ""The Fed has sounded more hawkish lately, but will they
continue to do so, will they start to detail an exit strategy?
That's the big question.""
 The Fed holds its monthly policy meeting on March 15.
 Following a break of the $1.3862 February peak, the next
technical level is $1.3830, the low hit last Thursday before
Trichet's hawkish comments. Then the euro could be heading
toward $1.35, though investors say the euro is still supported
by expectations the ECB may raise interest rates next month.
 Euro zone countries are ironing out measures to resolve the
region's debt crisis in time for a European Union summit March
24-25. They will meet at a preliminary summit on Friday, and
any sign leaders are struggling to reach a consensus on a debt
rescue fund could trigger more profit-taking in the euro.
 ""We have constructive expectations for reform of the EU
financial stability fund. If those aren't realized, we could
see negativity on the euro in the short term,"" said Carl
Hammer, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Analysts at Credit Agricole said a lack of consensus later
this month could trigger selling in the euro. It expects the
single currency to trade at $1.27 by May.
 Any sign the Fed is moving toward tighter policy should
also boost the dollar against the yen, Upadhyaya said, though
further unrest in Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East would
push up oil prices further and limit dollar gains.
 Oil prices  stabilized on Tuesday after Kuwait's oil
minister said OPEC was in talks to boost oil production,
although concerns remained about possible further supply
disruptions due to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
 An early slide in oil encouraged investors to sell the
Swiss franc, which has gained broadly from safe-haven buying
throughout the political uprising in Libya. For details, see

 The euro  traded at 1.3003 francs, having hit a
two-week high of 1.3041 francs on EBS.

 * Australia eager for TransPacific Partnership deal
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister
Julia Gillard stressed on Tuesday the urgency of finishing
long-running world trade talks this year and touted a proposed
Asia-Pacific pact as a ""large step forward"" for free trade.
 ""The (Doha) round simply must conclude this year.
Twenty-eleven is our last and best hope to get this done,""
Gillard said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one
day after meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval
Office.
 Gillard's appeal for a swift conclusion to the
nine-year-old Doha round comes one week after the U.S. Trade
Representative's office warned the talks risked becoming
irrelevant unless major developing countries like China, Brazil
and India make better offers to open their markets.
 The negotiations were launched in late 2001 with the goal
of helping poor countries prosper through trade.
 Since then, talks have been hamstrung by disagreements over
how much the United States and the EU should cut farm subsidies
and tariffs and how much major developing countries should open
their markets in exchange.
 Earlier this year, top trade negotiators set a new goal to
reach a deal by the end of 2011. But World Trade Organization
Director Pascal Lamy recently warned the pace of talks has been
too slow to reach that deadline
 Australia, as a major agricultural exporter, is eager for a
deal that would tear down farm tariffs.
 However, aided by strong demand from China and other
fast-growing markets, its economy is booming compared to the
United States. Gillard told the U.S. business group that
""Australia beat the global recession"" and emerged as ""the
world's strongest advanced economy"".
 Gillard, who will speak on Wednesday to a joint meeting of
Congress, said Australia was eager to finish talks with the
United States, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Chile, Peru, New
Zealand and Brunei on the TransPacific Partnership (TTP) pact.
 ""Every so often we take a large step forward on trade
arrangements -- and the TPP is shaping up as one of these. It
will deepen the links between some key economies of Asia and
the Americas ... and provide a platform for wider regional
trade liberalization,"" Gillard said
 Negotiators hope to finish talks on the regional free trade
agreement by the time Obama hosts the annual Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit in Hawaii in November.

 * EFG-Hermes forecasts Egypt pound at 6.30/dlr by year-end
 * Forecasts reserves to fall another $4 bln by year-end
 
 CAIRO, March 8 (Reuters) - The Egyptian central bank's
unofficial reserves plummeted by $3.3 billion in February,
bringing its total decline in foreign currency assets during the
month of political unrest to $5 billion, the bank said.
 Analysts say that with its reserves sliding, Egypt's pound
could weaken steadily and that more capital may flow out of the
country when the stock market, which has been closed since Jan.
27 due to the unrest, reopens for trade.
 The central bank said on Monday its official reserves fell a
more modest $1.7 billion in February to $33.3 billion, but
analysts said this did not reflect the magnitude of the outflow.

 Analysts say the unofficial reserves are held in deposits at
commercial banks. 
 The funds come from the sale to foreigners of government
paper with maturities of one year or less, dubbed ""hot money"",
so they may be quickly depleted when money flows out, said an
analyst outside Egypt who declined to be named.
 Analysts and bankers say both Egyptians and foreigners
transferred large amounts of money out of the country in
February, during and after the street protests that eventually
ousted former President Hosni Mubarak.
 The protests scared away tourists, foreign investors and to
a lesser extent remittances from workers abroad.
 The amount of ""deposits not included in official reserve
assets"" nose-dived to $36.5 million at the end of February from
$3.51 billion at the end of January, central bank figures
showed. At the end of December, the figure was $7.26 billion.
 ""The latter indicates that nearly all foreign investments in
T-bills left the country by end-February, leaving no further
downside risks for reserves and capital outflows on that front,""
EFG-Hermes said in a note on Tuesday.
 Some 22.5 billion Egypt pounds ($3.8 billion) in Egyptian
treasury bills matured in February, and bankers said few foreign
investors rolled over the portion they were holding, but rather
cashed out and transferred the funds into dollars and out of the
country.
 Foreign investors, taking advantage of high yields and a
relatively steady currency, had been avid buyers of Egyptian
treasury bills, and at the end of November held bills worth
61.30 billion Egyptian pounds, according to central bank data.
 EFG-Hermes said it expected the central bank to allow a
gradual weakening of the Egyptian pound against the dollar, with
the exchange rate falling to 6.30 pounds to the dollar by the
end of the year from the current 5.90 pounds.
 ""We expect the 6.00 pound level to be tested when the stock
market opens,"" it said, adding that the continued delay in
reopening the stock exchange risked encouraging even more
capital outflows.
 The stock exchange has been closed since Jan. 27 because of
political unrest.
 EFG-Hermes said also forecast that total reserves would fall
to $29 billion by the end of the year.
 BNP Paribas said a further heavy slide in Egypt's reserves
could also prompt further credit ratings downgrades.
 ""We think the pound will continue to depreciate albeit with
heavy involvement of the central bank. Should reserves drop
towards $20 billion, we would not rule out further rating
actions, especially given very poor outlook for economic growth,
which will put a strain on public finances,"" BNP Paribas wrote
in a note.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell sharply on
Tuesday as OPEC considered boosting production for the first
time in more than two years, while the euro slipped for a
second day on renewed euro zone debt worries.
 U.S. stocks rallied as the fall in crude prices eased
worries that the economic recovery could be choked off. The
recovery in stocks appeared tentative, however, as investors
feared that unrest in Libya and the Middle East could still
drive oil prices up, a day after they hit a 2-1/2-year high.
 An official oil output increase by the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries would signal the group's
determination to cap prices, but continued violence in Libya
left investors jittery. Libya's oil output, which is normally
at 1.6 million barrels per day, is estimated to be down by
about 1 million barrels per day.
 OPEC oil producers are consulting about a supply boost,
Kuwait's oil minister said, but many in the group remain
skeptical. [ID:nLDE7270Q8]
 ""At the moment, I think we just remain nervous -- the
situation in the Middle East is still fluid,"" said Frank Lesh,
a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in
Chicago. ""We'd like to see a little more clarity there, and we
certainly don't have that.""
 Brent crude  prices dropped 1.4 percent to $113.40
per barrel, while U.S. light crude futures  were 0.5
percent lower at $104.91.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes rallied after starting
the session flat. An upbeat profit forecast from Bank of
America  also supported the market.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was last up 120.45
points, or 0.99 percent, at 12,211.09, while the Standard &

 Bank of America shares shot up 4.1 percent to $14.60 on its
long-term profit forecast, which was higher than some investors
had expected. Financials led gains on the S&P 500. he S&P
financial index up 2.1 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares ended up 0.3 percent at 1,146.91 points, after seesawing
between positive and negative.
 GREEK YIELDS AT RECORD HIGH
 The euro fell against the dollar as concerns about the debt
situation of peripheral euro zone countries outweighed
expectations of an interest rate hike by the European Central
Bank next month.
 Concerns about Europe's debt problems have been on the rise
since Moody's cut Greece's credit ratings by three notches on
Monday, signaling that more downgrades are on the way.
 Greece's borrowing costs spiked on Tuesday, with yields
paid by 10-year government bonds  climbing to
12.946 percent, their highest since the launch of the euro
currency.
 The euro  fell 0.5 percent to $1.3907. It had climbed
to a four-month high above $1.40 on Monday after ECB president
Jean-Claude Trichet said last week that euro-zone interest
rates could rise as early as next month.
 A rise in interest rates would push up borrowing costs
across the 17-country euro zone, increasing the cost of funding
for highly indebted countries.
 ""The problem with the interest rate-driven trade and
Trichet's hawkish comments is that you have to see the other
issues behind it,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Higher rates will
be devastating on the peripheral countries.""
 Gold eased below $1,430 an ounce, falling further from
Monday's record high after the drop in oil prices eased some
concerns about inflation. Spot gold  was last at
$1,427.50.

(Recasts, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar for a second day on Tuesday as investors considered
what higher euro-zone interest rates will mean for peripheral
euro nations already struggling with fiscal problems.
 The euro had climbed above $1.40 in the days after hawkish
comments from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet after a policy meeting last Thursday.
 But the currency fell on Monday after Moody's slashed
Greece's debt rating by three notches and kept it on review for
a further possible downgrade. For details, see [ID:nLDE7260D6]
That followed Fitch downgrading Spain's ratings on Friday.
[ID:nLDE7230QU]
 Those announcements brought the sovereign debt problems of
some euro-zone nations back to the fore and pushed investors to
consider that while higher borrowing costs may benefit flows
into the currency, they will not be good for the nations that
have to borrow.
 Concern that euro zone leaders will fail to reach agreement
on a debt rescue fund at an initial summit on Friday also
weighed on the single currency.
 ""The problem with the interest rate driven trade and
Trichet's hawkish comments is that you have to see the other
issues behind it,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Higher rates will
be devastating on the peripheral countries.""
 The euro  fell 0.4 percent to $1.3908, extending a
retreat from a four-month high of $1.4036 hit on Monday.
Traders said stop-loss orders were triggered on the break of
$1.3940 and $1.3925 and possibly $1.3885.
 ""We're seeing continued euro/dollar selling from the real
money community. It feels like the market wants to target
1.3880-1.3850,"" a London-based trader said.
 Following a break of the $1.3862 February peak, the next
technical level is $1.3830, the low hit on Thursday before
Trichet's hawkish comments. Then the euro could be heading
towards $1.35 though investors say the euro is still supported

 SWISSIE STRUGGLES
 An early slide in oil prices encouraged investors to pare
back long positions in the Swiss franc -- which has gained
broadly from safe haven buying throughout the political
uprising in Libya.
 Oil prices  stabilised on Tuesday after Kuwait's oil
minister said OPEC was in talks to boost oil production.
 Analysts said this triggered selling in the Swiss franc,
with traders also citing franc selling by Middle Eastern names.
 The dollar jumped as much as 1 percent against the Swiss
franc before pulling back to 0.9339 francs on EBS .
 The euro  traded at 1.2988 francs, having hit a
two-week high of 1.3041 francs on EBS.
 ""There's been stabilisation of oil prices ... so there's a
backing off in risk aversion related to Middle East tension,""
said Adam Meyers, senior currency strategist at Credit
Agricole.

 * United States, Brazil clash on demands
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, March 8 (Reuters) - Sizeable gaps remain in talks on
a world trade deal and nations must redouble their efforts to
have any hope of meeting their deadline of this year to complete
the long-running Doha round, trade diplomats said on Tuesday.
 At a meeting of the World Trade Organization to review the
decade-old Doha talks, many countries said the negotiations were
making progress on technical details but what was needed was a
deal to create real market access for exporters.
 ""We don't have a problem of process, we have a problem of
substance,"" Brazil's ambassador to the WTO, Roberto Azevedo,
told reporters after the meeting. ""The fact is that we have a
very big gap in the negotiations.""
 U.S. ambassador Michael Punke told the meeting he had seen
encouraging signs in the way states were getting involved in the
talks, but sizeable substantive gaps still needed to be bridged.
 With time running out WTO members needed to be creative and
push for a reasonable deal, even if it is not perfect for all,
he said: ""The end-game is now, one way or the other.""
 Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Punke said the key
to a deal was for the big emerging economies such as Brazil,
China and India to shoulder the responsibility commensurate with
their size and growth and open their markets accordingly.
 For instance the United States wants the emerging economies
to sign up to voluntary deals in which participants eliminate or
sharply reduce tariffs in certain industrial sectors in addition
to any general cut that is agreed in import duties.
 But Azevedo said such demands effectively meant Brazil was
being asked to make deeper cuts in tariffs than had already been
largely agreed in principle. The general tariff cuts, not the
sector deals, should be the focus of the negotiation, he said.
 ""If this view prevails then we're not entering the end-game,
we're reaching the end of the game,"" he said.
 
 CURRENCY TENSIONS
 Brazil has so far been one of the main supporters of a deal
but Brazilian officials say they find it difficult to accept
calls from Washington for more market access after Brazil's
trade balance with the United States swung into a deficit of
$10.2 billion last year from a surplus of $6.9 billion in 2006,
exacerbated by the strong real and weak dollar.
 Leaders of the G20 have urged the WTO's 153 members to
conclude the Doha talks, launched in late 2001 to boost the
world economy and help poor countries prosper through trade, and
said 2011 offered a window of opportunity.
 The outlines of a deal are clear. Rich countries will open
protected farm markets and cut trade-distorting farm subsidies
while emerging economies open up markets for industrial goods
and both free up services. Poor countries will do nothing.
 But many trade officials and diplomats say the talks will
collapse or peter out if no deal is reached this year.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy told the meeting that the
talks were making progress in all areas and at all levels.
 ""However, we should not fool ourselves. Members are very
timidly engaging into 'give and takes'. Our current process --
at each and every level -- remains too slow,"" he said.
 And so far the talks had failed to produce the sort of
breakthrough that the diplomats chairing the different areas
such as agriculture and industrial goods needed to produce
revised negotiating texts.
 WTO members have agreed to produce texts in the nine main
areas by late April, narrowing existing gaps further or setting
out common positions for the first time. 
 Such texts are a precondition for reaching an outline deal
by July allowing detailed work on an agreement to be completed
by the end of the year.
 Some members say the talks should not be held hostage to yet
another self-imposed deadline.
 South Africa would rather have a successful deal that
promotes development rather than an early agreement, Trade and
Industry Minister Rob Davies said in Cape Town.
 But at Tuesday's WTO meeting many speakers said the window
of opportunity was closing fast. Hong Kong's ambassador said it
was now no wider than an arrow slit in the Castle of Chillon at
the other end of Lake Geneva.

 * Broader euro zone debt issues remain unresolved
 * Failure to reach end-March deal would escalate crisis
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, March 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders will take
the next cautious steps in their year-long effort to quell the
region's debt crisis at a summit on Friday, but the meeting is
unlikely to produce a breakthrough.
 The top item on the agenda for the 17 heads of state and
government is to agree a ""competitiveness pact"", a deal Germany
and France are pushing the rest of the euro zone to adopt to
show their commitment to overhauling their economies.
 The pact has been watered down since it was put forward by
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Nicolas Sarkozy
last month, and now looks likely to win approval from the rest
of the euro zone leaders, many of whom were alarmed by the
initial proposals.
 The more stringent elements, such as a commitment to abandon
inflation-linked wage increases, are likely to be dropped, but
there should be agreement on measures to limit public deficits,
gradually increase retirement ages to reflect demographics, and
work towards a common corporate tax base.
 Any agreement is likely be hailed by EU leaders --
particularly Germany and France -- as a major step forward in
the battle to stem the debt crisis, which has already led to
bailouts for Greece and Ireland and still threatens Portugal.
 But analysts regard competitiveness as a sideline issue that
barely nudges the euro zone closer to tackling the fundamental
problems underpinning the crisis -- bad banking debts and
heavily-indebted sovereign nations with poor growth prospects.
 ""The competitiveness pact as it stands is largely
meaningless, it's beside the point right now,"" said Simon
Tilford, chief economist of the Centre for European Reform, a
London-based think tank.
 ""The immediate issue is debt restructuring and bank
recapitalisation and they're not dealing with that.""
 Friday's summit is only likely to lay the ground for a
meeting of all 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 24-25, when
they hope to agree on a ""comprehensive package"" of measures they
hope will draw a line under the crisis.
 
 PORTUGAL BACK UNDER PRESSURE
 Measures under discussion as part of the comprehensive
package include reforms to the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro fund set up last May and
used to bail out Ireland, and the creation of the European
Stability Mechanism, a permanent fund that will replace the EFSF
from mid-2013, and more banking stress tests.
 Among issues to be resolved is whether the effective
capacity of the EFSF will be increased to its full 440 billion
euros. Because of guarantees needed for the fund to retain its
triple-A credit rating, its effective capacity is currently 250
billion euros.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For a list of steps under discussion for the package, click
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 If Germany gets the rest of the euro zone to sign up to the
competitiveness pact on Friday, there is an expectation that
that will make Berlin more disposed to agree to a strengthening
of the EFSF, which almost all other euro zone members want.
 But Merkel's political allies at home are adamantly opposed
to bolstering the EFSF, which would require more taxpayer-backed
guarantees, and neither do they want the fund to be used to buy
distressed euro zone debt, as many other countries favour.
 Merkel's coalition lost an important regional election in
Hamburg last week and is expected to lose another in
Baden-Wuerttemberg on March 27, piling pressure on the
chancellor to stick closely to what voters want, which is no
more German taxpayer funds being used for EU bailouts.
 A month ago, an enlargement of the effective lending
capacity of the EFSF looked likely, as did the possibility of
the fund being used to buy distressed euro zone bonds on the
secondary market, or to lend money to countries such as Greece
and Ireland to buy back bonds. All now look questionable.
 ""The wiggle room, the political room for manoeuvre on the
part of the Germans, is worryingly limited,"" said Tilford. 
 ""They are going to have to deliver something (on March
24-25) because the market reaction otherwise could be pretty
adverse, but I fear that very little is going to be delivered.""
 European leaders, particularly Herman Van Rompuy, the
president of the European Council, have cast the end-March
summit as a defining moment, when the euro zone finally gets on
top of a crisis that has wrought turmoil for more than a year.
 But because of German domestic politics, persistent
disagreement among member states over the best course of action,
and external factors such as the likelihood that the European
Central Bank will raise euro zone interest rates next month, the
crisis may be about to enter another, more uncertain phase.
 For months Portugal has said that it does not need EU/IMF
assistance and can continue to fund itself in the market. But if
there is no breakthrough on March 24-25, the likelihood of
Portugal needing a bailout will increase. Already the majority
of EU states believe this will happen in April.
 That points to a renewed round of pressure on the debt of
peripheral or highly-indebted euro zone states, with not only
Portugal, but Spain, Belgium and Italy in the picture.
 ""Portugal will be forced into a bailout and will
subsequently, like Ireland and Greece, be forced to restructure
its debt,"" said Tilford. ""Portugal looks very vulnerable.""

639,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2011 11:44AM ET</span>",France to improve access to strategic metals," PARIS, March 8 (Reuters) - France aims to strengthen its
access to metals deemed strategic for its economy by promoting
partnerships in exploration and recycling under the aegis of a
new committee, the country's energy and industry minister said.
Like other industrialised states, France is concerned about
its capacity to secure rare metals needed for technology ranging
from mobile phones to electric cars, given rising global demand
and a concentration of resources in countries such as China.
 The French government will launch in the next two weeks a
strategic metals committee to coordinate partNerships between
public and private actors, Eric Besson said on Tuesday in a
speech to be delivered to a seminar at the French parliament.
 ""It would be illusory and naive to think that supply of
strategic raw materials at a competitive price can be guaranteed
merely by goodwill on all sides,"" he said in a text of the
speech distributed ahead of the seminar.
 The minister stressed the role of partnerships between
operators in the French mining sector to boost exploration,
citing deep-sea research last year in the Pacific territory of
Wallis-et-Futuna involving nuclear group Areva and nickel,
manganese and alloys group Eramet.
 French officials have reportedly floated the idea of
creating a French mining giant that would absorb the uranium
mines of Areva along with Eramet, a move opposed by Eramet's
chief executive officer.
 Besson said last month that Eramet was a potential investor

council proposed turning the business into a subsidiary as part
of a separate initiative to streamline the French nuclear

 In his remarks on Tuesday, the minister also said France
would promote recycling and environmental design as a priority
in its metals policy, with plans to launch tenders this year for
projects that will receive 250 million euros ($347.5 million) in
aid as part of an expected 600 million euro investment by
different partners.

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday as
OPEC considered boosting production for the first time in more
than two years, while the euro slipped for the second day on
renewed euro zone debt worries.
 U.S. stocks rose as investors greeted the fall in oil
prices with relief, but a drop in base metals, such as copper,
drove shares of miners lower, weighing on European equity
markets.
 The recovery in stocks appeared tentative as investors
feared that unrest in Libya and the Middle East could still
drive oil prices up, one day after they hit a 2-1/2-year high.
 An official oil output increase by the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries would signal the group's
determination to cap prices, but continued violence in Libya
left investors jittery.
 OPEC oil producers are consulting about a supply boost,
Kuwait's oil minister said, but many in the group remain
skeptical. [ID:nLDE7270Q8]
 ""At the moment, I think we just remain nervous -- the
situation in the Middle East is still fluid,"" said Frank Lesh,
a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in
Chicago. ""We'd like to see a little more clarity there, and we
certainly don't have that.""
 Brent crude  prices dropped 1.45 percent to $113.37
per barrel, while U.S. light crude futures  were 0.6
percent lower at $104.80.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes traded higher after
starting the session flat.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 64.56
points, or 0.53 percent, at 12,154.59, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 6.54 points, or 0.50 percent, at
1,316.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 12.61
points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,758.24.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares was little changed at 1,144.47 points, after seesawing
between positive and negative.
 GREEK YIELDS AT RECORD HIGH
 The euro fell against the dollar as concerns about the debt
situation of peripheral euro zone countries outweighed
expectations of an interest rate hike by the European Central
Bank next month.
 Concerns about Europe's debt problems have been on the rise
since Moody's cut Greece's credit ratings by three notches on
Monday, signaling that more downgrades are on the way.
 Greece's borrowing costs spiked on Tuesday, with yields
paid by 10-year government bonds  climbing to
12.946 percent, their highest since the launch of the euro
currency.
 The euro  fell 0.59 percent to $1.389. It had climbed
above $1.40 after ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said last
week that euro-zone interest rates could rise as early as next
month.
 ""The problem with the interest rate driven trade and
Trichet's hawkish comments is that you have to see the other
issues behind it,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Higher rates will
be devastating on the peripheral countries.""

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped versus the
dollar for a second day on Tuesday as investors debated what
the outlook for higher euro zone interest rates will mean for
peripheral euro nations already struggling with fiscal
problems.
 The euro had climbed above $1.40 in the days after hawkish
comments from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet after a policy meeting last Thursday.
 But on Monday Moody's slashed Greece's debt rating by three
notches and kept it on review for a further possible downgrade
[ID:nLDE7260D6]. That followed Fitch downgrading Spain's
ratings on Friday [ID:nLDE7230QU].
 Those announcements brought the sovereign debt problems of
some euro zone nations back to the fore and pushed investors to
consider that while higher borrowing costs may be good for the
underlying currency they will not be good for the nations that
have to borrow.
 ""The problem with the interest rate driven trade and
Trichet's hawkish comments is that you have to see the other
issues behind it,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""Higher rates will
be devastating on the peripheral countries.""
 An early slide in oil prices encouraged investors to pare
back long positions in the Swiss franc -- which has gained
broadly from safe haven buying throughout the political
uprising in Libya. The dollar jumped as much as 1 percent
against the Swiss franc .
 The euro  fell 0.6 percent to $1.3888, extending a
retreat from a four-month high of $1.4036 hit on Monday.
Traders said stop-loss orders were triggered on the break of
$1.3940 and $1.3925 and possibly $1.3885.
 However, traders said buying by sovereign accounts helped
to cap the euro's losses, while options expiries due at 1500
GMT, including at $1.3900, $1.3990 and $1.4000, may keep it
hemmed.
 ""We're seeing continued euro/dollar selling from the real
money community. It feels like the market wants to target
1.3880-1.3850,"" a London-based trader said.
 Following a break of the $1.3862 February peak, the next
technical level is $1.3830, the low hit on Thursday before
Trichet's hawkish comments. Then the euro could be heading
towards $1.35 though investors say the euro is still supported
by expectations the ECB may raise interest rates next month.
 Euro zone countries are ironing out measures to resolve the
region's debt crisis in time for a European Union summit on
March 24-25. They will meet at a preliminary summit on Friday
and any sign leaders are struggling to reach a consensus on a
debt rescue fund could trigger more profit taking in the euro.
 ""We have constructive expectations for reform of the EU
financial stability fund. If those aren't realised, we could
see negativity on the euro in the short term,"" said Carl
Hammer, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 SWISSIE STRUGGLES
 Oil prices  stabilised on Tuesday after Kuwait's oil
minister said OPEC was in talks to boost oil production,
although concerns remained about possible further disruptions
in supplies due to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
 Analysts said this triggered selling in the Swiss franc,
with traders also citing franc selling by Middle Eastern
names.
 The dollar jumped as much as 1 percent against the Swiss
franc before pulling back to 0.9343 francs on EBS.
 The euro  traded at 1.2972 francs, having hit a
two-week high of 1.3041 francs on EBS.
 ""There's been stabilisation of oil prices ... so there's a
backing off in risk aversion related to Middle East tension,""
said Adam Meyers, senior currency strategist at Credit
Agricole. ""That backing off has caused the Swiss franc to
slide.""

 TORONTO, March 8 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was
slightly softer against the U.S. currency on Tuesday and could
be ripe for a steep fall if crude prices slide from 2-1/2 year
highs fueled by unrest in Libya and oil disruption worries.
 Stuck in a well-defined range recently between
C$0.97-C$0.98, market players say oil could be the catalyst
that tips it outside the range.
 Crude oil prices fell after Kuwait's oil minister said OPEC
was considering boosting production for the first time in more
than two years. [O/R]
 Michael O'Neill, managing director, at Knightsbridge
Foreign Exchange, said if oil retreats to below $100 a barrel,
the Canadian dollar would probably follow suit and tumble
towards C$0.9850, a level not seen in more than a week.
 ""If oil prices retreat a bit further, the extremely short
U.S. dollar/Canada dollar positions are going to get unwound.
It's vulnerable for a correction,"" he said.
 ""I think everything that made Canada strong is priced in.
All the good news is in the current level, maybe more. I think
the market has gotten ahead of themselves.""
 At 8 a.m. (1300 GMT), the Canadian dollar was at C$0.9733
to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0274, down slightly from C$0.9729 to
the U.S. dollar, or $1.0279, at Monday's close.
 While the near-term market focus remains centered on the
price of oil and developments in Libya, several high-profile
pieces of Canadian data are still to come.
 Market players are looking for the Canadian economy to show
momentum in the recovery in both its trade and jobs figures,
due Thursday and Friday, respectively.
 If any of the data is softer-than-expected, the Canadian
dollar will likely sell off and could trim anticipation of an
interest rate hike before midyear, analysts said.
 The central bank has left its key rate unchanged at a
still-low 1 percent since September after three consecutive
rate increases last year.
 Overnight index swaps, which trade based on expectations
for the key central bank rate, imply a fully priced-in rate
increase on the bank's Sept. 7 decision date. 
 Canadian government bonds were flat across the curve,
mirroring U.S. Treasuries, which were awaiting $66 billion in
new supply this week.
 The two-year bond  was unchanged to yield of
1.853 percent, while the 10-year bond  edged up 2
Canadian cents to yield 3.351 percent.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped versus the
dollar on Tuesday, pausing from a rally spurred by expectations
of a euro zone interest rate rise and raising the possibility of
a downward correction on concerns about euro zone debt problems.
 An early slide in oil prices also encouraged investors to
pare back long positions in the Swiss franc -- which has gained
broadly from safe haven buying throughout the political uprising
in Libya.
 The dollar jumped as much as 1 percent against the Swiss
franc  while the euro lost steam after rallying to a
four-month high above $1.40 on expectations the European Central
Bank may raise interest rates next month. Near-term support is
seen at $1.3862, the previous three-month peak hit in early
February.
 ""As oil has come off people have squared some of their
positions and now we could see the euro continue to edge a bit
lower,"" said Adrian Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds.
 With a euro zone rate rise in April largely priced in and
positioning data showing currency speculators have ramped up
their long euro positions, some in the market say the euro is
ripe for a short-term correction. [IMM/FX]
 However, traders said buying by sovereign accounts helped to
cap the euro's losses, while options expiries due at 1500 GMT,
including at $1.3900, $1.3990 and $1.4000, may keep it hemmed
within a range until then.
 The euro  fell 0.4 percent to $1.3905, extending a
retreat from a four-month high around $1.4036 hit on Monday.
Traders said stop-loss orders were triggered on the break of
$1.3940 and $1.3925, with more reported at $1.3885. 
 ""We're seeing continued EUR/USD selling from the real money

 * EU states, diplomats indicate they will oppose plan
 * Emerging southern economies gain weight on FDI stage
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, March 8 (Reuters) - A wave of overseas
acquisitions of European assets has triggered a call in the
European Union for foreign bids to be vetted, but opposition to
such a move is strong and new controls will be hard to sell.
 Many EU diplomats and senior officials have dismissed a
written proposal by two European Commissioners to set up a
high-level board with powers to reject bids by foreign companies
or investment funds looking to buy EU companies or other assets.
 Italy's Antonio Tajani and France's Michel Barnier suggest
the EU consider creating a centralised committee -- like those
in the United States, Canada, Japan, China and Australia -- to
vet foreign bids on strategic grounds.
 Such a body would replace Europe's existing patchwork of
national oversight bodies, creating a more unified vetting
process, they wrote in a letter to EU Commission President Jose
Manuel Barroso, sources who have seen the letter said.
 The proposals from the commissioners in charge of industry
and the single market underline concern among some senior EU
officials about unchecked foreign investment, particularly from
China, India, Russia and Brazil.
 But the pushback against their ideas also shows how deep the
differences are among European policymakers over managing
foreign investment flows, and whether critical sectors such as
banking, telecoms, automobiles and steel should be protected.
 ""We see no benefits for Europe in trying to restrict inward
investment, which promotes the availability of risk capital and
employment in Europe,"" said Joakim Reiter, head of trade policy
at Sweden's embassy to the EU in Brussels.
 National authorities in the Netherlands, Britain and
Scandinavia are traditionally open to foreign investment,
mergers and acquisitions while French and Italian authorities
have at times moved to protect national interests.
 Critics of foreign direct investment warn that Europe risks
giving up precious technical know-how and sectors of strategic
importance to unknown investors. Advocates defend it as critical
to Europe's ability to emerge stronger from financial crisis.
 
 RATTLED
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy has aruged that the EU
should not be naive on trade and investment and should demand
reciprocal rights for its own firms. EU officials are debating
whether to make access to lucrative EU public works contracts
conditional on reciprocal openings by countries such as China,
India and Russia.
 EU industry was rattled last year when Chinese firm Xinmao
beat all EU offers for Dutch cable maker Draka, prompting fears
that the bid -- and others in Europe's high-tech sector -- might
be backed by state funds.
 Although Xinmao eventually withdrew its offer, the incident
highlighted Europe's diverging approaches to foreign investment.
 An EU committee could forge a single approach and integrate
existing EU rules on general and energy-related acquisitions,
Tajani and Barnier's letter says, according to sources.
 EU officials confirm Barroso received the letter and say it
will be discussed later this month. But trade experts see it as
a dangerous precedent that could be protectionist.
 A British government source told Reuters that London would
oppose tighter controls, and retailers are also sceptical.
 ""The idea of assessing investment is a dangerous premise
because investment is a market phenomenon,"" said Jacques
Pelkmans, director of economics at the College of Europe in
Bruges.
""A marginal check may be necessary if a sovereign wealth
fund that's not transparent or that's politically motivated
invests in sensitive areas. But overall I would have to see a
good, serious proposal giving evidence why this is necessary.""

 PROTOCOL BREACH
 Some EU officials say the Barnier-Tajani initiative not only
breached protocol by reviving an issue Barosso had dismissed,
but also conflicts with a drive by the 27-country bloc to make
nroads into investment markets in emerging economies.
 The Lisbon Treaty granted the Commission power to negotiate
investment treaties with third countries from 2009. Brussels
announced last year it wanted such agreements with China, South
Korea, India, Brazil and Russia in the hope of helping EU
businesses set up production plants and tap markets overseas.
 ""The EU is trying to invest in a number of emerging
countries as we speak,"" said Stefan Wengler, director of the
Foreign Trade Association, a retail and import federation.
 ""We can't then start looking into whether foreign investment
should be allowed. That would be preposterous,"" he said.
 European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, in charge of
prying open foreign investment markets for EU businesses, cast
doubt on any early progress on an EU investment vetting board.
 ""That won't happen next week. Maybe next year,"" he joked.
 Such quips are getting louder in Brussels and in European
capitals. But Tajani and Barnier are also trying to address a
real rise in inward investment flows from emerging economies.
 The stock of EU businesses and assets held by foreign
investors grew by 1.1 trillion euros between 2004 and 2009,
rising to 2.7 trillion euros, according to EU data.
China and Hong Kong held 32.5 billion euros worth of EU
businesses and assets in 2009, more than twice the 14.6 billion
euros they held in 2004, while India's stock of EU investments
rose almost tenfold to 5.5 billion euros.

 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, March 8 (Reuters) - A litany of back-stabbing at
Europe's top aerospace group is exposed in leaked U.S. cables,
which show American diplomats avidly collecting details on the
cracks in U.S. planemaker Boeing's main rival.
 Dozens of pages of diplomatic reports reveal how feuding
executives at Airbus parent EADS gave U.S. diplomats a
running commentary on Franco-German rifts between 2005 and 2009.
 The period coincided with a sharp rise in public tensions
between Airbus and Boeing in a spat over subsidies, market
battles for orders and a contest to sell tankers to the U.S.
 The cables, obtained by the WikiLeaks website and made
available to Reuters by a third party, shed new light on
political cross-currents that have rarely been stilled in EADS.
 Their disclosure comes as the group enters another sensitive
phase in its history, triggered by a recent decision by German
shareholder Daimler to reduce its 22.5 percent stake.
 The proposed sale has raised questions over how EADS is
governed and the future of a shareholder pact designed to limit
the influence of the French state. EADS was forged from a merger
of French, German and Spanish aerospace assets in 2000, but the
pact means power is shared equally between France and Germany.
 Britain originally had a direct 20 percent stake in Airbus
through BAE Systems. When BAE sold this back to EADS,
the cable shows the British defence company would not be missed
by its erstwhile partners: ""Good riddance"" was the response of
one German EADS executive.
 Other dispatches show executives worrying about industrial
espionage by China, politicians fretting about Russia's
intentions when it bought a stake in EADS and a leading French
industrialist's frustration with the French president.
 At a lunch in 2005 with the U.S. ambassador to Paris, core
shareholder and EADS co-chairman Arnaud Lagardere unleashed a
blunt critique of then French President Jacques Chirac.
 ""Lagardere opined that Chirac messes up everything he gets
involved in,"" according to an account graded ""confidential"".
 Lagardere SCA is a media group that represents
both itself and the French government on the EADS board
under the complex pact, which also includes Daimler.
 The pact, according to one cable, created ""an imbroglio
between political interests and market participants that has
proved difficult to unravel, vesting representation of national
interests in private shareholders...both of which are in the
process of exiting the business"".
 At his 2005 lunch, Lagardere reportedly told the U.S. envoy
he had a 5-8 year horizon for shedding the stake, but that a
Chirac election victory in 2007 would hasten his exit, while a
Sarkozy victory ""would probably mean the later timeline"".
 Chirac did not stand for re-election and Sarkozy, to whom
Lagardere is considered to be close, succeeded him in 2007.
Lagardere has since halved its 15 percent stake.
 EADS declined to comment on the cables while Lagardere,
which said recently that nothing would happen to its stake before
2012, did not respond to requests for comment.
 
 MEET THE PLANEMAKERS
 U.S. diplomats did a thorough job of reporting on aerospace
issues back to Washington, but were kept especially busy as a
sounding board for EADS staff at a time when the company was in
crisis following delays to the A380 superjumbo jetliner.
 The delays wiped a quarter off the company's share price in
June 2006 and sparked tensions between France and Germany. The
turmoil came hard on the heels of another turbulent period
during which the French were split over management changes, with
Lagardere reluctantly bowing to Chirac's choice of CEO.
 By mid-2006, cables depicted a company at war with itself.
 German EADS officials in 2006 described EADS co-chief
executive Noel Forgeard, an ex-Chirac aide, as an
""over-ambitious maniac"" according to a dispatch which noted
their frustration ""under the stoic German face of EADS"".
 Forgeard, who was dismissed in 2006 over the A380 delays and
has publicly blamed Airbus managers in Hamburg for the crisis,
did not respond to requests for comment.
 The debacle upset attempts by BAE Systems to sell its Airbus
stake, and the cables show its partners were not sympathetic.
 ""BAE had been a schizophrenic partner anyway, never quite
knowing if it was a European company or a quasi-U.S. firm,"" the
Munich consul quoted ""senior EADS officials"" as saying in 2006.
EADS and BAE are still partners in missile manufacturer MBDA.
 A BAE spokesman said it had taken the decision to exit
Airbus ""on the basis of the best interests of our shareholders"".
 Most cables concern contacts with EADS in Germany. But in
France, the U.S. consul in Toulouse, where Airbus is based, was
talking to suppliers and keeping tabs on the Airbus grapevine.
 In one 2008 report the consul passed on staff gossip,
without evidence or commentary, that one of the planemaker's
executives was a ""spy"". The existence of such gossip was
presented as evidence of the toxic atmosphere inside the group.
 Airbus spokesman Rainer Ohler declined comment on specific
claims and said Airbus had regular and cordial contacts with the
Toulouse consul. ""He is here so he can also see and hear what is
going on, including the gossip and the rubbish,""he said.
 When a local newspaper accused the consul of gathering
intelligence on Airbus, a cable detailed steps taken to deny any
snooping, coupled with background on the paper and its editor.
 Deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner told Reuters
""American Presence Posts"" in provincial cities like Toulouse
exist to allow the U.S. to build stronger ""economic, cultural
and political ties with the French people beyond Paris"".
 Tensions within EADS meanwhile eased after French and
German leaders intervened to simplify its structure in 2007. But
Washington was briefed repeatedly on the risk of new problems
arising from any damage to the ""politically correct"" equilibrium
set up between France and Germany when EADS was founded in 2000.
 
 CHINESE RISK
 The cables also reveal persistent U.S. concerns over whether
Airbus would seek subsidies and worries within the European
company over how to do business with China.
 In 2006, an executive with EADS helicopter unit Eurocopter
told U.S. officials that EADS was ""aware of the risk of
intellectual property theft by the Chinese, but the Chinese
market was just too big to cede to the competition"".
 Several months earlier, Eurocopter had signed a deal to make
EC 175 helicopters in China and at the time Airbus was
considering setting up a Chinese assembly plant, a move
finalized when Chirac visited Beijing in October that year.
 Earlier this year, EADS denied a newspaper report that
CEO Louis Gallois had described industrial espionage as a
""reality"" in China. This followed French suggestions that
Beijing may have had a hand in alleged spying at Renault. China
denied the spying claims and Renault last week itself
cast doubt on the accusations.
 U.S. diplomats in Germany and Moscow also chronicled a
""hamfisted attempt"" by Russia to gain a seat on the EADS board
with a purchase of 5 percent of the company's stock in 2006.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EADS management warned
then President Vladimir Putin against using the stake to disrupt
EADS, even though the ex-state bank which bought the stock told
the U.S. it had not done so for political gain, cables said.
 France and Germany are currently exploring ways, including a
golden share, to ensure the door is not opened to potential
predators or foreign powers if the ownership structure changes.
 There is no explicit suggestion in cables seen by Reuters
that EADS officials shared commercial secrets, and a senior
executive told Reuters certain people had been authorized to
hold contacts to lobby and improve U.S. understanding of EADS.
 Some EADS sources have also cast doubt on whether the U.S.
diplomatic contacts in Germany were as senior as cables suggest.
 But the tone of many of the comments, and the range of
subjects discussed, including the poor record of French and
German governments in running industry or a misplaced French
sense of superiority in aerospace, may prove embarrassing.
 On only one subject -- the question of whether Airbus would
seek European aid for its future A350 aircraft -- was a regular
Munich contact said to be ""uncharacteristically standoffish"".
 The question of A350 aid remains one of the most fiercely
contested issues in a row between the United States and European

 By Fayen Wong	
 SHANGHAI, March 8 (Reuters) - China's imports of
commodities, most of which posted strong increases in January,
may finally show signs of easing in February as an extended
holiday season disrupted shipments and high prices cut orders.	
 Market participants are cautious on the mid-term outlook for
imports, particularly iron ore and copper, as Beijing's credit
tightening has already made it difficult for firms to secure
loans to fund purchases. Monetary tightening measures are also
seen to create headwinds for overall commodities demand.	
 Arrivals of refined copper, the most popular form of the
metal in international and Chinese markets, are expected to have
fallen in February from the previous month as fabricating plants
halted operations for the Lunar New Year holiday, trade sources
said.	
 Some Chinese merchants have also asked to delay term
shipments that were set to arrive in late January and February,
adding to expectations of lower imports.	
 Judy Zhu, an analyst at Standard Chartered, reckons China's
refined copper imports will fall by around 15 percent from
January to 210,000 tonnes last month, as high prices raised
domestic output, while risk-averse buyers kept orders low and
bought on a hand-to-mouth basis.	
 ""We expect China's downstream demand for copper to improve
only gradually in the coming weeks, with a more decisive
recovery likely to be delayed until late March, as consumers are
reluctant to pay high prices,"" Zhu said in a March 7 research
note.	
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange
struck a record-high of $10,190 a tonne in mid-February, but
prices have since eased more than 7 percent on worries over the
Libyan crisis and tightening measures in China, which accounts
for 40 percent of the world's copper demand.	
 February's imports of iron ore are likely to drop from
January's 16-month high of 69 million tonnes, traders said, but
large bookings made in earlier months will still support imports
in February and March at more than 60 million tonnes.	
 ""The volume of ships chartered was still high in February,
around 30-40 percent more than usual, so we think iron ore
imports will only fall sharply in April,"" said a trader.	
 Chinese buyers begun scaling back on large purchases in late
December. But iron ore's record-high prices of nearly $200 a
tonne struck in mid-February have since led them to shun the
market.	
 Tepid demand has since prompted Platts 62 percent iron ore
benchmark  to shed 8.3 percent in the last 13
sessions to $177 a tonne and led market participants to predict
a sharp fall in imports in April. 
 China's General Administration of Customs will publish
preliminary data for February, including imports of oil, copper,
aluminium, soy and iron ore, on March 10. More detailed figures
will be issued later in the month.	
 Chinese imports have been strong since faltering in October,
which like February was a holiday month preceded by a month of
an unexpected surge in buying of major commodities.

 SLOWER DEMAND AHEAD	
 The country's imports of commodities have defied
expectations of a slowdown and rose strongly in January, as
buyers rushed to get shipments in ahead of the week-long Lunar
New Year holiday.	
 But in a sign that Chinese commodity imports may likely fall
in the months ahead, Chinese manufacturing declined for the
third consecutive month and grew at its slowest pace in at least
half a year in February, as the government's sustained campaign
to tame inflation weighed on industrial activity.

 Some market watchers expect China's crude imports to fall in
February from the preceding month on the back of an extended
holiday period and as at least two main refineries partially
shut for major maintenance in March and April.	
 Crude imports from the world's No.2 crude importer surged 27
percent from a year ago to 21.8 million tonnes in January, while
shipments in the two preceding months hovered at similarly high
levels of 20.9 million tonnes.	
 Volumes of another major import, soy, are expected to
plummet to a year-low of 3.13 million tonnes in February from
5.14 million tonnes in January, China's Commerce Ministry said.
Imports are set to remain around 3 million tonnes until April as
crushers avoid pricey imports in favour of state supplies.

 * Equities rise 
 * Euro zone peripheral bonds in focus
 * Wall Street set to open higher
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Oil fell from recent highs on
Tuesday on reports that OPEC may boost production, prompting
some recovery on equity markets.
 Wall Street looked set to open slightly higher after heavy
losses on Monday.
 Emerging market stocks were up 0.3 percent and Japan's
Nikkei closed up 0.2 percent. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 put in
gains of around 0.5 percent before slipping back to trade flat
by 1210 GMT.
 Kuwait's oil minister said OPEC was in talks to boost
production for the first time in more than two years.
 Such a move would mean the producer group's was effectively
putting a cap on prices to help keep the global economic
recovery on track.
 Brent oil was down around 50 cents at a little more than
$114 a barrel, after earlier dropping more than $2.
 Revolts in Tunisia and Egypt, fighting in Libya, and
protests from Morocco to Oman had driven Brent to almost $120 a
barrel.
 This in turn has rattled global investors who fear a burst
of inflation, along with potential interest rate hikes, could
deal a blow to global economic recovery.
 ""If oil stays in a $100-$120 per barrel range for around half
a year the global economy could see a severe slowdown, pushing
investors away from stocks, so everything depends on the Middle
East now"", said Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa
SB Investments.
 Despite the concerns, however, equities have remained
resilient during the period.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index is still up 3.6 percent
for the year to date and within reasonable range of new 30-month
highs.
 
 EURO PAUSES
 The euro slipped against the dollar, pausing from a rally
prompted by expectations that euro zone interest rates will be
raised as early as next month.
 The Swiss franc, which has strengthened as a safe haven
recently, slid after the statement from Kuwait's oil minister.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies, including the euro and Swiss franc.
 Some analysts say that with an ECB rate rise in April
largely priced in and indications that currency speculators have
ramped up their long euro positions, the euro is ripe for a
short-term correction.
 Yields rose on debt issued by the euro zone's lower-rated
sovereigns on Tuesday as the launch of a new Spanish bond by
syndication added to supply pressure in peripheral markets ahead
of a Portuguese bond auction keenly watched on Wednesday.
 ""The periphery had a good wobble yesterday so we may see
more of the same ... Portugal can't be far off asking for help,""
a trader said.

 * But keen on some Japan firms with exposure to Asia
 * Also wants to include India in dividend-linked fund
 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, March 8 (Reuters) - U.S. company Matthews will stay
underweight on Japanese stocks in its Asian dividend fund, though
it is upbeat on the outlook for shares from the country with
exposure to developing markets in Asia, a portfolio manager at
the firm said.
 Despite a climb in Japan's stock markets in the last few
months, Matthews International Capital Management wants to keep
its weighting for the country at around 20-25 percent, sharply
below the 40 percent in the index it uses as a benchmark, said
Jesper Madsen, portfolio manager of the firm's Matthews Asia
Dividend Fund.
 Madsen said the $2.2 billion fund has greater exposure to
Japan than those run by most other foreign fund management
companies, however, and that there are many attractive Japanese
stocks.
 ""I'm surprised more people are not more positive on the
country. There are many great companies here,"" Madsen told
Reuters in an interview.
 ""I'm not invested in the macroeconomics of Japan. Obviously
they will have an impact to a certain extent, but you can always
find companies that are good at what they do in Japan, niche and
growing with the rest of Asia.""
 Matthews Asia Dividend Fund was about 23.2 percent allocated
to Japanese equities as of December -- the second highest in its
portfolio, just behind China and Hong Kong at 23.3 percent.
 That's still well below the Japan weighting in its benchmark,
the MSCI All Country Asia-Pacific Index, however, which stands at
39.5 percent.
 Japanese companies that Matthews is keen on include Fanuc
Ltd, a leading maker of industrial robots, which Madsen said is
well positioned as demand for automation will be strong in
emerging markets, making China one of its key customers.
 Baby care product firm, Pigeon Corp, has a strong market
presence domestically and premium brand perception in China, he
added.
 As of December, the fund's major holdings in Japan included
trading company Itochu Corp and leasing firm Orix Corp.
 Madsen declined to comment on details on what he has been
investing in since the start of the year or on Japanese companies
outside his portfolio.
 INDIA SHIFT
 Matthews wants to add Indian shares to the fund in a bid to
diversify and to gain from long-term growth there.
 But Madsen is hesitant as companies in the country tend to
retain most of their earnings, instead of paying out much in
dividends.
 ""One country right now that we don't have any investments in
but that I would love to shift into would be India."".
 India is part of the MSCI All Country Asia-Pacific Index,
with an allocation of 5.0 percent.
 Matthews Asia Dividend Fund sharply outperformed the
benchmark, raising a positive return of 13.73 percent as of the
end of December from its inception in October 2006, compared to a
3.45 percent improvement in the benchmark.
 The fund was also ranked as No.1 among 31 funds in the same
category as of December, according to research company Lipper.

 By Sugita Katyal	
 SINGAPORE, March 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than $1
a barrel on Tuesday, pulling away from two-and-a-half year
highs, but Asian stocks remained under pressure as investors
worried higher energy prices could stunt the global economic
recovery.	
 U.S. crude oil futures fell $1.30 to $104.14 and
Brent crude dropped to $113.60 after reports that Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi was looking for a way to step down and as
Kuwait's oil minister said OPEC was in talks to increase
production to ease worries about Middle East supply disruptions.	
 European shares were expected to edge up, rebounding from
losses the previous day, as crude prices retreated. U.S. stock
index futures rose 0.6 percent, pointing to a firmer
opening on Wall Street. . 
 ""The market's fundamentals are recovering on corporate
earnings so sentiment for the longer term is good. But for the
short-term, the market may see some correction due to continuing
worries about developments in the Middle East,"" said Hajime
Nakajima, deputy general manager at Cosmo Securities.	
 Market players have been focused on the prospect of a
European Central Bank interest rate rise as early as next month,
but the euro zone debt crisis returned to the fore on Monday,
when Moody's slashed Greece's sovereign rating by three notches.	
 The euro edged higher on Tuesday but crowded bets on the
currency could cause a near-term decline before it is able to
take another shot at its November peak just above $1.4280.
.	
Japan's Nikkei benchmark edged higher as investors covered
short positions after selling heavily on Monday, but analysts
said gains may be limited as concerns about turmoil in the
Middle East and high oil prices persist.	
 Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.19 percent while the
broader Topix shed 0.26 percent.	
 After an early fall, MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares
outside Japan was up 0.5 percent helped by gains
in energy and industrial stocks.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.3 percent, helped
by a broadly stronger energy sector and gains in Chinese large
caps.	
 Seoul shares were up 0.81 percent after sharp falls
in the previous session, lifted by shipbuilders and financials
but falls in technology plays dented upside momentum. 
 ""It will be difficult for risk markets such as equities and
industrial commodities to push into higher ranges whilst the
threat to oil supplies remains elevated,"" said Ric Spooner,
chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Australia.	
 U.S. stocks fell on Monday, with the S&P 500 down 0.8
percent and the Nasdaq off 1.4 percent.	
 The prospects of further unrest in oil-rich Middle Eastern
countries has driven investors to seek safe-haven assets. 
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,430.55 an ounce by
0504 GMT, having rallied as high as $1,444.40 an ounce on
Monday, a record high, as violence flared in Libya and after the
downgrade of Greece's credit rating reignited worries about euro
zone sovereign debt.

 By Grant McCool	
 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The criminal trial of Galleon
hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam begins on Tuesday with jury
selection in a case at the heart of the biggest insider trading
investigation in a generation.	
 Sri Lankan born Rajaratnam, 53, is the former head of the
Galleon Group hedge fund that once managed $7 billion. He could
face a 20-year jail sentence if convicted on the most serious
charge of securities fraud.	
 Since arresting Rajaratnam in October 2009 and announcing
charges against 26 former traders, executives and lawyers, the
U.S. government has pressed ahead with what it calls the biggest
probe of insider trading in the $1.9 trillion hedge fund
industry.	
 Prosecutors allege Rajaratnam made $45 million in illicit
profits through tips from former friends and associates.
Nineteen people have pleaded guilty in the case, which stands
apart from past insider trading probes because of the
government's wide-scale use of phone taps.	
 The selection of a 12-member jury in Manhattan federal court
is the first opportunity for prosecutors and defense lawyers to
score points at trial after 16 months of jousting over wiretaps
and other evidence. Opening statements will start once the panel
is in place for a trial expected to last up to two months.	
 Rajaratnam is free on bail but fighting to stay out of
prison in a saga involving leaked company secrets, phone taps
and former friends, who will testify against him for the
government.	
 
 It is not known whether Rajaratnam will testify in his own
defense after the jury has heard hours of tapes and testimony
from as many as six cooperating witnesses. Prosecutors say they
could present up to 173 recordings of telephone conversations.	
 Among those who could be called by the government to testify
is Lloyd Blankfein, chief of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
 Prosecutors and regulators have accused former Goldman board
member Rajat Gupta of leaking information about the bank to his
friend Rajaratnam, but Gupta has not been criminally charged.

 Rajaratnam's chief defense lawyer, John Dowd, has fought
hard for his wealthy client, arguing prosecutors have broadened
the definition of insider trading. A money manager's liberty
should not be at risk because he trades on a stock while knowing
something about the company, Dowd argues.	
 He also fought, unsuccessfully, to suppress the FBI's
secretly recorded phone conversations from trial.	
 ""In some ways it sounds like a classic insider trading
case,"" said Sam Buell, law professor at Duke University in
Durham, North Carolina, who is not involved in the case. ""But we
can expect some kind of twist here in the nature of defense
arguments about this is a different realm of trading and
information sharing.""	
 For the jury to convict Rajaratnam, the government must
convince all 12 panel members that its evidence shows Rajaratnam
knew he was receiving secret corporate information from someone
who had a fiduciary duty not to disclose it.	
 The case is USA v Raj Rajaratnam et al, U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.

 * Dollar off 4-mth lows, short squeeze eyed
 * Yen takes Japan-related M&A news in stride

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, March 8 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Tuesday
but crowded bets on the currency could cause a near-term decline
before it is able to take another shot at its November peak just
above $1.4280.	
 One gauge of market positioning shows that currency
speculators have ramped up their long positions in the euro to a
three-year high, suggesting the single currency may come under
pressure if profit-taking sets in.	
 Analysts said the near-term outlook for the common currency,
which has gained some 4 percent against the dollar since
mid-February, also hinges on a summit of European Union leaders
on Friday as euro zone countries work on measures they hope will
resolve the region's debt crisis. 
 While investors have recently been more preoccupied with the
prospect of an interest rate hike by the European Central Bank
as early as next month, the debt crisis threatens to return to
the fore. 
 ""Our iFlow bond indicators confirm global fixed income
managers have once again become net sellers of especially Greek
and also Italian, Irish, Spanish and Portuguese exposure,"" said
BNY Mellon analyst Samarjit Shankar.	
 The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3981 , having
retreated from a four-month high around $1.4036 on Monday. 
 Moody's on Monday slashed Greece's sovereign debt ratings by
three notches and left the door open for more downgrades,
worried that the country's efforts to cut debt will not be
enough. This has added pressure on the EU to thrash out a
comprehensive package to deal with the euro zone debt crisis	
 The euro could consolidate for some time below Monday's high
before making another move higher. In the medium-term, the euro
has support in the $1.3840 to $1.3860 area, where a few intraday
highs hit in late February are clustered as well as the euro's
early February peak of $1.3862.	
 While a clear breach of that support area would point to the
possibility of the euro heading back down towards $1.3700, a
consolidation above that level could pave the way for the euro
to test its early November peak of $1.4283.	
 Unrest in the Middle East and higher oil prices also bear
watching, said a trader for a major Japanese bank in Singapore.	
 ""If the situation in the Middle East does not settle down
and prices of commodities stay high, and at the same differences
in monetary policies become even more stark, then the euro will
probably head higher against the dollar,"" said the trader for a
major Japanese bank.	
 A surge in crude oil prices in the past couple of weeks on
concerns that the supply of oil could be disrupted by turmoil in
the Middle East and North Africa have fanned worries about the
impact on U.S. consumer spending and helped weigh on the dollar.	
 
 SHORT DOLLAR POSITIONS	
 The dollar index dipped 0.1 percent to 76.458 , having
gotten a bit of reprieve after hitting a four-month low of
76.124 on Monday.	
 One factor that may support the dollar and weigh on the euro
in the near-term is market positioning.	
 ""We are still USD bears, but the scale of the speculative
market net shorts in the USD is significant,"" said Peter Frank,
strategist at Societe Generale.	
 Latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission shows that currency speculators boosted their bets in
favour of the euro to the highest since January 2008 in the week
to March 1, while bets against the dollar jumped across the
board. 
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 82.28 yen
, roughly in the middle of the prevailing range seen over
the past week of roughly between 81.60 yen and 83.00 yen.	
 The yen took in its stride news this week about cross-border
corporate investment involving Japanese firms.	
 Western Digital Corp , the world's No. 2 hard drive
maker, has agreed to buy Hitachi Ltd's hard disk drive
operations for about $4.3 billion in cash and stock.

 In the other direction, Terumo Corp has said it
would buy U.S. medical device company CaridianBCT from a Swedish
firm for about $2.6 billion, marking the largest acquisition by
a Japanese medical equipment maker. 
 The trader for a major Japanese bank in Singapore said it is
hard to tell just how much foreign exchange flows, if any, will
be generated by such cross-border investment.	
 In the case of Japanese firms investing abroad, they could
theoretically use foreign currency deposits accumulated through
their overseas earnings for such investment, the trader said.	
 Or they could borrow foreign currency denominated loans,
which would be another option that would not involve foreign
exchange, the trader added.

(Adds extra comment and details throughout)
 By Caren Bohan and Michael Martina	
 WASHINGTON/BEIJING, March 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President
Barack Obama will nominate Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, who
this year criticised China for not opening its markets, as next
U.S. ambassador to Beijing, two administration officials said.	
 Locke would be the first Chinese American to serve as
Washington's envoy to China and he would be the Obama
administration's second appointment of a high-profile politician
to the increasingly important and tricky post.	
 Locke will replace Jon Huntsman, who has set himself
publicly against the ruling Chinese Communist Party's efforts to
stamp out dissent three times in three weeks.	
 He steps down on April 30 and is considering a run for
president in which he'd join a field of Republicans vying to
challenge Obama in the 2012 election.	
 An official announcement on Locke could come as early as
Tuesday.	

Huntsman's path to White House starts in China
ANALYSIS on China's high-tech drive
 
 Locke, whose appointment must be confirmed by the U.S.
Senate, has served as Commerce Secretary and was previously
governor of Washington State, which has close economic ties with
China thanks to big corporate residents such as Boeing and
Microsoft.	
 ""He has served as a state governor, he is a seasoned
politician, he is familiar with the players here in China,"" said
Sun Zhe, the director of the Center for U.S.-China Relations at
Tsinghua University in Beijing.	
 ""So an American ambassador's duties toward human rights and
Taiwan won't be a difficult transition for him to make.""	
 
 BUSINESS ADVOCATE	
 Locke's grandfather emigrated from China to Washington
State, and his father, who was also born in China, ran a grocery
store in the United States. Locke made many trip to China as
governor of Washington and has remained active on that front as
Commerce secretary.	
 In his current job, Locke has at times taken up the cudgel
on behalf of U.S. businesses. In February he criticized China
for not honoring promises to open its market.	
 ""This type of behaviour simply has to change,"" he said in a
speech in New York.	
 Locke said U.S. companies have a variety of concerns about
China's trade practices but ""the fundamental problem often boils
down to the distance between the promises of China's government
and its actions"".	
 As ambassador, Locke would be in charge of day-to-day
management of a vast and complicated relationship that extends
well beyond often strained commercial ties.	
 The world's two biggest economies have sought to steady
relations after tensions throughout 2010 over human rights,
Taiwan, Tibet and the value of the yuan.	
 While none of the disputes that dogged ties last year has
gone away, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the White House
in January, a summit that both sides called a success in
nurturing more mutual trust.	
 Last year, Locke led a group of nearly two dozen corporate
executives on a mission to explore opportunities in China's
fast-growing clean energy sector. He has warned that the United
States risks being left behind as China plows billions of
dollars into solar, wind and other ""green"" technologies.	
 ""If he is actually nominated by the president, I think it is
an extremely good choice,"" said Christian Murck, president of
the American Chamber of Commerce in China. ""He has lots of
experience here as Commerce Secretary, as a governor and as a
lawyer in his private practice. 
 ""That a cabinet secretary would leave his position indicates
the importance of the relationship and shows what Huntsman
brought to the role ,"" Murck said.	
 Huntsman, a former Republican governor of Utah, raised
eyebrows in the White House when he sent signals several weeks
ago he was considering entering the 2012 presidential race.	
 Huntsman has sparred with Chinese officials in recent weeks
over human rights issues, including his condemnation of the
harassment of foreign reporters seeking to cover protests.	
 He is expected to make a decision on whether he will run for
president when he returns from China at the end of April.

 * Capital controls useful in cases ""few and far between""
 * No change to growth forecast despite lofty oil price
(Adds links to Reuters Insider TV)	
 By Lesley Wroughton and Chrystia Freeland	
 WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - Emerging market economies
that powered the global recovery may be growing too fast for
their own good as inflation pressures build, a top International
Monetary Fund official said on Monday.	
 China, Brazil and other fast-growing nations have struggled
to contain inflation and control heavy inflows of investment
money. Although the IMF has been warning for months of the risks
of price pressure, the comments by the Fund's first deputy
managing director, John Lipsky, suggested the IMF is growing
increasingly concerned.	
 ""For the emerging economies, growing at 6.5 to 7 percent,
their margins of excess capacity have been largely used up, and
as a result we're starting to see incipient signs of
overheating,"" Lipsky told Reuters Insider in an interview.	
 After the global economic slump of 2008 and 2009, the
recovery took divergent paths, with emerging markets powering
ahead while advanced economies merely trudged along. 
 With growth and interest rates remaining unusually low
across the developed world, investors have flocked to emerging
markets, bringing much-needed capital but also a risk of
inflation.	
 Rising oil prices have compounded the inflation problem, but
Lipsky said the IMF has not cut its growth forecast because it
thinks the oil price spike will prove temporary.	
 
 He said until unrest spread to oil-producing Libya, much of
the rise in oil prices in late 2010 and early 2011 reflected an
improved economic outlook. However, the latest worries about
supply disruptions created a ""fear factor"" that drove oil above
$100 a barrel, which if sustained would pose a bigger threat to
growth.	
 Rising food prices are also worrisome, particularly for
poorer countries where food consumes a larger percentage of
household budgets, he said. The cost of food was one of many
reasons behind the recent upheaval in Egypt and Tunisia.	
 ""We have to be concerned even in places where there is no
political upheaval,"" Lipsky said. ""The social strains and real
difficulties for poor residents in many economies is something
that has to be attended to.""	
 
 WHAT TO DO?	
 For emerging markets, cooling growth without inflicting too
much damage on the global economy will require some delicate
maneuvering.	
 China has made curbing inflation its top policy priority
this year. Its finance minister said earlier on Monday China
will ensure that spending on social priorities does not fan
inflationary fires. (For more, see )	
 Separately, Zhu Min, special adviser to the IMF's managing
director, said China's loan growth was too strong and addressing
that was key to safely slowing down the economy.	
 ""It's a fundamental challenge,"" he said during a
presentation to an economists' group meeting in Arlington,
Virginia. ""So that's a concern, overheating. In China, slowing
down economic growth is important.""	
 Brazil and some other emerging markets have increased taxes
on foreign investors or raised banks' reserve requirements to
try to slow inflows of investment money and ward off
inflationary pressures.	
 Lipsky, however, offered only a lukewarm endorsement of such
moves, known as capital controls. He said the measures may be
necessary and useful at times, but those cases were ""few and far
between"" and other methods such as adjusting exchange rates and
monetary or fiscal policies ought to take precedence.	
 The IMF is in the midst of its own internal debate over when
and how capital controls ought to be used. IMF staff released a
paper in January that said the Fund had been ""hamstrung"" in its
efforts to come up with rules to guide countries on implementing
controls because its own membership disagreed on what those
rules should be.	
 ""Rather than leaving each individual country to decide how
it's going to react, it's better to start talking about some
potential guidelines or rules of the road, rules of the game,
about how best to proceed so that one country, seemingly acting
in its own self interest isn't creating problems for the broader
global economy or its neighbors,"" Lipsky said.

that higher energy prices would stunt the global economic

(Adds details)
 TORONTO, March 7 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar 
finished lower against the greenback on Monday, buffeted by
volatile oil prices, which fluctuated with violence in Libya
and on concerns about supply disruptions.
 U.S. crude futures , an influential factor for the
commodity-linked Canadian dollar, ended higher, though paring
some gains after reaching their highest level since September
2008. But Brent crude oil futures ended lower. [ID:nL3E7E700D]
 The Canadian dollar managed to limit losses, finishing at
C$0.9729 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0279, down from Friday's
North American session close at C$0.9717 to the U.S. dollar, or
$1.0291.
 The currency stayed in a moderate range of C$0.97-C$0.9743,
similar to the last seven sessions, which have seen the
currency locked in a C$0.97-C$0.98 band.
 ""We've had a shift in markets over the day. It started off
very positive and everything's turned negative as the day wore
through. We've had a pretty tight range over the last few
sessions here,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist
at Scotia Capital.
 ""(Dollar/Canada) hasn't really been able to move lower, but
it's not really moving substantially above. It just highlights
that it's waiting for a catalyst, and that's likely to be oil.""
 Oil was the leading factor that pressured equity markets,
as worries mounted about the stifling effect of higher oil
prices, which are now above $100 a barrel. Major North American
indexes were down more than 1 percent at one point on Monday.
 Sutton noted the correlation between U.S. oil prices and
the Canadian dollar has strengthened once again, particularly
on a rolling 30-day basis, with factors such as the euro,
interest rate spreads, and equities lagging oil.
 Canadian government bonds were mildly mixed with equities
on the decline and tracked U.S. Treasuries, which fell on
upcoming $66 billion in new supply this week.
 The two-year bond  was unchanged to yield of
1.853 percent, while the five year bond eked out a 1 Canadian
cent gain to yield 2.763 percent. The 10-year bond 
edged down 10 Canadian cents to yield 3.350 percent.
 HOUSING, JOBS DATA AHEAD
 Several pieces of data this week will help determine the
strength of the domestic economic recovery and market pricing
on the Bank of Canada's next interest rate hike.
 ""We're waiting for some sort of catalyst to kick us out of
this current range that we're in (where) C$0.97 is looking to
be pretty good (U.S. dollar) support. It's going to be
data-driven."" said Brendan McGrath, senior foreign exchange
trader at Western Union Business Solutions, in Victoria,
British Columbia.
 Housing starts, due on Tuesday, could show whether the
sector continues to be a drag on overall growth after being a
main factor pulling the economy from recession.
 Trade data for January on Thursday, as well as the February
reading on the jobs market on Friday, will be the main
attractions this week as market players look to see whether
both pieces of data can repeat the unexpected strength from
their previous months.
 But if any of the data is weaker, the Canadian dollar may
follow suit and weigh on anticipation of an interest rate hike
before midyear, analysts said.
 The central bank has stayed on the sidelines since
September after three consecutive rate increases last year
brought its benchmark rate to a still-low 1 percent.
 Overnight index swaps, which trade based on expectations
for the key central bank rate, imply a fully priced-in rate
increase on the bank's Sept. 7 decision date.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - The euro stumbled on Monday
after its recent rally against the dollar as sovereign debt
worries returned, but expectations for higher euro zone
interest rates should continue to favor the currency.
 The euro early in the day rose to a four-month high against
the dollar above $1.40, but the gains faded as trading in
London wound down and liquidity began to dry up in New York.
The euro  was last at $1.3975, down 0.1 percent on the
day, according to Reuters data.
 The euro remains up about 4.5 percent against the greenback
year-to-date, largely on expectations the European Central Bank
will raise rates well before the U.S. Federal Reserve does so.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet surprised
investors on Thursday by saying euro zone interest rates may
rise as early as next month.
 ""It's been a long time since a major power raised interest
rates, so just the thought that the ECB may raise interest
rates is a big deal,"" said Chuck Butler, president of EverBank
World Markets in St. Louis. He warned, however, that a possible
rate rise ""should not overshadow that the euro zone debt
problems could be back if there is no resolution.
 ""If they do not do something by the end of March, the euro
could pull back,"" Butler said.
 The latest data showed speculators' long euro positions at
their highest level since January 2008 [IMM/FX]. The data shows
positions taken only until last Tuesday, two days before before
Trichet spoke on Thursday.
 ""All are long against USD, but none scream 'overdone,'""
said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto.
 Instead it looks like the market is just bearish on the
dollar, he said.
 ""The next IMM report does not seem set to say anything
different,"" he said.
 Greg Anderson, G10 strategist at CitiFX in New York, said
the IMM data showed that the leveraged funds category is at an
eight-month high in terms of participation in the FX market.
 ""We view this as a sign that the FX market in general is
presently attracting more speculative activity than normal,
which might make it vulnerable to a reversal at some point,"" he
said. ""We suspect the broad trend of USD weakness is triggering
momentum model-driven funds to take positions.""
 Meanwhile, sovereign debt concerns, which have been largely
dormant in recent months, returned to the forefront as Moody's
slashed Greece's debt rating by three notches and kept Greek
debt on review for a further possible downgrade. For details,
see [ID:nLDE7260D6]
 Many economies in the 17-nation euro zone continue to
struggle with low growth and high debt burdens. A euro zone
leaders' meeting later this week may prove to be a test of the
euro's resilience.
 At the same time, the dollar's safe-haven appeal has been
diminished despite ongoing geopolitical turmoil, hurt by the
chance of an oil-driven jump in inflation and expectations that
U.S. interest rates will lag those in Europe.
 In an interview published on Monday, an ECB Executive
Board member, Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, said an April rate
increase was possible as the European Central Bank continues
its effort to control inflation. [ID:nLDE72503L]
 The ECB's stance contrasts sharply with that of the Federal
Reserve, which is expected to keep monetary policy loose for
some time. That reflects the Fed's greater concern with the
U.S. economic growth outlook than inflationary pressures.
 The dollar was nearly flat against the yen at 82.24 yen
. The euro was down 0.1 percent against the yen at 114.95
 and was up 0.1 percent at 1.2944 Swiss francs

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Monday
as fears that Libya's unrest could spread in the Middle East
drove prices of oil and gold higher, putting the global
economic recovery at risk.
 Oil jumped to a 2-1/2-year peak while gold hit a record
high. Both retreated later on talk that Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi was trying to negotiate an exit from Libya.
 Fears that higher oil prices could curb the economic
recovery drove down equities in both Europe and the United
States, with technology shares on Wall Street also hit by a
downgrade on the semiconductor industry by Wells Fargo.
 The euro was slightly weaker against the dollar as
expectations faded of a euro zone interest rate hike next month
and on resurging debt concerns triggered by a Moody's downgrade
of Greece.
 Brent crude oil futures  had jumped to $118.50 per
barrel, their highest level since September 2008, as Gaddafi's
counter-offensive against rebels deepened concerns that
Africa's largest holder of oil reserves is headed for civil
war.
 Prices of Brent were 0.15 percent lower in the afternoon,
at $115.82, as investors also took the opportunity to pocket
some profits. U.S. crude futures , however, remained up
0.6 percent at $105.27 a barrel, after reaching an intraday
high of $106.95.
 ""The major risk remains the prospect of the political
unrest spreading to the Gulf-producing region,"" said Caroline
Bain, economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""However,
even if there is civil unrest in Saudi Arabia, it is not a
given that oil production will be affected.""
 The prospects of further unrest in oil-rich Middle Eastern
countries drove investors to seek safe-haven assets. Gold spot
prices  hit a record high of $1,444.40 an ounce while
silver  rose as high as $36.52 an ounce, its highest
since early 1980.

 NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped to a
2-1/2-year peak and gold hit an all-time high on Monday as
investors worried that widening unrest in Libya could spread to
other oil-producing nations in the Middle East.
 Oil prices edged off early peaks on talk that Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi was trying to negotiate an exit from Libya an
on profit-taking. But Brent crude prices remained higher, at
around $116 per barrel, and U.S. crude prices were up more than
1 percent around $105 a barrel.
 Fears that higher oil prices could curb the economic
recovery drove down equities in both Europe and the United

that Africa's largest holder of oil reserves is headed for
civil war.
 Prices of Brent were still 0.36 percent higher at $116.41,
with rumors that the Libyan leader was trying to secure a safe
exit from the country merely curbing initial gains.
 ""The major risk remains the prospect of the political
unrest spreading to the Gulf-producing region,"" said Caroline

 NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell from the day's
high and traded little changed against the dollar on Monday as
expectations of a euro zone interest rate hike next month
faded.
 The euro had gained for four straight days, but the gains
faded as trading in London wound down and liquidity began to

raised interest rates, so just the thought that the ECB may
raise interest rates is a big deal,"" said Chuck Butler,

should not overshadow that the euro zone debt problems could be
back if there is no resolution.
 ""If they do not do something by the end of March, the euro
could pull back,"" Butler said.
 The common currency had been strong since European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet surprised investors on
Thursday by saying that Eurozone interest rates may rise as
early as next month.
 The euro  was last little changed at $1.3992,
falling from an earlier four-month high of $1.4036 on

 Gains initially accelerated on Monday as stop-loss orders
were triggered on the break of $1.4005 and $1.4025, though the
rally stalled ahead of an options barrier at $1.4050. More
option barriers are said to be placed at $1.41

 The ECB's stance contrasts sharply with that of the U.S.

 NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices jumped to a
2-1/2-year peak and gold hit an all-time high on Monday as
investors worried that widening unrest in Libya could spread to
other oil-producing nations in the Middle East.
 Rumors that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was seeking a
deal with rebels caused oil to erase some gains. But U.S. crude
prices remained more than 1 percent higher, trading around $105
a barrel.
 The increase in the price of oil weighed on both European
and U.S. stocks, with technology shares on Wall Street also hit
by a downgrade on the semiconductor industry by Wells Fargo.
 The euro fell against the dollar after having earlier hit a
four-month high as expectations of a euro zone interest rate
hike next month faded.
 U.S. crude oil futures  jumped to as high as $106.95
per barrel, the highest level since September 2008, as
Gaddafi's counter-offensive against rebels deepened concerns
that Africa's largest holder of oil reserves is headed for
civil war. Prices were still 1.08 percent higher at $105.55
after rumors that the Libyan leader was trying to secure a safe
exit from the country merely curbed initial gains.
 ""The major risk remains the prospect of the political
unrest spreading to the Gulf-producing region,"" said Caroline
Bain, economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""However,
even if there is civil unrest in Saudi Arabia, it is not a
given that oil production will be affected.""
 The prospects of further unrest in oil-rich Middle Eastern
countries drove investors to seek safe-haven assets. Gold spot
prices  hit a record high of $1,444.40 an ounce while
silver  rose as high as $36.52 an ounce, its highest
since early 1980.
 ""If we do see tension escalating further, then we could
witness a new high in gold,"" said Ong Yi Ling, investment
analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.

propose to cull surplus emissions permits from the European
Union's carbon market from 2013-2020, a senior EU source said on
Monday, under a long-term plan for curbing greenhouse gases.
 The Commission is due to publish its ""Climate Roadmap to

 The EU emissions trading scheme caps carbon emissions from
factories and power plants by issuing a fixed quota of permits,
which are now in surplus after a financial crisis cut industrial
pollution, causing carbon prices to fall.
 The fate of a plan to remove several hundred million tonnes
of permits from 2013-2020 had appeared uncertain earlier on
Monday after squabbling between the energy and climate
departments of the Commission, according to EU sources, but the
climate department view had prevailed, an informed source said.
 ""The set aside has been re-inserted and the levels being
considered are the same as previously,"" he said, referring to
plans to remove 500 million-800 million EUAs from 2013-2020.
 That compares with an annual allocation to industry of about
2 billion EUAs, each equivalent to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide
emissions.

 * Biggest challenge is dwindling foreign reserves: analyst
 KHARTOUM, March 7 (Reuters) - Sudan on Monday named former
state finance minister Mohamed Kheir al-Zubeir as the new
governor of its central bank, a day after the resignation of his
predecessor Sabir Mohamed al-Hassan.
 The timing of Hassan's departure, just four months before
the secession of the country's oil-producing south and in the
midst of an economic crisis, dismayed many.
 But sources in the banking industry on Monday said they were
encouraged by the speed of the replacement and Zubeir's
experience.
 ""Dr Sabir is a loss. It is something that everyone agrees,""
said one senior banking official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
 ""Definitely Mohamed Kheir al-Zubeir's background -- as
chairman of a bank, minister of finance -- will give comfort to
the system,"" the official added.
 Sudan's state news agency Suna announced the appointment
with a text message alert: ""Mohamed Kheir al-Zubeir appointed
governor for Bank of Sudan.""
 Southerners overwhelmingly voted to declare independence in
a January referendum, promised in a 2005 peace deal that ended
decades of north-south civil war. The south is due to secede on
July 9.
 Uncertainty over how the two nations will disentangle
themselves, and fears of a return to conflict, have added to an
economic crisis that has created foreign exchange shortages, an
effective currency devaluation and rising inflation.
 ""The greatest challenge for the new governor will be the
foreign exchange situation after secession,"" said Abda al-Mahdi,
the head of economic consultancy UNICON, before Zubeir's name
had been released.
 Mahdi, herself a former state minister of finance, added the
governor would also have the tricky task of handling relations
with the south after the split.
 Up to 75 percent of Sudan's oil reserves, its main foreign
currency earner, lie in the south and will be lost to the north
after the split.
 The south has also decided to introduce its own currency
after separation and will need the north's cooperation to redeem
the old Sudanese pounds circulating in its system.
 Zubeir's job, which currently covers the whole country, will
only cover the north after the south's secession.
 Sudan's central bank on Sunday said Hassan, 65, was stepping
down because of his age and the arduous nature of the job.

 * Border runs along Russia-backed rebel territory
 * WTO member Georgia has veto power over new entrants
 
 By Margarita Antidze
 TBILISI, March 7 (Reuters) - Georgia and Russia will resume
talks this week over Moscow's bid to join the World Trade
Organisation with Tbilisi insisting on a deal over customs
controls on their internationally recognised border.
 The initiative to meet came from the Russian side, Georgian
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikoloz Vashakidze told reporters on
Monday.
 ""Russia officially initiated negotiations... The Georgian
side was always stating its readiness for negotiations,""
Vashakidze said, adding that talks will be held on March 9-10 in
the Swiss capital, Bern.
 He gave no details, while Russia's chief negotiator Maxim
Medvedkov declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
 Georgia ceased WTO talks with Russia in April 2008 after the
Kremlin ordered the lifting of economic sanctions against the
breakaway Georgian regions Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are
backed by Moscow.
 The two countries subsequently fought a brief war that year
in which Russian troops repelled an attempt by Georgia to
recapture South Ossetia by force.
 The European Union formally backed Russia's 17-year-long bid
for membership of the WTO last December, bringing it closer to
reality in 2011. But Georgia holds an effective veto.
 Georgia says it is insisting on ""transparency"" on its border
with Russia, parts of which lie outside Tbilisi's control in
Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
 ""Our main demand is the same -- transparency of trade
between member countries of the WTO,"" Georgian member of
parliament Akaky Minashvili told reporters.
 ""We want to monitor movements of cargoes on the Abkhaz and
South Ossetian sections of our border. Who will be fulfilling
this monitor is a subject of negotiations,"" he said.
 He did not rule out posting Georgian customs officials on
the border, a move Russia is unlikely to support.
 Only Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and the tiny Pacific
island of Nauru recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as
independent states with their own borders.
 The rest of the world says they are part of Georgia, but
Tbilisi lost its remaining footholds in the rebel territories in
2008 when Russia crushed a Georgian military assault on South
Ossetia, launched after fatal skirmishes with separatists.
 Georgia is already a member of the organisation, which
umpires global trade. Under WTO consensus rules, all 153 member
states have the right to veto Russia's accession bid.
 Some experts say that Russia's WTO bid will be one of the
issues during the U.S. vice-president Joe Biden's visit to
Russia this week.

(Adds further economist reaction, Broadbent quotes)
 By David Milliken
 LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Britain's government has picked
a Goldman Sachs economist who favours tighter monetary policy to
replace arch-hawk Andrew Sentance at the Bank of England, likely
preserving the existing balance on the BoE's policymaking board.
 Finance minister George Osborne named the U.S. investment
bank's UK economist Ben Broadbent on Monday to succeed Sentance
when he steps down from the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee at
the end of May. 
 The MPC is currently split 6-3 against raising rates, but
markets believe it is odds-on to raise rates in May from a
record low of 0.5 percent.
 Broadbent, a former BoE and Treasury economist who has
worked at Goldman Sachs since 2000, will serve a renewable
three-year term.
 His research at Goldman suggests he is upbeat about UK
growth for 2011, and in a research note published on Sunday he
said that recent private-sector activity surveys put the BoE ""on
the cusp of rate-hike territory"".
 Goldman Sachs has pencilled in three quarter-point rate
rises for this year and a further four for 2012, making their
forecasts slightly higher than the consensus in a Reuters poll.
 While economists' forecasts of the most likely path for
central bank rates do not always match their personal views of
appropriate policy, they appear to overlap in Broadbent's case.
 ""In short, it looks as if rates should rise sooner than (BoE
Governor) Mr King would like,"" he wrote in an opinion piece for
the Financial Times on Feb. 9.
 
 LIKELY HAWK
 Economists familiar with Broadbent's work said that he was
at the more hawkish end of the policy spectrum.
 ""While he's probably nowhere near as hawkish as Sentance,
he'll be on that end of the MPC,"" said Nomura economist Philip
Rush.
 Sentance voted for a 50 basis point increase in interest
rates last month, and was a lone voice calling for higher rates
throughout the second half of 2010.
 Rush said Broadbent had appeared surprised at the slow pace
of BoE rate tightening in the past, and expected him to vote for
an August rate rise, assuming the bank had already started to
tighten policy in May.
 Goldman Sachs's UK economists, led by Broadbent, were at the
extreme hawkish edge of the range of regular forecasters in
Reuters' Bank of England interest rate polls for much of 2010.
 In January 2010, Goldman predicted rates would rise to 1.5
percent by the end of the second quarter of last year, and 2.5
percent going into 2011 -- hugely out of step with the consensus
and, as it turned out, reality.
 Broadbent has described the large 0.6 percent contraction in
the British economy at the end of 2010 as a ""weather-related
blip"", arguing that official data overstates the depth of the
downturn. He has played down the likely impact of fiscal
tightening on UK growth, given the export opportunities offered
by a strong global economy.
 More recently, Broadbent has said that whether the BoE will
raise rates depends on first-quarter growth living up to the
expectations of a sharp rebound and private-sector wage deals
picking up further.
 A rate increase purely to bolster the BoE's credibility
would be premature, as bond markets are relatively stable, and
policymakers should not overstate their ability to tackle real
shocks facing the British economy, he added.
 Equally, the impact of higher interest rates on indebted
households would be relatively modest compared to the effect of
tax rises and energy costs, and this should not be an argument
against tightening rates, he said.
 
 HARD TO PREDICT
 Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays Capital, said that it
was notoriously difficult to predict how an economist would
behave once he was on the MPC. Sentance was expected to be a
policy dove -- supporting relatively lower interest rates --
given his background as a business economist.
 ""However, from what we know of Mr Broadbent, although he may
not be as hawkish as Mr Sentance he seems likely to be towards
that end of the MPC spectrum,"" he said.
 Broadbent studied at the University of Cambridge and Harvard
University, where he gained a PhD, and also worked as an
assistant professor at Columbia University.
 ""His broad professional experience in the financial sector
and academia, as well as his detailed knowledge of the UK
economy, will be extremely valuable to the Committee,"" Osborne
said in a statement.
 Britain's finance ministry said that 26 men and one woman
applied to replace Sentance after the position was advertised in
January. Applicants were interviewed by two senior Treasury
officials and former MPC member Kate Barker.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2011 09:36AM ET</span>",Reuters Summit-UPDATE 1-Stanbic bullish on Nigerian loan growth," * Sees 20-25 percent sector-wide loan growth
 * Sees rising demand for infrastructure, consumer finance
 * Deepening capital markets aid long-term risk pricing

(Adds details, quotes throughout)
 By Nick Tattersall and Chijioke Ohuocha
 LAGOS, March 7 (Reuters) - Nigeria's banking sector could
see 20-25 percent loan growth over the next three to five years
as demand for both consumer and infrastructure finance
increases, the chief executive of Stanbic IBTC said.
 Chris Newson, head of the Nigerian unit of South Africa's
Standard Bank, said growth would be driven by Nigeria's
significant infrastructure finance needs as well as the
emergence of small businesses and a growing middle class.
 ""If you think about what would be a reasonable level of
growth within risk assets across the industry, our sense is a
20-25 percent is not completely unrealistic,"" Newson said on
Monday in an interview as part of the Reuters Africa Investment
Summit.
 Africa's most populous nation has a huge infrastructure gap.
 The government has announced multi-billion dollar plans to
privatise the power sector in a bid to end chronic electricity
shortages, while new roads, bridges and homes are being built in
cities including the capital Abuja and commercial hub Lagos.
 ""There is an advisory opportunity but there is also an asset
opportunity. Where we have liquidity and capital, as we do,
we'll be looking to take on some of those assets on to our own
books,"" Newson said.
 A widening middle class in the nation of 150 million people,
combined with the potential for the growth in small business as
infrastructure improves, also present opportunities for personal
and small business banking.
 ""We think the engine room of growth coming out of Nigeria
will particularly be in that business banking, individual
environment,"" Newson said in his offices in Lagos.
 ""The question of consumer finance is very, very young in
Nigeria and the opportunity there we think over time is very
significant,"" he said.
 He said Stanbic IBTC had 151 branches in Nigeria, double the
number it had in 2007, and was still in an ""investment phase"".
 
 FIRST STEP IN BANKING REFORM
 Newson said the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria
(AMCON) -- a state-run ""bad bank"" set up to soak up
non-performing loans in the banking sector following a $4
billion bailout in 2009 -- was an important first step in
developing a strong and sustainable financial system in Nigeria.
 AMCON Chief Executive Mustapha Chike-Obi told Reuters last
week the company, which is also tasked with recapitalising the
rescued banks, was on track to soak up all bad credit in the
sector by the end of the month.
 ""AMCON and the recapitalisation is only one step in the
process. We need to realise that the heart and the core of the
problems in the sector were really around corporate governance
and risk management,"" he said.
 ""The questions over time will be are the lessons learned,
and the capacity of both the industry and the regulators to
manage those two key aspects.""
 He said he anticipated a further round of consolidation in
the banking sector once the system had been fully stabilised.
 One major challenge for businesses in sub-Saharan Africa's
second-biggest economy is a lack of long-term credit, something
Newson said was changing as the capital markets develop.
 Although Nigeria has 20-year bonds, the bulk of liquidity is
in the shorter-term 3- and 5-year papers, making long-term risk
pricing difficult, particularly with a lot of long-term
infrastructure financing denominated in dollars.
 Newson said Nigeria's debut Eurobond, launched in January,
was a step in the right direction, giving it a greater ability
to price and hedge dollar risk.
 He also said he believed Nigeria had a ""healthy level"" of
foreign reserves which were adequate for it to continue to
support the naira currency.
 Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi last month criticised
calls from the IMF for greater exchange rate flexibility, saying
he did not believe the naira was overvalued.

month helped it vault back above $1.40, with a ratings downgrade of Greece
having little lasting impact.
 Traders said the shared currency was on course to test last November's
highs in the $1.4080-1.4280 area, supported by steady buying from real money
accounts and as interest rate differentials remained in focus despite rising
oil prices and turmoil in Libya.
 The euro  was last up 0.2 percent to trade at $1.4013 after
earlier climbing to a four-month high of $1.4036, on electronic trading
platform EBS. Having breached resistance at its early February peak of $1.3862
during last week's rally, one possible upside euro target is now $1.4283, a
peak hit on EBS in early November.
 Gains accelerated on Monday as stop loss orders were triggered on the break
of $1.4005 and $1.4025, though the rally stalled ahead of an options barrier at
$1.4050. More option barriers are said to be placed at $1.41
 ""ECB President Trichet's comments exceeded the market's already hawkish
expectations and have provided fuel for the latest leg up in euro/dollar,"" said
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc. in
Washington. ""Even Friday's downgrade of Spain's sovereign debt by Fitch's
rating agency and an overnight downgrade of Greece by Moody's had little impact
on the single currency's broad strength.""
 The common currency has been strong since European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet surprised investors on Thursday by saying that interest
rates may rise as early as next month.
 Latest data showed speculators' long euro positions at their highest level
since January 2008 [IMM/FX]. The data only shows positions taken to Tuesday,
two days before before Trichet spoke on Thursday.
 Large long positions were also recorded in the Canadian dollar and
Australian dollar. While large one-sided positions can lead to volatility,
analysts are not expecting price trends to change without unexpected event
risk.
The euro's rise made the dollar index <.DXY> cede ground and fall to a
four-month low of 76.124.

 The ECB's stance contrasts sharply with that of the U.S. Federal Reserve,

concern about the outlook for growth than about inflationary pressures.

growth risks while the ECB will fight inflation risks,"" BNP Paribas analysts
wrote in a report. Expectations that the ECB also will be ahead of other
major central banks like the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank helped
the common currency on the crosses.

 * U.S. policymaker won't rule out extending stimulus
 * United inflation fight does not mean united policies
(Adds comments from IMF's Lipsky, details)
 By Sakari Suoninen and Natsuko Waki
 BASEL, Switzerland, March 7 (Reuters) - A spike in food and
oil prices has made the threat of inflation more acute, but
that does not mean authorities need to respond to the threat in
a similar manner, leading central banks said on Monday.
 A top European central banker said rising energy costs were
posing a threat to both emerging and advanced economies. But a
U.S. Federal Reserve official said more stimulus may be needed
to keep lofty oil prices from dragging down the U.S. economy.
 Jean-Claude Trichet, speaking as chair of talks on the
global economy at a Bank for International Settlements meeting,
said the latest rise in oil prices underlined inflation
concerns, though he said that so far, the global economy was
set for relatively robust growth.
 ""Additional tensions that have been observed in the price
of oil and energy are giving an additional importance to the
message we had in January to the global economy as a whole,""
Trichet said.
 ""We are all devoted to continue anchoring solidly inflation
expectations; that doesn't mean we take the same decisions.""
 A shock warning last week from Trichet, the head of the
European Central bank, that the ECB could raise euro zone
interest rates next month highlighted differences with the
looser stance of the Fed, driving the euro sharply higher.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a clear sign no imminent shift in U.S. policy is brewing, said last week that the rise
in crude oil prices should lead to only a modest, temporary
increase in U.S. inflation ""at most.""
 On Monday, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis
Lockhart went further, saying U.S. policymakers should not rule
out further bond purchases if things worsen.

 Lockhart pointed to the heightened economic uncertainty
stemming from the political upheaval in the Middle East and
North Africa. He stressed that he would be reluctant to extend
the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program past its scheduled
end date in June, but said he would not take it off the table.
 ""Given the emergence of new risks ... I prefer a posture of
flexibility as regards policy options,"" Lockhart said, voicing
an openness to a potentially easier policy that some hawks at
the Fed do not appear to share. [ID:nDYE7DH014]
 The No. 2 at the International Monetary Fund, John Lipsky,
told Reuters Insider that inflation expectations did not seem
to be on the rise in either Europe or the United States.
 He conceded, however, that if the ""fear factor"" pushing oil
prices up lasted for a lengthy period, it could undercut global
growth. So far, the IMF had not adjusted its estimate that the
global economy would grow 4.4 percent this year, Lipsky said.
 OIL WORRIES HIT STOCKS
 U.S. crude oil futures rose nearly 1 percent on Monday to
their highest levels since September 2008. Global food prices
have also been rising and hit a record high in February, driven
by rising grain costs and tighter supply.
 The run-up in oil prices undercut stocks. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> dropped about 80 points, while the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 11 points.
 Trichet said different policies did not mean some central
banks were abandoning their commitment to stable prices.
 ""There is unity of purpose and this is crystallizing in the
goal of solidly anchoring inflation expectations,"" he said.

 Jean-Claude Trichet, speaking as chair of talks at a Bank

circumstances.""

week that it could raise euro zone interest rates next month

the goal of solidly anchoring inflation expectations,"" Trichet
said after the BIS meeting.

on Monday as deepening unrest in Libya heightened worries about

 * Food prices seen rising over next decade
 * Declining stock to utilisation ratio a ""worry""-FAO offical
(Adds details from FAO official on lower stocks)
 By Svetlana Kovalyova and Deepa Babington
 MILAN/ROME, March 7 (Reuters) - Climate change bringing
floods and drought, growing biofuel demand and national policies
to protect domestic markets could drive up global food prices
and threaten long-term food security, the United Nations said.
 High and volatile food prices are a growing global concern,
partly fuelling the protests that toppled the rulers of Tunisia
and Egypt this year. The aftershocks have been seen across North
Africa and the Middle East from Algeria to Yemen.
 Periods of price volatility are not new to agriculture, but
recent price shocks triggered by extreme weather and increasing
use of grains to produce energy have caused great concern, the
U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation said.
 ""There are fears that price volatility may be increasing,""
the FAO said in its State of Food and Agriculture report.
 The growing influence of commodities markets and
""counter-productive 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policy responses (to
high prices)...may exacerbate international market volatility
and jeopardise global food security,"" it said.
 The Rome-based FAO has already warned food-producing
countries against introducing export curbs to protect local
markets as world food prices push further above the levels that
triggered deadly riots in 2007/2008.
 A declining stock to utilisation ratio for major grain
stocks like wheat and maize is a concern, said Kostas Stamoulis,
director of Agricultural Development at FAO's economics unit.
 ""We worry about this,"" Stamoulis told Reuters on the
sidelines of the presentation of the report. 
 ""As prices increase, governments and others are trying to
reduce their stocks to soften the impact of decreased supplies.
This is one of the factors causing high prices ... If there is
another supply shock very soon, like in China for example, then
the shock will happen amidst low stocks.""
 Global food prices hit a record high in February, and the
FAO said last week that further oil price spikes and stockpiling
by importers keen to head off unrest would hit already volatile
cereal markets.
 Food prices are projected to rise over the next decade and
stay at levels on average above those of the past decade, the
agency said on Monday.
 Urgent coordinated international action was needed to ensure
security of food supplies, including improvement of market
regulation and transparency as well as of statistics on food
commodity markets, establishment of emergency stocks and
provision of safety nets, the FAO said.

NUMBER OF UNDERNOURISHED UNACCEPTABLY HIGH
 The number of undernourished people in the world has fallen
to 925 million people last year from an estimated 2009 peak of
1.023 billion, but it remained unacceptably high, the FAO said.
 In 2010, 16 percent of developing countries' populations
were undernourished, down from 18 percent in 2009 but still well
above the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goal to halve to 10
percent the share of the hungry between 1990 and 2015, it said.
 The number of hungry people could fall by 100-150 million
people if women farmers were given the same access to production
and financial resources as men, the agency said.
 The yield gap between men and women farmers averages around
20-30 percent, mostly due to differences in resource use, the
report said, citing industry studies. 
 Farm output in developing countries could rise by 2.5-4.0
percent if yields on the land farmed by women increased to the
levels achieved by men. That in turn would reduce the global
number of undernourished people by 12-17 percent, it said.
 ""We must eliminate all forms of discrimination against women
under the law, ensure that access to resources is more equal ...
and make women's voices heard in decision-making at all levels,""
FAO's Director General Jacques Diouf said in the report.
 ""Women must be seen as equal partners in sustainable
development,"" he said.

 By Gergely Szakacs and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, March 7 (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament filled
only two of four vacant jobs at the central bank on Monday,
leaving the current governor dominant on policy but under
growing pressure to resign in a deepening political dispute.
 Analysts had expected the ruling Fidesz party to turn the
bank to a more pro-growth course, but both appointees took a
cautious line on policy on Monday and they will remain in a
minority on the policy board until the other posts are filled.
 It was not clear why Fidesz had held off filling the rest of
the 7-strong panel, although one analyst said it could be a
concession to EU protests over the issue at a time when Hungary
holds the bloc's rotating presidency.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
last week that the European Commission could sue Hungary over
changes in the central bank law which are at the heart of the
pressure the government has put on the bank.
 Governor Andras Simor told a news conference shortly after
the nominations in parliament's economic committee that a
government official had asked him if he would resign ahead of
the Council changes.
 ""A few weeks ago I had a discussion with a high-ranking
government official and he asked me during our conversation
whether now, that the composition of the Monetary Council will
change, whether I wanted to resign,"" Simor said.
 ""I told (the official) that I will not resign, as I have
made clear several times so far...to which (the official)
responded whether I was aware that there will be tough battles
ahead.""
 Simor declined to name the official and reiterated that he
wanted to fill his mandate which runs until March 2013.
 The Prime Minister has said publicly he would have sacked
Simor if he had been able to.
 But the Governor himself remains independent.
""The governor of the National Bank of Hungary cannot be
forced to resign either through threats or through
intimidation,"" Simor told the news conference on Monday.
 Parliament, in which Fidesz has a two-thirds majority,
rubber-stamped the bank appointments on Monday.
 
 SHADOW BOARD
 Fidesz has also put former governor Zsigmond Jarai in charge
of the bank's supervisory board and both economists nominated on
Tuesday -- Ferenc Gerhardt and Andrea Bartfai-Mager -- worked
for Jarai at the bank before 2007.
 The former governor on Friday criticised the high pay of
managers and spending on public relations at the bank, adding to
pressure on the current management.
 ""Simor's life will indeed be made more difficult with a more
meddling NBH supervisory body and a more dovish MPC to handle.
It will not be easy,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.
 There were also media reports last week that Fidesz was
struggling to find candidates willing to accept the posts after
it slashed central bank pay last year and Fidesz officials have
signalled wages at the bank will rise later this year.
 ""It is unclear why four council nominees were not announced
today. One theory is that the government only announced two new
council members at this stage given the recent criticism by the
ECB,"" said Koon Chow at Barclays in London.
 ""This would leave the council with the legal minimum 5
members and leave the government some degrees of freedom over
future appointees.""
 Both nominees stressed the importance of fighting inflation
in a parliament committee, and said the bank should support the
government's policies without threatening its main objective.
 The forint was unfazed by the appointments and Simor's
comments, while yields on the front end rose a few points, as
some traders said the new policymakers did not appear to be as
dovish as some people in the market had feared.
 Gerhardt said that inflation was the ""number one enemy"", and
he believed the bank would keep rates at the current level of 6
percent for a while. He also said financial stability -- an
argument for keeping rates high to keep foreign capital in
Hungary -- was as important a factor as inflation.
 The outgoing council has raised rates three times -- by a
total of 75 basis points -- since November but held fire last
month.

 * MTS warned energy firms business in Turkmenistan is risky
 * Russian diplomacy breaks silence, backs MTS in Turkmen row
 
 By Vladimir Soldatkin
 MOSCOW, March 7 (Reuters) - Russia's Foreign Ministry on
Monday threw its weight behind the country's top mobile telecoms
firm, MTS, pledging to defend its interests in a row with
gas-rich Turkmenistan which suspended its licence.
 The dispute is aggravated by Moscow's hunt for Ashgabat's
huge gas reserves -- also an attraction for the European Union
trying to secure access to Turkmen gas for its Nabucco pipeline
project, a rival to the Russia-sponsored South Stream link.
 Apart from exports to Russia, Turkmenistan, with the world's
fourth-largest reserves of the fuel, also supplies its gas to
China and Iran and eyes a route to India and Pakistan via
Afghanistan to cut dependence on former imperial master Moscow.
 MTS, part of oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Sistema, had an 85
percent share of Turkmenistan's mobile market until its licence
was suddenly suspended last year for reasons that the company
said ""were never fully justified"". 
 ""We believe it is a matter of principle that the
conscientious Russian investor's interests are upheld. We will
provide necessary help to MTS in the future,"" the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
 The rebuke was issued as a response to the Turkmen Foreign
Ministry's riposte to MTS last week, when Ashgabat said it had
not received its fair share of the ""enormous profits"" generated
by the operator in the country.
Last week MTS sent a letter to participants of
Turkmenistan's oil and gas roadshow in Singapore, warning energy
majors of the ""perils"" of investing in the Central Asian nation.
 It said its sad experience in the country should serve as a
""cautionary tale"" for all those doing business in Turkmenistan.
 MTS said it had invested over $188 million in Turkmenistan
since 2005 and serviced more than 2.4 million customers. It had
previously said that it could incur total losses of about $600
million following the licence suspension.
 Relations between Moscow and Ashgabat soured after a dispute
over a pipeline rupture in 2009, which ultimately led to a sharp
reduction in Turkmen gas exports to Russia on the back of
declining demand for energy as the economic downturn bit.

 BELGRADE, March 7 (Reuters) - Serbia's fiscal policies as
agreed with the IMF are not likely to change after Prime
Minister Mirko Cvetkovic also took on the finance portfolio in a
government reshuffle, officials and analysts said on Monday.
 On Sunday night, Cvetkovic said a wider government reshuffle
would remove Finance Minister Diana Dragutinovic, a fiscal
conservative, and see him the finance ministry portfolio in
addition to his responsibilities as prime minister.
 ""I don't see Cvetkovic as someone who will be less hawkish
when fiscal and spending policies are concerned,"" said Danica
Popovic, a lecturer with the faculty of economy at Belgrade
University. ""He demonstrated it when he adamantly refused to
increase wages of school teachers during their recent strike. So
no changes in financial policy.""
Under a three billion euro stand-by agreement with the
International Monetary Fund that expires next month, Serbia has
pledged to maintain its budget deficit at 4.1 percent of gross
domestic product this year and grow at three percent of GDP.
 Belgrade is also expected to seek a new IMF deal that will
continue to contain government spending ahead of elections
scheduled in 2012.
 Cvetkovic previously served as finance minister and has a
doctorate in economics.
 ""I don't think that we're going to see a big difference,""
said one diplomat in Belgrade. ""Cvetkovic was a former finance
minister himself and economist, so I think actually it probably
puts the finance ministry in maybe a stronger hand.""
 ""Frankly, (the ex-finance minister) was not really known as
a strong player in the cabinet.""
 Dragutinovic won praise for her economic expertise, but was
seen as less effective in winning support for her positions in
Serbia's pro-Western coalition government.
 A finance ministry official said Serbian law should prevent
a significant expansion of spending.
 ""We have this fiscal responsibility law; we have this clear
limitation,"" the official said. ""I suppose that there will be no
major changes in government policy as the government has
accepted the fiscal rules.""
 Although Serbia's economy is growing and its dinar has
stabilised in recent months, many Serbs are unhappy with the
slow pace of integration into the European Union and their
relatively modest standard of living, creating additional
pressures on the government.
 Sasa Djogovic, an analyst with the Belgrade-based Institute
for Market Research, called the dismissal, along with the
elimination of several Serbian cabinet positions and some
personnel changes, ""a facelift before elections.""
 ""The government will stay almost as it was, only slightly
streamlined,"" he said. ""But as with every facelift, this one
cannot conceal all the wrinkles and that's why they will need
the IMF and a precautionary deal with IMF.""

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - The euro jumped to a four-month
high against the dollar on Monday as expectations of a euro zone
interest rate hike next month helped it vault back above $1.40
and investors shrugged off a ratings downgrade of Greece.
 Traders said the single currency was lifted by reported
buying by Middle East accounts, with gains accelerating as stop
loss orders were triggered on the break of $1.4005 and $1.4025,
though it stalled ahead of an options barrier at $1.4050. 
 However, with the latest data showing speculators' long euro
positions at their highest level since January 2008, analysts
said positioning looked stretched, which could leave the euro
vulnerable to profit-taking.
 The single currency has been strong since European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet surprised investors on
Thursday by saying that interest rates may rise next month, and
analysts said this was likely to keep providing support.
 ""Sentiment is bullish at the moment and we could see a test
of the 1.4080/00 area,"" said Richard Wiltshire, chief foreign
exchange dealer at ETX Capital.
 ""The euro will stay bid on any dips ahead of April's rate
announcement. I would assume they can't change their rhetoric,
and we have seen a growing number of ECB officials talking about
rate hikes sooner rather than later"".
 Market players were watching for comments from Trichet at a
news conference, expected around midday, with traders saying
further hawkish comments could see the euro consolidate its
gains above the key $1.40 level.
 The single currency rose 0.3 percent to a four-month high of
$1.4031, according to Reuters data.
 With the euro having breached resistance at its early
February peak of $1.3862 during last week's rally, one possible
upside target is now $1.4283, a peak on charts hit on EBS in
early November.
 The dollar also fell to a four-month low against a currency
basket of 76.166.

 RATE DIFFERENTIALS
 The euro had lost ground after Moody's slashed Greece's debt
rating by three notches and kept it on review for a further
possible downgrade, though the falls proved short-lived.
 ""There's a bit of bad news with the Greece downgrade and
Ireland wanting to renegotiate (its) bailout and there's some
focus on this, but it's too early for concerns about sovereign
debt to really come back and hurt the euro,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 Adding to the negative tone, Fitch downgraded Spain's
ratings on Friday.
 In an interview published on Monday, ECB Executive Board
member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said an April rate increase
was possible as the central bank continues its mission to
control inflation.
 The ECB's stance is in contrast to the U.S. Federal Reserve,
which is expected to keep monetary policy loose for some time
as it stays more concerned about the outlook for growth than
about inflationary pressures. 
 ""Despite signs of a recovery in the U.S., the Fed will
continue to fight growth risks while the ECB will fight
inflation risks,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a report.
 ""With the ECB signaling a rate hike in April to alleviate
inflationary pressures, EUR/USD should remain well supported as
interest rate differentials work in favour of EUR.""
 The euro was steady against the yen at 115.06, having
retreated from Friday's peak of 116.00 yen, the euro's highest
against the yen since May 2010.
 A trader for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo said Japanese
exporters sold the euro on Friday as it rallied, and added they
might still try to sell the euro above 115 yen.

 * Says willing to work with Japan to find substitutes
 * Purchasing nations critical of China export quotas
(Adds details, background)
 BEIJING, March 7 (Reuters) - Economies that have come to
depend on China for rare earths metals should accept that Beijing
has real environmental concerns that make curtailing exports
necessary, the Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said on
Monday.
 China produces about 97 percent of the global supply of rare
earth minerals used in smartphones, electric car motors and
high-tech industrial equipment. Beijing cut export quotas by 40
percent last year, alarming buyers and trading partners.
 China has again cut export quotas for the first half of 2011
by 35 percent from the first half of last year, and the United
States has said it could complain to the World Trade Organisation
about the restrictions. [ID:nN18185675]
 But Chen said the quotas were for legitimate environmental
reasons. He said he had seen the ravages from using acid to leach
the minerals from the earth.
 ""The Chinese government faces immense environmental
pressures, and I hope everyone can understand the decision to
impose parallel reductions and limits on mining, processing,
domestic applications and exports,"" Chen told a news conference
held as part of China's annual parliamentary session.
 Chen said that his government was willing to work with Japan,
the main consumer of rare earths used in electronics products, to
find substitutes for the metals, which he said were increasingly
scarce.
 ""We have to find ways of re-using rare metals and also
substitute materials for them, and we're willing to engage in
joint research on that,"" he said.
 Japan said late in February that it planned to cut its rare
earth consumption by a third within a few years to reduce its
reliance on China's supply. [ID:nTOE71N07M].
 For its part, China last month announced a shake-up of its
rare earths industry, vowing ""reasonable"" quotas on mining and
exports to bring order to the small but strategic sector.
[ID:nTOE71F05U]

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a four-month
high on Monday, pushing above the key $1.40 level on reported
buying by Middle East accounts and expectations of higher
interest rates as the market shrugged off a ratings cut on
Greece.
 The euro has been underpinned since European Central Bank
president Jean-Claude Trichet surprised investors on Thursday by
saying that euro zone interest rates may rise next month, and
analysts said this was likely to keep providing support.
 The dollar fell to a four-month low against a basket of
currencies on expectations that U.S. monetary policy, by
contrast, will stay loose.
 With long euro positions looking stretched, analysts said
the euro could be vulnerable to profit-taking, especially above
$1.40.
 The single currency  rose 0.2 percent to a four-month
high of $1.4020, according to Reuters data, extending gains
after breaking above reported stop loss orders at $1.4005.
 Traders said buying by Middle East accounts helped lift the
currency, which had earlier fallen after Moody's slashed
Greece's debt rating by three notches and kept it on review for
a further possible downgrade. [ID:nLDE7260D6]
 ""There's a bit of bad news with the Greece downgrade and
Ireland wanting to renegotiate (its) bailout and there's some
focus on this, but it's too early for concerns about sovereign
debt to really come back and hurt the euro,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 Adding to the negative tone, Fitch downgraded Spain's
ratings on Friday. [ID:nLDE7230QU]
 The single currency broke above Friday's four-month high of
$1.4009 hit on the EBS trading platform. Traders cited options
barriers at $1.4050.
 With the euro having breached resistance at its early
February peak of $1.3862 during last week's rally, one possible
upside target is now $1.4283, a peak on charts hit on EBS in
early November.
 Latest positioning data from the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission pointed to the potential for profit-taking,
however, showing speculators increasing bets in favour of the
euro to the highest level since January 2008. [IMM/FX]
 The dollar index <.DXY> hit a four-month low of 76.221.

 RATE DIFFERENTIALS
 The dollar gained support after Friday's above-forecast U.S.
jobs data, which analysts said helped prevent the euro leaping
well above $1.40, though gains were limited as expectations that
U.S. policy will stay loose remained intact. [ID:nOAT004757]
 Strong job growth is seen necessary for the Federal Reserve
to hold off from conducting further rounds of quantitative
easing. The Fed's second round of QE, consisting of $600 billion
in bond purchases, is due to be completed in June.
 ""Despite signs of a recovery in the U.S., the Fed will
continue to fight growth risks while the ECB will fight
inflation risks,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a report.
 ""With the ECB signalling a rate hike in April to alleviate
inflationary pressures, EUR/USD should remain well supported as
interest rate differentials work in favour of EUR.""
 The euro was steady against the yen at 115.11 ,
having retreated from Friday's peak of 116.00 yen, the euro's
highest against the yen since May 2010.
 A trader for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo said Japanese
exporters sold the euro on Friday as it rallied, and added they
might still try to sell the euro above 115 yen.
 The dollar eased 0.2 percent to 82.12 yen , pulling
back from Friday's intraday peak of 83.09 yen, with support seen
around 81.60, a level that held after several tests in late
February and early March.

 * Gold near record peak, silver at 31-year high
 * Euro shrugs off Greece ratings cut, supported by rate view
 
 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices jumped to a
2-1/2-year peak on Monday as worries about supply disruption
increased due to widening clashes in Libya though European
stocks rose as investors picked up bargains after recent falls.
 Unrest in the oil-rich Middle East stoked demand for
precious metals, with gold -- often sought in times of
geopolitical tensions -- rising close to a lifetime high at
$1,434.82 an ounce, while silver surged to a 31-year peak.
 Risk premia on Greek, Portuguese and Spanish debt also rose
after Moody's cut Greece's credit rating by three notches, but
the euro shrugged off the move to hit a four-month high against
the dollar on expectations the European Central Bank may raise
interest rates next month.
 U.S. crude oil futures jumped 2 percent, topping $106.60,
their highest price in 30 months as a counter-offensive by
Libya's Muammar Gaddafi against rebels deepened concern that
Africa's largest holder of oil reserves is headed for civil war.
 U.S. crude is up by more than a fifth in the last two weeks.
 European stocks shrugged off falls in Asian markets, with
the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rising 0.5 percent as
investors bought beaten-down stocks after two weeks of losses. 
 U.S. stock index futures also rose, indicating Wall Street
will rebound from Friday's falls.
 Further gains were, however, limited as investors fret that
a prolonged period of high oil prices could stifle economic
growth and erode corporate profits, while adding to inflationary
pressures.
 ""There was a pretty aggressive selloff towards the last
couple of hours of trading on Friday and we have seen investors
come in and buy from the lows (but) as long as you have crude
prices as high as they are that's going to limit further gains
for equities,"" said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City
Index.
 German government bonds, the euro zone benchmark, failed to
gain much traction from underperforming lower-rated bonds after
the Moody's move. Analysts said last week's aggressively hawkish
ECB stance made some investors more sensitive to the risk of
inflationary prices from high oil prices.
 Yields were up across the German curve, with 10-year Bund
yields last up two basis point at 3.305 percent.
 ""The ECB sees it as an upside risk on inflation so some in
the market see it as more of an inflation risk than a risk to
growth,"" said Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea. ""We would
have to have a more dramatic rise in oil prices for growth to be
a concern.""
 In currencies, the euro rose to a four-month high of $1.4029
after breaking above resistance at $1.40 on Friday on the view
that the ECB will tighten monetary policy before the Federal
Reserve.
 ""Sentiment is bullish at the moment and we could see a test
of the 1.4080/00 area,"" said Richard Wiltshire, chief foreign
exchange dealer at ETX Capital.
 ""The euro will stay bid on any dips ahead of April's rate
announcement. I would assume they can't change their rhetoric,
and we have seen a growing number of ECB officials talking about
rate hikes sooner rather than later"".

 * China finance minister says to boost supply of grain, food
 * Commerce minister says no grounds for faster yuan rise
 
 (Add details, background)
 By Langi Chiang and Koh Gui Qing
 BEIJING, March 7 (Reuters) - China will cut import taxes,
give subsidies to the poor and encourage more food production,
Finance Minister Xie Xuren said on Monday, indicating how the
government plans to deploy its vast wealth to dampen inflation.
 But a stronger exchange rate will play only a minor role in
the efforts to stabilise prices, because appreciation is a
double-edged sword, Commerce Minister Chen Deming said.
 The comments by the two ministers at news conferences during
China's annual session of parliament shed light on how the
country is working to control inflation, which has been running
near its fastest in more than two years.
 Though investors have focused on the role of tighter
monetary policy and the potential for a stronger currency,
Beijing appears to be giving equal billing to large-scale state
spending.
 ""We will put greater emphasis on maintaining overall price
stability,"" Xie said, echoing Premier Wen Jiabao who said in his
work report on Saturday that managing inflation was the
government's top priority this year.
 While the central bank has shifted to a tighter monetary
policy, the finance ministry has been tasked with implementing a
proactive fiscal policy, a description that refers to
stimulative spending -- something that would normally add to
upward pressure on prices.
 Xie said the finance ministry would ensure that it directs
its expenditures to support the fight against inflation.
 ""According to the requirement of making price stability our
top priority, when we implement our fiscal policies, we need to
actively support the production and supply of basic necessities,
such as grains, cotton, vegetables, sugar, meat, eggs and milk,""
he said.
 Other prongs in the government's strategy would be to expand
the supply of materials needed for agricultural production, such
as fertilizer and pesticides, and to building up state reserves
of key commodities to keep prices stable, Xie said.
 ""We will also futher improve the social security system,
increasing subsidies to poor families in urban and rural areas
to ensure that their lives are not affected by price rises.""
 
 CURRENCY APPRECIATION
 At a separate briefing, Commerce Minister Chen said China
would try to expand channels for grain and cotton imports in
order to meet rising demand.
 Although rising Chinese demand could boost global prices for
these commodities, access to a bigger supply is critical to
containing food costs within China.
 Chinese consumer price inflation quickened to an annual pace
of 4.9 percent in January, just shy of its fastest in more than
two years. Food costs were the main driver, rising 10.3 percent
year on year.
 A stronger currency would help reduce import costs for
China, but the government has been reluctant to let the yuan
rise too quickly. Although it hit new highs against the dollar
on Monday, it has only gained 4 percent since being depegged
from the dollar last June.
 Chen said there was no reason for it move any faster.
 ""In the long run, the yuan is on a gradual upward trend.
Right now, we must take a gradual and controllable approach,"" he
said.
 He said that appreciation was a double-edged sword in
reining in prices, but did not elaborate on what he meant.
Previously, Chinese officials have warned that fast appreciation
would only serve to attract more hot money into the country,
adding to inflationary pressure.
 Chen also gave a spirited defence of the yuan policy, which
is criticised by many foreign countries, especially the United
States, as giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage.
 ""There are still voices saying that the yuan is undervalued.
That's totally unreasonable,"" he said. ""China has never intended
to undervalue the yuan to gain competitiveness. We do not pursue
a trade surplus either.""
 With import growth set to outpace export growth, China was
hoping to narrow its trade surplus for the third straight year,
Chen said. China's trade surplus was $183 billion last year,
down from $196 billion in 2009 and a record $295 billion in
2008.

 AMSTERDAM, March 7 (Reuters) - Dutch engineering consultancy
Arcadis said it saw strong competition and price pressure in
many markets but was cautiously optimistic thanks to emerging
market growth and a gradual recovery in the West.
 Arcadis has diversified from the cyclical construction
industry into water management, environmental treatment services
and a plethora of other projects such as the design of green
cities in China and bioterrorism detection in the United States.
 Its takeover of U.S. environmental consultancy Malcolm
Pirnie in 2009 strengthened its position in that market, and the
company said on Monday that a gradual recovery in the U.S and
Europe should boost private sector investments and its orders.
 ""Although government austerity programs are causing
uncertainty, especially in the European infrastructure market,
the economic recovery has a positive impact on the environmental
and buildings market, while emerging markets offer a lot of
potential,"" Chief Executive Harrie Noy said in a statement.
 Arcadis has expanded in several emerging markets,
particularly Brazil and Chile, where it is involved in major
mining and energy projects, and on Monday it said it saw market
conditions there as very favourable.
 Arcadis reported a 12 percent rise in fourth-quarter
earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) to 39.7
million euros on gross revenue of 540 million euros. Analysts in
a Reuters poll had expected EBITA of 39.5 million euros on gross
revenue of 510 million euros.
 The company raised its dividend slightly to 0.47 euros per
share from 0.45 euros per share last year. 
 Arcadis, which competes with Dutch peer Grontmij and U.S.
rival Tetra Tech, said that, barring unforeseen circumstances
and currency effects, it expected an increase of revenue and
profits in 2011.

 HONG KONG, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. crude prices rose nearly
2 percent to 2-1/2 year highs on Monday as worries about supply
disruption increased due to deepening unrest in Libya, while
Asian stocks declined as concerns about the Middle East also
weighed.	
 European shares are expected to open down between 0.4-0.6
percent, according to financial bookmakers. 
 Asian markets have see-sawed following volatile oil in
recent weeks, but the MSCI ex-Japan index is
about a percent away from a 2-1/2 year peak tested in January,
indicating markets have been largely resilient to the Libyan
crisis.	
 Still, investors are worried that a prolonged period of
high oil prices could stifle economic growth and erode corporate
profits, while adding to inflationary pressures in emerging
Asia.	
 On Monday, the MSCI ex-Japan index fell nearly a percent.	
 U.S. crude rose 1.8 percent to a 2-1/2-year high
above $106 a barrel as civil war brewed in Libya, while
investors kept a close eye on top exporter Saudi Arabia, home to
most of OPEC's spare capacity, where clerics forbid protests at
the weekend. .	
 ICE Brent crude for April surpassed $117 a barrel,
trading up 1.2 percent.	
 ""The concern is that with what we are seeing in Libya, it's
purely fear driving the market,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing
director at Commodity Broking Services in Sydney. 
 ""Each time the price moves up a little, people are forced
into the market. Once it's feeding itself, it will continue to
rise,"" Barratt said, adding $120 may be the peak without further
supply disruptions.

 A reasonably strong batch of U.S. data on Friday that showed
the jobless rate falling to a near two-year low failed to boost
sentiment, as investors remained firmly focused on the
developments in the Middle East and the resulting longer-term
impact on oil. .	
 U.S. crude is up by more than a fifth in the last two weeks.	
 The spike in oil combined with soaring food prices present
fresh problems for central banks in Thailand, Malaysia, South
Korea and New Zealand who head for policy meetings this week.	
 The region is a big importer of oil and market players are
worried that sharp increases in prices would stifle growth and
fuel inflationary pressures.	
 
 FAIRLY VALUED?	
 The MSCI APXJ index is trading at 12.7 times forward
12-month earnings, at par with its long-term average, I/B/E/S
data showed -- indicating that markets are now fairly valued.	
 ""Higher oil prices are a key factor weighing on investor
sentiment. Heavier energy costs have numerous negative
implications for a manufacturing-focused energy importer like
South Korea,"" said Y.S. Rhoo, a market analyst at Hyundai
Securities.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei average , Australia's S&P/ASX 200
index and South Korea's KOSPI ended down more
than 1 percent each.	
 Indian stocks fell by nearly 2 percent after a key
ally of the ruling coalition quit, threatening policy
paralysis. 
 Wall Street erased most of its weekly gains on Friday, with
the S&P 500 Index falling by 0.74 percent. The CBOE
Volatility Index , Wall Street's fear gauge, rose slightly
to 19.11 but stayed well below a May peak of 48.	
 Rising tensions in the Middle East also stoked demand for
precious metals and government bonds.	
 Gold , often sought in times of geopolitical tensions,
rose to near a lifetime high at $1,434.60 an ounce, while silver
surged 3 percent to 31-year highs as investors piled into safe

 Treasury debt prices stabilised after Friday's gains with
benchmark ten year notes at 3.49 percent, a shade
above a one-month low of 3.39 percent hit earlier this month. 
 In currencies, the dollar struggled against a basket of
major currencies after failing to get a big boost from
the U.S. data, while the euro was supported on
expectations of an interest rate hike next month from a hawkish
European Central Bank.	
 The kiwi dollar held above a one-year low versus

 * Crude trading around highest price in over two years
(Adds details of Japanese source)	
 By Jackie Frank and Lewis Krauskopf	
 WASHINGTON/SINGAPORE, March 7 (Reuters) - The U.S.
government reiterated that it could tap its strategic oil
reserves in order to safeguard economic growth as surging
gasoline prices increase pressure for action.	
 While longstanding U.S. policy is to release reserves only
in the event of a significant and immediate supply shortage,
some analysts say the Obama administration may feel compelled to
try to tamp down prices that are being fueled both by outages in
Libya and concern unrest could spread in the Middle East.	
 Reflecting market worries over unrest, crude futures prices
were trading in Asia on Monday around their highest levels in
more than two years.	
 Echoing comments made by a number of Obama officials over
the past week, White House Chief of Staff William Daley told NBC
television's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday: ""We are looking at the
options. The issue of the reserves is one we are considering."" 
 ""It is something that only is done -- has been done -- in
very rare occasions. There's a bunch of factors that have to be
looked at and it is just not the price,"" he added. ""All matters
have to be on the table when you go through -- when you see the
difficulty coming out of this economic crisis we're in and the
fragility of it.""	
 
 He spoke just before a survey showed the second-largest
two-week rise in gasoline pump prices ever. The national average
for a gallon of self-serve, regular gas was $3.50 on March 4,
according to the influential Lundberg Survey of about 2,500 gas
stations, up 32.7 cents from the Feb. 18. For details, see

 Congress has pressured the Obama administration to look to
the emergency oil supplies as an option to ease consumers' fears
over rising U.S. gasoline prices, which are nearing the all-time
high of $4.1124 per gallon hit on July 11, 2008, according to
the Lundberg Survey.	
 Higher oil prices could undermine the fragile U.S. economic
recovery and damage President Barack Obama politically as he
moves toward a 2012 re-election bid.	
 
 NOT 2008	
 The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds 727 million
barrels of oil, or about 38 days of consumption, and has only
been tapped a handful of times since it was created in the
mid-1970s after the Arab oil embargo. It was last used in 2005
following Hurricane Katrina.	
 Thus far the International Energy Agency (IEA) -- which
coordinates reserves policy among the world's major energy
consuming countries -- has made clear it will rely first on OPEC
to fill the void left by the violence in Libya, which has cut
off an estimated 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of output.	
 IEA members South Korea and Japan, among the world's top 5
crude oil importers, have no immediate plans to tap into
strategic reserves, sources said.	
 ""There is no concern at all over supply shortages,"" said an
official with Japan's Trade Ministry, which is in charge of the
country's strategic oil reserves.	
 The official declined to be identified because he is not
authorised to be quoted by the media.	
 OPEC powerhouse Saudi Arabia has stepped up production
significantly, but oil prices remain high. The risk for markets
is that the wave of North African and Middle East protests could
spread to major Gulf oil producers, cutting off supplies that
would be impossible to make up from other producers.	
 Despite longstanding U.S. policy on the SPR, there are
reasons to believe the reserves could be used more liberally
now.	
 Unlike in 2008, when oil prices shot to nearly $150 a barrel
in a demand-led rally, the rise this year is driven by a loss of
supply -- a distinction that could give Obama more latitude to
tap the reserves, even though Libya ships only a fraction of its
oil to the United States.	
 In addition, the global economy is in a more precarious
state than was generally believed at the start of 2008, prior to
the financial crisis.	
 ""Sovereign debt issues need time and growth to resolve. High
oil prices threaten that outcome. No leader will want to preside
over a recession that they had the tools to avert,"" said
Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JP Morgan.	
 His outlook calls for a possible SPR release if Brent crude
pushes materially above $120 a barrel. 
 It traded above $117 a barrel on Monday, up more
than 14 percent in the last two weeks. Last week, the price hit
its highest level since 2008. U.S. crude futures rose to
more than $106 a barrel on Monday, also their highest level
since 2008.	
 U.S. federal law allows the government to tap the reserve
during a national energy supply shortage that raises petroleum
prices and could damage the economy. The president has the
authority to determine such an emergency.	
 While the reserves could help make up for lost supplies, it
is unclear how effective they would be in tempering fears that
unrest could spread to other, bigger producers including Saudi
Arabia, where security forces have detained at least 22 minority
Shi'ites following protests last week. 
 
 GROWING SUPPORT AMONG DEMOCRATS	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner last week played
down risks to oil supply, but also reminded lawmakers of the
emergency stockpile. 
 ""If necessary, those reserves could be mobilized to help
mitigate the effect of a severe, sustained supply disruption,""
Geithner told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.	
 But there has been growing support among Senate Democrats
for tapping America's emergency oil supply.	
 U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu on Wednesday had ruled out
releasing oil from the reserve, saying ramped-up oil production
in Saudi Arabia should lower the crude price.	
 ""We're hoping market forces will take care of this,"" he
added.

 * Purchases made within scope of euro-denominated FX reserves
 * Europe trying to agree on response to sovereign crisis
(Rewrites, adds details)
 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, March 7 (Reuters) - Japan used its foreign exchange
reserves to purchase 1.03 billion euros ($1.44 billion) of bonds
issued by a fund European officials established to prevent the
spread of a sovereign debt crisis, Japan's finance ministry said
on Monday.
 Japan's purchases totalled 20.5 percent of the 5 billion
euros in five-year bonds that the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) sold in January to help it fund a bailout for
Ireland.
 Japan's finance minister had pledged in January to buy some
of the debt to bolster confidence in the EFSF. The purchases were
within the scope of existing euro-denominated assets, so there
was no net effect on the country's currency reserves.
 European leaders will meet for a summit on March 11 to debate
a more comprehensive response to the lack of confidence in public
finances caused by high budget deficits and heavy outstanding
debt.
 A Japanese finance ministry official revealed details of the
EFSF bond purchases after data showed foreign exchange reserves
fell slightly to $1.091 trillion at the end of February from
$1.092 trillion at the end of January due to falling bond prices.
 Japan's foreign reserves, the world's second-biggest after
China's, hit a record high of $1.118 trillion at the end of
October, a month after Japan intervened to keep the yen's rise
from hurting its crucial export sector.
 Japanese authorities spent 2.1249 trillion yen ($25.8
billion) on currency intervention in the month to Sept. 28 last
year, their first foray into the foreign exchange market in more
than six years, but have subsequently stayed out of the market at
least until Feb. 24, ministry data has shown.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, March 7 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose to
2-1/2 year highs on Monday on heightened worries about supply
disruption due to deepening unrest in Libya, while Asian stocks
slipped as concerns about the Middle East and higher energy
prices weighed on equities.	
 Asian markets have see-sawed following volatile oil prices
in recent weeks, but the MSCI ex-Japan index is
barely a percent away from a 2-1/2 year peak tested in January,
indicating markets have been largely resilient to the Libyan
crisis.	
 Still, investors are worried that a prolonged period of high
oil prices could stifle economic growth and erode corporate
profits, while adding to inflationary pressures in emerging
economies.	
 On Monday, the MSCI ex-Japan index was down more than half a
percent.	
 U.S. crude oil futures jumped 1.6 percent, topping
$106, to the highest price in 2-1/2 years on Monday as a
counter-offensive by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi against rebels
deepened concerns that a civil war is brewing in Africa's
largest holder of oil reserves. 
 ICE Brent crude for April was trading at $117.28 a
barrel, up 1.1 percent.	
 ""The concern is that with what we are seeing in Libya, it's
purely fear driving the market,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing
director at Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.	
 ""Each time the price moves up a little, people are forced
into the market. Once it's feeding itself, it will continue to
rise,"" Barratt said, adding $120 may be the peak without further
supply disruptions.

 A reasonably strong batch of U.S. data on Friday that showed
the jobless rate falling to a near two-year low failed to boost
sentiment, as investors remained firmly focused on the
developments in the Middle East and the resulting longer-term
impact on oil. .	
 U.S. crude is up by more than a fifth in the last two weeks.	
 The spike in oil combined with soaring food prices present
fresh problems for central banks in Thailand, Malaysia, South
Korea and New Zealand who head for policy meetings this week.	
 The region is a big importer of oil and market players are
worried that sharp increases in prices would stifle growth and
fuel inflationary pressures.	
 
 FAIRLY VALUED?	
 The MSCI APXJ index is trading at 12.7 times forward
12-month earnings, at par with its long-term average, I/B/E/S
data showed -- indicating that markets are now fairly valued.	
 ""Higher oil prices are a key factor weighing on investor
sentiment. Heavier energy costs have numerous negative
implications for a manufacturing-focused energy importer like
South Korea,"" said Y.S. Rhoo, a market analyst at Hyundai
Securities.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei average , Australia's S&P/ASX 200
index and South Korea's KOSPI fell more than one
percent each, tracking a weaker Wall Street close.	
 Wall Street erased most of its weekly gains on Friday, with
the S&P 500 Index falling by 0.74 percent, as fears of
more geopolitical turmoil overshadowed positive U.S. data. 
 The CBOE Volatility Index , Wall Street's fear gauge,
rose slightly to 19.11 but stayed well below a May peak of 48.	
 Rising tensions in the Middle East also stoked demand for
precious metals and government bonds.	
 Gold , often sought in times of geopolitical
tensions, rose to near a lifetime high at $1,434.60 an ounce,
while silver surged 3 percent to 31-year highs as investors
piled into safe havens. Gold hit a record $1,440 last week.	
 Treasury debt prices stabilised after Friday's gains with
benchmark ten year notes at 3.49 percent, a shade
above a one-month low of 3.39 percent hit earlier this month.	
 In currencies, the dollar struggled against a basket of
major currencies after failing to get a big boost from
the U.S. data, while the euro was supported on
expectations of an interest rate hike next month from a hawkish
European Central Bank.	
 The kiwi dollar held above a one-year low versus
the euro and a five-month low against the dollar but is set to
stay pressured ahead of an expected interest rate cut this week.

 * Resignation due to age, arduous job: statement
 * No replacement named
(Adds background)
 KHARTOUM, March 6 (Reuters) - Sudan's central bank governor
Sabir Mohammad al-Hassan has resigned, the bank said on Sunday,
four months ahead of the secession of the country's
oil-producing south.
 The departure of the long-serving governor is likely to
cause dismay in a country facing the double challenge of an
economic crisis and the imminent loss of about a quarter of its
territory.
 ""The economic situation now is precarious and the country is
moving towards secession,"" former state minister of finance Abda
al-Mahdi told Reuters.
 ""The departure of Dr Sabir, who is quite well respected in
economic circles, will create anxiety in an already difficult
situation,"" said Mahdi, who heads the economic consultancy
UNICONS.
 Sudan's south is due to split away from the north on July 9
after southerners overwhelmingly voted to declare independence
in a referendum in January -- a vote promised in a 2005 peace
deal that ended decades of north-south civil war.
 Uncertainty over how the two nations will disentangle
themselves, and fears of a return to conflict, have added to an
economic crisis that has created foreign exchange shortages, an
effective currency devaluation and rising inflation.
 The central bank issued a statement saying Hassan, 65, had
decided to step down because of his age and the arduous nature
of the job which was having an impact on his health and family.
 The statement said the governor ""denies reports that
disputes between the economic team led to this resignation.""
 The central bank did not name a replacement.
 Analysts have blamed the economic crisis on years of
government over-spending and mismanagement of large parts of the
economy while the government concentrated on its oil industry.
 The departure of the south -- the source of almost 75
percent of Sudan's 500,000 barrels per day of crude output --
will also deprive the north of much of its foreign export
earnings.
 One commentator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there had been reports Hassan had grown increasingly frustrated
with the country's economic situation and the measures he was
having to take to preserve the country's dwindling foreign
currency reserves.
 In recent months, the central bank has imposed harsh
restrictions on the import of dozens of goods and on hard cash
transfers abroad, leaving many international companies
struggling to repatriate profits and hurting foreign investment.
 Hassan has declined to release details on the size of
Sudan's reserves, telling Reuters last year it was like asking a
woman her age.
 According to an IMF report, Sudan's international reserves
hit a low of $390 million in mid-2009, enough to pay for just
around two weeks' worth of imports and down from $1.58 billion
in 2006.
 The central bank statement said Hassan had been in the job
for 16 years and had overseen the switching of the country's
dinar currency to the Sudanese pound after the 2005
Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
 The U.S.-trained economist worked as an adviser to the
Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund in the
1980s, added the statement.
 The bank said Hassan had handed his resignation to President
Omar Hassan al-Bashir in December and would step down at the end
of his contract, which came on Monday.

 * Want competitiveness pact, stronger budget discipline
 
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, March 6 (Reuters) - Germany's main business lobbies
on Sunday called on countries sharing the euro currency to adopt
tough rules at an upcoming summit aimed at sorting out Europe's
debt crisis.
 In an open letter to euro zone leaders, the heads of the
BDI, BDA, DIHK and ZDH industry associations urged countries to
adopt German proposals aimed at strengthening fiscal discipline.
 ""We thus support the government's proposals for solid
budgets and competitive European economies,"" the leaders wrote.
""Collectivising debt -- as is being debated -- would on the
contrary overburden strong states and weaken Europe.""
 Berlin, with Paris' backing, wants euro zone countries to
agree to a competitiveness pact at the March 11 meeting in
Brussels in exchange for boosting the scope and capacity of an
emergency fund for bailing out countries cut off from the
markets.
 Financial markets are watching the drama closely,
particularly Germany's reluctance to pour more money into the
fund, and the surprise announcement last week that the ECB may
raise interest rates this spring -- heightening anxiety about
Europe's ability to contribute to the global recovery.
 In the letter, the associations described the pact as a
sensible extension of Europe's budgetary rules, and backed plans
gaining support in Europe to adopt debt restraints nationally.
 ""The incentive for solid fiscal policy must be strengthened
through debt brakes in national constitutions. If a country
breaks the stability and growth pact, sanctions must come
automatically,"" it read.
 The groups also voiced support for several initiatives
sought by proponents of more hardline discipline, and opposed by
some weaker states and those with national conflicts.
 They want Europe's next bailout fund, which is to replace
the current fund in 2013, to be activated only as a last resort
when the stability of the whole bloc is in danger, and say it
must include an orderly procedure for state insolvency.
 The euro zone should not issue common bonds at this stage,
and the European Central Bank should immediately stop propping
up weaker states by buying their debt, they said.

 * Government says budget will boost business

(Recasts after speech)
 By Keith Weir
 CARDIFF, March 6 (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron
said on Sunday he would press ahead with efforts to sell British
goods and services abroad and promised the most pro-growth
budget in a generation.
 Cameron has faced criticism for a trip to the Gulf last
month on which he was joined by executives from defence
companies and other businesses. Critics said efforts to boost
arms sales were crass at a time of uprisings across the Middle
East and North Africa.
 ""While there are contracts to be won, jobs to be created;
markets to be defended - I will be there,"" Cameron told a
meeting of his Conservative Party.
 ""If it's making sure Rolls-Royce engines are in the world's
planes, I'll be there,"" added the former public relations
executive. ""If it's making sure skyscrapers in the Gulf are
designed by British architects, I'll be there.""
 Britain is looking to bolster overseas business to help
cushion it from the effects of sharp cuts in public spending.
Cameron, who took office last May, has already made high-profile
trips to India and China with trade missions in tow.
 The Conservative-led coalition plans to reduce government
spending by around 19 percent across most departments as it
seeks to virtually eliminate a record budget deficit over the
next four years.
 The coalition government is seeking to shift the debate from
cuts on to measures to promote growth in its March 23 budget.
 ""The budget in a few weeks' time will tear down the barriers
to enterprise and be the most pro-growth budget this country has
seen for a generation,"" Cameron said, vowing to tackle red tape
and bureaucratic ""enemies of enterprise.""
 Cameron said the government would stick to its tough
medicine despite a faltering economy.
 ""The road ahead will be hard; this year in particular,"" he
said. ""But the plan is right.""
 ""Our credit rating has been confirmed. Market interest rates
are lower. We're on course to balance the books by the end of
this parliament,"" he added.
 The opposition Labour Party says the government is cutting
too much, too fast and risks plunging the country back into
recession as the brakes go on.
 The economic debate has intensified after the economy shrank
by 0.6 percent in the last three months of 2010, while inflation
is running at 4 percent, double the official target.
 Soaring oil prices have made life tougher for British
families. Finance minister George Osborne gave his strongest
signal yet on Saturday he will postpone a planned rise in fuel
duty to counter soaring petrol prices.
 Cameron said he would be watching banks ""like a hawk"" to
ensure they honour a commitment to lend an additional 10 billion
pounds ($16.28 billion) to small companies.

central bank Sabir Mohammad al-Hassan has resigned and is due to
step down on Monday, the Central Bank of Sudan said in a
statement.
 Hassan said his resignation was not caused by any divisions
in his economic team but insisted ""the reasons behind not
wanting to renew his contract is his age and the length of time
he has spent in this post which he described as arduous,""
according to the statement.
 The move, long rumoured, is likely to spark concern in Sudan

overwhelmingly voted to secede in a referendum in January.
 Northern and southern leaders are still locked in

 CAIRO, March 6 (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank said it sold
3 billion Egyptian pounds ($508 million) in domestic treasury
bills on Sunday, well short of the 4.5 billion pounds it had
offered.
 Bankers say demand for Egyptian treasury bills has declined
because of the political turmoil that ousted Hosni Mubarak last
month, partly on concern the value of the pound will depreciate
in coming months.
 The bank had offered 3.5 billion pounds of 266-day T-bills,
but reduced the amount to 2 billion pounds. The average yield
was 12.473 percent. 
 Central bank Deputy Governor Hisham Ramez said the bank had
received 4.2 billion pounds in bids for the 266-day bills, but
the yields on some of the bids were higher than what the Finance
Ministry was willing to pay.
 ""These were the amounts the Finance Ministry was willing to
buy,"" Ramez said by telephone.
 The central bank also sold 1 billion pounds of 91-day
T-bills, the same amount it had asked for, at an average yield
of 11.487 percent, up from 11.097 percent at last week's
auction.
 Total bids on the 91-day bills were 2 billion pounds, Ramez
said.

 * South says north must cooperate over currency, Abyei
 
 By Aaron Maasho
 ADDIS ABABA, March 6 (Reuters) - South Sudan will help the
north get relief on around $38 billion in debt, as long as the
north ""cooperates"" on a border dispute and other issues in the
countdown to the country's split, a southern official said.
 Sudan's oil-producing south is due to separate from the
north on July 9 after its people overwhelmingly voted to secede
in a referendum in January -- a vote promised in a 2005 peace
deal that ended decades of north-south civil war. 
 The sides remain at loggerheads over a list of issues ahead
of the split, including ownership of the disputed Abyei border
area, the scene of clashes in recent days, and the handling of
the country's crippling debt.
 South Sudan has already said it plans to introduce its own
currency after the division and will need the cooperation of its
old civil war foe to redeem the old Sudanese pounds circulating
in its system.
 ""We are ready to join the north in joint efforts for debt
relief,"" said Pagan Amum, secretary general of the south's
ruling Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), at the end of
a week-long meeting with northern leaders in Ethiopia.
 ""But our participation is conditional to the cooperation of
the north in all the other areas including Abyei, as well as
also assuming the redemption of the Sudanese currency as we
change the currency,"" he told Reuters.
 
 JOINT TEAM
 Both sides had agreed to send a joint team to the spring
meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
to campaign for debt relief, said former South African President
Thabo Mbeki, who organised the meeting in the Ethiopian resort
town of Debre Zeit.
 ""We are not dealing with an ordinary routine case of debt
forgiveness,"" Mbeki told reporters in Addis Ababa. 
 ""This will happen in the context of a very important and
fundamental political change in Sudan which would be of interest
not only to the Sudanese but also of immediate interest to the
neighbours and the rest of the continent.""
 Sudan's north-south conflict -- Africa's longest civil war
fought over oil, ideology and religion -- destabilised the whole
region and killed an estimated 2 million people.
 North Sudanese officials have in the past said they would
not divide the debt with the south, as the new nation would not
be able to service it. The SPLM says the north should keep the
debt as it was built up by the Khartoum government.
 The World bank has said Khartoum would need to introduce
wide economic reforms to qualify for relief of multilateral
debt. 
 Nearly 90 percent of Sudan's external debt is owed to
bilateral and commercial creditors, with their own requirements,
and would take at least three years to clear, according to a
paper by the Center for Global Development.
Much of Sudan's debt dates back to the 1960s when borrowed on
poor terms to finance large industrial projects, according to a
note by the IMF.
 Mbeki did not announce breakthroughs on other burning
issues, including the position of contested parts of the
north-south border, the ownership of Abyei or how the south
would pay the north to transport oil through its territory.

 * Blocher already called for SNB head to quit
 * Other parties accuse SVP of electioneering
 
 ZURICH, March 6 (Reuters) - The popular right-wing Swiss
People's Party (SVP) wants to limit the autonomy of the Swiss
National Bank (SNB) on decisions outside its core mandate of
price stability after big losses on currency interventions.
 ""If the SNB leaves its actual mission with large currency
buys, one must be able to supervise the SNB bosses and if
necessary stop them,"" Christoph Blocher, former justice minister
and SVP mastermind, told the SonntagsZeitung newspaper.
 Blocher has already called on SNB chief Philipp Hildebrand
to resign after the central bank posted a 2010 loss of 19.2
billion Swiss francs ($20.74 billion) after ill-fated
interventions to try to fight the currency's strength.
 The SVP, expected to remain Switzerland's biggest party in
national elections in October, plans a motion proposing new
rules in parliament next week to control the central bank.
 ""In extreme cases, currency buys can be necessary to secure
price stability. That is why we need disciplinary supervisory
rules to prevent the managing board contravening their core
mandate and taking on unbelievable risks,"" Blocher said.
 The SNB has repeatedly defended the interventions as being
necessary to fight deflation risk from the soaring franc.
 Blocher also accused Hildebrand of being too much in favour
of more integration with the European Union.
 ""I have the suspicion that Mr Hildebrand wants to play a
role at the European or even global level. He pleads for opening
and integration which does not belong to his area of competency.
He also doesn't rule out tying the franc to the euro,"" he said.
 However, the other main parties in the coalition government
that rules Switzerland have defended the SNB's currency
interventions and the central bank's independence.
 Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said in an
interview with the Finanz und Wirtschaft newspaper on Saturday
that the SNB had managed to dampen the franc's rise somewhat and
said the situation had improved in the meantime.
 Otto Ineichen from the liberal Free Democrats told the
Sonntag newspaper the SVP was going too far with its election
campaign and was defaming the SNB with ""false accusations"".
 The safe-haven franc has soared to record highs against the
euro and the dollar due to unrest in north Africa and the euro
zone's debt crisis, prompting calls for the government to
intervene as Swiss exporters suffer.
 The Swiss government has announced measures to help firms to
deal with the strong Swiss franc, including increased funding
for the tourism industry and support for companies to boost
innovation.

 * Accord similar to one with Jordan
 
 JERUSALEM, March 5 (Reuters) - Egyptian factories that use
products from Israel under a U.S.-sponsored trade deal have
resumed work, overcoming disruptions caused by the power
struggle in Cairo, an Israeli official said on Saturday.
 Israelis worry that the fall of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak could erode the countries' landmark 1979 peace accord,
which Washington shored up by waiving American import duties on
textiles manufactured in Egypt with help from Israel.
 Gabby Bar, head of the Middle East department at Israel's
Industry and Trade Ministry, said supplies to Egyptian factories
had been halted during the February upheaval in Cairo, which saw
widespread curfews, worker strikes, and bank and port closures.
 ""Everything is back on track,"" Bar told Israel Radio.
 ""Indeed, we are seeing today a desire by Egyptian firms
which are very interested in continuing to operate in this
manner, as it allows them to stand competitively in the American
market, because they are selling with a full customs waiver.""
 The Israeli-Egyptian cooperation, known as the Qualifying
Industrial Zones (QIZ) deal, was instituted in 2005 and mirrors
a similar accord between Israel and Jordan from the late 1990s.
Bar said banking operations had yet to be fully restored in
Egypt and that employees at some factories were still on strike.

stability. We must, therefore, make it our top priority in
macroeconomic control to keep overall price levels stable.
 ""We need to make the most of favourable conditions, such as
an ample supply of manufactured goods and our abundant grain
reserves and considerable foreign exchange reserves, endeavor to
overcome the adverse effects of imported and structural
inflation, cushion the upward pressure for costs of factors of
production, and correctly guide market expectations to resolutely
curb prices.""
 Boosting domestic demand
 ""Expanding domestic demand is a long-term strategic principle
and basic standpoint of China's economic development as well as a
fundamental means and an internal requirement for promoting
balanced economic development.
 ""We will actively boost consumer demand. We will continue to
increase government spending used to help expand consumption, and
increase subsidies to low-income urban residents and farmers.""
 Property prices
 ""We will further implement and improve policies for
regulating the real estate market and firmly curb the excessively
rapid rise of housing prices in some cities.""
 Global challenges
 ""This year, our country still faces an extremely complex
situation for development. The world economy will continue to
recover slowly, but the foundation for recovery is not solid.
Economic growth in developed economies is weak, their
unemployment rates are and will remain high, and some countries
are still under the threat of their sovereign debt crises.""
 Loose monetary policy in developed economies
 ""Major developed economies have further eased monetary
policies, global liquidity has increased greatly, the prices of
major commodities and the exchange rates of major currencies have
become more volatile in the international market, asset bubbles
and inflationary pressure have grown in emerging markets,
protectionism continues to heat up, competition in the
international market is becoming more intense, and there are
still many unstable and uncertain factors.""

 By Zhou Xin and Koh Gui Qing	
 BEIJING, March 5 (Reuters) - China is on course for another
five years of robust growth although inflation threatens social
stability and must be tamed, Premier Wen Jiabao said on
Saturday.	
 In China's version of a ""State of the Union"" address to the
annual parliament session, Wen said the top priority this year
was to curb price rises that are making life difficult for
ordinary people. 
 But in laying out a plan for the next five years, he said
the drivers of China's meteoric economic rise were still in
place and that the government was in an even stronger position
to steer the world's second-largest economy toward prosperity.	
 ""From a domestic perspective, factors favouring China's
development and the positive long-term development have not
changed,"" Wen said in a work report to the National People's
Congress.	
 
 
 With tens of millions of people moving to cities from farms,
the country further opening to global trade and investment and
factories and computers spreading deeper into the hinterland,
China would aim for growth of 7 percent a year from 2011 to
2015.	
 That would mark a slowdown from the 11.2 percent China
averaged over the past five years. But the target is more of a
worst-case scenario than a true forecast -- from 2006 to 2010,
it had aimed for 7.5 percent growth.	
 ""There is huge potential demand in the market, the supply of
funds is ample, the overall scientific and educational level of
the people is rising,"" Wen said. ""The government's ability to
exercise overall control and respond to major challenges has
increased significantly.""	
 
 INFLATION NOW	
 The premier's annual address is given in the cavernous Great
Hall of the People, crowded with thousands of delegates vetted
by the Communist Party to acclaim and approve its policies.	
 But Wen's televised speech is also aimed at hundreds of
millions of ordinary citizens who Party leaders fear could
become sources of anger unless grievances about price rises,
unaffordable housing and expensive healthcare are eased.	
 Wen made clear that addressing those concerns would
preoccupy China's economic policy, shaping decisions on
everything from farmers' incomes to the yuan exchange rate.	
 ""Recently, prices have risen fairly quickly and inflation
expectations have increased,"" Wen said. ""This problem concerns
the people's well-being, bears on overall interests and affects
social stability. We must, therefore, make it our top priority
in macroeconomic control to keep overall price levels stable.""	
 For 2011, the government aimed to contain average inflation
to 4 percent, Wen said. Inflation has been running near a
two-year high of more than 5 percent in recent months. Lofty
home price rises have also defied government cooling efforts.	
 Failure to rein in price rises for food, housing and other
goods could become more than an economic problem for the ruling
Communist Party, which is jittery about social unrest,
especially after the upheavals shaking the Middle East.	
 Wen said China was also looking to generate new sources of
domestic demand that would wean economic growth off its reliance
on cheap exports and infrastructure projects.	
 ""Expanding domestic demand is a long-term strategic
principle and basic standpoint of China's economic development
as well as a fundamental means and an internal requirement for
promoting balanced economic development,"" he said.	
 
 COMPLEXITIES	
 Wen did not mention the popular uprisings that have
shattered authoritarian governments across the Middle East, and
observers see scant risk of China's one-party state soon
succumbing to mass unrest. 
 But his speech showed that leaders in Beijing want to head
off such risks, particularly anger stemming from price rises and
wage gaps.	
 ""The world economy will continue to recover slowly, but the
foundation for recovery is not solid. Economic growth in
developed economies is weak,"" Wen added, noting that some
countries still faced sovereign debt crises.	
 Wen has said government policies would focus on a rural
population of 720 million people, including 153 million migrants
who usually live and work outside their home towns, many working
at building sites and factories that make cheap exports.	
 Stark income inequalities between urban and rural areas have
stirred resentment and kept rural residents from joining the
rising domestic consumption that Beijing hopes will drive
growth.

 NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - World stocks and the U.S.
dollar fell on Friday as oil prices rose on escalating violence
in Libya, overshadowing a U.S. jobs report that showed the
economic recovery shifting up a gear.
 Gold advanced above $1,430 an ounce and U.S. Treasury debt

September 2008, and Brent crude rose above $116 a barrel as

 The U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly fell and employers

because the market had rallied on Thursday on expectations of
solid hiring by private employers.
 The Labor Department reported hiring by U.S. employers in
February hit the highest level since last May as unemployment
dipped to 8.9 percent, an almost two-year low.

786,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2011 02:20PM ET</span>",FOREX-US dollar seen lower next week after jobs data," * Dollar likely to fall in coming week on rate outlook
 * U.S. jobs data solid but not enough for investors
 NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar is likely to
fall in the week ahead as investors continue to bet that
interest rates in the euro zone will rise ahead of those in the
world's largest economy.
 U.S. February jobs data came in a touch better than
expected on Friday but disappointed investors who had hoped for
an even stronger report.
 Investors see strong U.S. jobs growth as necessary for the
Fed to end its second round of quantitative easing and instead
tighten monetary policy by raising rates.
 The U.S. situation is in sharp contrast with that of the
euro zone, where the zone's common currency is likely to remain
supported after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet strongly hinted at an interest rate rise in April,
bolstering the view the ECB will tighten monetary policy before
the Federal Reserve.
 ""We had Mr. Trichet warning Thursday that the ECB is
considering a rate hike and perhaps the start of a rate hike
cycle,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX
Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey. ""The U.S. job number
came in as expected and provided little direction to the market
other than it did not disappoint and that will support risk
appetite.""
 For the week, the euro gained 1.7 percent against the
dollar on electronic trading platform EBS, the third straight
weekly gain, while the dollar gained 0.8 percent against the
yen.
 A slew of technical factors also indicate investor caution
on the dollar, particularly against the euro.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversals last traded at -1.175
on Friday, according to Reuters data, with a bias toward euro
puts and dollar calls, suggesting more investors are betting
the euro will fall than will rise.
 But that compares with late November when one-month risk
reversals posted at -2.83, suggesting negative sentiment on the
euro has eased substantially. The euro has already gained more
than 6 percent against the dollar since that time.
 Those gains pushed the euro/dollar above above its 200-week
moving average this week for the first time since mid November,
piercing a strong long-term resistance level.
 There is now little in the way to prevent the euro's rise
to $1.4283 on EBS, the November high from which it slid to
$1.2860 in January but from which low it has steadily retraced
higher. Stamford, Connecticut-based Faros Trading sees the euro
making a move to the $1.50 level within the next three months.
 Nearer term, the buy signal triggered on Feb. 23 when the
12-day and 26-day moving average convergence divergence line
rose above the 9-day signal line is also holding. The MACD is
an indicator of short-term momentum by focusing on exponential
moving averages and closing prices.
 The dollar is also seen struggling against the yen as it
failed to hold onto its initial gains after the jobs data.
 ""Bernanke may be relieved to see another month of
improvement in the unemployment rate, but given the underlying
weakness of the report, the central bank will still argue that
unemployment remains extremely high and therefore continued
stimulus could be warranted,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
currency research at GFT in New York.
 With talk that the Fed may even go for a third round of
quantitative easing after the current phase ends in June,
strong jobs growth for at least the next three months is
consequently key to any dollar revival.
 Even ongoing political instability in the Middle East and
North Africa and the threat that it may spread to Saudi Arabia,
a key U.S. ally in the region and a global oil supplier, could
weaken the dollar.
 While the dollar has been regarded as a safe haven in times
of turmoil, some investors suggest higher oil prices would push
other central banks to raise interest rates to counter
inflation even as the Federal Reserve maintains its stimulative
monetary policy, which would again leave investors chasing
yield with little choice but to sell the dollar.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2011 02:12PM ET</span>",Swiss econ min: Basel top-up helps big Swiss banks," ZURICH, March 4 (Reuters) - Big Swiss banks should hold
capital above the new Basel III rules, the Swiss economy
minister was quoted as saying on Friday, adding the tougher
standards gave them a competitive edge.
 After bailing out flagship bank UBS during the financial
crisis, Switzerland is weighing rules that would force big banks
to hold capital in excess of the Basel III banking regulations
and allow them to be broken up in the event of a crisis, so as
to prevent them from dragging down the whole economy.
 Yet the measures, proposed by a committee of experts and set
to be discussed in parliament later this year, have been
criticised as being too tough compared to international
standards.
 ""The too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem needs to be solved,""
Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said in a pre-print of
Saturday's edition of Finanz und Wirtschaft.
 ""For big banks I support the demand for relatively higher
own capital, beyond the requirements of Basel III,"" he said.
""Switzerland cannot afford to jump in as saviour again.""
 SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand has cautioned against
watering down the proposed TBTF standards and has said they help
Swiss banks stand out from foreign peers.
The new rules would require UBS and Credit Suisse to hold
Core Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of at least 10 percent. The
plan has yet to be voted on by parliament.

 STRONG FRANC
 The Swiss franc has been a destination for investors worried
by the euro zone's debt crisis, driving the franc to record
highs against the dollar and euro and prompting complaints from
exporters like watchmaker Swatch Group.
 But so far the Swiss economy has shown few ill effects from
the strong franc.
 Debts in the euro zone were worrying and had caused the euro
to slide, pressuring margins in the export sector,
Schneider-Ammann said.
 ""Nevertheless, I don't advocate interventionism,"" he said.
 The Swiss government has announced measures to help firms to
deal with the strong Swiss franc, including increased funding
for the tourism industry and support for companies to boost
innovation.

 By David Milliken
 LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - A newly hawkish tone by the
European Central Bank has stunned markets but it will probably
not sway the Bank of England, which remains likely to stay on
hold for at least another two months, and possibly much longer,
because of doubts over Britain's economic recovery.
 Euro zone interbank borrowing rates jumped to 20-month highs
on Friday after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, citing the
risk of rising inflation, indicated on Thursday that the bank
might well lift its key interest rate next month.[ID:nLDE7231O1]
 Last month three of the nine officials on the BoE's Monetary
Policy Committee voted for a rate hike; the increased
hawkishness of the ECB could conceivably help to shift more MPC
members towards favouring an early hike in Britain.
 If the ECB raised rates in April, it would make a British
hike easier to justify to the public and politicians. Also,
there would be less of a risk of the British pound 
appreciating against the euro and hurting exports.
 ""They wouldn't look quite so much of an outlier,"" said RBS
economist Ross Walker. ""If they were doing it in isolation it
could lead to a jump in sterling.""
 But market pricing for the next BoE rate change did not
change significantly on Friday from levels seen before Trichet
delivered his bombshell. If anything, the trend over the past
two weeks has been for the markets to show increasing doubts
about an early BoE rate hike, as shown by a rise in short
sterling rate futures  and other measures .
 The reason is that Britain's economic recovery still looks
considerably more shaky than the euro zone's, making any rate
hike more of a gamble.
 ""The fact that the ECB will hike could, at the margin, make
a BoE move more likely. But the most relevant thing for the BoE
is whether the economy bounced back in Q1 from Q4 weakness,""
said Alan Clarke, UK economist at BNP Paribas.
 
 CONTRACTION
 Britain's gross domestic product unexpectedly contracted 0.6
percent in the last quarter of 2010, after two quarters of
strong growth as it came out of recession. The coldest December
in 100 years was partly to blame, but some BoE policymakers
worry there may be an underlying slowdown in the economy.
 Societe Generale economist Brian Hilliard reckons that the
BoE wants to see GDP growth of at least 0.8 percent when
first-quarter figures come out shortly before May's interest
rate meeting. Clarke believes 1 percent growth would be needed
to convince waverers on the MPC that growth is back on track.
 February's tepid services purchasing managers' survey, and
anecdotal evidence of poor sales at retailers, put this rate of
growth in doubt, said Clarke, who expects a rate rise only in
August.
 ""My kneejerk reaction was that we'd be at a strong 1 percent
quarter-on-quarter in Q1, but my feeling now is that we might
not get that,"" he said.
 Even Q1 growth of 1 percent might not be enough for the BoE
to raise rates. Assuming firms should recoup growth lost in
December, this rate would imply that underlying growth in Q4 and
Q1 averaged just 0.2 percent -- well below the 0.5 percent level
that economists think would be consistent with the economy's
long-term trend.
 Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rates 
currently show the chance of a 25 basis point rate hike at next
week's MPC meeting of just 8.3 percent. The probability rises
but remains small for an April rate hike; only in June does the
market start to assume a hike is a near-certainty.
 
 INFLATION
 Of course, growth is not the only factor which the MPC will
consider. Inflation has been well above the BoE's 2 percent
target for more than a year, and is forecast to near 5 percent
in coming months.
 The BoE's central view is that most of the inflation surge
is driven by a higher sales tax, past sterling weakness and a
spike in oil prices which is forecast to fade away. But MPC
members who favour a rate rise argue that tighter policy would
nonetheless help reassure the public and the markets that the
BoE was taking action to tackle inflation.
 However, continued uncertainty about growth gives dovish MPC
members ample room to downplay the risk that heightened
inflation expectations will actually translate into higher wage
payments, and to argue that a rate rise could backfire by
seeming a panicked reaction to inflation.
 If it is still unclear in May whether growth is back on
track, more dovish policymakers may prefer to wait until they
see Q2 growth data at the end of July before raising rates.
 And it is even possible to argue that an early ECB rate hike
could reduce the chances of an early BoE hike. British exports
benefit more from strong growth in overseas markets than from
weak sterling, so if tighter ECB policy slows euro zone growth,
this could outweigh any competitiveness gain for Britain, BNP
Paribas's Clarke said.
 ""If rate hikes in the euro zone are likely to slow demand in
our biggest export partner, then it does take some of the heat
out of the British economy and makes the BoE less likely to
hike. I think it's on an absolute knife edge.""

791,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2011 01:08PM ET</span>",Swiss ban financial transfers to Gaddafi clan," * Swiss ban money transfers to Gaddafi's associates
 * Libyan oil firm Tamoil has refinery in Switzerland
 
 ZURICH, March 4 (Reuters) - Switzerland ratcheted up
pressure on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi by banning transfers
of money that could end up in the hands of his family and
associates.
 Switzerland is working hard to improve its image as a haven
for ill-gotten assets and in February the Swiss government froze
assets of 29 Libyans linked to Gaddafi. It has also frozen any
assets belonging to ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.
 ""Switzerland wants to prevent any financial support of
Muammar Gaddafi and his circle,"" the government said.
 It will also be forbidden to give people linked to Gaddafi
direct or indirect access to money or economic resources, it
added.
 The decision could affect Libyan oil company Tamoil, which
operates a 72,000 barrel-per-day refinery in western
Switzerland.
 When asked about the measure's effect on Tamoil, government
spokesman Andre Simonazzi said: ""With each transaction for
Tamoil the question gets raised -- where's the money going? It's
got to be investigated who would profit.""
 But he said it was not up to the government to run checks on
money movements. ""It's up to the banks and financial
institutions.""
 Tamoil spokesman Laurent Paoliello said on Friday the
company would not be impacted by the new measures.
 ""The decision by the Federal Council confirmed that Tamoil
Switzerland is a Swiss company like any other and we can
continue to work normally,"" he said. ""It showed that we were
neither affected by the U.N. sanctions nor by the Swiss
resolution.""
 Earlier this week Paoliello said that U.N. sanctions could
affect the group's ability to source crude and that it was
monitoring the impact.
 The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Saturday on
Gaddafi and his family for his repression of a popular uprising
in which possibly thousands have been killed.
 Switzerland has not been alone in its moves against Gaddafi.
On Friday, Austria widened an asset freeze list to include a top
official at the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), Libya's
sovereign wealth fund.
 Britain also extended a freeze on Gaddafi family assets to a
further 20 members of his entourage and impounded around 100
million pounds of Libyan currency.
 Relations between Switzerland and Libya soured in 2008 when
Geneva police arrested a son of Gaddafi on charges -- later
dropped -- of abusing two domestic employees.
 Libya withdrew millions of dollars from Swiss banks, halted
oil exports to Switzerland and barred two Swiss businessmen
working in Libya from leaving the country.

(Recasts first paragraph, adds background)
 By Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner will make a quick trip to Germany on Tuesday
for economic talks, days ahead of a key European Union summit
about beefing up a rescue fund for debt-strapped bloc members.
 Treasury said the one-day trip was ""to discuss the global
economic outlook and progress on international financial
reform"" as well as events in Libya and Iran. The department
would not provide any further details.
 Geithner told Congress on Thursday that European growth was
trailing that of emerging-market countries and the United
States, and he said the region needed to do whatever was
necessary to help its most indebted members.
 ""It is important that European leaders continue to make
clear that they will do whatever is necessary to make sure that
the affected countries and their banks have the financing they
need to enable these programs to succeed,"" he said.
 Berlin, with Paris' backing, wants euro-zone countries to
agree to a competitiveness pact at a March 11 meeting in
Brussels in exchange for boosting the scope and capacity of an
emergency fund for bailing out countries cut off from the
markets.
 Berlin wants other members to pass legislation like its own
limiting the size of their debts before the so-called Emergency
Financial Stability Facility is expanded, an idea that some,
like debt-laden Greece, oppose.
 Financial markets are watching the EU drama closely,
particularly Germany's reluctance to pour more money into a
fund and the surprise announcement this week by the European
Central Bank that it may raise interest rates this spring. That
has heightened anxiety about Europe's ability to contribute to
the global recovery.
 Geithner estimated on Thursday that growth in Europe and
Japan this year would be only about 1.5 percent, compared with
6.5 percent in emerging-market countries and with U.S. growth
somewhere between those two ranges.
 Geithner will make stops in Frankfurt -- the home of the
European Central Bank -- as well as in Berlin where he is
expected to hold talks with his counterpart, Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble.
 There is plenty for the two finance chiefs to talk about,
including the potential impact of soaring oil prices stemming
from spreading fighting in Libya as well as unrest elsewhere in
Northern Africa and the Middle East.
 The Treasury said Geithner would discuss global efforts to
impose sanctions applying maximum pressure on the Gaddafi
government in Libya as well as a long-standing sanctions
program against Iran.
 The Obama administration has played down the potential
impact of soaring oil prices on the global recovery, saying
that production capacity is ample and that rich nations have
strategic reserves of oil they can tap if necessary.
 Geithner's visit to Germany came as a surprise. He was in
Europe only two weeks ago attending a Feb. 18-19 Group of 20
meeting in Paris with German officials among others.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - The dollar eased to a
four-month low against major currencies on Friday and looked
set to extend losses after a solid U.S. February jobs report
did little to alter expectations for Federal Reserve monetary
policy.
 The euro broke above the psychologically important $1.40
level and headed for its biggest weekly rise in six weeks. The
single currency is on course to make a run toward $1.4283 -- a
key resistance level touched last November -- after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet hinted Thursday at
an April interest rate rise.
 Nonfarm payrolls increased 192,000 in February, the U.S.
Labor Department said, topping forecasts of 185,000 jobs. The
unemployment rate dipped to 8.9 percent, the lowest since April
2009, compared with 9.0 percent in January. For details, see
[ID:nOAT004757]
 The U.S. jobs report ""is overshadowed by Trichet's very
hawkish comments"" on Thursday, said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of
Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
in New York.
 ""The focus in currency markets will remain on interest rate
differentials and that has been clearly on an upward trend in
favor of the euro,"" he said. ""So the price action at least for
the next week or two should favor upside bias for the euro.""
 While the data sent a strong signal the labor market
recovery has become self-sustaining, analysts said the number
was still close to forecasts, disappointing investors who had
hoped for an even stronger report.
 Federal Reserve officials, who next meet on March 15, will
likely welcome February's sturdy employment report, but
probably still regard the pace of job creation as too slow to
change the U.S. central bank's ultra-easy monetary policies.
 ""We are seeing some gradual improvement in the labor market
but not dramatic enough to change Fed policy,"" said Steven
Englander, head of G10 strategy at Citigroup in New York. ""The
Fed will look at this data and see no reason to change
policy.""
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of major currencies, fell as low as 76.275 <.DXY>, the
lowest since Nov. 5.

 The euro  last traded at $1.3985, up 0.2 percent
on the day, after surging as high as $1.4009 on trading
platform EBS, the strongest level since early November.
 The euro has moved sharply higher against the dollar in
recent weeks amid growing expectations the ECB will raise
interest rates before the U.S. central bank does.
 ECB rate speculation has pushed yields on two-year German
government bonds  -- the maturity most sensitive to
official rate moves -- roughly one full percentage point higher
than those of their U.S. counterparts  this week.
 The spread between the two hit its widest since January
2009.
 Gains in the euro could be limited, however, amid concerns
about debt problems in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece. A
rise in rates would increase the cost of funding for these
highly-indebted economies.
 Euro zone leaders will meet on March 11 to hammer out a
comprehensive package of measures against the bloc's debt
crisis, before signing off on any deal on March 24-25.
 ""The sovereign debt issue has been dormant but is is not
dead. it will likely move back to the forefront at the upcoming
summits this month,"" Englander said.
 The dollar  slipped 0.1 percent to 82.32 yen,
retreating after earlier rising as high as 83.09 yen on EBS
immediately after the release of the payrolls report.

 NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - World stocks and the U.S.
dollar dropped on Friday as oil prices rose on escalating
tensions in Libya, offsetting a U.S. jobs report that
reinforced views the economic recovery is becoming
self-sustaining.
 Gold advanced above $1,430 an ounce and U.S. Treasury debt
prices gained as the Libyan turmoil drove investors to seek
safe-haven assets.
 U.S. crude oil prices jumped to their highest since
September 2008, and Brent crude rose above $116 as Libyan
security forces clashed with rebels near the major oil terminal
of Ras Lanuf.

stocks fell a day after posting their best one-day rise in
three months.
 ""The rise in oil is a concern,"" said Kim Caughey Forrest,
senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in
Pittsburgh. ""Businesses will absorb it or pass it along, and if
they do, eventually the consumer has to pay more.""
 The U.S. government's monthly payrolls report showed strong
jobs growth in February, but with the market having rallied on
Thursday on expectations of solid hiring by private employers
the data had a muted impact.
 The Labor Department reported hiring by U.S. employers in
February hit the highest level since last May, and the
unemployment rate fell to 8.9 percent, an almost two-year low.

 * Brazilian annual inflation rate highest since Nov 2008
 * Central bankers in tight spot given FX strength
 By Jason Lange and Brad Haynes
 MEXICO CITY/SANTIAGO, March 4 (Reuters) - Mexican and
Chilean central bankers warned of rising inflation risks on
Friday while the annual pace of price increases in Brazil
neared the upper limit of the government's target range.
 The comments and data reinforced expectations of interest
rate hikes in the region and underlined the challenges facing
Latin American policymakers, who want to fight inflation
without fueling further hurtful gains in their currencies.
 ""They are caught in a corner here,"" said Enrique Alvarez,
an economist at IDEAglobal in New York.
 Chile's central bank president said policymakers must
attack inflation to mitigate risks from higher oil and food
prices.
 ""Not attacking inflationary pressures could affect
credibility,"" Jose De Gregorio said in a speech in Paris. For
more, see: [ID:nN04154164]
 His comments contrasted with minutes from the central
bank's February rate-setting meeting released earlier on
Friday, in which some board members cautioned against
""overreacting"" to rising inflationary expectations.
Nonetheless, De Gregorio's view was seen as a signal the bank
could opt for steeper interest rate hikes in the future.
 Boosted by strong demand for its exports, Latin America has
bounced back from the global recession and, with Asian
powerhouses like China and India, is helping drive global
economic growth.
 Chile and Brazil are among a slew of emerging market
countries that tightened monetary policy this year to fight
inflation fueled by higher global prices for food and
commodities. The rate hikes, however, have led currencies to
appreciate despite aggressive measures by policymakers to
contain them and the stronger currencies are hurting exports.

 CURRENCY WARNING
 Mexico's central bank also warned about inflation, although
it left interest rates steady on Friday, as widely expected.
[ID:nN04177491]
 Sounding a new alarm about risks to inflation, Mexico
warned about the risk of a sudden fall in the value of its
currency. Policymakers said they worry uprisings in the Middle
East and Africa could hit the peso, which would boost consumer
prices by making imports more expensive. Bad local weather,
which has hit corn and vegetable crops, is also a risk to
Mexican inflation, it said.
 ""All of these factors hurt the balance of risks for
inflation,"" the policy board said, adding that it nonetheless
was not altering its inflation forecast.
 In Brazil, the monthly pace of price increases inched down
in February but an annual reading rose to above 6 percent, the
highest since November 2008. That is painfully close to the 6.5
percent upper bound of the government's target range.
 The lack of major surprises in the February price data,
however, may allow the central bank to raise rates by another
50 basis points, rather than a bigger increase, at its next
meeting on April 19-20. [ID:nN04261260]
 Easy money policies in the United States and an
artificially weak Chinese currency have put the region in a
bind, economists say.
 On the one hand, policymakers like Mexican central bank
chief Agustin Carstens say money printed by the U.S. Federal
Reserve is helping boost commodities prices, which is fueling
inflation through higher food and energy costs.
 On the other hand, raising interest rates to fight
inflation attracts the money minted by the Fed, pushing
exchange rates up and hurting exports.

 * Impact will be contained if hikes are gradual, modest
 * Property risk for banks if mortgage arrears rise
 
 By Noah Barkin, Carmel Crimmins and Nigel Davies
 BERLIN/DUBLIN/MADRID, March 4 (Reuters) - Vulnerable euro
zone countries may be able to digest a series of modest interest
rate hikes without major pain, but more aggressive tightening
would hit consumers and banks, putting ambitious budget goals at
risk.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
surprised markets on Thursday by signalling a rise in the bank's
benchmark rate, currently a record low 1.0 percent, as early as
next month to counter rising inflation in the 17-nation currency
bloc.
 He also made clear that the ECB would not be embarking on a
series of substantial rate increases. A Reuters poll on Friday
showed most economists now expect three small hikes this year,
taking the headline rate to 1.75 percent
 The countries that are most vulnerable to the tightening
cycle are Ireland, Greece and Spain -- all countries with a high
percentage of floating rate mortgages, fragile banking sectors
and sizable consolidation programmes in place.
 Removing the cushion of low mortgage rates from tens of
thousands of Irish homeowners, for example, could tip many into
arrears, creating a new black hole for banks already pushed to
the brink by eye-popping losses on commercial property loans.
 ""Ireland simply cannot handle an increased interest rate
burden,"" said Ray Kinsella, a professor of banking and financial
services at University College, Dublin. ""What a rate rise does
is it opens up a second front in Ireland's banking crisis.""
 Data this week from the Irish central bank showed the number
of residential mortgages in arrears had jumped by over half in
2010 and that one in 10 mortgages was either in arrears or
restructured due to financial distress.
 Around 80 percent of Irish residential mortgages are on
variable interest rates and 50 percent track the ECB rate. Many
of those loans were signed at the peak of Ireland's property
boom, meaning holders are among the least able to absorb future
increases.
 
 IMPACT ON INVESTMENT, COMPETITIVENESS
 In Spain, almost nine out of 10 mortgages are tied to the
12-month Euribor rate, which had risen over 25 basis points this
year even before Trichet's hawkish news conference, adding 250
euros to the annual cost of servicing a 100,000 euro loan.
 But Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg Bank,
played down the impact of modest rate hikes on the Spanish
economy, estimating the annual impact of a 50 basis point hike
at 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP).
 ""We're not talking about anything dramatic,"" he said,
predicting that a pickup in global growth would fully offset the
economic impact of a series of small rate increases.
 ""If the ECB were to overreact however, say go to 2.5
percent, then the impact would be felt. It could lop off half a
point of Spanish growth.""
 An ECB working paper dating back to 2001 estimates a rate
increase of 100 basis points sustained over a two-year time
period would leave GDP in the broader euro zone one percentage
point lower than its ""steady state"" value after three years.
 It describes the negative impact on GDP as ""lagged and
gradual"", citing the depressing effect of higher rates on
investment and competitiveness, based on an initial appreciation
in the nominal exchange rate.
 The euro pushed up to a four-month high against the dollar
after Trichet's news conference on Thursday and some economists
predict it will rise further in the months ahead if the U.S.
Federal Reserve keeps its rates at a record low through 2011.
 That could hamper the ability of export-driven countries
like Ireland, which is highly exposed to U.S. demand, to rebound
at a time when domestic demand is depressed by steep wage and
pension cuts.
 
 HIGHER FUNDING COSTS
 In Greece, an increase in euro zone rates will translate
into higher funding costs for banks which have grown dependent
on the ECB for liquidity after losing access to interbank
funding because of the country's sovereign debt crisis.
 ECB funding to Greek banks has risen to 95 billion euros, or
about 19 percent of the banking system's total assets. A
quarter-point rate increase by the ECB would mean 237 million
euros of additional interest expense for Greek lenders.
 Analysts say the hit on their net interest income (NII) can
be partly mitigated by asset-side re-pricing. But given that a
large share of loans are floaters, higher borrowing rates could
have a negative effect on non-performing credit, which is rising
as the economy enters its third straight year of recession.
 ""There is bound to be an impact, especially now that
household budgets are stressed and every euro counts,"" said the
head of credit at a large Greek bank who requested anonymity.
 In Portugal, the country that is most at risk of a euro zone
bailout following the rescues of Greece and Ireland last year,
economists said a series of small rate increases could crimp
exports and weigh on consumers whose debt levels are high, but
would be tolerable.
 The impact on Italy will be mitigated by low private sector
debt levels.
 ""I don't think you'll find anyone who would cut their
forecasts for Italian growth this year or next on the basis of
the more aggressive rate hikes expected from the ECB,"" said
Unicredit economist Marco Valli. ""A potential oil shock is a far

 * Protest delayed loading of about 20 grains ships
(Recasts with protest lifted)
 By Maximiliano Rizzi and Nicolas Misculin
 BUENOS AIRES, March 4 (Reuters) - Argentine dock workers
reached a wage deal on Friday and called off a three-day-old
protest that paralyzed two major soy export terminals and
stopped 20 grains ships from loading, a union leader said.
 The blockade by members of a dock workers' cooperative
gridlocked two crushing plants and export terminals in the
Rosario agricultural hub, one of the world's largest and the
main exit point for Argentine soy.
 ""Today we're pleased because we've reached a deal and the
protest measures are being lifted in Terminal 6 and Cargill,""
Herme Juarez, head of the dock workers' cooperative, told
Reuters.
 He declined to give further details of the agreement
recahed with the companies.
 The blockade by members of Juarez's cooperative targeted a
terminal north of the city of Rosario shared by Bunge 
and Argentina's AGD, and at another nearby facility operated by
Cargill [CARG.UL].
 The two terminals account for about 16 percent of the South
American country's soyoil-processing capacity. Argentina is the
world's biggest supplier of soyoil and soymeal.
 Earlier on Friday, port workers suspended a brief protest
that halted shipping activity in the southern grains ports of
Quequen and Bahia Blanca, SOMU shipping workers' union
Omar Suarez told Reuters.
 He said the union wanted exporters to use a logistics
company that hires its members, but had called off the protest
following a request from the government.
 Both Bahia Blanca and Quequen are key movers of Argentine
wheat, especially since the country's 2010/11 harvest ended
last month.

 At the Chicago Board of Trade, U.S. soy futures <0#S:>
ended mixed, buoyed late in the session by concerns over the
Rosario dock workers' protest. The market had closed when the
wage deal was reached.
 Hefty wage demands -- traditionally negotiated in March and
April -- have become common in Argentina in the past five years
as annual inflation soared, hitting around 25 percent in 2010,
according to private estimates.
 Argentina is the world's No. 3 soybean exporter and a major
supplier of corn and wheat. About 80 percent of its soyoil and
meal is produced around Rosario, located 180 miles (300 km)
north of the capital Buenos Aires.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a
four-month low against major currencies in volatile trading on
Friday and looked set to extend losses after above-forecast
U.S. jobs data did little to alter expectations the Federal
Reserve would maintain its loose monetary policy.
 The euro rose above the key psychological $1.40 mark and
headed for its biggest weekly rise in six weeks. The single
currency is on course to make a run toward $1.4283, a key
resistance level reached last November, after European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet hinted Thursday at an
interest rate rise in April.
 Nonfarm payrolls increased 192,000, the U.S. Labor
Department said, topping forecasts of 185,000 jobs. The
unemployment rate dipped to 8.9 percent, the lowest since April
2009, versus 9.0 percent in January.
 Analysts said while the data sent a strong signal the labor
market recovery has become self-sustaining, the number was
close to forecasts, disappointing investors who hoped for an
even stronger report.
 ""We are seeing some gradual improvement in the labor market
but not dramatic enough to change Fed policy,"" said Steven
Englander, head of G10 strategy at Citigroup in New York. ""The
Fed will look at this data and see no reason to change
policy.""
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback versus a
basket of major currencies, fell as low as 76.275, the lowest
since Nov. 5.on the day, after jumping as high as $1.4009 on
trading platform EBS, the strongest level since early
November.
 The euro has moved sharply higher versus the dollar in
recent weeks on growing expectations the ECB will raise
interest rates before the U.S. central bank does.
 ECB rate speculation has pushed yields on two-year German
government bonds -- the maturity most sensitive to official
rate moves -- roughly one full percentage point higher than
those of their U.S. counterparts this week. The spread between
the two is now at its widest since January 2009.
 The U.S. jobs report ""is overshadowed by Trichet's very
hawkish comments yesterday,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of
Americas G10 FX Strategy at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
in New York.
 ""The focus in currency markets will remain on interest rate
differentials, and that's been clearly on an upward trend in
favor of the euro,"" he said. ""So the price action at least for
the next week or two should favor upside bias for the euro.""
 The dollar was last little changed at 82.35 yen after
hitting a session peak of 83.09 yen immediately after the
release of the payrolls report.
 The safe-haven Swiss franc rallied as violent clashes
intensified between loyalists to Muammar Gaddafi and rebel
forces, heightening worries that political instability in the
Middle East and North Africa could disrupt oil supplies.
 The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 0.9251 Swiss franc, while
the euro was down 0.5 percent at 1.2945 francs.

by higher oil prices.

 U.S. employers hired more workers in February than in any

 But the jobs data was close to expectations and had already

805,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2011 11:00AM ET</span>",PROFILE-Romania's Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu," Position: Romanian Central Bank Governor
 Incumbent: Mugur Isarescu
 Date of birth: Aug. 1, 1949
 Term: Officially in the job since 1991, he was appointed by
parliament in October 2009 for a new 5-year term. Tenure expires
in late 2014. Eligible for reappointment.
 Key facts: One of the world's longest-serving central
bankers, Isarescu has gained a reputation for steady
policymaking and a pro-reform stance that helped the country
join the European Union in 2007.
 The economist, with no political affiliation, has won
western praise and respect at home for keeping the bank on a
steady course in spite of the country's rocky politics following
the 1989 anti-communist revolution.
 An economic researcher during the communist era, Isarescu
took charge at the central bank in the months following the
overthrow of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
 Officially appointed in July 1991, after the passage of laws
scrapping the state monopoly on banking, he served under both
the ex-communists who followed Ceausescu and the centrists who
ousted them six years later.
 A political crisis in a ruling coalition pushed Isarescu to
the prime minister's job in 1999-2000, when he managed to foster
an economic recovery after painful years of recession.
 Isarescu flirted with politics again in 2000 when he bid for
the presidency, but his aloof style did not go down well in a
country where personal contact and warmth are the norm.
 Isarescu is widely supported by political groupings and
praised for conducting monetary policy with a steady hand --
rare in Romania, where policymakers often fall victim to
political power struggles.
 Isarescu's response to the financial crisis which hit
Romania in 2008 also won accolades, with the International
Monetary Fund crediting him for resisting temptation to slash
interest rates aggressively, a move which hammered the forint
currency in neighbouring Hungary.
 Some economists criticised him for being slow in introducing
inflation-targeting, hurting the bank's credibility by dabbling
too much in exchange rate management and missing four out of
five inflation targets since 2005.
 The bank is widely expected to miss its inflation target
again in 2010, after the coalition government of Prime Minister
Emil Boc hiked value added tax to cap the budget gap at 6.8
percent of GDP, a target set under a 20 billion euro IMF-led
bailout.
 Isarescu is regarded as one of Romania's most reputed
vintners. He has a small vineyard in the southern Dragasani
region, where he revived cultivation of ""Cramposie"" -- a
2,000-year-old grape.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2011 11:00AM ET</span>",PROFILE-Romania's President Traian Basescu," Position: Romanian President
 Incumbent: Traian Basescu, 59
 Date of birth: Nov. 4, 1951
 Term: Directly elected, Basescu won his current mandate in
December 2009 after a previous five-year term. His tenure lasts
until the next election in late 2014 and he is not eligible for
re-election.
 Key facts: Romania's third president after the 1989
anti-communist revolution, the straight-talking former sea
captain has drawn international praise for giving support to the
Black Sea state's efforts to fight deeply rooted corruption and
for preparing Romania to join the European Union in 2007.
 A rank-and-file communist party member, a must for any
ocean-going captain in the 1980s during the rule of former
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Basescu's only claim to fame was
praise from the party newspaper in 1985 for being a good sailor.
 As a transport minister in the 1990s, he spearheaded the
privatisation of Romania's vast but rusting commercial fleet.
 Pledging to reform Romania's murky political class,
Basescu first shot to power in 2004 when he unseated veteran
communist-turned socialist President Ion Iliescu. In 2009 he
narrowly won his second mandate against leftist opponent Mircea
Geoana.
 In 2006, researchers of the country's communist-era secret
police cleared him of accusations he collaborated with the
feared Securitate. He opened the Securitate archives to the
public in 2005 and officially condemned crimes of communism a
year later.
 The centre-right campaigner against corruption has a
confrontational and abrasive style, which has contributed to a
gradual erosion of his support since the global financial crisis
hit Romania in 2008 and to the collapse of two governments
during his first mandate.
 Three-quarters of voters opposed impeaching Basescu in 2007
on opposition charges that he overstepped his authority.
 He is no stranger to scandal. He has been accused of racial
slurs and insulting journalists, as well as nepotism after his
daughter, a former tabloid favourite with a high-profile
clubbing lifestyle, rose quickly through politics to win a seat
in the European parliament.
 He became Bucharest mayor in 2000 in a landslide victory
against the Social Democrat party candidate, ex-foreign minister
Geoana. Basescu's campaign used the red pepper as a symbol -- a
staple of Romanian cooking and a warning to his rivals that he
stings.
 As mayor, he caused a stir by bulldozing thousands of
illegal kiosks and trying to rid the capital of hoards of stray
dogs, resisting criticism from Western animal rights activists.

 * EFSF and permanent crisis mechanism should not buy bonds
 * Portugal can do more on structural, labour reforms
 * Not the right time to think about Greek debt restructuring
 
 By Andreas Rinke and Terhi Kinnunen
 HELSINKI, March 4 (Reuters) - The effective lending capacity
of the euro zone's bailout fund should be increased to the full
440 billion euros, Finland's finance minister said on Friday,
even though it is not clear at this stage that any other
countries need to tap the facility.
 Speaking to Reuters in an interview, Jyrki Katainen said he
did not think either the existing fund, the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), or the permanent crisis mechanism
that will take effect from mid-2013, should be used to buy bonds
from heavily indebted countries such as Greece.
 ""It is important that the instrument is workable and we have
to be ready to make it as large as we have agreed, 440 billion
(euros),"" he said of the EFSF, which was set up last May and has
a current effective capacity of 250 billion euros.
 ""We don't need to rush on this, because if we are ready to
do whatever is needed to get 440 billion out of the fund, it
should be enough,"" he said.
 ""The main issue is that we are ready to do whatever is
needed, if the money is needed. But right now, today, it doesn't
look that obvious that there are more clients coming (to seek
assistance from the EFSF).""
 Katainen, who will host a meeting of a dozen centre-right EU
leaders on Friday to discuss the euro zone debt situation, said
he did not see room for Ireland's 85 billion euro bailout
package, agreed last November, to be renegotiated.
 Ireland is pushing to have the interest on its 40 billion
euros plus of EU loans -- an average rate of 5.8 percent --
reduced to make it easier to pay back the money it owes.
 ""There are no free lunches,"" Katainen said.
 ""Of course we have to take care that the Irish package
really works, because it is in all our interests to ensure that
Ireland will recover... Therefore we have to look at the debt
sustainability,"" he said, adding:
 ""I don't know exactly what will be the outcome, but we have
to at the same time look at the Irish sustainability development
and be very strict. We don't loosen the package.""
 If the maturity or the interest on Ireland's loans were to
be reconsidered, Katainen said other guarantees would have to be
made by Ireland, such as fiscal commitments.
 ""We have just agreed on a package on Ireland and it is very
important to stick on to what we have agreed on,"" he said.
 The finance minister, who is the leader of Finland's
centre-right Conservative party and in line to become the next
prime minister, also said Portugal could do much more to reduce
its budget deficit and reform its economy.
 ""Even though the Portuguese government has said that they
have done already a lot, if the market doesn't believe this or
if the sentiment is still nervous, they just have to do more.
 ""I know they are doing their best, but they have to put more
effort on reform, especially on structural issues, such as
labour market issues,"" he said.
 He praised Spain, saying it had shown the way on economic
reforms and convinced financial markets of its determination,
restoring confidence.
 On Greece, he said the country needed to stick to the terms
of its 110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout and not think about a
debt restructuring at this stage.
 ""I wouldn't want to speculate on debt restructuring, because
they can also do a lot by following the package we have agreed
on with the IMF, EU and Greece,"" he said.
 ""The best way to deal with the Greece crisis is to follow
very strictly the package... It is no time to start to talk
about the debt restructuring.""

 (Adds detail, comments)
 MOSCOW, March 4 (Reuters) - Some $13 billion left Russia in
capital outflows in January, RIA news agency quoted the central
bank's first deputy chairman Alexei Ulyukayev as saying on
Friday.
 Outflows of from Russia took place even as oil prices
rallied to levels of $100 per barrel [O/R], propping up the
rouble  and easing concerns about the health of the
federal finances.
 Capital has fled the country as investors hedge risks ahead
of presidential elections due in 12 months' time, Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin said earlier this week. [ID:nLDE7220XZ]
 Outflows may have been also prompted by Russia's budget
policy, which envisages increasing spending and needs higher
incomes to fill its coffers. Social security levy was raised to
34 percent from 26 percent effective from Jan. 1.
 ""There was a rapid increase in the social security tax and
capital outflow reflected business' concerns that the government
may continue increasing tax burdens,"" said Natalia Orlova, chief
economist at Alfa Bank.
 ""I do not think that capital outflows were caused by
inflation or fluctuations in the rouble exchange rate.""
 Russia expects to see modest capital inflows this year after
net $38 billion left the county in 2010.
 Speaking on the sidelines of central bankers forum in Paris,
Ulyukayev also said on Friday that in the first four days of
March the central bank purchased around $1 billion in
interventions aimed at easing upside pressure on the oil-boosted
rouble  . That compares to interventions of
around $4.5 billion in February.

 NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped versus the
euro and pared gains against the yen in volatile trading on
Friday after U.S. February jobs data came in better than
expected but disappointed investors who hoped for an even
stronger report.
 Nonfarm payrolls increased 192,000, the Labor Department
said, above market expectations for 185,000 jobs. The
unemployment rate dipped to 8.9 percent, the lowest since April
2009, versus 9.0 percent in January.
 ""Despite what appears to be a relatively healthy labor
market report, the dollar failed to hold onto its initial
gains,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT
in New York.
 ""The problem is that February was a good but not great
month for the labor market. Going into the non-farm payrolls
report, everyone expected a strong number,"" she said.
 The euro last traded at $1.3986, up 0.1 percent. It jumped
as high as $1.4002 on trading platform EBS after the jobs data,
the strongest level since early November. Traders cited an
option barrier at $1.40 and offers to sell the single currency
looming just above that point.
 The single currency is likely to remain supported, analysts
said, after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
hinted at an interest rate rise in April, bolstering the view
the ECB will tighten monetary policy before the Federal

 The dollar was last little changed at 82.41 yen, compared
with 82.83 yen before the release of the jobs data. It briefly

 * Rise due to commodity boom, not to competitiveness gains
 * Needs more high tech exports to catch up with EU partners
 
 By Harry Papachristou
 ATHENS, March 4 (Reuters) - A surge in exports has given
Greece a glimmer of hope in the grim aftermath of its debt
crisis, but underlying figures show a lack of competitiveness
that is at the root of its problems is not going away.
 Exports surged 35 percent in the last quarter of 2010,
chiefly on the back of booming global commodity prices, which
drove sales of Greece's iron bars, aluminium and copper up by as
much as 75 percent in the January to November period.
 That has done little to stem the overall slide in growth due
to public sector cutbacks that are Athens' contribution to last
year's international bailout package, but it has allowed the
government to claim it is making progress with reforms.
 ""Greece is having a veritable export explosion,"" Prime
Minister George Papandreou said last month. ""This is due to
continuous structural reform and the sacrifices the Greek people
made last year.""
 Analysts, however, say the commodities boom only masks the
country's lack of successful manufacturing and services sectors
that can compete for market share in the world's fastest-growing
emerging markets.
 ""The exports surge is nothing revolutionary, Greece is
benefiting from the commodities cycle,"" said Nikos Magginas, an
analyst at the National Bank of Greece.
 The conclusion of most is that Greece faces the harsh
reality of simply having to reduce wages at home to make
business more competitive in the short term -- and there is as
yet little sign of that happening.
 
 ONLY PRICES RISING
 With years of EU- and IMF-imposed austerity still ahead,
export performance will be key to whether Greece can create
enough economic growth to service its huge debt, expected to hit
about 160 percent of GDP after the bailout expires in 2013.
 Foreign sales of petroleum products also rose 97 percent
year-on-year in the fourth quarter, but that was also chiefly
due to higher world oil prices. 
 Exports of non-oil products, by contrast, rose just 1.9
percent, according to central bank data, and the metals sales
also hold little hope of a grand expansion.
 ""Metal sales are rising but there is no significant increase
in volumes,"" said Victor Labate, an analyst at National
Securities.
 The export performance also pales next to that of its EU
partners. Total EU exports rose at an annual pace of 18 percent
in January to November of last year, according to Eurostat
figures, three times faster than Greece's.
 ""Greece is benefiting less from the strength of global
demand,"" said Ben May of Capital Economics. ""Greek firms' export
orders remain far weaker than the equivalent euro zone index.""
 The boom has lifted the shares of metals firms and refiners
such as Viohalco  and Hellenic Petroleum ,
which have outperformed the Athens benchmark index <.ATG>. But
it did not stop GDP from shrinking at a record annual pace of
6.6 percent in Q4, its fastest decline since the 1970s.
 
 NO WAGE CUTS
 Private sector wages were frozen last year and they may need
to fall to boost exports' competitiveness in the short term.
 This was the model adopted by EU members Latvia and
Lithuania to get their economies going again without devaluing
their currencies and Greece is similarly locked into the euro.
 But Greece is a much bigger economy with years of relative
prosperity behind it and policymakers and the public reject the
idea that wage cuts will solve the problem.
 ""We can't compete on the logic of granting Chinese or Indian
salaries,"" Papandreou, who has axed civil servants' pay to slash
the country's budget gap, said last month.
 Irking the EU and the IMF, Papandreou's Socialist government
has watered down a law which would theoretically allow companies
to cut wages over the objections of labour unions.
 Neogal, a small dairy producer which was the first to try to
apply the law, quickly gave up after being confronted with a
wave of bad press and consumers' protests.
 About two thirds of Greek exports are low-tech, low-profit
wares such as foodstuffs and building materials, compared with
just one third in the euro area. This needs to change and the
government is using EU funds to subsidize research.
 The small size of Greek companies -- about 85 percent of
them employ less than 10 people -- leaves them struggling to
make inroads into the roaring but distant markets of China and
India. Goods sold there account for just 1.2 percent of the
total, offering little hope for any quick gains.
 Greek exports of manufactured goods account for about 10
percent of GDP, according to central bank figures. Unless this
gets closer to the euro zone average of about 30 percent, any
hopes for an export-led recovery are remote.
 ""The currently small size of exports implies that very
dynamic growth rates will be necessary for this demand component
to pull the whole economy back to growth,"" said the European
Commission in a report last month.
 Despite an estimated export rise of 5 percent in 2011, the
Commission expects the Greek economy to shrink by about 3
percent this year, its third consecutive year of recession.
Analysts say that if Greece bets on a turnaround in 2011, it
would do better to rely on more traditional foreign currency
earners, such as tourism and shipping. They too would benefit
from lower wages and lower prices. 
 ""These remain the best hopes for a recovery,"" said National
Bank's Magginas.

 Non-farm payrolls increased by 192,000, the U.S. Labor
Department said, above market expectations for 185,000 jobs.
Data for December and January was revised to show 58,000 more
jobs created than previously estimated.
 But a lot of the increase was already priced into markets so
after an early jump, stocks fell back. Investors also said
February's numbers were exaggerated by the hit to January
figures from bad weather.
The euro remained buoyant against the dollar, following the
European Central Bank's steer on Thursday towards a rate hike as
early as next month. The euro was at $1.3960.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.2 percent, off
their highs, and the FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.1 percent.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - The euro hit a four-month high
against the dollar on Friday on expectations euro zone interest
rates may rise next month, while investors waited to see whether
strong U.S. jobs data would offer the greenback some respite.
 The central forecast in a Reuters poll was for 185,000 new
jobs to have been added to the economy last month, after an
addition of 36,000 in January.  
 With the euro hovering just shy of $1.40, analysts looked to
movements in U.S. yields to drive the dollar after the jobs
data, due at 1330 GMT. 
 ""We should see a better non-farm payrolls figure, but if
U.S. yields don't rise, it won't help the dollar,"" said Marcus
Hettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 ""Interest rate differentials ... are playing in favour for
the euro, so we could see a break above $1.40 any time now.""
 The euro stayed well bid after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet stunned investors on Thursday by
saying a rate rise in April was a possibility. [ID:nLDE7220KJ]
 The euro  edged up to $1.3978 on trading platform EBS,
its strongest level since early November. Gains were capped,
however, with traders citing a barrier at $1.40 and offers to
sell the single currency looming just above there.
 Analysts said the euro was poised for a move higher, though,
as the ECB's announcement, which fortified the view the ECB will
raise rates well before the Federal Reserve, had widened the gap
between euro zone and U.S. government bond yields.
 At the same time, Paul Robinson, head of European FX
Research at Barclays Capital, said dollar risks were skewed to
the downside heading into payrolls and that the U.S. currency
could face more selling than usual if the figure comes in weak.
 ""What makes today's nonfarm payrolls data more interesting
is the very different views of the world held by the ECB and
Federal Reserve,"" he said. 
 ECB rate speculation has pushed yields on two-year German
government bonds  -- the maturity most sensitive to
official rate moves -- roughly a full percentage point higher
than those of their U.S. counterparts  this week. The
spread between the two is now at its widest since January 2009.
 Euro interest rate swaps soared across the curve with the
two-year rate  hitting around 2.33 percent, highs
not seen since early 2009.
 While rate speculation has boosted the euro, some analysts
pointed out the dangers of tightening policy when some euro zone
economies are suffering because of debt problems.
 The euro had support above its 200-week moving average
around $1.3957, and a weekly close above that would pave the way
for a move higher. Near-term resistance was seen around $1.3980,
however, the 78.6 percent retracement of the euro's down-move
from November.
 The euro also hit a five-month high against the yen
 of 115.55 yen, according to Reuters data.

 BUY ON DIPS
 Market participants acknowledged the euro may stumble if
European officials fail to reach a consensus on a lasting
solution to euro zone debt problems when they meet this month.
 But some forex managers said they would be happy to pick up
the single currency if it dips on such concerns, as they were
confident political differences within the region were unlikely
to derail overall stability.
 ""We like the euro,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency
management at Investec, arguing that even the economies of some
weaker euro zone countries were starting to improve, while
Europe would eventually hammer out a permanent debt rescue plan.
 He added: ""We would be interested in increasing our euro
positions more on any correction to $1.34-35.""
 But the shared currency  slipped 0.3 percent on
the day to 1.2967 Swiss francs, which rallied after Swiss
National Bank Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan said rates in the
country will have to rise in the medium term. [ID:nWEB3522]
 The dollar  was up 0.3 percent at 82.69 yen, but was
at 76.493 against a currency basket <.DXY>, little changed on
the day and hovering near a four-month low hit on Thursday.

* States could divest equity sales, open up markets 
* Investors eye financial services, tourism sectors 
 
 By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Unnerving as it is, the tide of
political change sweeping the Arab world may also end up drawing
in a fresh wave of foreign capital for the region.
 As entrenched monopolies and patronage give way in the
Middle East and North Africa, governments in the region could
open their markets further and divest some state assets.
 Wealthy Gulf states such Kuwait and Qatar have little cause
to sell, but post-revolutionary states in the region such as
Tunisia will likely lower protectionist barriers as they seek to
accelerate income redistribution for their restive citizenry.
 The triumph of free market-oriented democracy is far from
certain however. After decades of autocratic rule, political
parties are only just reforming in Egypt and Tunisia while an
uprising in Libya is proving bloody and protracted.
 But greater access to markets in an oil-rich region with a
youthful population is a tantalising prospect for investors.
 ""It's too early to work out how these revolutions will pan
out. But this crisis is going to reveal some opportunities as
structures linked to old regimes will be unwound,"" said Julian
Mayo, investment director at Charlemagne Capital.
 Large-scale privatisation will be off the agenda, with the
oil and gas sector especially taboo. Instead, sectors such as
financial services, telecoms and tourism could be liberalised.
 ""Foreign investment has been high in the region but what was
lacking was conviction that change was happening fast enough.
Market liquidity was low as stocks were tightly held,"" said Luca
de Conte, Director Capital Markets at GMP Europe.
 Cashing in on state-held equity in publicly traded companies
is an obvious way to boost foreign investment.
 Thomson Reuters Ownership data show regional governments
holding stakes worth $320 billion in publicly traded firms,
either directly or through rulers and sovereign funds.
 The figures exclude Tunisia, where many companies were
privately held by the extended family of former President Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali.
 
 UNTANGLING TIES
 Tunisia's interim government have said these assets, which
include firms in key sectors such as mining and tourism,
will be recovered.
 Many are likely by disposed through direct sales or stock
market listings, said Tunis-based broker Issam Ayari.
 ""The government isn't keen on nationalisation. Transparency
will be important as well as gaining technical expertise.""
 To tackle unemployment, the next government will also want
to redouble efforts to attract foreign investment, which
contributed to a mere 6 percent of Tunisia's gross domestic
product in 2008 before the onset of the financial crisis.
 Foreign investors in the region have had a mixed reception.
 High profile successes include Toronto-based PotashCorp's
2003 purchase of a 28-percent stake in Arab Potash Co, which is
still majority owned by the Jordanian ruler.
 On the other extreme end is Algeria, where the economy
remains dominated by the state. A local mobile phone unit is
being nationalised after a tax dispute between its Egyptian
owner Orascom Telecom and the government.
 Egypt has been one of North Africa's more open economies.
 But even there, it remains to be seen if the army -- the
only pillar of the establishment to survive the popular revolt
against President Hosni Mubarak -- will willingly relinquish
control of a swathe of businesses that range from olive-oil
production to vehicle manufacturing.
 ""Prospects of these firms being privatised are very low as
they are huge money-makers for the military,"" notes Byran
Plamondon, senior MENA economist at IHS Global Insight.
 
 LIBYAN PROMISE
 For incoming leaders, maintaining social cohesion while
attracting foreign investment will be a careful balancing act.
 State-owned Tunisie Telecom last month cancelled plans for a
joint listing on the Paris and Tunis stock exchanges amid the
threat of industrial action by the company's workers.
 ""State-owned companies are an important source of
employment. Privatisations and other economic reforms often
involve laying off people,"" said Okan Akin, an RBS strategist.
 Ironically, Libya -- scene of the most violent of the
regional upheavals so far -- is also seen as the most promising.
 Until recent disruptions, it was the world's 12th largest
oil exporter. Analysts say its economy could take off if
stability returns without substantial damage to the oil and gas
infrastructure that generates the bulk of national revenues.
 ""The economy is not as advanced as the rest of North Africa,
so from an investment standpoint, it could be the most
attractive due to the low-base effect,"" said David Damiba, who
heads Renaissance Asset Management's Africa investment team.
 Libya attracted strong investor interest when decades of
Western sanctions were lifted in 2004. 
 France's BNP Paribas took a minority stake in a local bank
when banking rules were eased and investors still see potential
in the banking and insurance sector.
 ""When you have an economy moving from socialist dictatorship
to full-fledged free market, the spider in the web of that
transformation will be the banks,"" said Bjorn Englund, who runs
an investment fund focused on Iraq.

 * Economy recovering from 14 percent fall in 2009
 * Estonia joined euro zone in January
 
 By David Mardiste
 TALLINN, March 4 (Reuters) - Estonia's centre-right
coalition has a good chance of being re-elected on Sunday.
keeping the new euro zone member on a path of fiscal
conservatism in the debt-ridden single currency area.
 An opinion poll on Thursday showed the Reform Party of Prime
Minister Andrus Ansip and its partner Pro Patria and Res
Republica Union would win a combined 54 percent of the vote,
which would give them a majority in the 101-seat parliament.
 A poll on Tuesday was less clear-cut, showing Ansip may need
to negotiate with a third party, possibly the centre-left Social
Democrats, to secure a majority.
 However, political analysts believe the country of 1.3
million people will stick to its policies of keeping a tight
rein on finances, which allowed it in January to become the 17th
country to adopt the euro, with the lowest debt burden in the
European Union.
 ""As indicated by several polls our base-line scenario is for
a similar coalition to the existing one, so we are not expecting
any significant changes to political or economic policy,"" said
Annika Lindblad, emerging market analyst at Nordea Bank.
 The Centre Party, the main opposition grouping, has been
hit by allegations it asked for funding from Russia, Estonia's
huge neighbour which is traditionally regarded with distrust.
The party has denied the allegations.
 The Social Democrats entered the government with Ansip after
the last election in 2007, but that coalition split.
 
 DROP IN OUTPUT
 Ansip's government was in a minority for a while, but
defections from smaller parties eventually gave it 51 seats.
 Thursday's opinion poll, carried out by TNS Emor and
reported in the media, gave Ansip's Reform Party 29 percent
support and Pro Patria/Res Publica 25 percent.
 A Turu-uuringute poll commissioned by the newspaper
Postimees and issued on Tuesday, gave the ruling coalition 35
percent backing, leaving it needing support elsewhere for a
majority, which could come from the Social Democrats.
 Estonia suffered a drop of 14 percent in economic output
during the 2009 recession, the third worst in the EU after
fellow Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania.
 The government had to cut spending to keep its budget
deficit within euro-zone limits to adopt the currency.
 Estonia remains one of the poorest countries in the EU,
which it entered in 2004, the same year it joined NATO.
 Its fiscal shape is sound -- the European Commission has
forecast a total public sector budget deficit of 1.6 percent of
output for 2011, in line with the euro area average.
 State debt, forecast at 9.5 percent of output for this year,
will be by far the lowest in the euro zone and well below the
average 86.5 percent of gross domestic product. The government
has pledged to get the budget back in balance by 2014.
 Estonians can vote via the Internet until March 2 and then
on election day at polling stations between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
(0700 and 1800 GMT).

 * Draghi says imbalances will be around a long time
 * Bini Smaghi says world has underestimated inflation
 * China says reserve currency nations have huge impact

(Adds Chinese and French officials)
 By Daniel Flynn and Marc Jones
 PARIS, March 4 (Reuters) - ECB policymakers warned global
central bankers on Friday that economic imbalances could worsen
fast unless the G20 makes a concerted push to tackle them.
 Axel Weber, soon to quit as head of Germany's Bundesbank,
told a meeting of U.S., euro zone and Asian policymakers that
IMF forecasts pointed to renewed divergences in current account
positions and that the surge in oil prices since unrest broke
out across North Africa would accelerate this.
 ECB governing council member Mario Draghi added that global
mismatches would remain a problem for long time to come.
 Imbalances between wealthy and emerging nations are proving
one of the biggest headaches for policymakers striving to repair
the world economy after the most damaging crisis in decades and
reduce the risks of future shocks.
 ""Current account surpluses have returned or are currently
returning to pre-crisis levels and I think this will be sped up
by the fact that the recent hike in oil prices might
accelerate,"" Weber said.
 Draghi told the meeting: ""These imbalances will stay with us
for a long, long time.
 ""What we need then is to make sure that capital markets
function to finance these imbalances ... because we know they
are not exactly efficient, so we need rules, we need a resilient
financial system.""
 Weber also said currencies in many emerging economies
remained undervalued and urged the United States to save more to
curb its reliance on foreign capital.
 They were addressing a dozen global policymakers who joined
academics and businessmen under the banner of France's Group of
20 presidency to discuss imbalances, regulation, inflation and
other topics two weeks after G20 finance ministers fixed a set
of indicators to measure imbalances.
 ""We are not trying to find the perfect financial system,""
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said.
""We want better coordination of economic policies. We want
to reduce the need to accumulate international reserves. We need
to get to the roots of why emerging markets feel the need to
accumulate reserves,"" she said.
 ""We need to work better on the financial safety net, we need
to do a good job, they need to be easy to use and not associated
with the IMF stigma.""
 The finance ministers of the world's major economies
succeeded only in reaching a fudged accord on how to measure
global imbalances after China prevented the use of exchange
rates and currency reserves as indicators.
 ""The G20 is the only group that basically has legitimacy to
own this process (of tackling imbalances) and drive forward and
achieve results,"" Weber said.
 ""We have to start passing a judgment on what the
disequilibrium is. We have to embark on mechanisms to deal with
these current account problems and come up with a surveillance
process to make sure countries that commit to certain processes
at the national level see these policies through.""
 
 REGULATION, INFLATION HOT TOPICS
 Friday's gathering came a day after the European Central
Bank said it could soon raise interest rates, heightening
concerns about the implications for struggling euro zone
countries as EU leaders strive to resolve the debt crisis.
 ECB board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the world had a
tendency to systematically underestimate inflation and
overestimate growth in developed economies.
 ""If we look at the past at the kind of forecast errors which
have been done and here I look at the IMF forecast errors ... we
have systematically underestimated inflation and overestimated
growth in advanced economies,"" he said.
 China and other Asian and Latin American economies are
resisting pressure from Washington and Europe to raise their
interest rates to curb signs of overheating in their economies
and allow their currencies to appreciate.
 Many of them point the finger squarely at the U.S. Federal
Reserve's new round of money printing via a $600 billion bond
purchase programme as the root cause behind a wave of ""hot
money"" inflows that risk destabilising their economies.
 ""Policies of major reserve issuing currencies have an
enormous impact on other countries,"" Chinese deputy central bank
governor Hu Xiaolian said.
 Opening Friday's conference, Bank of France Governor and ECB
governing council member Christian Noyer said the accumulation
of foreign reserves by emerging economies was part of the reason
behind the globalised crisis. 
 He also told policymakers that the G20 still had significant
room to press ahead with financial regulation, particularly on
the structure of commodities markets and tighter regulation of
the ""shadow banking system"".

 LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Investors face a key stress test
in the coming week as the Middle Eastern political crisis,
rising oil prices and expectations for higher interest rates
slow the ascent of world stocks near their 30-month highs.
 A rally in world stocks, measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>,
stalled just near their peak of mid-February as oil prices raced
to 2-1/2 year highs in the face of escalating violence in Libya
and other Arab countries.
 However, in a sign of resilience, the MSCI index bounced 1.4
percent in the past week as investors focused on improving
corporate and economic fundamentals, with world growth still
expected at a reasonable rate of 4 percent this year.
 Data from Thomson Reuters Lipper showed investors put $2.3
billion of fresh cash into U.S. equity funds in the week ended
March 2, although they did pull out money from emerging markets.
 Oil will hold key for investors in the coming week, which
will see Saudi Arabia's planned protest and a key summit of
European leaders on Libya and the sovereign debt crisis.
 According to Reuters data, 30-day rolling correlations of
the MSCI world stock index and U.S. crude oil hit -0.4 percent,
levels last seen in early 2008. This means stocks fall when oil
rises and the link is strongest in three years.
 ""Markets have been spooked by fear that we may be in for a
1970s style oil shock. Oil price worries are keeping markets
from rallying further,"" said Lothar Mentel, chief investment
officer at Octopus Investments.
 ""There isn't too much new bad news from trouble spots, and
good macroeconomic news can dominate the market but that can
change very quickly. I wouldn't put my money in the sustained
rally next week.""
 Oil prices and the Volatility Index <.VIX> -- Wall Street's
so-called fear gauge -- have also started to move in tandem in
the past few weeks.
 Saudi Arabia's stock markets <.TASI>, largely dominated by
domestic investors, plunged to fresh 22-month lows on Wednesday
before its weekend as concerns intensified ahead of planned
protests in the top oil exporter on March 11 and 20.
 Dubai <.DFMGI>and Kuwait <.KWSE> shares hit 6-year lows on
Thursday.

---------------------------------------------------------------
 
 REASONS FOR RESILIENCE
 Investor resilience stems from their confidence that the
world economy, backed by cheap and abundant cash, will stage a
strong recovery this year.
 Reuters calculations show world GDP growth will halve to 2.1
percent in 2011 from current projections only if Brent crude oil
 reached $150 a barrel, a 30 percent increase from
Friday's prices.
 Oil will have to reach as high as $191 to wipe out world
growth, based on assumption that a $10 percent rise in oil
prices trims global growth by around 0.5 percent.
 And the corporate sector remains healthy. S&P 500 companies
<.SPX> expanded their earnings by nearly 37 percent in the
fourth quarter, while Q1 earnings are expected at 13.3 percent.
 Thomson Reuters data showed private equity-backed M&A
activity rose 88 percent on the year to $36.3 billion for
year-to-date 2011, marking the strongest annual start for
leveraged buyouts since 2008.
 German private bank Berenberg says surprises from oil prices
and upbeat growth will lead to higher nominal interest rates.
 ""The two surprises roughly offset each other in their impact
on global economic growth. But they do point to less subdued
inflation and somewhat higher nominal interest rates,"" its chief
economist Holger Schmieding said in a note to clients.
 Expectations for higher interest rates grew after the
European Central Bank warned on Thursday it could soon raise the
cost of borrowing. This has sent the interest rate-sensitive
two-year German government bond yield to a 20-month high of
1.783 percent .
 The ECB's hawkish stance is raising concerns about the
implications for struggling euro zone countries, ahead of a key
European Union summit on March 11 where leaders discuss a full
package of measures to tackle the sovereign debt crisis.
 A failure to agree in principle on measures is likely to
trigger a sell-off in peripheral government bonds.
 ""We are not yet willing to bet on solidarity succeeding. In
particular, Spain, Portugal and Belgium have large amounts of
debt to refinance in March, April and May and this will be a key
test of confidence in these countries,"" Dirk Wiedmann, chief
investment officer at Rothschild Private Banking & Trust, noted.
 ""Uncertainty is still as high as ever and we remain
cautious. We have low allocations to eurozone bonds, with a
focus on higher-quality and short-duration securities.""
 Finally, investors may keep an eye on signs of a change in
trend in a month which proved a turning point for three of the
past 7 years. Most recently in 2009, world stocks rallied 74
percent after hitting a cycle low in mid-March.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2011 06:32AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Russia must resist oil lure to control inflation," * Higher oil prices mean extra $50 bln for budget
 * Govt must work with cbank to keep single digit inflation
 * Putin already promising more cash
 
 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, March 4 (Reuters) - Russia is basking in the glow of
high oil prices, tempting politicians to spend more ahead of
elections, but only the unpopular move of keeping a tight grip
on the budget can cure voters' biggest worry -- high inflation.
 This poses a tough challenge for Alexei Kudrin, a 10-year
veteran at the helm of the Finance Ministry whose prudent
policies helped see Russia through the last economic crisis but
won him many enemies amongst politicians who would rather lure
voters with low taxes and high spending.
 Already, powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has delayed
the decision on Russia's long-term economic strategy until after
the election, putting off tough decisions on whether to curb the
budget deficit or stimulate domestic industry.
 Since the start of the year, Russia's Urals oil export blend
has averaged $98 a barrel, 30 percent higher than planned
in the budget. If that continues for the rest of the year, the
state could earn an extra 1.5 trillion roubles ($53 billion).
 On the surface, that sounds like good news for the world's
biggest producer, where the Economy Ministry estimates that each
$10 increase in the price of oil translates into 0.5 percentage
points of additional economic growth.
 But, in a turnaround from recession-hit 2009, inflation has
once again overtaken unemployment as Russians' top concern,
worrying nearly two-thirds of the population according to
independent pollsters Levada. And for fighting inflation, the
mix of high oil prices and upcoming elections, is bad news.
 Although inflation is a global problem, prices in Russia are
rising faster than in any of its BRIC emerging market peers, and
almost twice as fast as in China.
 As an oil producer, Russia is less exposed than crude
consumers to the direct shocks from energy prices. For it, the
inflationary risk from oil comes instead from the extra cash
that floods into the economy as it earns more from exports.
 ""Coordination of fiscal and monetary policy will be
critical. To the extent that both policies are pushing in the
same direction, they may be able to keep a lid on inflation and
stop it from escalating into double digits,"" said Zeljko
Bogetic, lead economist for Russia at the World Bank.
 ""It will be wrong to relax the fiscal stance and go on a
spending spree, but ... there is clearly a risk of this with
high oil prices and the elections coming up.""
 
 HARD REALITY VS PROMISES
 The central bank admits that it would be very tough to keep
inflation on target, at no more than 7 percent this year after a
severe drought pushed up the 2010 reading to 8.8 percent.
 It has turned its full arsenal against inflation, raising
interest rates and reserve requirements and loosening its
control on the rouble to allow faster currency appreciation.
 The full-scale onslaught from the central bank -- even as
seasonal trends allow a fall in monthly inflation in February --
could signal that it is aware of the price pressures that may
soon emerge from pre-election pledges, said Julia Tsepliaeva,
chief economist for Russia and CIS at BNP Paribas.
 Kudrin wants to cut borrowing by 500 billion roubles and
stash away 700 billion roubles in the sovereign Reserve Fund.
 Putin has given his agreement, but at the same time he has
already started doling out promises of cash, like the pledge of
4 billion roubles of farm equipment subsidies.
 ""The contradiction is ... between the national leader's wish
to reach all the goals at the same time and the hard reality,""
economists at the Development Centre think-tank in Moscow's
influential Higher School of Economics said in a report.
 The reality, argues Kudrin, is that by spending the extra
oil cash Russia only strengthens its dependence on 'black gold'
-- the very tie it has pledged to break to avoid becoming a
hostage of commodity prices during the next global crisis.
 ""We talk a lot about how we need to get rid of our oil and
gas dependency. For now, we are not succeeding,"" Kudrin told an
economic forum in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, lamenting
his failure to persuade state monopolies to pay higher taxes or
to push through a proposed increase in the pension age.
 Oil and gas accounted for 48 percent of 2010 budget revenues
of 7.9 trillion roubles -- up from 37 percent 5 years earlier.
 Weaning Russia off this dependency by not spending the oil
cash would be a painful process and one Putin is unlikely to
risk given his popularity ratings have already started to edge
lower from near-80 percent to the still respectable low-70s.
 ""In the past, Kudrin never succeeded in containing the
budget and preventing the government from increasing spending at
such a time,"" said Tsepliaeva at BNP Paribas.
 ""Some waves of populism before elections are unavoidable and
extra budget spending ahead of the vote is always inflationary.""

 Incumbent: Andrius Kubilius
 Date of birth: Dec. 8, 1956
 Term: Appointed on Nov. 27, 2008, for the second time, after
his Homeland Union/Lithuanian Christian Democrats (HU/LCD) won a
national election and formed a coalition government with liberal
parties. The next election is due in October 2012.
 
 Key facts:
 -- Kubilius had little time to enjoy the election victory as
his government had immediately to deal with a ballooning deficit
and an economic crisis. 
 -- He led the government in 1999-2000 when Lithuania had to
deal with aftermath of the Russian crisis -- when a Russian
devaluation deprived Lithuania of its mainstay export market and
sent the economy into recession -- earning him the title of
""crisis prime minister"".
 -- For the past two years his main task has been to drive
the public sector budget deficit down, to raise capital on
international markets and to keep the national currency, the
litas, pegged to the euro.
 -- Lithuania pledged to cut its budget deficit to 3 percent
of gross domestic product by 2012 to be able to adopt the euro
in 2014.
 -- In 2012, the deficit is seen at 5.8 percent of GDP.
 The government opted for drastic wage and price cuts to
avoid a devaluation, while also rejecting calls to ask for help
from the International Monetary Fund, as neighbouring Latvia
did.
 -- His government has been also pursuing an ambitious plan
to build a new nuclear power plant by 2020 to cut energy

adopt the euro in 2014.
 -- He also brushed off criticism that the central bank

 * Parlt due to elect new Monetary Council members on Mon
 * New council seen cautious with easing -analysts

By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, March 4 (Reuters) - Hungary's government may
change the course of central bank policy for the looser with
four appointments on Monday after a year of conflict with the
bank over policies the cabinet says failed to support growth.
 After slashing central bank wages last year, the ruling
Fidesz party has first had to find candidates willing to take
the reduced wages on offer and has promised a U-turn for later
this year that will raise pay.
 But it was its move to change the rules on appointments to
the board that drew the ire of the European Union, and Fidesz is
now expected to force candidates through parliament who will
probably take a more accommodative stance.
 Given rising risks of inflation, that may not mean turning
back the 75 basis points in rate rises delivered by the bank
since November, but analysts expect rates will not be raised
again this year and could yet be cut.
 ""We do not expect the new council to start aggressively
cutting rates,"" said Matyas Kovacs, analyst at Raiffeisen.
 ""We think there will be room for a cut if the government
sticks to the deadlines laid out for structural reforms and the
outlook on Hungary's credit rating improves - then there can be
a rate cut of 25 basis points in the fourth quarter.""
 The vote in parliament fills four vacancies on the 7-member
rate-setting body, giving the new group a majority on the
7-strong body over Governor Andras Simor and his two deputies.
 The new council faces an improving economy that will add to
risks to inflation from surging fuel and food costs as well as
concerns over a still fragile forint whose weakness hurts the
many Hungarians with foreign currency loans.
 PAY CUT
 Last year Fidesz passed legislation to cap salaries at 2
million forints ($10,190) per month in the public sector,
effectively cutting Simor's salary by 75 percent, and also
cutting pay for his two deputies.
 The cut, however, also brought a reduction in rate setters'
salaries which are set at 35 percent of the governor's salary,
reducing the job's appeal and a website reported this week the
government was struggling to find candidates. 
 A spokeswoman for Fidesz MP Antal Rogan confirmed to Reuters
on Wednesday that the government was planning to raise the
salaries again.
 The changes in the central bank law stripped Simor of the
power to appoint two members of the council, giving them to
parliament instead and European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet warned on Thursday that could lead to legal
action by the EU.
 But despite all the friction, Prime Minister Viktor Orban
has also said the country must work towards lowering inflation
and that a reshuffling of the Council would not lead to radical
changes in central bank policy.
 He said monetary policy belonged to the world of ""slow
sports"" and calmness was the most important thing, while a
predictable form of cooperation was needed between the Monetary
Council and the government.
 Simor has also said he would remain on the council for his
full term, which runs until 2013.
 
 REFORMS CRUCIAL
 A Reuters poll of analysts earlier this year showed that the
revamped Council with members chosen by Fidesz could be more
open to using stimulus measures to support the government's
unorthodox pro-growth policy.
 Hungary's government embarked on an unconventional policy
track last year to boost growth and keep the budget in check.
 Earlier this week it launched a package of fiscal measures,
which it said would improve the budget balance by 900 billion
Hungarian forints by 2013, when crisis taxes imposed on certain
business sectors expire.
 Analysts welcomed the measures - which include tightening
rules on early retirement and disability pensions, and cuts in
drug subsidies - but said the government would need to show a
strong political will to implement the fiscal cuts in full.
 This could lower risk premia on Hungarian assets, and
increase room for monetary easing, they said.

 * Mall a sign of booming UAE-China trade relations
 
 By Martina Fuchs
 DUBAI, March 4 (Reuters) - A behemoth dragon-shaped shopping
mall in the desert near Dubai has become a symbol of the
deepening links between East Asia and the Middle East.
 Dragon Mart -- 3,950 wholesale and retail shops, stretching
1.2 km, or about three-quarters of a mile, in a sinuous strip
alongside a desert highway -- is China's trade outpost in the
Gulf, selling everything from marble tiles and artificial hair
extensions to dried fish and Mickey Mouse telephones.
 ""I come here with my wife and four children every second
week, it's much cheaper and it is a great shopping experience,""
Souhail al-Zaabi, a policeman from Ras al-Khaimah, said
recently. ""Today, we are buying a chandelier for our majlis,"" he
added, referring to the traditional Arab sitting room, ""not too
big, but like crystals it must look"".
 Farther along the mall, Chinese massage machines were
selling briskly.
 ""I have already bought three tools,"" said Ali Abdulkader, a
65-year-old customer, also from Ras al-Khaimah, shopping at a
Body Care health and fitness outlet. ""They are good for my body.
I have a massage belt, a massage hammer, and a massage chair
installed in my car. It's cheap stuff, cheap.""
 The Elite Sauna Belt, to reduce fat and decrease joint
stiffness, costs 50 dirhams, or about $13.50, including a remote
control. A Magic Hand massage hammer, usually priced at 150
dirhams, was on sale for 45 dirhams. Similar European models
cost four times as much.
 Trolleys loaded with children's bicycles and fluorescent
lights were parked at the cashier desk of the Suntour
restaurant, where the smell of stirfried vegetables and black
bean sauce filled the air.
 If it weren't for the veiled women and men in Arab garb,
this could be a corridor in any of China's factory cities,
crammed with merchandise and the cacophony of electric toys.
 Inaugurated in 2004, Dragon Mart, a retail property division
of the Dubai government's investment vehicle Dubai World, is one
of the largest trading centres for Chinese products in the world
outside China.
 According to the Federal Customs Authority of the United
Arab Emirates, non-oil trade between the Emirates and China
reached around 42.6 billion dirhams in the first 10 months of
2010, up 3.4 percent from the same period in 2009.
 There are almost 200,000 Chinese residents and more than
3,000 companies in the Emirates, according to the Chinese
Consulate. That compares with an estimated total population in
the Emirates of about five million.
 ""The Chinese economy is resource hungry, and there is a need
to access Gulf markets,"" said Mark McFarland, emerging markets
economist at Emirates NBD in Dubai, who had previously worked in
Hong Kong. ""The commerce with China is a symbol of its rise as
an economic power.""
 ""China has been at the forefront of free-trade agreements
with the UAE, which is of great benefit to both countries,"" he
said. ""Dubai is becoming a regional hub for a lot of Chinese
operations that are setting up in the region, but also develop
businesses in Africa.""
 The Dragon is a Chinese symbol of power and strength, and
the mall aptly symbolises the growing strength of China's
presence in the Emirates, where a growing number of Chinese
businesses have set up operations and store signs in Chinese
intermingle with those in Arabic.
 Some Emiratis have chosen to send their children to a
Chinese school, believing that knowledge of both Arabic and
Chinese will be a key to success in the coming decades.
 Hamid Kazim, an Emirati business consultant, has sent four
of his five children to a Chinese school in Dubai, where they
sit on bright green and yellow stools -- most likely bought at
Dragon Mart -- alongside Chinese, Malay and Brazilian children.
 ""I am an admirer of China. It's quite important for children
to be skilled in different areas,"" Kazim said.
 Chinese residents, meanwhile, are picking up Arabic. ""The
Chinese ambassador and the Chinese consul both speak very well
Arabic,"" said Hamdan Mohamed, president of the Arab Business
Club in Dubai.
 ""We have a big Chinese community in the UAE... To enter this
community you have to speak their language.""
 A natural global hub for long-distance flights between Asia,
Europe and Africa, ""Dubai is a great location which reflects
this,"" McFarland of Emirates NBD said.
 ""A lot of the companies here are construction and
manufacturing-oriented. You can envision a big increase in trade
between the UAE and China.""

 * Imbalances, banks, inflation top concerns at meeting
 * Fed, Chinese, ECB policymakers at Paris conference
 
 By Daniel Flynn and Marc Jones
 PARIS, March 4 (Reuters) - ECB policymaker Axel Weber warned
global central bankers on Friday that economic imbalances could
worsen faster than first expected to pre-crisis levels and urged
the G20 to push ahead with tackling them.
 Weber, soon to quit as head of Germany's Bundesbank, told a
meeting of U.S., euro zone and Asian policymakers that IMF
forecasts pointed to renewed divergences in current account
positions and that the surge in oil prices since unrest broke
out across North Africa would accelerate this.
 Weber also said currencies in many emerging economies remain
undervalued and said the United States should save more to curb
its reliance on foreign capital.
 Economic imbalances between wealthy and emerging nations are
proving one of the biggest headaches for policymakers striving
to repair the world economy after the most damaging crisis in
decades and reduce the risks of future shocks.
 ""Current account surpluses have returned or are currently
returning to pre-crisis levels and I think this will be sped up
by the fact that the recent hike in oil prices might
accelerate,"" Weber said.
 He was addressing a dozen global policymakers who joined
academics and businessmen under the banner of France's Group of
20 presidency to discuss imbalances, regulation, inflation and
other topics two weeks after G20 finance ministers fixed a set
of indicators to measure imbalances.
 The G20 finance ministers of the world's major economies
succeeded only in reaching a fudged accord on how to measure
imbalances in the global economy after China prevented the use
of exchange rates and currency reserves as indicators.
 ""The G20 is the only group that basically has legitimacy to
own this process (of tackling imbalances) and drive forward and
achieve results,"" Weber said.
 ""We have to start passing a judgment on what the
disequilibrium is. We have to embark on mechanisms to deal with
these current account problems and come up with a surveillance
process to make sure countries that commit to certain processes
at the national level see these policies through.""
 
 REGULATION, INFLATION HOT TOPICS
 Opening Friday's conference, Bank of France Governor and ECB
governing council member Christian Noyer noted that the
accumulation of foreign reserves by emerging economies was part
of the reason behind the globalised crisis. 
 He also told policymakers that the G20 still had significant
room to press ahead with financial regulation, particularly on
the structure of commodities markets and tighter regulation of
the ""shadow banking system"".
 Friday's gathering came a day after the European Central
Bank said it could soon raise interest rates, heightening
concerns about the implications for struggling euro zone
countries as EU leaders strive to resolve the debt crisis.
 Inflation and pressure elsewhere for tighter monetary policy
will also to be a key topic at Friday's meeting.
 China and other Asian and Latin American economies are
resisting pressure from Washington and Europe to raise interest
rates to curb signs of overheating in their economies and allow
their currencies to appreciate.
 Many of them point the finger squarely at the U.S. Federal
Reserve's new round of money printing via a $600 billion bond
purchase programme as the cause behind a wave of ""hot money""
inflows that risk destabilising their economies.
 China was represented on Friday by deputy central bank
governor Hu Xiaolian. It, and other emerging nations, may air
that criticism afresh.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Hopes of an improved U.S.
employment picture lifted shares on Friday, but the prospect of
higher interest rates in Europe and a rising oil price kept
other world markets on edge.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open
for Wall Street, adding to hefty gains on Thursday, but this is
likely to depend on the U.S. jobless report to be released
before the open.
 Analysts expecting employers to have hired more workers in
February than in any month since May last year.
 That would feed into the widespread belief that the U.S.
economy is in recovery mode and that the improvement should soon
trickle down into lagging consumer sentiment.
 At the same time, however, improved global growth is raising
inflation pressures, particularly threatening at the moment with
Middle East and North African political turmoil driving oil
prices to levels that could hurt recovery.
 Brent crude futures for April delivery were up 64 cents at
$115.43 a barrel, off their highs.
 The prospect of higher inflation prompted the European
Central Bank on Thursday to indicate it could raise interest
rates as soon as next month, a hawkishness that stunned many in
the market.
 Stock markets were nonetheless relatively buoyant on Friday,
lifted by economic optimism even if a number of market
participants said it was a tenuous stance.
 ""Any shortfall in the U.S. non-farm payrolls, or any
flare-ups on the geopolitical front could see the risk appetite
ebbing away once again,"" said Chris Weston, institutional trader
at IG Markets.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.4 percent, taking
the index up nearly 1.5 percent and not far from a new 30-month
high.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei
gained 1 percent.
 
 EURO BOOST
 The euro hit a four-month high against the dollar, lifted by
the competing push-pull of higher euro zone interest rates and a
stronger U.S. economy.
 ""We should see better non-farm payrolls figures, but if U.S.
yields don't rise, it won't help the dollar,"" said Marcus
Hettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 ""Interest rate differentials ... are playing in favour of
the euro, so we could see a break above $1.40 any time now.""
 Speculation of an ECB rate rise has expanded the yield
spread between two-year German and U.S. government debt, the
most sensitive maturity to official rate moves, to its widest
since January 2009.
 The euro was flat to slightly higher at $1.3970. The dollar
was flat against a basket of currencies.
 The euro zone bond market was little changed ahead of the
jobs data and following a sell off on Thursday.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - The euro held near a four-month
high against the dollar on Friday on expectations euro zone
interest rates may rise next month, while investors waited to
see if an expected improvement in U.S. jobs data would boost the
U.S. currency.
 The euro took a breather after surging as high as $1.3976
the previous day, when European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet stunned investors by saying a rate rise in
April was a possibility in its drive to fight inflation risks.
 Analysts said the euro was poised for more near-term gains
as the ECB's announcement, fortifying expectations the ECB will
raise rates well before the U.S. Federal Reserve, had widened
the gap between euro zone and U.S. government bond yields.
 Some said the market would take a cue from U.S. yields to
determine the dollar's move on U.S. payrolls due at 1330 GMT.
The central forecast in a Reuters poll is for 185,000 new jobs
to have been added to the economy last month, after an addition
of 36,000 in January.
 ""We should see a better non-farm payrolls figure, but if
U.S. yields don't rise, it won't help the dollar,"" said Marcus
Hettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 ""Interest rate differentials ... are playing in favour for
the euro, so we could see a break above $1.40 any time now.""
 ECB rate rise speculation has expanded the yield spread
between two-year German and U.S. government debt, the most
sensitive maturity to official rate moves, to around 1.0
percent, its widest since January 2009.
 Euro interest rate swaps soared across the curve with the
two-year rate hitting around 2.33 percent, highs not seen since
early 2009.
 Many in the market expected rate rise speculation to push
the euro higher, although some analysts pointed out the dangers
of tightening policy when the economies of some euro zone
countries are suffering from debt problems.
 In early European trade, the euro was flat on the day at
$1.3950. The euro edged up to a session high of $1.3969, but
offers above the psychologically key $1.40 were seen keeping a
lid on near-term gains.
 It hovered near its 200-week moving average around $1.3957.
A weekly close above that would pave the way for a move higher,
although some near-term resistance was seen around $1.3980, the
78.6 percent retracement of the euro's down move from November.
 ""We think the euro will remain strong in the next week or
two, possibly even testing ... highs of $1.4280,"" said
Christopher Gothard, head of FX for Brown Brothers Harriman in
Hong Kong, referring to the euro's next major peak on charts,
its early November high of $1.4283.
 The euro held gains against sterling and the yen, after the
single currency rallied to a four-month high against the
Japanese currency of 115.18 yen on EBS on Thursday.
 But the shared currency slipped 0.3 percent on the day to
1.2967 Swiss francs, which rallied after Swiss National Bank
Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan said rates in the country will have
to rise in the medium term.
 The dollar traded flat at 82.45 yen, and was at 76.529
against a currency basket, little changed on the day and
hovering near 76.385 hit on Thursday, its weakest since early
November.
 While some in the market said a post-payrolls jump in U.S.
Treasury yields may provide a dollar reprieve, analysts said a
disappointing reading could fan worries about the outlook for
the U.S. labour market.
 Such concerns could pick up given uncertainty about how the
recent surge in oil prices may affect the U.S. economy and
companies.

 By Aditya Suharmoko and Rieka Rahadiana	
 JAKARTA, March 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank kept
its benchmark interest rate steady on Friday, but vowed to
tackle stubbornly high inflation in an effort to placate those
market players worried it is falling behind the curve.	
 Bank Indonesia assured financial markets it would steadily
but gradually lift interest rates and also encourage a stronger
currency to control persistently high core inflation, which is
at a 13-month high.	
 While a slender majority of economists polled by Reuters had
forecast the overnight policy rate would be held steady
at 6.75 percent, several believed a 25 basis point rise would
have been more prudent.	
 The bank, however, said it was closely monitoring core
inflation, saw room for further appreciation in the rupiah to
temper imported inflation, and in a somewhat hawkish statement
said it would adjust rates in stages whenever necessary.	
 ""This decision does not change the direction of Bank
Indonesia's monetary policy that is tending to be tight to
manage high inflationary pressures,"" Bank Indonesia said, a
month after it raised rates for the first time in two years.	
 The central bank said it was confident headline inflation
could be kept on target at 4-6 percent for this year and at
3.5-5.5 percent in 2012, through a mixture of monetary and macro
prudential policies and strong government commitment to control
high food prices.	
 Economists weren't so sure.	
 ""I can't say whether BI's decision is right or wrong but I
think it would have been more prudent for them to hike the
rate,"" said Wellian Wiranto, an economist with HSBC in
Singapore. ""I think they are missing a very good chance to
strengthen their credibility.""	
 The rate decision comes on the back of a 25 basis point rise
last month that somewhat assuaged sceptical investors, and
follows data on Tuesday showing monthly food prices declining
for the first time in four years and inflation slowing.	
 Inflation triggered by food and fuel prices poses a dilemma
for developing economies of whether to tighten policy to rein in
inflation at a time when pricier oil will eat into national
income, both by hurting domestic consumers and impacting final
demand from the developed world.

 The overall stock market scarcely reacted after the
announcement -- although bank stocks rallied -- while the
currency and bond yields <0#IDBMK=> eased a touch. The
markets have recovered some ground after investors sold off in
January over concerns the central bank was behind the curve.	
 A sharp narrowing of the yield spread between 10- and 2-year
bonds to 108 bps suggested investors were gearing up for more
tightening in coming months, albeit slowly.	
 
 REACTIVE RATHER THAN PROACTIVE	
 ""Stepping aside from the need for hikes, today's inaction
shows that BI will be more reactive rather than proactive, and
they are likely to only hike as and when there is an upside
surprise to inflation print,"" Wiranto said in a note.	
 Analysts at Standard Chartered Bank said they now expected
the policy rate to end 2011 at 7.25 percent, not 7.5 as they
previously had forecast.	
 While the bank said on Friday it is was holding the rate
steady ""for now"", it made clear it would continue to use both
the benchmark rate and the rupiah's strength as tools to attract
foreign funds and fight inflation.	
 ""Bank Indonesia will keep pursuing steps on monetary and
macroprudential policies, including managing imported inflation
by rupiah strengthening,"" the bank said. 
 The central bank has been intervening in the foreign
exchange market to keep the currency at below 9,000 to the
dollar to meet an inflation target of between 4-6 percent for
2011. 
 On Friday the currency was trading at around 8,790.	
 Annual inflation in February slowed to 6.84 percent and
monthly food prices dipped. February's annual core inflation,
however, remained stubbornly up at 4.36 percent.	
 Analysts polled by Reuters before this week's data expected
Bank Indonesia to raise rates to 7.5 percent by the end of the
second quarter and leave it there until the year-end.	
 The central bank has normalised stimulus measures taken
during the 2008 financial crisis to absorb excess liquidity in
the financial system that can build up core inflation.	
 It has also raised dollar reserve requirements for
commercial banks and limited their short-term foreign
borrowings. . 
 Some of the new reserve requirements, which link the amount
a bank has to set aside to its loans-to-deposits ratio, kicked
in this month, which analysts said could be a reason Bank
Indonesia held off on raising rates.	
 The bank said on Friday it would keep strengthening
liquidity management.	
 The central bank adjusts its benchmark rate, used by banks
as reference to set lending rates, to support an economy that is
seen growing by 6.4 percent this year.	
 Bank Indonesia cut its policy rate by a total of 3
percentage points between December 2008 and August 2009 to
shield the economy from the financial crisis. They kept the
policy rate steady at 6.5 percent through 2010.

 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, March 4 (Reuters) - The euro took a
breather in its explosive rally ahead of influential U.S. jobs
data on Friday, but the single currency is set to stay in demand
after the European Central Bank signalled it may raise interest
rates as early as next month.	
 While the ECB had been expected to step up its

since early 2009.	
 The euro jumped to its highest in about four months of
$1.3976 on trading platform EBS on Thursday and last traded at
$1.3960 , down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on
Thursday.	
""We think the euro will remain strong in the next week or
two, possibly even testing...highs of $1.4280,"" said Christopher
Gothard, head of FX for Brown Brothers Harriman in Hong Kong,
referring to the euro's next major peak on charts, its early
November high of $1.4283. 
""Trichet's comments have bolstered rate hike expectations,
and even though we're not certain the scenario of an April hike
will play out - Europe still has the fiscal debt issues and poor
growth in many areas - for the moment it's providing support,""
Gothard added.	
 Against the yen, the common currency eased 0.2 percent to
114.93 yen , hovering near a four-month high of 115.18
yen hit on EBS on Thursday. 
 Having taken out resistance around 114.01, the late January
high that had capped the euro in February, the single currency
now looked poised to test 115.68, the early October high, said
Watt at RBC Dominion Securities.	
 
 EURO'S BROAD STRENGTH 
 In a sign of its broad strength in the wake of Trichet's
comments, the euro hit a 10-month high against the New Zealand
dollar of NZ$1.8935 on Friday and touched a five-week
high versus the Australian dollar near A$1.3800 .	
 The euro held steady against the Swiss franc at 1.3007 franc
after having surged 1.6 percent on Thursday for its
biggest one-day percentage gain since last September. 
 ""We see scope for rates to go up significantly further this
year, beyond the hike now widely expected in April,"" said
Kenneth Wattret, analyst at BNP Paribas.	
 While that could be supportive of the euro in the near-term,
there are worries that weaker peripheral euro zone countries
will suffer from tighter policy, which will then pressure the
single currency.	
 Strength in the euro kept the dollar stuck near a four-month
low against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index was
steady at 76.457 , hovering near Thursday's trough of
76.385, which was its lowest since early November.	
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent against the yen to 82.34 yen
, having rebounded after repeated tests of levels around
81.60 in the past few sessions failed to break new lows.	
 The dollar's near-term direction hinges on U.S. non-farm
payrolls data due later on Friday. Analysts polled by Reuters
expect the report to show a rise of 185,000, following a tepid
36,000 increase previously.	
 ""That will be good for the dollar and especially dollar/yen.
Markets are currently priced for no rate hikes in the U.S. until
2013. I think that (rate) call will start coming back in and
that will be positive for the dollar,"" a trader at a U.S.
investment bank said.	
 A disappointing number, however, could fan worries about the
outlook for the U.S. labour market, especially given uncertainty
about how the recent surge in oil prices may affect the U.S.
economy and companies, Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas
in Singapore.	
 ""If we get something below 125,000 or 120,000 I think there
will be an enormous amount of disappointment,"" Ryan said.	
 ""We could very quickly start talking about QE3 as a
realistic prospect,"" he said, referring to the issue of whether
the U.S. Federal Reserve will take further quantitative easing
measures after its $600 billion bond-buying programme is over.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, March 4 (Reuters) - The euro took a breather in its
explosive rally ahead of influential U.S. jobs data on Friday,
but the single currency is set to stay in demand after the
European Central Bank signalled it may raise interest rates as
early as next month.	
 While the ECB had been expected to step up its
anti-inflation rhetoric, nobody actually thought ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet would explicitly say an interest rate rise
at the next meeting was possible.	
 ""The market was unprepared for Trichet to lay the foundation
for an April rate hike,"" said David Watt, strategist at RBC
Dominion Securities.	
 Euro interest rate swaps soared across the curve with the
two-year rate hitting 2.30 percent, highs not seen
since early 2009.	
 The euro jumped to its highest in about four months of
$1.3976 on trading platform EBS on Thursday and last traded at

Gothard added.	
 Against the yen, the common currency eased 0.2 percent to
114.94 yen , hovering near a four-month high of 115.18
yen hit on EBS on Thursday. 
 A trader at a Japanese bank said the euro could face some
pressure against the yen due to the potential for euro selling
by Japanese exporters above 115 yen.	
 Having taken out resistance around 114.01, the late January
high that had capped the euro in February, the single currency
now looked poised to test 115.68, the early October high, said
Watt at RBC Dominion Securities.	
 In a sign of its broad strength in the wake of Trichet's
comments, the euro hit a 10-month high against the New Zealand
dollar of NZ$1.8935 on Friday and touched a five-week
high versus the Australian dollar near A$1.3800 .	
 The euro held steady against the Swiss franc at 1.3010 franc
after having surged 1.6 percent on Thursday for its

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, March 4 (Reuters) - Asian stocks are heading for
their biggest weekly gain in three months on bargain-hunting
after their recent drop while the euro perked up after the
central bank signalled a rate hike as early as next month.	
 Friday's gains brought stocks to near levels since the
Libyan crisis erupted, indicating markets have been largely
resilient to oil's near 15 percent surge in the past two weeks.	
 A reasonably strong correlation between Asian equities and
oil shows both track the broad growth story except for periods
when markets have grown nervous of a price shock because of the
resulting spillover impact on inflation and growth.	
 The region is a big importer of oil. 
 But the pull-back in Brent crude prices from 2-1/2
year highs after a key technical indicator rose to its most
overbought level in more than five years, eased oil worries for
the region.	
 Hopes that U.S. jobs data due later may show strong gains
and reinforce expectations of a steady improvement in the
world's biggest economy boosted stocks across the region with
Tokyo and Seoul ending up more than a percent
each.	
 Further gains on Wall Street appear difficult with the S&P
500 set to run into strong resistance around the 1,340-60
zone. The index ended up 1.72 percent at 1,330.97 points.	
 The broader MSCI index of Asia-ex Japan stocks
rose more than 1 percent with buying scattered
across financials, industrials and materials.	
 For the week, it is up nearly 3 percent, heading for its its
biggest weekly rise since early December.

 Brent's Relative Strength Index: http://link.reuters.com/wub48r
 Asia equities and oil correlations:http://link.reuters.com/xas38r
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The median estimate is for a gain of 185,000 jobs, according
to economists polled by Reuters, but market sentiment was
leaning toward a number above 200,000, traders said.	
 Notwithstanding the Libyan crisis, Asian markets have
generally underperformed this year as inflows into emerging
market funds have slowed sharply due to concerns of inflation
and crowded positioning in some of the region's markets.	
 But the latest oil driven sell-off has cleaned up some of
the technical positioning and enhanced the attractiveness of
certain markets such as Korea, according to Barclays Capital
strategists.	
 Foreign investors were net buyers for a second
straight day in the stock market, the strongest since January.	
 ""The return of foreign investors has given the market
significant support. However, buying appears to be
short-covering to close short position for now,"" said Kwak
Joong-bo, a market analyst at Samsung Securities.	
 In credit, the benchmark for non-Japan Asia, the iTraxx
investment grade index saw its spreads tighten by 3
bps to 105/107, reflecting the broader demand for risky assets.	
 
 EURO RISES	
 Gains in stocks diminished the safe-haven appeal for gold
and U.S. Treasuries with two-year debt yields rising
by as much as eight basis points to 0.77 percent.	
 In currency markets, the euro paused after a sharp
rally overnight after the European Central bank signalled an
interest rate hike as early as April. 
 The single currency jumped to a near four-month highs of
$1.3976 and last traded at $1.3961. Against the yen, the euro
hit four-month highs at 115.17 and last stood at
114.94.	
 ""We see scope for rates to go up significantly further this
year, beyond the hike now widely expected in April,"" said
Kenneth Wattret, analyst at BNP Paribas.	
 The pull back in oil and hawkish rhetoric from the ECB
forced spot gold to snap a four-day rally. Silver
fell more than a percent.	
 Asian currencies were generally higher after the Beijing set
a record high mid-point for the second day indicating
authorities were using the yuan to help fight high
inflation.

 * Germany, Ireland expected to face off over bailout aid
 * Aim to forge common position before March summits
 
 By Terhi Kinnunen
 HELSINKI, March 4 (Reuters) -European leaders from
centre-right political parties will discuss the euro zone debt
crisis at a meeting on Friday and try to forge a common position
before two critical summits later this month.
 Invited by Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen, the
dozen leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and Irish
prime-minister-elect Enda Kenny, will discuss the interest rate
on Irish bailout loans and other debt issues.
 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, the president of
the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, and European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso will also attend the meeting of
European People's Party (EPP) leaders.
 The aim is to find a common position on a ""comprehensive
package"" of measures that euro zone leaders will hammer out at a
summit on March 11, before EU leaders sign off on the deal at a
meeting in Brussels on March 24/25. They hope the package will
draw a line under the region's year-long debt crisis.
 Friday's meeting will take no formal decisions but is
expected to shape thinking on the overall effort to contain the
debt crisis and may produce a clash between Germany and Ireland
over Ireland's 85 billion euro bailout, agreed last November.
 Dublin sees the interest rates on its bailout loans --
around 5.8 percent -- as punitive, but Germany is reluctant to
reduce them, saying it was Ireland that asked for the help.
 Katainen said Kenny, whose party won an election last month,
had asked for the interest rate to be put on the agenda and it
was now likely to be discussed, though it remains unclear if
Kenny and Merkel will hold face-to-face talks.
 ""The issue will probably be raised,"" Katainen told reporters
in Helsinki on Thursday. ""It will be a good opportunity to
listen to what the European Commission's views on the matter
are.""
 ""We must look at the big picture and review what is
Ireland's debt sustainability level. The essential thing is that
Ireland can pay back its debt."" 
 Merkel said on Wednesday that if Ireland had problems with
the interest rate she would consider the issue, but said Dublin
could not expect to pay less for its rescue loans than Portugal
is paying to refinance itself in the market -- around 7.4
percent for 10-year bonds.
 ""We cannot artificially reduce interest rates. Ireland and
Greece have taken aid,"" she said, pointing out that Ireland's
assistance package was still only a few months old.
 
 BAILOUT FUND
 Another point of discussion is likely to be a German-French
initiative for a ""competitiveness pact"" across the euro zone,
including measures to put legal limits on deficits, encourage
the gradual raising of retirement ages and work towards a common
corporate tax base.
 The German and French plan raised hackles among euro zone
member states when it was put on the table in early February,
but after consultations with Van Rompuy, a re-worked
competitiveness pact has gained more broad-based support.
 Katainen, who leads his Kokoomus party into an election in
April, said the key was for all euro zone countries to be aiming
at the same targets, not pulling in different directions.
 ""For us it is important that, whatever we do, the whole EU
area will have common rules, this cannot become an
inter-government exercise driven by large countries,"" he said.
 Another critical issue that may be raised on Friday is the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion
euro rescue fund set up last May and used to bail out Ireland.
 Because of guarantees built into the EFSF to maintain its
triple-A credit rating and allow it to raise money more cheaply
on international markets, the facility has an effective lending
capacity of only around 250 billion euros.
 The European Commission and many euro zone member states
want the threshold raised to the full 440 billion euros, but
Germany's backing is needed and Berlin is reluctant without a
strong commitment from the euro zone on competitiveness.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street scored its best
one-day rally in three months on Thursday, due to a pullback
in oil prices and upbeat labor market data, while the euro
jumped on the European Central Bank president's inflation
warning.
 Data showing new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits
fell last week to their lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years
represented the latest optimistic reading to bolster hopes for
an upside surprise in Friday's key payrolls report.
 ""There are still concerns about high oil prices, but the
bottom line is: The U.S. economy is improving. We continue to
get confirmations of that, and it's a good sentiment heading
into Friday's numbers,"" said Ryan Detrick, technical analyst
at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's comments on
inflationary risks were widely expected, but he surprised
investors by saying the bank may raise interest rates as soon
as next month.
 The heightened concerns about inflation followed months of
sharp gains in oil and other commodities, with Brent crude oil
up roughly 15 percent since the end of January.
 The latest batch of purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) in
Europe and elsewhere suggested fast-building inflationary
pressures. For details, see [ID:nLDE7220L8]
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI Index <.MIWD00000PUS>
rose 1.1 percent.
 On Wall Street, both the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> and the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index
<.SPX> posted their biggest one-day gains since Dec. 1.
 OIL EASES
 Oil prices fell after Venezuela President Hugo Chavez made
a proposal to broker a peace deal in Libya.
 Some oil analysts suggested the Chavez proposal was a
convenient excuse for traders to adjust their positions.
 ""The market was a little overstretched to the upside, and
the Chavez peace proposal gave traders a reason to square
positions,"" said Tom Bentz, broker at BNP Paribas Commodities
Futures Inc in New York.
 Brent crude oil  fell $1.56 to settle at $114.79 a
barrel. On Wednesday, crude approached 2-1/2-year highs as
violence escalated in oil producer Libya.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April crude 
fell 32 cents, or 0.31 percent, to settle at $101.91 a
barrel.
 Investors worry if it is not halted soon, the political
instability could spread to major oil producer Saudi Arabia, a
central U.S. ally in the region, and other oil suppliers.

 Earlier this week, ADP data showed U.S. private-sector
employers added more jobs than forecast last month.
 In another sign of improvement in the labor market, a
gauge of employment in a report on the U.S. services sector on
Thursday rose to a near five-year high in February.

 The non-manufacturing index rose to 59.7 in February,
slightly above forecasts and higher than the January result.
[ID:nEAP101300]
 A Reuters survey for Friday's February jobs report shows
nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 185,000 after
snowstorms held growth to a paltry 36,000 jobs in January. The
survey was conducted before data on Monday showed strong
factory hiring, which prompted some economists to rethink
their forecasts. [ID:nN02222564]
 Market sentiment was leaning toward a number above
200,000, traders said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 191.40
points, or 1.59 percent, to end at 12,258.20. The S&P 500 rose
22.53 points, or 1.72 percent, to finish at 1,330.97. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> jumped 50.67 points, or 1.84

 The broad S&P 500 is down only about 1 percent from a peak
in late February after falling around 3 percent due to the
violence in Libya.
 As stocks rose on the jobless claims data, U.S. bonds

(Adds details, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro rallied strongly to
a fresh four-month high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday,
edging toward the psychologically important $1.40 level, after
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet cemented
expectations of a near-term interest rate rise.
 In a press conference after the ECB left its benchmark rate
steady at 1.0 percent, Trichet said the bank will exercise
""strong vigilance"" over rising inflation, a phrase that in the
past signaled a rate rise was only a month away.
 ""The market was expecting hawkish comments, but I think the
opening up of the door to a hike as early as the next meeting
is what's really propagated this, so you're seeing the euro
appreciate across the board,"" said Firas Askari, head of FX
trading at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""How sustainable this is is really a question mark. He did
say he's not expecting a series of rate hikes,"" he said,
adding: ""I'm not a long-term buyer of the euro.""
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3976 on trading platform
EBS, its strongest level since early November, after rising
above resistance around its 200-week moving average at $1.3958.
It last traded at $1.3963, up 0.7 percent on the day.
 Analysts said the euro is set to remain supported ahead of
the ECB's next meeting in early April, but they added that the
currency is likely to run into strong resistance in the $1.40
area and a rise above could attract fresh selling interest.
 ""I'm very alert right now for some potential
profit-taking,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster in New Jersey.
 Trichet's comments that the ECB would carry on providing
unlimited funding at its three-month operations for the next
three months also suggests ""there's ongoing fragility in the
European banking sector,"" Dolan added.
 A rise in interest rates would push up borrowing costs
across the 17-country euro zone, increasing the cost of funding
for highly indebted countries.
 But Askari said it seems clear that the concern about
inflation in Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands
outweighs any worries in Trichet's mind about Spain, Portugal,
Ireland and Greece.
 ""When you look at the relative size of the economies, it
seems that he's making a call on the overall economic value of
Europe,"" Askari said.
 FED LAGGING
 The strong indication that a rise will come in April put
the ECB in pole position to hike well before the U.S. Federal
Reserve and even the Bank of England, which analysts had
expected to move first.
 The euro jumped as high as 114.99 yen on EBS, also the
highest since early November. It rose 1 percent to 85.75 pence
and was up 1.5 percent at 1.3000 Swiss francs.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 82.36 yen, getting a lift
after data showed new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits
fell last week to their lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years.
 A separate report showed the U.S. services sector grew at a
slightly faster pace in February to another five-year high.
 Some traders said the dollar could gain if U.S. nonfarm
payrolls data for February, due on Friday, comes in stronger
than expected, though the move is unlikely to gain traction as
the Fed remains committed to its stimulative monetary policy.
""The bottom line is that two out of the three major central
banks will soon start normalizing monetary policy,"" said
Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset
Management LLP in London, which oversees $900 million in
assets. ""With the Fed still firm on keeping rates low for long,
all this is likely to keep weighing on the U.S. dollar.""

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks shot up on
Thursday after a pullback in oil prices and upbeat U.S. labor
market data, while the euro rallied on the European Central
Bank president's warning about inflation.
 Data showing new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits
fell last week to their lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years
was the latest optimistic reading to bolster hopes for an
upside surprise in Friday's key payrolls report.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's comments on
inflationary risks were widely expected, but he surprised
investors by saying the bank may raise interest rates as soon
as next month.
 The heightened concerns about inflation followed months of
sharp gains in oil and other commodities, with Brent crude oil
up about 15 percent since the end of January.
 The latest batch of purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) in
Europe and elsewhere suggested fast-building inflationary
pressures. For details, see [ID:nLDE7220L8]
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI Index <.MIWD00000PUS>
rose 1.1 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up more than 200 points, or 1.7 percent.
 ""The package of (U.S.) data from this week points to a
stronger-than-consensus estimate for tomorrow,"" said Quincy
Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark,
New Jersey, referring to a rise in non-farm payrolls.
 On Wednesday, ADP data showed U.S. private-sector
employers added more jobs than forecast last month. In another
encouraging sign, a gauge of employment in a report on the
U.S. services sector on Thursday rose to a near five-year high
in February. [ID:nN02222564]
 A Reuters survey for Friday's February jobs report shows
nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 185,000 after
snowstorms held growth to a paltry 36,000 jobs in January. The
survey was conducted before data on Monday showed strong
factory hiring, which prompted some economists to rethink
their forecasts. [ID:nN02222564]
 The ""whisper number"" among traders is that the non-farm
payrolls will rise by over 200,000.
 OIL DROPS, GOLD SLIPS
 Oil prices fell after Venezuela President Hugo Chavez made
a proposal to broker a peace deal in Libya.
 Some oil analysts suggested the Chavez proposal was a
convenient excuse for traders to adjust their positions.
 ""Looks like profit taking and buying into the dip. The
market was a little overstretched to the upside and the Chavez
peace proposal gave traders a reason to square positions,""
said Tom Bentz, broker at BNP Paribas Commodities Futures Inc
in New York.
 Brent crude oil  fell $1.56 to settle at $114.79 a
barrel. On Wednesday, crude approached 2-1/2-year highs as
violence escalated in oil producer Libya.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April crude 
fell 32 cents, or 0.31 percent, to settle at $101.91 a
barrel.
 Investors worry if it is not halted soon, the political
instability could spread to major oil producer Saudi Arabia, a
central U.S. ally in the region, and other oil suppliers.

 * Full year's data will help to assess impact
 
 BRUSSELS, March 3 (Reuters) - Brazil is gathering data from
its business sector to determine if it should sue the European
Union at the World Trade Organization over limits on poultry
imports, a Brazilian diplomat said on Thursday.
 At issue are rules in force since May that have shut EU
markets to frozen chicken meat from Brazilian exporters such as
food processing giant Brasil Foods, which is thawed and
processed in Europe into foods including marinated chicken for
barbecues and fresh ravioli.
 ""We've told the Commission the possibility of a challenge at
the World Trade Organization is not off the table. We will have
a full year's data available soon, which will help us make a
decision,"" said a Brazilian trade diplomat in Brussels.
 ""We are waiting for the economic data from the private
sector. They have to show us there has been a negative impact
for them,"" the diplomat said.
 The EU's executive Commission says thawed meat may not be
used to make ""fresh"" ready meals because that would mislead
European consumers. Instead, such meals must be sold as frozen.
 Brazil says the new rules discriminate against non-EU
producers, who usually freeze chicken meat for transport to the
bloc.
 An EU official played down Brazil's threat.
 ""To date the Brazilian authorities have not indicated to the
Commission their intent to request consultations,"" the official
said.
 A global agricultural powerhouse, Brazil exports about $1.5
billion of poultry to the European Union every year, worrying
European farmers in countries such as France.
 A WTO case could sour recently revived negotiations to
create a free trade area between the EU and the Mercosur bloc --
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
 But Brazil has a history of successful claims at the WTO,
forcing the EU to reform its sugar subsidy regime and back down
in a row over generic medicines transiting through the bloc.

 * China still keeping its currency undervalued
 * Global growth resuming but pace is uneven
(adds details, background, paragraphs 5-6)
 By Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - Rich nations could tap
strategic oil reserves if needed to ward off the risk that
Middle East political unrest triggers an inflationary price
spiral, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday.
 In wide-ranging testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Geithner again tweaked China for keeping
its currency too low and assured lawmakers he was committed to
expanding U.S. overseas trade while playing down risks that oil
prices were a threat to a budding recovery.
 He said there was ""considerable"" spare oil production
capacity around the world and ""substantial"" reserves on hand.
 ""If necessary, those reserves could be mobilized to help
mitigate the effect of a severe, sustained supply disruption,""
he said. Political protests have swept through parts of the
Middle East and North Africa, sending tremors through markets
for fear it could spread to key producers such as Saudi
Arabia.
 Geithner did not appear to be signaling any short-term
intent to dip into U.S. reserves but rather to make the point
that there were options if a lengthy interruption of supplies
occurred.
 Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, created in the
mid-1970s after the Arab oil embargo, is a relatively rare
event and it has been U.S. policy to turn to the emergency
supply only when faced with a major supply disruption.
 The last time it was done was in 2005 following Hurricane
Katrina and it drove oil prices down by about 9 percent at the
time.

 prices and global recovery: http://link.reuters.com/pyz38r
 For a graphic on oil's effect on world growth, see:

 Unrest in oil producer Libya has propelled U.S. crude oil
futures  above $100 a barrel in recent days. Crude had
traded at roughly $86 before protests struck Egypt in late
January, the first in a wave of unrest that has encompassed
much of the region.
 Geithner said the Obama administration was monitoring
Middle East developments closely and acknowledged that rising
commodity prices -- for both food and oil -- were causing
hardship in many parts of the world by pushing prices up.
 But he said Americans were feeling less impact.
 ""In the United States, rising gasoline prices have left
consumers with less money to spend, but underlying inflation
across all goods and services is modest,"" Geithner said.
 He also repeated a call for global agreement on ""stronger
norms for exchange rate policies"" to ensure that some countries
don't use an artificially low currency rate to benefit their
own economies at the expense of other nations.
 ""There is broad consensus that the major economies -- not
just Europe, Japan and the United States, but also the large
emerging economies -- need to allow their exchange rates to
adjust in response to market forces,"" Geithner said.
 He said China's yuan currency ""remains substantially
undervalued"" and said there has been limited progress in
getting Beijing to let it rise in value more rapidly.
 The global economy is gradually regaining its footing after
three years of crisis, Geithner said, though the pace of growth
was uneven and unbalanced.
 Geithner pointed to forecasts from the International
Monetary Fund that envision emerging-market economies will
expand 6.5 percent this year while Japan and Europe will manage
only 1.5 percent growth.
 The global recovery had already been pushing oil prices up
before the recent disruptions from Middle East unrest.
 Deutsche Bank economist Peter Hooper said roughly $10 to
$15 a barrel of that can be tied to concerns about possible
supply disruptions from unrest in Libya and the Middle East.
 If prices stay around $110, Hooper estimated it would trim
0.35 percentage point off of U.S. economic output, a moderate
hit considering economists expect growth in the 3.4 percent
range this year.

 BRUSSELS, March 3 (Reuters) - Europe's top trade negotiator
called for greater commercial ties with North African states
making the transition to democracy on Thursday, saying he will
unveil new proposals to achieve this next week.
 Europe and its neighbours along the sourthern and eastern
rim of the Mediterranean have long debated opening borders to
exports and workers.
 But progress has been thwarted by political tensions between
them and EU reluctance to allow cheap food and labour from
Africa into the 27-state bloc.
 ""We have to be willing to open our markets,"" Karel De Gucht
told a committee of lawmakers at the European Parliament. ""We
will go to the core of the choice whether or not we want to be
protectionist.""
 The toppling of Tunisia's and Egypt's governments as well as
near-civil war in Libya have revived calls from European policy
makers for commercial ties with the region to ensure economic
and political stability.
 Proposals for greater trade integration with North African
states to be put forward next Wednesday will require ""courage""
from EU governments and lawmakers, De Gucht said.
 
 CHASTENED BY PAKISTAN EXPERIENCE
 But De Gucht said he will not seek unilateral trade
concessions or cuts to import tariffs such as those the European
Union granted its war-ravaged Balkan neighbours in the 1990s.
 He cited the unsuccessful EU attempt to grant temporary
duty-free access to imports from Pakistan, an initiative that
policymakers hoped would help Pakistan recover from last
summer's floods.
 That initiative has been halted by vetos from other
non-European members of the World Trade Organization, where it
must be approved unanimously, De Gucht said.
 ""We bravely proposed this with respect to Pakistan,"" he
said.
 ""It simply doesn't work out in Geneva. There are countries
who as a matter of principle refuse to make a linkage between
trade and a natural disaster. I think you would see even more
resistance if you were to try and link it to transition to
democracy,"" he said.
 ""It is the very clear position of key stakeholders that they
are not willing to proceed.""
 Lawmakers at the European Parliament, who can veto EU trade
deals, called for careful deliberation on the issue.
 ""We need a policy for how we can, and whether we should, use
trade policy for political purposes,"" said Vital Moreira, a
socialist Portuguese lawmaker chairing the assembly's trade
committee.

 *Risks in implementation of fiscal measures, GDP growth
(Adds details, background)
 BUDAPEST, March 3 (Reuters) - Hungary's fiscal measures
announced this week are supportive for its current debt rating,
while the negative rating outlook reflects remaining risks, a
senior official of rating agency Moody's said on Thursday.
 The government unveiled steps on Tuesday to cut Hungary's
public debt, the highest in Central Europe at about 80 percent
of GDP, to 65-70 percent by the end of 2014 and reduce the
budget deficit to 2.2 percent of GDP by 2013.
 The measures including new tax revenues and some painful
cuts in state subsidies and benefits were aimed at retaining
investors' confidence and averting the threat of a downgrade by
rating agencies to junk debt status.
 ""I see the announcement as being supportive for the current
rating, but there are two main risks with the fiscal package,
which need to be monitored,"" Dietmar Hornung, lead analyst of
Hungary and Senior Credit Officer at the agency told Reuters.
 ""First is the implementation risk, whether the government
is able and willing to implement the measures that are needed
to achieve the adjustment as proposed. Second, the growth
risk.""
 ""The outlook is negative and reflects a certain balance of
risks here which is still to the downside.""
 Moody's rates Hungary Baa3, one notch above junk status,
with negative outlook on the rating.
 The government expects the new package and other measures
to lift employment and boost annual economic growth to between
4-6 percent in the next years from 1.2 percent in 2010.
 ""This is above our expectations,"" Hornung said. ""In case
economic growth will be lower than the Hungarian government's
forecasts, this will add to the pressure on public finances.""
 Hornung said Moody's would continuously monitor those risks
and Hungary's rating.
 When asked what could lead to a downgrade, he said: ""A
significant deterioration in Hungary's creditworthiness,
economic strength or government financial strength would
trigger a change in the rating.""
 Government officials have said that a successful fiscal
programme could make rating agencies upgrade the country and
help reduce the country's big interest rate payment burden.
 Hornung said: ""A stabilization of Hungary's government
financial strength and a decrease in its external
vulnerabilities would be rating positive.""
 Earlier Hungarian Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy
criticized rating agencies who downgraded or put the country on
a negative watch list last year. [ID:nLDE7220LV]
 Standard & Poor's and Fitch rate Hungary BBB-, also a notch
above the junk category and with negative outlook. They have
not commented on the country's new fiscal programme yet.

 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro gained against the
U.S. dollar to a fresh four-month high on Thursday, edging
toward the psychologically important $1.40 level, after
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet cemented
expectations of a near-term interest rate rise.
 In a press conference after the ECB left its benchmark rate
at 1.0 percent, Trichet said the bank will exercise ""strong
vigilance"" over rising inflation, a phrase that in the past
signaled a rate rise was only a month away.
 ""The market was expecting hawkish comments, but I think the

appreciate across the board,"" said Firas Askari, head of FX
trading at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""How sustainable this is is really a question mark. He did
say he's not expecting a series of rate hikes,"" he added. ""I'm
not a long-term buyer of the euro.""
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3976 on trading platform
EBS, its strongest level since early November, after rising
above resistance around its 200-week moving average at $1.3958.
It last traded at $1.3937, up 0.5 percent on the day.
Analysts said the euro is set to remain supported ahead of the
ECB's next meeting in early April but they added that the
currency is likely to run into strong resistance in the $1.40
area and a rise above could attract fresh selling interest.
""I'm very alert right now for some potential profit-taking,""
said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster in New Jersey.
 Dolan added that Trichet's comments that the ECB would
carry on providing unlimited funding at its three-month
operations for the next three months also suggests ""there's
ongoing fragility in the European banking sector.""
 A rise in interest rates would push up borrowing costs
across the 17-country euro zone, increasing the cost of funding
for highly indebted countries.
 Askari said it seems clear that the concern about inflation
in Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands outweighs any
worries in Trichet's mind about Spain, Portugal, Ireland and
Greece.
 ""When you look at the relative size of the economies, it
seems that he's making a call on the overall economic value of
Europe,"" Askari said.
 FED LAGGING
 The strong indication that a rise will come in April put
the ECB in pole position to hike well before the U.S. Federal
Reserve and even the Bank of England, which analysts had
expected to move first.
 The euro jumped as high as 114.98 yen on EBS, also the
highest since early November. It also rose 0.9 percent to 85.73
pence and was up 1.5 percent at 1.2994 Swiss francs.
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent to 82.46 yen, getting a lift
after data showed new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits
fell last week to their lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years.
A separate report showed the U.S. services sector grew at a
slightly faster pace in February to another five-year high.
 Some traders said the dollar could gain if U.S. nonfarm
payrolls data for February, due on Friday, comes in stronger
than expected, though the move is unlikely to gain traction as
the Fed remains committed to its stimulative monetary policy.
 ""The bottom line is that two out of the three major central
banks will soon start normalizing monetary policy,"" said
Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset

 (Adds detail, quotes)
 By Emma Farge
 LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The Swiss branch of Libyan oil
company Tamoil said on Thursday United Nations sanctions could
affect the group's ability to source crude and that high oil
prices had forced it to cut refinery runs.
 Tamoil also said it was already running its 72,000
barrel-per-day Swiss Collombey refinery at reduced rates and on
reserve stocks, making it the first refiner in Europe to confirm
run cuts.
 Western countries, the European Union and the United Nations
have imposed sanctions on Libya and frozen government assets
after forces loyal to leader Muammar Gaddafi fired on protestors
in the oil-producing country.
 ""The problem we could have -- and I put this in the
conditional -- is if one company in the group is touched by the
U.N. resolution ... For example, if we can't get crude and then
we can't work,"" spokesman Laurent Paoliello told Reuters on
Thursday.
 The company is tracking the U.N. decision to see whether it
proves to be more constraining than the Swiss and European Union
sanctions, which have had no impact on operations, he said.
 Switzerland said on Feb. 24 it was freezing any assets
Gaddafi and his family might have in the country.
 Paoliello said the refinery might have to shut temporarily
in a few weeks if oil prices remain high but that it is
currently meeting all of its supply contracts.
 Libyan oil supply disruptions spurred Brent crude prices to
2-1/2 year highs near $120 a barrel in late February, crushing
European refining margins and wiping out profits for making the
motor fuel gasoline.
 ""It is clear that the movement in the price of oil has
resulted in a slowdown of refinery operations, and we're now
running on reserve stocks,"" said Paoliello.
 Tamoil also owns refineries in Italy and Germany.
 The refinery has not used Libyan oil in the past two years
and is now sourcing its crude from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, he
added.

 * Higher rates could strain peripheral euro zone
 * EU leaders to discuss cost of Ireland's bailout loans
 * Successful Spanish auction distances it from Portugal
 
 (Adds bond market reaction, paragraphs 8-9) 
 By Paul Carrel and Terhi Kinnunen
 FRANKFURT/HELSINKI, March 3 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank warned on Thursday it could soon raise interest rates,
heightening concerns about the implications for struggling euro
zone countries as EU leaders strive to resolve the debt crisis.
 If the central bank were to raise interest rates to stem
inflation, possibly as early as next month, it would push up the
costs of borrowing across the 17-country euro zone, increasing
the cost of funding for highly indebted countries such as
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and others on the euro zone periphery.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet was explicit in a news
conference after the bank decided to keep interest rates on hold
at a record low 1.0 percent saying: ""An increase in interest
rates at the next meeting is possible.""
 Analysts said they were concerned about the ramifications of
a rate rise for countries such as Ireland, which is already
frustrated by the high rate of interest being charged on its
EU/IMF bailout loans, which stands at around 5.8 percent.
 ""We believe the risks assigned to such a decision are high
in a context of the periphery situation remaining under stress,""
said Jacques Cailloux of RBS European Economics.
 Trichet did say a series of rate rises was not on the cards,
limiting damage to the likes of Portugal, widely regarded as the
euro state most likely to need emergency EU/IMF assistance next,
following in the footsteps of Greece and Ireland.
 A successful bond issue by Spain on Thursday suggests it is
under considerably less threat, though markets could still turn
their fire in its direction if Portugal succumbs.
 Yields on peripheral debt rose, but relative to Bunds
spreads were tighter, indicating that there was little sign of
panic selling in bond markets.
 The Portuguese 10-year bond yield rose 8 bps on the day,
approaching its highest since the launch of the euro currency of
around 7.565 percent, but traders said the move was prompted by
a sharp rise in core German debt yields.

 HELSINKI MEETING
 Centre-right EU leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel
and Ireland's Enda Kenny, will meet in Helsinki on Friday.
 The gathering has been called to try to forge agreement on a
""comprehensive package"" of measures that EU leaders hope will
draw a line under their year-long debt crisis. They are aiming
to agree the full package at a summit on March 24/25.
 But Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen, who called the
meeting, said Ireland wanted to discuss the costs of its
bailout, and that was also likely to be on the agenda.
 ""The issue will probably be raised,"" Katainen said.
 ""We must look at the big picture and review what is
Ireland's debt sustainability level. The essential thing is that
Ireland can pay back its debt."" 
 Merkel said on Wednesday that if Ireland had problems with
the interest rate she would discuss it, but said Dublin could
not presume to pay less for its rescue loans.
 ""We cannot artificially reduce interest rates. Ireland and
Greece have taken aid,"" she said, adding that Ireland's package,
agreed in November, was only a few months old.
 
 PREPARATORY MEETING
 Friday's gathering in Helsinki will not produce any formal
decisions but is expected to shape thinking ahead of a summit of
heads of state from the 17 euro zone countries on March 11.
 That meeting will discuss economic governance, with France
and Germany intent on having the rest of the euro zone sign up
to a ""competitiveness pact"", and may touch on the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro rescue
fund set up in May last year and used to bail out Ireland.
 Because of guarantees built into the EFSF to maintain its
triple-A credit rating and allow it to raise money more cheaply
on international markets, the facility only has an effective
lending capacity of around 250 billion euros.
 The European Commission and many euro zone member states
want the threshold raised to the full 440 billion euros, but
Germany's backing is needed and Berlin is reluctant.
 Katainen said competitiveness -- including issues such as
countries agreeing legal limits on the size of their deficits,
gradually raising retirement ages and agreeing a common
corporate tax base -- would be discussed on Friday.
 ""For us it is important that, whatever we do, the whole EU
area will have common rules, this cannot become an
inter-government exercise driven by large countries,"" he said.
 
 SPAIN SELLS BONDS BUT AT A COST
 While Ireland is intent on securing a better deal on its
bailout, EU policymakers are increasingly concerned about
Portugal which is seen as likely to need a bailout as soon as
April.
 Spain, another potential recipient of EU aid if the
contagion were to spread beyond Portugal, held a successful
auction of three- and five-year bonds on Thursday, which helped
lift some of the gloom in financial markets.
 The Treasury easily sold a total of 3.8 billion of 2014 and
2016 dated bonds, but the yields were around 35 basis points
higher than at the last auction of similar bonds on Feb. 3.
 ""What it really tends to reinforce ... is that there's been
a very distinct dissociation between Spain and Portugal,
particularly over the last three or four weeks and this really
underscores that,"" said Marc Ostwald, strategist at Monument
Securities. ""But one wonders how durable this is going to be.""

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks charged higher
on Thursday, driven by better-than-expected U.S. labor market
data and a pullback in oil prices, while the ECB president's
warning about inflation triggered a rally in the euro.
 Data showing new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits
fell last week to their lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years
was the latest optimistic reading to bolster hopes for an
upside surprise in Friday's key payrolls report.
 While European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet's comments on inflationary risks were widely expected,
he surprised investors by saying the bank may raise interest
rates as soon as next month.
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI Index <.MIWD00000PUS>
rose 0.9 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 179.10 points, or 1.5 percent.
 The progressively stronger data ""has got hopes up that we
are going to see better-looking non-farm payrolls numbers"" in
the Labor Department data, said Scott Marcouiller, chief
technical market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St.
Louis.
 On Wednesday, ADP data showed U.S. private-sector
employers added more jobs than expected last month. The Labor
Department's closely watched monthly payrolls report for
February is due on Friday.
 OIL AND GOLD SLIP
 Oil prices declined after Venezuela President Hugo Chavez
made a proposal to try to broker a peace deal in Libya.
 Some oil analysts suggested the Chavez proposal was a
convenient excuse for traders to adjust their positions.
 ""If it's coming out of Chavez, it might not have a great
degree of substance,"" said Tim Riddell, head of technical
analysis at ANZ in Singapore.
 ""The fact that the markets have been so volatile, and
without having concrete evidence of any material shift in the
unrest in the Arab world, suggests to me that we are at best
consolidating.""
 Brent crude oil  was down $1.86 at $114.49 a
barrel. On Wednesday, crude approached 2-1/2-year highs as
violence escalated in oil producer Libya.
 Investors worry that if it is not soon halted, political
instability could spread to major oil producer Saudi Arabia, a
central U.S. ally in the region, and other oil suppliers.
 Rising prices for oil and other commodities are pushing up
prices for goods around the world, causing the heightened
concern about inflation risks.
 The latest batch of purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) in
Europe and elsewhere again pointed to fast-building
inflationary pressures, with Europe's private sector surging
at its fastest pace in almost five years in February. For
details, see [ID:LDE7220L8]

 The euro pierced resistance around $1.3958, its 200-week
moving average, to hit as high as $1.3976 , its
strongest since Nov. 8, and on track to test the
psychologically important $1.40 level.
 Gold prices fell on Trichet's comment. Spot gold ,
which hit a record high this week, dropped as low as $1,417.22
an ounce.
 Trichet said the ECB will exercise ""strong vigilance"" over
rising inflation. For Trichet's comments see [ID:nLOOKCBANK].
 In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> was up 179.10 points, or 1.48 percent, at 12,245.90.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 20.00 points, or

was up 51.67 points, or 1.88 percent, at 2,799.73.
 As stocks rose, U.S. bonds fell. The benchmark 10-year
note  was down 23/32, its yield rising to 3.56
percent from 3.47 percent on Wednesday, after the jobless
claims data.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro soared against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday, edging toward the psychologically
important $1.40 level, after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet cemented expectations of a near-term
interest rate rise.
 In a press conference after the ECB left its benchmark rate
at 1.0 percent, Trichet said the bank will exercise ""strong
vigilance"" over rising inflation, a phrase that in the past
signaled a rate rise was only a month away.
 ""The market was expecting hawkish comments, but I think the
opening up of the door to a hike as early as the next meeting
is what's really propagated this, so you're seeing the euro
appreciate across the board,"" said Firas Askari, head of FX
trading at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""How sustainable this is is really a question mark. He did
say he's not expecting a series of rate hikes,"" he added. ""I'm
not a long-term buyer of the euro.""
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3976 on trading platform
EBS, its strongest level since early November after rising
above resistance around its 200-week moving average at $1.3958.
It last traded at $1.3939, up 0.6 percent on the day.
 Analysts said the euro is set to remain supported ahead of
the ECB's next meeting in early April, but they added that the
currency is likely to run into strong resistance in the $1.40
area and a rise above could attract fresh selling interest.
 ""I'm very alert right now for some potential
profit-taking,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster in New Jersey.
 Dolan added that Trichet's comments that the ECB would
carry on providing unlimited funding at its three-month
operations for the next three months also suggests ""there's
ongoing fragility in the European Banking sector.""
 A rise in interest rates would push up borrowing costs
across the 17-country euro zone, increasing the cost of funding
for highly indebted countries.
 Askari said it seems clear that the concern about inflation
in Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands outweighs the
worries in Trichet's mind about Spain, Portugal, Ireland and
Greece.
 ""When you look at the relative size of the economies, it
seems that he's making a call on the overall economic value of
Europe,"" Askari said.
 FED LAGGING
 The strong indication that a rise will come in April put
the ECB in pole position to hike well before the U.S. Federal
Reserve and even the Bank of England, which analysts had
expected to move first.
 The euro jumped as high as 114.97 yen on Reuters data. It
also rose 1 percent to 85.71 pence and was up 1.4 percent at
1.2979 Swiss francs.
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent to 82.46 yen, getting a lift
after data showed new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits
fell last week to their lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years.
A separate report showed the U.S. services sector grew at a
slightly faster pace in February to another five-year high.
 Some traders said the dollar could gain if U.S. nonfarm
payrolls data for February, due on Friday, comes in stronger
than expected, though the move is unlikely to gain traction as
the Fed remains committed to its stimulative monetary policy.
 ""The bottom line is that two out of the three major central
banks will soon start normalizing monetary policy,"" said
Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset
Management LLP in London, which oversees $900 million in
assets. ""With the Fed still firm on keeping rates low for long,
all this is likely to keep weighing on the U.S. dollar.""

 * Silver could rally further but too pricey for now
 
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The financial and geopolitical
backdrop has not deteriorated enough for gold to show off its
safe-haven credentials and it remains firmly a risk trade, while
the chance to get into silver may have passed, says HSBC.
 Charlie Morris, head of absolute return at HSBC Global Asset
Management, recently cut his exposure to gold.
 The firm has taken a defensive view of the world and
believes bullion is not the best way to profit from that stance,
even though though HSBC Global Asset Management is bullish
overall towards gold.
 Instead, he believes big-brand equities such as Wal-Mart or
Coca-Cola offer better protection against the risks facing the
global economy now.
 ""We're at a crossroads and it's a very complex time because
on the one hand, you want to protect yourself against inflation,
but those trades are extremely overcooked,"" he said.
 ""We love the stuff and we think it's the number one trade of
the decade. There might be other things that go up faster, maybe
it's food, maybe it's oil,"" he said.
 ""It has outperformed bear markets but it is a risk-on trade
and I think something needs to change before it becomes the
'flight-to-quality in a crisis' and I don't think we're at that
point yet,"" he said.
 HSBC Global Asset Management's Absolute Return Service has
about $2 billion under management.
 Gold hit a record $1,440.10 an ounce on Wednesday having
rallied by 10 percent since the outbreak of uprisings that have
swept the Arab world since late January triggered a fresh wave
of safe-haven buying.
 
 CHANGE OF VIEW
 The gold price came under pressure in the early weeks of the
year after investors grew more confident about the prospects for
economic recovery, robust corporate profits and rising interest
rates to prevent inflation from undermining growth.
 While silver is decidedly a hot trade, its stellar
performance against gold, with its ascent to 31-year highs,
might mean it is simply too hot to handle.
 ""I feel we ought to have some money in silver, but you add
it together and think about the risk-off thesis and we wouldn't
want to do it at this moment in time,"" he said.
 ""Not to say I think it's coming down, but I think we've
missed it. Buying something overbought and chasing it is rarely
a good strategy.""
 Silver, which rose by about 80 percent in 2010, making it
one of the top performing financial assets, is set for another
12 percent gain so far this year and is staging its strongest
performance versus gold in 13 years.
 The most recent data on U.S. silver future holdings shows
speculators have more exposure than they have done in four
months, compared to speculative holdings of gold futures, which
have risen but only to three-week highs.
 Meanwhile, another gauge of investor appetite for silver,
flows of metal into exchange-traded products, have registered a
net increase over the last month across the major ETPs. This
compares with a net decline for gold, in spite of the latter's
safe-haven status.
 But silver is also notoriously volatile. Last year, it swung
from losses of 13 percent to gains of 83 percent, compared with
the gold market's gyrations between losses of 5 percent and
gains of 31 percent.
 ""The higher the quality of your portfolio, the more you can
walk away from it,"" Morris said. ""If you're into things like
silver then you have to micromanage.""
 ""It's a racy little number, it's a speedboat, but it's not a
trade you can walk away from.""

 * Commodity FX not a hedge against higher oil prices
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The dollar could benefit in
coming months if political turmoil in Libya spreads to other key
oil exporters and accelerates the rise in crude prices to levels
that could derail global economic recovery.
 Analysts say sustained high oil prices could prompt
policymakers to focus on the negative impact of an oil shock on
domestic consumption and demand, shifting from their fixation on
the need to raise interest rates to ease inflationary pressures.
This could support the dollar, often a safe haven during
times of heightened economic and financial stress.
 Some analysts say oil prices may rise towards record highs
seen in 2008 if the rebellion in Libya spreads to Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest oil producer.
 Citi currency strategist Valentin Marinov said these worries
may prompt investors to pick up dollar-denominated assets,
slowing the diversification flows away from the U.S. currency
seen in past months.
 ""If push comes to shove and we see full-blown risk aversion
on geopolitical concerns, the diversification away from dollars
could come to a stop and we could see an uptick in demand for
Treasuries. We could see temporary dollar strength,"" he said.
 Brent crude has jumped more than 20 percent this year to
nearly $120 per barrel as a rebellion against Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi has disrupted oil supplies.
 The dollar's failure to gain from higher oil prices supports
the traditional, negative link between the two assets.
 But their 66-day rolling correlation could tighten if higher
oil prices trigger worries about global growth and spurs demand
for U.S. assets. The link strengthened in late 2008, after the
Lehman collapse spurred risk aversion, which boosted the dollar.
 
 ""If we have an oil spike between here and $150, it would be
largely inflationary, but at some point above $150 it would be
deflationary because it would stall global demand,"" said Stephen
Gallo, strategist at Schneider FX, adding the latter scenario
would trigger some safe-haven demand for the dollar.
 Marinov at Citi said dollar demand could pick up even before
oil hits an all-time high of $147, as the global economy is much
weaker than it was when prices were last at that level, making
the dollar more vulnerable to inflation-related economic shocks.

 IMPACT ON COMMODITY FX
 The dollar has fallen to a four-month low versus a currency
basket on expectations the Federal Reserve will lag other
central banks in raising interest rates. This would extend the
dollar's yield disadvantage to the euro, sterling and others.
 Some in the market say concern the U.S. central bank is not
doing enough to deal with inflation risks has largely excluded
the world's most liquid currency from the buying stampede that
often results when geopolitical concerns escalate.
 ""In the past six months the U.S. has expanded monetary
policy and fiscal policy into an inflation shock. That doesn't
really tick many boxes of a safe-haven currency,"" said Jonathan
Webb, currency strategist at Bache Commodities.
 Another black mark against the dollar is the ballooning U.S.
deficit, which could limit any possible upside.
 To some, the recent oil rally has underlined the need for
tighter Fed policy, but Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said his
focus is on growth and that higher oil prices are unlikely to
hurt the economy unless sustained.
 With the dollar's safe-haven status dented, investors
seeking to scale back exposure to risk have picked up the Swiss
franc and the yen.
 But even as the franc -- a traditional safe-haven currency
-- has soared to an all-time high versus the dollar, equities
have climbed since the start of the year, suggesting the MENA
issue has yet to chill overall risk demand.
 At the same time, currencies of oil exporters, including the
Canadian dollar and Norwegian crown, have rallied, despite their
tendency to suffer during periods of general risk aversion.
 Some analysts argue commodity-linked currencies, which also
include the Australian and New Zealand dollars, are not a
guaranteed hedge against higher oil prices, given their
performance following the past three major oil shocks.
 JPMorgan research shows the Australian and New Zealand
currencies fell versus the U.S. dollar in the year after the
1973 Yom Kippur war, the 1979 Iranian revolution and Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, after global growth deteriorated in
all three cases.
 The Canadian dollar rallied after 1973 and 1979, although
the U.S. recession which followed the 1990 shock ultimately
weakened the currency. The Norwegian crown only outperformed the
German mark after the Yom Kippur war.
 An eventual slide in commodity currencies is expected to
support the dollar, as could euro zone sovereign debt problems,
which could sting the euro, and economic weakness in the UK due
to government spending cuts.

 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped as weekly
jobless claims fell to their lowest in more than 2-1/2 years on
Thursday, while the euro rallied against the U.S. dollar as the
ECB president warned about inflation risks.
 Oil prices declined, also bolstering world stocks, after a
proposal by Venezuela President Hugo Chavez to try to broker a
peace deal in Libya.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
0.8 percent and, on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 156 points, or 1.3 percent.
 The euro soared after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank will exercise ""strong
vigilance"" over rising inflation, and may raise interest rates
as soon as next month. For Trichet's comments see
[ID:nLOOKCBANK]. Gold prices also fell on the comments.
 Oil jumped to approach 2-1/2-year highs on Wednesday as
violence escalated in oil producer Libya, but Brent crude oil
 eased on Thursday, and was last down $1.49 at $114.86 a
barrel.
 ""A peace plan would really be a great sign for markets,""

 Other U.S. data showed initial claims for U.S. state
unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest since May 2008, the

 That helped sentiment in U.S. stocks, with the labor market
still seen among the weakest areas of the U.S. economy.
Investors are anxiously awaiting the U.S.'s monthly payrolls

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro soared against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday, edging towards the psychologically
important $1.40 level, after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet cemented expectations of a near-term
interest rate rise.
 In a press conference after the ECB left its benchmark rate
at 1.0 percent, Trichet said the ECB will exercise ""strong
vigilance"" over rising inflation, deploying a phrase that in
the past signaled a rate rise was only a month away.
 For more on Trichet, see [ID:nLDE7221RF]
 ""It is crystal clear, from both the statement as well as
Trichet's remarks afterwards, that the ECB is prepared to raise
rates as early as next meeting,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior
currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 The euro rallied as high as $1.3976 , its
strongest level since early November after rising above
resistance around its 200-day moving average at $1.3958. It
last traded at $1.3933, up 0.5 percent on the day.
 Some analysts cautioned now that with the Trichet press
conference out of the way and the euro testing the key $1.3950
and $1.40 resistance area, profit-taking may set in, which
could see the euro stabilize in the $1.38 and $1.3850 area.
 ""A lot of people were expecting a hawkish statement from
Trichet and he's delivered everything that the hawks had been
looking for. I'm very alert right now for some potential
profit-taking,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster in New Jersey.
 He added that Trichet's comments that the ECB would carry
on providing unlimited funding at its three-month operations
for the next three months, also suggests ""there's ongoing
fragility in the European Banking sector.""
 Against the yen, the euro jumped to a session peak of
114.83 yen on Reuters data , before pulling back
slightly to trade at 114.78 yen, up 1.1 percent on the day.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.31 yen , getting
a lift after data showed new U.S. claims for unemployment
benefits fell last week to their lowest level in more than
2-1/2 years. See [ID:nOAT004756]

 By Paul Carrel and Terhi Kinnunen
 FRANKFURT/HELSINKI, March 3 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank said on Thursday it could soon raise interest rates,
heightening concerns about the implications for struggling euro
zone countries as EU leaders strive to find a solution.
 If the central bank were to raise interest rates to stem
inflation, possibly as early as next month, it would push up the
costs of borrowing across the 17-country euro zone, increasing
the cost of funding for highly indebted countries such as
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and others on the euro zone periphery.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet was explicit in a news
conference after the bank decided to keep interest rates on hold
at a record low 1.0 percent saying: ""An increase in interest
rates at the next meeting is possible.""
 Analysts said they were concerned about the ramifications of
a rate rise for countries such as Ireland, which is already
frustrated by the high rate of interest being charged on its
EU/IMF bailout loans, which stands at around 5.8 percent.
 ""We believe the risks assigned to such a decision are high
in a context of the periphery situation remaining under stress,""
said Jacques Cailloux of RBS European Economics.
 Trichet did say a series of rate rises was not on the cards,
limiting damage to the likes of Portugal, widely regarded as the
euro state most likely to need emergency EU/IMF assistance next,
following in the footsteps of Greece and Ireland.
 A succesful bond issue by Spain on Thursday suggests it is
under considerably less threat, though markets could still turn
their fire in its direction if Portugal succumbs.
 
 HELSINKI MEETING
 Centre-right EU leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel
and Ireland's prime minister-elect Enda Kenny, will meet in
Helsinki on Friday.
 The gathering has been called to try to forge agreement on a
""comprehensive package"" of measures that EU leaders hope will
draw a line under their year-long debt crisis. They are aiming
to agree the full package at a summit on March 24/25.
 But Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen, who called the
meeting, said Ireland wanted to discuss the costs of its
bailout, and that was also likely to be on the agenda.
 ""The issue will probably be raised,"" Katainen said.
 ""We must look at the big picture and review what is
Ireland's debt sustainability level. The essential thing is that
Ireland can pay back its debt."" 
 Merkel said on Wednesday that if Ireland had problems with
the interest rate it was an issue she would consider, but said
Dublin could not presume to pay less for its rescue loans than.

 ""We cannot artificially reduce interest rates. Ireland and
Greece have taken aid,"" she said, adding that Ireland's package,
agreed in November, was only a few months old.
 Kenny, keen to show voters he is tackling the EU over the
cost of the 85 billion euro bailout, said he would not hold
back.
 ""Obviously we'll be dealing with that in Helsinki,"" he told
Reuters on Thursday when asked what steps he would be taking to
try to secure a lower interest rate on the loans.
 ""We made our position very clear to President Barroso and
the chancellor,"" he said, referring to Jose Manuel Barroso, the
head of the European Commission, and Merkel.
 
 PREPARATORY MEETING
 Friday's gathering in Helsinki will not produce any formal
decisions but is expected to shape thinking ahead of a summit of
heads of state from the 17 euro zone countries on March 11.
 That meeting will discuss economic governance, with France
and Germany intent on having the rest of the euro zone sign up
to a ""competitiveness pact"", and may touch on the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro rescue
fund set up in May last year and used to bail out Ireland.
 Because of guarantees built into the EFSF to maintain its
triple-A credit rating and allow it to raise money more cheaply
on international markets, the facility only has an effective
lending capacity of around 250 billion euros.
 The European Commission and many euro zone member states
want the threshold raised to the full 440 billion euros, but
Germany's backing is needed and Berlin is reluctant.
 Katainen said competitiveness -- including issues such as
countries agreeing legal limits on the size of their deficits,
gradually raising retirement ages and agreeing a common
corporate tax base -- would be discussed on Friday.
 ""For us it is important that, whatever we do, the whole EU
area will have common rules, this cannot become an
inter-government exercise driven by large countries,"" he said.
 
 SPAIN SELLS BONDS BUT AT A COST
 While Ireland is intent on securing a better deal on its
bailout, EU policymakers are increasingly concerned about
Portugal which is seen as likely to need a bailout as soon as
April.
 A euro zone source told Reuters on Thursday it was ""only a
matter of time"" before Portugal needed assistance and said
Lisbon was only managing to sell bonds at auction thanks to
buying from Portuguese pension funds and some foreign buyers.
 Spain, another potential recipient of EU aid if the
contagion were to spread beyond Portugal, held a successful
auction of three- and five-year bonds on Thursday, which helped
lift some of the gloom in financial markets.
 The Treasury easily sold a total of 3.8 billion of 2014 and
2016 dated bonds, but the yields were around 35 basis points
higher than at the last auction of similar bonds on Feb. 3.
 ""What it really tends to reinforce ... is that there's been
a very distinct dissociation between Spain and Portugal,
particularly over the last three or four weeks and this really
underscores that,"" said Marc Ostwald, strategist at Monument
Securities. ""But one wonders how durable this is going to be.""

 Some analysts cautioned now that with Trichet out of the

 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped more than
1.0 percent on opening as weekly jobless claims dropped to
their lowest in more than 2-1/2 years on Thursday, while the
euro rallied against the U.S. dollar after the ECB president
warned about inflation risks.
 Oil prices dipped, also bolstering world stocks, after a
proposal by Venezuela President Hugo Chavez to try to broker a
peace deal in Libya. World stocks as measured by MSCI
<.MIWD00000PUS> were up 1.0 percent and on Wall Street the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 150 points shortly after the
open.
 The euro soared after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said inflationary risks are to the upside
and ""strong vigilance"" is required. The word ""vigilance"" in
previous tightening cycles usually suggested a near-term rate
hike. For Trichet's comments see [ID:nLOOKCBANK].
 Oil jumped to approach 2-1/2-year highs on Wednesday as
violence escalated in oil producer Libya. Brent crude oil
 was down $1.74 at $114.61 a barrel.
Investors worry that political instability could spread to
major oil producer Saudi Arabia, a central U.S. ally in the
region, and other oil suppliers.
 In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average

 By Luciana Lopez and Silvio Cascione
 SAO PAULO, March 3 (Reuters) - Brazil's economy grew at its
fastest pace in 24 years in 2010, gaining steam at the end of
the year on buoyant consumer demand while industry struggled to
cope with a strong currency.
 Last year's 7.5 percent expansion, not far behind growth
rates in China and India, is likely as good as it gets for
Latin America's largest economy for some time as higher
interest rates and tighter public spending cool domestic demand
and slow growth to a more sustainable pace in 2011.
 The rapid growth, driven by record-low unemployment and a
confident new middle class of free-spending consumers, crowned
the presidency of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who bowed out last
year with an approval rating just shy of 90 percent.
 But the tax breaks and loose spending that helped boost the
economy left a fiscal mess for Lula's hand-picked successor,
Dilma Rousseff, now grappling with inflation above 6 percent.
 ""We're cutting the budget now because, for us, controlling
inflation is one of the most important matters,"" Rousseff told
reporters in Brasilia on Thursday.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Brazil's economic growth: http://r.reuters.com/tux38r
 Latin American currencies: http://r.reuters.com/sux38r
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ""The 7.5 rate deserves our praise, but we're always going
to be looking for a reasonable growth rate, 4.5 to 5 percent,
which is sustainable and permanent,"" she said.
 That's about the growth rate that Brazil will see this
year, according to Finance Minister Guido Mantega, who said
still robust domestic demand and investment would continue to
drive the economy in 2011.
 The full-year expansion compares with 10.3 percent growth
in China last year and expected growth of around 8 percent in
India, highlighting the strength of emerging economies compared
to their still-struggling European and U.S. counterparts.
 But Brazil's maddening bureaucracy, complex tax code and
severe infrastructure woes make such a clip unsustainable.
 The economy, which rebounded from a 0.6 percent contraction
in 2009, grew 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 from
the same period a year earlier, in line with expectations.
 Household consumption, which has been a main pillar of
Brazil's economic boom in recent years, rose a brisk 2.5
percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months as
Brazilians continued to brandish their wallets.
 Armed with credit cards and rising wages, new members of
the middle class are buying cars in record numbers and taking
their first-ever foreign vacations. Restaurant seating in Sao
Paulo, the country's largest city, often spills over onto
sidewalks as families skip eating at home.
 But industrial output dropped 0.3 percent, highlighting the
burden of a strong currency  on business, while
agriculture in a global breadbasket slipped 0.8 percent.
 ""The bigger concern is that it's a two-speed growth story:
consumers remained the key driver of growth and exporters are
lagging behind in this recovery,"" said Neil Shearing, an
economist at Capital Economics in London.
 FINDING BALANCE
 Some analysts call this year's growth estimates too rosy,
given about $30 billion in pledged public spending cuts, higher
interest rates and tighter bank reserve requirements.
 ""Growth last year was mostly concentrated in the first
quarter, with a strong carry-over,"" said Mauricio Rosal, Latin
American economist at Raymond James in Sao Paulo.
 ""Growth will be a lot lower this year, maybe half of what
we saw last year,"" he added.
 Rousseff has pledged to cut spending heavily to ease demand
pressures in the world's 8th biggest economy. Meanwhile, the
central bank hiked interest rates for the second time in three
months on Wednesday, raising the benchmark rate to 11.75
percent from 11.25 percent. [ID:nN01145534]
 Economists expect more rate hikes given that annual
inflation, at 6.08 percent, is running above the government
target of 4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.
 Benchmark inflation data on Friday will likely confirm that
outlook. The 0.85 percent median forecast in a Reuters poll
would be the biggest calendar-month jump since April 2005.
 Yields on longer-dated interest rate futures contracts
<0#DIJ:> rose on Thursday as investors priced in higher
borrowing costs in coming years.
 The economy expanded 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter when
compared to the previous quarter, falling just short of the 0.9
percent median forecast of 20 analysts polled by Reuters.
 Capital spending, a gauge of investment, rose 0.7 percent
on a quarter-on-quarter basis and a whopping 21.8 percent for
all of 2010. The central bank said that figure indicates that
businesses are confident in Brazil's economic outlook in the
coming years. [ID:nSAQ002605]

 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, March 3 (Reuters) - Differences between the world's
central bankers over inflation and the causes of global
imbalances will be in the spotlight on Friday when they gather
in Paris to discuss regulation in the wake of the crisis.
 Top monetary policymakers from the United States, the euro
zone, China, Japan and several emerging countries will join
academics and businessmen under the banner of France's G20
presidency to debate topics including President Nicolas
Sarkozy's call to reduce global reliance on the dollar.
 Two weeks after G20 finance ministers said in Paris they
would seek new safeguards by November to reduce the risks posed
by big banks, bankers will discuss the challenges for financial
surveillance and coordination. The session will be chaired by
Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, who is leading the G20
initiative.
 Other topics will include reform of the international
monetary system, the role of central banks after the crisis, and
a session, chaired by outgoing Bundesbank Governor Axel Weber,
on global economic imbalances in the wake of the crisis.
 But with the U.S. Federal Reserve sounding calm about rising
food and energy prices and the European Central Bank striking a
more hawkish tone, market attention will focus on hints of when
policymakers will start to tighten the credit taps.
 ""There is more distinction between the Fed and the ECB's
attitudes to inflation than ever before,"" said Ken Wattret,
chief euro zone economist at BNP Paribas.
 ""The market is pricing in a Fed rate rise soon after the
ECB, but the Fed seems to be saying that's unlikely.""
 Markets will watch Thursday's ECB governing council meeting
for any suggestion it could bring forward an expected interest
rate rise to as soon as this summer, despite fears this could
deliver a blow to fragile housing markets in Spain and Ireland.
 Draghi -- one of a batch of euro zone policymakers including
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet due at Friday's talks -- said
last week rate setters must watch inflation pressures to prevent
them passing to wages.
 In contrast, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke this week dampened
expectations the central bank might withdraw from its easy money
policies by saying that a recent surge in oil prices would have
a ""temporary and relatively modest"" impact on consumer prices.
 At their meeting last month G20 finance ministers outlined a
list of indicators to gauge imbalances, but China's reluctance
to include exchange rates and reserves meant the terms of the
final accord were watered down. [ID:nLDE71K0Q5].
 ""One thing is talking about global imbalances, but another
is doing something about them,"" said Wattret. ""I don't see much
evidence these imbalances are getting any better.""
 
 CHINA DRAGGING ITS FEET
 China will be represented on Friday by deputy central bank
governor Hu Xiaolian. It, and other emerging nations, may repeat
criticism of a second round of so-called quantitative easing in
the United States for inundating their economies with hot money
which they blame for stoking inflation and asset bubbles.
 An IMF report last month said data had not borne that out so
far and indicated slow growth was keeping wage pressures and
second-round effects from fuel price rises in check.
 China and other Asian and Latin American economies are
resisting pressure, meanwhile, from Washington and Europe to
tighten monetary policy to curb signs of overheating in their
economies and allow their currencies to appreciate.
 Friday's highest-profile panel features the ECB's Trichet,
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, Fed Vice Chair Janet
Yellen and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, discussing
reform of the international monetary system.
 Other invitees to Friday's meeting include the governors of
the central banks of France, Italy, Korea and Japan, Cyprus and
Chile, the IMF's chief economist Olivier Blanchard and EU
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
four-month high and a key resistance area against the dollar on
Thursday, supported by expectations that the European Central
Bank is set to pave the way for rate rises later in the year.
 Investors have pushed the euro up about 3 percent from a low
hit on Feb. 14 on the view that ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet,
who speaks at 1330 after the bank ends a policy-setting meeting,
will sharpen his anti-inflation rhetoric as oil prices continue
to soar.
 Some market players think the bank will switch three-month
liquidity operations back to capped-limit, variable rate tenders
-- a largely symbolic step in the phasing out of crisis support
that could also help clear the way for a rate hike.
 ""Trichet should keep a hawkish tone today as data in the
euro zone has continued to improve,"" said Manuel Oliveri,
currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 ""Better manufacturing and labour market conditions, together
with rising commodity prices, are increasing the risks of second
round effects. This should keep the euro supported.""
 The euro was flat against the dollar at $1.3868 ,
hovering near a four-month peak of $1.3890 hit on trading
platform EBS on Wednesday. It triggered short-term downside
stop-losses through $1.3840 in the European morning but traders
said persistent Middle-East demand kept the currency well
cushioned.
 It was within sight of the 76.4 percent retracement of its
fall from November to January at $1.3947, as well as its
200-week moving average at $1.3959. The euro has traded below
the 200-week since mid-November.
 Options traders reported Asian offers ahead of $1.3900
option barriers, with more significant option structures
highlighted at $1.3950, said to be expiring March 10.
 Some traders said there is a risk the euro could slip after
the ECB meeting since many market players are already counting
on the central bank to send strong signals that it will raise
rates to counter inflation.
 Data showed last week that speculators' long positions in
the euro have soared to their highest since mid-October,
pointing to the risk of profit-taking.
 However accounts with a longer-term perspective,
particularly those who rely on computer-generated trading
signals, were being forced to buy the euro given its recent
appreciation.
 ""Topside in euro/dollar is more painful to the medium-term
market, and the system accounts will have to continue to buy,""
said a London-based spot trader.
 
 OIL IMPACT
 Market players said the currency's outlook in the longer
term also hinges on where oil prices are going, as the dollar
comes under pressure from rising oil prices.
 Many investors believe that higher oil prices will push
central banks to raise interest rates to combat inflation but
that the Federal Reserve is likely to lag the ECB and others,
maintaining broadly stimulative policy to support growth.
 The dollar index was steady on the day at 76.691 <.DXY>,
near a four-month low of 76.529 hit on Wednesday. Trendline
support connecting its record trough and its 2010 low lies in
the 76.15-25 area.
 The U.S. currency also hit a one-month low of 81.57 yen on
Wednesday, though thick bids around 81.50 yen were likely to
limit further losses in the near-term.
 The Swiss franc, traditionally sought in times of heightened
geopolitical tension, slipped after an Al Jazeera report that
Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and the president of the Arab League had
agreed to a peace plan fronted by Venezuela's president, Hugo
Chavez. [ID:nN02289530]
 Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa later told Reuters
the plan was ""under consideration"". [ID:nLDE72203U]
 The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 0.9253 franc ,
pulling away from a record low of 0.9202 hit on EBS on
Wednesday.

 LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - A proposal by Venezuela
President Hugo Chavez to try to broker a peace deal in Libya
briefly pushed oil lower on Thursday, while recently risk-averse
stock markets put in gains.
 Wall Street looked set to open higher and shares in Europe
and Asia gained as the oil price eased, and on upbeat U.S.
economic data overnight.
 The euro currency and yields on euro zone government debt
shot higher, meanwhile, as European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet warned about inflation, raising the
likelihood of an interest rate rise later this year.
 Brent crude oil fell as low as $113.09 a barrel but was
later back up above $114 on reports of continued fighting in
Libya, including air strikes against rebel positions.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.5 percent.
 The sharpest moves in oil were prompted by Chavez, a friend
of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, suggesting a commission from
Latin America, Europe and the Middle East could be formed to try
to reach a negotiated outcome to the Libyan crisis, which has
driven oil to levels that may threaten the global recovery.
 Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said his group was
considering the proposal.
 Some oil analysts suggested the proposal was a convenient
excuse for traders to adjust their positions.
 ""If it's coming out of Chavez, it might not have a great
degree of substance,"" said Tim Riddell, head of technical
analysis at ANZ in Singapore.
 ""The fact that the markets have been so volatile, and
without having concrete evidence of any material shift in the
unrest in the Arab world, suggests to me that we are at best
consolidating.""
 Financial markets have nonetheless become highly sensitive
to the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East because of
the broad impact that a rising oil price has on everything from
corporate profits to consumer confidence and interest rate
projections.
 STOCKS RISE
 European shares rose on Thursday, buoyed by positive U.S.
economic news overnight and the falling oil price.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares was up
0.9 percent, recovering the previous session's 0.7 percent fall.
 Forecast-beating U.S. private sector jobs data and positive
comments from the Federal Reserve in its latest Beige Book
report overnight helped support equities in both the United
States and Asia.
 ""(There is) some hope that the global recovery is strong
enough to weather any shocks that may arise due to uncertainties
in the Middle East,"" said Zahid Mahmood, senior dealer at
Capital Spreads.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3935, its highest since early
November, after Trichet said the outlook for prices was on the
upside. Investors had already pushed the euro up about 3 percent
from a low hit on Feb. 14.
 Short-term euro zone government bond yields traded at their
highest since June 2009 on the prospect of an interest rate hike
as early as July.
 A smooth bond auction by Spain, which remains under pressure
in financial markets on uncertainty over whether Europe can
solve its debt crisis, offered markets a small positive signal.

 * Dependent banks need plan to cure ECB over-reliance
 * ECB would only buy non-govt assets if specific problems
 
 (Adds quotes, background)
 By Marc Jones
 FRANKFURT, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro zone money market is
polarised with banks in peripheral euro zone countries still
dependent on the European Central Bank for liquidity, the ECB's
head of market operations Francesco Papadia said on Thursday.
 Papadia, who oversees the ECB's crisis strategy and
controversial government bond purchase programme, said the money
market remained split between banks who have access to open
markets and those who do not.
 ""When I try to summarise the situation in the money market
in one word, the word I use is 'polarisation',"" Papadia said at
a Euromoney conference, stressing it was his personal view
rather than that of the ECB.
 ""Banks on aggregate are asking for much less liquidity than
they were before... at the other pole some banks, particularly
in the so-called peripheral countries of the euro area, continue
to crucially depend for their liquidity on the European Central
Bank.""
 The ECB is set to announce later on Thursday whether it
feels the time is right to start withdrawing its crisis support
measures having been forced to put the process on hold late last
year by the euro zone debt crisis.
 A Reuters poll on Tuesday showed money market experts were
evenly split over whether the bank would resume its so-called
exit strategy by switching its 3-month lending operations back
to capped-limit, competitive auctions, or wait a little longer.
 
 LIQUIDITY BRIDGE
 Borrowing from the ECB  has dropped by 100
billion euros since the start of the year, drastically reducing
the amount of excess cash that has long bloated and distorted
markets.
 It has pushed interbank rates   back in
the directions of more normal levels, although there has been
sharp fluctuations as banks have taken advantage of the ECB's 1
percent, limit-free lending when market rates have climbed.
 Papadia said the swings needed to be taken into account.
 ""It is not obvious that the volatility in rates... has
become such an overwhelming problem to really raise acute
concerns but the issue needs to be checked and controlled.""
 He urged reliant banks to come up with ways to end their
dependency on the ECB, calling national governments to take
action where necessary.
 Using a metaphor, he fired a warning that the ECB did not
want to keep its liquidity support in place indefinitely.
 ""Bridges are something that helps pass an obstacle. Bridges
cannot have an indefinite length.""
 He added that the ECB was highly unlikely to resurrect its
covered bond purchase programme that ended last year or buy any
other commercial assets.
 ""There would need to be a special reason to do that (buy
non-government assets). There would have to be something very
specific there.""

 * Feb surveys again show price pressures surging
 * Employment growth improves, although still subdued
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro zone's services economy
enjoyed its fastest upturn since August 2007 in February, albeit
one marked by fast-rising inflationary pressures and a subdued
labour market, business surveys showed on Thursday.
 The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI) rose to 56.8 in February from 55.9 the previous month,
revised slightly lower from a preliminary reading of 57.2 but
still its best showing since the euro zone exited recession.
 February marked the 18th month the services PMI, which
measures the activities of companies ranging from banks to
hotels, has been above the 50 mark dividing growth from
contraction.
 While the survey showed signs of improvement in struggling
economies like Spain and Ireland, it provided further evidence
that the recent energy and commodities price boom is starting to
trickle down to consumers.
 ""Rates charged by services providers showed a worrying
upturn, registering the largest monthly increase since July
2008,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist of survey compiler
Markit.
 ""Hotels & restaurants and transport & travel companies saw
particularly steep price hikes, seeking to pass higher food and
fuel prices on to customers.""
 Prices charged by euro zone service sector firms rose for
only the second time in 28 months, with that component of the
survey leaping to 52.8 in February from 49.8 in January.
 Euro zone inflation jumped to 2.4 percent in February,
following a series of statements last month from European
Central Bank policymakers reaffirming their commitment to
maintaining price stability.
 The PMI showed input price growth rose to its highest since
September 2008. Still, Markit reported few signs of second-round
inflation effects emerging in the form of wage hikes, in part
due to the subdued state of the euro zone labour market.
 ""While disappointing in many respects, the weak employment
picture may at least serve to allay worries about second-round
inflationary pressures, with persistent high unemployment
dampening employees' wage bargaining powers,"" said Williamson.
 
 PERIPHERY PICKUP
 PMI surveys of individual countries published earlier on
Thursday showed German services growth remaining at very high
levels in February, if slightly slower than January. In Spain,
the service sector grew for the first time in six months.
 The composite PMI, a broader measure of the private sector
which combines the services data with Tuesday's strong
manufacturing sector data, rose to 58.2 in February from 57.0
the previous month -- its best showing since July 2006.
 The composite PMI also showed surging price pressures,
although its employment component rose to 53.3 -- up from 52.1
in February and its best showing since February 2008.
 Overall, Markit's Chris Williamson said the data suggest the
euro zone economy is growing at around a quarterly rate of 0.8
percent in the first quarter, with some promising signs in the
debt-laden periphery.
 ""However, national growth divergences look likely to persist
for some time, as accommodative monetary policy looks set to
continue to support above-trend growth in France and Germany but
will be offset to some extent by deficit-fighting austerity
measures in the periphery,"" he added.
 Economists polled by Reuters last month predicted first
quarter growth of 0.3 percent for the euro zone economy, and
little improvement in quarters thereafter.

 * Needs to help Chinese exporters cope with rising costs
 * Says China should limit annual yuan rise to 3-5 percent
 By Kevin Yao and Shen Yan
 BEIJING, March 3 (Reuters) - The loose monetary policy in the
United States is little better than ""a narcotic"" and will harm
the rest of the world more than it helps Americans, a former
Chinese vice commerce minister told Reuters.
 Wei Jianguo, now head of a top think tank, joined the ranks
of Chinese officials blaming the Federal Reserve's quantitative
easing for flooding the developing world with easy money and
fuelling inflation.
 ""It's hurting others and not even benefiting itself,"" he
said. ""Quantitative easing is a narcotic, an amphetamine, a smoke
bomb. The fundamental problems of the economy have just been
covered up,"" Wei, chief of the China Center for International
Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), said in an interview.
 Despite China's vocal criticism of the Fed's planned $600
billion bond-buying stimulus, it has continued to invest vast
amounts of its wealth in dollar assets. China held $1.16 trillion
of U.S. government debt at the end of last year, $268.4 billion
more than previously thought, the U.S. Treasury Department said
on Monday. [ID:nN28290882]
 China itself has faced plenty of foreign anger over its
economic policies, particularly its tightly controlled exchange
rate, which many say keeps its exports cheap and fuels its hefty
trade surplus.
 Wei said China needed to be sensitive to these concerns, but
that the best way to cut its trade surplus was to increase
imports, not raise the yuan's exchange rate.
 ""How to reduce China's trade surplus and resolve its trade
frictions with other countries? We must boost imports,"" Wei said.
 Beijing must make a fundamental overhaul of trade policy to
spur imports and buy not just raw materials but everything from
Swiss watches and French cosmetics to meet growing domestic
demand for luxury goods, he said.
 ""LOSING FRIENDS""
 China was under pressure not just from rich countries, but
also developing countries to cut its trade surplus, he added.
 ""We have been running trade surpluses with some developing
countries for a long time and they are complaining. If the trend
persists, we will lose our friends,"" he said.
 That change is coming, he said, predicting that China's trade
surplus would narrow to about $100 billion this year from $183
billion in 2010.
 Chinese exports increased 31.3 percent in 2010 as global
demand recovered, but its imports rose even quicker, up 38.7
percent on the back of its voracious appetite for oil, iron ore
and other commodities.
 But China should not let its currency rise sharply as many
exporting companies were already struggling to cope with rising
labour and raw materials costs, he said.
 ""The yuan will continue to appreciate. Based on my
discussions with exporters, the upper limit for yuan appreciation
that they can cope with is 3-5 percent a year,"" Wei said.
 China has let the yuan  gain about 3.9 percent
against the dollar since it was depegged in June 2010. Economists
polled by Reuters think China will let the yuan rise 5.4 percent
this year.
 World leaders have been trying to tackle the global economic
imbalances that exacerbated and, some say, helped trigger the
financial crisis in 2008, with China's yawning trade surplus seen
as one of the chief problems.
 China would cut import tariffs and red tape to boost imports
this year and ""maintain balanced trade"", China's vice minister of
commerce Zhong Shan said in comments published on Thursday.

 * Report of Venezuela-brokered Libya peace plan dents CHF
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
four-month high against the dollar on Thursday on expectations
the European Central Bank will move towards an eventual rate
hike, though the currency faces a near-term risk of
profit-taking.
 The Swiss franc, traditionally sought in times of heightened
geopolitical tension, fell after news network Al Jazeera said
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and the president of the Arab
League had agreed to a peace plan from Venezuela's president,
Hugo Chavez, to end the crisis in Libya. [ID:nN02289530]
Oil  and gold  slid following the report, while
the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield  and the Australian
dollar rose to their intraday highs. 
 Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa later told Reuters
a peace plan proposed by Venezuela's Chavez to end the crisis in
Libya was ""under consideration"". [ID:nLDE72203U]
 The euro rose 0.3 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.2843
, while the dollar edged up 0.3 percent to 0.9260
franc , pulling away from a record low of 0.9202 hit on
EBS on Wednesday.
 The euro inched up 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.3874
, hovering near a four-month peak of $1.3890 hit on
trading platform EBS on Wednesday.
 Some traders said there is a risk the euro could slip after
an ECB meeting on Thursday, since many market players are
already counting on the central bank to send strong signals that
it will raise rates to counter inflation.
 Investors have pushed the euro up about 3 percent from a low
hit on Feb. 14 in anticipation that ECB chief Jean-Claude
Trichet will sharpen the central bank's anti-inflation rhetoric
as oil prices continue to soar.
 Some market players think the bank will stop supplying
three-month liquidity in the second quarter, switching the
operations back to capped-limit, variable rate tenders -- a step
in the phasing out of crisis support that could lead to a rate
hike.
 But others see the chance of the bank extending the measure
in light of lingering worries about bank funding in some euro
zone periphery countries -- an outcome that could push back
market expectations of a rate rise.
 ""I think the euro rally will fizzle after the ECB today.
There has been a lot of hype in the market on the ECB for some
time, so I expect the euro to lose steam pretty much regardless
of what the ECB does today,"" said Teppei Ino, currency analyst
at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 While oscillators such as the RSI do not point to
overheating in the euro's rally now, data showed last week that
speculators' long positions in the euro have soared to their
highest level since mid-October, pointing to the risk of
profit-taking.
 Immediate resistance for the euro is seen at $1.3900, where
it has option-related offers. Further resistance includes
$1.3947, around the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's fall
from November to January, and $1.3958, the 200-week moving
average.
 OIL IMPACT
 But market players also said the currency's outlook in the
longer term hinges on where oil prices are going, as the U.S.
currency comes under pressure from rising oil prices.
 ""If U.S. crude prices hit $110 and Brent oil prices hit
$120, I'm sure the euro will be above $1.40,"" said Makoto Noji,
senior FX strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.
 A trader at a Japanese bank also said persistent buying by
Middle Eastern players has recently supported the euro.
 ""As oil prices are soaring, they probably have more
petrodollars to diversify,"" the trader said.
 The dollar has come under pressure because many investors
believe that higher oil prices will push other central banks to
raise interest rates to combat inflation even as the Federal
Reserve maintains its stimulative monetary policy.
 Traders also took a cue from that fact that the dollar had a
negative correlation with oil prices when oil prices jumped in
2007-2008.
 The dollar index was steady on the day at 76.670 <.DXY>,
near a four-month low of 76.529 hit on Wednesday.
 The dollar now sits near a trendline connecting its 2008
record low and its 2009 low.
 ""I would expect some buybacks in the dollar at such a level
but we haven't seen much short-covering, which suggests
sentiment on the dollar is really weak,"" the Japanese bank
trader said.
 Another, and perhaps more crucial, trendline support
connecting the record low for the dollar index and its 2010 low
lies at the 76.15-25 area.
 The U.S. currency also hit a one-month low of 81.57 yen on
Wednesday, though thick bids around 81.50 yen, possibly
option-related, helped to push it back to 81.89 yen ,
little changed from late U.S. trading on Wednesday.

 * Threatens to derail government fiscal efforts
 * Movement boosted by failure to prosecute corruption
 
 By Ingrid Melander and Angeliki Koutantou
 ATHENS, March 3 (Reuters) - A movement more insidious than
crippling strikes or anarchist fire bombings is threatening to
undermine Greece's efforts to escape a debt crisis shaking the
euro zone.
 The ""I don't pay"" movement -- a sullen form of uncivil
disobedience -- is beginning to starve the government of vital
revenue from transport and public services as it struggles to
plug a giant budget hole.
 Fed up with wage cuts and tax hikes while corrupt
politicians seen as responsible for the crisis enjoy impunity,
more and more Greeks are refusing to pay for road tolls, bus
tickets and other public charges.
 ""It's not easy to take to the streets holding a Molotov
cocktail, but it's easy to say I won't pay,"" pollster Costas
Panagopoulos said. ""The 'I don't pay' movement is now the main
risk for the government.""
 The ruling Socialists must show within months that tax
evaders and those who profited from past corruption are being
punished if they want to contain the movement, he said.
 The political and legal system grants politicians almost
blanket immunity from prosecution, and efforts to fight tax
evasion have been slow to show results.
 Despite tough austerity measures, social unrest has so far
been more subdued than expected as the majority of Greeks have
grudgingly accepted that some sacrifices are necessary.
 But growing numbers of people are choosing to show their
anger by refusing to pay for highways, public transport and
state TV licence fees.
 More than 56 percent of Greeks approve of this kind of
protest compared to 39 percent who don't, according to an MRB
poll published in a Sunday newspaper.
 Launched as a fringe disobedience movement by residents
living near the Afidnai toll gate on a main highway into Athens,
the 'I don't pay' action group initially only dodged road tolls.
 But it has gathered support from leftist groups and gained
momentum since recent rises in public transport fares and now
claims more than 10,000 registered members.
 
 GROWING MOVEMENT
 Its website http://denplirono.wordpress.com has more than
82,000 hits. The site calls on people not to validate tickets
and offers instructions on how not to pay tolls -- politely
asking collectors to lift the barrier.
 ""We want free roads,"" said Vassilis Papadopoulos, 59, an
ophthalmologist who drives 60 km (38 miles) on a toll road every
day but has not paid a single euro in the last year and a half.
 ""We are not willing to suffer the results of mismanagement,
corruption and the crisis of a system we never chose,"" he said.
""It would have cost me at least 2,000 euros ($2,777) a year only
in toll fees to go to work.""
 Local communities have also opposed higher tolls, saying
most of the roads are partially completed and offer poor
services. [ID:nLDE70D1S8] In January, the mayor of the town of
Stylida in central Greece had bulldozers remove barriers
stopping locals from using a side road to avoid tolls.
 Operators who raised tolls last year in line with concession
contracts signed in 2007, say toll-dodging drivers jumped from
about 6 percent to 15-18 percent in less than a year.
 And it is not only tolls. In a bid to reform loss-making
public transport and help plug its fiscal shortfall, the
government also raised fares last month.
 The price of a ticket valid for 90 minutes on urban
transport jumped to 1.40 euros from 1 euro.
 ""1.40 euros a ticket? It's a 40 percent rise when all else
went down -- wages, pensions, minimum benefits,"" said Maro
Fassea, 48, an IT consultant, who joined hundreds of 'I don't
pay' protesters outside parliament on Tuesday. ""We've paid for
our public transport and roads 100 times over through taxes.""
 
 PROJECTS THREATENED
 Refusal to pay is threatening not only public finances but
also an 8.7 billion euro road expansion programme that the
recession-hit country badly needs to pull itself out of the
crisis and attract new investment.
 About 2.9 billion euros of state and private funds have
poured into the toll roads so far, but operators say revenue
losses could blow up the projects, already plagued by court
wrangles and a suspension of bank funding. [ID:nLDE7172DM]
 ""We are talking about 8,000 users a day who don't pay,"" said
Fani Lambrou, spokeswoman for Nea Odos, a company which operates
a 172 km highway in central Greece. This means minimum daily
losses of 16,000 euros.
 The rising movement has prompted Greek Prime Minister George
Papandreou to warn that any road project cancellation would be a
major blow to the country.
 ""If the contracts default, which is a possibility, our
country's credibility will be damaged,"" he told parliament.
""They will say that we do not honour our signature.""
 As it gains ground, the movement may also hurt government
efforts to get people and businesses to pay their taxes, a
crucial part of efforts to put finances back on track.
 ""The 'I won't pay' movement draws strength from the fact
that the political system is unable to prosecute any of the
corrupt politicians of the past decades,"" said Yanis Varoufakis,
professor of economics at the University of Athens.
 ""The movement is likely to grow,"" he added. ""As the crisis
deepens, its momentum will be boosted and, as a result, the
government's tax collection efforts will falter.""

 * Palm oil export duty review decision due soon
 * Non-oil exports seen jumping 12-15 pct to over $12
bln/month
 * South-south trade booming and changing regional dynamic

 By Fitri Wulandari and David Fox	
 JAKARTA, March 3 (Reuters) - Indonesia will not import more
rice in coming months as stockpiles are now sufficient and
expectations high for increased local production, trade minister
Mari Pangestu said, offering relief in its fight against food
inflation. 
 In an exclusive interview with Reuters, she said the
government would soon announce results of a review on the
current export tax system on palm oil products that seeks to
encourage more downstream investment while controlling domestic
cooking oil prices.	
 The minister, a petite 55 year-old with a PhD in
International trade from the University of California ,
also revealed that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) plus Japan, South Korea and China would this year likely
finalise a pact for a regional ""rice bank"" to protect against
the food price hikes seen recently -- and more severely in 2008.	
 
 Ample regional supplies and reduced prospects of buying from
Indonesia -- which surprised markets with bumper rice imports in
January -- could further ease pressure for a grain that has
lagged a rally in other commodities and bring some breather for
countries grappling with inflation. 
 ""The amount of Bulog's imports is sufficient, Pangestu said,
referring to the state procurement agency, adding the situation
would be reviewed ""as is normal"" in August.	
 Indonesia has allowed Bulog to import rice since September
to maintain a 1.5 million-tonne stockpile after failing to
secure local supplies when domestic prices surged above 5,060
rupiah per kg (about $0.60 per kg).	
 Bulog maintains the stockpile to ensure the government can
provide free or subsidised rice for millions of poor families
and during disasters such as floods, quakes and tsunamis.	
 Indonesia in January suspended import duties on rice,
soybeans and wheat as part of moves to fight food inflation. The
measures may have worked, as raw food prices fell 0.3 percent in
February from the previous month -- the first in four years --
leading overall inflation to ease, data showed. 
 Raw food prices were still up 14.8 percent last month on a
year ago. Protests over higher prices were seen as a major
factor in the ousting of autocratic ruler Suharto in 1998, and
investor fears over inflation led to a sell-off in Indonesian
stocks and bond in January.	
 Pressed for her view on rice prices, Pangestu said: ""Prices
continued to be high until around January but in February
started to come down. Certainly for February it came down by
about 3 percent and it will come down a little bit more in March
as it is also the beginning of harvest."" 
 
 RICE FOR THE POOR	
 According to the 2011 state budget, the government plans to
spend 15.3 trillion rupiah ($1.7 billion) to distribute 3.15
million tonnes of subsidised rice for 17.5 million poor families
-- higher than 13.9 trillion rupiah spent last year.	
 Indonesia has applied tight rice trade rules since 2004 and
imports of the politically sensitive grain are not allowed
during harvests to avoid pressure on local farmers. ""There is no
plan to change it (policy) at the moment,"" Pangestu said.	
 The main harvest runs from March to May/June, followed by a
smaller one in August-September. Indonesia aims to be
self-sufficient in rice production, a position attained in the
early 1980s but lost as farmland was turned into housing estates
for the booming population and rampant smuggling pressured
growers.	
 The statistics bureau's first crop forecast for the year of
67.31 million tonnes of unmilled rice was below the agriculture
minister's December projection for 68.8 million tonnes in 2011,
but up from 66.41 million tonnes in 2010. This will lead to a
4.29 million-tonne surplus this year, in line with government
aims for a 10 million-tonne surplus in 5-10
years.

 PALM OIL TAX ON REVISION	
 Pangestu said the government was reviewing an export duty on
palm oil, although she insisted it wasn't as widely unpopular as
made out.	
 ""Some investors who want to invest in the downstream sector
want this. That's why we need to review export duties,"" she
said.	
 ""It'll still be a progressive tax, but where you start and
how much and how do you do it is still being discussed,"" she
said, adding the government will announce the decision soon.	
 Under the system, Indonesia uses the average spot CPO price
in Rotterdam, Europe's vegetable oils market, during the
preceding month as a reference price to decide the following
month's palm oil tax rates. The world's top palm producer
charges a minimum tax of 1.5 percent on crude palm oil exports
if the reference price stands at $701-$750 a tonne and maximum
25 percent if the price rises above $1,250.	
 While the downstream palm oil sector for food products has
seen rising demand from a growing population and higher food
prices, the downstream sector for non-food palm products such as
oleo chemicals and biodiesel has been progressing more slowly.	
 Indonesia is struggling to increase its capacity to absorb
its palm oil output which is expected to reach 22 million tonnes
this year, partly because of slow progress in implementation of
plans for mandatory biodiesel usage for transportation.	
 
 ROBUST TRADE	
 Pangestu said Indonesia's trade balance was currently ""very
robust"" and non-oil/gas exports should grow 12-15 percent this
year to average more than $12 billion a month. Indonesia had a
trade trade surplus of $1.91 billion in January. 
 ""What's happening there's continuous volume increase in non
commodities-based exports such as textile, garments, footwear
and electronic products,"" she said.	
 Much of this, she said, had to do with recent implementation
of free-trade agreements that has seen significant increases in
exports to non-traditional markets -- particularly so-called
""south-south"" trade, such as that to ASEAN nations, which had
doubled in the past five years.	
 ""This partly reflects the regional-based story -- where you
import components and then produce a particular type of product
and then export your final product back to them,"" she said.	
 ""The increase in purchasing power in all the countries in
Asia is driving trades between us. The share of our trade that
is being accounted for by emerging markets is about 30-40
percent, that's like almost doubling say 5-8 years ago.""

(Adds oil reaction to Arab League comment on Libya plan)	
 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, March 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped on Thursday
as the Arab League said a peace plan for Libya put forward by
Venezuela's Hugo Chavez was under consideration, while upbeat
U.S. economic news helped lift Asian stock markets.	
 U.S. stock index futures were firmer, pointing
to a higher opening on Wall Street, which eked out small gains
on Wednesday.	
 Brent crude futures fell more than $3 a barrel to an
intraday low of $113.09 after the head of the Arab League said a
peace plan for Libya, proposed by Chavez, was under
consideration.	
 However, Brent quickly retraced some of the losses to stand
at $114.67, down 1.4 percent on the day.	
 ""We have been informed of President Chavez's plan but it is
still under consideration,"" Amr Moussa, the secretary-general of
the Arab League, told Reuters by telephone on Thursday.	
 ""We consulted several leaders yesterday,"" he said, without
providing a deadline to decide on the plan. 
 When asked if Muammar Gaddafi had accepted the plan, Moussa
said: ""I don't know, how am I supposed to know that?""	
 In answer to a question on whether he had agreed to the
Chavez plan, Moussa said: ""No.""	
 U.S. crude fell 1.2 percent to $101, after hitting a
high of $102.94.	
 News of the plan comes as Gaddafi's Libyan army faced an
increasingly organised and confident rebel force which is
appealing for international support and looking to take its
military successes west towards the capital Tripoli.	
 Oil investors are concerned that growing instability in
Middle East oil producers if public protests against incumbent
leaders spread, could threaten global supplies. 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts argue the oil shock
from Libya ranks as the eighth largest supply shock since 1950.	
 ""The stability of the region has gone through a major shock
and the ripples are going to be felt for a while,"" said Carl
Larry, president of Oil Outlooks and Opinions based in Houston.	
 Gold, often sought in times of heightened geopolitical
tensions and as an inflation hedge, slipped to around $1,424 an
ounce , down from a record high just above $1,440.	
 
 Tokyo's Nikkei average closed 0.9 percent higher, a
day after it suffered its biggest fall this year, while stocks
elsewhere in Asia were 1 percent firmer.	
 ""It's too early to be optimistic because concerns about
rising oil prices will likely persist,"" Masumi Yamamoto, a
market analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets, cautioned.	
 ""But investors might have oversold yesterday, so they may
buy back stocks with good fundamentals.""	
 South Korea's KOSPI , which plumbed a three-month low
on Wednesday, was among the best performers in the region,
advancing 2.2 percent on the day.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was modestly higher,
while the Shanghai Composite Index was slightly lower.	
 Wall Street eked out small gains on Wednesday with the S&P
500 index ending 0.2 percent higher after the Federal
Reserve's Beige Book suggested economic activity picked up in
2011 and a private survey pointed to strong private-sector
hiring. 
 The private-sector jobs report bodes well for the
influential non-farm payrolls data due on Friday.	
 
 EURO PINS HOPES ON ECB	
 In the currency market, the euro held its ground against the
dollar after rallying to near four-month highs. The single
currency is expected to stay supported ahead of the European
Central Bank policy meeting.	
 Markets expect the ECB to sharpen its anti-inflation
rhetoric, reinforcing views the ECB will raise interest rates
before the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
 The euro last traded at $1.3866 , having climbed as
high as $1.3890. The dollar index , which tracks its
performance against a basket of major currencies, was little
changed on the day at 76.69. It fell to 76.529 overnight, its
lowest level since early November 2010.	
 Still, some analysts warn the rally in the euro will
probably fizzle after the ECB meeting.	
 ""There has been a lot of hype in the market on the ECB for
some time, so I expect the euro to lose steam pretty much
regardless of what the ECB does today,"" said Teppei Ino,
currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

 By Simon Rabinovitch	
 TIANJIN, China, March 3 (Reuters) - Yujiapu does not roll
off the tongue like Wall Street, but planners in the northern
Chinese port city of Tianjin hope it soon will.	
 Round-the-clock construction is transforming muddy ground
into what officials boast will be the world's largest financial
zone a decade from now.	
 It's a monument to the ambitions driving China's economic
growth and to the sort of risks leaders in Beijing see piling up
alongside the country's new skyscrapers.	
 When they gather for their annual parliament in Beijing
starting on Saturday, they will endorse plans to tap the brakes
on the economy, a slowdown to keep inflation and debt -- both
rising but under control -- from becoming far more troublesome.	
 But they only need make the one-hour trip to the financial
district sprouting up in Tianjin to see how hard-driving local
officials, pliant state-owned banks and the soaring aspirations
of people seeking a better life are thwarting their designs for
slower, steadier growth.	
 A forest of cranes and the foundations of 12 buildings, the
first phase of Yujiapu, rise from the land where Li Guowang once
lived. The steelworker's home was destroyed to make way for the
development and he was moved to a government-built high-rise
compound last year, though without the bitterness that often
accompanies such relocations in China.	
 ""If anything, I'd say the new financial zone is too small --
the entire city should be like it,"" he said, playing with his
young daughter in the snowy plaza at the foot of his apartment.	
 ""Hopefully, it will be like a strong light bulb, a single
point that will brighten up the rest of the room.""	
 Yet even Li had doubts about how a financial centre housing
up to 120 buildings, if all goes according to plan, could
produce anything to rival his employer, the Tianjin Pipe
Corporation.	
 ""What exactly they will do there, I'm not sure. It's not
like steel, which you can see and touch. I guess they'll be able
to hold lots of business meetings,"" he said.	
 
 
 CHINA'S FASTEST	
 Although not about to supplant Shanghai, home of China's
main stock exchange, Tianjin has been racing to hone its
credentials as a financial hub. In the past three years alone,
it has opened the Bohai Commodity Exchange, the Binhai
International Equity Exchange, the Tianjin Climate Exchange and
the Tianjin Ferroalloy Exchange.	
 Tianjin's economy grew 17.4 percent last year, the fastest
of China's 31 provincial-level areas. While that would have been
cause for celebration in the past, the local government has been
modest in trumpeting its achievement.	
 ""It has been a historic breakthrough,"" said Tang Zhongfu, a
director on Tianjin Binhai's Development and Reform Commission,
a powerful planning agency in the city.	
 ""But we still have to address problems, like the
relationship between current growth and long-term growth,"" he
added.	
 Over their eight years in power, President Hu Jintao and
Premier Wen Jiabao have vowed to steer officials away from the
blind pursuit of growth, instead advocating what they term
""scientific development"".	
 Fuzzy as it sounds, the concept is well understood in China
to mean a more sustainable economic model: slower industrial
investment, less pollution and a fairer distribution of income.	
 During the National People's Congress this month, China will
unveil a detailed policy blueprint for the coming five years. Hu
and Wen will try to enshrine their agenda by setting an official
goal of 7 percent annual growth from now until 2015, well down
from the 11.2 percent average of the past five years.	
 The last five-year plan had, in fact, pencilled in 7.5
percent growth, so the figure is better viewed as the lowest
tolerable expansion rate rather than a binding requirement.
Still, it will be a powerful expression of their desire for
healthier development.	
 But that is easier said than done. Not a single one of
China's 31 provincial-level governments has signed up to the
lower growth target. Most want something far higher. Tianjin,
for one, is shooting for 12 percent.	
 ""It's quite clear that the central government will not be
able to realise its goal,"" said Yang Zhiyong, an economist in
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government
think-tank.	
 Outsiders often assume that Beijing is omnipotent in
governing China, bending far-flung cities and villages to its
will. The reality is different.	
 A centralised tax system has left local governments strapped
for cash. By promoting fast growth, they look to get proceeds
from land sales to fill the gap.	
 ""You have a problem. Healthcare reform, pensions, public
housing -- they all need money,"" Yang said. ""But if I don't have
money, how can I accomplish the tasks set for me by the central
government?""	
 The problem runs even deeper, said Victor Shih, an expert on
elite Chinese politics at Northwestern University in the United
States. The central government is divided between multiple
factions and none wants to take an unpopular stand against
growth, especially as they jockey for position ahead of a major
leadership reshuffle in late 2012, he said.	
 ""No one in the central government wants to end the party,
even at a time of high inflation,"" Shih said. ""That leaves a lot
of room at the local level to carry on and to try to achieve
local objectives like investment-driven growth.""	
 
 ""THE NEXT SHANGHAI""	
 From his desk stacked with papers and volumes of statistics,
Tang, the planner in Tianjin, reeled off staggering numbers that
appeared almost conservative against the scene outside his
window, a patchwork of construction sites and new buildings
stretching into the distance.	
 The economic output of Binhai, the district in Tianjin where
the Yujiapu financial zone will be based, more than doubled over
the past five years and the government is targeting the same in
the next five. Binhai's population of 2.48 million will more
than double by 2020.	
 Global investors have cast a worried eye over China's ghost
towns, new sections of cities from Ordos in the north to Guiyang
in the south with vast apartment blocks and few people. But
Tianjin is a reminder that what seems to be excessive investment
doesn't always equal waste in the world's second-largest
economy.	
 About 75 miles (120 kms) from Beijing, a high-speed train
puts more than 30 million people within half an hour of
Tianjin's downtown.	
 Its port is already the fourth-busiest in the world. And an
enviable list of foreign firms has set up factories in the
Binhai district: Airbus , Toyota and Motorola
, to name a few.	
 The rationale for more offices, more factories, more
apartments and more highways is clear. The question is whether
it is all too much and happening too quickly.	
 ""Everybody wants to be the next Shanghai, so everybody wants
to expand faster than their neighbours,"" Qu Hongbin, HSBC's
chief economist for China.	
 That description is certainly apt in Tianjin. The municipal
government views the Binhai district, anchored by the Yujiapu
financial zone, as its answer to Shanghai's Pudong, a rural
patch of land before 1990 that has been built into the country's
financial hub today. Driven by huge construction spending,
Binhai's GDP topped Pudong's last year for the first time.	
 Tianjin has also set its sights on Guangzhou. While Shanghai
and Beijing are unrivalled as the country's two biggest cities,
Tianjin, the sixth largest, will surpass the southern metropolis
as China's third city in a few years on its current trajectory.	
 In its plan for the next five years, Guangzhou gave a rare
glimpse into the race to the top that is fuellin"

 * Some market players think room for disappointment
 * Middle Eastern buying supporting euro
 * Dollar broadly weak as oil prices near 2-½ year peaks
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
four-month high against the dollar on Thursday on expectations
the European Central Bank will move towards an eventual rate
hike, though the currency faces a near-term risk of
profit-taking.
 With many market players already counting on the central
bank to send strong signals that it will raise rates to counter
inflation, there is a risk the euro will slip after an ECB
meeting on Thursday, some traders said.
 Investors have pushed the euro up about 3 percent from a low
hit on Feb. 14 in anticipation that ECB chief Jean-Claude
Trichet will sharpen the central bank's anti-inflation rhetoric
as oil prices continue to soar.
 Some market players think the bank will stop supplying
three-month liquidity in the second quarter, switching the
operations back to capped-limit, variable rate tenders -- a step
in the phasing out of crisis support that could lead to a rate
hike.
 But others see the chance of the bank extending the measure
in light of lingering worries about bank funding in some euro
zone periphery countries -- an outcome that could push back
market expectations of a rate rise.
 ""I think the euro rally will fizzle after the ECB today.
There has been a lot of hype in the market on the ECB for some
time, so I expect the euro to lose steam pretty much regardless
of what the ECB does today,"" said Teppei Ino, currency analyst
at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 While oscillators such as the RSI do not point to
overheating in the euro's rally now, data showed last week that
speculators' long positions in the euro have soared to their
highest level since mid-October, pointing to the risk of
profit-taking.
 Last month the euro's rally peaked at $1.3862 as Trichet
disappointed bulls by not offering new hints of earlier
tightening after the last policy meeting.
 On Wednesday, the euro finally broke above that level to hit
a four-month high of $1.3890. It last stood at $1.3858 ,
down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Wednesday.
 Immediate resistance is seen at $1.3900, where it has
option-related offers. Further resistance includes $1.3947,
around the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's fall from
November to January, and $1.3958, the 200-week moving average.
 OIL IMPACT
 But market players also said the currency's outlook in the
longer term hinges on where oil prices are going, as the U.S.
currency comes under pressure from rising oil prices.
 ""If U.S. crude prices hit $110 and Brent oil prices hit
$120, I'm sure the euro will be above $1.40,"" said Makoto Noji,
senior FX strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities.
 A trader at a Japanese bank also said persistent buying by
Middle Eastern players has recently supported the euro.
 ""As oil prices are soaring, they probably have more
petrodollars to diversify,"" the trader said.
 The dollar has come under pressure because many investors
believe that higher oil prices will push other central banks to
raise interest rates to combat inflation even as the Federal
Reserve maintains its stimulative monetary policy.
 Traders also took a cue from that fact that the dollar had a
negative correlation with oil prices when oil prices jumped in
2007-2008.
 The dollar index was steady on the day at 76.704 <.DXY>,
having dropped to a four-month low of 76.529 on Wednesday.
 That drop in the dollar index had come on a day when oil
prices hit their highest settlement price in 2-½ years
as Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi launched a land and air
offensive to retake territory in Libya's east, fighting against
rebels near an oil export terminal.
 The dollar now sits near a trendline connecting its 2008
record low and its 2009 low.
 ""I would expect some buybacks in the dollar at such a level
but we haven't seen much short-covering, which suggests
sentiment on the dollar is really weak,"" the Japanese bank
trader said.
 Another, and perhaps more crucial, trendline support
connecting the record low for the dollar index and its 2010 low
lies at the 76.15-25 area.
 Escalating tension in north Africa helped to push the Swiss
franc to a record high of 0.9202 franc per dollar  on
Wednesday. The dollar last fetched 0.9247 franc, up 0.1 percent
from late U.S. trade on Wednesday.
 The U.S. currency also hit a one-month low of 81.57 yen on
Wednesday, though thick bids around 81.50 yen, possibly
option-related, helped to push it back to 81.85 yen .

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, March 3 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices held near 2-1/2
year peaks on Thursday as worries about supply disruption
persisted given ongoing unrest in Libya, but upbeat U.S.
economic news and a firmer Wall Street helped Asian stocks post
modest gains. 
 Both U.S. crude and Brent crude prices edged up as Libyan
rebels repulsed a land and air offensive by Muammar Gaddafi's
forces and the defiant leader warned foreign powers of ""another
Vietnam"" if they intervened. 
 Gold, often sought in times of heightened geopolitical
tensions and as an inflation hedge, traded at $1,431.85 an ounce
, within striking distance of the record high of
$1,440.10.	
 
 Tokyo's Nikkei average rose 0.5 percent, while
stocks elsewhere in Asia gained 0.3 percent.
South Korea's KOSPI advanced 1.4 percent, while
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index was little changed.

 U.S. crude last traded at $102.62 a barrel, not far
from the recent peak at $103.41, while Brent crude was
at $116.58, closing in on the $119.79 high.	
 Wall Street eked out small gains on Wednesday with the S&P
500 index edging up 0.2 percent came after the Federal
Reserve's Beige Book suggested economic activity picked up in
2011 and a private survey pointed to strong private-sector
hiring. 
 The private-sector hiring report bodes well for the
influential non-farm payrolls data due on Friday. 
 In the currency market, the euro was a touch softer after
rallying to near four-month highs against the dollar. The single
currency, however, is expected to stay supported ahead of the
European Central Bank policy meeting.	
 Markets are wary the ECB will sharpen its anti-inflation
rhetoric, reinforcing views the ECB will raise interest rates
before the U.S. Federal Reserve.	
 The euro last traded at $1.3852 , having climbed as
high as $1.3890. The dollar index , which tracks its
performance against a basket of major currencies, was little
changed on the day at 76.708, just off the overnight low of
76.529, its lowest since early November 2010.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices rose
on Wednesday as news of an airstrike in Libya near an oil
terminal spurred supply worries, while investors' flight to
safety drove gold to a record high.
 World stocks dipped, while Wall Street stocks advanced.
U.S. economic data, including a Federal Reserve report saying
the U.S. economy has slowly gained strength this year, helped
to offset worries that higher oil prices will dampen growth.
 Oil prices jumped to approach 2-1/2-year highs on news that
airstrikes hit Brega about 1.2 miles (about 2 kilometers) from
a Libyan oil terminal, after Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
launched land and air offensives to retake territory in Libya's
eastern region.
 Investors are worried that political instability could
spread to major oil producer Saudi Arabia, a central U.S. ally
in the region, and other oil suppliers.
 ""The (stock) market is slowly adjusting to the new
environment (of high oil prices) and beginning to realize that
there is no short-term solution to this, that we are going to
live with this uncertainty for a some time,"" said Robert Lutts,
chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management in Salem,
Massachusetts.
 At its intraday peak, Brent crude for April delivery traded
at $117.81 a barrel. For details, see [ID:nLDE721009]
 Gold  climbed to an all-time record at $1,440.10 an
ounce. The metal has rallied 10 percent since late January when
tensions first began to flare in the Middle East and Africa.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.2
percent and was off about 2 percent from a 30-month peak set in
February. The index is still up about 3.5 percent since the
start of the year.
 U.S. stocks rose after the Fed's Beige Book showed the U.S.
economy was slowly gaining strength in 2011. The Fed noted that
manufacturers and retailers had been able to increase some of
their prices. [ID:nN02253289]
 Data showed U.S. private-sector employers added more jobs
than expected last month, which investors saw as a positive
sign ahead of the more closely watched U.S. government's
monthly jobs report, due on Friday.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 8.78 points,
or 0.07 percent, to settle at 12,066.80. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 2.11 points, or 0.16 percent, to end at
1,308.44. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> advanced 10.66
points, or 0.39 percent, to settle at 2,748.07.
 The day's rally was broad, with eight out of 10 S&P 500
sectors ending higher. Sectors sensitive to energy gained,
including industrials <.GSPI>, up 0.4 percent, and materials
<.GSPS>, up 0.2 percent. An index representing the S&P
infotechnology sector <.GSPT> rose 0.5 percent.
 DANCE OF OIL, DOLLAR AND STOCKS
 As investors made their flight-to-safety bids, the dollar
fell to a record low against the Swiss franc. U.S. Treasury
debt prices declined.
 ""There is still a lot of risk aversion. I think the big
focus right now is what's going on with the Middle East, North
Africa and oil,"" said Igor Cashyn, interest rate strategist at
Morgan Stanley in New York.
 Equities have had a strong inverse relationship with oil in
the past several weeks on concerns that rising prices could
slow economic growth.
 For a graph of equities correlation to oil, see

 ""There is an increasingly strong correlation between
equities and oil,"" said John Brady, senior vice president at MF
Global in Chicago.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
slid 0.7 percent to close at 1,153.73 on fears that
skyrocketing oil prices could drastically curb or halt growth.
 SAUDI ARABIA ON OUR MINDS
 Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched a major offensive
against rebels in eastern Libya, sparking a rebel warning that
foreign military help might be needed to ""put the nail in his
coffin"" and end Gaddafi's long rule. [ID:nLDE721009]
 Saudi Arabia's stock markets declined for a 13th session
and hit a 22-month low, while Dubai equities fell to a
6-1/2-year low, reflecting investors' worries over planned
protests in Saudi Arabia.
 Saudi Arabia's benchmark stock index <.TASI> fell nearly 4
percent at one point to a fresh 22-month low.
 Brent crude for April delivery  rose 93 cents to
settle at $116.35 a barrel on Wednesday -- the highest
settlement since Aug. 21, 2008.
 U.S. crude for April delivery  jumped $2.60 to settle
on Wednesday at $102.23 a barrel, the highest since front-month
crude ended at $106.89 on Sept. 26, 2008.
 EYES ON EUROPEAN RATES AND U.S. JOBS
 The Swiss franc soared to a record high versus the dollar
.
 The euro  climbed as high as $1.3890 on trading
platform EBS, its strongest level since Nov. 9, with investors
looking ahead to the European Central Bank's policy-setting
meeting on Thursday. The expectation is growing that interest
rates will rise in Europe before doing so in the United
States.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 21/32, its yield at 3.47 percent, up from 3.40 percent on
Tuesday. The economic news helped to overshadow turmoil in
oil-producing regions.
 Economists polled by Reuters forecast Friday's nonfarm
payrolls report for February will show a rise in private-
sector payrolls of 190,000 and a rise of 185,000 in overall
nonfarm payrolls.

(Updates prices)
 NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a near
four-month high against the dollar on Wednesday and looked set
to extend gains on growing expectations interest rates in the
euro zone will rise earlier than those in the United States.
 The Swiss franc soared to a record high against the dollar
as escalating tensions in Libya and fears of contagion to other
oil-rich countries, especially Saudi Arabia, prompted investors
to seek safety in the Swiss currency. For details, see
[ID:nLDE721009]
 The European Central Bank holds its policy meeting on
Thursday. With oil prices trading above $100 a barrel 
 and euro zone inflation well above target, investors
expect the ECB to sharpen its anti-inflation rhetoric.
 After struggling in recent sessions to break above
resistance at $1.3862, its previous 2011 high, the euro pierced
that level as North American trading got underway.
 The euro could make a run toward $1.40 should post-meeting
comments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet reinforce
expectations of an interest rate hike, analysts said.
 ""The perception is growing in the market that the ECB will
certainly be hiking rates sooner than the Fed and that has
really underpinned the euro for the time being,"" said Greg
Salvaggio, senior vice president of capital markets at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 The euro  climbed as high as $1.3890 on trading
platform EBS, its strongest level since Nov. 9. It last traded
at $1.3869, up 0.7 percent on the day.
 Euro zone producer prices rose in January at the fastest
rate in the history of the single currency, data showed on
Wednesday, highlighting the risk that the ECB may raise rates
sooner than expected. [ID:nLDE7210ZT]
 Traders reported option-related offers ahead of $1.39.
Further upside targets include $1.3947, around the 76.4 percent
retracement of the euro's fall from November to January, and
$1.3958, the 200-week moving average.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback against
a basket of major currencies, fell to as low as 76.529, its
lowest since early November 2010.
 EURO AS SAFE-HAVEN
 The U.S. currency has been unable to benefit from the
recent spike in risk aversion amid political tensions in the
Middle East and North Africa, prompting some investors to
question whether the dollar has lost its safe-haven status.
 ""People are starting to view the euro as a counter to the
dollar in times of turmoil simply because they both offer equal
security. However, the euro is offering higher yields,""
Salvaggio said.
 The dollar has come under pressure as investors focused on
the view that higher oil prices would push other central banks
to raise interest rates to combat inflation even as the Federal
Reserve maintains its stimulative monetary policy.
 Investors also fret that rising energy costs could hurt
U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of
the U.S. economy.
 However, some analysts said if tensions escalate, concerns
about the impact of soaring oil prices on the global economy
could sour investor appetite for risk and help the dollar
regain its safe-haven status.
 ""If there is no resolution to the crisis in the Middle
East, oil prices will stay elevated and people will stop
focusing on the inflationary impact. The euro is in favor now
but in two to three weeks it could be the dollar,"" said Simon
Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 The dollar was little changed at 81.89 yen , after
falling as low as 81.57 yen on EBS, a near one-month low. The
greenback hit an all-time low of 0.9202 Swiss franc on EBS and
was last down 0.5 percent at 0.9237 .
 Some traders said the dollar could get a respite if U.S.
non-farm payrolls jobs data for February, due on Friday, comes
in stronger than expected, bolstering the case for the Federal
Reserve to wind down its $600 billion bond-buying program.
 U.S. private-sector employers added more jobs than expected
last month, data showed on Wednesday. [ID:nN02213101]

 PARIS, March 2 (Reuters) - South Africa backs France's goals
for its presidency of the Group of 20 economies, President Jacob
Zuma said on Wednesday, stressing that failure to address issues
like food price swings would hit the poor hardest.
 Zuma is on a two-day visit to France at the invitation of
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has sought South African backing
for a G20 agenda that includes reforming the global monetary
system and reducing instability in commodity markets.
""We support France's emphasis on the issues of commodity
prices, food security and the future of the International
Monetary System,"" he told a news conference on Wednesday.
 ""If not addressed properly, these unresolved problems could
lead to further instability in the world economy and could do
severe damage to the condition of the poor worldwide.""
 South Africa is the newest member of the BRICS, a group of
fast-growing emerging economies including Brazil, Russia, China
and India, and has already expressed reservations over a
proposed financial transaction tax.
 But France, which holds the presidency of the G20 until
November, has underlined that the two countries have agreed to
work on these issues.
 France is also one of several countries courting South
Africa as it shops the world for a multi-billion dollar nuclear
power plant that could help it avoid an electricity crunch.
 French nuclear company Areva signed an agreement during
Sarkozy's 2008 state visit to South Africa to boost nuclear
skills development in the only African country with a nuclear
power plant.
 South Africa has the continent's biggest economy.

 NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a near
four-month high against the dollar on Wednesday and looked set
to extend gains on growing expectations interest rates in the
euro zone will rise earlier than those in the United States.
 The Swiss franc soared to a record high versus the dollar
as escalating tensions in Libya and fears of contagion to other

 The European Central Bank holds its policy meeting on
Thursday. With oil prices trading above $100 a barrel 
 and euro zone inflation well above target, investors
expect the ECB to sharpen its anti-inflation rhetoric.
 After struggling in recent sessions to break above
resistance at $1.3862, its previous 2011 high, the euro pierced
that level as North American trading got underway.
 The euro could make a run toward $1.40 should post-meeting
comments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet reinforce
expectations of an interest rate hike, analysts said.
 ""The perception is growing in the market that the ECB will
certainly be hiking rates sooner than the Fed and that's really
underpinned the euro for the time being,"" said Greg Salvaggio,
senior vice president of capital markets at Tempus Consulting
in Washington.
 The euro  climbed as high as $1.3890 on trading
platform EBS, its strongest level since Nov. 9. It last traded
at $1.3865, up 0.6 percent on the day.
 Euro zone producer prices rose in January at the fastest
rate in the history of the single currency, data showed on
Wednesday, highlighting the risk that the ECB may raise rates

 Traders reported option-related offers ahead of $1.39.
Further upside targets include $1.3947, around the 76.4 percent
retracement of the euro's fall from November to January, and
$1.3958, the 200-week moving average.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback versus
a basket of major currencies, fell as low as 76.529, its lowest
since early November.
 EURO AS SAFE-HAVEN
 The U.S. currency has been unable to benefit from the
recent spike in risk aversion amid political tensions in the
Middle East and North Africa, prompting some investors to
question whether the dollar has lost its safe-haven status.
 ""People are starting to view the euro as a counter to the
dollar in times of turmoil simply because they both offer equal
security. However, the euro is offering higher yields,""
Salvaggio said.
 The dollar has come under pressure as investors focused on
the view that higher oil prices would push other central banks
to raise interest rates to battle inflation even as the Federal
Reserve maintains its stimulative monetary policy.
 Investors also fret that rising energy costs could hurt
U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of
the U.S. economy.
 However, some analysts said if tensions escalate, concerns
about the impact of soaring oil prices on the global economy
could sour investor appetite for risk and help the dollar
regain its safe-haven status.
 ""If there is no resolution to the crisis in the Middle
East, oil prices will stay elevated and people will stop
focusing on the inflationary impact. The euro is in favor now
but in two to three weeks it could be the dollar,"" said Simon
Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 81.72 yen , after
falling as low as 81.57 yen on EBS, a near one-month low.
 The greenback hit an all-time low of 0.9202 Swiss franc on
EBS and was last down 0.6 percent at 0.9226 .
 Some traders said the dollar could get a respite if U.S.
non-farm payrolls jobs data for February, due on Friday, comes
in stronger than expected, bolstering the case for the Federal
Reserve to wind down its $600 billion bond-buying program. U.S.
private-sector employers added more jobs than expected last
month, data showed on Wednesday. [ID:nN02213101]

 By Silvia Aloisi
 TUNIS, March 2 (Reuters) - Food stocks are depleted and
supply chains disrupted in Libya, the United Nations' World Food
Programme (WFP) said on Wednesday, calling for urgent
humanitarian aid to the country hit by political unrest.
 Responding to the critical situation in North Africa, the
WFP is launching a $39 million emergency operation to provide
food assistance to 2.7 million people in Libya, Egypt and
Tunisia, it said in a statement.
""We call for safe humanitarian access, especially to western
Libya,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said in a
statement, after visiting the Libyan-Tunisian border on Tuesday.
 ""Cutting off food supplies must not be used as a weapon,""
she said.
 Under its contingency plans, the WFP has re-routed shipments
of wheat and flour to the Tunisian border and the Libyan port of
Benghazi.
 ""We are planning for a three-month emergency operation that
will help shore up Egyptian and Tunisian food safety nets and
will also purchase food from the region to help ensure that
recovery from the disruption can begin immediately,"" she said.
Thousands of migrant workers desperate to leave Libya are
stranded at the border with Tunisia, sleeping in the open and
getting little if any assistance.
Meanwhile, WFP says it is also worried about the food
situation within the country.
 ""People arriving at the crossing are reporting that food
availability varies from town to town. Food is scarce in some
parts of the country,"" WFP spokeswoman Abeer Etefa said by phone
from the border.
 Food shortages were reported in Zawiyah, a city 50 km west
of Tripoli held by rebels but surrounded by pro-Gaddafi forces,
where some refugees said the price of bread had gone up 20
percent.Libya relies on imports for over 90 percent of its
food.
""It's clear that the turmoil and the fact that roads are not
safe are putting pressure on food suplies,"" Etefa said.
 The WFP dispatched a team to Benghazi on Wednesday to check
if the port was safe for food deliveries and inspect the food
supply situation there.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2011 11:56AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Inflation, weak leu hit Romania rate cut prospects"," * C.bank seen less likely to cut rates despite consensus
 * High imported inflation, weak leu may prompt tightening
 * Leu currency underperforms its peers
 
 By Luiza Ilie
 BUCHAREST, March 2 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank may
confound expectations of a cut in interest rates this year as it
struggles with imported inflation and, alone in central Europe,
a currency that has not benefited from an emerging market boom.
 A Reuters poll last month showed analysts forecasting rate
cuts later this year as the impact on prices of a value-added
tax hike fades and Romania prepares to sign a new precautionary
aid deal with the International Monetary Fund.
 The deal is a mark of the progress Romania has made since it
was bailed out in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and
should ease concerns over the fate of its currency that have
weighed on the bank's decision to keep rates high since May.
 But with growth still weak, the budget under pressure and
the economy facing a surge in oil prices as well as reforms of
local energy markets that will prod prices higher, there seems
little prospect that the leu will jump or inflation will ease.
 January inflation came in higher than expected at 7 percent,
the highest in the European Union, and some analysts are already
swinging round to forecast interest rates either on hold at the
current 6.25 percent this year or even conceivably rising.
 ""The central bank will not cut rates this year. In fact,
there are upside risks for a hike,"" said ING Bank Romania chief
economist Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc. ""I find it hard to
believe we will not have imported inflation.""
 
 WAITING GAME
 While most analysts say they will wait for more signals from
policymakers before revising their estimates, they acknowledge
inflationary risks have picked up and some say there is a chance
the bank may have to raise rates in late 2011 to protect its 2-4
percent inflation goals for this year and next.
 Alternatively, the bank could freeze rates and favour a
stronger leu, either via indirect intervention or by gradually
tightening liquidity, boosting money market rates.
 Either, however, would nudge five-year debt yields up from
current levels of around 7.2 percent, increasing the
government's borrowing costs, while holding back an already slow
economic recovery -- 2011 growth is seen at just 1.5 percent.
 Forecasts for domestic demand in 2011 are barely more
positive and any rise in borrowing costs will be deeply
unpopular with a population reeling from two years of draconian
budget cuts in the EU's poorest country by per capita income.
 ""Risks are higher but ... in light of recent developments we
are waiting for a message from the central bank,"" said Ionut
Dumitru, chief economist at Raiffeisen Bank in Bucharest.
 
 FOREX RISE
 Currency gains have allowed other European central banks to
keep rates low even as their economies recovered strongly from
the 2008 crisis, but Poland and Hungary have already raised
rates and the Czech Republic is expected to follow. 
 While the leu has held stable against the euro at levels
similar to June 2010, the Polish zloty is up 3 percent since
then and the Czech crown 5 percent.
 As for mitigating higher commodities costs, usually priced
in dollars, the Polish zloty has gained 17 percent against the
dollar since June and the Czech crown 19 percent -- whereas the
leu's rise is around 12 percent and inflation is correspondingly
higher in Romania. 
 Romania's central bank has forecast inflation will fall from
end-December's 8 percent to 3.6 percent at the end of this year,
within its 2-4 percent band, but price growth has consistently
overshot central bank targets since 2005.
 While headline inflation fell in January, it was higher than
expected due to rising food costs and core inflation was also
still elevated at 5.1 percent.
 Food, fuel and energy also make up more than 50 percent of
the inflation basket, compared with 30-40 percent in Hungary,
Poland or the Czech Republic and less in other EU states.
 Those prices have jumped significantly. The Goldman Sachs
commodities index has risen 46 percent since last June, and
crude oil is up some 59 percent.
 ""In 2012, the central bank will probably be surprised by
higher inflation than what they have in their projections,"" said
Miroslav Plojhar, EMEA economist at JP Morgan, the only analyst
in the Reuters poll that saw rates higher by the end of 2011.
 ""So a potential rate hike will be like trying to show that
they are managing things, that they have things under control.""

 * EU and Mercosur could achieve trade deal by year-end
 
 By Nigel Hunt
 LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The European Union's farm budget
is unlikely to face more than a symbolic cut in nominal terms
but will be eroded by inflation, a senior European Commission
official said on Wednesday.
 ""There could be a small or symbolic reduction in nominal
terms,"" Lars Hoelgaard, special adviser to the European
Commission's DG Agriculture and Rural Development, told Reuters
in an interview.
 ""In real terms, due to a lack of inflation correction, there
will be over time a reduction,"" he said on the sidelines of Agra
Europe's Outlook for Agriculture 2011 conference, adding that
the long-term decline in real terms would create opportunities
for more spending on non-farming EU policies.
 The EU spends about 40 percent of its budget on agriculture.
 The European Commission, the EU's executive, is preparing
legislative proposals to be issued this summer for the reform of
the region's common agricultural policy (CAP) from 2014.
 Britain's farm minister, Caroline Spelman, has called for ""a
very substantial cut to the CAP budget"", while others including
France have sought to defend it.
 Inflation has begun to creep higher in the European Union,
with January seeing the highest rise in producer prices in the
history of the euro zone.
 Hoelgaard said the EU was working hard to achieve a new
global trade deal through the World Trade Organization (WTO) but
in the meantime was seeking to open up markets through
negotiations with Mercosur, a grouping of South American
countries including Brazil and Argentina.
 
 MERCOSUR DEAL
 Long-running talks on a global trade deal are at last making
progress, but the pace of work is nowhere near fast enough to
meet a new self-imposed deadline of the end of the year, senior
trade officials said last month.
 ""Our preferred way of liberalising is on the multilateral
front, but since that hasn't moved so quickly and so much
forward, we do the second best,"" Hoelgaard said.
 Initial talks around five years ago made little progress,
but he said the EU hoped to secure a deal with Mercosur by the
end of the year.
 Mercosur is seeking improved access to EU agricultural
markets, while the EU would like to open up new markets in fast
growing economies such as Brazil for services such as banking
and a range of products from cars to computers.
 Hoelgaard said the prospects for an agreement may have
improved due to the recent narrowing of the price gap between
the European Union and Brazil for a range of commodities.
 ""Maybe the circumstances today are a bit improved because of
the levelling of price levels, which is making it a bit easier
to do a deal,"" he said.
 In sugar, for example, prices in the EU used to be far above
world market levels, but in the last few months they have at
times slipped to parity and maybe even a discount.
 Brazil is the world's leading producer of sugar.

 * Doha talks will be dead if not concluded this year
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, March 2 (Reuters) - Businesses are not working hard
enough to get a new world trade agreement even though the
so-called Doha deal is in their interest and is attainable,
former EU trade chief Leon Brittan said on Wednesday.
 Brittan, who is trade adviser to British Prime Minister
David Cameron, said he was optimistic a Doha deal could be done
this year, as called for by world leaders, but failure to do so
in 2011 would mean the trade pact would never be concluded.
As European trade commissioner, Brittan played a key role in
negotiations on the previous trade agreement, the Uruguay round
completed in 1994, and in setting up the World Trade
Organization.
 Businesses, especially American ones, played a vital part in
lobbying governments for the Uruguay deal, but this seemed not
to be the case in the talks known as the Doha Development Agenda
(DDA), Brittan, a former British cabinet minister, said.
 ""My impression is that the global business community is
supportive of the DDA but they're not giving it the priority
that they could, particularly in the United States,"" Brittan
said in a speech at the WTO.
 He said he was personally encouraging U.S. companies such as
online retailer Amazon.com, financial information group
Bloomberg and banking group J.P. Morgan to increase pressure on
the U.S. government.
 He also was talking to multinational corporations active in
Britain to persuade them to lobby for a Doha deal at home and in
other countries where they operate.
 U.S. officials have argued in recent years that what is on
the table in the Doha talks is not enough to spur businesses to
lobby the U.S. Congress to ratify a deal, and the package needs
to contain more business opportunities.
 Brittan said one reason the talks were attracting less
business interest was that the main obstacles to trade now are
non-tariff barriers such as red tape, which are less visible
than the high tariffs and duties that were the focus of the
Uruguay round.
 But what is on the table would produce the most far-reaching
increases in market access of any global trade negotiation, he
said. A deal would underpin world economic growth and help
developed and developing countries, he added.
 He also said agreement is close.
 ""It is safe to say that there is an agreement on about 80 or
90 percent of what would constitute the final deal,"" he said.
 Although there was no legal reason why the decade-old

that negotiators and politicians would not have the stomach to
continue if they fail to reach a deal in 2011, he said.
 ""Not only I, but everyone I have spoken to in a position of
responsibility in different main players in the world gets the
feeling that that is the case as far as the Doha round and this
year is concerned,"" he said.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - Gold hit a fresh record high
on Wednesday while world stocks declined as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa drove up oil prices and pushed
investors into safer assets.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> slipped 0.2
percent and was off about 2 percent from a 30-month peak set in
February. The index is still up about 3 percent since the start
of the year.
 U.S. stocks were slightly higher as upbeat labor market
data offset further gains in oil prices. For details, see
[ID:nN02213101]
 Also, in a flight to safety the dollar fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc, while U.S. Treasury prices were
lower.
 Investors were nervous that political instability could
spread to major oil producer Saudi Arabia, a central U.S. ally
in the region.
 ""If it continues to spread, Middle East tensions may reach
a point where a war could start and that could ignite an
incredible rally (in oil prices),"" said Ryoma Furumi, a
commodities sales manager at Newedge Japan.
 Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched a major offensive
against rebels in eastern Libya, sparking a rebel warning that
foreign military help might be needed to ""put the nail in his
coffin"" and end Gaddafi's long rule. [ID;nLDE721009]
 Saudi Arabia's stock markets declined for a 13th session
and hit a 22-month low, while Dubai equities fell to a 6-1/2
year low, reflecting investor worries over planned protests in
Saudi Arabia.
 ""We are seeing a significant elevation in risk premiums,
with investors revising their expectations for the region,""
said Hashem Montasser, managing partner at Frontlane Capital, a
Dubai-based asset management firm.
 ""The earnings outlook is very unclear.""
 Saudi Arabia's benchmark stock index <.TASI> fell nearly 4
percent at one point to a fresh 22-month low.
 At the same time, gold  hit a record high above
$1,436 an ounce, building on a 6 percent rise in February, its
biggest one-month climb since August.
 Brent crude for April delivery  rose 0.4 percent to
$115.83 a barrel on Wednesday. The contract settled up $3.62,
or 3.24 percent, at $115.42 a barrel on Tuesday, its highest
close since August 2008.
 U.S. crude for April delivery  rose 1 percent to
$100.66 early Wednesday.
 In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> rose 26.83 points, or 0.22 percent, at 12,084.85. The

 NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a near
four-month high versus the dollar on Wednesday and looked set
to extend gains on growing expectations interest rates in the
euro zone will rise earlier than those in the United States.
 The Swiss franc soared to a record high versus the dollar
as Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi launched an offensive against
rebels, sending investors to seek safety in the Swiss currency.
For the latest on Libya click on [ID:nLDE721009].
 The European Central Bank holds its policy meeting on
Thursday. With oil prices trading above $100 a barrel 
 and euro zone inflation well above target, investors
expect the ECB to sharpen its anti-inflation rhetoric.
 After struggling to break above key resistance at $1.3862,
its high for the year to date, the euro pierced that level as
North American trading got under way. The euro could make a run
toward $1.40 should the ECB strike a hawkish tone on inflation,
analysts said.
 ""The market seems to want to own euros right now,"" said
Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president of capital markets at
Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""The perception is growing in
the market that the ECB will certainly be hiking rates sooner
than the Fed and that's really underpinned the euro for the
time being.""
 The euro  climbed as high as $1.3868, its
strongest level since Nov. 9, before easing slightly to trade
at $1.3863, up 0.7 percent on the day.
 Traders reported large offer option-related offers ahead of
$1.39. Further upside targets include $1.3948, around the 76.4
percent retracement of the euro's fall from November to
January, and $1.3957, the 200-week moving average.
 The dollar index <.DXY> last fell 0.6 percent to 76.627,
after hitting its lowest since early November of 76.614.
 The U.S. currency has been unable to benefit from the
recent spike in risk aversion amid political tensions in the
Middle East and North Africa, prompting some investors to
question whether the dollar has lost its safe-haven status.
 ""People are starting to view the euro as a counter to the
dollar in times of turmoil simply because they both offer equal
security. However the euro is offering higher yields,""
Salvaggio said.
 The dollar has come under pressure as investors focused on
the view that higher oil prices would push other central banks
to raise interest rates to counter inflation even as the
Federal Reserve maintains its stimulative monetary policy.
 However, some analysts said if tensions deteriorate,
concerns about the impact of soaring oil prices on the global
economy could erode investor appetite for risk and help the
dollar regain its safe-haven status.
 ""If there is no resolution to the crisis in the Middle East
oil prices will stay elevated and people will stop focusing on
the inflationary impact. The euro is in favor now but in two to
three weeks it could be the dollar,"" said Simon Derrick,
currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 81.69 yen . It also
lost 0.7 percent to 0.9223 Swiss franc, after hitting a record
low of 0.9224 franc .

 * Promise to boost output by 50 percent
 * Import duty will contribute to inflation
 
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, March 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine may introduce an import
duty on gasoline and diesel fuel to protect its refineries from
Russian and Belarussian competitors who have access to cheaper
oil, a senior energy official said on Wednesday.
 The measure, certain to push up domestic fuel prices, could
be taken within two weeks, Kostyantin Borodin, the head of Oil
and Gas Industry Department of the Energy Ministry, said in an
interview with Reuters.
 ""Today, three of the country's refineries (out of seven) are
working,"" Borodin said. ""We expect all but one ... to be in
operation (if the import duty is introduced).""
 Local refineries, including those owned by Russia's TNK-BP
and LUKOIL, have asked the government to tax imported gasoline
at 130 euros ($179.9) per tonne and diesel fuel at 80 euros per
tonne.
 ""Refineries in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia are getting
oil with significant price discounts,"" Borodin said.
 ""In Belarus, where most imports come from, they can save
$150 per tonne of oil due to the difference in (Russian) export
duties alone.""
 Both Ukraine and Belarus rely on Russian oil supplies but
Moscow applies a lower export duty to shipments for Belarus with
which it has a customs union.
 The volume of crude processed by Ukrainian refineries halved
to about 10 million tonnes last year compared with 2005 when the
country dropped the previous fuel import duty, according to the
Energy Ministry data.
 Imports of oil products excluding heating oil grew to 4.5
million tonnes last year from 3.8 million tonnes in 2009.
 ""The volume of oil processed will grow by 50 percent this
year (if the import duty is introduced),"" Borodin said.
 Opponents of the measure have said it would only accelerate
inflation and will do nothing to stimulate much-needed refinery
upgrades.
 But Borodin said introduction of the protectionist measure
was a matter of survival for the industry.
 ""The introduction of the duty would mean restarting
refineries, economic growth, improved trade balance,"" he said.
 ""Not introducing the duty would mean further stagnation, no
upgrades in the oil refining sector, it means questioning
whether we need this sector at all.""

 * Central bank not increasing dollar supply at auctions
 * Some speculate that naira will face growing pressure
 * But c.bank still likely to keep naira in tight range
 * Inflation, approach of election argue against depreciation
 
 By Oludare Mayowa
 LAGOS, March 2 (Reuters) - The Nigerian naira 
weakened further against the U.S. dollar on the interbank market
on Wednesday as strong demand for the greenback persisted in the
face of static supply, traders said.
 The naira closed at 153.80 to the dollar against 153.54 on
the previous day as the central bank failed to meet all the
dollar demand at its bi-weekly auction. At the official window,
it sold $250 million at 150.71, compared to $342.34 million
demanded. On Monday, it sold $250 million at 150.56.
 Traders said dollar sales by units of Royal Dutch Shell and
Exxon Mobil were not sufficient to satisfy the market on
Wednesday.
 ""Ideally, we expect the naira to appreciate this week as a
result of dollar sales by most energy companies, but it seems
strong demand has weakened the impact of the inflows,"" one
dealer said.
 Most oil companies operating in Africa's top energy producer
sell dollars around the end of every month to obtain naira for
local obligations; dealers estimated such inflows since last
week, which have included dollar sales by state-run oil firm
NNPC, at about $500 million.
 But the inflows have not been enough to balance heavy dollar
demand, which dealers and analysts said may have been partly due
to a rise in imports of refined oil products, and an increase in
their price. The rise in international crude oil prices may not
yet be benefiting Nigeria because it is locked into long-term
contracts, while any additional dollars obtained from crude oil
exports may not be remitted to the country immediately.
 There may also be some short-term investment outflows from
Nigeria; the main stock index <.NGSEINDEX> has dropped nearly 8
percent from a late January peak, partlly because of a slide in
bank shares since investors fear the recapitalisation of banks
rescued in a bailout could see existing shareholders diluted.
 
 DEPRECIATION
 Traders said the naira would probably continue to depreciate
modestly in coming days unless the central bank increased its
dollar supplies to meet all the demand at its auctions.
 It may be reluctant to do this because of a continued
decline in Nigeria's foreign reserves, which slipped to $33.25
billion at the end of February from $34.01 billion on Feb. 17
and $41.38 billion a year earlier, according to data released on
Wednesday. [ID:nLDE7211HW]
 The International Monetary Fund said last month that
speculation against the naira could ""become intense"" if the
reserve depletion continued. [ID:nLDE71G1O1]
 However, although some investors are said to be going long
on the dollar in case there is eventually significant naira
depreciation, most traders and analysts still think there is
very little chance of the central bank permitting such a drop.
 The central bank has been supplying dollars to keep the
naira in a range of roughly 150-155 in the interbank market
since 2009, and appears unlikely to change this because of the
potential impact on inflation, and since any major move in the
rate could cause panic. Authorities may be particularly keen to
maintain stability before the April 9 presidential elections.
 Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi last month firmly
rejected the IMF's call for greater flexibility of the naira.
 ""We...do not think that it makes sense, if the IMF is
concerned about inflation, to ask a country that is import
dependent to devalue its currency...So the advice given by the
IMF, frankly, is not based on sound economic logic,"" he said.

 * Pound seen steady against the dollar
 * Sterling to gain some ground against the euro
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The outlook for sterling has
brightened over the past month as analysts become increasingly
convinced the Bank of England will raise rates sooner than was
thought to control rampant inflation, a Reuters poll found.
 Cable is seen climbing to $1.62 in 12 months time, a tad
above the $1.60 prediction in last month's survey, the poll of
65 foreign exchange strategists, taken this week, found.
 ""Sterling should continue to benefit from a weaker dollar
and the market's belief that the BoE will be forced to hike
rates sooner rather than later due to escalating inflation
pressures at home,"" said Roberto Mialich at UniCredit.
 UniCredit is currently joint top in the Reuters foreign
exchange accuracy league with accurate calls on dollar rates
against the euro, yen and sterling.
 The pound rallied to a 13-month high on Tuesday, reaching
$1.633, after stronger-than-expected economic data and comments
from Bank of England policymakers that inflation will remain
high this year.
 Inflation in Britain jumped to double the BoE's 2.0 percent
target in January, prompting Governor Mervyn King to acknowledge
that interest rates might rise more rapidly than economists had
expected.
 Rising turmoil in the Middle East has pushed up energy
prices, which spiked again last week, adding to inflation
pressures.
 The British central bank will probably not hike interest
rates until the fourth quarter of this year, according to the
consensus among economists. But the proportion of analysts
expecting an earlier move to curb soaring inflation is rising.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve is seen taking a more sedate path
than the BoE as it unwinds its own loose monetary policy.
 ""Rising energy prices have served to reinforce expectations
that monetary policy will diverge between the Fed and other
major central banks in 2011, undermining the dollar,"" said Lee
Hardman at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Hardman was the most
accurate forecaster in last month's poll.
 While analysts have upgraded their sterling outlook across
the board, they do not see much change from the $1.62 cable was
trading at on Wednesday.
 The pound was seen at $1.61 in one, three and six months
before edging up in 12 to $1.62. In last month's poll it was
seen at $1.58 in one month, $1.57 in three and six months and
$1.60 in a year's time.
 In February's poll only 17 out of 57 analysts were expecting
the pound to have strengthened above $1.60 in a month but in the
current poll around two-thirds now see it holding above that.
 Against the euro, sterling was seen strengthening marginally
over the year but forecasts were little changed from last month
as investors think the European Central Bank will also raise
rates in its own battle against inflation.
 The euro was seen worth 85 pence in one month, 84p in three
and 83p in a year's time, in line with February's poll.
 Sterling was seen more volatile against the dollar over the
coming month as Middle East unrest and seesawing crude oil
prices continue to plague markets.
 Analysts say the divergence of forecasts in Reuters currency
polls offers a leading indicator of exchange rate volatility in
the following month.

 * Analysts cite hawkish ECB statements for forecast upgrades
 * Volatile month expected for euro as oil price surges
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro's strong performance
against the dollar during February should tee it up for a better
year than thought even a month ago, a Reuters poll of foreign
exchange strategists showed on Wednesday.
 After a turbulent 2010 which saw the euro lose nearly 7
percent of its value against the greenback, the pan-European
currency has already gained around 4 percent this year,
prompting a hefty upgrade to analysts' forecasts.
 They see the euro at around $1.34 in three months and $1.33
in six, before strengthening to $1.35 in 12 months' time -- five
cents higher than the comparable forecast of $1.30 in February's
poll.
 While overall weaker than the $1.38 level hit on Wednesday,
the latest set of forecasts were pushed higher thanks to hawkish
statements from European Central Bank policymakers last month,
as well as some positive economic data.
 ""EUR-USD should hold the line further, as speculation about
ECB interest rate moves should work as the main driver in the
near term,"" said Roberto Mialich from UniCredit MIB,
historically one of the strongest forecasters in the Reuters
forex poll.
 Economists polled by Reuters last week said the ECB would
wait until at least October to raise interest rates, although
money markets have priced in a hike by August.
 Surging oil prices pushed euro zone inflation to 2.3 percent
in January, prompting a series of statements from ECB
policymakers reaffirming their commitment to maintaining price
stability.
 For the euro to enjoy a more sustained rally, Mialich said
progress would have to be made at forthcoming EU summits towards
solving the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Leaders from the 17 euro area states have scheduled a March
11 summit to discuss the bloc's handling of future debt crises,
with one document suggesting countries should pass special
legislation to safeguard the health of public finances.
 
 EURO WOBBLES
 Analysts expect much more volatility from the euro this
month, given the turmoil in Libya and the resultant impact on
oil prices, as well as continually shifting speculation on
interest rate policy.
 Brent crude rose towards $116 a barrel on Wednesday on
reports that the Libyan government has stepped up attacks on
rebel-held towns, heightening fears of civil war in a key oil
exporter.
 Consequently, euro volatility is expected to rocket to 15.1
percent in March from actual volatility of 9.4 percent in
February, based on standard deviation calculations from the poll
results.
 Key to the euro's fortunes in the next few months will be
the strength of the economic upturn taking place in the United
States, which so far looks like outpacing the comparable euro
zone recovery.
 ""On a risk/reward basis, we see downside EUR/USD developing
in the short term, especially if strong U.S. macro data fuels
speculation about QE2 and short-term U.S. yields start to gain
traction to the upside, compressing the spread with euro zone
yields,"" said Kenneth Broux from Lloyds Banking Group.
 Against the pound, analysts retained their forecasts for a
modest depreciation of the euro.
 Inflation in Britain jumped to 4.0 percent in January,
almost double the euro zone level and prompting increased
speculation the Bank of England will be forced to hike interest
rates sooner rather than later -- which would be positive for
sterling.
 Analysts expect the euro to decline from current levels
around 85 pence to 83 pence in 12 months' time.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2011 09:52AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Key political risks to watch in Hungary," BUDAPEST, March 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's government needs to
table credible and concrete fiscal reforms by July and implement
them thoroughly in order to retain investors' confidence.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban's centre-right Fidesz party
government remains a runaway favourite with voters even though
public support has declined slightly since last year's election
landslide.
 Fidesz has retained a three-to-one lead ahead of the main
opposition Socialists as it rejected austerity measures and
taxed big businesses to plug the budget deficit.
 Earlier this week, the government presented steps which it
says will reduce public debt to 65-70 percent of economic output
by the end of 2014 from around 80 percent now, by cutting public
spending, but the lack of detail disappointed markets.
 
 BUDGET POLICY/FISCAL REFORMS
 The main risk to the announced reforms, which will involve
cuts in disability pensions, drug subsidies, unemployment
benefits and education, is that they may be watered down if the
government meets social resistance.
 Implementation risk is also high given Hungary's poor track
record on fiscal discipline, and the government's recent moves
to tax big foreign companies and renationalise private pension
funds to avoid painful austerity measures.
 The European Union could also decide to extend its excessive
deficit procedure against Hungary if it rules that a one-off
budget surplus this year due to the impact of pension changes
will not improve the structural deficit in a sustainable way.
 Private pension funds have also flagged legal action in both
Hungary and at European level against the effective
renationalisation of the mandatory private pension fund pillar.
 All three major credit rating agencies have said they could
cut Hungary's debt to junk level from just above if the fiscal
reform plan is not credible, so markets will be closely watching
their assessment.
 What to watch:
 -- details on planned structural reforms
 -- EU comments on pension changes, fiscal sustainability
 -- rating agencies' view on reforms
 
 UNPREDICTABLE ECONOMIC POLICY
 There is a risk that the government will decide to raise or
keep in place various taxes on the business sector if its
proposed measures do not produce the required savings -- as its
recent decision to extend a bank levy into 2012 showed.
 Abandoning plans announced last year, the government has
also postponed a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 10
percent from 19 percent for big business from 2013 to cut public
debt and limit the need for savings elsewhere.
 What to watch:
 -- details on bank tax regime next year and in 2013/14
 -- comments on the future of ""crisis"" taxes on businesses,
which are due to expire at the end of 2012
 
 MEDDLING WITH CENTRAL BANK
 With a government-sponsored amendment to the central bank
law, parliament has assumed the right to fill the four vacant
spots on the central bank's Monetary Council this month,
stripping the governor of his right to name two policy makers.
 A parliamentary committee controlled by the ruling Fidesz
party will pick four new rate setters by March 7.
 The government has criticised the bank's interest rate rises
between November and January that took its main lending rate to
6 percent, saying the steps were unjustified and ran counter to
its pro-growth economic policy.
 The prime minister has also said he would have sacked the
bank's Governor Andras Simor if he had been able to.
 What to watch:
 -- who the four new rate setters will be, their views.
 -- any further attacks on Governor Simor and the bank.
 -- any attempts to meddle in monetary policy.
 -- monetary stimulus measures to boost economic growth.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2011 09:44AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-When gold's war premium goes, can it win the peace?"," * Middle East offers a boost for now
 * Gold to profit until central banks raise rates
 
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The bullion price's leap to
record highs has been fuelled by the fear factor stemming from
uprisings in the Arab world, but once calm is restored, gold's
battle with the world's central banks begins.
 In the six weeks since tanks rolled into the centre of Cairo
to quell protests that deposed former Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak, gold has risen by nearly 10 percent to hit a record
$1,436.40 an ounce on Wednesday as investors weigh up the
likelihood of an oil price shock to the global economy.
 Without the push for democracy sweeping North Africa and the
Middle East that propelled oil above $110 a barrel to 2-1/2 year
peaks, there was a strong argument bubbling in early 2011 that
the global recovery was gaining traction and inflation was
accelerating to warrant the developed world's central banks
raising interest rates.
 Now, investors are a lot less certain about the outcome of
these increasingly bloody protests, which have eclipsed the
prospect of gold-denting rate rises.
 ""Essentially, moving into gold, or silver, at this moment,
is more about a play that events in the Middle East are going to
deteriorate rather than get better,"" said RBS global commodities
strategist Nick Moore.
 ""Prior to this event, gold was already richly priced ... but
because every day ssems to bring fresh horrors in Libya, one
can't rule out that there won't be some maniacal event that
drives gold higher,"" he said. 
 
 GOLD-LINED
 Investors often buy gold to protect their portfolios from
the ravages of inflation. But when price pressures build enough
to trigger a response from a central bank, gold can quickly
switch from being a blessing to a non-yield bearing curse.
 There is no doubt that record food prices and soaring energy
costs are whittling away at consumer purchasing power and
investor returns, driving real interest rates -- a benchmark
rate minus inflation -- deeper into negative territory.
 The lower the rate of interest, the greater the support to
gold, which bears no yield of its own and therefore gets
sidelined for stocks, high-yielding currencies and bonds when
rates rise and returns improve.
 BlackRock, which manages a total $3.6 trillion and is a
major investor in gold and gold equities, said in February the
key threat to the bullion market is ""an increase in real
interest rates. When these begin to rise, the opportunity cost
of holding gold will encourage investors to sell the metal.""
 Real interest rates in the G7 economies are now all
negative except in Japan, compared with five nations this time
last year as inflation has picked up.
 In the rest of the G20, which includes Brazil, China, India
and Russia, real interest rates are negative in 6 of the 13
nations, compared with 5 this time last year.
 So the heat is on the central banks not to lag in the fight
against inflation, particularly in the emerging world, home to
the top biggest gold buyers -- India and China, which has
already raise rates three times since October 2010.
 ""There is lots of capital in China, they've got the same
fears that any other investor would have and with inflation
picking up, by holding renminbis you get negative real returns,""
said Deutsche Bank analyst Daniel Brebner.
 ""That doesn't make much sense and you have to look to hedge
against that risk,"" he said, adding: ""This is something we've
been seeing and it will continue.""
 
 GOLDILOCKS AND THE G3 BEARS
 Meanwhile, the gold/oil ratio -- the number of barrels of
oil needed to buy one ounce of gold -- has fallen to its lowest
since late 2008, the nadir of the global financial crisis,
indicating oil's outperformance relative to that of gold.
 But the effect of the Middle East turmoil on both assets has
made this particular market gauge less representative of
investor risk appetite or confidence in global growth.
 ""Both are inflation indicators but they can also be
safe-havens sometimes, so there is some credibility behind this
ratio, but don't read too much into it,"" said Commerzbank
analyst Eugen Weinberg. ""On the consumption side, those two
commodities are not competing with each other.""
 Market-based inflation expectations have also picked up
sharply from where they were six months ago.
 The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are widely
expected to withdraw emergency cash measures put in place during
the financial crisis, while many emerging economies like China
are tightening policy to combat inflation and ""hot-money""

 For now, even if gold loses its ""peace dividend"" from
tensions subsiding in the volatile Middle East, it is still a
long way off buckling under the weight of the central banks
collectively allowing for higher inflation and stronger growth.
 After all, aside from gold, no other major asset class has
rallied for 10 years in a row, defying global boom and bust,
inflation, deflation, oversupply or shrinking consumer demand.

(Adds details)
 MOSCOW, March 2 (Reuters) - New York-based investment firm
Renco Group said it agreed to buy three of Russian steel maker
Severstal's U.S. mills in order to create its own flat rolled
steel business in a deal valued at $1.2 billion.
 Its new unit, RG Steel, will be the fourth-largest producer
of flat rolled steel in the U.S., and take its place alongside
other Renco assets, such as Humvee manufacturer AM General.
 In a separate statement, Severstal said it will receive $125
million in cash, a $100 million secured note and the repayment
of $317 million of third party debt. Renco will also assume
various Severstal liabilities totaling $650 million.
 The deal allows Severstal to close a chapter on what has
been a troubled story of investment in the North American steel
industry.
 Its operations there posted a negative earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of
$59 million in the third quarter, compared to a positive EBITDA
of $59 million in the second quarter, reflecting what it called
a ""challenging US steel market.""
 Severstal is scheduled to post its fourth-quarter results on
Thursday.
 Renco will acquire mills in Warren, Ohio, Wheeling, West
Virginia and Sparrows Point, Maryland. This will provide its RG
Steel unit with 7.5 million tonnes of annual capacity.
 Both companies expect the transaction to be completed in
March.

 * Move comes after UAE president tours emirates - WAM
 
 (Adds quotes, funding details)
 ABU DHABI, March 2 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates,
watching as Arab unrest spreads to nearby Gulf countries, will
invest $1.6 billion to improve infrastructure in less developed
regions of the country, state media said on Wednesday.
 The decision to expand water and electricity networks at a
cost of 5.7 billion dirhams came after President Sheikh Khalifa
bin Zayed al-Nahayan last month ordered a tour to the less
prosperous areas of the world's third largest oil exporter to
assess their living conditions.
 ""Electricity supply is to be provided to buildings and shops
belonging to citizens in the northern emirates, the president
ordered,"" the state news agency WAM said.
 Revolts against oppressive leaders and economic hardships
have been sweeping through the Arab world over the past two
months, ousting the presidents of Egypt and Tunisia. They now
challenge regimes in Libya as well as nearby Bahrain and Oman.
 The UAE, the second largest Arab economy, has escaped the
unrest so far. Its relatively small local population enjoys one
of the world's highest economic outputs per capita, at over
$47,000.
 ""There is unrest in so many Arab countries. The issue is
causing discomfort and has been addressed in the UAE 25-30 years
ago,"" said Khaled Abdulla al-Qubaisi, a senior adviser at the
Abu Dhabi government investment fund Mubadala.
 ""Basic necessities are provided for jobs, health, good
quality of life in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. We don't see that as
an issue,"" he said on the sidelines of an event in Abu Dhabi.
 ""Whether they finance it directly or with local and
international funding sources, funding is not going to be a
major challenge,"" said Simon Williams, chief economist at HSBC
Bank in Dubai.
 It was not clears how the plan would be financed.
 The UAE plans to spend 41 billion dirhams ($11.16 billion)
in its 2011 deficit budget.
 Abu Dhabi, which accounts for most of the UAE's oil output
and fiscal spending, has not released a budget for this year.
 Potential for disturbances would most likely come from the
five northern emirates, whose citizens have benefited less from
the capital Abu Dhabi's vast oil wealth or trade and
property-fuelled development in business hub Dubai.
 Ras al-Khaimah, one of the northern emirates, has seen small
protests in past years but they were quickly crushed by Abu
Dhabi security forces. The emirate sits on the Strait of Hormuz,
through which 40 percent of the world's seaborne oil passes.
 The president ordered the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity
Authority to supply the Federal Electricity and Water Authority
with around 1,300 megawatts of power to meet projected demand.
 He also called for construction of a 100-km (62-mile) water
pipeline costing 900 million dirhams from the northern town of
Kalba to Dibba on the eastern coast, as well as a 60-km pipeline
worth 300 million dirhams in Umm al-Quwain emirate, WAM said.
 Supermarkets in the UAE have agreed with the economy
ministry to cut prices for food and other essential goods by up
to 40 percent for one month.

 By Zhou Xin and Koh Gui Qing
 BEIJING, March 2 (Reuters) - China wants to allow importers
and exporters across the nation to settle trades in the yuan
this year, the central bank said on Wednesday, a move that would
grow the currency's role in international financial markets.
 The plans, published by the People's Bank of China after a
meeting about the yuan's role in cross-border deals, underlined
Beijing's ambitions to turn the presently tightly-controlled
yuan into a convertible and dominant currency in coming years.
 ""The market's demand for cross-border use of the yuan is
rising, and cross-border yuan business is expected to grow
strongly,"" the central bank said in a statement.
 Besides relaxing its hold over the yuan in cross-border
trade deals, the central bank said it would also:
 -- increase the number of channels through which the yuan
can flow back into China. That would be done in part by allowing
more foreign banks to buy bonds in China's inter-bank market.
 -- Respond ""actively"" to any demands from foreign central
banks to use the yuan as a reserve currency;
 -- seek bilateral currency swap deals to encourage the use
of the yuan in bilateral trade and investment;
 -- trial a programme for overseas investment using the yuan;
 -- study the possibility of allowing foreign direct
investment in China using the yuan;
 -- give China's monetary policy committee, an advisory body,
a bigger role in policy making;
 -- study and research possible impacts from yuan flows on
monetary policy, interest rates and exchange rates.
 China first experimented with plans to relax its control
over the yuan last year by allowing importers and exporters in
20 provinces to conduct their businesses in the yuan.
 The trial, which now covers 67,000 companies, has proven to
be a success. The total value of trade settled in the yuan
rocketed to 506.3 billion yuan ($77.06 billion) in 2010.
 As a by-product of Beijing easing its control over the yuan,
the offshore yuan business in Hong Kong has exploded as well,
with foreign banks eager to get a foothold in the rapidly
growing yuan deposit and bond issuance businesses.
 As of December, only five foreign banks including HSBC
and Standard Chartered are allowed to trade in the Chinese
bond market within a quota of 29.2 billion yuan the central bank
said.
 China has inked eight bilateral currency deals, worth a
total of 803.5 billion yuan, since the end of 2008 in a move to
give the yuan a bigger international role.

(Adds details, quotes)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, March 2 (Reuters) - Global airline net profits will
halve this year as rising costs, especially oil prices, offset
increasing demand, the industry body IATA said on Wednesday.
 The result would be a net profit margin this year of only
1.4 percent -- dismissed by IATA Director-General Giovanni
Bisignani as more worthy of a charity than an industry -- down
from 2.9 percent in 2010.
 Bisignani told a news conference that increased taxes such
as levies on ticket prices were another threat to the struggling
industry, which he said was not sustainable in the long term,
and called on governments to review regulations to underpin
airline profitability.
 ""We are constantly walking on a tightrope with very thin
margins, and there is no buffer,"" he said. ""This industry is
very, very fragile.""
 The International Air Transport Association, whose 230
members include Singapore Airlines and Deutsche Lufthansa, now
expects global net profit to be $8.6 billion this year, down
from $9.1 billion forecast in December.
 Net profit is estimated at $16 billion in 2010, revised up
from the $15.1 billion estimate in December.
 Those profits come on revenues forecast at $594 billion this
year, up from an estimated $552 billion in 2010. Revenues stand
against industry debts of $210 billion, Bisignani noted.
 IATA's forecasts assume an average oil price of $96 per
barrel for Brent crude this year, up from $84 forecast in
December, and $$79.4 a barrel in 2010.
 As a result the industry's fuel bill will rise to $166
billion this year -- 29 percent of total costs -- from $139
billion or 26 percent in 2010.
 Bisignani said every $1 increase in the price of a barrel of
oil adds $1.6 billion in costs to airlines, which are estimated
to have hedged 50 percent of their fuel purchases this year.
 IATA declined to speculate whether the latest oil price
increases would lead to fuel surcharges on tickets, as that is a
matter for its individual members.
 The improving global economy will increase demand for
airline products, with passenger growth expected to be 5.6
percent this year, up from December's 5.2 percent increase,
while cargo demand -- an important indicator of world trade --
is seen rising 6.1 percent, up from 5.5 percent in December.
 The IATA global forecast includes wide variation in airline
performance by region, with carriers in the Asia-Pacific region
expected to produce a net profit margin of 4.6 percent. Airlines
in the region benefit from the strong economy, but have hedged
fuel prices relatively loss than those in other countries.
 European airlines are the least profitable of the major
regions.

 KARACHI, March 2 (Reuters) - Pakistan will impose a flood
surcharge of 15 percent on income tax in order to tackle the
country's widening budget deficit, a government source involved
in talks with the IMF said on Wednesday.	
 ""Yes, we plan to impose the flood surcharge,"" the source
told Reuters, declining to give details of when the surcharge
might be levied.	
 Pakistan, whose tax-to-GDP ratio is around 10 percent, one
of the world's lowest, is trying to show the IMF and other
donors that it is working on ways to boost revenue. 
 The country is dependent on foreign aid, and riven with
political instability and violence. On Wednesday, gunmen shot
dead the only Christian in Pakistan's government, the second top
official killed this year for questioning a law that mandates
the death penalty for insulting Islam. 
 The struggling government, still contending with damage from
disastrous floods last year, is desperate to raise money.	
 According to news reports, as well as the flood surcharge,
it plans to increase a special excise duty by 150 percent soon
after a National Assembly recess.	
 ""The proposal to increase the special excise duty on nine
luxury items has been with the National Assembly since last
year,"" said another government source.
 The two measures, according to media reports, would raise 46
billion rupees ($597 million) during the fiscal year 2010/11
(July-June) and increase the revenue target to 1,630 billion
rupees ($19 billion).	
 The measures will be presented to an International Monetary
Fund (IMF) team that arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday to conduct
the fifth review and evaluate the country's performance for the
possible release of a sixth loan tranche, delayed since August
last year. The team is expected to stay until March 8.	
 The two measures could be an alternative to a key condition
for the release of the sixth tranche: the implementation of a
reformed general sales tax (RGST). The IMF and international
donors are demanding Pakistan tax more of its economy.	
 Neither government nor IMF sources would comment on the
RGST, which has stalled in parliament.	
 In December, the IMF approved a nine-month extension of
Pakistan's $11 billion loan, which was due to end last year, to
give authorities time to complete the implementation of key
fiscal reforms.	
 The extension runs to Sept. 30, 2011.	
 Pakistan's widening budget deficit was 2.9 percent of GDP in
the six months ending Dec. 31. In November 2010, Pakistan agreed
with the IMF that it would keep its deficit at 4.7 percent for
the 2010/11 fiscal year.	
 Analysts say Pakistan is likely to overshoot this figure.	
 Some forecast the deficit will be around 8 percent, higher
than the central bank's prediction of between 6.0 and 6.5
percent, if fiscal reforms are not implemented, but the
implementation of a RGST could deepen public frustrations with
the unpopular government.	
 In May, Pakistan received $1.13 billion in the fifth
tranche.

(Adds detail, background)
 FRANKFURT, March 2 (Reuters) - The chief executive of
French-German energy exchange EEX has resigned for personal
reasons, shortly after Deutsche Boerse bought a majority stake
in the exchange.
 The Leipzig-based exchange said on Wednesday the supervisory
board agreed to Hans-Bernd Menzel's request and his duties
would, for the time being, be executed by board members Iris
Weidinger and Christoph Mura.
 A spokeswoman declined to give further details.
 Last month Deutsche Boerse's derivatives unit Eurex Zuerich,
an existing shareholder in EEX, took a majority stake in the
exchange to diversify its business away from a dependence on
shares and derivatives trading.
 The 71.3 million euro ($98.50 million) transaction came as
traditional European exchanges and new, or more specialised,
operators fight for market share.
 EEX and Eurex had already been cooperating in trading and
clearing energy contracts.
 The EEX accounts for power trading equivalent to a third of
European consumption. Its activities span power trading in
continental Europe, which has been linked to the Nordic region
and the UK via cables, and already reaches through to Hungary.
 Apart from flagship power futures contracts, forays into the
emerging traded gas market have been promising.
 But energy markets have also fretted over the possibility of
increasing financial regulation which they say could make
genuine hedging strategies for the sector too costly.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2011 04:52AM ET</span>",SPECIAL REPORT-Jon Huntsman's path to White House starts in China," As a former executive with the family chemical business,
which has operations in China, Huntsman mixes easily with U.S.
executives who pass through Beijing to explore opportunities in
the world's second-largest economy.
    ""I've always found him very engaged and committed to working
with U.S. companies to address commercial issues we have
abroad,"" said Myron Brilliant, a senior vice president at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.	
 Huntsman's relatively high profile in China has a cinematic
dimension. He has allowed a video crew to follow him in a range
of settings over the past year, a person familiar with the video
production told Reuters. The privately funded project ostensibly
plans to make a documentary about Huntsman, although it would
undoubtedly come in handy in any political campaign.
    Huntsman and the embassy declined to confirm or comment
about the video crew.
    ""If China is an issue in the 2012 campaign, and I believe
that it will be an issue, Jon's China experience will be an
asset,"" said Kamm, the human rights group executive.
    ""As the other candidates pound away on China, he can ask how
many have ever visited the country, met with senior leaders,
speak the language? In a field of 10 candidates, he could be the
only one that adopts an intelligent, nuanced approach to the
country.""
    Others say Huntsman's role in China, no matter how nuanced,
may be largely irrelevant to an electorate more concerned about
jobs in a sluggish economy at home.
    Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, could crowd out
Huntsman for those votes, said Tim Chambless, political
scientist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. 
 ""As long as Americans are thinking about the economy as a
front and center, that helps Mitt Romney more than it helps
Jon,' Chambless said. ""Jon Huntsman is perceived right now as an
excellent ambassador and excellent diplomat, but it's Mitt
Romney who has intentionally been carving out a political niche
as a turnaround artist.""
    Romney has been traveling the United States, making
appearances ""while Jon Huntsman has been halfway around the
world"".
    Judging from the chatter on Chinese blogs and websites,
Huntsman's campaigns in China have won him much goodwill among
ordinary Chinese and officials alike because of his ability to
speak Mandarin and as the father of his 11-year-old adopted
daughter, Gracie Mei. He and his wife Mary Kaye also have seven
of their own children.
    ""Overall, I think he leaves quite a positive image among the
Chinese government for being very professional and for being
able to speak Mandarin,"" said Shi Yinhong of the Center for
American Studies at Renmin University.
    As he weighs his options, Huntsman has the luxury of time
and patience, a virtue that China with its long history often
preaches.
    ""My own perception,"" says Chambless, ""is that he's really
sending signals out for 2016 rather than 2012.""

 (Adds exports, ranking in global output) 
 MOSCOW, March 2 (Reuters) - Russia increased oil output in
February, approaching record levels and retaining its status as
the world's top producer, but leaving little spare capacity to
respond to global supply shocks, data showed on Wednesday.
 Russia produced 10.23 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil
last month, up from 10.21 million bpd in January and just shy of
October's daily record 10.26 million bpd, the Energy Ministry
data showed.
 Russia forecasts its output for the rest of the decade will
average 10 million bpd or slightly more.
 It exported 5.24 million bpd, the data, provided by Russia's
Energy Ministry, showed.
 At February's rate, Russia comfortably maintained its rank
as the world's top crude producer with a margin of 1.6 million
bpd over Saudi Arabia during the month, according to a Reuters
survey..
 But unlike Saudi Arabia, Russia boasts little, if any, spare
capacity to step into any gaps caused by political upheaval in
the Middle East.
 A senior Saudi oil official said on Monday the kingdom was
pumping at 9 million bpd and still had 3.5 million bpd of spare
capacity.
 Russia faces significant costs in the coming years to
squeeze more oil out of the ageing Soviet-era fields of Western
Siberia and expand new projects, much of whose oil is destined
for the fast-growing markets of Asia.
 The marginal output that has helped the country pump at peak
levels has largely been from smaller producers such as the
fields of Sakhalin, operated by Russian and foreign oil
companies under production-sharing agreements.
 Gas output slipped slightly to 2.04 billion cubic meters per
day, a decline of 10 million cubic metres per day from the
previous month and 0.4 percent below its output level in
February 2010.

 By Naveen Thukral and Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, March 2 (Reuters) - Spiralling shipping costs for
commodities threaten to drive food inflation even higher as
nations from Asia to the Middle East and Africa scramble for
supplies, stung by grain prices that have more than doubled in
less than a year.	
 Even if the jump in freight costs proves temporary as new
vessels flow into the shipping industry, any add-on costs to
food prices that are already at records could stoke fears of
more instability in the Middle East and a rerun of 2008's food
riots. 
 Freight rates on key grain routes, which started recovering
from two-year lows on Feb. 4, are expected to rise further in
the second quarter, driven by soaring fuel costs and a jump in
seasonal demand for grains, sugar and cotton.	
 Global food prices, measured by the UN's Food and
Agriculture Organisation, have already hit record highs in
January, a problem that will worsen as freight costs feed into
the prices people pay for bread and meat in supermarkets.

 ""We are seeing an increase in grains trade, people are
trying to build stocks and it is logical to see an impact on the
freight market,"" said Abah Ofon, an agricultural commodities
analyst at Standard Chartered Bank. 
 ""It will cause more concern over food inflation as all that
adds up to the cost of commodities.""	
 A brief spike in Asian grain demand in February doubled
daily earnings for panamax vessels from the U.S. West Coast to
the Far East, also known as the transpacific route, to $15,398
from $7,590 in a little over two weeks.	
 The typically volatile market has since subsided along with
a momentary pause in Asian demand, but analysts said the surge
was just a preview of things to come.	
 ""In each of the last four years, the run-up to the Latin
American grain export season has been characterised by a marked
rise in panamax earnings,"" said ship brokerage firm SSY.	
 ""A high proportion of Latin American cargoes will be bound
for long-haul markets in the Far East, notably China where the
U.S. Agriculture Department expects another new record for the
country's soybean imports.""	
 Brazil and Argentina -- the world's leading exporters of
corn and soybeans -- enter the market around March after the
harvest each year, selling cargoes to customers in Asia, led by
top importers China, Japan and South Korea.	
 Average earnings for panamax vessels on the
transpacific route , a key line for corn and wheat
shipments, soared as much as 48 percent from February to May
last year, and 186 percent during the same period in 2009.	
 Other key grain freight routes, including handysize and
supramax shipment lines from Australia to Asia, were also likely
to rise in the second and third quarters.	


 
 SUBDUED RALLY	
 The rally, however, was not expected to be as strong, nor
last as long, as in previous years due to a flood of new vessels
that has kept the broader freight market near two-year
lows.	
 Freight futures indicated earnings on the transpacific route
would edge up just 7 percent to average $14,925 a day in May, up
from $13,980 in March, according to the Baltic Exchange.	
 Grain shipments represent just over 10 percent of the
overall dry bulk market, trailing the two dominant commodities
-- iron ore and coal -- that each represents 30 percent of
seaborne trade.	
 ""We could see one or two bright spots in an otherwise
depressed freight market -- the grain routes being one of them,""
said a Seoul-based shipbroker. ""I'm sure there will be a bounce
in rates, but how big is the question."" 
 The predictions for a smaller-than-usual seasonal bounce in
freight rates, however, do not take into account soaring oil
prices and piracy risk insurance that could fuel a larger rally,
if shipowners decide to pass the costs on to their clients.	
 Bunker fuel prices , which can make up anywhere
from 10 to 70 percent of operating costs depending on the type
of vessel, have climbed to 2-1/2 year highs along with oil's
surge to near $120 a barrel.	
 ""Bunker fuel prices are going up and it is a very large cost
in running a ship,"" said one chartering manager with a global
grains trading company. ""There are a lot of issues that are
going to gradually push up the cost....on top of that list is
insurance.""	
 A surge in pirate attacks in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf
of Aden has also raised the cost of shipping in the region.

 FOOD INFLATION	
 The gains in freight costs, small or not, will add to
growing inflationary concerns that have spread from China and
India to the European Union, mainly due to red-hot food prices.	
 U.S. corn , wheat and soybean prices -- key
ingredients for making food and animal feed -- jumped to their
highest in 2-1/2 years in February. 
 Sugar also surged to three-decade highs on a squeeze
in supplies as a result of crop damage in cyclone-hit Australia
and uncertainty over exports from India. Prices for Malaysian
palm oil , a cooking staple in the developing world, hit
3-year highs earlier in February in the wake of floods.	
 ""It is looking very tight, especially for corn, until the
end of the year because stocks-to-use ratio is very tight,"" said
Nobuyuki Chino, president of Tokyo-based trading company Unipac
Grain. ""If there is adverse weather during the growing season in
the United States, then the sky is the limit for prices.""	
 Corn posted its third straight monthly rise in February.
The U.S. government last week said U.S. farmers this year would
plant corn over the second-largest area in nearly 70 years, but
stocks next season would still remain thin.	
 There is also higher demand for wheat emerging from
crisis-hit buyers in Africa and the Middle East, where
authorities have embarked upon food stockpiling to avert the
kind of protests that toppled regimes in Tunisia and Egypt.

 In the latest move to stockpile grain, Egypt, the world's
largest wheat importer, bought 235,000 tonnes of soft wheat from
the United States and France, while Saudi Arabia's state grains
buyer took 275,000 tonnes of milling wheat. 
 The buying frenzy has spread to other countries, with South
Korea and Bangladesh aggressively contracting for grain cargoes
to build reserves. Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy,
has bought 820,000 tonnes of rice, while suspending import
duties on rice, soybeans and wheat.	
 Still, rising freight costs will only add to the agony for
grain importers. ""The freight market has bottomed out and it is
likely to go higher and increase the burden for importers,""
Chino said.

have joined together to market mutual funds to retail investors,
aiming to increase their share of that hefty market to a third
from just 1.5 percent now, their heads said on Wednesday.
 SBI Holdings, kabu.com Securities, Monex Securities and
Rakuten Securities, a unit of internet retailer Rakuten Inc, will
cooperate to launch and market new investment trust funds, or
""toushin"", together.
 The $787 billion toushin market is equivalent in size to the

 ""Our goal is to take a share of 30 percent in three years. We
also want to beat major securities houses and banks in the area

officer of Monex said at a news conference.
 The four brokers in total hold about 900 billion yen ($11
billion) in assets under management in the retail investment
trust fund market.
 The toushin market saw net inflows from retail investors for
the 22nd consecutive month in January.
 Japanese individuals, a major force in financial markets with
some $15 trillion in personal assets mostly parked in deposits,
are seeking to diversify their assets to obtain better returns.
 The online brokers think it will be possible to dramatically
increase their assets in the sector following their success in
boosting their retail equity trading.
 Retail trading volume at five online brokers, including
Matsui Securities, accounted for 87 trillion yen, or 71.4 percent

 By Ian Chua
 SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell slightly on
Wednesday after yet again failing to break through a key
resistance level, helping lift the dollar off a 3-½ month low
against a basket of currencies.
 However, further declines for the common currency may be
limited a day ahead of a European Central Bank meeting. Given
that euro zone inflation is well above the ECB's target, markets
expect the central bank may sharpen its anti-inflation rhetoric.
 ""We're not likely to see a very deep pull-back in the euro
given the possibility the ECB strikes a very hawkish tone, which
contrast pretty starkly with the Fed,"" said Sean Callow,
strategist at Westpac Bank.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the U.S. Senate
Banking Committee that while he saw increasing evidence the U.S.
economic recovery has enough momentum to become self-supporting,
jobs growth remained far too anaemic.
 His comments underscored market expectations the ECB will
probably raise interest rates before the Fed.
 Bernanke also said the surge in oil prices was unlikely to
hurt the U.S. economy unless it was sustained. Brent crude oil
hit its highest closing price in 2-½ years on Tuesday as more
turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa kept investors on
edge. [ID:nNL3E7DP07]
 The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.3761 . The euro has
retreated after it failed on Tuesday to clear the one-month high
of $1.3857 it struck on Monday.
 Support is seen around $1.3700/10, lows that have supported
the common currency in the past few sessions. A break above
$1.3860 should open further upside potential towards the $1.42
area, BNP Paribas analysts said.
 ""If there is some type of rhetoric that hints at the
possibility of raising interest rates, market players will
probably jump on that,"" said a trader for a major Japanese bank
in Singapore, referring to the ECB's policy meeting on Thursday.
 Economists polled by Reuters believe the ECB will hold fire
on rates until at least October, but financial markets expect on
earlier hike from the current record low of 1 percent.

 The euro's dip helped the dollar climb from a 3-½ month
trough against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index
<.DXY> last stood at 77.111, up 0.1 percent on the day. It fell
as low as 76.735 on Tuesday, its lowest since early November.
 The dollar also rose against the New Zealand dollar, which
slid 0.7 percent to $0.7412  and tumbled to a 19-year

 The kiwi fell after New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told
Bloomberg in an interview that he expected New Zealand's central

 Traders said the drop in the New Zealand dollar was
exacerbated by stop-loss selling, with the Australian dollar
gaining an additional lift against the kiwi after option
barriers were taken out at NZ$1.3650.
 The Australian dollar climbed to as high as NZ$1.3669
, the Aussie's highest level against the kiwi since
August 1992. After trimming some gains, the Aussie was up 0.5
percent from late U.S. trading on Tuesday at NZ$1.3611.
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 81.93 yen

 SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro stayed on the back foot

 HONG KONG, March 2 (Reuters) - Oil rose towards a 2-1/2 year
high and stocks fell on Wednesday as investors shunned risky
assets on concern that escalating tension in Libya would spread
in the Middle East and disrupt fuel supplies.	
 Brent crude's dizzying 15 percent jump in less than
two weeks has fanned worry about a stifling impact on the
economic recovery, sending investors into relative safe assets
such as gold and government bonds in volatile trading.	
 Though Asian stocks have gyrated to the swings in oil,
markets have been largely resilient this time around compared
with January's sell-off when investors dumped shares because of
worry about inflation.	
 While oil's jump has put monetary policy behind the curve in
some countries, many Asian central banks have already tightened
considerably since the recovery began and therefore policy is
not excessively loose in the region, IHS Global Insight said.	
 Brent crude futures rose 50 cents to $115.92 after the
contract closed on Tuesday at $115.42, its highest finish since
August 2008. 
 U.S. crude for April rose 73 cents to $100.36.	
 Shares in most Asian markets fell after Wall Street's slide,
where the main indexes fell between 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent,
and as the CBOE Volatility Index VIX , the so-called fear
gauge, jumped sharply.	
 Tokyo lead the losers with stocks falling more than
2 percent on futures-led selling. Seoul and Taiwan
both fell.	
 Yahoo Japan was the notable outperformer with
shares surging by 4.5 percent after a Reuters report that Yahoo
Inc was in advanced talks to wind down its joint
venture in Japan with Softbank Corp . 
 
 ""The market is volatile as oil's persisting gains and civil
unrest in the Middle East is negatively affecting investor
sentiment,"" said Lee Sun-yeb, a market analyst at Shinhan
Investment Corp.	
 ""But as long as we do not see the turmoil spreading to other
countries within the region, current volatility will be
contained and will eventually recover,"" Lee added.	
 The broader MSCI index of Asia-ex Japan stocks
was down more than a percent. It fell two
percent in February.	
 In the credit space, Asian sovereign spreads weakened with
the Philippines widening the most by 4 bps to 140/143 bps.	
 Markets will keenly watch developments in the Middle East,
especially Saudi Arabia, where stock markets tanked by nearly 7
percent on Tuesday and CDS spreads jumped. 
 
 GOLD, BONDS GAIN	
 U.S. Treasuries, a safe-haven asset, held near one-month
lows with 10-year yields stabilising at 3.40
percent, well below a peak of 3.74 percent hit last month. 
 Japanese government bonds too rose, with futures snapping a
three-day losing streak. 
 Gold held just below a record high of $1,434 an ounce
while spot silver hit a 31-year high. 
 In the currency markets, the euro dipped slightly
after failing to break through a key resistance level, though
further declines for the common currency may be limited a day
before a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting.	
 Given euro zone inflation holding well above the ECB's
target, markets expect the central bank to ramp up its
anti-inflation talk with U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's comments reinforcing market speculation that the ECB
would raise rates before the Fed.	
 In Asian FX, the won is among the leading
underperformers with the stock market working through a major
support level.	
 The New Zealand dollar fell sharply after Prime
Minister John Key said he expected the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand (RBNZ) would cut interest rates next week after the
devastating earthquake in Christchurch. 
 The Aussie/kiwi was last at NZ$1.3616 after
hitting a high of NZ$1.3667 , levels not seen since
August 1992.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Gold rose to an all-time high
on Tuesday as investors fled risky assets amid escalating
violence in Libya, and oil prices jumped to their highest in 2
1/2 years.
 Oil's surge, which fanned worries about a dampening effect
on the economic recovery, pushed investors out of stocks. U.S.
Treasuries, also a safe-haven asset, rose.
 Major U.S. stock indexes dropped more than 1 percent, and
the CBOE Volatility Index VIX <.VIX>, Wall Street's fear gauge,
jumped 13.3 percent.
 ""From the start of crude oil's ascent based on Libya, you
are seeing general risk issues become more of a front burner in
peoples' psyche,"" said James Dailey, portfolio manager of the
TEAM Asset Strategy Fund.
 Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has driven gold
and oil prices up sharply in the past month. The turmoil has
unseated leaders in Tunisia and Egypt, and more recent chaos in
Libya has sparked concern the unrest will engulf other oil
producers in the region.
 Spot gold  was last up 1.4 percent at $1,430.75 an
ounce, and earlier hit an all time-high at $1,432.10. Gold was
up 6 percent in February.
 In London, ICE Brent for April delivery  settled at
$115.42 a barrel, rising $3.62. It was the highest settlement
since Aug. 27, 2008, when front-month Brent crude oil futures
closed at $116.22.
 High oil prices are ""essentially a huge tax on consumers,
who make up two-thirds of the (U.S.) economy. So there's no way
(gross domestic product) won't suffer on this,"" said Scott
Armiger, portfolio manager at Christiana Trust in Greenville,
Delaware, which has $6.8 billion in client assets.

 NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recovered
from a 3-1/2-month low against a basket of other major
currencies on Tuesday as the euro again failed to breach
resistance at its 2011 high.
 Analysts expect the euro to stay supported ahead of
Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting, at which the
ECB may signal a willingness to hike rates. But after the
currency peaked at $1.3855, investors found little incentive to
push it higher.
 Trading was volatile. however, particularly after Federal
Reserve chief Ben Bernanke offered no hint that the U.S.
central bank was considering tightening its loose monetary
policy.
 ""We need to get through $1.3860 to signal another leg
higher,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York,
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, fell to
76.735, its weakest level since early November, before
recovering to 77.053, up 0.2 percent from the prior close.
 Most of the gains in the index came from declines in the
euro.
 The euro was last down 0.2 percent at $1.3773 ,
pushing nearly a cent below the one-month high of $1.3857 hit
on trading platform EBS on Monday. The session low posted at
$1.3762 on EBS, a clear break of support at the $1.3775 level,
the 23.6 percent retracement of the euro's rise from the Feb.
22 low to the Feb. 28 high.
 ""The hurdle from here is whether or not ECB President
Trichet will deliver a more hawkish tone,"" said Camilla Sutton,
senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto,
referring to expected remarks by ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet
after a policy meeting on Thursday.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on
Tuesday as oil prices shot up on worries about supply
disruptions, fanning concerns about a dampening effect on
economic growth.
 Gold prices rose more than 1 percent to within a dollar of
their record high as escalating violence in Libya and unrest
spreading across the Middle East boosted the precious metal's
safe-haven appeal.
 The losses in stocks fueled a bid for U.S. government debt,
another safe-haven area.
 World equities, measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 0.6 percent. The index had gained
2.8 percent in February.
 The U.S. dollar was up slightly against major currencies,
after earlier hitting a fresh 3-1/2-month low.
 U.S. stocks, which are up about 25 percent since the start
of September, declined despite data showing the U.S.
manufacturing sector grew in February at its fastest rate since
May 2004.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in testimony to the
U.S. Senate Banking Committee, said higher oil prices were
unlikely to have a big impact on the U.S. economy but could
lead to weaker growth if sustained. For details, see
[ID:nN28285146]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 137.25
points, or 1.12 percent, at 12,089.09. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 17.91 points, or 1.35 percent, at
1,309.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 41.67
points, or 1.50 percent, at 2,740.60.
 High oil prices are ""essentially a huge tax on consumers,
who make up two-thirds of the economy. So there's no way (gross

 U.S. crude for delivery in April  rose $2.71 to
$99.68 a barrel, while Brent crude  was up $3.55 at
$115.35 on continued concerns about supply disruptions amid
unrest in Libya. [ID:nL3E7E107L]
 Last week Brent crude traded close to $120 per barrel, its
highest in more than two years, due to concerns that political
upheaval in Libya would spread across oil-producing nations in
the Middle East.

 Spot gold rallied to a session peak of $1,430.70 an ounce
-- its highest since Dec. 7, when it hit a record $1,430.95.
 Gold in February staged its largest monthly rise since last
August, as the turmoil in the Middle East fed demand for
perceived safe-haven assets.
 ""What gold needed was a catalyst. It found it in the form
of tensions that are surfacing in the Middle East and rising
oil prices, which served as an inflationary threat and also led
to political instability,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist of Janney Montgomery Scott, which manages $53

 U.S. Treasury prices slipped as profit-taking unwound some
of the market's recent safe-haven rally.

yields at 3.41 percent from 3.43 percent late on Monday.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.01
percent.
 The euro gave up gains against the dollar after Bernanke
noted in his remarks that downside risks to growth have
declined and the risk of deflation was negligible. 
 Helping to support the view that China's monetary
tightening was beginning to register, data from China showed
manufacturing growth slowed in February while costs jumped.
Analysts said more tightening would probably be needed to cool
inflation due largely to rising oil and food prices.

 NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a
3-1/2-month low against a basket of other major currencies on
Tuesday and could fall further after Federal Reserve chief Ben
Bernanke offered no hint that the U.S. central bank was
considering tightening its loose monetary policy.
 After briefly dipping below $1.38, the euro rebounded and
remained on track to test key resistance around $1.3862, the
2011 peak. Analysts expect the euro to stay supported ahead of
Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting, at which the
ECB may signal a willingness to hike rates.

said Alan Ruskin, global head of Group of 10 foreign exchange
strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, fell to
76.735, its weakest level since early November.
 The euro last traded little changed at $1.3806 ,
still near a one-month high of $1.3857 hit on trading platform
EBS on Monday. The euro fell as low as $1.3795 after Bernanke's

the Feb. 28 high.

(Adds detail on U.S. pledge to intensify efforts)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - Nearly a decade of work to
forge a new world trade deal risks becoming irrelevant unless
fast-growing developing countries like China, Brazil and India
make better offers to open their markets, U.S. President Barack
Obama's administration said on Tuesday.
 ""For these talks to remain relevant, they must address the
world as it is and as it will be in the coming decades,"" the
U.S. Trade Representative's office said in an annual report to
outline the president's trade agenda.
 ""The global rules for trade need updating to reflect the
rise of the emerging economic powers,"" USTR said.
 The Doha Round of world trade talks was launched in 2001
with the goal of helping poor countries prosper through trade.
Since the start, it has been vexed by disagreements over how
much the United States and the EU should cut farm subsidies and
tariffs and how much major developing countries should open
their markets in exchange.
 Earlier this year, top trade negotiators set a new goal to
reach a deal by the end of 2011. But World Trade Organization
Director Pascal Lamy recently warned the pace of talks has been
too slow to reach that deadline.
 The Obama administration on Monday pledged to ""intensify
efforts"" to reach a deal this year and said accomplishing that
would require making agricultural, industrial goods and
services markets around the world ""much more open.""
 The United States, which is struggling to generate the
economic growth needed to create jobs and bring down a
stubbornly high unemployment rate, argued in the report that
the world is a much different place than when the talks began.
 ""The remarkable growth of emerging economies like China,
India, and Brazil has fundamentally changed the landscape - and
their growth is projected to continue in the coming years,""
USTR said.
 ""In a negotiation in which the United States is being
asked to significantly cut tariffs on all industrial and
agricultural goods, we are asking these emerging
economies to accept responsibility commensurate with their
expanded roles in the global economy,"" USTR said.

 * WTO report rebukes China on export restrictions

 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, March 1 (Reuters) - Confidential World Trade
Organization findings on China's export limits on raw materials
have boosted the case for a European Union challenge to Chinese
export curbs on rare earths, sources say.
 ""China has export restrictions on raw materials that are
questionable, according to the WTO,"" a source familiar with the
case said on Tuesday. ""So that will be taken seriously when the
EU considers China's restrictions on rare earths too.""
 The EU's executive Commission last year started screening
the legality of plans by China to cut back exports of rare
earths, which are minerals crucial to production of high-tech
goods from fibreoptic cables to smartphones and electric cars.
 China, whose mines supply 97 percent of the world's rare
earths, says export reductions aim to protect the environment
and scarce resources -- an argument that would comply with world
trade rules enforced by the WTO.
 But trade sources say a confidential, preliminary report by
the WTO found flaws in similar reasoning used by China in an
ongoing legal fight to defend its export restrictions on raw
materials such as bauxite and magnesium, used to produce steel,
aluminium and chemical products.
 The EU, United States and Mexico sued China at the WTO in
2009, complaining that limiting exports of these raw materials
through quotas and red tape discriminated against foreign
manufacturers and gave Chinese producers an unfair advantage.
 The WTO -- which rarely comments on current disputes -- has
publicly questioned whether Chinese curbs on exports of some raw
materials to conserve resources meet the stated goals or merely
favour Chinese manufacturers.
 Its preliminary report, which has been handed to the parties
to the raw materials dispute, is confidential until publication
in April. Both sides can then appeal. If China loses it will
have to make amendments to export controls to avoid penalties.
 The United States said last month there was a possibility of
a U.S. challenge on Chinese rare earth exports at the WTO.

growth.
 Gold hit three-month highs as escalating violence in Libya

 Spot gold rose to a session peak at $1,423.65 an ounce --
its highest since Dec. 7 when it hit a record high of
$1,430.95. The metal was up 0.8 percent at $1,421.95 an ounce
by 1533 GMT from $1,410.85 late in New York on Monday.
 ""What we're seeing in Libya, the region as a whole, makes
people want to hold gold,"" said Robin Bhar, an analyst at
Credit Agricole, adding the metal could hit a new peak ""as soon
as this week.""
 Gold in February staged its largest monthly rise since last
August, as the turmoil in the Middle East fed demand for
perceived safe-haven assets.
 Copper  traded at $9,815.50 a tonne at 1603 GMT,
down from a close of $9,885 on Monday. The metal used in power
and construction earlier reached a two-week high at $9,942 a
tonne, nearing record peaks of $10,190 a tonne from Feb. 15.
 U.S. Treasury prices on Tuesday slipped as profit-taking
unwound some of the market's recent safe-haven rally.
 Benchmark 10-year notes  were down 8/32, their
yields at 3.46 percent from 3.43 percent late on Monday.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.08
percent after earlier hitting a 3-1/2-month low.
 The euro gave up gains against the dollar after Bernanke
noted in his remarks that downside risks to growth have
declined and the risk of deflation was negligible. 
 Helping to support the view that China's monetary
tightening was beginning to register, data out of that country
showed manufacturing growth slowed in February while costs
jumped. Analysts said more tightening would probably be needed
to cool inflation due largely to rising oil and food prices.

(Adds new detail, updates markets)
 By Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, March 1 (Reuters) - Hungary unveiled steps on
Tuesday to cut its budget deficit and debt in a plan which
should keep investors on board for the time being although its
execution will be closely scrutinised.
 Markets' initial reaction to the plans was slightly negative
as investors had hoped the government would lay out detailed
plans for structural reforms and were disappointed to find scant
detail on how spending would be reduced.
 However, the headline numbers and the cabinet's apparent
willingness to tackle ""sacred cows"" in social spending such as
disability pensions and early retirement was promising, analysts
said.
 ""Although ambitious target saving numbers are announced, the
plan does not include any concrete measures to support this but
only deadlines by when the Economy Ministry will need to come up
with concrete measures,"" said Gyula Toth at Unicredit.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said the government would
take measures to improve the budget balance by 900 billion
forints by 2013, and drive down public debt to 65-70 percent of
GDP by the end of 2014 from around 80 percent now.
 He said he expected the budget deficit to decline to 2.2
percent of GDP by 2013, below the European Union's 3 percent
ceiling.
 The centre-right government, which shocked stability-loving
investors last year with unorthodox measures, has bought time to
work out its plans in detail, and has probably averted a
downgrade in Hungary's credit rating to ""junk"", analysts said.
 But markets will closely follow the plan's implementation.
 The forint has risen since December in anticipation of the
reforms, which investors hoped would put the budget on a strong
footing before ""crisis"" taxes imposed by the government expire
in 2013.
 Matolcsy said measures would include a review of disability
pensions and early retirement -- taboo for many years -- as well
as the state drug subsidy system, but would also include keeping
the bank tax fully in place in 2012, contrary to earlier plans.
 A document released on the government website kormany.hu
revealed the cabinet targeted substantial savings from drug,
pension, employment-related and public transport costs.
 It also showed the government was not planning to use more
proceeds from the sale of pension assets to plug budget holes in
2012-2014, after a one-off in 2011.
 The forint eased to 272.70 to the euro by 1445 GMT from
270.80 and bond yields jumped 10 basis points on the long end,
as lack of details on the exact measures disappointed markets,
prompting profit taking after a recent rally.
 Stocks of pharmaceutical firms Egis and Richter plunged on
fears they will be hit by an expected cut in state drug
subsidies, while OTP Bank sold off on news of a bank tax
extension.
 Analysts' initial reaction to the plan was mildly positive,
with their focus mainly on the reduction of Hungary's debt,
although some noted that implementation would carry risks.
 ""The size of the package is positive for investors -- even
if it's partly optical tuning it could sell well to investors,""
said Matyas Kovacs, analyst at Raiffeisen.
 ""Its composition is less favourable as the bank tax will
remain in place in 2012. And that the corporate tax rate will
not be reduced in 2013-2014 could be another negative sign for
investors,"" he added.
 
 BOND SALE TO COME?
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government roiled markets last
year by eschewing International Monetary Fund advice in favour
of cash-grabbing measures.
 The government has promised to boost the economy and carry
out long-overdue structural reforms to improve competitiveness.
 Hungary plans total foreign currency bond issuance of 4
billion euros this year to finance expiring debt and repay 2
billion euros of a loan from the EU, and some analysts said the
government could go ahead with a foreign currency bond issue
soon after Tuesday's announcements.
 All three credit rating agencies have said they could cut
Hungary's debt to junk level from just above if the plan is not
credible, so markets will be closely watching their assessment.
 The government said the structural reforms and reduction in
debt should lead to lower risk premia on Hungarian assets which
should enable the central bank to lower its interest rates.
 The ruling Fidesz party -- which is due to nominate four new
rate setters for the Monetary Council by next week -- has
criticised the bank for keeping rates too high.

 By Alonso Soto and Luciana Lopez
 BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, March 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's trade
surplus jumped in February but undershot market expectations as
imports outpaced exports toward the end of the month.
 Brazil posted a trade surplus  of $1.199
billion in February, the trade ministry said on Tuesday.
 That's a jump from both the $423 million surplus in January
this year and the $389 million surplus in the previous
February.
 The country was expected to post a trade surplus of $2.1
billion, according to the median forecast of 10 economists
surveyed by Reuters. Estimates ranged from $1.5 billion to $2.3
billion.
 Imports in February rose to $15.534 billion from $14.791
billion in the previous month, while exports edged up to
$16.733 billion from $15.214 billion.
 Imports especially rose in the fourth week of the month,
when Brazil brought in more goods than it exported, eroding the
trade surplus.
 ""Despite that deficit I think the February figure was
good,"" said Andre Perfeito, chief economist with Gradual
Investimentos.
 ""When you take into consideration that it is unlikely the
real will strengthen much more and that activity has to slow
down, then import figures should have a benign trend,"" he
added. Economists generally expect Brazil's economy to cool
from a breakneck pace last year that the country's finance
minister has called ""excessive.""
 Brazil's strong real  has eaten into the trade
surplus, with Brazilians using their ramped-up purchasing power
to buy more imports and spend more abroad.
 The world's No. 2 soybean exporter and major iron-ore
producer saw its trade surplus shrink nearly 20 percent in 2010
from the previous year to $20.278 billion. [ID:nN03180173]
 The government has increasingly intervened in the currency
market to try to brake the currency's gains, but some analysts
remain skeptical of the long-term results.
 Central banks across the region have started to raise
interest rates in a bid to temper local currencies surging on
the back of tremendous growth supported by booming commodity
prices and robust domestic demand.
 On Monday, officials announced cuts to the country's budget
in an attempt to withdraw fiscal stimulus and cool the heated
economy. [ID:nN28242976]
 But central bank policy-makers are expected to raise their
benchmark interest rate to 11.75 percent from 11.25 percent on
Wednesday in a bid to rein in consumer prices. A rate hike
would likely boost the currency further.

 NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower early
on Tuesday, and oil prices regained ground, fanning worries
about their effect on economic growth.
 World equities, measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, were lower, falling 0.1 percent. It
ended February up 2.8 percent.
 The U.S. dollar fell to fresh 3 1/2-month lows against

lower.
 U.S. stocks, which are up about 26 percent since the start

rose in February.
 ""If gas prices go higher that will put a damper on things,""
said Douglas Lane, president of the New York-based Douglas C.

 NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a
fresh 3-1/2-month low against major currencies and could weaken
further should Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterate
his support for loose monetary policy in his testimony on
Tuesday.
 Expectations the Fed will lag other major central banks in
raising interest rates have pressured the U.S. currency,
pushing the euro close to a 2011 high and sterling to its
strongest level in more than a year.
 The euro could rise above resistance around $1.3862, its
yearly high, setting the stage for a rally toward $1.40, if
Bernanke stays cautious about the economy and relatively
relaxed about inflation at his semi-annual appearance before
the Senate Banking Committee, starting at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT)
 ""If Bernanke remains cautious on the prospects of U.S.
recovery signaling that the Fed will maintain its accommodative
monetary policy for the foreseeable future, risk currencies
could rally further,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
currency research at GFT in New York.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, fell to 76.735, its
weakest level since early November.
 The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3812 , near a
one-month high of $1.3857 hit on trading platform EBS on
Monday.
 Traders reported stop losses above $1.3860, which is around
euro/dollar's 2011 high set on Feb. 2 and a break above which
would mark the highest since early November. Further upside
targets include $1.3948, around the 76.4 percent retracement of
the euro's fall from November to January, and $1.3957, the
200-week moving average.
 The euro will likely stay supported ahead of an
interest-rate meeting by the European Central Bank on Thursday,
at which it may signal a willingness to raise rates. See
[ID:nLDE71R1Y8]
 ""The market has increasingly built in a shift in stance,
the risk is that the ECB fails to deliver and the euro
weakens,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""However we expect that the
fundamentals have shifted enough that President (Jean-Claude)
Trichet will not disappoint.""
 YEN, FRANC DIP
 The Swiss franc and yen slipped as concern about North
Africa and the Middle East eased in the absence of any
significant escalation of tensions and oil prices stayed below
last week's highs.
 Uncertainties in the region remained, however, and analysts
said that if tensions escalate investors could again buy the
Swiss franc and yen, the two currencies which have tended to
benefit most when market players have sought safety.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.20 yen , with
traders citing heavy buying of dollar/yen by Japanese
exporters. The euro rose 0.7 percent to 113.59 yen .
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was up 0.3 percent at
0.9316  and the euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2875
.
 Sterling  rallied to a 13-month high against the
dollar of $1.6330, after stronger-than-expected UK housing data
stoked expectations the Bank of England will raise interest
rates before the Fed.
 The Canadian dollar rose to a three-week high versus the
U.S. currency, helped by high oil prices and broad weakness in
the greenback. The U.S. dollar fell as low as C$0.9684
, before rebounding to C$0.9728 after the Bank of
Canada kept its main interest rate at 1 percent and gave no
signal it plans to push it up soon. [ID:nLDE7201U4]

 LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Popular revolts across the
resource-rich Middle East and North Africa may transform the
management of windfall oil wealth, potentially denting national
balance sheets, boosting inflation and disturbing world markets.
 The region's state-owned funds, managing almost $1 trillion
of assets -- equivalent to nearly two-thirds of the entire hedge
fund industry -- have been a key driver in financial markets,
making wide-ranging investments including stakes in blue chips
such as UniCredit and luxury department store Harrods.
 But political turmoil is rapidly changing the landscape for
oil wealth management, prompting governments to spend more at
home to appease angry protestors than invest overseas.
Using oil windfall revenues for potentially inflationary
pump-priming or even wealth redistribution may slow or even halt
the accumulation of resource wealth in the long run.
 This could hit national balance sheets and removes a key
support factor for credit ratings. It may also disrupt world
financial markets, whose strong recovery since the crisis was
partly underpinned by petrodollar demand for risky assets.
 Last week, Saudi Arabia unveiled benefits worth some $37
billion, in an apparent bid to insulate the world's top oil
exporter from an Arab protest wave.
 Bahrain, Libya, Oman and Kuwait have also increased domestic
spending or handed outright cash to its citizens in packages
totalling as much as 4 percent of gross domestic product.
 ""In the long term, we will probably see a meaningful shift
in the balance between hydrocarbon revenues that are saved and
invested overseas and those that are deployed at home,"" said
Andrew Rozanov, head of sovereign advisory at Permal.
 ""Recent events in the region are refocusing people's minds
rather urgently on new spending on domestic investment and
welfare needs to maintain peace and social cohesion.""
 Among these countries which increased domestic spending,
Saudi Arabia's is by far the biggest. Its spending plan,
financed by its foreign exchange reserves, includes pay rises,
unemployment benefits and affordable family housing.
 ""If oil prices stay sufficiently high to finance it, this
will simply slow the growth of sovereign portfolios in the
future. If, on the other hand, oil prices come down
significantly, then certain funds may be required to make some
adjustments to accommodate increased spending,"" Rozanov said.

 BALANCE SHEET IMPACT
 Vast oil wealth is a key factor underpinning credit ratings
in resource-rich but politically vulnerable countries which have
high youth unemployment.
 Libya, for example, is rated BBB by Fitch Ratings -- higher
than Egypt's BB. Gulf countries are all rated A or above.
 But the protests have already had fiscal consequences.
 Fitch expects even before the latest steps, Bahrain's
already expansionary measures would more than double its gross
debt to 38 percent of GDP by 2012 from 2008.
 ""The credit ratings for some of the hydro-carbon rich
sovereigns in the region have long been held down due to
concerns about social and political factors like high
unemployment or the absence of voice and accountability,"" said
Purvi Harlalka, director at Fitch.
 ""From a purely balance-sheet point of view, they look
strong. However, now that the social and political risks that
were factored into the rating have manifested, they have real
and visible economic costs that further impact
creditworthiness.""
 
 DUTCH DISEASE
 For global capital markets, a sudden change in a country's
wealth management policy or the environment surrounding their
investment could trigger a sell-off and volatility.
 Moves by U.S., UK and European authorities to freeze Libya's
state assets and a sell-off in shares of Unicredit, 2.6 percent
owned by the Libyan Investment Authority, illustrate this point.
 The redirection of oil wealth to domestic industries may
have other downsides.
 Sovereign wealth funds in resource economies do not exist
only to invest for future generations but also to diversify
their economies and avoid so-called ""Dutch disease"".
 Rapid oil sector growth could make other industries less
competitive and lead to lower growth than those with fewer
natural resources -- as seen in the 1960s Dutch economic crisis
following the discovery of North Sea natural gas.
 Home investment is often seen by sovereign funds as
something of a taboo, except in a severe economic downturn,
because the domestic recycling of the surplus risks fanning
inflation and discouraging competitiveness.
 For this reason, certain SWFs such as Norway and Azerbaijan
are not allowed to invest domestically.
 ""If we see a boom in local investments for internal needs,
you might see a rise in inflation. Many of the decisions will be
influenced more by immediate political needs than long-term
economic plans,"" said Efraim Chalamish, an SWF expert and
adjunct Professor at New York University.

(Writes through with results from Rotork, Elementis, others)
 By Adveith Nair and Isabel Coles 
 LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Demand for steel and chemicals
in resource-hungry emerging markets and a weaker pound helped
boost a string of British manufacturing companies, results
showed on Tuesday, more than offsetting a tepid domestic market.
 Rotork and Cookson Group both cited strong overseas demand
as a key driver behind profit rises in 2010 and said they would
deliver even better results in 2011. 
 In a further sign the sector is thriving, British
manufacturing growth held at a record level in February, data
showed on Tuesday.
 British Prime Minister David Cameron has been on a
diplomatic drive to drum up trade, counting on private sector
growth, and exports in particular, to offset the impact of
public sector spending cuts on an already sluggish economy.
 But February's Purchasing Managers' Index also pointed to
mounting price pressures, which may heighten calls for the Bank
of England to raise interest rates sooner rather than later and
mark an end to the competitive benefits of a weak pound.
 Rotork, whose adjusted pretax profit for the year rose 9
percent to 99.6 million pounds ($162.2 million), said the
pound's appreciation could hurt.
 ""Following several years of favourable movements in foreign
exchange, currency may provide a headwind in the current year,""
Rotork said in a statement.
 
 GLOBAL TRADE 
 But stronger sterling is unlikely to derail the recovery on
its own, analysts say.
 ""Sterling's competitiveness versus the euro is probably
helping export orders, but there does appear to be a Europe-wide
strengthening in the manufacturing sector, most likely driven by
global trade,"" said Philip Shaw at Investec.
 Industrial materials firm Cookson's profit nearly trebled in
2010, on revenue 30 percent higher, of which at least 50 percent
came from emerging markets in the Asia Pacific, Brazil, India,
and Eastern Europe.
 ""Those economies have been growing strongly and our
end-markets in those economies growing with it,"" Cookson Chief
Executive Nick Salmon told Reuters in an interview.
 The company also reinstated its dividend, two years after
suspending payouts due to a slump in steel demand which was a
major factor in a 57 percent drop in the company's 2009 profit.
 ""Obviously the growth in revenue in part is flattered by the
recovery from the economic crisis, but nonetheless these results
are well ahead of 2008 as well,"" Salmon said.
 Chemicals maker Elementis also highlighted its growing
exposure to China as its shares also got a lift from a surge in
profits.
 ""Asia Pacific based acquisitions ... have proven
instrumental in providing Elementis with a powerful growth
platform in Asia Pacific,"" Chief Executive Daivd Dutro wrote to
shareholders, noting that it is now the biggest sales region at
its Specialty Products division with 20 percent growth in 2010.
 ""Asia Pacific is a key component of our future growth
strategy,"" Dutro added.
 Elsewhere, plane parts makers GKN and Meggitt said civil
aerospace orders were likely to grow in the coming year.

 (Updates prices, adds quotes, inflation)
 ISTANBUL, Mar 1 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira weakened
against the dollar and bond yields edged higher on Tuesday as
investors fretted over the impact of higher oil prices on an
energy hungry, fast-growing economy.
 Stocks also declined after a positive opening, with shares
dipping 0.91 percent to 60,741.05 at 1237 GMT. The MSCI
emerging-markets index rose 0.77 percent.
 After gaining more than emerging peers last year, Turkish
stocks have fallen more than 7 percent since the start of the
year, significantly underperforming markets such as Russia or
central Europe due to concerns about the central bank's strategy
and a spiralling current account deficit.
 ""The equity market remains an underperformer due to a number
of uncertainties stemming from the central bank's monetary
policy and, more recently, Middle East and North African unrest
and its effect on oil prices,"" said Stuart Hackett, a trader at
EkspresInvest in Istanbul.
 Turkey imports 95 percent of its oil needs.
 The lira eased to 1.6060 to the dollar from a previous close
of 1.5985.
 Fuelled by speculation that the central bank will raise
banks' reserve requirements to curb credit growth when its
policy committee meets later this month, the yield on the
benchmark Nov 7, 2012 bond rose to 8.85 from 8.78 percent.
 The central bank, which held rates last month after cutting
them in December and January while raising banks' reserve
requirements to absorb extra liquidity, has said it now wants to
give its policies time to work.
 But a sharp increase in the January trade deficit, reported
on Monday, raised expectations that the central bank would do
more to curb consumer loan demand.
 Weekly data released by the banking watchdog (BDDK) on
Monday showed loans were up 35.6 percent year-on-year and 2.8
percent since the start of 2011.
 A BDDK official told Reuters on Tuesday that the regulator
is warning banks whose loans are growing particularly fast as it
seeks to keep credit growth within the 20-25 percent in 2011.
 Investors are anxious the bank could fall behind the curve
in fighting inflation without further monetary tightening,
including rate hikes.
 While consumer price inflation reached its lowest levels in
more then 40 years in January, producer price inflation is
running much higher.
 Retail prices in Istanbul rose 0.57 percent month-on-month
in February, while wholesale prices increased 2.42 percent, the
Istanbul Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday. In January retail
prices had declined. The government's nationwide inflation data
for February will be released on Thursday.
 On Tuesday, the Statistics Office reported unemployment in
Turkey fell to 11.9 percent in 2010 from 14 percent a year
earlier -- positive news for the AK Party government as it moves
closer to an election set for June 12.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2011 07:48AM ET</span>",Signs UK growth picked up at start of 2011 -BoE's King," LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Britain's economy appears to
have rebounded at the start of the year after December's
weather-related disruption, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King
said on Tuesday.
 King was giving evidence to lawmakers hours after data
showed British manufacturing growth matched January's record
high last month and mortgage lending picked up in January.
 Britain's economy suffered a shock 0.6 percent contraction
in the fourth quarter, much of which was due to severe weather
in December which closed businesses and left many Britons
stranded at home.
 Minutes from the BoE's last policy meeting showed three of
the nine committee members voted for an immediate interest rate
rise and others were prepared to consider supporting one if the
recovery appeared more assured after the fourth quarter dip.
""Surveys that we have for the beginning of this year suggest
that activity did pick up in the first part of this year,"" King
said.
 ""The nature of the recovery with the rebalancing going on
means that it is quite likely that this recovery will be, in the
phrase I used some months ago, choppy.""
 King said the central bank was monitoring inflation
expectations closely but there was no clear evidence yet that
medium term inflation expectations had risen.
 He acknowledged that oil prices had risen much faster than
the BoE had assumed in last month's inflation projections but
noted that some of the factors driving prices -- such as
tensions in the Middle East -- could drive inflation down as
well as up.
 ""An awful lot will hinge on how far this rise in oil prices
persists, whether the situation in the Middle East becomes
clarified and it falls back again,"" he said.
 ""These are very uncertain factors, these are the things that
do move inflation around, not just up but down too.""

 LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The dollar hit its lowest in
three-and-a-half months versus a currency basket on Tuesday on
the view U.S. monetary policy will remain loose, as the market
awaited testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 With other central banks seeming likely to hike interest
rates, analysts said the dollar could extend falls if Bernanke
stays cautious about the economy and relatively relaxed about
inflation at his semi-annual appearance before the Senate
Banking Committee, starting at 1500 GMT.
 Meanwhile, expectations of higher rates in the euro zone and
UK pushed the euro close to its 2011 high against the dollar of
$1.3862 and sterling to its highest in more than a year.
 The euro was expected to remain supported ahead of
Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting, at which it may
signal a willingness to raise rates. [ID:nLDE71R1Y8]
 ""Interest rate differentials are likely to continue to drive
markets, and although Bernanke should acknowledge improvements
in the economy he is unlikely to change his stance in the short
term,"" said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, fell to 76.735, its
weakest level since early November.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3817 , close to a
one-month high of $1.3857 hit on trading platform EBS on Monday.
A break of its February high just above there, at around
$1.3862, would mark the currency's highest since early November.
 Traders reported stop losses above $1.3860, while technical
analysts said there was key resistance around $1.3948, the 76.4
percent retracement of the euro's fall from November to January.
 ""Upside in euro/dollar is likely to depend on Bernanke. The
first level is the 2011 high, and once this breaks we could see
a test of $1.40 but for this to happen we would need (ECB
President Jean-Claude) Trichet to be quite hawkish on Thursday,""
said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Traders said the single currency could struggle to extend
gains without a further catalyst, however, with offers reported
around $1.3865-70 and barriers at $1.3900, $1.3950 and $1.4000.
 Sterling  rallied to a 13-month high against the
dollar of $1.6330, supported by firm UK data [ID:nLDE7200TA] and
market expectations the Bank of England will raise interest
rates before the Fed. It later eased back to $1.6269, up 0.1
percent on the day.
 The Canadian dollar  also hit a three-year high of
C$0.9699 per U.S. dollar, taking out an option barrier at
C$0.9700, helped by high oil prices and broad weakness in the
greenback.

 YEN DIPS
 The dollar was steady against the Swiss franc and was able
to rally against the yen as concern about North Africa and the
Middle East eased in the absence of any significant escalation
of tensions and oil prices stayed below last week's highs.
 Uncertainties in the region remained, however, and analysts
said that if tensions heighten investors could again buy the
Swiss franc and yen, the two currencies which have tended to
benefit most when market players have sought safety.
 Versus the yen , the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 82.09
yen , hovering near the middle of its roughly 81 yen to 84
yen range seen over the past month. Traders earlier cited heavy
buying of dollar/yen by Japanese exporters. 
 The Australian dollar  flat on the day at $1.0184,
close to a two-month high of $1.0203 hit in Asian trade which
could leave it poised to test the multi-decade high of $1.0257
hit late last year. Earlier, the Reserve Bank of Australia kept
interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent, as expected.

 (Adds Finance Minister comment, background)
 By Anna Ringstrom
 STOCKHOLM, March 1 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy grew at a
record pace in the fourth quarter, data showed on Tuesday,
accelerating further ahead of other European countries and
bolstering the case for quicker interest rate hikes this year.
 Gross domestic product grew 1.2 percent from the third
quarter, and 7.3 percent from a year earlier -- the fastest on
record and backed by strong exports and rising consumption. It
beat economists' median forecasts in a Reuters poll for 1.0
percent and 7.0 percent respectively.
 Year-on-year growth was the fastest in Europe.
 The economy grew 5.5 percent in 2010, the biggest rise since
at least 1970, as it put behind it a 5.3 percent contraction
suffered in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.
 The Swedish crown strengthened marginally after the GDP
figures to around 8.715 to the euro at 1125 GMT from around
8.722 shortly before the data.
 But with the economy firing on all cylinders, worries have
grown that a rapid rise in household lending and soaring house
prices could leave the Nordic country facing a new crisis in the
shape of a bursting housing bubble.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg stressed at a parliamentary
hearing the need to raise capital requirements on the country's
banks -- the biggest of which are Nordea, Handelsbanken,
Swedbank and SEB.
 ""It is reasonable, from the perspective of the banks, to
expect that we will tighten capital requirements by about a
percentage point per year in the coming years,"" he said at
hearing in parliament.
 ""It must first and foremost be a question about boosting
core capital, he added.
 
 STRONG RECOVERY
 Sweden, which relies heavily on exports, bounced back
relatively quickly from its worst recession since World War Two,
helped by firming global demand for capital goods, low interest
rates, strong public finances and tax cuts.
 Interest rates have now come off record lows hit during 2009
and the crown has recovered its pre-crisis strength and more.
 ""Exports don't seem to have had a negative impact from the
firmer crown,"" Nordea economist Bengt Rostrom said, noting that
the annual growth rate accelerated more than the central bank
had seen. ""This probably strengthens the Riksbank's plans for
rate hikes.""
 The statistics office said household consumption increased
4.3 percent from the third quarter while exports increased 13
percent. It said changes in inventories amounted to a positive
GDP change of 1.5 percentage points.
 Swedbank economist Per Sellden said Sweden has had a
remarkable recovery.
 ""We were very much affected by the crisis, more than others.
Nevertheless, the recovery went very fast in Sweden and it may
have something to do with the weaker krona -- the momentum is
still there in Swedish production. We have been fairly lucky
with the mix of products that we have in Sweden,"" he said.
 Growth is expected to slow from exceptionally high levels in
coming quarters as export growth dips and inventories normalise.
 
 CREDIT GROWTH
 The strength in the Swedish economy has however been
somewhat clouded by worries over rapid household lending growth
and the prospect of a housing market bubble.
 The Riksbank, which has raised rates at five straight
meetings to stem inflationary pressure and rapid credit growth,
is expected to continue to tighten policy through this year.
 Central bank Governor Stefan Ingves told the parliamentary
hearing on Tuesday it remained to be seen whether current
measures to rein in credit growth would suffice but that the
housing market appeared to have entered a calmer phase.
 Financial Markets Minister Peter Norman pointed to the case
of Switzerland which has introduced tougher requirements than
those planned under the new global Basel III capital requirement
rules, saying it was an ""interesting example"".
 In Switzerland, data showed on Tuesday that the Swiss
economy grew 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2011 06:44AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Is silver supply gold dust after miners hedge?," * Near-term silver supply dries up
 * Investors bet on more price gains
 * Watch Chinese imports, analysts say
 
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The silver market has greeted
the revival of forward sales by miners with sanguinity as prices
sit at 31-year highs, but other signals suggest supply may
really be scarce and investors are poised for more price gains.
 The cost of borrowing metal in three months' time is around
its highest in 22 months and traders and analysts believe at
least five major miners have hedged their future sales by
locking in prices that are around 31-year highs.
 While the ""H-word"" might leave a sour taste in some mouths
for chronically depressing the spot price years ago, the market
has not taken it this time as particularly negative.
 U.S. silver futures' curve has inverted so nearby prices are
above those for future delivery, a structure known as
backwardation that can reflect a strain on supply of metal.
 Yet the silver market has been in surplus for years, largely
from rising output from secondary producers -- those that mine
the metal with base metals or gold.
 Demand, with traditional photography in decay, cannot absorb
excess supply.
 So very few in the market have really bought the notion that
near-term supply is anything other than plentiful. Until now.
 ""We have been a bit surprised by the extent of the
backwardation that's developed and how it's gone from being a
longer-dated phenomenon ... to being a backwardation at the
front of the curve as well is suggesting there is a shortage of
metal out there,"" said Natixis commodity strategist Nic Brown.
 Silver stocks in COMEX warehouses are near their lowest
since April 2006, when the silver price was closer to $5.00 an
ounce and coin demand has picked up, particularly in the United
States, where it hit a record in January.
 GFMS, a consultancy, estimates global silver demand will
reach 885 million ounces this year, and supply will rise by 90
million ounces from 889 million in 2009, leaving the market in a
small surplus.
 
 INVESTOR FLURRY
 Total open interest in COMEX silver futures posted its
biggest rise in February since September, driven by a 55-million
ounce rise in the net position held by speculators, as reflected
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
 ""There is a unique confluence of factors coming together
that should play out eventually, but it depends on how much or
how quickly stocks can now come to market to ease the physical
tightness,"" said Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar.
 When lease rates spiked in January, the world's biggest
exchange-traded silver fund, the iShares Silver Trust saw its
largest outflow of metal since its inception in 2006.
 ""It's no real surprise that in the presence of this
substantial backwardation, you've got people who prefer to own
silver in futures rather than in its physical form,"" Natixis'
Brown said.
 ""But it does continually beg the question of where is all
this silver going? Is it purely a reflection of the hedging
that's going on or is there a more substantial factor that is
leading to the apparent shortage in the market? Either way, the
the market is telling you there is not enough metal out there.""
 The silver price has risen 9 percent this year, outpacing
gold and building on 2010's 80-percent gain, driven partly by
safe-haven buying from investors deterred by the high price of
gold as turmoil escalates in the Middle East.
 One of the great hopes of the silver bulls is the rise in
demand for the metal from solar power, where it is used in
photovoltaic cells in panels that turn sunlight into energy.
 Barclays Capital says assuming around 0.1 g of silver are
used for each watt of power generated and each solar panel has a
capacity of 200 watts, up to 2,000 tonnes of silver may have
gone into PV cells last year.
 As with most other industrial commodities, analysts will
scour import data from top raw materials consumer China to gauge
demand for the metal from solar energy.
 China is among the world's largest suppliers of panels, but
uses little of what it produces domestically. Solar power has a
notoriously uncertain future, as governments in top markets such
as Germany and Spain cut subsidies.
 ""There is little doubt that PV demand is becoming more
important to the silver market,"" said UBS stragest Edel Tully.
""But don't get carried away: while the long-term prspects for
cell production expansion are very positive, the sector's
dependence on government largesse sugests that near-term
expectations may need to be held in check.""
 Indeed, Chinese imports fell to three month-lows in January.
 While the market seems to agree that the current constraint
on supply is transient, its impact on the notoriously volatile
silver price might not be.
 ""In the silver market, there is enough silver, it is more to
do with a short-term squeeze,"" said Standard Bank analyst Walter
de Wet. ""If you're long silver, stay long, but it's probably not
worth the risk/reward getting in now,"" he said.
 ""It's not called the devil's metal for nothing.""

 The dollar was up against the Swiss franc and the yen,

 Uncertainties in the region remained, however, and analysts

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2011 06:24AM ET</span>",GLOBAL ECONOMY-Pipeline inflation pressures rising sharply," * Euro zone manufacturing growth at 10-year high
 * China factory growth slows in Feb; India accelerates
 * Factory costs rise around the world
 * Inflation risks point to more policy tightening
 
 By Jonathan Cable and Kevin Yao
 LONDON/BEIJING, March 1 (Reuters) - Factory input costs
leapt across the globe in February, the latest sign of rising
inflationary pressures, while euro zone manufacturing grew at
its fastest in nearly 10 years, surveys showed on Tuesday.
 British manufacturing also grew strongly, at its fastest
pace in nearly two decades, and Indian factory growth
accelerated. But in China, where the authorities have raised
rates and bank reserve requirements multiple times since last
year, factory growth slipped to its slowest pace in six months.
 Overall, the February purchasing managers' indexes provide
the latest evidence of growing inflationary pressure from a
sharp rise in commodity prices. Crude oil prices hit 2-1/2 year
highs last week on supply concerns after uprisings in Libya.
 ""With the latest surge in commodity prices yet to fully feed
through into consumer prices, inflation could well climb further
in the next few months,"" said Martin van Vliet at ING.
 The output price index in the 17-nation euro zone hit a
record high for the survey, which was conducted Feb. 11-21
before oil prices spiked again last week.
 The head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, warned on Monday that global economic growth could
suffer if the rise in oil prices, now well above $100 a barrel,
were sustained for a long period.
 Official euro zone data also showed consumer prices rose 2.4
percent year-on-year last month, considerably above the European
Central Bank's target of just below two percent.
 The European Commission upped its inflation forecasts for
the bloc, now expecting prices to rise 2.2 percent this year
compared to their previous 1.8 percent forecast.
 The ECB is not expected to exit from the ultra-loose
monetary policy it adopted in the depths of the financial crisis
when it meets on Thursday but economists expect an interest rate
hike by the fourth quarter of this year.
 ""February's flash euro zone CPI figures will do little to
alter the ECB's recent rather more hawkish stance ahead of
Thursday's Council meeting and press conference,"" said Jonathan
Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics.
 The latest European PMIs also showed that manufacturing
growth across the euro zone, which had previously been mainly
driven by Germany's robust economic recovery, picked up in some
economies on the periphery. In debt-stricken Ireland,
manufacturing activity hit an 11-year high.
 A comparable survey for the U.S. from the Institute for
Supply Management, due at 1500 GMT, is expected to show a slight
rise to 61.0 from 60.8, indicating a strong rate of growth.
 But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is expected to say
in Congressional testimony later on Tuesday that the recent rise
in oil prices poses a risk to economic recovery.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 CHINA BRAKES
 China PMIs showed that manufacturing growth slipped to its
slowest pace in at least six months, a sign that the
government's campaign to tame inflation was biting.
 But gauges of factory input prices still hit three-month
highs in both China's official PMI and a private-sector PMI
sponsored by HSBC.
 Many of China's businesses were shut or running at half
speed in the first part of February as China celebrated the
Lunar New Year holiday, making it difficult to draw too many
firm conclusions though the PMIs are on a mild downward trend.
 Since October, when inflation began to pick up, China has
raised banks' required reserves five times to a record high,
increased interest rates three times, and also ordered banks to
lend less.
 Lending by Chinese banks remains excessively fast, topping
the ""extreme upper limit"" set by regulators, the country's
banking chief said at an internal meeting at the start of this
year, a source told Reuters on Tuesday.
 Raw material costs have risen broadly with oil. Worries
abound that a sustained rise in commodity prices, from metals to
grains, could reduce demand and so slow economic activity around
the world.
 India has the highest inflation of any major Asian economy
even after seven rate rises in a year. Factory input prices
there rose at the fastest pace since the records for the PMI
began in 2005.
 ""Manufacturers are facing ever steeper increases in input
costs, reflecting the tightness of labour markets and rising
material costs, which will continue to add upward pressure on
output prices,"" said Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India and
ASEAN at HSBC, which sponsors the index.

 By Ahmed Rasheed
 BAGHDAD, March 1 (Reuters) - Iraq exported an average of
2.202 million barrels per day in February, up from 2.16 million
bpd in January, a senior oil official said on Tuesday, and the
highest export levels since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
 Falah Alamri, head of the State Oil Marketing Organisation
(SOMO), said exports from the northern fields, which included
crude from the country's Kurdish region, rose to 494,000 bpd.
That figure also included 10,000 bpd taken through Jordan via
trucks.
 The bulk of Iraq's oil exports, averaging 1.708 million bpd,
were shipped from the southern oil hub of Basra, Amri said. The
average selling price was around $97 per barrel, he added.
 Iraq's oil production was 2.7 million bpd in January, the
first time it has reached that level in 20 years as investment
increased and violence dropped. It sits on some of the world's
largest crude reserves.
Iraqi Kurdistan resumed oil exports last month following a
halt in 2009 due to a long-standing dispute with the central
government in Baghdad over the legality of contracts it signed
with foreign oil companies.
Exports from fields in the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish
region reached 60,000-70,000 bpd last month.
 Iraq has signed a series of deals with international oil
companies in a bid to boost its production capacity to 12
million bpd in seven years, which could make it a close rival to
global oil giant Saudi Arabia. However, most analysts say 6-7
million bpd is a more realistic target.

rules, saying it was an ""interesting example"".
In Switzerland, data showed on Tuesday that the Swiss economy
grew 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

(Releads with chief executive's comments on expansion)
 By Agnieszka Barteczko and Adrian Krajewski
 WARSAW, March 1 (Reuters) - KGHM, Europe's second biggest
copper producer, aims to become one of the world's top five
producers by 2018 and is considering a dual share listing to
help fund foreign expansion plans, its chief executive said.
 Hoping to continue to benefit from the surge in metal
prices, the state-controlled Polish miner wants to raise its
annual copper output by around a third to ""well above"" 700,000
tonnes in seven years via investments of around 30 billion
zlotys ($10.5 billion), including 7.5 billion set aside for this
year.
 Herbert Wirth said a listing on the Toronto stock exchange
was most likely, which is already known for the large number of
mining companies trading there.
 ""From the perspective of financing greenfield projects, the
Toronto bourse is the best address,"" he said.
 The Toronto Stock Exchange's parent TMX Group is currently
in merger talks with the London Stock Exchange.
 Most of KGHM's current output is produced from mines at home
but last year it revived expansion plans to take advantage of
rising metal prices that it expects to help make a net profit of
around 8.4 billion zlotys ($2.9 billion) this year.
 That would be nearly double the 2010 net profit of 4.57
billion zlotys it reported on Tuesday, beating its own guidance,
which was raised several times last year, as well as analyst
expectations.
 ""KGHM wants to be among the leading producers and move up to
place number five to six in the world,"" Wirth told a news
conference. ""When it comes to silver, we want to be the number
one player.""
 KGHM is currently the ninth largest copper producer and
second largest producer of silver.
 Its shares were up 1.5 percent by 1433 GMT, outperforming a
0.3 percent fall in Warsaw's main WIG20 index.
 The stock rose 63 percent last year as copper prices surged
past the $10,000 a tonne mark, mostly due to demand from China.
 KGHM, which in the past has had mixed success in venturing
outside its home base, last year set up a joint venture with
Abacus Mining to develop its Afton-Ajax copper-gold project in
Kamloops, British Columbia.
 The miner is now in talks with five parties about possible
purchases, including three at an advanced stage, Wirth said, but
did not elaborate.
 
 TELECOMS SALES
 KGHM also plans to sell its Dialog telecoms arm by the end
of June, which would beef up its 2011 bottom line as well as
help secure financing for its plans.
 Wirth said it would send out prospectuses to possible
bidders for Dialog this month and hopes to sell it in the first
half, faster than earlier expectations.
 It is also among the owners of Polkomtel, who put the Polish
cellphone operator up for sale this year.

(Adds fresh analyst comment, PMI data, background)
 By Catherine Bosley and Sven Egenter
 ZURICH, March 1 (Reuters) - The Swiss economy is gaining
more momentum than expected despite the record-high franc,
prompting markets to brace for an earlier interest rate hike.
 The economy posted its strongest performance since late
2007, growing by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 from
the previous quarter, thanks to strong company investment,
government consumption and a rise in exports, the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said on Tuesday.
Economists had expected a slowdown in growth.
 Forward-looking indicators, such as the KOF economic
barometer, have indicated momentum is still picking up and the
Swiss National Bank's chairman has also begun to sound less dour
on growth.
 In yet another sign of the upswing continuing, the Swiss
purchasing managers' index beat expectations and jumped to a
seasonally adjusted 63.5 points in February, indicating the
sector was picking up steam.
 ""The GDP data continue to challenge the SNB's expectation of
a significant slowdown in growth in response to the sharp
appreciation of the exchange rate,"" said BNP Paribas economist
Eoin O'Callaghan.
 ""The longer the economic data defies the SNB's prediction of
a significant slowdown, the more compelling the case for
starting the hiking cycle becomes.""
 The SNB, which so far forecast a slowdown of growth to
around 1.5 percent this year from 2.6 percent in 2010 due to the
franc, holds its next quarterly meeting on March 17. More and
more analysts see the economy growing by more than 2 percent.
 The SNB is seen holding rates for now because inflation is
low, but markets have started bracing for an earlier rate hike
than so far anticipated after a string of upbeat news.
 ""I expect another year of strong growth. Despite the strong
franc, that should open the possibility for the SNB to start
normalising policy from June,"" said Julius Baer economist
Janwillem Acket.
 Interest rate futures price in a high chance of the SNB
raising in September its target for the 3-month franc LIBOR,
which has been at 0.25 percent since March 2009. Until last week
markets were betting on a rate rise in December.
 
 ROBUST EXPORTS
 The franc rose against the euro on the release of the GDP
figures but then weakened again and was trading at 1.2875 at
0913 GMT, off an intra-day high of 1.2816 per euro.
 The euro zone is the top destination for Swiss trade, and a
rise of some 15 percent in the safe-haven franc against the euro
last year made Swiss goods more expensive abroad, prompting
exporters to warn margins were under pressure.
 Yet as Switzerland's single most important export market,
Germany has underpinned Swiss growth and exports in recent
months with its own bouyant economy. In a further sign of
strength, German joblessness fell more than expected in January.

 The Swiss GDP figures were not, however, the strongest in
Europe. Sweden's growth surged 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter
from the third, also trouncing forecasts.
 Swiss exports of goods rose 2.4 percent in the fourth
quarter from the third. The franc's strength did, however, show
up in the exports of services, which fell 5.8 percent.
 Some of the decline in service exports was due to tourism,
Acket said. Swiss hoteliers have been complaining the strong
currency has spoiled the winter skiing season.
 Private consumption grew 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter
from the third. Government consumption increased by 1.2 percent
in that period while company investment rose 6.3 percent and
construction was 1.2 percent stronger.
 Gross domestic product increased by 3.1 percent year-on-year
in the fourth quarter, compared with a forecast of 2.8 percent.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose back above $112
a barrel on Tuesday due to concerns over unrest in the Middle
East, though stock markets shrugged off the move, preferring to
focus on optimism over the outlook for the U.S. economy.
 The upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa helped spot
gold to rise about 0.5 percent to $1,417.85 an ounce, up for a
third straight session. Gold staged its largest monthly rise in
February since last August, as turmoil in the Middle East fed
investor demand for perceived safe-haven assets.
 But European equities tracked gains on Wall Street overnight
and in Asia, with analysts saying markets had turned back to
expectations of a strong U.S. recovery and the prospect of
monetary tightening there being delayed for some time.
 U.S. factory activity is forecast to have expanded again in
February. The Institute for Supply Management index due later in
the day is expected to show a reading of 61.0, up from 60.8 in
January. [ECONUS]
 This follows data on Monday showing consumer spending growth
slowed in January but also painting a bullish picture of the
manufacturing sector, with a gauge of factory activity in the
country's Midwest hitting a 22-1/2 year high.
 ""It's very important that the U.S. economy is now showing
signs of strength ... and forecasts for this year's GDP are
starting to exceed 4 percent,"" said Heino Ruland, strategist at
Ruland Research in Frankfurt.
 ""This is certainly good news for the world economy."" 
 Figures out of China, however, showed manufacturing growth
slowed in February while costs jumped, suggesting monetary
tightening was beginning to register but that more would
probably be needed to cool inflation due largely to rising oil
and food prices. [ID:nBGN1EE7BU]
 U.S. crude for delivery in April  inched up 0.1
percent to $97.08 per barrel.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was last up 0.4
percent, pushing higher for a third consecutive session. The
world equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> added 0.3 percent.
 The firmer tone in equities cooled flows into safer-haven
government bonds, pushing 10-year Treasury and German debt
yields up slightly though losses were limited by lingering
nervousness over developments in North Africa and the Middle
East.
 
 OIL OFF PEAKS
 Crude traded close to $120 per barrel last week, its highest
in more than two years, due to concerns that political upheaval
in Libya would spread across oil-producing nations in the Middle
East. Saudi Arabia has calmed the market with extra supply.
 ""I would expect that the rise in oil prices we've seen so
far, which is more gentle compared to what we saw in the 1970s
and '80s, the impact on the economy will be negative but maybe
not as negative as we have seen in the past,"" said Elwin de
Groot, market economist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The rise comes against the backdrop of very strong profits
in the past quarters, so we need to see bigger events before the
market is significantly dented by that. Still, there is always a
risk that this will have a bigger impact on the global economy
if things worsen.""

 LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled to regain
its footing on Tuesday, staying near a three-and-a-half month
low against a currency basket on the view that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will stick with loose monetary policy.
 The euro hovered close to its 2011 high of $1.3862 against
the dollar and traders said a catalyst for more gains could come
if U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke continues to
suggest U.S. monetary policy will remain extremely loose.
 Bernanke is expected to stay cautious about the economy at
his semi-annual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee at
1500 GMT, in contrast with other central banks who are focused
on rising inflation.
 The euro was also expected to remain supported ahead of a
European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday, where it may
signal a willingness to raise rates.
 ""Upside in euro/dollar is likely to depend on Bernanke. The
first level is the 2011 high, and once this breaks we could see
a test of $1.40 but for this to happen we would need Trichet to
be quite hawkish on Thursday,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency
strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 The euro was up 0.25 percent at $1.3834, hovering near a
one-month high of $1.3857 hit on trading platform EBS on Monday.
A break of its February high at around $1.3862 would mark its
highest level since early November.
 Traders said the single currency could struggle to extend
gains without a further catalyst, with real money offers
reported around $1.3830-50 ahead of further offers around
$1.3865-70 and barriers at $1.3900, $1.3950 and $1.4000.
 However, buyers were seen around $1.3780-$1.3800 which were
helping to prop up the euro.
 The dollar index, which tracks its performance against a
basket of major currencies, edged down 0.1 percent to 76.793,
close to a 3-½ month low of 76.756 hit on Monday.
 ""If we get any indication that he (Bernanke) is going to
complete the QE2 measures all the way through ... I think it is
quite possible we will see further dollar weakness,"" said Andrew
Robinson, FX market strategist for Saxo Bank in Singapore,
referring to the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying programme.
 Sterling rallied to a 13-month high against the dollar of
$1.6327, supported by market expectations the Bank of England
will raise interest rates before the Fed.

 YEN, SWISS FRANC DIP
 The dollar edged up against the Swiss franc and the yen,
however, as concern about troubles in oil-producing countries in
North Africa and the Middle East eased in the absence of any
significant escalation of tensions while oil prices steadied at
higher levels.
 Uncertainties in the region remained, however, and analysts
said if heightened tensions resume investors could again buy
Swiss franc and yen, the two currencies which have tended to
benefit most when market players have sought safety.
 Versus the yen, the dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.18 yen,
hovering near the middle of its roughly 81 yen to 84 yen range
seen over the past month. Traders cited heavy buying of
dollar/yen by Japanese exporters. The dollar also rose 0.15
versus the Swiss franc to 0.9304 francs.
 Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchange at State Street
Global Markets in Tokyo, said it may be premature to expect
major currencies to start forming strong trends at this point
because many long-term investors are taking a wait-and-see
stance.
 On one hand, global institutional investors are worried that
world economic growth could suffer if unrest in Libya spreads to
Middle East oil producers and causes further surges in oil
prices, Tomita said.
 ""It is hard to choose between one or the other, so there is
no need right now to make a bet, and long-term players are
taking a pause,"" Tomita said.
The Australian dollar was steady at $1.0181 after the
Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75
percent, as expected.

 * Input prices rise fastest rate in survey's 14-year history
 * Survey suggests periphery is also recovering
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The euro zone's manufacturing
sector expanded at its fastest pace in nearly 10 years last
month but worryingly for policymakers, prices rose at their
quickest rate in at least 14 years, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), which records manufacturing activity across all the major
euro area economies, rose to 59.0 in February from 57.3 in
January, in line with an earlier flash estimate and its highest
reading since June 2000.
 In an encouraging sign, growth in the region, which had
previously been mainly driven by Germany's robust economic
recovery, picked up in some economies on the euro zone
periphery.
 The euro zone manufacturing PMI output index rose to 61.4
from the previous month's 59.4, comfortably above the 50 mark
that divides growth from contraction for the 19th month and its
highest level since June 2000.
 But the rapid expansion is coming at a cost, with the input
price index leaping to 85.3 from January's 79.2 -- easily its
highest level since the survey began in June 1997.
 The output price index also hit a record high for the
survey, which was conducted Feb. 11-21 before oil prices spiked
again last week, hitting 2-1/2 year highs on concerns about
supply after uprisings in Libya. Commodity prices have also
soared on growing demand.
 ""Steep increases in raw material prices may deter firms from
recruiting, or drive selling prices even higher in order to
protect margins. The recent uptick in oil prices will only add
to firms' cost pressures,"" said Chris Williamson at data
provider Markit.
 Official data on Monday showed euro zone inflation was 2.3
percent in January, already above the European Central Bank's 2
percent target ceiling. However, the PMI survey suggested
factories still took on workers at a rate not seen since June
2000.
 The ECB has adopted an ultra-loose monetary policy to
support an economy recovering from its worst recession in
decades but economists expect the bank to start raising interest
rates in the fourth quarter to control inflation. [ECB/INT]
 
 REGIONAL REBOUND
 Germany, Europe's largest economy, continued to drive the
upturn with its manufacturing PMI notching up a 15-year survey
high of 62.7, while in neighbouring France factories ramped up
production compared to January.
 Italy and Spain also saw an expansion in their manufacturing
sectors and Markit said the recovery was becoming more
widespread.
 ""Especially encouraging is the indication that growth is
picking up in the region's periphery, led by rising exports,""
Williamson said.
 ""However, domestic demand in austerity focused countries
such as Spain and Ireland remains subdued, and continues to
drive a wedge between the overall rate of economic expansion in
the periphery relative to Germany and France.""

 By Walter Brandimarte and Jonathan Cable
 NEW YORK/LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Factory input costs
rose across the globe in February, the latest sign of brewing
inflation pressures, as manufacturing in the United States and
the euro zone grew at the fastest pace in years.
 The sector accelerated too in India and Britain, where the
expansion was the fastest in nearly two decades. But in China,
where authorities have been trying to cool the economy, factory
growth was the slowest in six months.
 Overall, the February purchasing managers' indexes on
Tuesday provided the latest evidence of growing inflationary
pressure from a sharp rise in commodity prices.
 Crude oil prices hit 2-1/2 year highs last week on supply
concerns after uprisings in Libya.
 ""With the latest surge in commodity prices yet to fully
feed through into consumer prices, inflation could well climb
further in the next few months,"" said Martin van Vliet at ING.
 The spike in oil prices has stoked fears that a sustained
rise in commodity prices, from metals to grains, could weaken
demand and derail the global economic recovery,
 Still, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke argued the
latest surge in oil prices will not have a relevant impact on
the U.S. economy. A sustained price spike, however, could lead
to weaker growth and higher inflation, he warned. For details,
see [ID:nN28285146]
 ""The most likely outcome is that the recent rise in
commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and
relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation,""
Bernanke told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew in February at the
fastest rate since May 2004, and was stronger than
expectations. Prices paid by manufacturers rose, but less than
forecast. [ID:nN01101585]
 In the euro zone, the output price index in the 17-nation
bloc hit a record high for a survey conducted Feb. 11-21,
before oil prices spiked again last week.
 Sustained high oil prices of $110 to $120 a barrel could
damage the global economy, the head of the International
Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, warned on Monday. U.S.
crude prices were just below $100 a barrel on Tuesday.
 INFLATION ABOVE TARGET
 Consumer prices for the euro zone rose 2.4 percent
year-on-year last month, above the European Central Bank's
target of just below 2 percent. The European Commission now
expects inflation for the bloc to finish above the target this
year, at 2.2 percent. [ID:nLDE7200YN]
 The ECB is unlikely to abandon its ultra-loose monetary
policy when it meets on Thursday, but economists anticipate an
interest rate hike by the fourth quarter of this year. The Fed
is also expected to remain on course with its plan to buy
longer-term Treasury securities to boost economic growth.
 Europe's PMIs showed manufacturing growth across the euro
zone, driven mostly by Germany's strong recovery, picked up in
some economies on the periphery. In debt-stricken Ireland,
manufacturing activity hit an 11-year high. [EUR/PMIM]
 In India, factory input prices rose at the fastest pace
since the records for the PMI began in 2005. India's inflation
remains the the highest of any major Asian economy even after
seven rate increases in a year. [ID:nSGE712018]
 ""Manufacturers are facing ever steeper increases in input
costs, reflecting the tightness of labor markets and rising
material costs, which will continue to add upward pressure on
output prices,"" said Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India
and ASEAN at HSBC, which sponsors the index.

 CHINA BRAKES
 China PMIs showed that manufacturing growth slipped to its
slowest pace in at least six months, a sign that the
government's campaign to tame inflation was having an effect.
 But gauges of factory input prices still hit three-month
highs in both China's official PMI and a private-sector PMI
sponsored by HSBC. [ID:nTOE71R08C]
 Many of China's businesses were shut or running at half
speed in the first part of February as China celebrated the
Lunar New Year holiday, making it difficult to draw firm
conclusions, though the PMIs are on a mild downward trend.
 Since October, China has raised banks' required reserve
levels five times to a record high, increased interest rates
three times, and also ordered banks to lend less.

the ""extreme upper limit"" set by regulators, the country's

 By Catherine Bosley and Sven Egenter
 ZURICH, March 1 (Reuters) - The Swiss economy grew at its
fastest pace since late 2007 in the fourth quarter, gaining more
momentum than expected despite the record-high franc and
prompting markets to brace for an early rise in interest rates.
 The economy expanded 0.9 percent in the last three months of
2010 from the previous quarter, thanks to strong company
investment, government consumption and a rise in exports of
goods, official data showed. Economists had expected a slowdown.

 Switzerland has been a destination for investors worried by
unrest in North Africa and the euro zone's debt crisis, driving
the franc to record highs against the dollar and euro that have
prompted complaints from exporters like watchmaker Swatch Group
.
 But forward-looking indicators, such as the KOF economic
barometer, have indicated growth is still robust and the Swiss
National Bank, which had forecast a significant slowdown due to
the rallying franc, has also begun to sound less dour on growth.
 ""The GDP data continue to challenge the SNB's expectation of
a significant slowdown in growth in response to the sharp
appreciation of the exchange rate,"" said BNP Paribas economist
Eoin O'Callaghan.
 ""The longer the economic data defies the SNB's prediction of
a significant slowdown, the more compelling the case for
starting the hiking cycle becomes.""
 In another sign of the upswing continuing, the Swiss
purchasing managers' index beat expectations and jumped to a
seasonally adjusted 63.5 points in February, indicating the
sector was picking up steam.
 The Swiss government had to bail out its largest bank UBS
during the financial crisis but the rest of the financial
sector, worth around 10 percent of GDP, has held up even as
global regulators tightened controls on the sector.
 Swiss hoteliers have complained this year about the rising
franc and there have been calls for the central bank to take
further action to help exporters of both goods and services.
 Sales by major pharmaceuticals firms like Roche and Novartis
have held up well, however, and Swatch also sounded less
worried on Tuesday about the franc's impact as it targeted
record watch sales in 2011.
 
 SNB HIKE COULD COME SOONER
 The SNB, which so far forecast a slowdown of growth to
around 1.5 percent this year from 2.6 percent in 2010 due to the
franc, holds its next quarterly meeting on March 17. More and
more analysts see the economy growing by more than 2 percent.
 The SNB is seen holding rates for now because inflation is
low, but markets have started bracing for an earlier rate hike
than so far anticipated after a string of upbeat news.
 ""I expect another year of strong growth. Despite the strong
franc, that should open the possibility for the SNB to start

which has been at 0.25 percent since March 2009. Until last week
markets were betting on a rate rise in December.
 The Swiss GDP figures were not, however, the strongest in
Europe. Sweden's growth surged 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter
from the third, also trouncing forecasts.
 ""The PMI remaining very buoyant, the Swiss economy seems to
be able to cope with the strong franc better than many have
expected,"" said Citi economist Michael Saunders, adding he
expects growth to clock in near 3 percent this year.
 The franc rose against the euro on the release of the GDP
figures but then weakened again and was trading at 1.2868 per
euro at 1106 GMT, off an intra-day high of 1.2816 per euro.
 Swiss exports of goods rose 2.4 percent in the fourth
quarter from the third, a sign the franc had little effect thus
far. That trend continued in January, when exports also rose,
trade data showed last week.
 The franc's strength did, however, show up in the exports of
services, which fell 5.8 percent, the GDP data showed.
 Some of the decline in service exports was due to tourism,
Acket said. Swiss hoteliers have been complaining the strong
currency has spoiled the winter skiing season.
 Private consumption grew 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter
from the third. Government consumption increased by 1.2 percent
in that period while company investment rose 6.3 percent and
construction was 1.2 percent stronger.
 Gross domestic product increased by 3.1 percent year-on-year
in the fourth quarter, compared with a forecast of 2.8 percent.

 By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, March 1 (Reuters) - Hungary unveiled reforms on
Tuesday to further reduce its budget deficit and cut debt but
lack of detail from the government on how spending will be cut
disappointed investors and hit Hungarian assets.
 The forint has risen since December in anticipation of the
reforms, which investors hoped would address expenditure and put
the budget on a strong footing before ""crisis"" taxes imposed by
the centre-right government expire in 2013.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Tuesday the
government would take measures to improve the budget balance by
900 billion forints by 2013, and drive down public debt to 65-70
percent of GDP by the end of 2014 from around 80 percent now.
 He expected the budget deficit to decline to 2.2 percent of
GDP by 2013, below the European Union's 3 percent ceiling, and
said the planned measures will trim 550 billion forints off the
deficit next year.
 Matolcsy said measures would include a review of disability
pensions and early retirement -- taboo for many years -- as well
as the state drug subsidy system, but would also include keeping
the bank tax fully in place in 2012, contrary to earlier plans.
 ""We cannot offer anything other than a three-year bank tax,
with the full amount in the third year as well, a total of 180
billion forints that banks contribute to the reduction of
Hungary's state debt,"" Matolcsy said.
 It was not clear from Matolcsy's comments if the government
planned to continue to use proceeds from sales of nationalised
pension assets from 2012 onwards to reduce the deficit.
 The forint  eased to 272 to the euro from 270.80 as
lack of detail on spending reforms disappointed markets, and
yields jumped 10 basis points on the long end, traders said.
 Stocks of pharmaceutical firms Egis  and Richter
 plunged on fears they will be hit by an expected cut
in state drug subsidies, while OTP Bank  sold off on
news of the bank tax extension.

 Analysts' initial reaction to the plan was mildly positive,
with their focus mainly on the reduction of Hungary's debt,
although some noted that many details were lacking and that
implementation would carry risks.
 ""The size of the package is positive for investors -- even
if it's partly optical tuning it could sell well to investors,""
said Matyas Kovacs, analyst at Raiffeisen.
 ""Its composition is less favourable as the bank tax will
remain in place in 2012. And that the corporate tax rate will
not be reduced in 2013-2014 could be another negative sign for
investors,"" he added.
""On balance, we can say that the package is lukewarm, which
also seems to be the market's view based on the forint's initial
reaction,"" added Gyorgy Barta at CIB Bank.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government roiled markets last
year by eschewing International Monetary Fund advice in favour
of cash-grabbing measures.
 The government has promised to boost the economy and carry
out long-overdue structural reforms to improve competitiveness.
 
 RATING AGENCIES WATCHING
 Hungary plans total foreign currency issuance of 4 billion
euros this year to finance expiring debt and repay 2 billion
euros of a loan from the EU, and some analysts said the
government could go ahead with a foreign currency bond issue in
the wake of its reform announcements.
 All three major credit rating agencies have said they could
cut Hungary's debt to junk level from just above if the plan is
not credible.
 ""It would be quite important to monitor the ratings agencies
in the next couple of days. Their verdict will be very
important,"" said Elisabeth Gruie, strategist at BNP Paribas.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, March 1 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled
to regain its footing on Tuesday after a steep decline, while
the euro hovered near a one-month high as investors bet the
Federal Reserve will stick to its easing course even as the
European Central Bank talks of tightening.	
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is expected to remain cautious
about the economy at his semi-annual testimony before the Senate
Banking Committee starting at 1500 GMT.	
 In the words of New York Federal Reserve Bank President
William Dudley: ""We're still very far from achieving our dual
mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.""	
 This puts the Fed at odds with other major central banks,
which are starting to worry about rising price pressure, and
reinforces the view that the European Central Bank will probably
hike rates before the Fed.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, edged up 0.1 percent to
76.948, but still remained close to a 3-1/2 month low of 76.756
hit on Monday.	
 Bernanke's testimony could provide the impetus for more
dollar-selling, said Andrew Robinson, FX market strategist for
Saxo Bank in Singapore.	
 ""If we get any indication that he is going to complete the
QE2 measures all the way through...I think it is quite possible
we will see further dollar weakness,"" he said, referring to the
Fed's $600 billion bond-buying programme.	
 If the dollar index drops below trendline support around
76.20 that roughly links its 2008, 2009 and 2010 lows, that
could open the way for a further decline toward its 2010 trough
of 75.631, Robinson added. 
 The euro held steady at $1.3806 , hovering near a
one-month high of $1.3857 hit on trading platform EBS on Monday.
A break of its February high at around $1.3862 could pave the
way for a test of $1.40, traders said.	
 Markets are keeping a close eye on the outcome of the ECB's
policy meeting on Thursday, deemed as one of the most important
of the year given a potent cocktail of new economic forecasts,
crisis support withdrawal and the potential for tough talk on
inflation. 
 Sterling, which has been supported by market expectations
for the Bank of England to raise interest rates before the Fed,
rose to as high as $1.6300 earlier on Tuesday,
matching a peak hit early last November.	
 It later trimmed its gains to stand steady on the day at
$1.6262. A rise to above $1.6300 would take sterling to a
13-month high. 
 
 LONG-TERM INVESTORS SIDELINED	
 However, there are some doubts as to how much further the
dollar may weaken in the near-term. 
 Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchange at State Street
Global Markets in Tokyo, said it may be premature to expect
major currencies to start forming strong trends at this point
because many long-term investors are taking a wait-and-see
stance.	
 On one hand, global institutional investors are worried that
global economic growth could suffer if unrest in Libya spreads
to Middle East oil producers and causes further surges in oil
prices, Tomita said.	
But they also see the possibility that calm could return
relatively quickly, he said.	
""It is hard to choose between one or the other, so there is
no need right now to make a bet, and long-term players are
taking a pause,"" Tomita said.	
Recently, long-term investors have shown demand for equities
in developed economies such as the United States, the euro zone
and Japan as well as Norway, but it is not as if there has been
any strong shift away from emerging markets, he added.	
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.3 percent to $1.0157
, having touched a two-month high of $1.0203 earlier.	
 The Australian dollar fell from around $1.0185 after the
Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75
percent, as expected.	
 The central bank said inflation looked set to remain within
its desired range all year, strongly suggesting the central bank
was in no hurry to raise interest rates. 
 Versus the yen, the dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.18 yen
, hovering right near the middle of its roughly 81 yen to
84 yen range seen over the past month.	
 Data on Japanese margin traders shows that the Japanese
retail investors have been buying the dollar aggressively
recently as the U.S. currency retreated from a peak near 84.00
yen hit in mid-February.	
 The Japanese margin traders' net long position in the dollar
against the yen swelled to record $2.94 billion as of last
Friday, up from $1.73 billion a week earlier.

 SYDNEY, March 1 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept
interest rates steady on Tuesday for a fourth month and said
inflation looked set to remain within its desired range all
year, strongly suggesting it was in no hurry to hike again.	
 The Australian dollar slipped after the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) ended its March policy meeting by leaving its
cash rate at 4.75 percent, as widely expected.	
 It noted strength in mining investment and the terms of
trade, but also caution among consumers and high savings.	
 ""At today's meeting, the board judged that the current
mildly restrictive stance of monetary policy remained
appropriate in view of the general macroeconomic outlook,"" RBA
Governor Glenn Stevens wrote in a brief statement.	
 That seemed to be a little less hawkish than some expected
and the Australian dollar eased to $1.0165 , having
earlier hit a two-month peak of $1.02030.	
 Interbank futures <0#YIB:> still show little chance of a
further hike until late in the year, with a move in August a
50-50 bet.	


 ""It's clear the RBA sees no pressing need to tighten again,""
said Brian Redican, senior economist at Macquarie. ""They just
sound extraordinarily relaxed about inflation and policy right
now. So, no move for the next couple of months at least.""	
 The central bank led the developed world by hiking 175 basis
points since late 2009, a pre-emptive policy that has worked
well to tame inflation and curb consumer demand.	
 Indeed, Stevens predicted that a recent weather-driven spike
in food prices would be short lived.	
 ""The bank expects that inflation over the year ahead will
continue to be consistent with the 2-3 percent target,"" he
concluded. 
 Underlying inflation slowed to a decade-low around 2.25
percent last quarter and there are signs it could subside
further this quarter, perhaps lessening pressure for a hike in
the next few months.	
 
 CONSUMERS VS MINERS	
 Consumers have helped by spending less and saving the most
in almost two decades, forcing retailers to discount more
heavily.	
 Figures on Tuesday showed retail sales rose a moderate 0.4
percent in January, but mainly due to the biggest jump in food
sales in 12 years as flooding across Queensland led people to
stock up on essentials.	
 Annual sales were up 1.8 percent, a miserly result given
unemployment is at 5 percent and wages are growing healthily.	
 ""The consumer caution that's weighing on growth, and is
central to the RBA decision, is intact in the early part of
2011,"" said Commonwealth Bank chief economist Michael Blythe.	
 ""But the economy had a fair degree of momentum at the end of
2010, which is what we need to bump through whatever pothole
might emerge due to the floods,"" said Blythe. ""The RBA won't
move today but the story is in place for higher rates.""	
 Figures on gross domestic product (GDP) are due on Wednesday
and analysts have been looking for a rise of 0.6 percent in the
fourth quarter and 2.7 percent for the year.	
 The RBA itself expects the economy to expand at a rapid 4.25
percent pace for all of 2011, and grow around 4 percent for at
least the next two years.	
 Much of that optimism reflects rapacious demand from China
and India for Australia's resource riches, which has fuelled a
huge rise in export earnings. 
 Australia's surplus on goods and services widened to a
record A$6.80 billion ($6.86 billion) last quarter, a radical
turnaround from a few years ago when deficits of $6 billion were
routine.	
 And policymakers reckon it will last a long while yet.	
 The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resources
Economics and Sciences (ABARES) on Tuesday predicted earnings
from resources would rise 29 percent in the year to June 2011,
and a further 14 percent the following year to reach a quarter
of a trillion dollars.	
 The agency also believes earnings would keep climbing until
at least 2015/16, when they would reach A$290 billion.

 Seeking to make the most of sky-high prices, miners have
embarked on a record-breaking investment spree. Spending is set
to rise 58 percent in the year to June, and then a further 38
percent in 2011/12 to hit A$76 billion, or 5.8 percent of
Australia's A$1.3 trillion in GDP.	
 This spending boom is a major reason many economists suspect
the RBA will have to move again by mid-year .

 By Daniel Magnowski	
 SINGAPORE, March 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Tuesday,
tracking U.S. shares which gained on optimistic remarks from
influential investor Warren Buffett, while Chinese manufacturing
growth slowed to a six-month low.	
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average climbed 1 percent
and the broader Topix index rose 1.2 percent, while
Australian shares also gained.	
 Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc , told
shareholders in his widely read annual letter that he saw the
need for ""major acquisitions"", a sign stocks may be cheap.

 In many parts of Asia, inflation and measures to combat it
continue to dominate policymaking. Inflation is seen as one of
greatest risks to the economic growth that has encouraged
investment in Asian emerging markets, as much of Europe and
other developed economies stagnate.	
 Chinese manufacturing growth slowed in February, according
to an official survey, as the government's sustained campaign to
tame inflation weighed on industrial activity.	
 High global commodity prices complicated the task of
monetary tightening, pushing a gauge of industrial input prices
to a three-month high in China's official purchasing managers'
index (PMI). 
 The overall PMI, which is designed to provide a snapshot of
conditions in the manufacturing sector, fell to 52.2 in February
from 52.9 in January, the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said. 
 ""Inflation pressures are rising but economic activity is
slowing. Slower economic growth is good for cooling inflation,""
said Wang Hu, economist at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.	
 
 China's battle with inflation is a key market factor, and
some foreign investors may favour Japanese stocks, analysts
said.	
 ""U.S. and European investors have been the main players in
the Japanese market. But Asian investors have joined in as Japan
is one of the few countries with a low risk of rate hikes,"" said
Shun Maruyama, chief strategist at Credit Suisse.	
 ""They are buying Japanese stocks on a process of elimination
as Japan has more tolerance for higher oil prices than other
Asian countries.""	
 Australia's central bank kept interest rates steady on
Tuesday for a fourth month, and said inflation looked set to
remain within its preferred range all year, indicating it would
not rush to raise them again.	
 In Indonesia, annual inflation slowed in February but at
6.84 percent stayed above the central bank's target range of 4-6
percent. 
 Crude oil traded close to $120 per barrel last week, its
highest in more than two years, largely on fears that political
upheaval in Libya would spread across oil-producing nations in
the Middle East, but Saudi Arabia calmed the market with extra
supply.	
 Brent crude was steady around $112 per barrel, while
U.S. crude for delivery in April rose 45 cents to $97.41
per barrel. Gold , which in February recorded its biggest
monthly gain since August as worried investors sought safety,
was up around $3 to $1,413.60 per ounce.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was steady at 76.951, not
far from a 3-1/2 month low of 76.756.	
 The British pound hit its highest in four months
versus the dollar, on expectations the Bank of England would
raise rates, and that high oil prices would retard U.S. economic
growth.	
 Investors are awaiting some key U.S. economic events. This
week will see Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony at the
Senate Banking Committee at 1500 GMT on Tuesday and U.S. jobs
data on Friday.

 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Latin American currencies
were trapped in narrow ranges on Monday as investors remained
cautious about the impact of higher oil prices on global growth
and the region's importers, such as Chile.
 Concerns that a spike in oil prices could hurt global
growth have weighed on the region's currencies in recent weeks,
softening a trend of steady appreciation as investors are drawn
to Latin America's relatively high interest rates.
 Brent crude oil prices rose above $112 a barrel, but the
market calmed from last week's jumps as investors weighed a
pledge of more supply from Saudi Arabia against the prospect of
prolonged disruption to Libya's output.
 The currencies of oil producers Mexico and Brazil managed
to firm while the peso of Chile, an importer of crude, dipped.
 ""Mexico's peso has been strengthening since the peak of oil
prices last week, so this is just unwinding these extreme
scenarios on Middle East oil risk,"" said Igor Arsenin, head of
Latin American fixed-income strategy at Credit Suisse in New
York.
 ""If we have a permanent increase in oil just because of
lingering uncertainty in the Middle East, then it becomes
actually favorable for oil exporters such as Mexico and less
favorable for importers, countries like Chile,"" he added.
 Mexico's peso  firmed 0.19 percent to 12.1025 per
dollar. Brazil's real  bid 0.06 percent stronger on the
local spot market to 1.661 per dollar.
 Brazil's central bank knocked the currency back from a
nearly two-month high hit early in the session by intervening
with two auctions to buy dollars in the spot market, a reverse
currency swap auction and two dollar forward auctions.
 Chile's peso  slipped 0.25 percent to 475.70 per
dollar.
 ""Oil prices are more stable ... but the price is still near
$112, which is very high for a country like ours that imports
almost all of its petroleum,"" a Chilean trader said.
 Investors pushed down yields on Brazilian interest rate
futures <0#DIJ:> on bets that government spending cuts may cool
the need for an aggressive interest rate hike this week.
 Brazil's government said on Monday it will slash spending
on defense and low-income housing as part of $30 billion in
cuts to this year's budget. [ID:nN28242976]
 Brazilian central bank policymakers meet on Wednesday to
decide on a possible hike in the country's interest rate.
 While some market players were betting last week that they
could raise rates by 75 basis points, the market began late
last week to unwind those bets.
 Yields on Mexican interest rate swaps edged up after the
head of the country's central bank expressed worry about crop
failures from bad weather and said policymakers may have to
raise interest rates if they poison inflation expectations.
[ID:nN28245067]
 Mexico, whose economic recovery has been slower than that
of Brazil or Chile, has widely been expected not to raise
interest rates until early in 2012.
 ""Mexico has been spared a significant pick-up in food
inflation, but that could change purely because of local
conditions,"" Credit Suisse's Arsenin said.

 TORONTO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar jumped to its
highest level against the U.S. dollar since November 2007 on
Monday after fourth-quarter GDP data topped expectations and
backed predictions that the Bank of Canada will resume interest
rate hikes in the first half of the year.
 Annualized GDP growth in the quarter was 3.3 percent,
boosted by surging exports and strong consumer spending,
Statistics Canada said.
 Statscan also revised third-quarter GDP growth to 1.8
percent from 1.0 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had
expected annualized growth of 3.0 percent in the fourth
quarter. [ID:nSCLSDE79U]
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney had conceded earlier
this month that the bank's January forecast of 2.3 percent
growth in the fourth quarter was likely short of the mark,
suggesting the export strength was a surprise.
 ""It's certainly above market expectations, but more
importantly above the BoC's expectations,"" said Jonathan
Basile, economist at Credit Suisse in New York.
 The currency  rose as high as C$0.9710 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0299, its firmest level since November 2007.
 It finished mildly off the session high at C$0.9714 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.0294, up three-quarters of a cent from
Friday's North American finish of C$0.9787 to the U.S. dollar,
or $1.0218.
 Few technical barriers stood in the currency's path as it
surged to the highest levels reached before the global
financial crisis. [ID:nN17237763]
 A second economic report also offered support to the
currency, with higher exports helping narrow Canada's current
fourth-quarter account deficit. [ID:nN28244157]
[ID:nN28244249]
 EYES ON THE BOC
 The GDP figures come one day ahead of a scheduled Bank of
Canada policy announcement, but analysts see little chance of
the central bank raising interest rates on Tuesday morning.
 Short-dated government bonds fell steeply, responding to
evidence of momentum in Canada's economic recovery, which could
increase the chances of interest rate hikes later this year.
The interest rate-sensitive two-year bond  dropped 12
Canadian cents to yield 1.842 percent.
 ""Expectations for Bank of Canada tightening has moved
forward because of the strong GDP report, but it's not going to
affect (the rate decision) tomorrow,"" said Sheldon Dong, fixed
income analyst at TD Waterhouse Private Investment.
 Dong said the overnight index swaps market suggests the May
31 policy-setting date is the most likely time that the Bank of
Canada will take its key rate up 25 basis points from the
current 1 percent, which matches a Reuters poll from Feb. 24.
 Market watchers now expect stronger language on the
economic outlook in the Bank of Canada's commentary on
Tuesday's rate decision, which may lay the groundwork for an
interest rate increase in either April or May. [ID:nN24280596]
 ""I think we will hear a more two-handed statement from the
Bank of Canada tomorrow, which could set the stage for a rate
hike in coming months,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at
BMO Capital Markets.
 ""(The GDP data) is moving in the right direction,
consistent with an economy that's picking up steam.""
 But not all market watchers were convinced that the Bank of
Canada would move quickly on rates, particularly as the
Canadian dollar is now much higher than the parity level the
central bank had assumed in its last Monetary Policy Report in
January.
 ""I think it's a good report, stands up to scrutiny, but it
still, in my mind, doesn't change anything for the Bank of
Canada,"" said Derek Holt, economist at Scotia Capital.
 ""I think they're likely to say that we've seen a bit of
growth momentum of late, but we're more concerned about the
developments in global commodities, downside risks to global
growth, compared to the last statement.""

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets rose on
Monday on encouraging economic data and after optimistic
comments from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, while the
dollar hit a 3-1/2-month low against a basket of major
currencies.
 World equities, measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, added 0.8 percent, after rising 1.1
percent on Friday. The global index is up 2.4 percent this
month, on track for a third straight monthly rise.
 The dollar slid against a currency basket ahead of U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony before
congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 Brent crude oil futures edged lower for the day as more
production from Saudi Arabia helped offset supply disruptions
due to turmoil in Libya.
 For the month, though, Brent crude oil prices surged 10.68
percent -- the biggest percentage gain since May 2009, when
prices soared 29 percent. It touched a 29-month high near $120
a barrel last week.
 On Wall Street, investors' mood got a lift from some
upbeat economic data and a positive outlook from Buffett.
 An index of U.S. Midwest business activity rose
unexpectedly in February, according to the Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago, while U.S. personal income shot up
1 percent in January, Commerce Department data showed.
 Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc , told
shareholders in his widely read annual letter that he sees the
need for ""major acquisitions,"" a sign stocks may be cheap.
Berkshire's Class B  shares rose 2.8 percent to
$87.28. [ID:nN26170376] [ID:nN27180671]
 Ventas Inc  said it will buy Nationwide Health
Properties  for $5.8 billion in a stock deal that
strengthens its position as the biggest U.S. owner of senior
housing. NHP shares jumped 9.7 percent to $42.74.
 ""We expect M&A activities to dramatically accelerate this
year,"" said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A.
Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon.
 S&P 500 UP 3.2 PCT FOR MONTH
 James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve,
also gave stock investors reasons to be optimistic with his
comments that the U.S. economy should do well in 2011 and oil
prices are not currently a drag on the recovery.
 U.S. stocks racked up a third month of gains. The
benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> rose 3.2 percent for
the month, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average
gained 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq added 3 percent.
 The market has defied expectations for a major correction,
despite rallying since September. The S&P 500 is up 26 percent
since the start of September.
 The dollar, however, came under pressure on expectations
that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in testimony to congressional
committees later this week, will stick with his recent
economic assessment that the recovery is strengthening, but
not enough to bring about a significant improvement in the
jobs market.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 95.89
points, or 0.79 percent, to end at 12,226.34. The S&P 500
advanced 7.34 points, or 0.56 percent, to finish at 1,327.22.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 1.22 points, or 0.04
percent, to close at 2,782.27.
 Limiting the Nasdaq's advance was a downgrade by UBS of
online retailer Amazon Inc  to ""neutral"" from ""buy,""
due to higher costs. Amazon was down 2.2 percent at $173.36.
 VOLATILE OIL AND GOLD ABOVE $1,400
 Brent crude oil prices were volatile, following a spike
last week on worries over supply disruption from the Middle
East and North Africa. Brent crude  slipped 34 cents to
settle at $111.80 a barrel.
 The uprising in Libya has cut as much as three-quarters of
the country's oil output, prompting Saudi Arabia to step in
and plug the supply gap to Libya's oil buyers.
 The gains raised worries about its effect on the global
economic recovery.
 ""If oil prices rise further, it will restrain economic
growth. But with no further escalations, at current levels it
isn't going to cause a recession,"" said Jason Pride, director
of investment strategy at Glenmede Investment and Wealth
Management in Philadelphia.
 Spot gold  stayed above $1,400 an ounce, reflecting
investors' safe-haven bid due to turmoil in the Middle East
and North Africa.
 DOLLAR SLIPS BEFORE BERNANKE SPEAKS
 The U.S. dollar fell versus a currency basket as investors
speculated that this week Fed chief Bernanke will signal
continued support for the central bank's quantitative easing
program.
 Bernanke is scheduled to testify before key congressional
committees on Tuesday and Wednesday. Expectations are that he
will reiterate his view of an economic recovery that is still
not strong enough to significantly reduce the jobless rate,
suggesting the time is not ripe for U.S. interest rates to
rise.
 The ICE futures exchange's U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which
tracks the greenback's performance against a basket of major
currencies, was down 0.5 percent. Earlier, the index hit its
lowest level since Nov. 9.
 U.S. Treasury prices were mixed, with Federal Reserve
purchases and subdued consumer spending in January seen as
supportive.
 Commerce Department data showed U.S. consumer spending was
weaker than expected, down 0.1 percent in January, the first
decline in a year.
 The yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 stood at 3.42 percent, unchanged from late last
week.
 ""Look for (investors) to have 'one foot' in the Treasury
market, and 'one foot' in something offering a higher return,
as investors go back and forth, depending how the wind blows
on some key global issues,"" said Kevin Giddis, president of
fixed income capital markets at Morgan Keegan in Memphis,
Tennessee.
 According to fund tracker EPFR Global, a growing aversion
to risky assets in the latest week fueled the biggest flows to
global bond funds in more than three months, and turned more
investors away from emerging market stocks. [ID:nN25262438]
 The rotation out of emerging markets into developed
markets, partly driven by inflation concerns in emerging
economies, has led to outperformance in developed markets. The
MSCI emerging market index <.MSCIEF> has lost 4.2 percent this
year.
 Credit Suisse's private bank expected the fund rotation to
ease in the second quarter.
 In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index
<.FTEU3> of top shares closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,169.24
points.

 (Updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped to a
3-1/2-month low against major currencies on Monday and may
extend losses on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke will continue to support stimulative policy.
 The euro hit a near one-month high above $1.3850 ahead of
an interest-rate meeting by the European Central Bank on
Thursday. The euro could make a run toward $1.40, traders said,
should the ECB maintain a hawkish tone on inflation. 
 Bernanke testifies to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Analysts expect him to stick to his recent economic assessment
that the recovery is strengthening but not enough to bring
about a significant improvement in the jobs market, suggesting
the time is not ripe for U.S. rates to rise.
 ""The dollar is remaining on its back foot because other
central banks are turning more hawkish but the Fed is not,""
said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currency strategist at UBS in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""We don't think (Bernanke) will change his outlook for the
economy. He will emphasize that the Fed has the tool to exit
quantitative easing but is not going to do so yet,"" she added.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, declined to
76.756, its lowest level since Nov. 9.
 Traders said the move below the February trough of 76.881
triggered fresh-selling by ""model"" accounts, which are based on
computer-generated trading recommendations.
 The euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.3802, after earlier
rising as high as $1.3857 on trading platform EBS, its
strongest since the start of the month. Technical analysts said
a break of the euro's February high at $1.3862, also the
highest since early November, was needed for added momentum.
 The euro has gained 0.8 percent versus the dollar in
February and is up about 3 percent so far this year after
recent inflation-fighting rhetoric from ECB officials boosted
expectations euro zone interest rates will rise faster than
those in the United States.
 Annual euro zone inflation hit a more than two-year high of
2.3 percent in January, the second month in a row that it has
been above the ECB's target. Inflation will likely rise further
in February due mainly to more expensive oil. Against the
yen, the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 81.79, but was down about
0.4 percent this month.
 HIGHER OIL
 Soaring oil prices also weighed on the dollar in recent
sessions as investors fret the U.S. economy is more vulnerable
to higher energy costs, given its strong reliance on consumer
spending for growth.
 Brent crude oil futures earlier rose more than $2 per
barrel as protests in Oman fueled wider concern about security
of supply from the Middle East after uprisings in Libya
dramatically reduced exports from North Africa. ""The ECB
sees rising crude as an upside risk to inflation rather than
the Fed's view that it will be negative for growth. This is
increasing the risks of a near-term overshoot for the euro,""
said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ in London.
 However, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard
said on Monday that rising oil prices are not currently a drag
on the recovery. He repeated comments he made last week that he
would like to dial back the Fed's $600 billion bond buying
program. Bullard is not a voting member. See Some
analysts said the euro is vulnerable to profit-taking. Data
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
speculators boosted bets in favor of the euro to the highest
since October in the week ended Feb. 22.
 Euro and Canadian dollar long positions in U.S. dollar
terms accounted for $14.7 billion, around two-thirds, of the
total $22.4 billion U.S. dollar short position.
 Expectations for strong U.S. jobs data for February, due
out Friday, could also limit the euro's upside. The
dollar was little changed at 0.9290 Swiss franc, not far from a
record low of 0.9229 hit on EBS last week. The dollar lost
about 1.6 percent this month against the franc as tensions in
the Middle East and Africa boosted safe-haven demand for the
Swiss currency.

 * Doubts usefulness of new competitiveness measures
 
 (Adds quotes, details, background)
 By Andreas Rinke
 HAMBURG, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt told Reuters on Monday that the European Union should
avoid separate summits for members of the single currency zone
such as a March 11 meeting to discuss euro zone crisis measures.
 His comments clashed with a joint proposal by Berlin and
Paris earlier this month for euro zone leaders to hold annual
meetings to review steps to improve economic cooperation.
 Reinfeldt said in an interview in Hamburg that his country
was not a member of the euro zone but was reform-minded and had
performed well through the euro crisis.
 ""We should not have that kind of division inside the
European Union for the future,"" he said, adding that the
currency bloc could already meet on its own at ministerial level
as the Eurogroup.
 ""I think we should not divide the European Union, but stick
at the 27 members being present when it comes to heads of state
and government,"" said the conservative Swedish leader.
 European Union leaders will meet in three separate summit
formats in March -- leaders of 14 centre-right EU states gather
in Helsinki on March 4, the 17 members of the euro zone have
their own summit on March 11 and finally there is a summit of
the full membership's leaders on March 24-25.
 These summits are expected to discuss a comprehensive euro
zone crisis response including a competitiveness pact, with
public spending reforms, pushed by Germany and France.
 But Reinfeldt said he was sceptical about the need for such
a competitiveness package, saying Europe already had plenty of
pacts which it does not comply with, citing as examples the
Stability and Growth Pact and the ""2020 Agenda"".
 ""Just by following through on what we have already decided I
think we would create a lot more competitiveness. Until I see
what is the exact content, I am not sure the solution should be
the creation of new institutions or new facilities until we do
not follow the ones we already have,"" he said.
 Reinfeldt reiterated his view that there is no chance at
present of Sweden wanting to join the euro, saying ""the issue is
not open for the moment"". Sweden voted against euro membership
in a referendum in 2003, under a centre-left government.
 Sweden's economy has bounced back from a 2009 recession, its
worst since World War Two, and the crown recently hit 10-year
highs against the euro . It strengthened a bit more
against the euro after the central bank released minutes that
set a hawkish tone for Swedish interest rates. [ID:nLDE71R0NH]
 Reinfeldt expressed doubts about how helpful it would be for
Europe to offer further aid to struggling Greece and Ireland,
citing Sweden's experience of its own crisis in the early 1990s.
 ""It took us eight years to come back, eight years of very
tough reform,"" he said, adding that while he was sure Greece and
other countries had ""done a lot"" to put their houses in order,
emergency loans were a stop-gap measure ""but not a solution"".

speculated that this week Fed chief Bernanke will signal
continued support for the central bank's quantitative easing
program.
 Bernanke is scheduled to testify before key congressional
committees on Tuesday and Wednesday. Expectations are that he
will reiterate his view of an economic recovery that is still
not strong enough to significantly reduce the jobless rate,
suggesting the time is not ripe for U.S. interest rates to
rise.
 The ICE futures exchange's U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which
tracks the greenback's performance against a basket of major
currencies, was down 0.4 percent. Earlier, the indexr hit its
lowest level since Nov. 9.
 U.S. Treasuries prices were mixed, with Federal Reserve
purchases and subdued consumer spending in January seen as
supportive.
 Commerce Department data showed U.S. consumer spending was
weaker than expected, down 0.1 percent in January, the first
decline in a year.
 The yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 stood at 3.42 percent, unchanged from late last
week.
 ""Look for (investors) to have 'one foot' in the Treasury
market, and 'one foot' in something offering a higher return,
as investors go back and forth, depending how the wind blows on
some key global issues,"" said Kevin Giddis, president of fixed
income capital markets at Morgan Keegan in Memphis, Tennessee.
 According to fund tracker EPFR Global, a growing aversion
to risky assets in the latest week fueled the biggest flows to
global bond funds in more than three months, and turned more
investors away from emerging market stocks. [ID:nN25262438]
 The rotation out of emerging markets into developed
markets, partly driven by inflation concerns in emerging
economies, has led to outperformance in developed markets. The
MSCI emerging market index <.MSCIEF> has lost 4.2 percent this
year.
 Credit Suisse's private bank expected the fund rotation to
ease in the second quarter.
 In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
of top shares closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,169.24 points.
 Copper prices also rose, helped by a weaker U.S. dollar and
U.S. economic data, including the Midwest business activity
report.

 * Canada says hopes sanctions will be short-lived
(Adds comment from Suncor)
 OTTAWA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The sanctions that Canada has
imposed on Libya do not affect the commercial operations of
firms such as engineering company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc
, government House Leader John Baird said on Monday.
 Baird also said Ottawa had blocked unspecified financial
dealings the Libyan government had planned to carry out in
Canada. He declined to give further details.
 Canada announced late on Sunday it would ""impose an asset
freeze on, and a prohibition of financial transactions with the
government of Libya, its institutions and agencies, including
the Libyan Central Bank"".
 SNC-Lavalin and oil company Suncor Energy Inc  both
have operations in Libya. Baird said the sanctions would not
stop the companies from doing business there.
 ""This doesn't eliminate commercial activities,"" he told
reporters.
 ""We are hoping that the hard line taken by the
international community, and the even harder line taken by our
government against the current Libyan regime will bring about
change quickly, and the negative impact of these sanctions will
be limited and will be very short term,"" he said.
 Suncor, Canada's biggest oil company, said last week that
it had evacuated all its expatriate staff in Libya and that
field operations were shut down. The company produced nearly
35,000 barrels of oil a day in Libya in the fourth quarter.
 The company said on Monday it won't comment on the
sanctions until it's clear on what the measures entail.
 ""Until we understand the details of the sanctions, planned
or imposed by Canadian and other governments, there is little
we can say,"" Michael Lawrence, a spokesman for Suncor, said in
an email.
 A spokeswoman for SNC-Lavalin -- whose Libyan projects
include a prison, a water pipeline and an airport -- said the
company was waiting for more details on the sanctions before
commenting.
 Asked what restrictions Canadian companies would face,
Baird said: ""They can operate there, they can operate
commercially. What they can't do is operate financially with
either the Libyan government or the central bank of Libya.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a
3-1/2-month low against major currencies on Monday and could
extend losses on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke will continue to support stimulative policy.
 The euro hit a near one-month high above $1.3850 ahead of
an interest-rate meeting by the European Central Bank on
Thursday. The euro could make a run toward $1.40, traders said,
should the ECB maintain a hawkish tone on inflation.
 Bernanke testifies to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Analysts expect him to stick to his recent economic assessment
that the recovery is strengthening but not enough to bring
about a significant improvement in the jobs market, suggesting
the time is not ripe for U.S. rates to rise.
 ""The dollar is remaining on its back foot because other
central banks are turning more hawkish but the Fed is not,""
said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currency strategist at UBS in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""We don't think (Bernanke) will change his outlook for the
economy. He will emphasize that the Fed has the tool to exit
quantitative easing but is not going to do so yet,"" she added.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, declined to
76.756, its lowest level since Nov. 9.
 Traders said the move below the February trough of 76.881
had triggered fresh-selling by ""model"" accounts, which are
based on computer-generated trading recommendations.
 The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.3817, after earlier
rising as high as $1.3857 on trading platform EBS, its
strongest since the start of the month. Technical analysts said
a break of the euro's year-to-date high at $1.3862 was needed
for added momentum.
 The euro has gained 0.8 percent versus the dollar in
February and is up about 3 percent so far this year after
recent inflation-fighting rhetoric from ECB officials boosted
expectations euro zone interest rates will rise faster than
those in the United States.
 Annual euro zone inflation hit a more than two-year high of
2.3 percent in January, the second month in a row that it has
been above the ECB's target. Inflation will likely rise further
in February due mainly to more expensive oil.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 81.95, but
was down about 0.2 percent this month.
 HIGHER OIL
 Soaring oil prices also weighed on the dollar in recent
sessions as investors fret the U.S. economy is more vulnerable
to higher energy costs, given its strong reliance on consumer
spending for growth.
 Brent crude oil futures earlier rose more than $2 per
barrel as protests in Oman fueled wider concern about security
of supply from the Middle East after uprisings in Libya
dramatically reduced exports from North Africa.
 ""The ECB sees rising crude as an upside risk to inflation
rather than the Fed's view that it will be negative for growth.
This is increasing the risks of a near-term overshoot for the
euro,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ in
London.
 However, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard
said on Monday that rising oil prices are not currently a drag
on the recovery. He repeated comments he made last week that he
would like to dial back the Fed's $600 billion bond buying
program. Bullard is not a voting member. See
 Some analysts said the euro is vulnerable to profit-taking.
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
speculators boosted bets in favor of the euro to the highest
since October in the week ended Feb. 22.
 Expectations for strong U.S. jobs data for February, due
out Friday, could also limit the euro's upside.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 0.9298 Swiss franc, not far
from a record low of 0.9229 hit on EBS last week. The dollar
lost about 1.5 percent this month against the franc as tensions
in the Middle East and Africa boosted safe-haven demand for the
Swiss currency.

 * Stock market reopening will be test of confidence
 * C.bank said taking discreet step to stem foreign transfers
 
 By Patrick Werr
 CAIRO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Egypt's new government has little
time to get a credible political process in place before it
risks renewed and possibly unsustainable pressure on its
currency.
 The revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak shattered
two of the main pillars supporting the Egyptian pound, tourism
and foreign investment, and put pressure on others, such as
remittances from Egyptians working abroad.
 These sources of economic growth will not revive unless
Egyptians and foreigners are convinced life is heading back to
normal. If they aren't, Egypt risks quickly depleting its $35
billion in foreign reserves.
 ""Short term I'm bearish. Foreign exchange inflows are now
gone,"" said Raza Agha, a Royal Bank of Scotland economist.
 ""Over the medium and long term, resolution of the political
situation is key, because only that will ensure that the
tourists and the FDI (foreign direct investment) returns and
exports are not impacted by any strikes or public unrest.""
 Egypt's military rulers have promised constitutional changes
leading to free and fair elections within six months. A judicial
committee tasked with drafting the changes proposed amendments
on Saturday that will be voted on in a public referendum. 
 Such a referendum may be just weeks away, giving the
government scant time to build up its confidence, and investors
will be watching to see if the constitutional process is enough
to satisfy pro-democracy protesters still active on the streets.
 On Saturday, soldiers used force to break up a protest
demanding more political reform in Egypt in the toughest move
yet against opposition activists who accused the country's
military rulers of ""betraying the people"".
 
 FEELING THE PINCH
 The most immediate test of the currency and an important
symbol that politics and the economy are returning to normal
will be the opening on Tuesday of Egypt's stock market after a
month-long closure.
 Investors are bracing for a possible plunge in share prices
and a further outflow of funds from the pound, if sellers of
stocks seek to exchange the proceeds for foreign currency.
 ""The key is to watch what happens in the aftermath of the
stock market opening,"" Khan said. ""You may see some depreciation
pressure on the pound as foreigners try to liquidate their
positions.""
 Bankers say that until now the central bank has deftly
handled the foreign currency crisis, holding the pound's losses
to 1.2 percent of its value since protests erupted on Jan. 25.
The pound is currently trading at 5.89 pounds per dollar
 Still, there are signs the country's finances and currency
are feeling the pinch and that at least some banks are running
short of dollars.
 Even though banks were open for only two days in January
after anti-government protests started, Egypt's foreign reserves
fell by about $1 billion in January, their first decline in over
a year and the biggest since April 2009 in the wake of the
global economic crisis. Banks have reopened since then.

 CURRENCY OUTFLOWS
 In the last two weeks, the central bank has quietly sought
to slow transfers out of pounds with a series of unwritten
instructions to banks that stop short of out-and-out capital
controls, bankers inside and outside of Egypt said.
 The central bank has placed inspectors inside the dealing
rooms of at least some of the country's banks, where they are
investigating where people seeking to transfer funds got their
money and where they're sending it, bankers said.
 Clients asking to transfer more than $100,000 must wait five
days until settlement instead of the normal two. Banks are also
required to double-check transfers as small as $10,000.
 The stated reason for this is to make sure the funds were
not obtained illegally, but at the same time it is helping the
government to slow the outflow of funds, bankers said.
 Banks have sought to discourage clients who want to shift
their funds into dollars or have out-and-out refused, several
people who have tried to buy dollars said.
 This has been confirmed by bankers: ""We are telling our
clients there is a shortage of dollars and we can't do it,"" one
banker said.
 Foreign currency transactions on Egypt's interbank market
have averaged about $300 million a day over the last week, an
amount bankers say is surprisingly small considering the size of
the economy and the political turbulence of the last month.
 Asked by local journalists about the cost of the unrest,
newly-appointed Finance Minister Samir Radwan quoted a Feb. 4
note by Credit Agricole estimating it at $310 million a day -- a
reminder of Egypt's urgent need to revive traditional sources of
national income after weeks of political turmoil.

 NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Major stock markets rose on
Monday as worries eased about the effect of high energy prices
on U.S. economic growth, while the dollar hit a 3-1/2-month low
against a basket of major currencies.
 World equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> added 0.9 percent, after rising 1.1 percent on
Friday. The global index is up 2.3 percent this month, on track
for a third straight monthly rise.
 Comments by James Bullard, president of the St. Louis
Federal Reserve, that the U.S. economy should do well in 2011
and that oil prices are not currently a drag on the recovery
helped boost U.S. stocks.
 ""If oil prices rise further it will restrain economic
growth, but with no further escalations, at current levels it
isn't going to cause a recession,"" said Jason Pride, director
of investment strategy at Glenmede Investment and Wealth
Management in Philadelphia.
 The dollar, however, came under pressure on expectations
that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in testimony to Congress later
this week, will stick with his recent economic assessment that
the recovery is strengthening, but not enough to bring about a
significant improvement in the jobs market.

points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,795.10.
 U.S. stocks last week had their worst performance since
November on worries about energy prices and the revolt in
Libya.
 Brent crude oil prices were volatile, following a spike
last week on worries over supply disruption from the Middle
East and North Africa. Brent crude  was last up 0.2
percent at $112.41.
 The uprising in Libya has cut as much as three quarters of
the country's oil output, prompting Saudi Arabia to step in and
plug the supply gap to Libya's oil buyers.
 Brent crude is up more than 10 percent this month, heading
toward its sixth straight month of rises. It touched a 29-month
high of near $120 a barrel last week.

 U.S. Treasuries prices remained steady at slightly higher
levels after an index of Midwest business activity came in
stronger than expected in February.
 Benchmark 10-year note  yields stood at 3.42

 U.S. Treasuries earlier were supported by comments by the

 * Merkel's strategy fraught with risk
 * Chancellor needs conservative star for elections
 
 By Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's need
for conservative support ahead of three state elections and euro
zone crisis summits are forcing her to stand by her government's
fallen idol in a plagiarism row despite risks to her own image.
 Fearful of a backlash from centre-right German voters in
March if she were to dismiss Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu
Guttenberg over transgressions in his doctoral dissertation,
Merkel has opted to back the aristocrat from Bavaria -- for now.
 Guttenberg was stripped of his doctorate after admitting
last week his PhD dissertation was flawed. He apologised to
parliament after being accused of copying parts of the
dissertation without correct attribution.
 Guttenberg has rejected charges of plagiarism and opposition
calls to resign over the affair, which has dominated headlines
and television chat shows for the last week. His popularity has
waned but he remains the darling of conservative voters.
 For the time being, Merkel has opted to back Guttenberg --
because she needs the only bright spot in her cabinet ahead of
state elections in March. To dismiss Guttenberg could anger
conservative voters, especially in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
 ""Merkel needs him because he's still popular and his image
appeals to many conservative voters who aren't particularly
bothered about how he got his academic credentials,"" said Gero
Neugebauer, political scientist at Berlin's Free University.
 ""She doesn't want to aggravate conservative voters. She's
counting on it all blowing over. But it's not and there's a risk
that more bad news will come out. It's getting closer to the
point where he's causing more damage to her than helping.""
 Guttenberg, 39, has long been the most popular minister in
Merkel's cabinet. But the aristocrat's popularity was based on
his carefully nurtured image for honesty and integrity. German
media have found scores of copied passages in his dissertation.
 He said he made mistakes but not deliberately.
 Yet some conservatives are cautiously distancing themselves.
Education minister Annette Schavan on Monday called Guttenberg's
actions shameful and parliamentary president Norbert Lammert
said it was ""a nail in the coffin for confidence in democracy"".
 A group of 20,000 academics signed an open letter to Merkel
protesting Guttenberg had made a mockery of academic standards.
 
 RISKY STRATEGY FOR MERKEL
 Merkel can ill-afford any mistakes now ahead of three state
elections in late March -- and two summit meetings in Brussels
where European Union leaders are expected to agree to raise the
size and scope of the euro zone bailout fund.
 ""Sticking with Guttenberg is a risky strategy for Merkel,""
said Ulrich van Alemann, political scientist at Duesseldorf
University. He noted the University of Bayreuth is still
investigating whether he deliberately copied the work of others.
 ""If the university determines it was deliberate, and not
unconscious, as he said, it would mean Guttenberg lied to
parliament,"" van Alemann said. ""I, and many others, consider it
unlikely it was not deliberate. Thus, he's a risk for Merkel.""
 Merkel has defended Guttenberg, saying she picked him
because of his political skills and not because she needed an
""academic assistant."" That comment has upset academics and some
conservatives in the party alarmed about decaying standards.
 ""That's not a convincing argument for the educated classes,""
said Gerd Langguth, political analyst at Bonn University. ""It's
tough to accept that line of reasoning. Merkel is being hurt by
this and there's no easy way out. It could get ugly for her.""
 A March 27 election in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the CDU has
ruled since 1953, is the most important of seven state elections
this year. Losing that conservative bastion after nearly six
decades of uninterrupted rule would be devastating for Merkel.
 Germany's 16 federal states are represented in the upper
house of parliament or Bundesrat, where Merkel lost control via
a state election in North Rhine-Westphalia last year and saw her
power further eroded by a defeat in Hamburg this month. This
makes it more difficult for her to get legislation approved.
 The CDU could also be defeated in Saxony-Anhalt on March 20
and, according to polls, have no chance of ousting the Social
Democrats in Rhine-Palatinate state on March 27.
 The regional elections have had an influence on Germany's
position towards the euro zone bailout fund, which is expected
to be agreed at a March 24-25 European Union summit.
 Any perceived relaxation of debt terms for euro zone
stragglers is a sensitive subject in Germany. The centre-left
opposition has accused Merkel of taking a hardline position in
Europe because of the state elections.
 The Guttenberg affair has overshadowed the euro zone
problems for the moment. Whether Merkel will still be defending
him in a month's time is an open question, analysts said.
 ""It will dawn on Guttenberg sooner or later that he
cheated,"" said Neugebauer at Berlin's Free University. ""Merkel
needs him now before the elections. But let's see what happens
by the start of April.""

tarnish the appeal of U.S. assets, the dollar has been stung by
rising oil prices as investors fret the U.S. economy is more

consumer spending for growth.
 However, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard
said on Monday that oil prices rising on tensions in the Middle

 By Louise Egan and Randall Palmer
 OTTAWA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Canada's economy revved back to
life in late 2010 on the back of surging exports, raising
expectations its central bank will hike interest rates by mid
year and pushing the Canadian dollar to a three-year high.
 The growth rate rose to 3.3 percent annualized in the
fourth quarter, beating the U.S. growth of 2.8 percent and
exceeding the 3 percent market estimate.
 Statscan's revision of third-quarter expansion to 1.8
percent from 1.0 percent provided an extra lift to sentiment as
markets look ahead to the Bank of Canada's interest rate
decision on Tuesday. The central bank is expected to keep rates
unchanged, but may toughen language to prepare the market for
tighter policy in coming months.
 An impressive comeback for exports also helped narrow
Canada's current account deficit to C$11.05 billion ($11.39
billion) in the same quarter from a record C$16.98 billion, the
government statistics agency said.
 ""It's a stunning gain in exports,"" said Sal Guatieri,
senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""It's a fairly solid
report and (there's) plenty of momentum heading into the new
year, given the strong gain in December.""
 The economy advanced 0.5 percent in December on strength in
oil and gas extraction and wholesale trade, again outperforming
the market forecast of 0.3 percent growth.
 The Canadian dollar  rose to C$0.9718 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0290, after the data, its highest level since
February 2008. Money market rates and bond yields rose as
traders priced a higher likelihood that Canadian interest rates
will rise within months. <0#CABMK=>[CAD/]
 The reports show Canada's recovery is gaining steam after a
sluggish period last year when anemic U.S. demand and a strong
currency hit exports.
 Canada sells most of its exports to the United States and
the economy normally grows and shrinks in tandem with its giant
neighbor. However, the country set itself apart during the
global financial crisis as its housing and banking sectors
emerged largely unscathed.
 Strong consumer spending fired the subsequent recovery in
Canada and the jobless rate dropped to below U.S. levels in a
break with historical patterns.

 **********************************************************
 STRONG LANGUAGE
 Lawmakers from the minority Conservative government
immediately boasted that the growth placed Canada at the front
of the pack of the Group of Seven advanced economies. But with
many political observers predicting a spring election over the
budget, the government also attacked opposition calls to cancel
corporate tax cuts as an economic threat.
 ""How incredibly stupid it would be to undermine (the
recovery) through tax hikes,"" wrote Immigration Minister Jason
Kenny on his Twitter feed.
 Investors are now looking to the Bank of Canada's rate
announcement on Tuesday at 9 a.m. (1400 GMT). While nobody
predicts a near-term rate hike, some economists believe the
fourth-quarter gains may prompt the Bank of Canada to adopt a
more hawkish tone in its statement.
 ""While we still believe that the Bank will wait until the
Fed is done easing before it begins to raise rates ... we do
admit that further strong data like today's GDP report ...
raises the odds of the Bank hiking a little sooner,"" said
Jacqui Douglas, a currency strategist at TD Securities.
 The bank raised borrowing costs three times between June
and September last year, bringing its key rate to the current 1
percent level. Analysts polled by Reuters last week saw May 31
as the most likely date for the next increase. [CA/POLL]
 The Bank of Canada, which has a mandate to keep inflation
low, is under little pressure on that front. Canada defied a
global trend of rising price in January, reporting a tame 2.3
percent annual inflation rate and 1.4 percent core inflation.
 The GDP price deflator, a broad measure of price gains in
the economy, showed inflation picking up with a 0.9 percent
quarter-on-quarter gain in the fourth quarter compared with a
0.4 percent increase in the previous quarter.
 The strong currency could continue to dampen inflation,
analysts say, but there is also a risk that the global
commodity price pressures could spill over into the domestic
economy.
 ""Just as the second wind is picking up steam, a new set of
headwinds is emerging in terms of the recent spike in crude
oil, food and energy prices,"" Brian Bethune and Arlene Kish of
IHS Global Insight wrote in a research note.
 CURRENT ACCOUNT SHRINKS
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney had flagged the record
current account deficit in the third quarter as a top concern,
blaming it partly on the sharp currency appreciation.
 But exports once again saved the day in the fourth quarter,
shrinking the gap by C$5.93 billion.
 The balance in trade in goods swung to a C$523 million
surplus from a C$6.42 billion deficit in the third quarter, as
exports of industrial goods and energy products surged.
 Nonetheless, 2010 as a whole saw a record current account
deficit of C$49.98 billion, up from a record C$43.52 billion in
2009.

 OTTAWA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Canada's economy roared back to
life in the fourth quarter of 2010 after a disappointing third
quarter, supporting expectations the Bank of Canada will resume
interest rate hikes in the first half of this year.
 Surging exports and strong consumer spending led to a 3.3
percent annualized rate of growth in the fourth quarter, up
from 1.8 percent in the third quarter, Statistics Canada said
on Monday. Statscan revised the third-quarter figure from 1.0
percent previously.
 The performance beat market expectations of 3.0 percent
growth and far exceeded the central bank's most recent forecast
of 2.3 percent. The bank had made that projection in January
but this month Governor Mark Carney said growth might well
exceed that. Canada also beat U.S. growth, of 2.8 percent, in
the quarter.
 December gross domestic product grew by 0.5 percent from
November, again exceeding market forecasts of 0.3 percent, and
stronger than November's 0.4 percent growth.
 The central bank increased borrowing costs three times
between June and September last year and has kept them on hold
at 1 percent since then. No one expects higher rates at its
decision at 9 a.m. EST (1400 GMT) on Tuesday but markets have
increasingly expected at least one hike by midyear.

 * Most exports go to China
 * Industry body says exports will be uncompetitive
 * India aims to keep more iron ore for domestic steel
 * Shares in producer Sesa Goa slide

 (Adds quote from steel maker)
 By Siddesh Mayenkar
 MUMBAI, Feb 28 (Reuters) - India will quadruple export duty
on iron ore fines as it seeks to curb exports, mostly to China,
in a budget move announced on Monday that hit domestic producer
shares and could push spot prices to new record levels.
 The world's third largest iron ore exporter wants to
conserve supply for domestic steel makers, who play a vital role
in building growing infrastructure.
 India plans to raise the duty to 20 percent from 5 percent
on fines and to 20 percent from 15 percent on lumps.. Fines are
dust form ore with a lower iron content than lumps.
 ""This will make the exports of (Indian) iron ore
uncompetitive in the global market,"" said R.K. Sharma, secretary
general of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI).
 Almost all of India's annual 100 million tonnes of iron ore
exports head to China. Its overseas sales compete with the
world's top two exporters, Australia and Brazil.
 ""This could tighten up the market further,"" said Henry Liu,
regional head of commodity research at Mirae Asset Securities in
Hong Kong.
 ""This will increase the floor price for Indian prices and if
Indian prices increase then that will push prices to China
higher.""
 Shares in Indian iron ore miner Sesa Goa extended losses on
the duty imposition, hitting a 52-week low.
 Steelmakers welcomed the move.
 ""The increase in export duty on iron ore will increase its
availability in the domestic market, thereby stabilising price
and helping domestic steelmakers,"" said Nittin Johari, chief
financial officer of Bhushan Steel.
 
 MORE PRESSURE
 The move was widely expected as India tries to underpin its
rapidly-growing economy with investment in infrastructure.
 China said it could pinch their margins as steel prices
fall.
 ""Steel mills can't take costlier raw materials at the moment
as steel prices were heading downward recently on weak demand,""
said an iron ore official a mid-sized Chinese steel mill, owning
annual crude steel capacity of around 5 million tonnes.
 But with iron ore miners in Australia and Brazil running
flat out to cash in on prices near $200 a tonne, and little
spare capacity elsewhere in the world, Chinese buyers have a
difficult choice -- pay the additional tax, or cut production.
 Iron ore was offered at around $189-191 per tonne with
freight in China on Monday with little immediate impact seen by
traders from the duty hike in a market where contracts are on a
quarterly basis. The record high hit earlier this month was near
$200 per tonne.
 Shipping freight rates could be adversely affected by any
further fall in exports from India.
 ""Freight rates will come under more pressure on this,"" said
a Singapore-based shipbroker. ""Rates are already at two-year
lows on oversupply problems and this will only add to the
problem.""
 India's iron ore exports have already slumped on the ban of
shipments by the southern state of Karnataka -- contested by
exporters in the Supreme Court -- with sales down 24.8 percent
in December to 9.7 million tonnes from a year ago.
 Exports during the April-December period fell 17.02 percent
from a year earlier to 64.4 million tonnes. India usually
exports around 100 million tonnes per year. China buys over 96
million tonnes, making India its third-biggest supplier.
 Two other Indian states, leading producer Orissa and
Chhattisgarh, which accounts for 5 percent of India's shipments,
have asked the federal government to allow them to ban exports.
 The government would prefer states to focus on improved
regulation of the sector and incentives for increased domestic
use of the resource. That would better target illegal production
instead of export bans which hurt all producers.
 India's steel minister, Beni Prasad Verma called for curbs
on exports of iron ore on Friday.
 India hiked freight rates for iron ore exports by 50 percent
to 1,500 rupees per tonne on Jan. 27 but kept it unchanged in
Friday's Railway Budget.
 The increase in export duty would bring in around $1.6
billion annually to New Delhi's coffers on the basis of the
volume and price of exports to China in 2010. That is a fraction
of the government's total expenditure of 12.58 trillion Indian
rupees (nearly $278 billion).

 * Strong demand seen from Sub-Saharan Africa, LatAm, M.East
 
 By Erik dela Cruz
 LOS BANOS, LAGUNA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Rice prices are likely
to remain high as demand rises, but countries can boost supply
and temper prices by switching to climate change-ready
varieties, the head of a rice research agency said on Monday.
 ""We expect global demand in rice to be strong for the
foreseeable future as the population grows,"" said Robert
Zeigler, director general at the International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI).
 Meanwhile, weather conditions are expected to be more severe
in the coming years, with more frequent droughts and flooding
that would stall rice production.
 IRRI has developed new rice varieties that can help farmers
boost production even in extreme weather conditions, Zeigler
said.
 ""We have developed flood-tolerant varieties that have
already been released in the Philippines and Bangladesh, and
farmers are very happy with the yield and the quality,"" he said,
adding that IRRI remained confident of developing more climate
change-ready varieties.
 The Philippines has set a target of attaining rice
self-sufficiency by 2013, and it plans to do so by using
climate-change ready rice varieties.
 Rice, consumed by nearly half of the world's population, has
so far stayed below record-high prices hit in 2008, unlike
recent prices of most other grains such wheat and soybeans.
 ""We see prices trending upwards,"" Zeigler told Reuters after
hosting an exhibit of rice varieties at the agency's 250-hectare
facility in Laguna province south of the capital, Manila.
 ""Growth (in demand) will continue to be strong in
Sub-Saharan Africa, in Latin America, and certainly in the
Middle East,"" he said.
 The benchmark 100 percent B grade white rice from Thailand,
the world's biggest rice exporter, stood at $535 per tonne,
unchanged from last week and steady from the start of the year.
But Vietnamese rice prices are on the rise on strong demand and
with local rice firms beginning to stockpile.
 Zeigler said countries must keep rice supply stable and
prices affordable as demand grows amid the changing weather
patterns that impact crop production.
 ""We had a wake-up call in 2007 and 2008, when the price
spiked and many of us had said that was just the beginning,"" he
said.
 Zeigler said countries, especially those with huge rice
requirements, should invest more to improve irrigation systems,
storage facilities and research.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2011 08:24AM ET</span>","European funds boost cash, bonds; cut equities"," By Caroline Copley
 LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - European fund managers lifted
their cash holdings for a second month in a row and added bonds
as concerns over political instability in the Middle East
prompted them to trim risky assets, a Reuters poll shows.
 The survey of 16 Europe-based asset management firms outside
of Britain showed a typical mixed portfolio holding 48.6 percent
in equities, its lowest since October last year, from a one-year
high of 50.1 percent last month.
 Bond holdings, which include government and corporate debt,
rose to 38.5 percent of asset managers' portfolios, up 1
percentage point since January.
 Cash holdings edged up to 6.1 percent from 6.0 percent.
 Alternatives, including commodities and hedge funds, rose to
5.0 percent from 4.5 percent, reflecting concerns over political
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa that drove oil to
2-1/2 year highs last week.
 The poll was conducted from Feb 17 to 24, when world stocks
shed 3.2 percent at one point from their 30-month high hit on
Feb 18. The benchmark MSCI equity index also posted its biggest
weekly sell-off since late November.
 Investors lifted their allocations of equity investments in
the United States and Canada to 36.3 percent, the highest level
in at least a year, from 34.9 percent in January.
 Allocation to Japanese stocks rose to 7.0 percent from 6.2
percent, its highest in at least a year, while euro zone equity
holdings dropped to 32.9 percent from 33.1 percent, a low not
seen at least since early 2010.
 Fund managers said the risk of inflation in emerging
economies alongside political instability in the Middle East
were the biggest risks to their investment strategies.
 ""(We are concerned by) increasing risk aversion with
declining stock markets,"" said DekaBank wealth manager Frank
Griebel.
 Within equities investors were underweight in the consumer
discretionary sector, reflecting worries that rising prices
might squeeze disposable incomes.
 In fixed income, respondents allocated 62.7 percent of their
portfolios to the euro zone, up from 61.0 percent last month.
 Overall they held 62.4 percent in government securities,
23.7 percent in investment grade corporate paper, and 8.2 in
high-yield bonds.
 Respondents remained most underweight in euro zone
government bonds, while they overweighted corporate paper.

 * Market yet to price in month of Egypt news
 * Investors concerned regional turmoil could also weigh
 
 By Patrick Werr
 CAIRO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for a big
sell-off when Egypt's stock exchange opens on Tuesday after a
month-long shutdown caused by the mass uprising that toppled the
country's president.
 But the reopening could be cut short if share prices do
plunge as this will trigger a trading suspension.
 ""It could be the shortest session on record tomorrow,"" said
an analyst based outside the country.
 The bourse, which will open at 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) on
Tuesday, will suspend trade for a half hour if the benchmark
index declines by 3 percent and for the remainder of the session
if it falls by 6 percent.
 It will also suspend trade for a half hour if the broader
100-share index declines by 5 percent and the whole session if
it falls by 10 percent.
 The government has postponed the exchange's reopening
several times in the last few weeks because of continuing
unrest.
 The protests and a series of subsequent worker stoppages
have left much of the economy in shambles, scaring away tourists
and investors and putting pressure on the country's currency.
 ""The market hasn't priced in a month of Egypt news, and
there is greater risk-aversion regionally and globally than
there was a month ago,"" said Simon Kitchen, Egypt strategist for
Cairo-based investment bank EFG-Hermes.
 The benchmark index tumbled on the two days the market was
open after the protests erupted in late January, losing 6.1
percent on Jan. 26 and another 10.5 percent on Jan. 27, and
analysts said they expect even more declines.
 Akram Annous, MENA strategist at Al Mal Capital, said
negative sentiment might be nearing a peak, but few investors
would be stepping in to take risks.
 ""Unrest is festering in the region and since Egypt closed
there has been Libya, Bahrain and now Oman, while the spectre of
Saudi is causing anxiety for everybody,"" he said.
 Analysts are also concerned about the performance of several
of the exchange's most prominent companies after their top
executives were indicted on corruption charges, and they fear
other companies might be affected as prosecutors pursue
businessmen who were close to the former government.
 Still, some analysts say there could be buying
opportunities.
 ""We see the Egyptian economy shrinking by 2.5 percent in
2011. Taking that into account, the earnings impact is going to
be 10-15 percent,"" said Daniel Broby, chief investment officer
at London-based asset manager, Silk Invest.
 ""The stock market has fallen more than that already and on
that basis, it's looking cheap prior to the unrest period.""
 Kitchen said the preferred companies were those with strong
exposure outside Egypt.
 There was also a preference for two companies, Sidi Kerir
Petrochemicals and AMOC, that are government-controlled, have
high dividend yields and have a relatively small work force, he
said.

 (Adds quote, detail, updates prices)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a 3-1/2-month low
versus a currency basket on Monday on speculation the Federal
Reserve will lag other central banks in raising interest rates
to counter inflation risks stoked by rallying oil prices.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, skidded to 76.812, its
lowest level since Nov. 9.
 Traders said the move below the February trough of 76.881
had triggered fresh-selling by ""model"" accounts, which are based
on computer-generated trading recommendations.
 Analysts said the dollar would stay under selling pressure
ahead of Congressional testimony from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 Investors suspect he will stick to his recent economic
assessment that the recovery is strengthening but still not
enough to bring about a significant improvement in the jobs
market, suggesting the time is not ripe for U.S. rates to rise.
 This would contrast with the European Central Bank, whose
policymakers have been warning against inflation risks. The ECB
holds a policy meeting this week, and some say it may suggest it
is preparing to exit its ultra-loose policy, opening the way to
raising rates.
 ""The Fed has singled itself out among the major central
banks in deciding to maintain very accommodating monetary policy
despite improving data,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency
strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""The market is anticipating Bernanke will maintain his line
from his testimony two weeks ago. If that's the case, it would
put the Fed in a very different light to all other G10 central
banks, and that is the main dollar driver.""
 While ECB officials have focussed on the impact of higher
inflation, the Fed is keeping an eye on growth and have set a
high bar for tweaking their $600 billion bond buying program.
 The euro rose around 0.6 percent versus the dollar to
$1.3845, its strongest since the start of the month. Technical
analysts said a break of the euro's year-to-date high at $1.3862
was needed for added momentum.
 Traders said a UK clearer was a heavy buyer of euros through
the morning, while offers were cited ahead of an option barrier
at $1.3850.
 Along with the view that rock-bottom U.S. rates will tarnish
the appeal of U.S. assets, the dollar has been stung by rising
oil prices as investors fret the U.S. economy is more vulnerable
to higher energy costs, given its strong reliance on consumer
spending for growth.
 Oil prices rose more than $1 per barrel on Monday as
protests in Oman fuelled wider concern about security of supply
from the Middle East after uprisings in Libya dramatically
reduced exports from North Africa.
 ""The ECB sees rising crude as an upside risk to inflation
rather than the Fed's view that it will be negative for growth.
This is increasing the risks of a near-term overshoot for the
euro,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 High inflation risks were highlighted by data showing final
euro zone inflation data for January came in at 2.3 percent
year-on-year, slightly softer than estimates but hovering at a
27-month high.
 ""The dollar is likely to stay weak for now as investors
expecting central banks to hike rates in response to higher oil
prices favour the euro, pound and Swedish krona,"" said UBS FX
analysts in a note.
 Still, an ongoing rise in the euro could make the single
currency susceptible to profit-taking as the latest data showed
currency speculators had boosted bets in favour of the euro to
the highest since October in the week ended Feb. 22.
 The dollar was flat against the Swiss franc at 0.9285 francs
, near a record low of 0.9229 hit on EBS last week.
 The safe-haven Swiss currency has rallied this month on
concerns that uprising in Egypt and Libya could spread to other
countries in the Middle East the North Africa.
 The dollar was steady at 81.88 yen. Traders reported a layer
of strong bids down to 81.00 cushioning the dollar.

 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Britain's coalition government
could swing the balance of the Bank of England's rate-setting
council towards easier policy with an impending appointment,
although it would risk new charges of interference by doing so.
 Arch-hawk Andrew Sentance departs the 9-strong Monetary
Policy Committee at the end of May and his replacement could
radically alter the voting dynamics at a time when its members
are unusually divided.
 Sentance -- whose replacement is expected to be announced
within days -- has called for higher interest rates since last
June and has won over two supporters this year -- MPC newcomer
Martin Weale and BoE chief economist Spencer Dale.
 The remaining six members of the committee voted to keep
interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent, but minutes showed
several would be prepared to tighten policy if the economic
recovery looked more assured. [ID:nLDE71M0TH]
 The government nomination is a sensitive one, not just
because of the tussle on the committee -- one that even Governor
Mervyn King has not tried to conceal -- but also on gender
grounds, given that the panel is currently all-male.
 ""Sentance is by far and away the most hawkish person on the
MPC so the balance of probabilities is that he will be replaced
by someone less hawkish,"" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS.
 ""There's clearly a lot of speculation it will be a woman but
the key thing is to get the right person for the job.""
 While the government has stuck to the mantra that the BoE is
independent, at a time of severe budget cutbacks, it would suit
it for monetary policy to remain supportive of growth in spite
of inflation that is twice the bank's target.
 The four ""external"" members of the MPC are appointed by the
government and serve a three-year term, which may be renewed.
The remaining five MPC members are BoE ""insiders"" and comprise
the governor, two deputy governors and two executive directors.
 The selection of an external MPC member gives the government
a rare opportunity to influence the tone of Britain's monetary
policy debate, an area where politicians are traditionally
reluctant to tread.
 However, predicting the stance of an MPC appointee will vote
when in office is not always easy. Sentance's business
background led many to predict he would be on the dovish end of
the spectrum -- something that proved not to be the case.
 
 WOMAN CANDIDATES
 The MPC has been an all-male institution ever since Kate
Barker left in May last year after serving an unprecedented
three terms, each of three-year duration.
 Only four women have served on the MPC since its creation in
1997 when the Bank of England was granted operational
independent from government.
 A number of women have been tipped, among them Vicky Pryce,
a former head of the government's economic service, Bridget
Rosewell, the founder of several economics consultancies and
Lucrezia Reichlin, professor of economics at London Business
School and a former research director at the European Central
Bank.
 Other names touted include Sheila Dow, emeritus professor at
the University of Stirling and Janet Henry, chief European
economist at HSBC.
 Pryce told Reuters on Monday that she had not applied for
the job.
 ""I think it would be a very good thing to have a woman on
the MPC but it was not the right time for me unfortunately,"" she
said.
 She said current arrangements, under which ""external""
members of the committee are only paid for a three-day week, did
not economists in government or the private sector.
 ""Being on the MPC severely restricts what you can do for the
remaining two days. It may appeal to academics who can continue
that line of work but otherwise it's very restraining.""
 If the government opts to appoint another man, John
Llewellyn, a former chief of staff at the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, and Geoffrey Dicks, a
founding member of the Office for Budget Responsibility have
been touted as good candidates. However, a member of Llewellyn's
office told Reuters on Monday he had not gone for the job.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to three-month
lows on Monday on expectations that the threat to growth from
high oil prices would keep U.S. monetary policy loose,
contrasting with a more hawkish outlook elsewhere.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, skidded to 76.812, its
lowest level since November 9. The euro accounts for over half
of the basket.
 Traders said the move below the February trough of 76.881
had triggered fresh-selling by ""model"" accounts, which are based
on computer-generated trading recommendations.
 The U.S. unit has been hit hard by rising oil prices as
investors fret the U.S. economy will suffer more than others,
given its strong reliance on consumer spending for growth.
 Prices rose more than $1 per barrel on Monday as protests in
Oman fuelled wider concern about security of supply from the
Middle East after uprisings in Libya dramatically reduced
exports from North Africa.
 ""Rising oil prices help to widen the perceived policy
divergence between the Fed and other major central banks,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ
 ""The ECB sees rising crude as an upside risk to inflation
rather than the Fed's view that it will be negative for growth.
This is increasing the risks of a near-term overshoot for the
euro.""
 The euro rose around 0.6 percent versus the dollar at
$1.3845, a four-week high. Technical analysts said a break of
the euro's year-to-date high at $1.3862 was needed for added
momentum.
 Traders said a UK clearer was a heavy buyer of euros through
the morning, while offers were cited ahead of an option barrier
at $1.3850.
 The euro was susceptible to profit-taking as the latest data
showed currency speculators had boosted bets in favour of the
euro to the highest since October in the week ended Feb. 22.
 But expectations that the European Central Bank at its
meeting on Thursday may signal its willingness to raise rates
were supporting the euro, after a series of ECB policymakers
have sounded a hawkish tone in recent weeks.
 
 FED EYES GROWTH
 Final euro zone inflation data for January came in slightly
softer than the estimate at 2.3 percent year-on-year but that
did little to dent the euro.
 ""The fact remains that euro zone consumer price inflation is
still at a 27-month high and set to rise further in the near
term due to the spike in oil prices as well as elevated
commodity and food prices,"" said Howard Archer, chief European
economist at IHS Global Insight.
 In contrast, Fed officials are keeping an eye on growth and
have set a high bar for tweaking their $600 billion bond buying
program. Financial markets will look to congressional testimony
by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke this week to try to discern the
current state of debate within the central bank.
 ""The dollar is likely to stay weak for now as investors
expecting central banks to hike rates in response to higher oil
prices favour the euro, pound and Swedish krona,"" said UBS fx
analysts in a note.
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc at
0.9265 francs, near a record low of 0.9229 hit on EBS last week.
 The dollar was steady at 81.74 yen, with traders reporting a
layer of strong bids down to 81.00 cushioning the pair.

 By John Acher and Mette Fraende
 COPENHAGEN, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Denmark's gross domestic
product shrank by 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 from
the third, declining for the first time in six quarters and
defying economists' expectations of modest growth.
 GDP grew 2.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of
2010 as the Danish recovery again showed signs of lagging its
Nordic neighbours. That was at the weak end of forecasts from
four economists surveyed by Reuters, ranging from 2.7 percent to
3.4 percent.
 ""The negative quarterly growth comes after five quarters
with positive growth,"" the national statistics office said in
the statement.
 Economists in the survey had expected fourth-quarter GDP to
grow by 0.4 percent from the third quarter, according to the
median estimate.
 ""It looks like we are having a hard time connecting to the
global economic upswing,"" Handelsbanken Capital Markets chief
economist Jes Asmussen said.
 ""The question now is if the economic slowdown was temporary,
or if we are headed for a new recession in the Danish economy,""
Asmussen said, adding that he expected global growth impulses to
help Denmark ""keep itself free of the claws of recession.""
 Danske Bank chief economist Steen Bocian also said he did
not see the weakness as a new trend and noted that quarterly GDP
figures are subject to considerable uncertainty and variation.
 Nordea Markets senior analyst Jan Nielsen called the
fourth-quarter drop ""highly surprising.""
 The fourth-quarter figures brought 2010 GDP growth to 2.1
percent after a plunge of 5.1 percent in 2009 when Denmark was
in the grip of its worst recession since the Second World War.
 ""An increase of 2.1 percent, however, is not particularly
impressive seen in light of the decline in economic activity of
more than 5 percent in the previous year,"" Asmussen said.
 The full-year 2010 GDP growth slightly exceeded the
government's and central bank's forecasts from December of 2.0
percent. The government has forecast that growth will slow to
1.7 percent this year.
 The value of Danish fourth-quarter GDP was 452.8 billion
Danish crowns ($83.6 billion), the statistics agency said.
 ""Private consumption and investments grew but public
consumption and foreign trade contributed negatively to the GDP
development,"" Statistics Denmark said in the statement.
 Fourth-quarter GDP data from Denmark's Scandinavian
neighbour and major trading partner Sweden are due on Tuesday.
 Up through the third quarter of 2010, Denmark's recovery
clearly lagged that of its northern neighbour. Swedish GDP grew
by a record 6.9 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, while
Danish GDP grew by 3.3 percent in the same period.
 Norway's mainland economy grew a weaker-than-expected 0.3
percent in the fourth quarter, but Norwegian non-oil GDP grew
2.2 percent for the year, which economists said was a fairly
robust recovery from a 2009 contraction.

 By Kate Holton 
 DUBLIN, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Ireland's Aer Lingus could
further cut capacity in 2011 if high fuel prices persist, as the
airline fears rising costs and higher airport charges will
derail the recovery it enjoyed in the past year.
 The airline said on Monday it had hedged 62 percent of its
fuel needs for 2011 but would need to review certain
cost-sensitive routes if the cost of fuel did not come down.
 At current fuel prices, its 2011 operating profit would be
significantly below its 2010 figure, it said.
 The group also warned that it could be constrained in its
ability to pass on rising costs via fuel surcharges because its
domestic market was so weak, after the country turned to the
European Union and International Monetary Fund for a bailout.
 ""We expect significant challenges in 2011, with trading for
the year likely to be impacted by fuel price inflation and
increased airport charges in combination with difficult
conditions in our home market,"" Chief Executive Christoph
Mueller said. 
 ""We do not expect that improvements in yield performance and
ongoing cost savings can offset these increased costs. If
current fuel prices persist, we expect that 2011 operating
profit will be significantly below that of 2010.""
 Shares in the group were up 0.5 percent to 0.95 euros as
investors welcomed the improved 2010 performance, but analysts
noted the cautious comments about 2011.
 
 AHEAD OF FORECASTS 
 Aer Lingus said it had posted a 2010 operating profit of
57.6 million euros ($79.3 million), a swing in profitability of
139 million euros and ahead of forecasts, despite bad weather
and the volcanic ash cloud which severely disrupted its flights.
 The improved performance followed cost cuts and 12 percent
increase in average yield per passenger.
 ""We believe that Aer Lingus continues to look cheap but, as
indicated, a fuel-related downgrade is likely,"" analysts at
brokerage Davy said in a note.
 Airlines including International Airlines Group, recently
formed by the merger of British Airways and Iberia, have warned
that ticket prices could rise again as political instability in
the Middle East pushes up fuel prices.
 Aer Lingus, which said it expected its 2011 fuel bill to be
substantially higher than in 2010, posted full-year revenue of
1.22 billion euros, in line with an average forecast gathered by
Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating profit was ahead of average forecasts
of 42 million.
 Another area of uncertainty for Aer Lingus was over its
ownership. The previous Irish government had shielded the
airline from arch-rival Ryanair, saying it would only sell its
25 percent in the carrier to a party that can guarantee its
independence.
 Mueller said he expected the new Irish government, which was
voted in at the weekend, to not change anything on that front.

 ""The Aer Lingus share is currently still undervalued,"" he
said. ""The government would certainly be ill-advised to sell at
a time when the outcome won't be optimal for taxpayers.""

 LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered close to
three-month lows on Monday, hampered by expectations that the
threat to growth from high oil prices would keep U.S. monetary
policy loose, in contrast to the more hawkish outlooks of other
major central banks.
 The Swiss franc remained firm as ongoing tensions in Libya
and fears of contagion kept its safe-haven attraction intact.
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at

 The euro was up around 0.1 percent versus the dollar at

Friday. Technical analysts said a break of the euro's
year-to-date high at $1.3862 was needed for fresh momentum.

 The euro was steady at 1.2750 francs, with key support is
seen at 1.2705 francs, a level representing a 61.8 percent
retracement of the euro's December to February rally.
 The dollar was steady at 81.72 yen, lacking momentum before
a series of events this week.
 As well as testimony from Bernanke, a European Central Bank
policy meeting and U.S. jobs data are due, which could set the
tone for the market in coming weeks.
 
 IRELAND CHANGE
 There was little reaction to news that Ireland's main
opposition party claimed a historic election victory, after the
government was routed at the polls.
 Some analysts cautioned that the new government could cause
a ripple in coming weeks as it seeks to renegotiate the terms of
a bailout scheme, although the majority of market players see
limited chance Dublin will take measures that could shock
investors, such as forcing losses on senior bank bonds.
 ""If the incoming government is to obtain concessions on
reducing the interest rate charged and extensions of the
repayment maturity of the loans, it is unlikely that there will
be much room to negotiate on haircuts on senior bank debt,"" said

 * Dollar hits 3-mth low; Brent crude dips
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Monday and
were on track to post their third straight month of gains,
although traders remained wary that sustained high oil prices
would hurt global growth.
 The dollar fell to a three-month low on expectations that
the uncertain outlook, including firmer oil prices driven by
political unrest in the oil-producing Middle East and North
Africa, would keep U.S. monetary policy loose.
 Oil prices reversed gains to trade slightly weaker, though
they have gained sharply this month on concerns over supply
disruption from the oil-rich region.
 Copper prices extended the previous session's 3 percent
gains after an earthquake in top producer Chile, though
benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries were also in demand, sending
yields to below 3.40 percent -- their lowest in four weeks.
 World equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
added 0.3 percent after rising 1.1 percent on Friday. The
global index is up 2.3 percent this month, on track for a third
straight monthly rise.
 ""The question is how high it (oil price) is going and how
permanent is the spike,"" said Nick Nelson, equity strategist at
UBS in London.
 ""If it's something that it's going to maintain itself for
six months, 12-months from this, obviously it's going to be much
more damaging for the economy than it is just something happens
for one or two weeks and then go back down again.""
 U.S. stock index futures were flat to up 0.1 percent.
Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.9 percent, helped by a weaker yen.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.2 percent, while
Ireland's stocks slipped 0.4 percent.
 Ireland's main opposition party said it would start urgent
talks on forming a new government in a bid to turn its landslide
election win into a mandate to renegotiate a bailout deal with
Europe.
 According to fund tracker EPFR Global, a growing aversion to
risky assets in the latest week fuelled the biggest flows to
global bond funds in more three months, and turned more
investors away from emerging market stocks.
Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries eased 1 basis
point to 3.4069 percent on Monday after falling as low as 3.3904
percent.
 The rotation out of emerging markets into developed markets,
partly driven by inflation concerns in emerging economies, have
led to outperformance in developed markets. The MSCI emerging
market index has lost 4.2 percent this year.
 But Credit Suisse's private bank expected the fund rotation
to ease in the second quarter.
 ""As the current level of net foreign selling has already
reached the average size of foreign selling in the previous
non-recession corrections, we expect to see a gradual easing of
the DM versus EM rotation flows and redemption of EM and Asian
equity funds in the coming months, as foreign investors appear
to be getting close to capitulation point,"" it said in a note.
 DOLLAR DOWN, OIL STEADY
 The greenback was down 0.6 percent against a basket of major
currencies, its lowest since Nov. 9, as traders expect higher
oil prices would keep U.S. monetary policy loose.
 ""Rising oil prices help to widen the perceived policy
divergence between the Fed and other major central banks,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 ""The ECB sees rising crude as an upside risk to inflation
rather than the Fed's view that it will be negative for growth.
This is increasing the risks of a near-term overshoot for the
euro."" The euro was up 0.6 percent at $1.3862.
 Brent crude dipped 0.3 percent after trading as high as
$114.50 a barrel on Monday. U.S. crude futures were steady at
below $98 a barrel, paring earlier gains.
 Revolt in Libya has cut as much as three quarters of the
OPEC member's output, prompting Saudi Arabia to step in and plug
the supply gap to Libya's oil buyers.
 Brent crude is up more than 10 percent this month, heading
towards its sixth straight month of rises. It touched a 29-month
high of near $120 a barrel last week.
 Copper rose for the third day and is up 0.5 percent this
month, on track for its eighth month of gains.

 By Ludwig Burger 
 LEVERKUSEN, Germany, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Bayer's new chief
executive damped market expectations for underlying profit for
the next two years as generic rivals weigh on its top-selling
pharmaceuticals and after writing down some drug research
projects.
 Germany's largest drugmaker said on Monday it expects
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) to rise ""toward"" 7.5 billion euros ($10.32 billion)
this year and to reach about 8 billion euros in 2012.
 Analysts had factored in figures of 7.8 billion and 8.5
billion for 2011 and 2012, respectively.
 Sales from Bayer's multiple sclerosis injection Betaferon
are threatened by Novartis's oral alternative as well as generic
copies. Copy-cat versions of its Yasmin birth-control pill are
also dampening revenue prospects.
 That prompted CEO Marijn Dekkers to launch a round of job
cuts shortly after taking over in October.
He said on Monday that strained healthcare budgets would
continue to be an additional burden on the business.
 ""We expect (health system) reforms to have a significant
negative impact in 2011 as well,"" Dekkers said.
 The shares slid 0.7 percent at 0805 GMT, while Germany's
benchmark DAX was down 0.3 percent.
 Growth this year will likely be driven by a recovery from
pesticides and chemicals, while a boost from a new drug will not
kick in before next year.
 The drugs to chemicals group is pinning hopes on its
anti-blood-clotting pill Xarelto which in November was shown to
have mass-market potential in a late-stage trial.
 While Bayer reiterated on Monday it expects more than 2
billion euros in annual sales from the drug, a reassessment of a
number of smaller drug development projects prompted it to write
down their book values.
 These reappraisals -- 267 million euro of which for the
cancer drug Zevalin alone -- led to a net loss of 145 million
euros while analysts had predicted a profit of 316 million.
 Business at it is pesticides and plastics divisions,
however, is perking up, lifting fourth-quarter adjusted core
profit 4 percent above analyst projections.
 The MaterialScience division, the world's largest maker of
padding and insulation foams and of plastics used in car lights,
is tapping recovering demand from car makers and builders.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The dollar found a steadier
footing on Monday as market players covered short positions ahead
of a series of important events this week that could drastically
change its recent range-bound trend.
 The Swiss franc remained firm, however, both against the
dollar and the euro, as ongoing tensions in Libya and fears of
contagion kept its safe-haven attraction intact.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.9270 francs, edging closer to a record low of 0.9229 hit on EBS
last week.
 The euro also slipped 0.2 percent to 1.2740 francs, down
slightly from 1.2763 late in New York on Friday.
 Key support is seen at 1.2705 francs, a level representing a
61.8 percent retracement of the euro's December to February
rally.
 Against the greenback, the euro slipped as Japanese investors
and model players sold the currency, thinking the currency is
unlikely to have the momentum to break above major resistance
ahead of a series of events.
 This week will see testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke, a European Central Bank policy meeting and U.S.
jobs data, which could set the tone of the market in coming
weeks.
 ""I suspect we will be in for a rollercoaster ride this week
given heavy schedules. But the dollar could end higher than it is
now at the end of the week, if things point to a recovery in the
U.S. economy,"" said Sumino Kamei, senior analyst at the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The euro was susceptible to profit-taking as the latest data
showed currency speculators had boosted bets in favour of the
euro to the highest since Oct in the week ended Feb. 22.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3743, falling further from
three-week highs of $1.3837 marked on Friday, as bulls abandoned
hope of it trying its Feb. 2 high of $1.3862 in the near future.
 While expectations that the European Central Bank may signal
its willingness to raise rates at its meeting on Thursday have
been supporting the euro, some traders say there is scope for
disappointment.
 ""I wonder if they would really raise interest rates when some
countries in the currency bloc are still having troubles in
accessing liquidity,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage.

 Some analysts cautioned that the new government could cause a
ripple in coming weeks as it seeks to renegotiate the terms of a
bailout scheme, although the majority of market players see
limited chance Dublin will take measures that could shock
investors, such as forcing losses on senior bank bonds.
 ""If the incoming government is to obtain concessions on
reducing the interest rate charged and extensions of the
repayment maturity of the loans, it is unlikely that there will
be much room to negotiate on haircuts on senior bank debt,"" said
Takuji Okubo, chief economist at Societe Generale.
 The dollar index, which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was little changed
at 77.280 but off three-week lows of 76.945 plumbed last week.
 A break below 76.881 would have the index back at lows not
seen since early November.
 The dollar has been hit hard by rising oil prices as
investors fret the U.S. economy will suffer more than others,
given its strong reliance on consumer spending for growth.
 It hardly moved against the yen at 81.65, near the lower end
of its 81-84 yen band this year, after having failed miserably to
clear resistance around 84.00 earlier this month.
 The Australian dollar was a touch softer at $1.0152, down 0.2
percent on the day, as investors took profits on last week's
gains,
 The currency was not helped by comments by Chinese prime
minister Wen Jiabao at the weekend that the country's official
GDP target for 2011-2015 growth plan is 7% per year.
 That is significantly below the average annual 11.2 percent
growth in the last five-year period, although official targets
tend to undershoot actual performance.
 But the currency held comfortably above $1.01 ahead of a slew
of economic data including the fourth quarter gross domestic
product report on Wednesday.
 This week's data is not expected to change market views that
the Reserve Bank of Australia will keep rates on hold for the time
being. Analysts polled by Reuters on Friday expect the RBA to
resume hiking interest rates gradually from the second quarter
onwards.
 No one seriously expects the RBA to hike rates at this
week's policy meeting given RBA governor Glenn Stevens recently
said the central bank was ahead of the policy game and market
pricing of no rate hike until later in the year was reasonable.
 ""The plethora of recent communications leaves the
impression that while retaining a positive outlook, the RBA is
comfortable with current financial conditions,"" said David Watt,
strategist at RBC Dominion Securities.
 ""As so much has been said of late, the statement could be
rather brief. We continue to anticipate 50bp of rate hikes by
year end.""

 By Masayuki Kitano 
 SINGAPORE, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Monday as
financial shares clawed back some of last week's losses and
higher oil prices buoyed energy stocks, but gains were capped by
fears of futher outflows from emerging equities to developed
markets.	
 London crude prices rose by more than $2 at one point to
$114.50 a barrel as worsening turmoil in Libya spurred
fresh concern about disruptions to oil production.	
 Recent unrest in the Middle East pushed London crude prices
to nearly $120 last week, their highest level since August 2008,
exacerbating worries about inflationary pressures in emerging
Asian economies.	
 Market players said emerging Asian stock markets may
continue to underperform compared to developed markets such as
Japan and the United States.	
 Underscoring the recent trend, MSCI's index of Japanese
shares rose 1 percent, taking its gains for far
in 2011 to nearly 6 percent, while its Indonesian index has shed
some 7.5 percent .	
 ""There are strong concerns about inflation based on
excessive liquidity and emerging markets have been hurt more by
this,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management in Tokyo.	
 ""Developed countries...are not raising interest rates while
emerging markets are in the midst of doing so. That is negative
for (emerging market) equities and that trend will probably
still continue,"" Akino added.	
 The Nikkei recouped early losses to end 0.9 percent
higher on Monday, with some traders attributing the bounce to
futures-led buying on a weaker yen against the euro and to
month-end window dressing. 
 Some Japanese financial shares saw strong gains with Mizuho
Trust & Banking Co Ltd jumping 6 percent after a source
told Reuters that its parent Mizuho Financial planned
to buy it out along with two other units. 
 MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
edged up 0.2 percent after hitting three-month
lows last week on worries that anti-government protests would
spread to other Middle East oil producing countries. The
ex-Japan index has lost more than 3 percent so far this year.	
 Part of the divergence with developed markets likely
reflects position unwinding, said Adrian Foster, head of
financial markets research with Rabobank International in Hong
Kong.	
 Late last year, massive liquidity driven rallies in global
equity markets helped give a boost to emerging market shares,
Foster said.	
 ""That largely explains why (emerging) equity markets this
year have been quite weak. Just the unwinding of these...
particularly in India and also in Indonesia,"" Foster added.	
 A growing aversion to risky assets in the week to Feb. 23
fueled the biggest flows to global bond funds in more than three
months, and turned more investors away from emerging market
stocks, according to fund tracker EPFR Global. 
 With more than $20 billion leaving emerging market stock
funds since mid-January, it is the longest period of outflows
since the financial crisis deepened in September 2008.	
 
 
 DOLLAR FINDS FOOTING	
 The dollar found a steadier footing, having rebounded after
hitting a record low against the Swiss franc on Friday, but the
mood remained cautious given tensions in Libya and fears of
contagion.	
 The dollar last stood at 0.9270 francs , down 0.2
percent on the day but above a record low of 0.9229 hit against
the safe haven Swiss currency on trading platform EBS on Friday.	
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.3744
, but the single currency was seen staying in favour ahead
of a European Central Bank meeting this week.	
 ""With rising commodity prices, the ECB will likely continue
its tough talk on inflation, increasing the probability of early
ECB tightening,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note.	
 Traders said the euro ran into some profit-taking as did the
Australian dollar, which fell 0.3 percent to $1.0143 .	
 Elsewhere, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 6/32 in
price to yield 3.394 percent on worries that higher
fuel prices could stunt economic growth, while gold edged
up 0.3 percent to $1,413.10.	
 Gold, a traditional safe haven, was on course for a 6.2
percent monthly gain, its biggest since November 2009.

 SINGAPORE, Feb 28 (Reuters) - London crude prices rose by
more than $1 and Asian shares edged lower on Monday, as the
worsening situation in Libya stirred renewed concern about
disruptions to oil production.	
 The dollar found a steadier footing, having rebounded after
hitting a record low against the Swiss franc on Friday, but the
mood remained cautious given the tensions in Libya and fears of
contagion.	
 The dollar last stood at 0.9290 francs , steady from
late U.S. trade on Friday and above a record low of 0.9229 hit

 ""With rising commodity prices, the ECB will likely continue

 In Libya, armed rebels who have seized control of Zawiyah,
close to the capital Tripoli, were preparing for a
counter-attack as Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi vowed to cling
on to his 41-year-old rule. 
 
 London crude prices rose by more than $1 to near $114 a
barrel , edging back in the direction of last Thursday's
high of $119.79, which was their loftiest intraday level since
August 2008.	
 Worries that the surge in oil prices could hurt global
economic growth had helped drag equities lower last week, with
MSCI's broad measure of Asia-Pacific equities outside Japan
having hit its lowest in nearly three months of 454.70
last Thursday.	
 The MSCI Asia-Pacific index dipped 0.3 percent on Monday to
460.37, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average fell 0.6
percent .	
 South Korean shares fell 0.5 percent , pressured by
falls in automakers and shipbuilders.

 (Updates with details, background)
 By Shaimaa Fayed
 CAIRO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Egypt's stock exchange, closed for
a month because of the protests that ousted President Hosni
Mubarak, will reopen on Tuesday, the cabinet said in a
statement.
 Continuing unrest has delayed the market's reopening several
times in the last few weeks and analysts have been bracing for a
possible sell-off of shares as investors flee risk when trade
resumes.
 The market's benchmark index fell 6.1 percent on Jan. 26 and
another 10.5 percent on Jan. 27, the only two days of trade
since the protests erupted.
 After meeting the stock exchange chairman and the financial
regulator, Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq presented proposals to
prepare for the resumption of trade, a cabinet statement said on
Sunday.
 ""This is in light of the bourse's decision to resume trading
on Tuesday, March 1, 2011,"" the statement said.
 The bourse will suspend trade for a half hour if the
benchmark index declines by 3 percent and for the remainder of
the session if it falls by 6 percent, the state news agency MENA
quoted the bourse head as saying.
 It will also suspend trade for a half hour if the broader
100-share index declines by 5 percent and the whole session if
it falls by 10 percent, MENA said.
 MSCI said on Friday Egypt would risk being excluded from its
emerging markets index if the market did not reopen before MSCI
reviewed its status in four weeks. The cabinet statement said
Shafiq also asked the head of the Egyptian Financial Suprvisory
Authority (EFSA), Ziad Bahaa el-Din, to draw up rules to prevent
financial conflicts of interest by government officials.
 He appointed Bahaa el-Din's deputy, Ashraf Al Sharkawy, to
take over as EFSA's chairman in his place.
 The Finance Ministry will provide loans to help brokerage
firms hurt by the turmoil and the bourse closure, Mohamed Abdel
Salam, chairman of the stock exchange's Clearing Settlement and
Central Depositary, told state television on Sunday.

 He warned that too rapid an appreciation could hurt social

 * Government determined to stamp out graft 
(Adds quotes and details) 
 By Chris Buckley and Ken Wills	
 BEIJING, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Fighting inflation is a priority
for China and the government must ward off threats to social
stability stemming from rapid price increases and pressure to
raise the value of the yuan, Premier Wen Jiabao said on Sunday. 
 Wen's comments ahead of China's annual parliament session
from March 5 showed the sensitivity among ruling Communist Party
leaders to public grumbling about rising real estate and food
prices.	
 That wariness has been amplified by jitters about fallout
from the unseating of authoritarian rulers in the Middle East.	
 Wen, speaking on an online forum, steered clear of problems
in the Middle East, stressing instead that his real fears are
homegrown and bound up with economic pressures, especially
disquiet about prices, jobs and corruption. 
 ""Rapid price rises have affected the public and even social
stability,"" Wen said.	
 ""The Party and government have always made a priority of
keeping prices at a generally stable level.""	
 China has ample grain and ""abundant"" foreign exchange
reserves that would help to keep price rises in check, Wen
added. But he did not say how the government might use its
foreign exchange reserves for that end. 


 Wen also said that maintaining social stability was central
to the country's foreign exchange policy, and required a
cautious approach to increasing the value of the yuan.	
 China would adjust exchange rate policy ""in a prudent,
step-by-step, gradual way, so that our businesses can steadily
adapt and overall social stability is maintained,"" he said.	
 The jobs of millions of poor rural migrants were at stake,
said Wen, fending off criticism from foreign governments,
particularly the United States, that have urged a more rapid
rise in the currency that would make Chinese exports more
expensive.	
 ""If the yuan saw a one-off large appreciation, that would
cause many closures of our processing enterprises and make many
export orders shift to other countries and many of our workers
will lose jobs,"" he said.	
 China has about 242 million rural residents who work off the
farm, and about 153 million of them are migrants who work
outside their home towns, including tens of millions in export
zones making cheap goods for the rest of the world.	
 ""Let them think about that. If businesses go bankrupt,
workers become unemployed and rural migrant workers go home,
then what do we have to expand domestic consumption, where will
increased consumption come from?"", Wen said of his critics.	
 
 STAMPING OUT CORRUPTION	
 Wen, whose term ends in early 2013, highlighted the
political risks if the public starts to see inflation as a
side-effect of official self-enrichment.	
 He said the government was determined to stamp out graft and
corruption, citing the recent dismissal of Liu Zhijun, the
former railways minister who is suspected of corruption.	
 ""I have in fact said before that if price rises become
linked to the problems of graft and corruption, that will be
enough to spark public discontent, and even create serious
social problems,"" Wen said.	
 Wen said the official GDP target was 7 percent per year for
the 2011-2015 growth plan. That rate is significantly below the
average annual 11.2 percent growth in the last five-year period,
but official targets tend to undershoot actual performance.	
 Chinese annual inflation accelerated lower-than-expected 4.9
percent in January, but price pressures remain strong. Food
prices rose 10.3 percent. 
 To help rein in inflation, China raised interest rates on
Feb. 8, the third rate increase since Beijing began a monetary
tightening cycle in earnest in October.	
 Beijing has also imposed a slew of measures to target
property prices that have stayed stubbornly high. 
 ""I'm confident that through our efforts, we'll see results
in reining in speculative and investment purchases of housing,""
said Wen. The government aims to ensure that 36 million units of
affordable housing for poorer workers are built by 2015, he
added.

 * Adequate liquidity needed to safeguard stability
 * UniCredit: capital is priority, we have enough
 
 (Adds details, background, Unicredit comments)
 By Ian Simpson
 VERONA, Italy, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Italian banks should use
profits to underpin capital bases and a turn to markets to boost
capital seems inevitable, European Central Bank Governing
Council member Mario Draghi said on Saturday.
 Taking renewed aim at lenders' dividends, Draghi, who is
also head of the Bank of Italy, said maintaining adequate
reserves of liquidity was vital to safeguard stability and
assure lending.
 ""We expect that as in 2009 a large part of last year's
profits will be allocated to increasing the banks' capital.
Nevertheless, recourse to the capital market would also appear
unavoidable as soon as conditions permit,"" he said in a speech
at the AIAF-ASSIOM Forex conference.
 ""Prudence should not be sacrificed to considerations of
profit,"" said Draghi, who urged banks in March 2010 to
strengthen capital rather than pay out dividends.
 Italian banks are at the low end among European lenders in
terms of capital ratios. They face having to raise them to meet
Basel III rules aimed at avoiding a repeat of the financial
crisis.
 Draghi said the conservative policies of Italian banks had
intially shielded them in the crisis. However, profits have
since been squeezed and boosting capital was vital, especially
with the upcoming launch of the Basel III rules.
 ""For banks to be prepared when the new capital adequacy
rules are fully phased in, capital strengthening must proceed,
above all through retained earnings,"" he said.
 Federico Ghizzoni, the chief executive of UniCredit SpA,
Italy's biggest bank by market value, said UniCredit had
adequate capital and it was up to individual banks to decide if
they needed an increase.
 ""I agree with Draghi that the priority is the capital base.
But as to the dividend, that is up to the shareholders,"" he told
reporters after the address.
 Chairman Dieter Rampl also said UniCredit had no need for a
capital increase. UniCredit carried out two capital increases
during the financial crisis.
 Ghizzoni has said UniCredit aims to continue to pay a
dividend on 2010 results.
 Among other lenders, Banco Popolare concluded a 2 billion
euro capital increase this month.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2011 07:12AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-ECB's Draghi says must watch inflation threat," * Policy must stop inflation expectations building
 * Core inflation still low
 * North African crisis could hit uncertain global recovery
 
 VERONA, Italy, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Monetary policy makers
must closely watch emerging inflation tensions to head off any
decline in expectations for price stability, European Central
Bank Governing Council member Mario Draghi said on Saturday.
 In a speech in the northern Italian town of Verona, Draghi
said core inflation in the euro area remained low, despite sharp
rises in commodity prices which pushed consumer inflation in
January to 2.4 percent, well above the ECB's target zone.
 ""However, the appearance of inflationary tensions does
require that we carefully assess the timing and methods for
restoring normal monetary conditions and interest rates,"" he
said, according to a text of his speech.
 ""Monetary policy must prevent a deterioration of
expectations, in order to keep the stimulus of international
prices from passing through to domestic prices and wages in the
longer-term.""
 Draghi's comments, which chime with warnings from other
policy makers of mounting inflationary pressures, come a day
after data in Germany, the euro area's biggest economy, showed
pressure on consumer prices continued in February.
 The ECB is expected to leave interest rates at a record low
of 1 percent next week but recent comments from board members
have strengthened expectations that it could start gradually
withdrawing its crisis support next month.
 Draghi, a leading contender to take over as president of the
ECB when current incumbent Jean-Claude Trichet steps down later
this year, said that a gradual tightening of policy would not
necessarily threaten growth prospects, even in weaker economies.
 ""Real short-term interest rates that are markedly negative,
as they have been over the past two years, have not improved the
growth prospects of the less dynamic economies,"" he said. ""As
economic policies reach the end of their expansionary phase,
this will not necessarily endanger growth.
 ""In the weakest countries, in particular, the cost of
borrowing could benefit from the narrowing of spreads on
government securities following the adjustment of budget
policies and from the containment of risk premiums as inflation
expectations are kept under control,"" he said.
 He said the world economic recovery was continuing amid
considerable uncertainty and sharply divergent growth rates
could easily accentuate the volatility of exchange rates and
interest rates, jeopardizing the recovery.
 Referring to the turmoil that has swept north African
countries including OPEC member Libya, Draghi said that in
addition to the human dimension of the crisis, the unrest could
have a potential impact on growth by pushing up oil prices.
 He said Italy, one of the slowest growing economies in the
world over the past decade and one which depends on imported
energy, a 20 percent rise in oil prices would cut half a
percentage point off growth over three years.

(Adds details, quotes)	
 By Adrian Bathgate	
 WELLINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Violent aftershocks hampered
desperate efforts to find survivors in the quake-ruined New
Zealand city of Christchurch on Saturday as the death toll
climbed to 123 and was set to rise further.	
 Rescue teams from New Zealand and six countries including
the United States, China, Japan and Australia scoured the rubble
of levelled buildings in the central city and suburban areas
hardest hit by Tuesday's 6.3 tremor -- but found only bodies.	
 ""It's a sad morning with the confirmed death toll now up to
123 people,"" local mayor Bob Parker told reporters.	
 ""To our people in Christchurch, around New Zealand and
around the world...you need to steel yourselves for these
numbers to increase probably, in the days ahead."" 
 The dead include people from 20 nations, including dozens of
students from Japan, China, India and Taiwan who were in
Christchurch, one of New Zealand's most attractive cities, to
learn English in view of the country's dramatic southern alps.	
 
 Hopes of finding people alive five days after the quake were
dimmed by aftershocks of up to magnitude 4.4 which brought down
masonry and sent rescue teams scrambling for safety.	
 No further survivors have been found since a woman was
rescued mid-afternoon on Wednesday. 
 The number of missing was still reported at more than 200,
but police have said it is likely that the number includes
recovered bodies that have yet to be identified.	
 In the central city, the search has concentrated on a
finance company office block, the city's landmark cathedral and
a local television building, which housed an English language
school, but aftershocks were hampering efforts.	
 ""Work did have to stop there temporarily during the period
of falling masonry,"" said police commander Dave Cliff.	
 More than half of the dead have come from the ruins of the
Canterbury Television (CTV) building. About 65 people, including
many missing Japanese and Chinese students, are believed to be
inside, caught as floors pancaked down on one another. 
 ""We're systematically removing layer upon layer of the
debris. We're looking for voids in locations where we might find
survivors...regrettably over recent times we've only been
encountering the deceased,"" said fire rescue commander Jim
Stuart Black. 
 More than 600 rescue workers scoured the city and
hardest-hit suburbs, where broken water and sewage pipes,
toppled power lines and ruptured gas mains have made large areas
uninhabitable, forcing thousands to flee.	
 Parker, the local mayor, said more than 340 houses in city's
eastern suburbs, near the epicentre, had been marked with red
tape for demolition, while around 40 percent of buildings in the
city centre were unsafe to enter.	
 Thousands of volunteers from unaffected parts of the city or
nearby towns converged on the worst-affected areas, where the
quake forced up sand and water through roads and gardens. They
shovelled sun-baked, grey sand contaminated with sewage and
debris into metre high piles for removal.	
 Christchurch is built on shaky foundations of sand, silt and
subterranean water which all churned together during the quake.	
 ""We got off lightly. What can we do but help folk like us
who didn't fare so well?"" said Ngaire Smith.	
 More than 300 Australian police arrived in the city on
Friday, boosting the number of police to around 1,200, which
police chief Cliff said would allow ""assurance and security""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc may extend its
rally next week as tensions in Libya and fears of contagion
prompt investors to seek safety, while the U.S. dollar's fate
could hinge on the monthly U.S. jobs report.
 The Swiss currency on Friday posted its biggest two-week
advance against the dollar in eight months as investors feared
the uprising in Libya could spread to other oil-producing
countries. A spike in energy prices could hurt U.S. consumer
spending and crimp global economic growth.
 ""So far the situation remains fluid. It doesn't look like
it's going away anytime soon. So as long as it persists, the
Swiss franc should benefit,"" said Mary Nicola, currency
strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 U.S. jobs data for February, due next Friday, will also be
a major focus for investors. Economists polled by Reuters are
expecting an increase of 178,000 jobs, up sharply from a meager
36,000 gain in January. [ECI/US]
 A better-than-expected jobs report could boost optimism
about the labor market, which has been a weak spot in the
economic recovery, and benefit the dollar.
 The dollar fell 4.7 percent against the Swiss franc over
the last two weeks, the largest decline since late June. It
earlier hit a record low of 0.9229  on trading
platform EBS, before recovering to last trade at 0.9284, up 0.3
percent.
 The euro last traded at 1.2767 Swiss francs ,
down 0.1 percent on the day and off 1.3 percent this week.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies to Congress on Tuesday
and Wednesday, and analysts think he is unlikely to suggest
much appetite within the central bank for scaling back a $600
billion government bond-buying program launched in November.
 ""Fed Chairman Bernanke will likely repeat the logic
underlying the Fed's comfort in his semi-annual testimony to
Congress this week. It is a stance that will continue to
undermine the USD relative to its more hawkish peers
elsewhere,"" said Daragh Maher, deputy head of global FX
strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in London.
 HAWKISH ECB?
 The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest
rates at a record low of 1 percent next week. Investors will
closely monitor comments by ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet for
clues about the outlook for monetary policy.
 Recent inflation-fighting rhetoric from Bank officials have
boosted expectations euro zone interest rates will rise more
quickly than those in the United States.
 ""With inflation rising, that could be a main concern, so we
could see them pick up their hawkish rhetoric,"" BNP Paribas'
Nicola said.
 The latest positioning data showed currency speculators
boosted bets in favor of the euro in the latest week to the
highest since October. They also increased long positions in
the Swiss franc. [IMM/FX]
 The euro last traded down 0.4 percent at $1.3743 ,
reversing earlier gains that had taken it to $1.3839, to the
highest level against the dollar in more than three weeks.
 The next upside target lies around $1.3862, this year's
high. A break above could see the euro rise toward the $1.3950
area, the 200-week moving average, followed by strong
resistance at the $1.40 level.
 The dollar rebounded on Friday, helped by a retreat in oil
prices after Saudi Arabia stepped up crude supply. The inverse
relationship between the greenback and oil has strengthened
this week.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.3 percent
to 77.281 <.DXY>, after earlier hitting a low of 76.945.
 Higher oil prices and expectations the Fed will lag other
major central banks in tightening hit the dollar this week,
sparking speculation the greenback has lost its safe-haven role
despite tensions in the Middle East and Africa.
 But Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital
Markets in London, said risk appetite is playing ""second
fiddle"" to interest rate expectations.
 To suggest that the U.S. currency has lost its safe-haven
role, he added, ""overlooks the upside risks to the dollar if
unrest in the Middle East continues to spread beyond a small
number of hot spots and hence spills over into a deeper and
more broadly based sell-off in risky assets.""

 * Yes vote seen key in sustaining economic recovery
 * Poll shows majority of voters back deal
(Adds latest poll, detail)
 REYKJAVIK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Icelanders will vote on April
9 on a plan to repay around $5 billion to Britain and the
Netherlands to cover debts from the financial crisis, with
popular backing key to keeping an economic recovery on track.
 Iceland's president triggered a referendum when he refused
this month to sign a bill setting out the terms of repayment
that had been approved by parliament.
 It was the second time he had vetoed a bill on the issue and
Icelanders rejected an earlier deal after a referendum in March
2010.
 ""The interior minister informed the cabinet this morning
that he had decided the referendum will be held on April 9,"" the
government said in a statement.
 Britain and the Netherland's want the cash to cover payments
they made to savers who lost money when Icelandic bank
Landsbanki collapsed in late 2008.
 The government says the new deal has much better terms than
the old, and is keen to get a deal done. But many Icelanders
still believe it is unfair that taxpayers must foot the bill for
mistakes made by private banks.
 A Frettabladid/Channel 2 poll published on Friday showed 61
percent of Icelanders who had made up their minds planned to
vote ""yes"" in the referendum, while 39 percent opposed the deal.
 The poll of 800 voters also showed 30 percent remained
undecided. An MMR poll, carried out Feb. 20-21, showed 58
percent in favour of the bill and 42 percent opposed.
 Iceland's financial system collapsed in late 2008 when all
its main banks folded in the global credit crunch. The island's
currency dived and the economy went into a tailspin.
 Output is seen expanding this year for the first time for
two years, inflation is under control and the central bank has
eased its core lending rate to 4.25 percent from a peak of 18
percent.
 An agreement over Icesave, however, is seen as vital to
further economic rehabilitation, particularly the removal of
capital controls, put in place at the height of the crisis.
 The Ministry of Economic Affairs said on Friday the Central
Bank would deliver its proposals for removing capital controls
next week. 
 ""It is expected that the cabinet will make a decision on the
plan no later than 11 March and that the approved plan will be
published the same afternoon,"" the ministry said in a statement.
 Earlier this week, ratings agency Moody's said Iceland's
sovereign debt rating could be downgraded if its voters rejected
the new agreement, while a ""yes"" vote was likely to result in a
raised outlook on the current Baa3 rating.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Global stocks bounced off a
week-long sell-off on Friday but oil prices edged higher even
after Saudi Arabia boosted oil output to calm fears of supply
disruptions sparked by the uprising in Libya.
 The Swiss franc headed for its biggest two-week advance
against the dollar in eight months and looked set to extend
gains as lingering fears of contagion from unrest in Libya
drove investors to safe-haven assets.
 ""The situation remains fluid. Everything still is up in the
air,"" said Mary Nicola, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in
New York. ""As long as it persists, the Swiss franc should
benefit.""
 Gold and bond prices also gained, reflecting concerns that
violence could spill over to other oil-producing countries in
the Middle East and crimp global economic growth.
 Oil was off Thursday's peak of almost $120 a barrel for
Brent futures, a level last seen in 2008, but a late bout of
buying to cover short positions lifted prices for the day.
 ""I don't think many traders are comfortable being short
over the weekend,"" said Tom Bentz, a broker at Paribas
Commodity Futures in New York.
 Saudi Arabia raised production about 8 percent to above 9
million barrels per day to make up for a near halt in Libyan
exports, an industry source said, helping prices fall from
peaks last seen in 2008. For details see [ID:nLDE71O1KA]
 The Saudi move bolstered optimism that U.S. consumer
sentiment rose to its highest level in three years in February,
helping offset a report that showed the U.S. economy grew more
slowly than initially estimated in the fourth quarter.
[ID:nN25299682] [ID:nN25247775]
 The U.S. dollar rebounded against the euro but gold prices
rose toward $1,410 an ounce and were on track for a fourth
straight week of gains, supported by safe-haven demand.
 The euro  was down 0.44 percent at $1.3742, while
spot gold prices  rose $8.87 to $1,408.60 an ounce.
 Consumer sentiment rose to 77.5, up from 74.2 in January,
and the highest since January 2008, according to the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan survey.
 Gross domestic product was revised lower to an annualized
rate of 2.8 percent from an initial 3.2 percent estimate.
 The potential spillover of unrest to other oil-producing
counties remained a concern, with trading in oil futures
volatile, considering outages in Libya have risen as high as
three-quarters of its 1.6 million barrels per day output.
 Government forces shot dead two protesters in the Libyan
capital Tripoli, Al Jazeera television reported, as a popular
uprising against Muammar Gaddafi closed in on his main power
base. [ID:nLDE71O00I]
 Still, investors took comfort in Saudi efforts to cover any
supply gaps.
 ""Fears that the unrest in Libya could turn into a civil war
and wipe out its oil production have been offset by assurances
from Saudi Arabia that it is raising output,"" said Gene
McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 ICE Brent crude futures  in London were up 69 cents
at $112.05 after briefly trading negative on the day. U.S.
light sweet crude oil  rose 86 cents to $98.14.

 NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc headed for its
biggest two-week advance against the dollar in eight months on
Friday and looked set to extend gains as turmoil in Libya and
fears of contagion drove investors to safe-haven assets.
 The U.S. dollar rebounded against the euro and other
currencies, helped by a retreat in oil prices after Saudi
Arabia stepped up crude supply. The inverse relationship
between the greenback and oil has strengthened this week.
 Uncertainty over the situation in the Middle East and
Africa remains high as investors fear the uprising in Libya

 Investors' attention now turns to next Friday's key U.S.
jobs report. Economists polled by Reuters are looking for an
increase of 175,000 jobs for February, up sharply from a meager
36,000 gain for the prior month.

 HAWKISH ECB?
 The euro last traded down 0.4 percent at $1.3744, reversing
earlier gains that had taken it $1.3839, to the highest level
against the dollar in more than three weeks.
 Traders said a weekly euro close above this year's highs at
$1.3862, hit in early February, leaves the single currency
poised for further gains toward $1.40. This level was viewed as
strong resistance, with traders reporting Asian central bank
offers defending an option barrier at the $1.3840-50 area.
 The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest
rates at a record low of 1 percent next week. Investors will
closely monitor comments by ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet for
clues about the outlook for monetary policy.
 ""With inflation rising, that could be a main concern, so we

 Recent inflation-fighting rhetoric from European Central

 That, combined with higher oil prices, pressured the dollar
this week, sparking speculation the greenback has lost its
safe-haven role despite tensions in the Middle East and Africa.
 But Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital

 ""Rising crude price, combined with ever more ECB talk of
guarding against second-round effects have led markets to price
in much earlier and more aggressive ECB hikes,"" Cole said.
 To suggest that the U.S. currency has lost its safe-haven
role, he added, ""overlooks the upside risks to the dollar if
unrest in the Middle East continues to spread beyond a small
number of hot spots and hence spills over into a deeper and
more broadly-based sell-off in risky assets.""
 The U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low versus the
Canadian dollar at C$0.9797, helped by elevated oil prices and
as traders took out an option barrier at C$0.9800.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Equity markets rallied after a
week-long selloff, and crude oil prices edged higher on Friday
but were down from peaks earlier in the week on supply fears
sparked by the uprising in Libya.
 Saudi Arabia raised production about 8 percent to above 9
million barrels per day to make up for a near halt in Libyan
exports, an industry source said, helping prices fall further
from peaks last seen in 2008. For details see:[ID:nLDE71O1KA]
 ""The tensions in the Middle East seem to be less at the
forefront of the market's mind. The initial panic seems to have
subsided a bit,"" said Phil Gillett, a trader at Spreadex.
 The Saudi move bolstered news that U.S. consumer sentiment
rose to its highest level in three years in February, helping
offset a bearish report that showed the U.S. economy grew
slower than initially estimated in the fourth quarter.
[ID:nN25299682] [ID:nN25247775]
 The U.S. dollar rebounded against the euro but gold prices
rose toward $1,410 an ounce and were on track for a fourth
straight week of gains, supported by safe-haven demand in light
of fears violence in Libya could spread in the region.
 The euro  was down 0.37 percent at $1.3752.
 Consumer sentiment rose to 77.5, up from 74.2 in January,
and the highest since January 2008, according to the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan survey.
 Gross domestic product was revised lower to an annualized
rate of 2.8 percent from an initial 3.2 percent estimate.
 Events in North Africa and the Middle East still grabbed
the spotlight even as oil prices retreated from 2-1/2 year
peaks of almost $120 a barrel in London on Thursday to hover at
less than $112 on Saudi efforts to plug any supply gaps.
[ID:nLDE71N13Q]
 ""We have started producing over 9 million barrels per day.
We have a lot of production capacity,"" the industry source told
Reuters.
 ICE Brent crude futures  in London were up 13 cents
at $111.49 after briefly trading negative on the day. U.S.
light sweet crude oil  rose 26 cents to $97.52.
 Stocks in Europe rose, with the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top European shares closing up 1.2 percent.
 World equities as measured by MSCI's all-country world
index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose almost 0.8 percent.
 ""We got a little bit oversold in a very short period of
time this week so it's normal to get this kind of a rebound,""
said James Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy
Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
 ""The market is likely to bounce a little more, but not too
much since there is still more to the downside after such a
strong rally and ongoing geopolitical concerns.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 44.84
points, or 0.37 percent, at 12,113.34. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 9.64 points, or 0.74 percent, at
1,315.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 32.84
points, or 1.20 percent, at 2,770.74.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose as turmoil in North Africa
and worries over the economic impact of higher oil prices
maintained a safe-haven bid for government debt.
[ID:nN25406662]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
5/32 in price to yield 3.43 percent.
 German bond prices fell as oil prices retreated and after
an Italian auction of 9.5 billion euros worth of debt attracted
decent demand.
 The Bund future  was last down 15 ticks down on the
day at 124.26.
 Gold prices rose above $1,400 an ounce and were on track
for a fourth straight week of gains, supported by interest in
the metal as a haven from risk as violence flared in Libya.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded against
the euro on Friday, boosted by a retreat in oil prices after
Saudi Arabia stepped up crude supply, and the greenback could
reclaim its status as a safe-haven currency if Middle East
tensions escalate.
 The correlation between lower oil prices and a higher
dollar may be in place for now, but some analysts said that
link could weaken. Although the dollar failed earlier this week
to hold its traditional role as a safe-haven currency as the
uprising in Libya stoked fears about unrest spreading to other
oil producers, traders said the dollar could reclaim safe-haven
status even if oil spikes anew.
 In midday New York trade, the euro was down 0.4 percent on
the day at $1.3754. It hit session lows at $1.3724, reversing
earlier gains that had taken it to the highest level against
the dollar in more than three weeks.
 The euro's early session strength was helped by
inflation-fighting rhetoric from European Central Bank policy
makers, which added to expectations that euro zone rates will
rise faster than those in the United States.
 A weekly euro close above this year's highs at $1.3862, hit
in early February, leaves the single currency poised for
further gains toward $1.40. This level was viewed as strong
resistance, with traders reporting Asian central bank offers
defending an option barrier at the $1.3840-50 area.
 ""The fact that oil prices came off their highs was a slight
benefit to the dollar,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. ""The oil-dollar
correlation seems intact for now, but I don't know for how
long.""
 Higher oil prices typically undermine the dollar as the
United States is a major oil importer.
 If the civil uprising in Libya worsens or unrest spreads to
other parts of the Middle East, the dollar could revert to
being a safe-haven currency even if oil spikes anew, McCarthy
said.
 Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia said it was willing to step
in to make up for any shortages resulting from tensions in
Libya, pushing oil prices lower. U.S. crude futures on Friday
were down at $96.96 per barrel, coming off their highs in more
than two years.
 Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy, at RBC Capital
Markets in London said the dollar's failure to rally in the
face of rising tension in the Middle East does not reflect a
change in the greenback's safe-haven status.
 Risk appetite is playing ""second fiddle"" to interest rate
expectations, Cole said.
 ""Rising crude price, combined with ever more ECB talk of
guarding against second-round effects have led markets to price
in much earlier and more aggressive ECB hikes,"" said Cole.
 To suggest that the U.S. currency has lost its safe-haven
role, he added, ""overlooks the upside risks to the dollar if
unrest in the Middle East continues to spread beyond a small
number of hot spots and hence spills over into a deeper and
more broadly-based sell-off in risky assets.""
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent against the Swiss franc at
0.9290 franc, after hitting a record low of 0.9229 franc on
Thursday. Analysts said the franc may face some liquidation of
longs, especially if oil prices stabilize.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.3
percent at 77.284, not far from a 3-1/2-month low of 76.881.
The euro is the largest component of the dollar index.
 Analysts said the euro's intraday-bias remained on the
upside. Minor support was cited at $1.3704, Thursday's low.
Below $1.3704, the euro's bias could switch to the downside for
a slide to $1.3427, this week's low, or possibly lower.
 A break past $1.3862 would mark its highest level since
early November. Beyond there, resistance lies at $1.3947, the
76.4 percent retracement of a November to January slide.
 The U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low versus the
Canadian dollar at C$0.9797, helped by elevated oil prices and
as traders took out an option barrier at C$0.9800.

 * Stock-piling an option, not best solution
 * EU legislation is punitive
 
 By Sue Thomas
 LNODON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Europe's supply of rare earth
elements and minor metals is being squeezed by China's grip on
these vital resources as well as by stringent EU legislation, a
main member of the Minor Metals Trade Association said.
 China produces about 97 percent of the global supply of the
minerals used in smartphones, electric car motors and high-tech
industrial equipment. It cut export quotas by 40 percent last
year, alarming buyers and angering trading partners.
 Last week it announced a shake-up of its rare earths
industry, vowing what it termed as ""reasonable"" quotas on mining
and exports to bring order to the sector, protect the
environment, prevent illegal mining and conserve its own
resources.
 Charles Swindon, chairman of the trade and lobby committee
of the MMTA, the world's largest association involved with minor
metals, is not convinced that China will soften its stance and
says that Western countries now face a crunch.
 ""The situation in the short term is very critical,"" he told
Reuters in an interview.
 ""I think that there is no change in China's attitude,"" he
added. ""I would say they are hardline, and we will have to wait
and see if economic factors alone might change this policy, but
I somehow doubt it.""
 China's exports of rare earth elements fell by almost
one-tenth last year, but the overall value rocketed as the quota
cuts lifted international prices.
 
 ANGER
 The export restraints have angered major trading partners
including the United States, European Union and Japan. The U.S.
Trade Representative office threatened last month to take China
to the World Trade Organisation.
 In a strategy document last month, the European Commission
said it would confront any country that restricted supplies of
raw materials and hinted at stockpiling.
 Swindon said while stockpiling strategic metals was an
option, it was not the best long-term solution. A two-pronged
approach of recycling and diplomacy was the way forward, he
said.
 ""I think recycling would take a much great burden from the
need to import so much from the east,"" he said.
 ""And I think some of the initiatives being taken up at the
EU in terms of having a common policy for dealing with this
would bring greater economic benefit, and it will be far
cheaper.""
 But at the same time, EU chemical regulations --
registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of
chemicals (REACH) -- are tightening the screws on the already
squeezed market.
 Under the legislation, companies that aim to trade titanium
must pay import duties of 5 percent to bring the material out of
bonded warehouses and are also required to buy a letter of
access for 70,000 pounds each time, Anthony Lipman, also a
former MMTA chairman, told a UK House of Commons committee last
week.
 ""I certainly believe the REACH legislation is having a
punitive effect in the UK and Europe,"" Swindon said. 
 ""There is a risk people will no longer be able to
participate in the free trade and supply of these metals to
manufacturing companies. I think the effects of this are only
starting to hit, and it is a worry.""

 By Andrey Ostroukh
 MOSCOW, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Boosted by high oil prices, the
rouble logged its strongest level versus the dollar since
November 2009 on Friday after the central bank raised all of its
key interest rates to fight accelerating inflation.
 The bank increased its key deposit, repo and refinancing
rates by 25 basis points to 3.00, 5.25 and 8.00 percent
respectively. It also raised reserve requirements.
 The extent of monetary tightening caught the market by
surprise as the majority of players had been expecting the
central bank to raise only the deposit rate.
 The move came a day after Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin
said it was time to raise rates to tame high inflation.
 ""The central bank's determination in fighting inflation ...
makes the Russian currency more attractive for investors,"" said
Igor Zelentsov, chief trader at Globex bank.
 Concerned by the prospect that strong oil prices and higher
interest rates will fuel speculative capital inflows into
Russian assets, the central bank also increased reserve
requirements for liabilities to non-residents by 100 basis
points.
 But the market focused on the higher rates, which increase
the rouble's yields, propping up demand for Russia's assets.
 ""The market had not foreseen such a decision and the rouble
has immediately firmed,"" said Anton Nikitin, an analyst with
Renaissance Capital.
 Versus the dollar, the rouble appreciated 7 kopecks to 28.94
after briefly touching its strongest level since Nov 2009 at
28.90. Against the euro, the rouble firmed 16 kopecks to 39.81.
 Against the euro-dollar basket, used by the central bank to
monitor exchange rates, the rouble added 11 kopecks to 33.83.
 Oil prices supported the rouble, surging in the wake of the
turmoil in oil-producing Libya, with Brent futures trading
around $111 per barrel on Friday.
 Russia's first rouble Eurobond issued this week also boosted
capital inflows and underpinned the rouble.
 However, the rouble's rally was slowed down by the central
bank that kept on purchasing foreign currencies to avoid
excessive firming of the Russian unit, dealers said.
 ""The central bank's interventions of around $350 million a
day were not enough to absorb the amount of foreign currencies
that was sold yesterday after the Eurobond placement,"" said
Denis Korshilov, chief dealer at Citi bank in Moscow.
 Additionally, tax payments falling due at the end of the
month helped the rouble to hover near multi-months highs as
export-focused companies were seen converting dollars to meet
local liabilities, said Korshilov.
 Analysts at Trust bank forecast that mineral tax and excise
duty payments due by Monday will total up to 190 billion roubles
($6.57 billion).

 NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded against
the euro on Friday, boosted by a retreat in oil prices after
Saudi Arabia stepped up crude supply, with the currency
possibly attracting more flows if Middle East tensions
escalate.
 The lower oil-higher dollar correlation may be in place for
now, but some analysts said the link could weaken and the
greenback could rise if the situation in the Middle East gets
out of control.
 In mid-morning New York trade, the euro  was down
0.5 percent on the day at $1.3737. It hit session lows. at
$1.3720, reversing earlier gains which took it to the highest
against the dollar in more than three weeks.
 The euro's early session strength was helped by

spreads to other parts of the Middle East, the ING trader said
the dollar could revert back to its traditional role as a

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 10:00AM ET</span>",FX loans hamstrung Hungary monetary policy-regulator," * Broader economy would benefit from weaker EUR/HUF -Szasz
 * Says interest rate rises not necessarily effective
 * Policy makers in a deadlock due to FX borrowing
 
 BUDAPEST, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Unbridled foreign currency
borrowing by households had hamstrung Hungarian monetary policy
by curbing its impact on money supply and forcing the central
bank into maintaining a stable forint, a top regulator said.
Hungarians ran up trillions of forints worth of foreign
currency debt during the boom years, mainly in the volatile
Swiss franc, to take advantage of lower interest rates but now
many struggle with repayments due to the franc's strength.
 Karoly Szasz, head of financial markets regulator PSZAF said
on Friday that the proliferation of these loans had rendered
monetary policy ineffective as the central bank had to focus on
maintaining the stability of the Hungarian forint.
 ""The stock of foreign currency loans has grown to such a
scale that it has nearly rendered monetary policy, and economic
policy unmanageable,"" Szasz told a European Union budgetary
affairs conference in Budapest.
 
 The centre-right government, which took office in May, had
since banned foreign currency lending and is working on a
solution to help underwater mortgage holders.
 Most Swiss franc denominated loans were taken out at around
150-160 forints per franc  versus recent levels above
210.
 ""With a foreign currency loan stock of this size, changing
forint interest rates does not necessarily reach the objective
intended by the Monetary Council (of the central bank),"" Szasz
said.
 ""An increase in the interest rate will not necessarily
reduce money supply if, by way of foreign currency loans,
additional funds are channelled into the economy, which can then
be converted into forints,"" he said.
 Szasz said higher forint interest rates did not necessarily
restrict credit demand either, as they had no impact on demand
for foreign currency debt.
 That put Hungarian policy makers in a deadlock, as even
though the broader economy would benefit from a weaker forint,
such levels would be disastrous for household borrowers.
 ""A weaker forint/euro exchange rate could stimulate
Hungarian exports, increase our competitiveness and boost
employment and would therefore be desirable from the aspect of
the economy,"" Szasz said.
 ""On the other hand, taking the magnitude of foreign currency
loans into account, as well as the negative impact of a weaker
forint exchange rate on the burden of foreign currency
borrowers, this is simply unmanageable.""
 The central bank left interest rates on hold at 6 percent
 on Monday after three quarter point rate rises in the
previous three months to combat inflation pressures. The bank
has repeatedly said it had no exchange rate target.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 09:44AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Belarus leader urges tighter forex controls," * Says currency should not be sold freely
 * Belarussian rouble under pressure to devalue
 
 (Adds quotes, background)
 MINSK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko urged the government and the central bank on Friday
to tighten control over the flows of foreign currency saying it
would ease pressure on the Belarussian rouble .
 The former Soviet republic's currency has come under
pressure after the government boosted spending and lending last
year in the run-up to the presidential election in which
Lukashenko secured his fourth term in office.
 ""We are too relaxed about the way foreign currency revenues
are used,"" he told a government meeting, according to the state
news agency BelTA.
 ""A few hundred or a few dozen of key companies are bringing
foreign currency into the country and the prime minister and the
central bank chairman, guided by strange free market theories,
are handing out this currency left and right. Anyone can go to
the exchange and buy as much as he wants.""
 The Belarussian central bank's reserves shrank by over $600
million in 2010 and by $650 million last month alone. The
reserves stood at $4.3 billion at the end of January.
 Belarus' current account deficit reached 16 percent of gross
domestic product last year, according to IMF estimates, and is
unlikely to decrease significantly this year.
 The IMF has advised Belarus to tighten its monetary policy to reduce the current account gap. But the central bank has
since said it saw no need to raise rates. [ID:nLDE71G0JZ]
 Instead, Belarus increased forex trading fees 200 times last
month. On Friday, Lukashenko called for further tightening but
provided no details.
 ""Order must be restored here... We will have no problems
with the exchange rate then,"" he said.
 The central bank has said that the rouble exchange rate this
year will not rise or fall more than 8 percent against a basket
of three currencies: the dollar, the euro and the Russian
rouble.
 The basket's base rate for this year is 1,054.68 roubles to
basket.
 In January, the Belarussian rouble fell 2.6 percent against
the basket. It traded at 3,020 roubles per dollar on Friday
while the rate against the basket was 1,095.17 roubles.
 Several ex-Soviet republics, such as Uzbekistan and
Turkmenistan, have in the past restricted or continue to
restrict forex trading to ease the pressure on central bank
reserves and exert tighter control over the economy.
 This led to the emergence of two separate exchange rates:
the official rate, at which only a few chosen players could buy
foreign currency, and the ""black market"" rate used by everyone
else.

 * EU taking ""more and more action"" on Chinese state aid
 * EU firms fear Chinese retaliation on subsidy claims
 
 By Terhi Kinnunen
 HELSINKI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The European Union will take
further action against Chinese state subsidies that hurt
European interests, but regulators need European whistleblowers
to help them succeed, the EU's trade chief said on Friday.
 ""We have come to the conclusion in the European Commission
that the real problem with China is subsidisation,"" EU Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht told reporters while visiting
Finland. ""We are taking more and more action in that respect.""
 But EU trade officials rely on EU firms to provide evidence
that aid and financing programmes give advantages to their
Chinese rivals -- and many EU firms operating in China are
reluctant to do so for fear of retaliation, De Gucht said.
 ""The big problem with subsidisation is that we need proof.
We cannot start a case against a country... if we have
(insufficient) proof. And that proof has to come from the
companies,"" he said.
 ""A lot of companies are ready to say off the record this is
unacceptable, do something about it, but afraid of coming out
and saying this publicly.""
 The legality of Chinese state subsidies is coming under
increased investigation by the EU, particularly as Chinese
production encroaches on sectors in which the EU has
traditionally been strong, such as cars and telecoms networks.
 That focus has heightened tensions between the EU and China.
China denies its industrial programmes are illegal and is
fighting at the World Trade Organization for its right to
continue them.
 De Gucht said the EU would press ahead despite the tensions.
 The European Commission recently cited ""massive"" state aid
for China's telecoms firms as an example of illegal support.
 But subsidies are not limited to that sector, De Gucht said.
 Chinese subsidies pose a problem to the EU ""not only in
telecom, but in all sectors,"" he said.
 It has also proposed the EU's first anti-subsidy tariff
against China over support for glossy paper manufacturers. If
approved by EU states next month, the duties could set a
precedent for similar cases, EU diplomats say. 
 ""China is rather upset about it, but we are going to
continue with that,"" De Gucht said.

 * At least 20 mln barrels of Iran crude in floating storage
 * European refiner Saras confirms taking more Iranian crude
 
 By Parisa Hafezi and Christopher Johnson
 TEHRAN/LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Iran is taking advantage
of Libya's turmoil and dwindling exports to sell more crude that
it has found difficult to offload due to economic sanctions.
 Unrest in Libya has slashed a big chunk of its crude oil
output of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd), with estimates of
capacity shut down ranging from 500,000 to 1.2 million bpd.
 Ahmad Ghalebani, Iranian deputy oil minister, said on Friday
Iran had already seen an increase in demand following political
upheaval in the Arab world.
 ""Demand for Iran's oil has increased,"" Iran's semi-official
Mehr news agency quoted Ghalebani as saying.
 Italian oil refiner Saras SpA, traditionally a big buyer of
Libyan crude oil, said in a Reuters interview on Friday that it
was looking at replacing oil shipments from Libya and had
already slightly increased sour crude supplies from Iran.
 Saras General Manager Dario Scaffardi said his company was
also looking at Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, West Africa, Algeria and
the North Sea for possible crude replacements for Libyan oil.
 The United States has led a drive to isolate Iran through
international sanctions and bring it to the negotiating table
over its nuclear programme.
 The sanctions have targeted payments to Iran via the
financial system, and this has made it more difficult for Iran
to sell its crude abroad, forcing it to store large volumes of
its oil at sea in very large crude carriers (VLCCs).
 
 OFFSHORE
 Many international oil companies are unwilling or unable to
take Iranian oil, but others are less constrained, particularly
in Europe and Asia.
 Analysts say Iran is well placed to take advantage of the
reduction in Libyan oil exports.
 Although Libyan crude is typically high quality with
relatively small amounts of corrosive sulphur compounds and
Iranian crude is typically lower quality, Iranian oil is readily
available and near to key European markets.
 Iran has been storing large quantities of oil in tankers at
sea, some of them off its Kharg Island in the Middle East Gulf
and some of it in the Mediterranean.
 Ship brokers and agents say Iran has at least 20 million
barrels of crude, mostly Iranian Heavy, at sea in 10 VLCCs and
up to another 20 million barrels in shorter-term storage.
 ""The Iranians sell most of their oil on a landed basis,""
said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Centre for Global
Energy Studies in London.
 ""They store their oil offshore or bring it closer to their
clients. So the oil is already near their customers,"" Drollas
said. ""Something like this happens and suddenly - Bingo!""
A source at the Iranian oil ministry told Reuters Iran
planned to divert some cargoes to Italy and other countries.
 Asked about sanctions, the source said: ""This is not a time
to be talking about sanctions. The world needs our oil and we
are ready to step in just like any other OPEC member country.""
 Iran is unlikely to be able to increase oil production
significantly as a result of the higher demand and rise in oil
prices, which pushed the North Sea Brent futures benchmark to
around $112 per barrel on Friday.
 Ghalebani said Iran would respect its output target as part
of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 Iranian oil output in January was 3.64 million bpd,
according to Reuters' monthly survey of OPEC producers, down
from 3.67 million bpd in December and compared with an implied
OPEC target 3.34 million bpd.
 Drollas said Iran's output capacity may now be only around
3.75 million bpd and that he expected its output capacity to
fall towards 3.6 million bpd by the end of this year.

 * First fall in household spending since Q2 2009
 * Pound falls, rate futures rise after unexpected revision
 
 (Adds detail, comment)
 By Fiona Shaikh and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Britain's economy suffered an
even sharper slump than expected at the end of last year and
would have shrunk slightly even without December's bad weather,
official data showed on Friday.
 The figures dented market expectations of any early rise in
interest rates by the Bank of England, though analysts said a
May increase was still on the cards.
 Recent survey data suggest activity rebounded strongly early
this year, and the government said the drop -- much of which was
due to December's unusually severe weather -- would not throw
its deficit-busting programme off track.
 Friday's official data showed Britain's economy shrank by
0.6 percent between October and December, surprising analysts
who thought last month's preliminary estimate of a 0.5 percent
contraction would be unrevised.
Britain's Q4 performance looks dismal compared to its peers.
Germany's economy expanded by 0.4 percent over the period and
even France managed 0.3 percent growth. U.S. GDP figures on
Friday showed annualised fourth-quarter growth revised down to
2.8 percent from 3.2 percent.
 The weak UK data reinforce the case of those on the BoE's
Monetary Policy Committee who think it is premature to start
raising interest rates when the economy still faces severe
headwinds.
 Still, it is unlikely to break the momentum towards tighter
policy after minutes this week showed three out of nine MPC
members voted for an immediate rate rise from 0.5 percent in
February.
 The pound fell a third of a cent against the dollar and hit
a one-month low against the euro as investors scaled back bets
on a rise in interest rates in the next two months.
 ""Today's data will add to the concerns of the doves in the
MPC who maintain that the recovery is still fragile, and will
strengthen the case for a wait-and-see policy at least until it
has become clear that the recovery is sustainable,"" said Blerina
Uruci, economist at Barclays Capital.
 
 ON THE REBOUND?
 The Office for National Statistics stuck to its line that
December's bad weather accounted for 0.5 percentage points of
the fall in economic output, and it said the downgrade to GDP
was mainly due to lower production and services output than it
estimated last month.
 But most analysts reckon the economy will enjoy a rebound in
the first quarter of this year, as firms and consumers make up
for time lost at the end of last year. 
 Indeed, recent purchasing managers' surveys indicate
activity is picking up sharply, with manufacturers enjoying
particularly robust demand thanks to the past fall in the pound.
 Many analysts still expect the BoE to start raising rates in
May to tackle inflation, which is currently running at double
the central bank's 2 percent target.
 ""I think May is still on the cards,"" said Richard Barwell,
economist at RBS. ""This is one bad quarter and we think it will
come back in Q1.""
 
 BELT TIGHTENING
 Friday's data showed household spending fell 0.1 percent on
the quarter -- suggesting Britons were tightening their belts
even before a January rise in value added tax, and boding ill
for consumption once public sector spending cuts kick in.
 Surveys show consumer morale remains in the doldrums, and
stores have also been having a hard time, with retail bellwether
John Lewis on Friday reporting a fifth week of poor sales.
 A survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed
retail sales growth slowed to an 8-month low in February, and
looked set to deteriorate further.
 Britain's economic recovery looks set to be sluggish this
year as the government embarks on its deepest spending cuts in
generations to reduce a record budget deficit.
 Without government spending, which rose by 0.7 percent on
the quarter, the decline in Q4 GDP would have been even sharper.
 ""This is fairly worrying given we know about the wave of
fiscal austerity that is now starting to hit the UK economy,""
said James Knightley, economist at ING.
 And while policymakers will be dismayed by rising price
pressures -- the implied deflator shot up to 1.0 percent on the
quarter from 0.3 percent in Q3 2010 -- they will probably want
more reassurance that the recovery is back on track before
pulling the trigger on rates.
 ""There is no prospect of any moves before the Q1 data
becomes available at the end of April and even then a rate hike
is not the foregone conclusion that markets appear to think it
is,"" said Andrew Goodwin, economic adviser to the Ernst & Young
ITEM Club.

 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Financial markets -- and oil in
particular -- will doubtless be in thrall in the coming week to
Libya and whatever the wave of Middle East and North Africa
popular uprisings throws up next.
 But the radical change in the Arab world is not the only
question mark hanging over investors. Does anyone remember the
euro zone debt crisis?
 In the current, rather fragile market environment -- and
with euro zone leaders still unable to find a permanent aid
mechanism -- it might not take much to retrigger the kind of
frenzied peripheral bond sell-off seen last year.
 Indeed, although nowhere near their peaks of last year, euro
zone peripheral yield spreads over German debt have widened in
February. Italy has swelled by about 50 basis points and Spain
40 basis points.
Significantly, Portuguese five- and 10-year yields remain
above 7 percent, levels which previously forced bailouts in
Greece and Ireland.
 This suggests that a series of debt auctions in the week
ahead will be closely watched for what they say about confidence
in Europe's finances.
 Belgium, which has come under some pressure, auctions 2014,
2018 and 2021 bonds on Monday. Spain, one of the potential
hotspots, will auction five-year bonds on Thursday, and
investors will be particularly watching a Portuguese buy-back on
Wednesday for signs of a fire sale.
 The core is not excluded either. The Netherlands goes to
market on Tuesday, Germany on Wednesday and France on Thursday.
What may make these auctions more noteworthy than usual is
that they come in the run-up to a March 11 special euro zone
summit that is supposed to come to some agreement over what a
permanent debt management mechanism might look like.
 A meeting on Friday in Helsinki of centre-right euro zone
leaders -- expected to include Germany's Angela Merkel -- may
give some kind of flavour.
 The results of Ireland's general election and likely
coalition formation talks will also be scrutinised for what they
say about the bailed-out country's commitment to fiscal
austerity.
 The widening spreads, meanwhile, suggest investors are
getting a little impatient with euro zone leaders over how long
they are taking to come up with solid solutions to the problem.
Investors are looking for something concrete.
 ""The market response will be driven around whether it is
pain relief or cure,"" said David Shairp, global strategist for
JPMorgan Asset Management"".

 ALL BETS
 At the same time, all previous assumptions about the
performance of financial assets have taken a big hit from the
sharp rises in the price of oil brought on by the Libyan revolt
and uncertainty about how far it might spread.
 The events in the Middle East and North Africa are moving at
such a fast pace and with often surprising turns that investors
are pretty much forced not to take strong positions.
 That is one of the reasons that world stocks took a hit in
the past week following a remarkable run-up in January and early
February.
 Charts show some equity markets still have a way to fall
before they move out of the trend line they have developed since
it was clear last summer that the U.S. Federal Reserve was going
to pump liquidity into the market with quantative easing.
The price of oil, meanwhile, has been reaching levels that
analysts say can start hurting the global economy by crimping
growth. There are also fears that it will simply add to
inflation and push earlier tightening by central banks.
 ""In 2008, oil prices approached $150 per barrel. Shortly
afterwards, the global economy collapsed,"" HSBC Chief Economist
Stephen King wrote to clients.
 ""There were, of course, other problems at the time -- an
imploding U.S. housing market, the beginnings of a
securitisation crisis, the collapse of Lehman Brothers -- but
events three years ago nevertheless offer plenty of evidence
that substantial changes in oil prices are big news for the
global economy.""
 Around $120 a barrel appears to be the level at which
economists start to get twitchy. Some technical analysis is
suggesting that $160 is possible.
 This will be at least at the back of investors' minds when
they scan the other events of the coming week.
 They include interest rate meetings at the European Central
Bank and in Australia, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, and Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual congressional testimony.
 On the data front, meanwhile, there are global manufacturing
and services reports due, euro zone inflation data, and the
monthly U.S. employment numbers.
 So it is not all Libya.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 08:16AM ET</span>",BOE FOCUS-Tweaks to forecasting model won't calm critics," * New ""Compass"" model likely to be in place by year-end
 * Revamp of BoE forecasting process won't be radical
 * Shifts in policymakers' judgment bigger driver of change
 
 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - A revamp of the Bank of England's
core forecasting model looks set to be completed by the year-end
but those hoping for a fundamental change of approach will be
disappointed.
 Compass, as the new model is known, was conceived not as a
response to the bank's dismal forecasting record but as a way of
simplifying and streamlining its existing models.
 The BoE took the decision to build new software at the start
of 2008, before the credit crunch exposed the flaws of its
traditional forecasting tools. At that time, inflation had only
just peeped above target and the central bank's
inflation-fighting credentials remained intact.
 The BoE intends to run both models in parallel for a while
and hopes the shift from old to new will be so subtle members of
the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will not notice any
difference.
 For critics of the BoE's forecasting process, that is an
opportunity lost.
 The central bank's failure to foresee a surge in inflation
has taken a heavy toll on its reputation and left Britain
persistently with the highest inflation rate of Group of Seven
countries.
 Consumer price inflation has been above the BoE's 2 percent
target more than 80 percent of the time for the past three years
and gauges of future inflation show both households and
investors are questioning the bank's ability to bring it back
down.
 ""You might think the BoE would hold up their hands and look
at doing things differently, but that isn't the case,"" said
Simon Ward, chief economist at Henderson. ""This is more a
technical upgrade than an admission that their model was
lacking. It's wasted expenditure.""
 
 CLAMOUR OF CRITICISM
 Doubts about the central bank's forecasting ability have
come not just from independent economists but from within its
own ranks.
 Andrew Sentance, the most hawkish member of the MPC, has
been increasingly vocal in his criticism of the BoE's
forecasting process.
 The BoE's model, he claims, failed to capture the
inflationary impact of sterling's fall from mid-2007 and has
been over-reliant on measures of the output gap -- the level of
spare capacity that textbook theory dictates must to be used up
before inflation can take hold.
 In a small, open economy such as Britain's, Sentance
believes the domestic output gap is a largely irrelevant
concept. Commodity and oil prices are dictated by global demand
pressures, he argues, not domestic ones.
 ""This tendency to overweight the downward pull of spare
capacity in the UK economy and underweight the upward impact of
external inflationary pressures has resulted in big upside
inflation forecast errors,"" Sentance said last week in his most
outspoken attack yet. [ID:nLDE71G0RV]
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet --
sitting on inflation a little above two percent rather than the
five percent on some measures in the UK -- holds a similar view.
 Last month, he rejected core inflation, which strips out
factors like volatile energy prices, as a good predictor of
future price pressures. [ID:nLDE70M0GT]
Criticism of the BoE model has not been confined to those of
a hawkish disposition. At the other end of the spectrum,
arch-dove Adam Posen declared this week that he believed the
BoE's latest growth and inflation were both too optimistic.
 
 JUDGMENT KEY
 Although the bank insists its credibility rests with the
judgment of its nine monetary policymakers rather than the
model, it places a great deal of weight on the outcome of its
quarterly forecasting process.
 Since March 2009, all major policy decisions have coincided
with updated quarterly forecasts. Even before that, interest
rates were far more likely to be changed on months that
coincided with new forecasts -- February, May, August and
November -- than at other times.
 Both the new Compass model and the Bank of England Quarterly
Model, in use since 2004, are dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium models, to use the jargon.
 This is standard for central bank macro models and allows
policymakers to gauge the likely reaction to a series of
different events. For details click on
[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/other/beqm/index.htm] Although various simulations can be run of this sort of
model, policymakers can become unstuck if they assume previous
correlations will hold true.
 The amplifying effect of credit and financial market shocks
are also notoriously difficult to model, something highlighted
by the seizing up of credit markets after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008.
 Danny Gabay, whose Fathom Financial Consulting group uses an
exact replica of the Bank of England's forecasting model, says
the shift to the new model will do nothing to restore the BoE's
credibility -- it is the fundamental thinking that needs to
change.
 Like Sentance, he believes the BoE's most obvious mistake
was to downplay the impact of a 25 percent depreciation in the
value of sterling between mid-2007 and 2009 and the surge in
imported raw material costs that ensued.
 ""The BoE relied too heavily on the experience of the early
1990s when there were a lot of other influences pushing down on
inflation,"" he said.
Gabay does not think the BoE's forecasting errors have led
to monetary policy errors but thinks lessons need to be learned
about the limitations of models and the need to employ judgment
more finely when circumstances change.
""What has damaged the BoE's credibility, much more than a
period of high inflation, has been their inability to forecast
it,"" he said.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 08:04AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-German MPs to vote on debt crisis motion in mid-March," * Motion aims to rule out bond buybacks by ESM
 * High Court decision unlikely before second half of year
 * German economists speak out against expanding EFSF

(Adds economists in paras 4, 5)
 By Soeren Amelang
 BERLIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Germany's parliament will vote in
mid-March on a motion opposing most of potential solutions to
Europe's debt crisis, possibly tying Chancellor Angela Merkel's
hands ahead of a summit aimed at agreeing a deal.
 A keenly-awaited decision by Germany's highest court on the
efforts to stem the crisis, however, will probably not be made
before the second half of the year, legal experts and members of
parliament said.
 The parliamentary motion, put forward by ruling coalition
deputies this week, seeks to rule out bond buybacks by the euro
zone's permanent rescue fund after 2013 and takes a hardline
stance that could make it harder for Merkel to compromise with
her euro zone partners in next month's talks.
 Reflecting the depth of opposition in Germany to any deal
that makes it stump up for the fiscal policy failings of Greece,
Portugal and others, a group of 189 German economists published
an appeal to Merkel not to agree to bond-buying by the current
temporary bailout fund (EFSF) or the European Central Bank.
""That would endanger the reputation and the independence of
the ECB,"" the economists wrote in a joint statement, excerpts of
which were published in the Handelsblatt newspaper and
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily.
 The assumption that either the EFSF or the ECB would be
tasked with stepping in to buy sovereign bonds is seen as
central to any solution to the crisis and was the key to a
fragile recovery for Spanish and Portuguese debt last month.
 But concerns that domestic politics may make it impossible
for Merkel to commit to a package that would end the crisis has
prodded premiums respectively around 40 and 80 basis points
higher so far in February.
 The lower house of parliament said it will vote on the
motion on March 17, after a euro zone summit to thrash out a
deal on further steps in the crisis but before a full EU meeting
on March 24/25 that would approve the deal.
 
 BETWEEN SUMMITS
 The court verdict on efforts to block the rescue package for
Greece and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) may
also have an impact on the planned permanent bailout fund. A
ruling was originally expected in spring 2011.
 ""I expect a decision in the second half of the year,""
Michael Stuebgen, European policy spokesman in parliament for
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, told Reuters.
 Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider, an attorney who is a leading
eurosceptic in Germany and plaintiff in the case, said the
decision could even be delayed further. 
 ""It is quite well possible that a hearing will only take
place at the end of the year,"" he told Reuters. ""A ruling might
then be delayed until the beginning of next year.""
 The constitutional court could also decide to defer the case
to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to assess whether
the mechanisms constitute a breach of the European ""No Bailout""
clause in the European Treaty.
 Observers say this unprecedented step was quite possible in
this particular case but it was impossible to estimate how

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Friday,
helped as oil prices retreated from their recent highs on easing
concerns about the turmoil in Libya and as investors squared
positions ahead of the weekend.
 However, the euro still hovered near 2011 highs against the
U.S. currency, helped by inflation-fighting rhetoric from euro
zone policymakers which has added to expectations euro zone
rates will rise while U.S. policy remains loose.
 A weekly close above the early February high of $1.3862
would leave the euro well placed for further gains towards
$1.40, but this level was seen as strong resistance, with
traders reporting Asian central bank offers defending an option
barrier at $1.3840/50.
 ""The euro has held up fairly well in the context of events
in North Africa and this can only be pinned to the hawkish
commentary coming from the ECB,"" said Paul Mackel, currency
strategist at HSBC.
 The euro was down 0.15 percent on the day at $1.3784.
 A break past $1.3862 would mark its highest level since
early November. Beyond there, resistance lies at $1.3947, the
76.4 percent retracement of a November to January slide.
 Growing expectations for higher interest rates in the euro
zone while policy in the U.S. remains loose have supported the
euro, with European Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber saying
on Thursday the only direction for rates was up.
 Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, seen as a leading
candidate for the ECB presidency, also said in a newspaper
interview the bank would have to guarantee that inflation
expectations remain well anchored.
 But analysts said euro gains may be limited if the focus
switches back to euro zone fiscal problems, with investors also
wary as an election in Ireland got underway, which was expected
to result in defeat for the ruling party.
 ""The contrasting policy outlooks for Europe and the U.S.
have helped the euro and weighed on the dollar, and it wouldn't
be surprising to see the euro test the early February highs,""
said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.15
percent at 77.169, not far from a 3-1/2 month low of 76.881.
 
 SWISS FRANC, STERLING FALL
 The dollar was boosted when oil prices came off 2-1/2 year
highs after top exporter Saudi Arabia said it was willing to
step in to make up for any shortages resulting from tensions in
Libya.
 This also pushed the Swiss franc -- which has gained broadly
as investors sought safety as oil prices spiked -- off a record
high versus the dollar. 
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 0.9291 Swiss francs, having
hit a record low of 0.9229 francs in overnight trade.
 Market commentators said the franc may face some liquidation
of long positions, especially if oil prices stabilise.
 ""Short-term players may square some of their positions going
into the weekend and look to reassess the situation next week,""
said HSBC's Mackel.
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at 1.2800 francs, supported by a
buy euro, sell Swiss recommendation from Swiss bank UBS, whose
target for the pair was 1.3500.
 The Canadian dollar rose to a three-year high versus the
U.S. dollar at C$0.9797, helped by elevated oil prices and as
traders took out an option barrier at C$0.9800.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 07:24AM ET</span>",Elections won't distract euro zone talks -Germany," BERLIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Germany will pursue a
""comprehensive strategy"" in European talks in March to solve the
euro zone's sovereign debt crisis and not be distracted by
elections, a government spokesman said on Friday.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told a
government news conference that March was an ""eminently
important month"" for the euro zone, referring to decisions to be
finalised at a March 24-25 summit of European Union leaders.
 ""In general, what's at stake is truly a comprehensive
strategy based on objective considerations which must be made
independent of any upcoming elections or other decisions,""
Seibert said when asked about Friday's election in Ireland.
 Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), which were swept from
power in a regional election in Hamburg on Sunday, face the loss
of power in two more elections in March in Baden-Wuerttemberg
and Saxony-Anhalt. In a third state, Rhineland-Palatinate, the
CDU are in opposition and not expected to beat the Social
Democrats.
 Merkel has long been dragging her heels on agreeing to boost
the scope and size of the euro zone bailout fund, and fears of
further election defeats have added pressure for her not to
underwrite the debts of the zone's struggling periphery.
 Any perceived relaxation of debt terms for euro zone
stragglers is a sensitive subject in Germany. The centre-left
opposition accuses Merkel of taking a hardline position in
Europe due to the seven state elections this year.
 Germany has already said it will only agree new measures if
they come as part of a comprehensive package to solve the crisis
-- code for indebted states taking aggressive steps to among
other options cut back on public spending and cap wage growth.
 EU officials and diplomats have been working on options to
ease the terms on bailout loans to Ireland and Greece, increase
the effective lending capacity of the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) and let it buy euro zone sovereign
bonds or fund buy-backs by highly indebted countries.
 ""Germany's position is that March is an eminently important
month so that we come up with a comprehensive strategy with our
European partners,"" Seibert said. ""There's a lot on the table.""
 Earlier on Friday, a group of 189 German economists signed a
joint statement advising against increasing the capacity of the
euro zone's rescue fund and against the European Central Bank
buying euro zone sovereign debt bonds.
 ""That would endanger the reputation and the independence of
the ECB,"" the economists wrote in their communique, excerpts of
which were published in the Handelsblatt newspaper and
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily on Friday.
 The economists, led by Hamburg University economics
professor Bernd Lucke, formed their ""Plenum of Economists"" in
2010 in order to give their economic arguments more clout.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Oil fell from highs on Friday
after top exporter Saudi Arabia stepped up supplies, helping
push stocks up, although worries that dear oil may threaten
global growth kept those gains in check.
 Saudi Arabia has quietly increased its production after
unrest in Libya saw a large chunk of the North African nation's
output being cut. ICE Brent crude futures  were up at
$111.63 a barrel, retreating from $113.91 earlier in the day
while U.S. crude futures  rose to $97.75, but off highs.
 European stocks extended gains, taking a breather after a
week-long retreat, but sentiment was fragile. The FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.6 percent at
1,152.62 points, having lost over 3 percent over the past week.
 ""It's a relief rally as oil prices have come down, but
they're still high,"" said Richard Batty, investment director at
Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh.
 ""There remains a lot of uncertainty about developments in
the Middle East. You can't rule out the possibility of further
political change - and obviously that would have implications
for oil prices and financial markets. Higher oil prices would
check growth in Western economies.""
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open for Wall
Street on Friday, adding to a late rebound in the previous
session, with futures for the S&P 500  and the Dow Jones
industrial average  up 0.6 percent.
 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.36 percent, although it was off its
30-month high hit earlier this week.

 Even if oil markets stabilise, broader sentiment could
remain cautious as high fuel prices would add to inflationary
pressures and crimp consumer demand. That could threaten growth
in Asian economies, the drivers of a global recovery since the
2008 financial crisis hit output worldwide.
 Since the Libyan crisis erupted earlier this month, some of
the worst-performing markets within Asia are India, South Korea
and Taiwan due to their higher dependency on oil imports, Brown
Brothers Harriman said.
 Analysts reckon the degree of vulnerability for G-10 oil
importers is far less than that found in emerging economies.
 ""Our own analysis indicates that net oil imports for many
emerging economies in Asia are close to or greater than 5
percent of GDP,"" said Andrew Cox, G-10 strategist at Citi.
 
 OIL VOLATILE
 Estimates varied on how much of Libya's production is down
with the International Energy Agency pegging the volume shut at
500,000 to 750,000 bpd. Italian oil company ENI  said as
much as 1.2 million bpd may be down.
 Key Libyan oil terminals are under rebel control while
Muammar Gaddafi's forces have fought back against the rebellion

 Although oil prices have come off 2-1/2 year highs, they are
still up 12 percent in the past three sessions alone, leading to
worries about stagflation and lending support to safe-haven
assets such as gold, U.S. Treasuries and the Swiss franc.
 The dollar <.DXY> edged up as oil prices retreated from
their recent high, although expectations that the Federal
Reserve will lag behind the European Central Bank in raising
rates was unlikely to take it much higher.
 The euro  slipped to $1.3782, but was still eyeing
2011 highs against the dollar helped by more hawkish comments
from ECB officials. [ID:nWEB1519].

 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Friday,
helped as oil prices retreated from their recent highs on easing

 Ghosn added that he hoped for a decision within three years.
 Investors punished Renault SA shares after what the financial

catalyst to shore up its balance sheet through a planned change

 BERLIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - German MPs will vote in mid-March
on a motion that would rule out most of potential solutions to
Europe's debt crisis, possibly tying Chancellor Angela Merkel's
hands ahead of a summit aimed at agreeing a deal.
 A keenly-awaited decision by Germany's highest court on the
efforts to stem the crisis, however, will probably not be made
before the second half of the year, legal experts and members of
parliament said.
 The parliamentary motion put forward by ruling coalition
deputies this week seeks to rule out bond buybacks by the euro
zone's permanent rescue fund and takes a hardline stance that
could tie Chancellor Angela Merkel's hands against any
strengthening of the euro zone rescue fund. 
 The lower house of parliament said it will vote on the
motion on Friday, March 17, after a euro zone summit to thrash
out a deal on further steps in the crisis but before a full EU
meeting on March 24/25 that would approve the deal.
 The court ruling on efforts to block the rescue package for
Greece and the European Financial Stability Facilty (EFSF) may
also impact the planned permanent bailout fund. It was
originally expected in spring 2011.
 ""I expect a decision in the second half of the year,""
Michael Stuebgen, European policy spokesman in parliament for
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, told Reuters.
 Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider, an attorney who is a leading
eurosceptic in Germany and plaintiff in the case, said the
decision could even be delayed further. 
 ""It is quite well possible that a hearing will only take
place at the end of the year,"" he told Reuters. ""A ruling might
then be delayed until the beginning of next year.""
 The constitutional court could also decide to defer the case
to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to assess whether
the mechanisms constitute a breach of the European ""No Bailout""
clause in the European Treaty.
 Observers say this unprecedented step was quite possible in
this particular case but it was impossible to estimate how
likely that scenario is.
 The case would then go back to the German court for a final
decision. ""In that case, a ruling would be delayed for another
three years"", Schachtschneider predicted.

 ZURICH, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The brisk recovery of the Swiss
economy is set to pick up speed again after only a modest
slowdown despite the record strength of the Swiss franc, the
Swiss leading indicator, the KOF, showed on Friday.
 The reading ticked up unexpectedly to 2.18 in February from
an upwardly revised 2.16 in January, the KOF Swiss Economic
Institute said. The indicator bottomed in December after
declining since July 2010.
""The moderate downwards movement observed in the second half
of 2010 has been reversed,"" the KOF said. ""This indicates that
in the next months the present pace of growth of the Swiss
economy should gain a bit of momentum.""
 The median forecast in a Reuters poll was for the February
reading to slip to 2.08 from January's initial figure of 2.10.
 The Swiss National Bank expects economic growth to slow to
around 1.5 percent this year from an estimated 2.5 percent in
2010 as the strong franc has been taking its toll on the
export-oriented economy.
 However, SNB policymakers have sounded more sanguine over
the franc's impact recently and SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand
said the economy made a good start this year.
 The central bank is seen holding interest rates steady at

inflation is still very low and a rate increase would boost the

 * First fall in household spending since Q2 2009
 * Pound falls, rate futures rise after unexpected revision
 
 By Christina Fincher and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Britain's economy contracted even
faster than previously thought at the end of last year after the
first fall in household spending in 18 months, denting
expectations for an imminent rise in interest rates.
 Official data on Friday showed the economy shrank 0.6
percent between October and December, worse than an initial
estimate of a 0.5 percent decline and against analysts'
forecasts for an unchanged reading.
 Most of the decline was due to severe weather in December,
and the government said the figures would not throw its
deficit-busting programme off track. It noted that survey data
so far this year had ""exceeded expectations"".
 Nonetheless, the surprisingly weak data reinforce the case
of those on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee who
think it is premature to start raising interest rates when the
economy still faces severe headwinds.
 The pound fell a third of a cent against the dollar and hit
a one-month low against the euro as investors scaled back bets
on a rise in interest rates in the next two months.
 ""The slight downward revision might give the more hawkishly
inclined members of the MPC reason to pause for thought,"" said
Capital Economics analyst Vicky Redwood. 
 ""Given that the ONS kept its estimate of the weather impact
at 0.5 percent, this means that underlying growth was marginally
weaker than previously thought.""
 However, many analysts said they still expected the BoE to
start tightening policy in May to tackle inflation, which is
currently running at double the central bank's 2 percent target.
 ""I think May is still on the cards,"" said Richard Barwell,
economist at RBS. ""This is one bad quarter and we think it will
come back in Q1.""
 
 BELT-TIGHTENING
 While sticking to its line on the impact of the coldest
December in a century, the Office for National Statistics said
the downgrade to GDP was mainly due to lower production and
services output than it estimated last month. 
 A breakdown of the figures showed household spending fell
0.1 percent, the first decline in 18 months, and suggesting that
Britons were tightening their belts even before the rise in VAT
sales tax at the start of this year.
 That chimes with recent surveys showing consumer morale
remains in the doldrums. Stores have also been having a hard
time, with retail bellwether John Lewis on Friday reporting a
fifth consecutive week of poor sales.
 A survey by the Confederation of British Industry on
Thursday showed retail sales grew at their slowest pace since
last June, and looked set to deteriorate further.
 Friday's ONS data showed output in the services sector was
revised down to show a fall of 0.7 percent from 0.5 percent
previously. Industrial output was revised down to show a rise of
0.7 percent compared with 0.9 percent.
 Meanwhile, price pressures surged, with the implied
deflator shooting up to 1.0 percent on the quarter from 0.3
percent in Q3 2010.
 Imports rose at their fastest pace in 18 months, outpacing
exports and resulting in net trade subtracting 0.3 percentage
points from GDP.
 Without government spending, which rose by 0.7 percent on
the quarter, the contraction in overall GDP would have been even
sharper.
 ""This is fairly worrying given we know about the wave of
fiscal austerity that is now starting to hit the UK economy,
meaning that we will soon be starting to see nega tive figures
for this component,"" said James Knightley, economist at ING.

to $8 bln	
 * Price band for solar credit at $264-$374 per unit	
 * Wind, biomass certificates range $33-$86 per unit	
 
 By Ratnajyoti Dutta	
 NEW DELHI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - India's largest power exchange
is hoping to ramp up volumes in the trade of renewable energy
credits from April 2012, its chief said, seeking to tap a market
estimated to be worth $8 billion by 2017.	
 Jayant Deo, chief executive of Indian Energy Exchange (IEX)
which this week launched the inaugural trading session for
certificates aimed at rewarding producers of clean energy, said
volumes would increase once the process to issue renewable
credits to companies was streamlined.	
 Trade bodies told Reuters only two projects had received the
go-head to sell renewable credits. However, the website of the
official agency administering the project showed no certificates
had yet been issued.	
 Deo told Reuters there was huge interest in the renewable
energy certificates (RECs), which he said would encourage
project developers to invest in solar, wind and biomass.	
 ""We have developed a platform of physical trade between
buyer and seller, but it is not a futures platform where
speculators can take positions.""	
 Under the scheme, REC trading would occur for two hours
during the last Wednesday of every month.	
 Last year, India crafted rules for domestic REC trading, a
move aimed to boost the share of electricity from green sources
in the world's third-worst greenhouse gas emitter.	
 RECs can be bought by companies to meet statutory
obligations to purchase a minimum level of renewable energy. One
REC represents one megawatt-hour of energy generated from
renewable sources and remains valid for a year.	
 Renewable energy accounts for barely 8 percent of India's
total power generation capacity of about 150,000 megawatts but
the government aims to double green power generation to 25,000
megawatts in three years.	
 The rules stipulate clean energy producers either sell their
electricity at a preferential tariff fixed by provincial power
regulators or sell the electricity generation and environmental
attributes associated with renewable power separately.	
 A central agency administers the certificates trading among
renewable power generators.	
 For full details of new rules, double click: http://cercind.gov.in/Regulations/REC_PRESS_RELEASE_2010.pdf
 
 Deo said the exchange had received a total of 136
bids, including 11 for solar plant units, while the rest were
for wind, hydropower or biomass projects.	
 The price band for solar certificates will be $264-$374, and
the band for wind and biomass certificates ranges $33-$86 per
unit.	
 
 NEW DOMESTIC MARKET 
 Deo said RECs trading would receive a boost in the
June- September monsoon season when wind energy projects would
run full capacity, and also from October when sugar mills start
producing bagasse during the cane season.	
 India is one of the world's top producers of wind energy,
and also generates solar energy as well as power from biomass
and biogas, such as capturing methane from animal waste.	
 It hopes to attract about $21 billion worth of investments
in renewable energy by 2012.	
 India offers subsidised loans to companies building
alternative energy power plants and provides tax breaks and
tariff subsidies to encourage development of the renewables

 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Oil resumed its surge on Friday,
as political tension in North Africa showed little signs of
abating and stock prices were checked on fears that runaway oil
prices will constrain global growth.
 Brent oil  traded higher, despite assurances by top
oil exporter Saudi Arabia that it would step in to fill any
shortfall due to supply disruptions from oil-rich Libya.
Analysts predicted that elevated oil prices could trigger more
selling in stocks and other risky assets. [ID:nLDE71N13Q].
 European stocks climbed, taking a breather after a week-long
retreat, although sentiment was fragile. The FTSEurofirst 300

1,150.41 points, having lost 3.5 percent over the past week.
 ""The Libyan crisis really brought back the geopolitical

 Even if oil markets stabilise, broader sentiment could
remain cautious as high fuel prices would add to inflationary
pressures and crimp consumer demand. That could threaten growth
in Asian economies, the drivers to a global recovery since the
2008 financial crisis hit output worldwide.
 Since the Libyan crisis erupted earlier this month, some of
the worst performing markets within Asia are India, South Korea
and Taiwan due to their higher dependency on oil imports, Brown
Brothers Harriman said.
 Analysts reckon the degree of vulnerability for G-10 oil
importers is far less than that found in emerging economies.
 ""Our own analysis indicates that net oil imports for many
emerging economies in Asia are close to or greater than 5
percent of GDP,"" said Andrew Cox, G-10 strategist at Citi.
 
 OIL'S FIRM BIAS
 Brent crude oil futures  rose $1.45 to $112.81 per
barrel, while U.S. crude  rose to $98 as Libya output cuts
weighed. Key Libyan oil terminals are under rebel control while
Muammar Gaddafi's forces have fought back against the rebellion
[ID:nLDE71O00I].
 Estimates varied on how much of Libya's production is down
with the International Energy Agency pegging the volume shut at
500,000 to 750,000 bpd. Italian oil company ENI  said as
much as 1.2 million bpd may be down. 
 Although oil prices have come off 2-1/2 year highs, they are
still up 12 percent in the past three sessions alone, raising
concerns about a wider slowdown in global growth and lending
support to safe-haven assets such as gold, U.S. Treasuries and,
of late, the Swiss franc.
 The dollar stayed near a record low against the franc 
on Friday with some analysts saying that higher oil prices are
seen to have a bigger impact on the U.S. economy given its
reliance on consumer spending for growth.
 It has fallen nearly 4.8 percent against the franc in the
last two weeks, its worst showing since June.
 Meanwhile, the euro  was steady at $1.3805, hovering
near 2011 highs versus the dollar helped by more hawkish
comments from European Central Bank officials. [ID:nWEB1519].
 ECB officials have recently talked tough about fighting
inflation, reinforcing a market view that the Bank will raise
interest rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 ""The contrasting policy outlooks for Europe and the U.S.
have helped the euro and weighed on the dollar, and it wouldn't
be surprising to see the euro test the early February highs,""
said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 Gold, another haven in times of global turmoil, rose above

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 04:36AM ET</span>",UK Q4 GDP fall even sharper than first thought," LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Britain's economy contracted even
faster than previously thought in the last three months of 2010,
shrinking by 0.6 percent, after downward revisions to industrial
and services output, official data showed on Friday.
The figures may make Bank of England policymakers think twice
about raising interest rates, although there have been signs
that activity picked up at the start of this year followi ng
December's snow-related disruption.
 Analysts had expected an unchanged reading of -0.5 percent.
 The Office for National Statistics said the downgrade was
mainly due to lower production and services output than it
estimated last month. It stuck to its estimate that severe
weathe r in December -- the coldest in a century -- accounted
for 0.5 percentage points of the decline.
 The figures highlight the dilemma facing the Bank of
England which needs to steer inflation back to target but is
reluctant to raise interest rates when a sustained recovery is
far from assured.
 A breakdown of the figures showed household spending fell
0.1 percent, the first fall in 18 months. The fall shows
households were tightening their belts even before the rise in
VAT sales tax at the start of this year, and an intensification
of the government's spending squeeze.
 Output in the services sector was revised down to show a
fall of 0.7 percent from 0.5 percent previously. Industrial
output was revised down to show a rise of 0.7 percent compared
with 0.9 percent.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near 2011 highs
against the dollar on Friday, helped by inflation-fighting
rhetoric from euro zone policymakers, while concern that unrest
in Libya might spread kept the Swiss franc near a record high.
 A weekly close above the early February high of $1.3862
would leave the euro well placed for further gains towards
$1.40, but this level was seen as strong resistance, with the
dollar's falls tempered as oil prices came off 2-1/2 year highs.
 Growing expectations for higher interest rates in the euro
zone while policy in the U.S. remains loose have supported the
euro, with European Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber saying
on Thursday the only direction for rates was up.
 Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, seen as a leading
candidate for the ECB presidency, said in a newspaper interview
the bank would have to guarantee that inflation expectations
remain well anchored.
 ""The contrasting policy outlooks for Europe and the U.S.
have helped the euro and weighed on the dollar, and it wouldn't
be surprising to see the euro test the early February highs,""
said Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 He said a close above that level would be ""significant"" for
the euro technically.
 The euro was steady at $1.3802. A break past $1.3862 would
mark its highest level since early November. Beyond there,
resistance lies at $1.3947, the 76.4 percent retracement of a
November to January slide, and at $1.3974, the euro's intraday
high on Nov. 9.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was steady at
77.080, near a 3-1/2 month low of 76.881 but helped a little as
oil prices came off recent highs due to a slight easing of
concern about supply disruption from the Middle East.
 The dollar has failed so far to gain any safe haven support
as a result of the tensions in North Africa and the Middle East,
which have mainly benefited the Swiss franc and the yen as
investors pared exposure to riskier assets.
 Higher oil prices are seen as having a bigger impact on the
U.S. economy given its reliance on consumer spending for growth.
 However, Societe Generale's Juckes said the dollar would
probably gain from a flight to safety if the tensions were to
escalate to the point where investors fear there is a serious
threat to the global economic recovery.
 Analysts also said further euro gains may be limited if the
focus switches back to euro zone fiscal problems, with a lot of
debt issued by its struggling peripheral countries due to mature
in April.
 
 MARKET SEEN LONG SWISS FRANC
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 0.9272 Swiss francs,
though it was not far from a record low of 0.9229 francs hit on
trading platform EBS late on Thursday. 
 But with many market players now probably long on the Swiss
franc, the currency may face some liquidation of long positions,
especially if oil prices stabilise, market players said.
 ""That safe-haven trade of going long Swiss may just turn
around a little bit,"" said a trader at a U.S. investment bank.
 The dollar was steady against the yen at 81.93 yen while the
euro edged up slightly to 113.10 yen.
 In a sign that market players are not expecting the Middle
East unrest to trigger an acute bout of risk aversion, implied
volatilities on dollar/yen options quickly lost steam.
 One-month dollar/yen volatility slipped back below 10
percent after shooting above that threshold earlier this week.
 ""I suspect the market's focus will shift back to the
(economic) recovery story from the Middle East by the time we
have U.S. payroll data next week,"" an options trader in Tokyo
said.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent to $1.0102,
underpinned by strong gains against its New Zealand counterpart
, as investors priced in prospects of a cut in New Zealand
interest rates following an earthquake.
 The Aussie rose to a 10-year high of NZ$1.3509 on diverging
outlooks for interest rates.

 * Central banks assessing whether oil spike effect permanent
 * Draghi says not involved in Goldman Sachs Greek deal
 
 (Adds detail, background)
 ROME, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The priority of the ECB must be to
control inflation, governing council member Mario Draghi said in
a newspaper interview in which he also defended his record as a
former executive of U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs.
 In an interview with the International Herald Tribune
published on Friday, Draghi said European Central Bank monetary
policy ""should first and foremost be geared toward price
stability.""
 Draghi, a leading candidate to take over as head of the ECB
when current President Jean-Claude Trichet steps down this year,
noted the ECB had not changed interest rates ""for a very, very
long time"", the newspaper reported.
 He said the central bank would have to ""guarantee that
inflation expectations remain well anchored.""
 Draghi seldom comments on monetary policy and his remarks
come as manoeuvering over Trichet's succession intensifies ahead
of a decision expected within months.
 Analysts and much of the financial press have pointed to
Draghi as the main candidate for the moment to succeed Trichet,
but they say he must deal with concerns in Germany that a
southern European would keep a looser rein on inflation.
 His remarks chime with hawkish statements by other ECB
policymakers, who have pointed in particular to the risks posed
to price stability by high commodity and energy prices.
 Central banks are trying to gauge whether the current oil
price spike will have ""a permanent effect on inflation or
whether it's just a one-off shock,"" the newspaper quoted Draghi
as saying.
 Draghi, governor of the Bank of Italy and head of the
Financial Stability Board, is a respected figure in
international policy circles and has attracted substantial
public support in the ECB race. 
 ""I regard Draghi very highly,"" Deutsche Bank 
Chief Executive Josef Ackermann said late on Thursday. ""He is
absolutely the best, no question about that. I think he's
excellent.""
 Others say the Italian's candidacy for the ECB could be
handicapped by southern European countries' record on public
finances and by his status as a former executive at Goldman
Sachs -- one of the investment banks at the centre of the
financial crisis. 
 Draghi denied he was involved in a 2001 derivatives deal
managed by the U.S. investment bank which has been attacked as a
measure that allowed the Greek government of the time to hide
serious budget problems ahead of its entry into the euro.
 ""I joined Goldman Sachs after these operations had been
undertaken, and that's it,"" he said. ""I was never involved in
this.""
 The head of the European Union's statistics agency earlier
this month said it had established that there was no problem
with the Greek swaps deals.

 * Telenor victory opens long-running arbitration case
 * Telenor loss positive for Vimpelcom deal with Sawiris
 
 By Victoria Howley
 LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - A London court may decide on
Friday whether to protect Telenor's voting rights in a decision
that could derail a $6 billion telecoms deal and re-ignite
tensions with Russia's Alfa Group.
 Norway's biggest telecom company is seeking an injunction to
prevent the dilution of its 36 percent stake in Vimpelcom,
Russia's second largest cellphone group, to the benefit of old
rival and co-owner Mikhail Fridman's Alfa Group.
 Alfa and Telenor ended years of acrimony in 2009, when they
combined their telecom holdings to form Vimpelcom.
 Vimpelcom is planning to buy control of emerging
markets-focused Orascom Telecom and Italy's Wind from
Egyptian-born telecom tycoon Naguib Sawiris, a deal that Telenor
is fiercely resisting.
 Alfa Group is backing the transaction, but Telenor says it
does not make financial or strategic sense.
 A ruling by London's Commercial Court in favour of Telenor
would open the door to a long-running arbitration process, which
would test Sawiris's patience, bankers said.
 ""Arbitration between Vodafone and the Polish shareholders in
Polkomtel took about three years. These things are not resolved
quickly,"" said a banker who advises European telecom companies.
 The deal, which will be put to a shareholder vote on March
17, would give Sawiris 30.6 percent of the voting rights in the
enlarged group, and cut Telenor's rights to 25 percent.
 ""If arbitration takes longer than six months, there is a
real risk that Sawiris will look to sell to someone else,"" said
Tim Daniels at broker Olivetree Securities.
 Sawiris needs a deal because he is blocked from repatriating
profits from Djezzy, Orascom's main revenue earning unit that
the Algerian government plans to nationalize.
 The tycoon is fighting a bitter and costly battle over taxes
with the Algerian authorities, and the clock is also ticking on
his maturing debt, totalling about $3 billion for Orascom alone
over the next three years.
 If Telenor wins the injunction, Vimpelcom must put enough
new shares into an escrow account so that Telenor's stake would
not change if the deal is voted through by investors.
 But Telenor would only get the shares if it won the
subsequent arbitration case.
 In a deal like this, existing shareholders normally expect
to be able to exercise pre-emptive rights and subscribe to new
shares on a pro-rata basis. 
 Vimpelcom is claiming the deal is not subject to pre-emption
rights, because a subsidiary of Alfa already owns shares in
Orascom, creating a loophole that means existing shareholders
cannot buy into new share issues.
 Telenor stands only a small chance of stopping the deal with
Sawiris if it loses the injunction, another banker said.
 It will then go to the investor meeting, where it may be
voted through, Telenor Chief Executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas has
said.
 ""We are a shareholder in Vimpelcom and whether we remain (if
the deal goes through) is a question that remains to be
considered,"" he told Reuters previously.

 * Reserve requirements also raised by 50-100 bps
 * C.bank concerned by inflation, risk of surge in inflows

(Adds background, quotes)
 By Lidia Kelly and Elena Fabrichnaya
 MOSCOW, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank surprised
markets on Friday by using its full range of weapons to tighten
monetary policy, sending a strong signal that it views rising
prices as a greater threat than slow economic growth.
 It raised all of its key interest rates by 25 basis points
-- in contrast to analysts' expectations of a rise only in
deposit rates -- and increased minimum reserve requirements for
the second month running.
 The rise in reserve requirements for foreign liabilities,
however, was double that on domestic ones -- something which
should discourage inflows of speculative capital and a sign of
the bank's concern that a stronger rouble would hurt growth. 
 ""The decision ... was taken due to continued high inflation
expectations and ... grounds for capital inflow into Russia
against the backdrop of high global oil prices,"" the central
bank said in a statement.
 The rouble scored fresh 10-month highs against the dollar on
the news, which came a day after hawkish Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin said it was time to raise rates to tame high inflation
[ID:nLDE71O0HL].
 Analysts had expected the rate decision to be a tough one,
with the regulator juggling soaring prices on the one hand and
the economy's dismal performance so far this year on the other,
but most had envisaged a softer approach [ID:nMSC000153].
 ""With such a move the central bank clearly signals their
concern over inflation -- and determination to move toward
inflation targeting,"" Aurelija Augulyte, an emerging market
analyst with Nordea Markets, said in a research note.
 The central bank raised the overnight deposit rate to 3.00
percent, as expected, and the refinancing rate to 8.00 percent.
 Requirements for liabilities to non-residents were raised by
100 basis points to 4.5 percent, and for other liabilities by 50
basis points to 3.5 percent.
 
 STEPPING UP
 The worst drought in over a century killed a third of
Russia's harvest last year, pushing up the cost of food and
driving a surge in headline inflation. 
 Price pressures have since spilled into other sectors,
further fuelled by the fading of a favourable base effect
enjoyed for much of 2010.
 Consumer prices have risen 3.1 percent so far this year,
putting in jeopardy the official inflation target of 6-7 percent
for the whole 2011. 
 Russia had responded with a deposit rate hike already in
December and an increase in reserve requirements in January but
this month's moves stepped up the campaign.
 ""It's quite encouraging to see that they're willing to adopt
a quite unconventional ... response,"" David Oxley, an emerging
markets economist with Capital Economics said.
 The risk, though, is that the rate hikes provoke further
speculative capital inflows, boosting the rouble and making it
harder for Russia's non-oil economy to develope.
 Unlike other emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia has
repeatedly pledged to refrain from capital controls. Because its
economy is so closely-linked to oil, it also faces the prospect
of higher global fuel prices prompting more rouble strength.
 The upheaval in the Arab world, including in the major oil
producer Libya, have sent crude prices soaring to levels not
seen since 2008 amidst fears of supply shortages [O/R].
 Data from EPFR Global shows that Russia attracted relatively
strong inflows for a 13th straight week, of $162 million.
 But for now, inflation concerns -- cited as a key worry by
Russian voters -- seem to dominate the agenda.
 ""There was so much political pressure (they had to move),""
said Ivan Tchakarov, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Japan's public pension fund said
on Friday its rate of return on investments fell to plus 0.62
percent in October-December but it managed to produce a profit
due to a rise in share prices.
 The portfolio of the Government Pension Investment Fund
(GPIF), the world's largest public pension fund, was undermined
by falls in domestic and foreign bond prices.
 The performance of GPIF, which needs to raise returns for a
rapidly ageing population, translates into a profit of 719.3
billion yen ($8.78 billion) for October-December, down from a
positive return of 1.53 percent or a profit of 1.77 trillion yen
in July-September.
 But the public pension fund's total assets fell to 116.3
trillion yen ($1.42 trillion) by the end of December against
117.6 trillion yen in September.
 The size of its assets is larger than either the Canadian or
Indian economies, and the fund is a major force in the Japanese
government bond market, where it parks two-thirds of its assets.
 The GPIF became a net seller in the financial year that
ended last March in order to raise cash for pension payouts
after inflows from loans being paid back by semi-governmental
entities and other public entities ceased.
 The public pension fund managed to cover much of the
shortfall by proceeds of maturing Fiscal Investment and Loan
Program (FILP) or Zaito bonds, but it still had to sell a total
of 720 billion yen of JGBs in February and March last year.
 The GPIF has said it will be a net seller in the market for
several years due to the need for cash for pension payouts.
 For the current financial year to March 31, the fund said it
would need more than 6 trillion yen in cash for payouts.
 JGB market participants expect the GPIF to sell about 4-5
trillion yen worth of JGBs or other assets, taking account of
the proceeds of zaito bonds for the current year, analysts said.
 The public pension fund customarily does not comment on
details of its investment activity during the financial year,
and discloses details in an annual report expected around June.
 GPIF Chairman Takahiro Mitani told Reuters in an interview
on Wednesday the fund has already completed paying out pensions
to recipients earlier this month for the current financial year.
 Mitani said he still did not know how much cash the GPIF
would need for the financial year starting in April as the
government's budget has not yet been approved.
 GPIP LAGS CALPERS
 The fund's performance in the nine-month period to December
improved to minus 0.91 percent from minus 1.50 percent in the
April-September period, but sharply lagged other major overseas
counterparts, such as California Public Employees' Retirement
System (Calpers) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
 Calpers, which invests about a half its portfolio in
equities, produced a positive return of 8.9 percent over the
same period, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board raised
a return of 8.3 percent, a document by Japan's Health Ministry
showed.
 The GPIF produced a positive return of 8.71 percent, or a
1.1 trillion yen profit, on Japanese stocks in October-December.
 That compared with a negative return of 0.63 percent, or a
loss of 80.4 billion yen, for the previous quarter.
 The GPIF said it outperformed the Topix index of all
first-section shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by 0.24 percent
during the quarter.
 The fund's performance in other asset classes was largely in
line with benchmarks.
 The fund also posted a positive return of 5.55 percent, or
635.7 billion yen, on foreign stocks.
 But rises in Japanese government bond yields and U.S.
Treasury yields during the quarter hurt the fund's performance
in bonds.
 The GPIF recorded a return of minus 0.81 percent, or a 509.6
billion yen loss, on yen bonds and a negative return of 5.97
percent, or a loss of 573.1 billion yen, on foreign bonds.
 The rate of return on market investments, which excludes the
FILP, was plus 0.67 percent, or a profit of 652.0 billion yen
during the quarter.

a spike in oil prices, U.S. President Barack Obama said, as
Saudi Arabia offered some respite to fears over Middle East oil
supplies by indicating it can cover export cuts resulting from
Libya's civil war.	
 After a surge in Brent oil prices to 2-1/2 year highs near
$120 a barrel, South Korea, the world's fifth-biggest crude
importer, warned that its inflation situation was getting
tougher. 
 Business executives fretted about rising prices and
investment banks said oil was reaching an inflection point that
could endanger the world's recovery from the global financial
crisis.	
 ""We actually think that we'll be able to ride out the Libya
situation and it will stabilize,"" Obama, referring to fuel

 ""We have substantial capacity across the major economies in
the strategic reserves,"" Timothy Geithner said.	
 ""Hopefully, by reminding people of that and calling
attention to the fact that there's a fair amount of excess
capacity in parts of OPEC ... hopefully that will make it less
likely the market ... starts to build in higher prices over
time.""	
 
 The key risk for the world economy is a sustained rise in
the price of oil. But after shooting up to close to $120 a
barrel in intraday trade on Thursday, Brent crude futures
ended the day at less than $112, showing just how
fraught investors nerves are.	
 The sharp fall came after market rumours that Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi had been shot dead and on news that top producer
Saudi Arabia could cover any supply disruptions. 
 On Friday, Brent crude was trading around $112. U.S. crude
futures eased to $97.60 from a Thursday high of $103.41.	
 In Libya, forces loyal to Gaddafi hit back in fierce gun
battles with rebels holding towns near the capital but there
were no signs they had broken the opposition momentum.	
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
has an estimated 4-6 million barrels per day of spare crude
production capacity, more than enough on paper to cover Libya's
output of 1.6 million barrels a day.	
 But markets are worried that the unrest might spread to
bigger producers in the region that would have a much bigger
impact on the world economy.	
 After public uprisings have already toppled leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia, governments in the region are taking notice.	
 Saudi Arabia this week unveiled a $37 billion package to try
to insulate the kingdom from the wave of protests across the
Arab world, while Algeria lifted a 19-year-old state of
emergency as it tried to appease opposition groups.	
 ""When you start adding the potential number of barrels at
stake, you can see why the market is tense and would rather be
long oil than short,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, chief commodity
strategies at BNP in London.	
 
 INFLECTION POINT?	
 Deutsche Bank said oil above $120 a barrel would be an
inflection point for global economic growth. At that price, oil
as a share of global GDP starts to move above 5.5 percent,
historically a point where global growth has come under
pressure.	
 Airlines are feeling the brunt of high oil prices as
reflected in sharp falls in stock prices. Chinese flag carrier
Air China Ltd has dropped 14 percent this week.	
 ""Unfortunately, oil prices have been rising like mad
recently,"" said Li Jiaxiang, head of the Civil Aviation
Administation of China.	
 Emerging Asia, which led the world's recovery from the
global financial crisis, is already trying to deal with
escalating food prices. Higher oil prices will add to the
dilemma for policymakers of how to contain inflation and support
economic growth.	
 Yet another complication is that while the crude price
spikes this week reflect a supply-side risk, oil prices were
already rising as economic activity around the world picked up
pace.	
 ""The global recovery is ongoing, it is gaining more traction
but the developments in the crude-oil sector as a result of the
turmoil in the Middle East is putting to question the strength
of that recovery,"" said Jose Mario Cuyegkeng, economist at ING
in Manila.	
 Since most countries have little control over the world
price of oil, raising interest rates would not address the issue
for their economies. But higher fuel prices could feed through
to other prices, such as transport, and inflation expectations.	
 ""The environment influencing inflation is now much more
difficult than what we had expected at the end of last year,""
said Yim Jong-yong, South Korea's vice finance minister.	
 Indonesian central bank deputy governor Hartadi A. Sarwono
said he expects a recent drop in food and commodity prices to
push monthly inflation down in the country, but oil was a risk.	
 ""We have to be cautious on long-term inflation from rising
oil prices,"" he told reporters.	
 The combination of high oil prices undermining growth while
fuelling inflation raises the prospect of stagflation that
blighted economies in the 1970s.	
 Westpac rates strategist Russell Jones said there was a risk
of stagflation but there were economic differences now --
including less reliance on oil and better central bank
credibility -- to suggest any outbreak would be mild and short
lived.	
 Still, it would still result in a pick up in the pace of
monetary policy tightening, he said.	
 ""The longer that oil prices remain elevated, the more likely
that the European Central Bank and Bank of England could hike in
the second quarter. Emerging market central banks are also apt
to tighten more aggressively.

(Reporting by Quentin Webb)"
1248,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 02:12AM ET</span>",SPECIAL REPORT-The biggest company you never heard of," Where others saw risks, though, Glencore scented
opportunity. In June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an
Israeli mining magnate, paid 300 million pounds for a
quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to
revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga's. That deal gave
Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output -- an
""offtake"" agreement.
 Offtake deals are common in risky projects like mining,
where banks are reluctant to lend because of uncertainty about
how they will be repaid. An offtake ensures a miner has
customers before it starts digging, and provides a guaranteed
source of raw materials to a trader, which can also act as
security if the trader provides finance.
 By investing in Nikanor, Glencore consolidated a powerful
partnership: half of the stake it bought was on behalf of a
trust linked to Gertler, an old Congo hand who industry sources
say has close ties to government officials including President
Joseph Kabila.
 Katanga's mines were just months from producing copper and
cobalt again. The mining company had spent the summer of 2007
fighting off a hostile bid from Central African Mining and
Exploration Company (CAMEC), headed by Edmonds, the former
cricketer. After searching fruitlessly for a ""white knight"" -- a
big miner willing to pay top dollar to fend off CAMEC -- Katanga
turned to Glencore.
 The trading company was ready to oblige. In October it
agreed to a 10-year offtake deal and a loan of $150 million that
could be converted into Katanga shares. Just one month later,
Katanga and its neighbour Nikanor merged, giving Glencore 8.5
percent of the enlarged firm.
 In June 2008, with the global financial crisis deepening,
Katanga Chief Executive Art Ditto resigned for ""personal
reasons"". Glencore, exercising a clause from its earlier Nikanor
purchase, appointed a caretaker chief executive. It was then
that Katanga embarked on its increasingly desperate search for
new funds.
 Issuing a statement that said it was ""in serious financial
difficulty"", Katanga struck its deal with Glencore, which added
$100 million plus outstanding interest to its earlier loan, to
give a total of $265 million. The Swiss trading firm
subsequently sold on about a quarter of the loans to RP Capital,
a hedge fund also linked to Gertler. Then in a linked deal that
closed in July 2009, Katanga's debt burden was slashed by
swapping the loans for shares alongside a $250 million rights
issue. Most of that equity, too, went to Glencore.
 Now Glencore had a mining complex with the potential to be
Africa's biggest copper producer. To approve the arrangement,
Katanga had used Toronto stock exchange rules that exempt
companies in financial distress from a shareholder vote. That
left most of Katanga's minority shareholdings facing a virtual
wipeout from the heavy dilution, a measure they voted through in
a subsequent shareholders' meeting.
 ""Everybody got taken down. There were a couple of savvy guys
who got out early, but most people got taken for a ride. It's a
sad story,"" said analyst Cailey Barker with Numis Securities in
London.
 Barker says Katanga had little choice but to accept
Glencore's terms since it was probably a couple of weeks away
from bankruptcy. ""The only person that was left was Glencore,""
Barker said. ""They said we'll get involved, but we'll take our
pound of flesh.""
 This sort of deal -- with the right to convert debt into
equity in the tail -- has proved pivotal to Glencore as it has
built up its mining assets. Analyst Michael Rawlinson at Liberum
Capital, who was previously an investment banker for JP Morgan
Cazenove and has worked on deals in Congo for Nikanor, says the
fact Glencore was on the spot is key.
 ""If you're someone like Rio (Tinto) or Anglo (American),
often in these early-stage places you have no reason to be
there, you haven't got any assets there,"" he says. ""But if
you're Glencore, you source concentrate and product from these
places, you have trading relationships. They're on the ground
first, so they see these opportunities first.""
 Glencore is constantly cutting similar deals, some of the
biggest of which it already has in place with its Swiss
neighbour and close affiliate Xstrata. In the space of two weeks
recently, Glencore agreed offtake deals with London Mining for
its Sierra Leone iron ore production and Mwana Africa for nickel
output in Zimbabwe. The deals often come with, or are followed
by, a financing arrangement: U.S. PolyMet Mining Corp, for
instance sealed an arrangement in January that involves Glencore
buying shares with the right to convert the company's debt into
equity.
 
 A NECESSARY EVIL
 People familiar with the IPO planning say Glencore's top
managers have yet to give a final sign-off to a float, though
Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are all working on
the potential transaction. The earliest possible date for a
launch would be April, after first-quarter results are compiled.
 It's inevitable that the timing will attract attention.
 ""It's almost guaranteed that when they decide to list,
everyone will say they're calling the top of metals market,""
says analyst Tom Gidley-Kitchin at Charles Stanley in London.
""Like Goldman, people will ask, 'Why are they selling now?'""
 As one mining industry source puts it: ""We all know that
Glencore never leaves any crumbs on the table.""
 Like Goldman, which floated in 1999, Glencore wants the
permanent capital that comes with a listing. In a private
partnership, payouts to departing partners shrink the capital
base, but public companies' equity remains intact even if the
shares change hands at dizzying speeds.
 Raising public capital would help Glencore pay out any
retiring employees, whose compensation is now set to be
disbursed over five years from the firm's $20 billion book
value. 
 New equity would also reassure the big credit rating
agencies, which rate Glencore debt a notch or two above ""junk"".
The more flexible capital structure that comes with a listing
should also allow it to make really meaty acquisitions.
 It has long been Glasenberg's ambition to merge Glencore
with London-listed Xstrata, industry sources say. The companies
are already so close that the Financial Times' influential Lex
column has dubbed them the ""Tweedledum and Tweedledee"" of their
industry. Glencore owns 34.4 percent of Xstrata stock, they
share a chairman, Willy Strothoffe; and Xstrata's assets could,
in a stroke, fill the gaps in Glencore's portfolio to create a
mining and trading powerhouse. 
 But when speculation surfaced last year around a
Glencore-Xstrata merger, Xstrata shareholders opposed it,
arguing a valuation for Glencore should be set by market forces,
not agreed to behind closed doors. ""It's very difficult to value
Glencore because you just don't know enough about it. That's why
most investors would prefer an IPO -- which will give you more
visibility,"" one of the top 10 biggest institutional investors
in Xstrata told Reuters last year.
 Perhaps to force things to a head, Glencore in December 2009
set the clock ticking on a change in its set-up by issuing a
convertible bond. A year after picking up Katanga, the firm sold
$2.2 billion in bonds that can convert into shares to a select
band of investors, including energy-focused private equity firm
First Reserve, Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, China's
Zijin Mining Group, financier Nathaniel Rothschild plus U.S.
fund managers BlackRock, Fidelity and Capital Group."
1249,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2011 01:56AM ET</span>",Japan rare earths imports from China slump in Jan," TOKYO, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Japanese imports of rare earths
from China slumped in January, halving from volumes imported in
December, reflecting Beijing's tightening of trade in the
strategic metals used in high-tech electronics, magnets and
batteries.
 Data from Japan's Ministry of Finance on Friday showed that
imports of rare earths from China stood at 1,783 tonnes, more
than halving from from 4,080 tonnes imported in December.
 December imports jumped from 634 tonnes in November after
trade resumed following Beijing's de-facto ban on shipments
halted flows of the minerals for two months from late September.
 Japan's rare earth imports from China for the whole of 2010
stood at 23,310 tonnes, accounting for some 82 percent of the
total import volume of the minerals. Japanese firms consume about
30,000 tonnes a year of rare earths.
 Japan has been stepping up efforts to diversify its sources
of supply of the strategic minerals, including an agreement with
Mongolia to cooperate on developing rare earths and striking a
tie-up with a mining company in Australia.
 On Friday, the trade ministry said Japan aims to cut rare
earth consumption by a third within a few years and reduce its
reliance on China, by providing subsidies for recycling and
investing in new ways to limit their use.

* Not worried about UK inflation as wage growth will be slow 
* Indicates has not changed view on more quantitative easing	
 
MUMBAI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker Adam
Posen said on Friday that he does not expect current general
inflation trends to continue beyond a few years.	
Posen, saying he was expressing his personal views, was
speaking at a conference at the Indira Gandhi Institute of
Development Research, an institute established and financed by
the Indian central bank. 
Asked if inflation in general would remain high for a long
time, he replied ""I don't think that's what's going to happen...
It may happen for a few years ... but I think it is
fundamentally uneconomic to believe that markets do not adjust,
economies do not adjust.""	
 He also said he was not worried about inflation in the UK,
partly because wage growth was ""going to be very low for the
next couple of years."" 
 UK inflation is running at double the BoE's 2 percent target
and is set to quicken further. This has put pressure on the
central bank to raise rates, which it has kept at a record low
of 0.5 percent since March 2009. 
 Posen has opposed raising rates, maintaining that the BoE
should not allow fears of higher inflation expectations to force
it into an increase.	
 In his view, people calling for increases now overestimated
the impact of rises in short-term infaltion expectations on
British wages.	
 At a meeting on Feb. 9-10, the 9-member Monetary Policy
Committee voted 6-3 to keep rates unchanged. At its previous
meeting, the vote for leaving rates alone was 7-2. Minutes of
the latest meeting, released on Wednesday, showed that BoE chief
economist Spencer Dale changed his view and endorsed increasing
rates.	
 Asked in Mumbai if he had changed his view on quantitative
easing, Posen said ""As of the minutes released last week I voted
for further quantitative easing.""	
 Previously, he has called for a 50 billion pound ($81.2
billion) expansion to the BoE's programme of quantitative easing
to 250 billion pounds.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The euro edged closer to
a key resistance against the dollar on Friday, supported by more
inflation-fighting rhetoric from the European Central Bank,
while the Swiss franc touched a new peak on fears the unrest in
Libya may spread to other oil producers. 
 The dollar's fall, however, was tempered somewhat after oil
prices came off of 2-½ year highs, and market players said the
U.S. currency could regain ground in the near-term if short
dollar positions against the Swiss franc are unwound.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.3828 , nearing
resistance at $1.3862, a peak reached in early February.
 One possible resistance above that lies at $1.3947, the 76.4
percent retracement of the euro's November to January slide.
Another is $1.3974, the euro's intraday high on Nov 9.
 ""While in Europe there is talk of monetary tightening due to
inflationary pressures, rises in oil prices are seen as negative
for the U.S. economy,"" said Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at
Credit Suisse in Tokyo.
 ""Yield differentials have been moving against the dollar,""
he added.
 Higher oil prices are seen as having a bigger impact on the
U.S. economy given it's reliance on consumer spending as a
source of growth.
 Lending support to the euro were more hawkish comments from
European officials. ECB policymaker Axel Weber said the only
direction for interest rates to go is up. [ID:nWEB1519]
 Other ECB officials recently talked tough about fighting
inflation, reinforcing market view that the ECB will raise
interest rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 One trader said the euro was likely to be supported until an
ECB policy meeting next week and could rise above the February
peak of $1.3862. But further gains may be limited since a lot of
debt issued by euro zone peripheral countries is due to mature
in April, and could put the focus back on their fiscal woes.
 The euro's recent ascent has come not only against the
dollar but also against some emerging Asian currencies, in a
possible sign of investors shifting out emerging market assets
and into developed markets.
 The euro has climbed 3.4 percent against the Taiwan dollar
 so far in February and 1.6 percent against the South
Korean won .
 MARKET SEEN LONG SWISS FRANC
 The dollar hit a record low of 0.9229 Swiss francs on
trading platform EBS earlier on Friday. After trimming some
losses, the dollar it stood at 0.9251, down 0.1 percent from
late U.S. trading on Thursday.
 ""Among the currencies typically regarded as safe havens,
namely the dollar, yen and Swiss franc, the Swiss franc may be
the currency that is closest to seeing its interest rates rise,""
said Credit Suisse's Fukaya, referring to the potential for
monetary tightening by Switzerland's central bank.
 But with many market players now probably long on the Swiss
franc, the currency may face some long liquidation, especially
if oil prices stabilise, market players said.
 ""That safe-haven trade of going long Swiss may just turn
around a little bit,"" said a trader at a U.S. investment bank.
 The dollar inched up 0.1 percent against the yen to 81.93
yen  and the euro rose 0.3 percent to 113.29 yen
. A trader for a Japanese bank cited yen-selling
against the dollar and other currencies by Japanese importers.
 In a sign that market players are not expecting the Middle
East unrest to trigger an acute bout of risk aversion, implied
volatilities on dollar/yen options  quickly lost steam.
 One-month dollar/yen volatility slipped back below 10
percent after shooting above that threshold earlier this week.
 ""I suspect the market's focus will shift back to the
recovery story from the Middle East by the time we have U.S.
payroll data next week,"" an options trader said.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $1.0131 ,
underpinned by strong gains against its New Zealand counterpart
, as investors priced in prospects of a New Zealand
rate cut following the deadly earthquake.
 The Aussie rose to a 10-year high of NZ$1.3509 ,
up about two cents on the week on diverging outlooks for
interest rates.

 * European stocks open higher
 * Credit spreads tighten slightly as risk aversion fizzles

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Oil jumped by more than $2 to
above the $113 per barrel on Friday as another bout of nerves
spread in the market on concerns that spreading unrest in Libya
could hit fuel supplies.	
 Brent oil had pulled back following a 7 percent
surge to almost $120 on Thursday after rumours that Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi had been shot and on Saudi Arabia's
reassurances that it could counter Libyan supply disruptions.

 But Saudi reassurances were not enough to calm jittery
markets with analysts predicting that further rise in oil prices
could trigger more selling in stocks and other risky assets.	
 ""When geopolitics in the Middle East are at play in the oil
markets, all conventional bets on the direction of oil prices
based on supply and demand fundamentals, or economic variables,
are off,"" analysts at BNP Paribas said in a research note.	
 Stocks recovered smartly on Friday after heavy selling this
week on hopes that a recent surge in prices may have been
overdone, though traders said the situation was still too fluid
to take any aggressive bets.	
 European shares rose, breaking a five-day falling spree.

 Japan's Nikkei average rose for the first time in
four days while Hong Kong's stocks gained, helped by strong
earnings from insurer AIA Group and a rebound in
airline shares.	
 The MSCI index of Asia-ex Japan stocks was
up more than a percent, though down nearly 3 percent this week.	
 ""Foreign investors are buying back after the Nikkei lost
some 400 points this week, but it's still early days and we need
to wait to see what happens in Libya over the weekend to be able
to say if the correction is already over or not,"" said Toshiyuki
Kanayama, a market analyst at Monex Inc.

 Story on oil prices impact 
 Column on the euro's strength 
  
 Broader sentiment remained cautious as still- elevated oil
prices could hurt government budgets given widespread fuel price
subsidies in the region apart from negative impacts on
inflation, growth and trade balances.	
 Since the Libyan crisis erupted, some of the worst
performing markets within Asia are India , Korea
and Taiwan due to their higher dependency on oil
imports, Brown Brothers Harriman said.	
 
 FIRM BIAS	
 Although oil prices have come off 2-1/2 year highs, they are
up more than 12 percent in the past three sessions alone,
raising concerns about a wider slowdown in growth and retaining
a firm bias in the prices of safe haven assets such as gold,
U.S. Treasuries and of late the Swiss franc.	
 The dollar stayed above a record low against the franc
after suffering heavy losses overnight as investors
sought safety in other currencies, fearing the unrest in Libya
could spread to other oil producers.	
 It has fallen nearly 4.8 percent against the franc in the
last two weeks, its worst showing since June.	
 Meanwhile, the euro held near three-week highs, helped by
more hawkish comments from European Central Bank officials with
ECB policymaker Axel Weber saying the only direction for
interest rates to go is up. 
 Other ECB officials recently talked tough about fighting
inflation, reinforcing market view that the ECB will raise
interest rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve.	
 With markets continuing to focus on inflation-adjusted
returns, BNP Paribas said, the Fed is seen as least credible
central bank, the ECB as the most credible while the Bank of
England lying somewhere in between.	
 In credit markets, the benchmark for non-Japan Asia, the
iTraxx investment grade index saw its spreads
tighten by 2 bps to 109.5/111.5 after blowing out to its widest
level in nearly a month this week, traders said.	
 Gold, another safe-haven, consolidated around $1,400 an
ounce as safe-haven buying dried up after the rally in oil
fizzled.	
 U.S Treasuries held overnight gains in Asia, with 10-year
yields near a three-week low.

Giordani said in a presentation to parliament.
 By 2009, China had agreed to deposit $12 billion in the
fund in return for forward sales of oil. Giordani said
Venezuela was contributing an additional $2 billion.
 Separately, China has promised to provide the OPEC member
nation with $20 billion in a long-term financing deal, also in
return for oil. Venezuela uses part of the money to pay for
Chinese-built infrastructure projects such as railways.
 The government does not count the financing as sovereign
debt, despite pressure from the opposition to do so.

 By Risa Maeda and Osamu Tsukimori
 TOKYO, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Japan aims to cut rare earth
consumption by a third within a few years and reduce its reliance
on China, by providing subsidies for recycling and investing in
new ways to limit their use.
 Japanese firms consume about 30,000 tonnes a year of rare
earth minerals to produce mobile phones, electric car motors,
high-tech electronics parts and batteries.
 A spat over disputed islands in the East China Sea led to a
de-facto suspension by Beijing on exports of rare earths for some
months last year, sending Japan and other nations scrambling to
find alternatives.
 Some 160 projects by companies such as Intermetallics Co,
Hitachi Metals Ltd, Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co and Asahi Glass
Co will invest a combined 110 billion yen ($1.34 billion) by
March 2012, using government subsidies of 33.1 billion yen as
seed money, Japan's trade ministry said on Friday.
 That number is set to grow as the government solicits more
applications with the offer of another 8.9 billion yen in
subsidies.
 ""We've been supporting research and development in areas like
reducing the amount of rare earth in abrasives by allocating
money from our annual budget as well,"" Tsutomu Morisaki, director
at the ministry's nonferrous metals division, said at a news
conference.
 In addition to rare earths like cerium for abrasives and
dysprosium for magnets, Japan is also looking to cut down on its
use of cobalt and tungsten.
 These subsidies come on top of another 58 billion yen of
subsidies announced in October to develop mines abroad and to
research alternative materials.
 GARBAGE EXPORTS
 Hikaru Hiranuma, a researcher at private thinktank Tokyo
Foundation, said that given government support, companies will be
able to apply new technology to reducing usage of rare earths and
expanding facilities to recycle used materials.
 The shortage of such facilities in the past, due to low
procurement costs, resulted in some companies exporting used rare
earths as garbage, he said.
 Now that supply of rare earths is a risk for company
management, research is being carried out, for example, on
cutting the use of dysprosium, one of the rare earths most
vulnerable to China's export curbs, in magnets for hybrid cars
and wind power turbines, he said.
 ""I expect very speedy development as people become aware of
the need and benefits of these new technologies,"" Hiranuma said.
 Japan's rare earth imports from China in 2010 stood at 23,310
tonnes, accounting for some 82 percent of its total imports of
the strategic metals.
 They slumped in January, halving from volumes imported in
December.
 China, which produces 97 percent of the world's rare earths,
slashed its export quota by 40 percent in 2010 from 2009 levels
to about 30,000 tonnes and plans to trim it further this year.
 China has also announced increased export taxes on rare
earths.

 CHRISTCHURCH, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Rescuers extended their
search on Friday to shattered houses close to the epicentre of
Christchurch's deadly earthquake, but
rain and cold dimmed hopes of finding more survivors of New
Zealand's worst disaster in decades. 
 The arrival of teams from Britain and the United States, who
joined rescuers from Japan, Taiwan and Australia, allowed the
difficult search to push into beachside areas hardest hit by
Tuesday's 6.3 tremor in the country's second-biggest city.	
 In the community of Mount Pleasant, where the shallow quake
opened huge cracks in hillsides and sent car-size boulders
thundering down on homes, a small number of people had set up a
makeshift tent city in a school.	
 ""They've fled to the four corners of the compass,"" shouted
one unnamed man, gesturing to empty streets in what had become a
virtual ghost town of shattered houses and twisted streets.	
 The disaster has so far claimed 113 lives, and authorities
warned that toll was set to climb sharply in coming days with
grave fears for more than 200 people still missing.	
 Fears of a disease outbreak from contaminated water and
broken sewage services forced the closure of an emergency centre
and relocation of more than 100 people to another centre outside
the city of 400,000, where a night curfew remains in place.

 FACTBOX-New Zealand's biggest quakes

 
 
 Many of the missing were students who had come to the city,
one of New Zealand's most attractive, from Japan, China, Taiwan
and India to learn English against a backdrop of the country's
dramatic southern alps.	
 ""For those people in those far off places, your families are
our families, your children are our children,"" Christchurch
Mayor Bob Parker said in a message to their families overseas,
promising searchers would not abandon hope.	
 Tales were emerging of daring rescues, with doctors in the
depths of one collapsed building having to use a Swiss Army
knife to amputate one man's legs to free him.	
 ""There wasn't really any other option. Essentially the
procedure was performed with a Swiss Army knife. I know that
sounds terrible, but that's all we had,"" doctor Stuart Philip
told the Dominion Post newspaper.	
 Rescuers pulled aside massive stone blocks and 13 one-tonne
church bells from the toppled spire of the landmark ChristChurch
Cathedral in the city heart, where as many as 22 bodies could
now be trapped in a square popular with tourists. 
 ""We're having to move extremely slowly, we're working brick
by brick. There are a lot of loved ones in here that we want to
get out,"" rescue worker Steve Culhane told Reuters.	
 Police said 228 people were listed as missing. The list
could include many people whose bodies have been found but yet
to be identified. More than 2,500 were injured in the quake, and
more than 160 of them seriously.	
 Thousands of survivors queued for food, water, and cash
handouts from the government meant to help them survive, but
police said there was no need to stockpile petrol or supplies.	
 
 ECONOMIC IMPACT	
 More than half of the dead have come from the ruin of the
former Canterbury Television (CTV) building, which housed a
popular English language school. Around 65 people, including
many missing Japanese and Chinese students, are believed to be
still inside, caught as floors pancaked down on to one another.	
 ""We'll keep searching until such time as we have satisfied
ourselves beyond all possible doubt that there is no-one left
still to rescue in terms of an active find,"" said fire rescue
chief Jim Stuart Black. 
 An estimated 70 people have been rescued alive, but the last
survivor was pulled out on Wednesday mid-afternoon.	
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's backed New Zealand's
ability to withstand the massive economic impact of the quake,
saying the country's AA+ foreign rating with a negative outlook
was secure. 
 Early estimates of insurance losses have ranged between $3
billion and $12 billion. Prime Minister John Key said the
country's Earthquake Commission (EQC) disaster fund stood at
around NZ$6 billion before the quake, with reinsurance in place
and further government backing as needed.	
 Earthquake recovery minister Gerry Brownlee, a local member
of parliament, said costing the quake was guesswork.	
 ""I would expect that this will go beyond NZ$10 billion ($7.5
billion), and the figure will be somewhat north of that,"" he
told reporters.

 * Middle East tension fuels safe-haven demand
 * Oil rally fuels growth worries, hits U.S. dollar
(Updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc soared to a
record high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and the yen
gained broadly as fears the uprising in Libya could spill over
to other oil producers drove investors to seek safety.
 The dollar tumbled after a surge in oil prices stoked
worries about the impact on U.S. consumer spending, the engine
that drives the U.S. economy. Expectations the Federal Reserve
would lag other major central banks in raising interest rates
also pressured the currency.
 The Swiss franc may extend gains should turmoil in the
Middle East and Africa spread. Further strength in the yen
could be limited, however, with the Japanese economy vulnerable
to high oil prices and the risk of currency intervention by
Japanese officials to protect exports.
 ""If this unrest continues, I believe the Swiss franc will
probably be the main beneficiary,"" said Vassili Serebriakov,
currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""The dollar is struggling to live up to its 'safe-haven'
credentials,"" he said. ""There's some concern about the impact
of higher oil prices on the U.S. economy.""
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.9234 Swiss franc
 on trading platform EBS, with losses accelerating
after automatic sell orders were triggered below the previous
record low of 0.9301 set at the end of last year. The dollar
last traded down 0.7 percent at 0.9259 franc.
 The dollar has fallen nearly 4.8 percent against the franc
in the last two weeks, its worst showing since June.
 Technical analysts said the U.S. currency's break below
0.9309 franc, around major trendline support drawn from lows
hit in 1995 and 2008, had opened the way to more losses.
 One-month implied dollar/Swiss volatility continued to pick
up, trading around 11.20 percent  on Thursday,
although this was still well below levels of around 15 percent
seen at the start of the euro zone debt crisis in April 2010.
 The euro fell to 1.2706 Swiss francs , its
lowest since Jan. 13, and last traded down 0.4 percent at
1.2778.
 OIL AND DOLLAR
 Brent crude oil  leapt to its highest price since
August 2008 on concerns the unrest, which has cut more than a
quarter of Libya's output, could spread to other major oil
producers. For details, see [ID:nL3E7DO0SC]
 Historically, higher oil has tended to lead to a weaker
dollar because rising energy prices would cause consumers to
curtail spending, which accounts for about two thirds of the
U.S. economy.
 Credit Suisse said an analysis of data since 1999 shows the
U.S. dollar, as measured by the Federal Reserve's major
trade-weighted index, falls about 2.2 percent for every 10
percent rise in the oil price.
 ""Crucially, the Fed's policy response to oil shocks tends
to be dovish, whereas the ECB has historically reacted
hawkishly to energy price shocks,"" the firm wrote in a note to
clients.
 Recent hawkish comments from European Central Bank
officials have boosted expectations of higher euro zone
interest rates. European Central Bank policy maker Axel Weber
said on Thursday the only way for euro zone rates to go is up.
[ID:nWEB1519]
 In contrast, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James
Bullard said the Fed can ""never say never"" to another round of
quantitative easing, a scenario that typically undermines the
greenback. [ID:nDYE7DA02C]
 The euro hit a three-week high of $1.3822 on EBS 
and last traded up 0.4 percent at $1.3803.
 The next upside target is $1.3862, the February high. A
break above could see the euro rise toward the $1.3950 area,
the 200-week moving average.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar <.DXY>
slumped to its lowest level in three weeks at 76.991.
 Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.9 percent at 81.79
yen , after having hit 81.62 yen on EBS, the lowest
since Feb. 4. Traders cited dollar selling by Japanese
exporters and model funds, as well as some liquidation of long
dollar positions established since the beginning of the year.

 By Jeff Mason
 WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner sought to quell fears
on Thursday that unrest in Libya would put oil prices on a long
term upward trajectory.
 ""We actually think that we'll be able to ride out the Libya
situation and it will stabilize,"" Obama, referring to fuel
prices, told a group of corporate chief executives.
 Geithner said the world had plenty of oil reserves that
could be deployed in the event of a sustained disruption to
supply. ""We have substantial capacity across the major
economies in the strategic reserves,"" he told the executives.
 ""Hopefully, by reminding people of that and calling
attention to the fact that there's a fair amount of excess
capacity in parts of OPEC ... hopefully that will make it less
likely the market ... starts to build in higher prices over
time.""
 Oil futures were at their highest levels since late August
2008 as the escalating problems in Libya disrupted supply.
Brent rose near $120 in intraday trading though it later pulled
back to $111.12 in a sell-off sparked by rumors that Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi had been shot.
 Geithner and Obama spoke at the first meeting of a new
panel of business leaders the president has asked to come up
with ideas to boost U.S. competitiveness and hiring.
 Obama encouraged the business leaders not to worry about
inflation, an issue executives said was a growing concern.
 ""I think the emerging issue is inflation,"" General Electric
Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, who is chairing the new panel,
told the president during the meeting.
 When asked by reporters later whether he was concerned
about rising oil prices, Immelt did not answer directly.
 ""There's a lot going on in the world geopolitically. I
think we have to see what happens next and where things settle
in,"" he said. ""There's not a lot of core inflation even today
and I would say in general the economy is getting better every
day as a backdrop.""
 FOCUS ON JOBS
 Improving the economy is the core focus of the panel, which
replaces another group of advisers on U.S. economic recovery
led by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Volcker
stepped down when that group dissolved earlier this year.
 Immelt said the panel would focus on creating jobs and he
promised specific proposals for delivery to Obama within 90
days. The new panel includes several members from the old one.
 Citigroup Chairman Richard Parsons, American Express Co
Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault, AOL co-founder Steve Case,
Southwest Airlines Chief Executive Gary Kelly, DuPont Chief
Executive Ellen Kullman, and Intel Corp Chief Executive Paul
Otellini were among the panel's members.
 The executives expressed optimism about their companies'
growth prospects in 2011, but some said access to credit and
skilled workers was a persistent problem.
 Kullman said 2011 would not be as big a growth year for her
company as 2010, but she remained optimistic.
 Matt Rose, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's
Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, said he believed the
economy is ""better than what you read.""
 The group's next meeting will take place outside of
Washington in order ""to draw on the ideas and input of people
around the country,"" according to White House deputy
communications director Jen Psaki.

(Adds quote, Weber and Bullard comments, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar tumbled on
Thursday, with further losses seen amid a surge in oil prices
as investors feared a civil uprising in Libya could spill over
to other top producers including Saudi Arabia.
 Further hurting the dollar -- especially against the euro
-- were comments by St. Louis Federal Reserve President James
Bullard saying the Fed can ""never say never"" to another round
of quantitative easing, a scenario that typically undermines
the greenback.
 In contrast, the European Central Bank continued its
hawkish rhetoric, with ECB policymaker Axel Weber saying the
only way for euro zone rates to go is up.
 Weber's comments combined with Bullard's easing remarks
pushed the euro to fresh three-week highs against the dollar.
 The safe-haven Swiss franc, meanwhile, hit a record high
against the U.S. currency, benefiting from the ongoing
geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East. The franc has gained
in eight of the last nine sessions versus the dollar.
 In the last two weeks, the Swiss currency has risen 5.1
percent -- its best showing since late June of last year.
 ""In this kind of risk-averse environment, we would expect
the dollar to do a little bit better, but with oil prices
rising, the dollar is getting hit,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief
currency strategist, at TD Securities in Toronto.
 ""The difficulty here is that higher oil prices mean a lower
U.S. dollar. It's difficult to see the dollar doing
significantly better at the moment,"" he added.
 Brent crude oil leapt to its highest since August 2008 on
concerns the unrest, which has cut more than a quarter of
Libya's output, could spread to other OPEC-member producers.
 High oil prices tend to be negative for the dollar as the
United States is a heavy oil importer.
 In midday New York trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index
slumped to its lowest in three weeks at 77.011. It was last at
77.119, down 0.4 percent.
 ""Everybody and his mother have upgraded their forecasts on
oil prices, with one even forecasting oil to hit $200 per
barrel,"" said Ron Simpson, director currency research at Action
Economics in Tampa, Florida. ""That has weighed on the dollar.""
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.9240 Swiss franc on
electronic trading platform EBS, its slide having intensified
after triggering stop-loss selling below its previous record
low of 0.9301 set at the end of last year.
 The dollar last traded down 0.8 percent at 0.9249 franc.
 Technical analysts said the U.S. currency's break below
0.9309 franc, around major trendline support drawn from lows
hit in 1995 and 2008, had opened the way to more losses.
 One-month implied dollar/Swiss volatility continued to pick
up, trading around 11.20 percent on Thursday, although this was
still well below levels of around 15 percent seen at the start
of the euro zone debt crisis in April 2010.
 The euro also weakened against the franc, sliding to around
1.2706 francs, its lowest since Jan. 13, before pulling back to
1.2754, 0.6 percent lower on the day.
 The euro zone currency was last up 0.3 percent against the
dollar at $1.3778, staying supported on recent hawkish comments
on inflation by ECB officials. That increased expectations the
central bank may begin seriously considering an exit strategy
from ultra-low rates.
 The euro hit a high of $1.3822 on EBS, the highest since
Feb. 3, with traders now setting their sights on $1.3862, this
year's peak. Traders cited sell orders at $1.3810/25 before
stops through $1.3835.
 Some market participants also said offers above $1.3800 in
the euro were most likely related to the takeover of Genzyme
Corp by French drugmaker Sanofi-Avenits, reportedly a $20
billion all-cash deal.
 Turmoil in the Middle East also boosted the yen as
investors tend to buy back the yen in times of uncertainty as
they unwind risky assets funded by the Japanese unit's low
rates.
 The dollar was down 1.0 percent at 81.67 yen.
Traders cited dollar selling by Japanese exporters and model
funds, as well as some liquidation of long dollar positions
established since the beginning of the year.

 (Adds quote, background, Weber)
 FRANKFURT, Feb 24 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Thursday euro zone sovereign bonds
issued from 2013 should carry a clause allowing them to be
restructured if a majority of creditors so decide.
 Sovereign bonds should include collective action clauses
(CACs), providing for a specified majority of bondholders to
agree to a restructuring that would be binding on all holders of
that issue.
 This would prevent minority holders from blocking a deal, in
theory making debt restructuring easier.
 ""A mechanism must be included in bonds from euro zone member
states starting in 2013 that at least foresees a participation
of creditors through the corresponding collective action
clauses,"" Schaeuble said during a question and answer session at
Frankfurt University.
 Schaeuble's message echoed a call from European Central Bank
policymaker Axel Weber late on Wednesday for rules that would
require clauses in new debt contracts to involve private
bondholders in any future debt crisis.
 The German calls for private investors to carry more
exposure to a permanent euro zone rescue mechanism to be
launched in mid-2013 came ahead of a meeting of EU leaders next
month to discuss a deal on tackling the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Weber has suggested transforming international rescue loans
to debt-choked Greece and Ireland into 30-year loans, euro zone
sources have said. Current maturities are three years for Greece
and seven for Ireland.
 Schaeuble, meanwhile, has not ruled out a radical
reprofiling of Greek debt that might include private investors.
 Speaking about lessons from the economic crisis, Schaeuble
said both the state and central banks have roles to play in
preventing future crises from developing.
 Central banks must deliver price stability and stop asset
bubbles from forming, he said, while governments should
""regulate, supervise and every now and then adjust"" to prevent
financial markets from deepening future crises.
 Weber, also attending the event, said the only way for
interest rates was up.
 ""The situation we are in now means there's only one
direction rates can go, and that's north,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Oil surged to almost $120 a
barrel and the safe-haven Swiss franc hit a record high on
Thursday on fears turmoil in Libya could spread, but gold eased
on talk Saudi Arabia could boost its crude output.
 U.S. equity markets also hovered near break-even after this
week's sharp slide. Analysts said it was too soon to say a
long-expected sell-off on Wall Street was over with unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East still alive. For details

 The escalating violence in Libya, home to Africa's largest
proven oil reserves, lifted benchmark Brent crude oil to its
highest level since August 2008 and kindled concerns of an
inflationary spike that might stall global recovery.
[ID:nLDE71N1AY]
 This week's relentless surge in oil prices stung the U.S.
dollar against major currencies. The Swiss franc benefited from
the turmoil in North Africa while the euro extended gains
against the dollar on expectations interest rates in the euro
zone will rise earlier than those in the United States.
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.9240 of a Swiss franc
 on electronic trading platform EBS.
 ""The problem with civil unrest is that we don't really know
when it's going to end. It might get worse and the supply of
oil might come down even more, and that's a big concern for the
market,"" said Sebastian Lynar, sales trader at IG Index.
 Copper, considered a harbinger of economic sentiment,
firmed after better than expected U.S. jobless data, but it
remained under pressure on concerns that higher oil prices
driven by violence in Libya could slow economic growth.
[ID:nL3E7DO0Q5]
 Brent crude futures for April delivery  spiked to
$119.79 a barrel before easing to $114.55, up $3.30 on the
day.

under the $100 mark it touched on Wednesday for the first time
since October 2008.
 Spot gold prices  rose slightly to $1,412.00 an
ounce, up just $2.05.
 The Financial Times quoted an unnamed official as saying
Saudi Arabia was in active talks with European refiners who may
be hit by a disruption in Libyan exports.
 ""You can't see a quick resolution to what's going on, but I
see the market's fall as an over-reaction,"" said Caroline
Vincent, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management. ""There are
worries about oil prices and inflation, but Saudi Arabia has
said it will meet the oil shortfall.""
 Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched a counter-attack
but rebels threatened the Libyan leader's grip on power by
seizing important towns close to the capital and bringing the
tide of rebellion ever closer to his power base.

(Updates with details, background)
 By Matthias Sobolewski
 BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Germany could reach its main debt
reduction target by 2015, a year ahead of schedule, thanks to
stronger than expected economic growth and rising tax receipts,
government sources told Reuters on Thursday.
 Germany's debt-brake law, which took effect in 2011, obliges
the federal government to reduce the gap between revenue and
spending to under 10 billion euros annually by 2016.
 Germany aims to cut net new borrowing to 31.4 billion euros
next year, according to the draft proposal obtained by Reuters,
down from an initially planned 40.1 billion.
 In 2013, new borrowing should be 22.9 billion euros,
dropping to 15.7 billion in 2014 and 12.8 billion euros in 2015,
according to the draft, which is scheduled to be approved by
Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet on March 16.
 The plan will be the basis for the 2012 budget and the three
following years. The draft forecasts the government will have
tax revenues rising from 229 billion euros this year to 269
billion euros in 2015. 
 Despite the positive developments, Finance Ministry
officials said there was no scope for tax cuts -- a topic
raised again by the coalition's junior partner, the Free
Democrats, on Wednesday after a hiatus of several months.
 ""There is no room whatsoever for tax reductions,"" said a
Finance Ministry official.
 The draft also shows the government expects the economy to
grow at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent until 2015.
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble wants to keep
expenditure steady at about 305 billion euros per year to 2014,
thereafter rising slightly to about 309 billion euros due to
rising interest costs.
 If the government sticks to Schaeuble's plans, the deficit
could be cut from 30 billion euros currently to 10 billion euros
in 2015.
 ""It is mathematically possible,"" a senior government
official told Reuters, noting that would mean the government
meets the debt-brake target a year sooner than planned.
 From 2016, new borrowing cannot exceed 0.35 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) -- currently just under 10 billion.

 * Chinese paper makers face anti-subsidy tax of up to 16 pct
 * Further anti-subsidy challenges likely - diplomat
 * Tariff to be launched in May, hurting APP
 
 BRUSSELS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - European Union governments will
vote next month on the bloc's first ever challenge to Chinese
state subsidies, taxing imports of Chinese-made paper that EU
officials say benefit from illegal subsidy schemes.
 Member governments are largely expected to vote in favour of
duties of up to 16 percent, EU diplomats said on Thursday,
following findings by the EU's executive Commission that China
provides preferential loans and tax rebates to the paper sector
and to high-tech industries.
 In itself a small case -- Europe imported about 130 million
euros of Chinese coated fine paper in 2009 for use in brochures
and coffee-table books -- the EU challenge has the potential to
trigger similar cases from other industries under pressure to
compete with Chinese rivals.
 ""Coated paper will be a precedent and we'd expect this case
to be followed by a number of others from other industries,""
said an EU diplomat familiar with the issue.
 China has denied giving illegal state aid to its industries.
 
 SUBSIDY SUSPICIONS SOUR RELATIONS
 A report by the Commission seen by Reuters says China's
state planning system ""provides binding rules to all the
economic institutions in the form of directives on the promotion
and support of encouraged industries, one of which is the
papermaking industry"".
 ""The financing of the papermaking industry has to be
considered a subsidy,"" the document says.
 The report also says China provides illegal tax benefits for
the high-tech sectors and research and development, as well as
illegal local grants and land leases.
 If approved by EU states during a vote on March 17, duties
must launch by May 17 and may stay in place for five years. They
will mainly hit the Chinese operations of Indonesian paper giant
Asia Pulp and Paper.
 They will add to anti-dumping duties of up to 39.1 percent
applied provisionally to Chinese glossy paper last November to
balance out what the EU said was unfair export pricing by
Chinese producers.
 It may also prompt legal action by China, which is currently
appealing against a decision by the World Trade Organization
allowing the United States to act against Chinese state
subsidies.
 Long-term trade policy unveiled by the EU's executive last
year vows to face down unfair competition by other trading
powers -- particularly where they encroach on Europe's high-tech
industries -- but such resolve must be reconciled with hopes
that China will help the bloc overcome its economic crisis.

developing regions which have kept German price pressures in
check for years are now starting to fuel inflation as labour
costs in China and other parts of Asia rise, a study found.
 The rate of price rises for 50 less frequently bought goods
in the basket used to calculate German consumer price inflation
reached its highest point in two years in January, data from the
research institute for economic statistics at Switzerland's
Fribourg university showed.
 German consumers' recent perceptions of inflation have been
governed by higher costs for everyday goods such as food and
fuel, the University's statistics professor, Wolfgang
Brachinger, said.
 ""But the inflation picture is changing,"" German-born
Brachinger told Reuters on Thursday, a day ahead of the release
of German states' CPI data for February.
 ""We should reckon with a sea change in price developments of
goods that have been produced cheaply in Asia, and above all
China, for years.
 ""Everything suggests"" such goods will rise sharply in price
in coming months, as salaries in producer countries were rising
fast, as were raw materials prices, he said.
 German consumer prices rose 1.9 percent annually in January,
and under the European harmonised index -- which uses a
different goods basket -- they increased 2.0 percent for their
biggest gain since October 2008. Euro zone inflation hit 2.4
percent last month, high enough to create a policy dilemma for a
European Central Bank setting interest rates against the
backdrop of an uneven economic recovery and soaring oil prices.
 Brachinger, a former head of the Swiss statistics commission
who has also held professorships in Germany and the United
States, said that, by way of example, prices of leather jackets
rose 2.2 percent year on year in January.
 Suitcases were flat after falling 1.8 percent in December,
men's bathrobes rose 15.8 percent after a fall of 0.1 percent and
prices of sports articles were falling far less steeply than
previously.
 Euro zone inflation expectations over the coming year surged
in Thursday's economic sentiment index, with the measure hitting
25.7 points from 20.9 in January, significantly above the
long-term average since 1990 of 20.6.

 NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices soared to
almost $120 a barrel and the safe-haven Swiss franc hit a
record high on Thursday as the turmoil in Libya kept markets
tense, but gold and Wall Street even edged higher.
 The escalating violence in Libya, home to Africa's largest

 NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on
Thursday, with further losses seen as likely, pressured by a
surge in oil prices as investors feared civil unrest in Libya
could spill over to other top producers including Saudi
Arabia.
 The safe-haven Swiss franc, on the other hand, hit a record
high against the greenback, benefiting from the ongoing
geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East. The franc has gained
in eight of the last nine sessions versus the dollar.
 In the last two weeks, the Swiss currency has gained 5.1
percent so far, its best showing since late June last year.
 ""The focus is on the Middle East and oil prices. Everybody
and his mother has upgraded their forecasts on oil prices, with
one even forecasting oil to hit $200 per barrel,"" said Ron
Simpson, director currency research at Action Economics in
Tampa, Florida. ""That has weighed on the dollar.""
 Brent crude oil  leapt to its highest since August
2008 on concern that the unrest, which has cut more than a
quarter of OPEC-member Libya's output, could spread to other
producers. [ID:nL3E7DO0SC]
 High oil prices tend to be negative for the dollar as the
United States is a heavy oil importer.
 In early New York trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index
<.DXY> fell to its lowest in three weeks at 77.011. It was last
at 77.081.
 ""The nature of the crisis is dollar negative. It raises oil
costs and the U.S. is a big importer of oil, it hits household
wealth and productivity and growth more than anywhere else,""
said Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 He added that such concerns would overshadow the safe-haven
status of the world's largest reserve currency so long as
instability in the Middle East and North Africa remains an oil
supply issue and does not morph into a bigger, global problem.
 The dollar fell to a record low of 0.9240 Swiss franc
 on electronic trading platform EBS, its slide having
intensified after triggering stop-loss selling below its
previous record low of 0.9301 set at the end of last year.
 The dollar last traded down 0.7 percent at 0.9260 franc.
 Technical analysts said the U.S. currency's break below
0.9309 franc, around major trendline support drawn from lows
hit in 1995 and 2008, had opened the way to more losses.
 One-month implied dollar/Swiss volatility continued to pick
up, trading around 11.20 percent  on Thursday,
although this was still well below levels of around 15 percent
seen around the start of the euro zone debt crisis in April
2010.
 The euro also fell against the Swiss franc, sliding to
around 1.2706 francs , its lowest since Jan 13,
before pulling back to 1.2739, down 0.7 percent on the day.
 Turmoil in the Middle East also supported the yen.
Investors tend to buy back the yen in times of uncertainty as
they unwind risky assets financed by the Japanese currency's
low rates.
 The dollar was down 0.9 percent at 81.75 yen .
Traders cited dollar selling by Japanese exporters and model
funds, as well as some liquidation of long dollar positions
established since the beginning of the year.
 The euro  was up 0.3 percent against the dollar at
$1.3789, staying supported on recent hawkish comments on
inflation by European Central Bank officials. That increased
expectations the ECB may begin seriously considering an exit
strategy from ultra-low rates.
 Traders cited stops through $1.3700 and more through
$1.3680, with sell orders at $1.3810/25 before stops through
$1.3835.

 * Sees domestic gas prices rising
 * No current plans to invest in coal-bed methane blocks
 (Adds details)
 By Nidhi Verma and Jo Winterbottom
 NEW DELHI, Feb 24 (Reuters) - BP PLC figures there are at
least 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas resources in the 23
blocks it has bought into in its $7.2 billion deal with
Reliance Industries, its India head said, enough to meet the
country's current rate of consumption for 7 years.
 Sashi Mukundan also told Reuters that gas prices in the
Indian market had the potential to rise and, if necessary, the
two firms would build a terminal to import liquefied natural
gas (LNG) to take advantage of growing demand for market-priced
gas.
 According to BP's Energy Outlook 2030, India's daily gas
consumption in 2010 was estimated at 6.1 billion cubic feet
(bcf) and is expected to exceed 15 bcf in 2030.
 ""BP's estimate today is that (the 23 blocks) have 15 tcf
gas resources ... there is a much larger running room and our
coming into this (shows) we believe that we can jointly
significantly improve the production,"" Mukundan said in a
Thursday interview.
 Reliance's D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin off the
east coast is India's biggest gas producer, but output has
slipped on technical problems to about 52 million cubic metres
a day (mcmd) from 60 mcmd in 2010, and short of a target 80
mcmd.
 Mukundan was speaking to Reuters a day after returning from
the UK, where the companies signed the deal -- the biggest
foreign direct investment in India's exploration sector.
 The Indian partnership marks the second major deal under
BP's new chief executive Bob Dudley, who last month agreed a
share swap with Russia's state-controlled Rosneft to jointly
explore the Arctic for offshore oil and gas.
 It is BP's biggest investment in the exploration and
production space in Asia. The deal plants it firmly in its
fourth emerging BRIC economy, along with operations in Brazil
and China, after it picked up little in Indian government
licensing rounds.
 ""We missed the boat until NELP V,"" Mukundan said, adding
that in 1999, when India launched its New Exploration Licensing
Policy (NELP), gas prices were too low and the potential of the
country was not widely known.
 Cairn Energy, which picked up blocks in India before the
launch of NELP, is trying to sell a majority stake in its
Indian arm Cairn India to Vedanta Resources but is bogged down
in a royalty dispute with its Indian partner.
 HINDU WEDDING
 BP has no current plans to buy into Reliance's coal-bed
methane blocks, Mukundan added.
 ""We have seen good shows in Mahanadi, Krishna Godavari and
we have seen some shows in Cauvery, which we now look to build
upon ... there is a potential for us to significantly grow,"" he
said.
 Mukundan said the deal was exclusive to both the companies
and they could jointly look at further alliances.
 ""This is a Hindu wedding. This will last forever. That's
the plan,"" he said, when asked about the duration of the
tie-up.
 The equal joint venture between the two companies for
marketing and sourcing of gas should be operational in three to
six months, Mukundan said, to meet growing demand in the
world's second-fastest growing major economy.
 ""The (gas pricing) trend is upward ... the market has
appetite for higher priced gas,"" he said.
 ""Latent demand is being fully utilised and ... new demand
will be created on market fundamentals. It's not going to be
based on subsidy regime.""
 India approves the gas sales pricing formula from more
recent fields, while older fields awarded to state-run firms
have a subsidised price of $4.2/million British thermal unit
(mbtu).
 Mukundan said that 25-30 percent of India's gas consumption
is met by imported liquefied natural gas, which is sold at a
much higher price, and added that the government could agree
higher prices for future field developments.
 ""The government is flexible to look at each of the blocks
on its own merit. There is a discussion that some of the more
difficult blocks will probably end up with higher pricing.""
 He said the joint venture could build an LNG terminal and
pipelines if it could not find capacity at India's existing
facilities.
 ""If we can't get it and we still need to get it, we'll look
at the possibility of building our own terminal if needed.""

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2011 08:08AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-INTERVIEW-Bahrain saw no major capital flight-c.banker," * Government to issue $1 billion bond when costs reasonable
 * Central bank to keep rates steady for now
 
(Adds quotes, details, background)
 By Frederik Richter
 MANAMA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Bahrain is facing its worst
unrest since the 1990s and downgrades by rating agencies, but
the Gulf Arab kingdom's central bank governor said on Thursday
he hopes to go forward with a planned $1 billion bond issue.
 Rasheed al-Maraj also said he had not seen major capital
flight after protesters emboldened by popular uprisings in
Tunisia and Egypt took to the streets last week. Seven people
were killed as security forces clamped down.
 ""So far there is no indication of a major capital flight
from the island,"" Maraj told Reuters.
 Major capital outflows could put the country's currency peg
to the U.S. dollar under pressure and become a challenge for the
central bank, whose net foreign assets are at nearly $5 billion.
The small non-OPEC crude producer's central bank said on
Sunday the banking system was working normally and promised all
support to facilitate bank operations in the country, where
nearly $10 billion in mutual funds is parked.
 Before Shi'ite-led protests erupted, the Sunni government
had planned to issue debt by the end of March to cover a rising
fiscal deficit spurred by higher expenditures on social items,
partly to contain public anger.
 ""The plan is still on,"" Maraj said of the bond. ""I think we
need to time it in such a way that we can access the market with
a reasonable level of cost of borrowing.""
 However, the turmoil that has also spread to Libya sent
costs of insuring debt up across the Gulf, while yields on
government bonds rose and stock markets in the world's top oil
exporting region suffered.
 Moreover, Standard & Poor's downgraded the sovereign rating
of Bahrain, a regional financial centre, by one notch to A minus
this week over concerns that the political unrest will persist.
 Moody's put Bahrain on review for possible downgrade, while
Fitch has warned it could cut the sovereign rating.
 Bahrain's five-year credit default swaps have almost doubled
since the unrest gripped much of the Arab world in January to
reach a 20-month peak of 317 points on Wednesday, Markit data
showed.
 
 SPENDING RISE
 The yield on Bahrain's Islamic bond, due in 2014, was at 4.0
percent on Thursday, near its highest levels since last March,
while currency forwards implied roughly 0.5 percent weakening in
the dinar over one year.
 Bahrain planned to spend some $14 billion over the next two
years before the king ordered estimated at least $700 million
more in social spending before protests began.
 But robust oil prices over $100 a barrel, surging on the
regional jitters, are seen helping the stretched budget.
 ""There will be some increase in spending,"" Maraj said. ""On
the other side, we're seeing higher revenues as a result of
higher oil prices. This could offset some of the extra spending
that we are doing.""
 Maraj also said the central bank would maintain its interest
rate policy for now and that it still expected Bahrain's economy
to grow by 4-5 percent this year, adding that it was premature
to estimate the impact of the unrest.
 ""We will maintain our interest rate policy for the time
being. I don't see that we have very much room to go further
down,"" he said.
 The central bank's repo rate, which it uses to inject
liquidity into the system via purchases of deposit certificates
or government bonds, has stood at 2.25 percent since September
2009. The one-week deposit rate is at 0.5 percent.
 The central bank needs to keep its rates near U.S.
benchmarks to avoid pressures on the peg, set at 0.376 to the
dollar.
 Analysts polled by Reuters in December expected Bahrain's
economy, whose financial sector is slowly recovering from
impacts of a regional property crash, to grow by 4.2 percent
this year, after an estimated 3.7 percent rise in 2010.

 * Portugal Telecom margins slip on bad economy, competition
 * European telcos struggle with shrinking revenue, profits
 
 (Adds analyst, link, Portgual Telecom CEO interview)
 By Leila Abboud and Shrikesh Laxmidas
 PARIS/LISBON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Further margin pressure is
in prospect for European telecom operators in 2011 after France
Telecom and Portugal Telecom reported domestic competition
eating into last year's profits.
 Cuts in roaming charges and interconnection fees demanded by
regulators cut into revenues in the home markets of both
operators in 2010, results released on Thursday showed.
 Both have sought growth abroad by buying stakes in emerging
market operators -- France Telecom in the Middle East and
Portugal Telecom in Brazil -- but this hasn't yet been enough to
offset their reliance on former domestic monopolies.
 Robin Bienenstock, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said
that France Telecom and Portugal Telecom faced similar
challenges after years of being sheltered by historically high
prices in their home markets. 
 ""Now they are being hit with the double whammy of
intensifying competition and a macroeconomic downturn,"" she
said. ""Both of them also have question marks over their
international growth stories.""
 France Telecom's 2010 revenue fell 1.4 percent to 45.5
billion euros, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) slipped almost 1 percent
to 15.64 billion. 
 The results, which were largely in line with expectations,
also showed group operating margins down 0.9 percentage points
to 34.4 percent.
 France Telecom's Chief Financial Officer Gervais Pellissier
acknowledged that competition in France was intensifying.
 ""There is still pressure on margins, as the market
anticipates the entry of the fourth mobile operator next year.
We notice a nervousness among the operators in France,""
Pellissier said.
 European telcos are suffering from a growing view of them as
essentially utilities, or defensive investment plays, with low
valuations, high dividend yields, few growth prospects and
decreasing profitability in the coming years.
 Portugal Telecom did not give any guidance for 2011, while
Telecom Italia is due to publish its results later and is also
expected to show weakness at home.
 France Telecom's shares were down 1.45 percent to 15.96
euros, while Portugal Telecom was virtually unchanged at 8.23
euros at 1635 GMT.
 For Portugal Telecom, revenue in 2010 was largely flat at
3.74 billion euro, in line with expectations.
 PT's 2010 operating margins slipped 1.8 percentage points to
39.9 percent from a year earlier, as competition with rivals
picked up in mobile and Portugal's deep economic problems kept a
lid on pricing power as consumers felt the pinch.
 To compensate for these tough conditions, Portugal Telecom
is seeking to expand in growing markets. Last July it agreed a
deal to buy a minority stake in Brazil's main fixed-line phone
carrier Oi for 8.32 billion reais ($4.98 billion).
 Zeinal Bava, CEO of Portugal Telecom, said in a telephone
interview that after the deal, 55 percent of revenues would come
from high-growth areas like Brazil and Africa.
 ""We believe that the Brazilian economy has a very solid
outlook and it will continue to underpin PT's performance in the
future,"" he said.
 New Street Research said it was maintaining a neutral rating
on Portugal Telecom given the tough outlook at home, adding that
a capital increase at Oi in March would be key to determining
the value of Portugal Telecom's stake.
 
 DIVIDEND PLEDGES
 As with other large telecom operators, both France Telecom
and Portugal Telecom proposed generous dividends to their
shareholders for 2010 and promised to continue such pay-outs in
the coming years.
France Telecom, which has an 8.5 percent dividend yield, will
pay 1.40 euros per share for 2010, 2011 and 2012.
 Portugal Telecom also set a regular dividend for 2010 and
2011 at 0.65 euro, and pledged to increase dividend payments a
further 3-5 percent from 2012-2104. 
 It also paid a special dividend in the third quarter of last
year after selling its stake in Brazilian mobile operator Vivo.
 Vivo Participacoes, the country's largest wireless carrier,
said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit more than quadrupled
as it signed more subscribers.
 Vivo, controlled by Spain's Telefonica, said in a securities
filing on Thursday its net profit for the quarter rose to 864.2
million reais from 203 million reais in the last three months of
2009.

 * Move designed to allow small operators to secure supplies
 * Committee approves EU sale of 500,000 T out-of-quota sugar
 
 (Adds details, background)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The European Union has ditched
plans announced on Monday for a reduced-duty tendering process
for sugar imports, in favour of a fixed 300,000-tonne import
quota with duties set at zero, an EU source said on Thursday.
 The EU's executive, the European Commission, told a meeting
of the bloc's sugar management committee that a fixed volume,
duty-free import quota would help smaller EU operators secure
sugar supplies, a source close to the meeting told Reuters.
 The EU currently applies duties of 339 euro per tonne on
imports of raw cane sugar for refining, and 419 euros per tonne
for other raw cane sugar and white sugar.
 Portugal called earlier this week for a zero-duty quota of
500,000 tonnes to enable its refiners to secure supplies of raw
cane sugar from Brazil, after the Commission said it would take
steps to address a shortage of the sweetener on the EU market.
 The Commission initially rejected the request and said a
tender would give it more control over the volumes imported and
prices paid, but changed its plans after countries, including
Britain and Sweden, supported Portugal.
 They argued that a tendering process as originally
announced, with volumes and minimum duties fixed on the basis of
bids from importers, would have benefited larger operators able
to outbid their smaller rivals.
 The new plans must now be formally drafted and adopted by
the Commission before being put to a vote by the committee
within a week or two, the source said.
 
 EU SALES APPROVED
 The committee approved separate plans announced by the
Commission on Monday to sell 500,000 tonnes of EU ""out-of-quota""
sugar on the European consumer market without the usual
""super-levy"" of 500 euros ($688) per tonne, the source said.
 Out-of-quota sugar is excess production above national
quotas, some of which can be exported and the rest sold for
industrial use in Europe such as bioethanol production. It is
normally subject to a the super-levy if sold as food.
 EU in-quota sugar production is currently capped at about
13.9 million tonnes annually, compared with average annual EU
quota consumption of about 16.5 million tonnes and exports of
about 1 to 2 million tonnes.
 The shortfall between EU in-quota sugar production versus
consumption and exports is meant to be filled by EU beginning
stocks and imports.
 But with raw sugar futures recently hitting 30-year highs
and EU duties limiting imports, and stocks at the start of the
2010/11 marketing year at just 561,000 tonnes, the EU is likely
to face a supply shortfall of about 4 million tonnes this year.

(Adds analyst comment)
 By Philip Blenkinsop
 BRUSSELS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment
jumped in February to its highest level since the economic
crisis, but a surge in inflation expectations accompanied
prospects of a rebound of growth in the first quarter.
The European Commission's monthly survey showed on Thursday
that economic sentiment in the 17 countries using the euro rose
to 107.8 this month, a 41-month high, from a revised 106.8 in
January. Economists polled by Reuters expected a 106.8 February
reading.
 Sentiment gained in all sectors of the economy, most
markedly among builders, consumers and in the services sector.
 ""Today's data confirm that an acceleration of GDP growth in
the first quarter of the year is likely after the relatively
poor performance recorded in Q4 2010,"" said Clemente de Lucia,
economist at BNP Paribas.
 ""The index was consistent with GDP growth around 0.7 percent
quarter-on-quarter after 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the
previous quarter,"" de Lucia said.
 Sentiment improved sharply in Poland and Britain, followed
by Spain, Germany and the Netherlands.
 ""We have learned that there is still a great diversion
within the euro area."" said Christoph Weil, European economist
with Commerzbank. ""Spain is rising slightly, but the difference
compared to Germany is still very significant.""
 The Commission survey also showed a sharp increase in
consumer price inflation expectations for the next 12 months,
with the index hitting 25.7 points from 20.9 in January,
significantly above the long-term average since 1990 of 20.6
points.
 Inflation expectations among manufacturers rose to 22.7
points from an upward-revised 17.3 in January, well above the
long-term average of 5.6 points.
 Consumer price inflation in January was 2.4 percent
year-on-year, above the ECB's target of below but close to 2
percent.
 ""What will be worrying the inflationists, so to speak, is
that there were further signs of a pick-up in inflation
expectations,"" said Martin Van Vliet, economist at ING. 
 Economists expect the European Central Bank to hold interest
rates at the record low level of 1 pecent until at least
October, according to a Reuters poll.
 But the ECB's rhetoric about the risks of rising prices has
intensified since the start of the year.
 The separate business climate indicator for the euro zone,
which points to the phase of the business cycle or the level of
economic activity, was revised down to 1.45 in January from a
previous 1.58, and held steady into February.
 This was the highest level since May 2000.
 ""The current level of the indicator is very close to
historical peaks, suggesting that the recovery in industry will
continue in the coming months,"" the Commission said.
 It added that order books, export orders, and production
expectations increased, but this was counterbalanced by lower
production assessments for recent months and the perceptions of
increased stocks of finished goods.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit a record high
against the dollar on Thursday as Middle East tensions stoked
further appreciation in crude oil prices and demand for safe
haven currencies at the broad expense of the greenback.
 Brent crude oil jumped to its highest since August 2008 on
concern unrest that has cut more than a quarter of OPEC-member
Libya's output could spread to other producers including top
exporter Saudi Arabia.
 Major banks warned on Thursday OPEC needs to act quickly to
arrest the oil price rally, which could get out of control and
derail economic recovery should unrest spread beyond Libya to
other major oil nations.
 Worries over Libya, following recent popular uprisings in
Tunisia and Egypt, were helping the Swiss franc and to a lesser
extent the yen, currencies that traders often buy at a time of
uncertainty.
 ""There is a lot of safe haven demand for the Swiss and the
yen but the dollar's downside against these currencies could be
limited because for a lasting trend to arise you need U.S.
Treasury yields to fall relative to Switzerland and Japan,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 The two-year yield spread between U.S. and Switzerland was
holding around 0.14 on Thursday, well within its recent range.

 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell to a record low of
0.9238 franc, its slide having intensified after triggering
stop-loss selling below its previous record low of 0.9301 set at
the end of last year.
 One-month implied dollar/Swiss volatility continued to pick
up, trading around 11.70 percent, but this was still well below
levels of around 15 percent seen around the start of the euro
zone debt crisis in April 2010.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent against the Swiss franc at
1.2762 after sliding to 1.2703, its lowest since Jan. 13.
Against the low yielding yen, the single currency shed around 1
percent on the day to trade at 112.17 yen in early Europe before
bouncing back to 112.80 in volatile trade.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent against the dollar, gaining
support from recent hawkish comments on inflation by European
Central Bank officials which raised expectations the ECB will
hike interest rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve.
 Market players said rising oil prices were leading to
increasing concerns over global growth prospects, but inflation
was still a major focus which could weigh further on the dollar.
 ""It is important to remember weak growth does less damage to
a currency than inflation which is not fought sufficiently by a
central bank. In this respect the euro seems more attractive
than the dollar, as the Fed is still sticking to its QE2
programme,"" said fx analysts at Commerzbank in a note.
 Traders said a break of the euro's year-to-date high around
$1.3861 would be needed to add further momentum to the single
currency's rally.
 
 DOLLAR INDEX HITS THREE-WEEK LOW
 The dollar fell 0.8 percent against the yen to 81.82 yen.
Traders cited dollar-selling by Japanese exporters and model
funds, as well as some liquidation of long dollar positions
established since the beginning of the year.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.5 percent to $1.0075, supported
by data showing Australian business investment rose solidly last
quarter, with spending plans for the next couple of years
exceeding even the most optimistic forecasts.
 The dollar index fell to its lowest in three weeks at
77.011, down 0.4 percent on the day. It was approaching the 2011
low at 76.881, a break of which would take the greenback to
lowest levels since November.

 * Construction, run-down of inventories weigh
 * Data bodes well for growth in first quarter

(Adds details, background) 
 By Soeren Amelang and Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Strong German exports offset a
drop in construction caused by cold winter weather in the fourth
quarter of last year, helping Europe's bulwark economy to
continue growing and putting it on a firm footing for 2011.
 Detailed figures from the Federal Statistics Office on
Thursday confirmed gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.4
percent in the fourth quarter, its seventh quarterly expansion
in a row, but slower than the first three quarters of the year.
 Germany has staged a faster-than-expected recovery from its
deepest post-war recession in 2009. Year-on-year, the economy
grew 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter.
 The data reinforces a twin-speed recovery in Europe with
major north European economies outpacing a struggling,
debt-burdened euro zone periphery, where most austerity measures
to fight the region's debt crisis are set to hit this year.
 However, hopes around Europe that Germany's economic rebound
would broaden and be driven more by consumption growth, boosting
German demand for European goods, were dashed in the fourth
quarter as growth in private consumption slowed.
 Consumption rose 0.7 percent, after a 0.8 percent rise in
the third quarter, adding only 0.1 percentage points to GDP
growth, down from 0.3 percent in the third quarter, according to
the breakdown of GDP data first reported on Feb. 15.
 ""Private consumption was weaker than in previous quarters --
perhaps it was also slowed down by the weather,"" said Andreas
Scheuerle, an economist at Dekabank.
 Exports, the traditional backbone of the German economy,
grew by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, while construction
dropped 3.9 percent, hit by severe winter weather in December.
 ""As expected, the construction industry considerably slowed
growth at the end of 2010. But that should be compensated in the
first quarter,"" said Ulrike Kastens at Sal. Oppenheim.
 ""Strong orders and positive sentiment indicators suggest
(GDP) growth of between 0.8 and 1.0 percent in the first
quarter.""
 Surging oil prices, however, which neared $120 a barrel on
Thursday in the wake of turmoil in Libya, pose a bigger risk to
Germany than to other euro zone economies.
 ""The biggest threat for the German economy currently comes
from oil prices,"" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING.
""Energy and food-driven inflation could choke off the
consumption recovery before it actually gets going. 
 ""Energy-related expenditures in Germany account for a
significantly higher share of total expenditures than in most
other euro zone countries.""
 
 INVENTORIES BODE WELL
 Trade added 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in the
fourth quarter, while construction subtracted 0.4 percentage
points from growth, the same amount as a run-down in
inventories.
 ""In combination with richly filled order books, the second
consecutive negative contribution from inventories bodes well
for growth in the coming quarters as inventory reduction should
only be a temporary phenomenon,"" said Brzeski.
 ""Looking ahead, the first quarter of the year could become
the next growth sensation,"" he added.
 Reflecting this confidence, new economic government adviser
Lars Feld told Reuters this week that Germany's economy would
probably grow by at least 2.5 percent this year and inflation
would not be a problem as long as the European Central Bank
raises interest rates towards year-end.
 Forward-looking indicators have climbed to multi-year highs.
German business morale this month scaled yet another record,
defying spending cuts and slower growth abroad, the Ifo think
tank said on Monday. 
 Germany's budget deficit widened in 2010 to 3.3 percent of
GDP, up from 3.0 percent in 2009 and missing the 3 percent limit
set by the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact. The
government forecasts the deficit will drop to 2.5 percent of GDP
this year.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit a record high
against the dollar on Thursday, with the Japanese yen also
buoyed as Middle East tensions stoked further appreciation in
crude oil prices and demand for safe haven currencies.
 North Sea Brent crude oil futures jumped more than $8 per
barrel as fears spread that unrest across North Africa and the
Middle East could further disrupt oil supplies.
 Worry about political unrest in oil producing Libya,
following recent popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt was
helping the Swiss franc and to a lesser extent the yen,
currencies that traders often buy at a time of uncertainty.
 ""There is a lot of safe haven demand for the Swiss and the
yen but the dollar's downside against these currencies could be
limited because for a lasting trend to arise you need U.S.
Treasury yields to fall relative to Switzerland and Japan,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 The two-year yield spread between U.S. and Switzerland was
holding around 0.15 on Thursday, well within its recent range.

 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell to a record low of
0.9267 franc on trading platform EBS, its slide having
intensified after triggering stop-loss selling below its
previous record low of 0.9301 set at the end of last year.
 The euro was down 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc at
1.2753 after sliding to 1.2703, its lowest since Jan. 13.
Against the low yielding yen, the single currency shed around 1
percent on the day to trade at 112.17 yen in early Europe before
bouncing back to 112.65.
 The euro held firm against the dollar at $1.3760, close to
unchanged on the day, gaining support from recent hawkish
comments on inflation by European Central Bank officials which
raised expectations the ECB will hike interest rates before the
U.S. Federal Reserve.
 ""If the impact from the Middle East crisis is roughly equal
on each currency, you could argue that currencies with a yield
advantage will benefit at the end of the day,"" said Tsutomu
Soma, manager of foreign bonds at Okasan Securities.
 DXY NEAR THREE-WEEK LOW
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent against the yen to 81.95 yen.
Traders cited dollar-selling by Japanese exporters and model
funds, as well as some liquidation of long dollar positions
established since the beginning of the year.
 A support level for the dollar lies near 81.80 yen. That
roughly coincides with the 76.4 percent retracement of the
dollar's rally between early to mid-February and an intraday low
hit on Feb. 8.
 The Australian dollar was steady at $1.0020, supported by
data showing Australian business investment rose solidly last
quarter, with spending plans for the next couple of years
exceeding even the most optimistic forecasts.
 The dollar index fell to its lowest in three weeks in Asia
at 77.144 and was last trading at 77.231, down around 0.2
percent on the day.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices soared more than $8.50
a barrel to hit 29-month highs near $120 on Thursday on fears
that Libya's unrest could spread to other oil-producing states
including top exporter Saudi Arabia, threatening to derail
global growth.
 World stocks and copper prices fell for the fourth straight
day as investors cut their risk exposure, while safe-haven gold
and U.S. Treasury prices rose, and the Swiss franc hit a record
high against the dollar.

 Goldman Sachs said oil markets were driven by fears of
unrest spreading to other producing nations and that another
disruption could create severe oil shortages and require demand
rationing.
 ""The market cannot accommodate another disruption, in our
view, with the problems in Libya potentially absorbing half of
OPEC's spare capacity,"" Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie said in a
research note. [ID:nLDE71N0IB]

exporter Libya has cut at least 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of

calculations. [ID:nLDE71M1RM]
 Brent crude futures  rose 3.4 percent to trade above
$115 a barrel after touching a 29-month high of $119.79, while
U.S. crude futures  advanced 3 percent to above $101 a
barrel.
 The surge in oil prices is threatening to put an end to the
recovery in the developed economies and add further inflationary
pressure in booming emerging countries.
 According to UBS, a $10 increase in oil price will shave off
0.3 percentage points of global growth.

(Adds details, background)
 BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Germany's recovery continued in
the last quarter of 2010, with exports offsetting weaker
construction in cold winter weather and a run-down of
inventories, putting Europe's bulwark economy on a firm footing
going into 2011.
 Detailed figures from the Federal Statistics Office on
Thursday confirmed gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.4
percent in the fourth quarter, its seventh quarterly expansion
in a row, but slowing from the first three quarters of the year.
 Germany has staged a faster-than-expected recovery and
outpaced its European peers since emerging from its deepest
post-war recession in 2009. Year-on-year, the economy grew 4.0
percent compared to the last three months of 2009.
 Trade added 0.7 percentage points to GDP in Europe's largest
economy, said the statistics office, which gave a breakdown of
quarterly growth data that it first reported on Feb. 15.
 Construction subtracted 0.4 percentage points from GDP, the
same amount as a run-down in inventories.
 ""As expected, construction industry considerably slowed
growth at the end of 2010. But that should be compensated in the
first quarter,"" said Ulrike Kastens at Sal. Oppenheim.
 ""Strong orders and positive sentiment indicators suggest
growth of between 0.8 and 1.0 percent in the first quarter.""
 Forward-looking indicators have climbed to multi-year highs.
German business morale this month scaled yet another record
high, defying spending cuts and slower growth abroad, the Ifo
think tank said on Monday.
 Purchasing managers' surveys also signalled record growth in
manufacturing is powering a strong expansion of the private
sector. [ID:nLDE71K0YV]

(Updates with detail)
 MADRID, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Spain's largest oil company
Repsol met analysts estimates on Thursday with a doubling of
adjusted fourth quarter net profit thanks to higher oil prices
and refining margins.
 Repsol's refining margins in its core Spanish markets rose
to $2.9 per barrel from zero in the fourth quarter of 2009,
while its oil fetched 16 percent more year on year.
 Net debt at the company fell by over a third in the fourth
quarter to 7.22 billion, helped by the sale of assets in Brazil,
mainly a stake in its upstream operations to China's Sinopec in
October.
 Repsol's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (CCS
adjusted EBIT) increased 41 percent to 1.06 billion euros.
 Repsol's fourth quarter earnings were also driven by
capacity hikes in liquid natural gas from a new plant in Peru,
which together with a modest recovery in gas prices boosted the
group's LNG division.
 A Reuters poll of 10 analysts saw Repsol's fourth quarter
net profit adjusted for one-time gains and inventory effects
(CCS adj net) increasing 100 percent to 483 million euros
($661.7 million), on a 41 percent increase in CCS adjusted
operating profit to 1.06 billion euros.
 Repsol will hold a press conference at 1030 GMT when it is
expected to field questions on losses due to the stoppage of its
operations in Libya.
 Repsol's oil flows in the North African country account for
3.8 percent of the company's total production and were suspended
on Tuesday.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Unrest in Libya and the threat of
contagion to other oil producing countries in the region drove
Brent crude to a 29-month high above $113 on Thursday, fuelling
worries about slower global growth and knocking Asian shares
lower.	
 Copper hovered near a one-month low and the dollar stayed on
the back foot amid worries that the U.S. economy would be
especially vulnerable to high oil prices, given its reliance on
consumer spending to drive growth.	
 World leaders condemned Muammar Gaddafi's bloody crackdown
on a revolt that has split Libya, but took little action to halt
the bloodshed from the latest upheaval reshaping the Arab world.
.	
 Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1.2 percent, while
stocks elsewhere in Asia shed 0.6 percent,
having earlier risen as much as 0.4 percent.	
 ""Investors knew all along that a correction was on its way
after the rally, and the turmoil in Libya gave the market a good
opportunity to enter one,"" Makoto Kikuchi, CEO at Myojo Asset
Management Japan, said about Tokyo stocks.	
 
 London Brent crude jumped $2.55 to as high as
$113.80 a barrel, for the first time since September 2008,
having gained nearly 10 percent in the past four sessions. U.S.
crude last traded at around $99 a barrel, a whisker away
from Wednesday's high of $100.	
 ""I see more upside on Brent for the moment with prices
likely to hit $120 by the end of March,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a
commodity derivatives manager at Newedge brokerage in Tokyo.	
 Other Asian stock markets showed signs of stabilising after
two straight sessions of losses, but the general mood remained
one of caution as investors worry that higher energy prices will
hurt corporate profits and add to global inflationary pressures.	
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index fell 0.8 percent,
South Korea's KOSPI slipped 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's
Hang Seng was little changed and China's Shanghai
Composite Index edged up 0.2 percent. 
 Modest gains in U.S. stock index futures suggested a
steadier start on Wall Street after two sessions of falls.	
 Gold , a traditional safe haven in times of trouble,
traded at around $1,410 an ounce, not far from a record high
around $1,430 set in December. 
 Copper erased early gains to be down 0.2 percent at
$9,407 a tonne, near a one-month low of $9,365 plumbed on
Wednesday.	
 
 DOLLAR STRUGGLES	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, shed 0.2 percent to
77.271.	
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell to a record low at
around 0.9275 franc , surpassing the previous trough of
0.9301 set at the end of the year.	
 Investors will also be eyeing a slew of U.S. data due later
in the day, including retail sales and home sales, for clues on
the pace of growth in the economy.	
 The euro held firm at $1.3762 , coming within easy
reach of its Feb. 2 peak of $1.3862, helped also by recent
hawkish comments on inflation by European Central Bank
officials.	
 This has raised expectations the ECB will hike interest
rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve.	
 Meanwhile, the New Zealand dollar stayed near
two-month lows below $0.7500, with markets now pricing in an 88
percent chance that the next rate move will be a 25 basis point
cut .	
 The move followed the deadly earthquake that hit the
country's second biggest city of Christchurch on Tuesday.

 By Adrian Bathgate	
 CHRISTCHURCH, Feb 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand rescuers said
on Thursday they held grave fears for more than 200 people still
missing as the death toll from an earthquake reached 98 after
searchers pulled dozens of bodies from a Christchurch television
building now turned into a tomb.	
 Teams from quake-prone countries such as Japan and the
United States sent in sniffer dogs and lowered microphones into
piles of rubble to probe for signs of life, two days after a 6.3
magnitude quake struck the country's second-biggest city.	
 ""It's a dreadful, dreadful day, it's a hard day for the
search and rescue people because everybody is full of hope we
can find people in the rubble,"" said city Mayor Bob Parker as
rescue teams failed to find any sign of life.	
 Instead, the smouldering ruin of the former Canterbury
Television (CTV) building, which was also home to an English
school for foreign students, appeared to have become a charnel
house, with 47 bodies pulled from the rubble and many more
thought still to be inside.	
 ""Every few hours we stop and do a technical search just in
case, but being realistic, based on what we've seen so far,
we're not going to be seeing anyone alive coming out of that
space,"" said fire rescue chief Jim Stuart Black.

FACTBOX-New Zealand's biggest quakes 
 
 The efforts of rescuers were hindered by the prospect of new
collapses of damaged buildings, with most fears focused on a
teetering 26-storey hotel tower.	
 Local police commander Dave Cliff said the death toll stood
at 98 and expressed grave concern for 226 known still to be
missing. Two infants of five and nine months were among the
dead.	
 Teams rushed to a small church after it was believed that a
woman's voice had been heard -- apparently the first sign in
more than 15 hours that people might still be alive. It turned
out to be another false hope.	
 Prime Minister John Key said the death toll was certain to
rise, possibly dramatically.	
 ""We are very concerned that the death toll may rise much
more rapidly than any of us had ever feared,"" he said. ""Frankly
it looks like a war zone from a helicopter. It's building after
building after building that's collapsed.""	
 The worst fears centred on the six-story television
building, which was thought to be the deadliest single collapse
with up to 120 people inside, including many missing Japanese
students, caught as levels pancaked on to one another.	
 A newly arrived Japanese rescue team headed straight for the
ruin, with around 30 of them in orange and blue overalls
clambering over rubble with sniffer dogs.	
 
 HOTEL AT RISK	
 ""We have a big team and we are determined to help,"" Kai
Jinnai told Reuters. ""While we are here we are going to do our
very best.""	
 In Japan, chief cabinet spokesman Yukio Edano said 27
Japanese were still missing in the South Island city, with many
of those from the building's King's Education school.	
 Rescuers faced the risk that a nearby 26-storey hotel could
topple at any moment and trigger collapses among other damaged
buildings. The Grand Chancellor Hotel was already leaning badly.	
 ""It's incredibly dangerous...if it hits the ground it will
create a significant shock wave,"" Mayor Parker said.	
 Cliff said up to 22 bodies were believed to be trapped in
the rubble of the city's stone cathedral, where the spire had
toppled on to a square. 
 Most rescue operations have focused on the central business
district, which bore the brunt of the quake on Tuesday when
streets and shops were filled with lunchtime crowds.	
 More than 100 aftershocks have brought down more debris.
Roads have buckled and large pools of water have welled up from
broken pipes and sewers. 
 In places, roads had collapsed into a milky, sand-coloured
lake beneath the surface, the result of Christchurch's sandy
foundations mixing with subterranean water under the force of
the quake. Officials call it ""liquefaction"" of the ground. 
Investment bank J.P. Morgan estimates the quake could
cost insurers $12 billion, while catastrophe modelling firm AIR
Worldwide Estimates says the insurance industry faces claims of
NZ$5 billion ($3.5 billion) to NZ$11.5 billion ($8 billion).	
 Officials said fresh teams from Japan, Taiwan, Australia,
Singapore and the United States would allow for an expanded
search of three square km littered with flattened buildings.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Unrest in Libya and the threat of
contagion to other oil producing countries in the region drove
Brent crude to $113 a barrel on Thursday, but the selloff in
Asian stocks eased as investors started to nibble at beaten-down
shares.	
 Copper also bounced off one-month lows, although the
dollar stayed on the back foot as some investors worry that the
U.S. economy would be vulnerable to high oil prices, given its
reliance on consumer spending to drive growth.	
 London Brent crude rose as high as $113 a barrel for
the first time since September 2008, having gained nearly 10
percent in the past four sessions. U.S. crude last traded
at around $99.38 a barrel, a whisker away from Wednesday's high
of $100.	
 
 Worries that higher energy prices will crimp corporate
profits had sparked a steep selloff in Asian stocks in the past
two sessions, but that looked to be losing its punch.	
 Japan's Nikkei 225 index , while still 0.4 percent
lower on the day, was off its lows and stocks elsewhere in Asia
erased early losses to be up 0.4 percent.	
 ""As Japanese stocks have tumbled for the past two sessions
(losing 2.6 percent), today's losses may not be sharp,"" said
Masumi Yamamoto, a market analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital
Markets. 
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng put on 0.2 percent and China's
Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.2 percent. Gains in
U.S. stock futures suggest a steadier start on Wall
Street after two sessions of declines.	
 Gold , a traditional safe haven in times of trouble,
traded at around $1,412 an ounce, not far from a record high
around $1,430 set in December. 
 Copper gained 1.1 percent to $9,526 a tonne,
climbing off a one-month low of $9,365.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, shed 0.3 percent to
77.173.	
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell to a record low at
around 0.9277 franc , surpassing the previous trough of
0.9301 set at the end of the year.	
 The euro held firm at $1.3776 , coming within easy
reach of its Feb. 2 peak of $1.3862, helped also by recent
hawkish comments on inflation by European Central Bank
officials, which raised expectations the ECB will hike interest
rates before the Federal Reserve.	
 ""There may be a realisation that if oil prices rise sharply,
that would hit all the developed countries and in that sense it
effects every major currency the same,"" said Tsutomu Soma,
manager of foreign bonds at Okasan Securities. 
""And if the impact from the Middle East crisis is roughly
equal on each currency, you could argue that currencies with a
yield advantage will benefit at the end of the day,"" Soma said. 
 The New Zealand dollar continued to struggle at
two-month lows below $0.7500, with markets now pricing in an 88
percent chance that the next rate move will be a 25 basis point
cut .	
 The move followed the deadly earthquake that hit the
country's second biggest city of Christchurch on Tuesday.

 * Euro, sterling helped by rate hike expectations
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit a record high
against the dollar while the U.S. currency came under broad
pressure on Thursday on fears that social unrest could spread in
the oil-producing and diplomatically volatile Middle East.
 Traders said the dollar appeared to be losing its safe-haven
lustre while the euro and the pound drew support from
expectations their interest rate advantage could rise further
later this year.
 ""There may be a realisation that if oil prices rise sharply,
that would hit all the developed countries and in that sense it
effects every major currency the same,"" said Tsutomu Soma,
manager of foreign bonds at Okasan Securities.
 ""And if the impact from the Middle East crisis is roughly
equal on each currency, you could argue that currencies with a
yield advantage will benefit at the end of the day,"" Soma said.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell to a record low of
0.9292 franc, breaking below its previous low of 0.9301 set at
the end of last year.
 Worry about tension in the Middle East is helping the Swiss
franc, as currency market players buy at time of uncertainty.
 ""There is no end in sight in the revolts and democratic
movements from North Africa. This is likely to spread to other
regions,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp.
 Traders fret that unrest could spread to bigger oil producers
than Libya, such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia, which would be
certain to disrupt oil supplies and harm the global economy.
 The euro held firm at $1.3763, up 0.1 percent from late U.S.
levels, coming within less than a full cent from its Feb. 2 peak
of $1.3862. The euro rose as high as $1.3787 on Wednesday.
 Recent hawkish comments on inflation by European Central
Bank officials have raised expectations the ECB will hike
interest rates before the Federal Reserve.
 By contrast, Fed fund futures have been on the
rise since early last week as investors push back the expected
timing of the Fed's lifting of interest rates from the current
range of zero to 0.25 percent.
 The British pound moved closer to its recent peak of $1.6279
hit on Feb. 3 and more importantly $1.6300 hit in November, a
break of which could signal a departure from its trading range of
the past few months.
 Sterling traded at $1.6221 in early Asian trade, after having
risen as high as $1.6275 on Wednesday after Bank of England
minutes showed one more policymaker voted for an interest rate
rise this month,
 That cemented expectations that the bank will raise rates by
June.
 The dollar's index against a basket of major currencies fell
to at 77.233, its lowest in three weeks and edging closer to its
Feb. 2 trough of 76.881.
 SMBC's Uno, who has forecast the dollar will fall sharply
this year because of a decline in U.S. hegemony, said the
dollar's fall in the face of rising instability in the Middle
East is no surprise.
 He said the passage of Iranian naval ships through Egypt's
Suez Canal signalled a change in the balance of power in the
region, and the deterrent power of the United States appeared to
be falling.
 ""The United States, the centre of the world, is wobbling and
that leads directly to a fall in the dollar,"" he said.

 * Asian stocks pressured, but copper bounces off lows
 * NZD struggles as markets price rate cut risk after
Tuesday's quake

 SYDNEY, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Unrest in Libya and the threat of
contagion to other oil producers in the region kept U.S. crude
near $100 a barrel in Asia on Thursday, fuelling fears that
global growth may suffer and keeping stocks under pressure.	
 But there were some signs that investors may be starting to
return with base metal prices such as copper bouncing
off one-month lows.	
 The dollar stayed on the back foot as some investors worry
that the U.S. economy would be vulnerable to high oil prices,
given its reliance on consumer spending to drive growth.	
 U.S. crude last traded at around $99.08 a barrel,
having hit $100 a barrel for the first time since October 2008.
Brent crude rose 90 cents to $112.15 a barrel, remaining
at highs not seen since late 2008.	
 
 Investors, fearing that higher energy prices will hit
corporate profits, also avoided stocks. Japan's Nikkei 225 index
fell 0.9 percent, while stocks elsewhere in Asia
slipped 0.2 percent.	
 ""As Japanese stocks have tumbled for the past two sessions
(losing 2.6 percent), today's losses may not be
sharp,"" said Masumi Yamamoto, a market analyst at Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets. 
 Gold , a traditional safe haven in times of trouble,
traded at around $1,414 an ounce, not far from a record high
around $1,430 set in December. Copper gained 1.1 percent
to $9,530.75 a tonne, climbing off a one-month low of $9,365.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, shed 0.3 percent to
77.198.	
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 82.24 yen , while the
euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.3776. 
 The New Zealand dollar continued to struggle at
two-month lows around $0.7465, with markets now pricing in an 88
percent chance that the next rate move will be a 25 basis point
cut .	
 The move followed the deadly earthquake that hit the
country's second biggest city of Christchurch on Tuesday.

 * WTO's Lamy fears Doha talks bogging down again
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - U.S. exports to India,
Brazil and other fast-growing emerging markets could remain
relatively flat in the absence of a new world trade deal, the
White House said on Wednesday in its annual economic report.
 ""A key item on the administration's trade agenda is
therefore continued work to open these markets through the Doha
Round of WTO (World Trade Organization) negotiations,"" the
report said in a section looking at the world economy.
 The analysis of how the United States could benefit from a
new world trade deal follows WTO Director General Pascal Lamy's
complaint on Tuesday that efforts to finally finish the
nine-year-old talks were proceeding too slowly to meet an
end-of-the-year deadline.
 That has raised concern the negotiations could collapse
again and remain stalemated until after the next U.S.
presidential election in late 2012.
 President Barack Obama is expected to discuss the vexed
talks with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff when he visits
the country next month.
 Last week, Brazil's Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota said
the United States was making unreasonable demands on developing
countries for more market-opening concessions.
 The White House report noted India, Brazil and China have
all cut import tariffs significantly over the past 20 years but
said they remain high compared to the United States.
 Brazil's average applied tariff is 13.6 percent, India's is
13.0 percent and China's is 9.6 percent. Those compare to 3.5
percent for the United States, 5.6 percent for the European
Union and 5.4 percent for Japan, the report said.
 Another measure used by the World Bank evaluates a
country's ""overall trade restrictiveness,"" with a higher number
reflecting a more restrictive trade policy.
 On this index, Brazil's score is 20.3, India's score is
18.0 and China's is 9.8. The United States' score is 6.3, the
EU's is 6.4 and Japan's is 11.3, the report said.
The share of U.S. exports going to Brazil, India and a
number of other emerging economies has leveled off since the
mid-1990s, when some of the countries went through an initial
phase of trade liberalization, the White House said.
 The prospect for future export growth to those countries
depends at least partly on how much further they are willing to
cut tariff and nontariff barriers, the report said.
 In contrast to Brazil and India, China has risen over the
past decade to the fourth largest destination for U.S. exports
behind the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
 In 2000, only about 2 percent of U.S. exports went to
China, the report said.

 By Adrian Bathgate	
 CHRISTCHURCH, Feb 24 (Reuters) - International rescuers
intensified their search for earthquake survivors in New Zealand
on Thursday, despite fading hopes of finding any more people
alive and fears a damaged 26-storey hotel tower could collapse
and trigger a new disaster.	
 Teams from quake-prone countries such as Japan and the
United States sent in sniffer dogs and lowered microphones into
rubble to probe for signs of life, two days after a 6.3
magnitude quake struck the tourist city of Christchurch.	
 New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said the death toll had
now climbed to 92 and suggested the numbers could rise
considerably. There were grave fears, he said, for about 200
people still missing.	
 Search teams said their aim remained to rescue those trapped
but advised caution.	
 ""It remains a rescue operation. There could be people alive,
we don't know,"" Canterbury province police commander Dave Cliff
told reporters.	
 Teams rushed to a small church after it was believed that a
woman's voice had been heard -- apparently the first sign in
more than 15 hours that people might still be alive. It turned
out to be another false hope.	
 ""Right now we do not have any active contact with any person
or any indication of signs of life at any location we are
working at,"" fire rescue coordinator Jim Stuart Black said.

FACTBOX-New Zealand's biggest quakes 
 
 Key said the death toll was certain to worsen.	
 ""The indications we're getting from the police ... Is that
the the loss of life could be more substantial than anyone of us
had ever dreamed of,"" he told Sky News television.	
 ""They've been in touch with a couple of hundred families who
have clearly indicated that they have a loved one missing and
police have every reason to believe those people may be
fatalities.""	
 Hopes faded by the hour, but there was renewed activity at
what was feared to be the deadliest single collapse -- a
six-storey building where up to 120 people, including many
missing Japanese students, are feared buried.	
 A newly-arrived Japanese rescue team headed straight for the
smouldering ruin of the Canterbury Television (CTV) building.
Around 30 of them, in orange and blue overalls, clambered over
rubble which also housed a third-floor English-language school.	
 Other rescuers carried out bodies. Officials brought
additional body bags.	
 ""We have a big team and we are determined to help,"" Kai
Jinnai told Reuters. ""...While we are here we are going to do
our very best.""	
 In Japan, chief cabinet spokesman Edano said 27 Japanese
were still missing in the South Island city, with many of those
from the King's Education school in the CTV building.	
 
 DEATH TOLL TO CLIMB	
 Rescuers faced the risk that a nearby 26-storey hotel could
topple at any moment and trigger collapses among other damaged
buildings. The Grand Chancellor Hotel was already leaning badly.	
 ""It's incredibly dangerous...if it hits the ground it will
create a significant shock wave,"" Mayor Bob Parker said.	
 Rescue teams had worked through a second night under
floodlights, but found only bodies. They still hoped for a
miracle, along with distraught onlookers awaiting news.	
 ""Miracles happen and we're keeping that in the forefront of
our minds. That sort of things drives you and pushes you on,""
rescue official Keith Norton said.	
 The last rescue was of a woman, Ann Bodkin, from a finance
company building mid-afternoon on Wednesday. 
 Around 2,500 people had been injured, 164 seriously.	
 Cliff said up to 22 bodies were believed to be trapped in
the rubble of the city's stone cathedral, where the spire had
toppled onto a square normally crowded with tourists.	
 
 MORE THAN 100 AFTERSHOCKS	
 Rescue operations have focused on the central business
district, which bore the brunt of the quake on Tuesday afternoon
when streets and shops were filled with lunchtime crowds.	
 More than 100 aftershocks have brought down more debris.
Roads have buckled and large pools of water have welled up from
broken pipes and sewers. 
 In places, roads had collapsed into a milky, sand-coloured
lake beneath the surface, the result of Christchurch's sandy
foundations mixing with subterranean water under the force of
the quake. Officials call it ""liquefaction"" of the ground. 
Investment bank J.P. Morgan estimates the quake could
cost insurers $12 billion, while catastrophe modelling firm AIR
Worldwide Estimates says the insurance industry faces claims of
NZ$5 billion ($3.5 billion) to NZ$11.5 billion ($8 billion).
   The quake could end up being the costliest disaster for the
global insurance industry in nearly three years. It is not
expected to be enough, however, to arrest a sharp multiyear
decline in insurance and reinsurance pricing.	
 Key has been cautious on damage estimates, but said the
country could afford to rebuild the city. The prime minister on
Thursday reshuffled his cabinet to allow a senior minister to
focus on the country's worst natural disaster in 80 years.	
 Officials said fresh teams from Japan, Taiwan, Australia,
Singapore and the United States would allow for an expanded
search of three square km littered with flattened buildings.	
 More than 1,000 workers were expected to comb though
shattered buildings, with the city divided into search grids.	
 Deputy task force commander Peter Dawson said finding more
survivors would depend on the fitness of people trapped and the
conditions of the collapsed spaces inside buildings.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc edged toward a
record high on Wednesday as turmoil in Libya drove investors to
seek safety, while the U.S. dollar fell broadly as the
greenback appeared to lose its safe-haven luster.
 The euro, which for sometime was treated as a risk
currency, rose as investors seeking safety shunned the dollar.
Expectations that interest rates will rise faster in the euro
zone than in the United States helped boost the single
currency.
 Stocks markets fell worldwide after political violence in
Libya sent U.S. oil futures to $100 a barrel, fanning concern
about inflation and its impact on the global economy.
 ""The theme is basically dollar selling on fears that (the
unrest) in Libya could expand,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
""The dollar at the moment is not enjoying any kind of
safe-haven respite.""
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.5
percent at 77.383, after falling as low as 77.255, a near
three-week trough.
 The euro hit a session peak of $1.3787 on trading platform
EBS, with gains accelerating after it took out resistance
around $1.3745, the Feb. 9 high. It was last up 0.7 percent to
$1.3748. The next key upside target lies at $1.3862, the
February high, traders said.
 Recent hawkish comments on inflation from European Central
Bank officials have raised expectations the ECB would hike
interest rates before the Federal Reserve.
 By contrast, U.S. Fed fund futures have been on the rise
since early last week as investors push back the expected
timing of the Fed's lifting of interest rates from the current
range of zero to 0.25 percent.
 Also weighing on sentiment about the dollar, analysts said,
were growing worries about the country's ballooning budget
deficit.
 The federal government will run out of money for
non-essential operations if the Democrats and Republicans fail
to agree on funding by the end of next week, which could
unsettle financial markets and risk mass government layoffs.
 ""There's increasing concern over the U.S. fiscal
situation,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director of Faros
Trading LLC in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The dollar has ""lost its 'flight-to-quality' status,"" he
said. ""When there are issues of anxiety in the world, people
are now buying the euro rather than buying the dollar.""
 Borthwick said his firm's latest weekly poll on market
positions for macro funds and real money funds showed
""significant moves out of the U.S. dollar and into the Swiss
franc and euro.""
 The euro VIX index, a measure of the currency's volatility
traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, earlier reached
11.93 percent, suggesting the expectation of more movements.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell 0.5 percent to
0.9335, after earlier touching 0.9307, the lowest this year and
near the all-time low of 0.9301 set in December. Risk
aversion also lifted the yen, although higher oil prices kept a
lid on gains, with the Japanese economy vulnerable due to high
oil imports. The dollar last traded down 0.3 percent at 82.47
yen.

 * Rules could hit future EU oil imports from Canada
 * Ottawa does see impact of rules on timing of trade talks
 By Allan Dowd
 VANCOUVER, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Canada is concerned about
possible European import restrictions on crude from its vast
oil sands, but a fight over the industry's emissions will not
have an impact on trade talks with the European Union, Ottawa's
Trade Minister said on Wednesday.
 Peter Van Loan denied reports by EU sources that Canada has
threatened to scrap a proposed multibillion-dollar free trade
deal if Europe goes ahead with new rules to promote greener,
low-carbon fuels as part of a strategy to curb greenhouse gas
emissions. [ID:nLDE71F21W] [ID:nLDE71H14V]
 Europe's trade and climate chiefs are preparing to take a
stand against imports of oil from Canada's tar sands, a major
source of greenhouse gases, despite fears that two-way trade
would suffer as a result, according to EU sources and
documents.
 ""This issue is being dealt with separately from the free
trade discussions, so I do not anticipate it will have an
impact on the timing or the outcome of those free trade talks,""
Van Loan said in Vancouver
 ""That said, we are very concerned about the proposed fuel
quality initiative of the European Union,"" Van Loan said.
 European officials had backed away from the fuel plan last
year, but have now decided to move forward again after checking
the methods used to measure the carbon footprint of various
fuels, according to internal EU documents and sources.
 Environmentalists say using crude from the oil sands has an
increased impact on the climate because of the amount of energy
needed to extract the tar-like oil from the sediment -- a claim
the energy industry disputes as being outdated.
 Van Loan reiterated Ottawa's position that the science does
not support restrictions on crude from the oil sands of
northern Alberta, the second largest proven oil reserves after
Saudi Arabia.
 ""I think you can only look around the world today to
recognize the value of Canada's supply of oil to the world as a
a stable democratic and reliable country of origin,"" Van Loan
said.
 The United States is now the only country to import crude
from the oil sands, which are usually referred to by the
government and oil industry as the ""oil sands"" but which
environmental groups label ""tar sands.""
 Canada is the largest energy supplier to the United States,
but has been looking to expand the market for its crude to
China and Europe in the future.
 EU officials have said they expect Ottawa will challenge
any import restrictions to the World Trade Organization.
 Canada and the EU are looking to strike a free trade deal
by the end of 2011. Although two-way trade is relatively small,
totaling around C$82 billion ($83 billion) in 2010, a deal with
the EU would be a major breakthrough for Canada as it seeks to
diversify export markets in the face of weaker U.S. demand for
its products.

 * Global imbalances causing tension in exchange rates
(Recasts lead, adds more details)
 By Caren Bohan and Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday
said higher oil prices caused by Middle East unrest must be
monitored but would not stall the U.S. recovery, while
reiterating a warning on the risks posed by global imbalances.
 ""Thus far, they're up, but we're not forecasting -- and you
haven't seen the private forecasters forecasting -- that at
these levels they would derail the recovery,"" said top White
House economist Austan Goolsbee.
 U.S. crude oil reached a 28-month high of $100 a barrel on
Wednesday as violence in OPEC producer Libya caused output
there to be reduced and investors bet that unrest elsewhere in
the region could cause additional disruption to supplies.
 Goolsbee was answering a reporter's question during remarks
on the annual Economic Report of the President, which takes a
broad look at the outlook for the U.S. and global economy.
 Oil's steady climb in recent weeks as popular revolts
toppled autocratic leaders in Tunisia and Egypt, while sparking
massed demonstrations elsewhere in the Arab world, has
unsettled stock markets and applied a potential brake to growth
in the United States and other oil-importing economies.
 ""We continue to monitor events of the Middle East and the
fuel markets because they do have a negative impact. High fuel
costs have a negative impact on the economy,"" Goolsbee said.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 107.01 points,
or 0.88 percent, on Wednesday and traders blamed part of those
losses on concern over the rise in oil.
 Higher fuel prices act as a tax on U.S. households and
businesses, crimping spending and potentially denting demand
that could sap growth and hiring, which are slowly improving as
the country recovers from the severe 2007-2009 recession.
 The president's report focused in part on the risk the
United States faces from instability caused by ongoing global
imbalances -- a coded reference to the massive trade surplus
that China runs with the United States.
 This has been a steady argument by U.S. officials at recent
meetings of the Group of 20 industrial nations, where they have
argued for emerging economies like China to do more to boost
their own domestic demand as the United States lifts exports.
The president's report repeated this point.
 ""The world economy, however, must not only recover but also
shift away from its pre-crisis pattern of growth that was too
dependent on U.S. consumption,"" the report said.
 The report, prepared by the White House Council of Economic
Advisers, said it was not surprising that advanced economies
were growing more slowly than emerging ones because that is
part of a normal pattern, but it said the current gap is
""unusually large.""
 Listing challenges to global growth, the report mentioned
still-high unemployment rates and high fiscal deficits in
developed countries.
 It also noted that inflation was rising in some emerging
economies, including China, and that the contrasting trends
were putting pressure on exchange rates and money flows.
 ""The contrast between fast growth with rising interest
rates in the emerging world and slower growth with lower
interest rates in advanced economies has put pressure on
capital flows and exchange rates,"" the White House said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc edged toward a
record high on Wednesday as turmoil in Libya drove investors to
seek safety, while the U.S. dollar fell broadly as the
greenback appeared to lose its safe-haven luster.
 The euro, which for sometime was treated as a risk
currency, rose as investors seeking safety shunned the dollar.
Expectations that interest rates will rise faster in the euro
zone than in the United States helped boost the single
currency.
 Stocks markets fell worldwide after political violence in
Libya sent U.S. oil futures to $100 a barrel, fanning concern
about inflation and its impact on the global economy.
 ""The theme is basically dollar selling on fears that (the
unrest) in Libya could expand,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
""The dollar at the moment is not enjoying any kind of
safe-haven respite.""
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar <.DXY> was down
0.5 percent at 77.407, after falling as low as 77.255, a near
three-week trough.
 The euro hit a session peak of $1.3787  on trading
platform EBS, with gains accelerating after it took out
resistance around $1.3745, the Feb. 9 high. It was last up 0.7
percent to $1.3745. The next key upside target lies at $1.3862,
the February high, traders said.
 Recent hawkish comments on inflation from European Central
Bank officials have raised expectations the ECB would hike
interest rates before the Federal Reserve.
 By contrast, U.S. Fed fund futures <#FF:> have been on the
rise since early last week as investors push back the expected
timing of the Fed's lifting of interest rates from the current
range of zero to 0.25 percent. See [ID:nN23288858]

 DOLLAR NO LONGER SAFE?
 Also weighing on sentiment about the dollar, analysts said,
were growing worries about the country's ballooning budget
deficit.
 The federal government will run out of money for
non-essential operations if the Democrats and Republicans fail
to agree on funding by the end of next week, which could
unsettle financial markets and risk mass government layoffs.
See [ID:nN22281146]
 ""There's increasing concern over the U.S. fiscal
situation,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director of Faros
Trading LLC in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The dollar has ""lost its flight-to-quality status,"" he
said. ""When there are issues of anxiety in the world, people
are now buying the euro rather than buying the dollar.""
 Borthwick said his firm's latest weekly poll on market
positions for macro funds and real money funds showed
""significant moves out of the U.S. dollar and into the Swiss
franc and euro.""
 The euro VIX index <.EVZ>, a measure of the currency's
volatility traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, spiked
to 11.93 percent on Wednesday from 11.27 percent on Tuesday,
suggesting the expectation of more movements.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell 0.5 percent to
0.9337 franc , after earlier touching 0.9307 franc,
the lowest this year and near the all-time low of 0.9301 set in
December.
 Risk aversion also lifted the yen, although higher oil
prices kept a lid on gains, with the Japanese economy
vulnerable due to high oil imports. The dollar last traded down
0.3 percent at 82.54 yen .

 NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc edged toward a
record high on Wednesday as turmoil in Libya and soaring oil
prices drove investors to seek safety, while the U.S. dollar
fell broadly as the greenback appeared to lose its safe-haven
luster.
 The euro, which for sometime was treated as a risk

shunned the dollar.
 The euro hit a session peak of $1.3787 on trading platform

has to do with the higher oil and gold prices.""
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.5
percent at 77.358, after falling as low as 77.255, a near
three-week trough.
 Stocks markets fell worldwide as investors fled riskier
investments and sought safety in gold, U.S. Treasuries, the
Swiss franc and the yen. The U.S. currency was sold across the
board, fueling speculation the greenback may have lost its
safe-haven appeal.
 ""When there are issues of anxiety in the world, people are

 In midday trading, the euro was up 0.7 percent at $1.3746.
Market players said the euro was also supported by earlier
buying by Asian central banks and by real money selling of
dollars following a drop in U.S. Treasury yields the previous
day.
 The euro VIX index, a measure of the currency's volatility

 NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - World stocks slid further from
recent 30-month highs on Wednesday as political violence in
Libya drove up crude oil prices while fanning concerns about
inflation and its impact on global economic growth.
 Stocks slipped on Wall Street a day after their worst
session since August as fears that unrest in Libya could spread
to other oil-producing nations in the region and choke off
exports pushed safe-haven government debt higher.
 Brent crude futures in London climbed above $110 a barrel

 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $2.20 to $97.62 a
barrel, and Brent  rose $4.23 to $110.01.
 ""If we lose Libyan production, then you will have to
replace around 1.6 million barrels per day of very good quality
crude, which would introduce logistical implications and have a
cost,"" said Credit Agricole CIB analyst Christophe Barret.
 Traders said prospects of higher inflation and interest
rates took center stage in currency markets, pushing aside
concerns about political tensions in North Africa.

 * Could affect EFSF, tie Merkel's hands at summit - analysts
 
(Recasts, updates with comment, background)
 By Erik Kirschbaum and Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Germany's government will take
note of domestic pressure to rule out bond buybacks by the euro
zone's permanent rescue fund, signalling it could take a hard
line in crunch talks on the crisis next month.
 MPs from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats
(CDU) and her coalition partners approved a motion on Tuesday,
seeking to ban buybacks by the European Stabilisation Mechanism
(ESM) when it replaces the temporary EFSF fund in 2013.
 Though non-binding, government spokesman Christoph Steegmans
told a news conference the resolution had been
""closely-coordinated"" with government officials.
 ""You can assume that there was close coordination between
the parliamentary groups and members of the government,""
Steegmans. ""And there will be (further coordination) as far as
the further progress of negotiations in Europe are concerned.""
 Merkel has long been dragging her heels on agreeing to boost
the scope and size of the bailout fund. 
 Fears of further election defeats in Germany, after her CDU
party was routed in Hamburg at the weekend, has added to
pressure for her not to underwrite the debts of the euro zone's
struggling periphery.
 While not explicitly ruling out buybacks under the EFSF --
an idea that is helping prop up debt markets -- the motion risks
diluting what steps Germany is willing to consider on the crisis
at a summit scheduled for March 24/25.
 ""In principle, there won't be any agreement on any rescue
package without the explicit approval of Angela Merkel,"" said
Kornelius Purps, fixed income strategist at Unicredit in Munich.
 ""If she sticks to guidelines set by her coalition partners
last night there won't be an agreement on debt buybacks by the
EFSF (either) or on common euro bonds.""
 Germany has already said it will only agree new measures if
they come as part of a comprehensive package to solve the crisis
-- code for indebted states taking aggressive steps to among
other options cut back on public spending and cap wage growth.
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told
Reuters on Tuesday he was confident Germany would support a
strengthening of the euro zone fund despite Merkel's domestic
problems. [nLDE71L0JE]
 Portuguese and Spanish debt spreads against German Bunds
were little changed on Wednesday.

 ""ONLY TRYING TO HELP""
 The parliamentary motion, obtained by Reuters on Tuesday,
recommends the German government rule out bond buybacks and not
agree to any measures that could lead to a ""transfer union"". It
will be submitted to a vote in the lower house of parliament on
Friday. [ID:nBAT006023]
 It sends the government a message that Merkel could ignore,
but sources say she supports much of its content and will in any
case need parliamentary backing for new euro zone aid measures.
 ""We want to strengthen the chancellor's position,"" said a
parliamentary source.
 FDP parliamentary group leader Birgit Homburger added: ""The
resolution is designed to give the government backing for the
European negotiations because we know that the other EU
countries have other viewpoints than we do.""
 Merkel has urged deputies to keep in mind that Germany
cannot successfully push through all of its demands in talks
with its 26 EU partners.
 Bond buybacks are seen by markets and many euro zone
countries as a key ingredient to any deal's success in getting
on top of the region's year-long crisis.
 But any perceived relaxation of debt terms for euro zone
stragglers is a sensitive subject in a year of seven German
state elections. In the first vote in Hamburg on Sunday,
Merkel's CDU suffered their worst result since World War Two at
the hands of the Social Democrats. [ID:nLDE71K1CL]
 Some analysts were bewildered by the move.
 ""I don't think they've thought through the implications,""
said Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. ""What do
they want? It's not clear to me.""
 Mayer said that if Merkel feels bound by the resolution, the
end result would most likely be to further burden the European
Central Bank with the task of funding countries that cannot
access the market.
 Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist at the European Policy Centre
think tank, said the resolution could leave Merkel's hands tied.
 ""I'd expect Merkel will want to keep a certain amount of
flexibility in European negotiations, so I'm not sure how much
influence this paper will have. Certainly it isn't helpful.""

 * EU sets aside worries that Canada will scrap trade deal
 * Documents show EU believes it would win any WTO challenge
 By Pete Harrison and Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
BRUSSELS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Europe's trade and climate
chiefs are preparing to take a stand against imports of oil from
Canada's polluting tar sands, despite fears the move might wreck
a multi-billion dollar trade deal, according to EU sources and
documents.
 European Union sources said this week that Canada had
threatened to pull out of trade talks because of the clash, but
Ottawa has denied that.
 Canada says draft EU standards to promote greener fuels will
harm a possible future market for its oil sands -- tar-like oil
that is trapped in sediment and forms the world's second-largest
proven oil reserves after Saudi Arabia's.
 Last year the European Union appeared to back down on the
issue, putting commerce ahead of a strategy to curb greenhouse
gases from transport fuels by 6 percent this decade.
 But EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht and climate
commissioner Connie Hedegaard have spent months checking the
robustness of methodology to measure the carbon footprint of
fuels and are close to taking a stand on those that are the most
carbon-intensive, according to internal EU documents and
sources.
 ""We're constructively working on a solution between the two
teams, and there is a political assessment that this should be
done as soon as possible,"" said one EU source.
 The thinking behind that assessment is revealed in a series
of documents that were written last year but only released last
week after freedom-of-information laws were invoked.
 One EU official said that backing down on tar sands would
""undermine the credibility"" of Hedegaard's team and politically
would be ""a highly dangerous route for the commissioner to
proceed down"".
 
 THE SCIENCE
 Environmentalists oppose the tar sands industry, saying the
extra energy needed to extract oil from the north Alberta sands
intensifies climate damage, while polluted waste water harms
wildlife and rivers.
 Canadian officials have questioned the robustness of the EU
methodology.
 One EU official reported in a briefing note that Hedegaard
stood her ground in a meeting with parliamentarians.
 ""The commissioner took the following line: 'It is not about
whether or not to include a specific value for tar sands. I have
taken the political decision that there needs to be a specific
value as quickly as possible',"" the official reported.
 ""The only open question now is how quickly ... The
methodology needs to be sound.""
 Canada has challenged the EU at the World Trade Organization
in various disputes such as over hormone-treated beef,
genetically modified foods and seal products.
 EU sources say they expect it to mount a challenge on tar
sands as well.
 Another document showed that De Gucht's team advised that
the EU could win a Canadian legal challenge as long as the
approach to tar sands is based on solid science, proves an
environmental imperative, applies equally to ""dirty fuels"" such
as those from oil shale in EU member Estonia and is reviewed as
new evidence emerges.
 The documents also show a division last year between De
Gucht's and Hedegaard's teams about whether strong evidence
could be collated before 2012, but EU sources say that has now
been resolved in favour of decisive action now.
 ""We have to be careful not to pursue a goodwill policy that
will punish tar sands based on public opinion rather than solid
science,"" said one EU source.
 The Commission had initially proposed that tar sands be
ascribed a greenhouse gas value of 107 grams per megajoule of
fuel, making it clear to buyers that it had far greater
environmental impact than average crude oil at 87.1 grams.
 The latest EU research, published this month, backs that up.
 ""The science has been clear for a long time, and the
Commission has now confirmed that with its own studies, so now
there are no more excuses for not acting,"" said Nusa Urbancic at
green transport campaign group T&E.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - European central banks are
creeping towards rises in interest rates as inflation runs above
targets, although fears that they could stifle fledgling
recoveries may yet give them pause.
 Market expectations for when the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank will move have come forward sharply since
the end of last year and a poll on Wednesday showed more
economists moving to back an ECB rise in the third quarter.
 Minutes from this month's meeting of the Bank of England's
board -- facing inflation of more than twice its two percent
target -- showed three of its nine policymakers now want a rise.
 Other board members signalled they were also getting closer
to supporting a move, conditioning it on the economy recovering
from a slump in growth at the end of last year. 
 ""The hawkish tone of February's UK MPC minutes further
increases the chances of a near-term rate hike -- although the
minutes also make clear that much will depend upon how the
economic data pan out over the next few weeks,"" said Vicky
Redwood at Capital Economics.
 Unrest in the Middle East has only added to banks' worries
that soaring oil and food prices will lead to a longer-term bump
in inflation, although economists say every $10 rise in the cost
of a barrel of oil can also knock a half-point off economic
growth -- weakening the demand side push on prices.
 U.S. crude oil futures climbed to 2-1/2-year highs on
Wednesday on fears that output disruptions in Libya may spread
to other Middle East oil producers.
 ""Recent upbeat business surveys and hawkish comments from
Governing Council members suggest that the balance of risks to
our forecast is tilted towards an earlier ECB rate hike,"" said
Nick Kounis at ABN AMRO.
 
 PAUSE FOR THOUGHT
 Median forecasts of economists rather than investors,
however, still show most hikes delayed until the end of the
year.
 Largely, that relates to worries that the biggest spending
cutbacks in a generation -- and a full-scale debt crisis in
Europe -- will knock economies back.
 The British economy contracted 0.5 percent in the final
three months of 2010 and while the BoE needs to defend its
inflation-fighting credibility it does not want to further
derail a fragile recovery from the worst recession in decades.
 The median of a Reuters poll on Wednesday showed the ECB
also not shifting from record lows until at least October,
effectively giving governments in the euro zone more time to
deal with its debt and banking problems. [ECB/INT]
 ""We think that the ECB will at least await the results of (a
planned new) bank stress test before pulling the trigger on a
rate hike,"" said Peter Vanden Houte at ING.
 ""That makes the start of the fourth quarter an appropriate
time, as it will allow the ECB to preannounce it in September
when the new growth and inflation outlook is communicated.""
 While the consensus seems to be edging slowly towards a
sooner rate hike, it is still a far cry from expectations
derived from money markets which have priced in a 25 basis point
increase by August, and a second similar move by November.
 
 EAST-WEST DIVIDE
 Despite better growth than the euro zone, concerns over jobs
and growth look set to keep the U.S. Federal Reserve on hold for
longer. 
 Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans -- a voting
member this year and a consistent ""dove"" on inflation -- told
the Financial Times' Wednesday edition that policy should remain
accommodative for some time yet. [ID:nLDE71M052]
 Evans did also say last week, however, that the recovery may
be strong enough by June to allow the central bank not to extend
its current $600 billion bond-buying program.
 Banks further east and in emerging economies are already
well ahead of the major western banks.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia has been one of the most
pre-emptive in the developed world, lifting rates by 175 basis
points since late 2009 as its huge resource sector rides a wave
of high prices, fuelled by demand from China and India.
 China on Friday also raised required reserves to a record
19.5 percent, adding to an increasingly aggressive effort by
Beijing to stamp out stubbornly high inflation. [ID:nTOE71H068]
 That was the fifth increase since October and will force the
country's lenders to lock up a bigger chunk of their deposits at
the central bank, removing cash from the fast-growing economy
that otherwise would be pushing prices higher.
 The move followed an acceleration in inflation to 4.9
percent in the year to January.
 India's inflation eased less than expected in January to
8.23 percent, holding well above the central bank's comfort zone
and reinforcing expectations it will raise interest rates at its
March policy review.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - World stocks slid
further from recent 30-month highs on Wednesday as violence in
Libya pushed oil prices higher while fanning concerns about
inflation and the global economic recovery.
 On Wall Street the Dow was slightly lower a day after

and choke off exports pressured European equities and pushed
safe-haven government bonds higher.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $1.46 to $96.88 a

 The euro and sterling, meanwhile, rose versus the dollar on
expectations that interest rates in the euro zone and Britain
will rise sooner than U.S. rates and likely keep the greenback
under pressure. For details see [ID:nLDE71M1BU]

 ""The turmoil is not only about inflation and oil, but it is

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The euro and sterling rose on
Wednesday after two straight days of losses and were likely to
remain firm over the near term, boosted by expectations euro
zone and UK interest rates will rise faster than those in the
United States.
 The euro's recovery against the dollar from $1.3428, the
Feb. 14 low, has extended further, but with resistance at
$1.3745, the Feb 9 high. A break of $1.3745 should bring into
focus $1.3862, the three-month peak hit on Feb. 2.
 ""The main driver here are interest rate expectations. Over
the last couple of days, there has been firmer rhetoric from
the the European Central Bank and a lot of that has underpinned
interest rates and supported the euro,"" said Mark McCormick,
currency strategist, at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Traders said prospects of higher inflation and interest
rates have partially offset concerns about about political
tensions in North Africa and the Middle East. Still, analysts
said the market was wary and the dollar could see renewed
safety bids if unrest in the region spreads and oil spikes
higher.
 ""You could see that oil prices are a little bit firm so
there are still worries about supply issues but the equities
market seems to have bounced back a little bit from yesterday.
You can say that investors are cautiously optimistic about
what's going to happen in the Middle East,"" said McCormick.
 In early New York trading, the euro was up 0.5 percent at
$1.3715. Market players said the euro was supported by earlier
buying by Asian central banks and by real money selling of
dollars following a drop in U.S. Treasury yields the previous
day.
 Traders said there are sell orders lined up from $1.3725
through to $1.3750.
 Interest rate futures have priced in a 25 basis-point
increase in August in the wake of interest rate-supportive
comments from ECB officials Yves Mersch and Nout Wellink. They
said on Tuesday they were ready to fight inflation by raising
rates when needed.
 The euro VIX index, a measure of the currency's volatility
traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, spiked to 11.92
percent on Wednesday from 11.27 percent on Tuesday, suggesting
the expectation of more movements in the euro/dollar pair as
ECB rate expectations and Middle East turmoil come into play.
 Meanwhile, a Bank of England rate increase in the coming
months looked imminent after minutes to the February policy
meeting showed a third policymaker voted for a rise while
others would consider one if UK economic recovery resumed.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is due to speak later on
Wednesday and market players will be looking to see whether he
adds to the hawkish tone of Mersch and Wellink.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent against the pound at 84.51
pence as investors priced in chances that the BoE will start
raising rates faster than the ECB.
 Sterling was up 0.6 percent at $1.6224, though it was off a
high of $1.6275 just after the BoE minutes, with traders wary
of pushing the currency too much higher due to concerns about a
fragile UK economy.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.3
percent at 77.552, near an earlier three-week low of 77.411 and
well below a high of 78.326 hit on Tuesday.
 The higher oil prices kept a lid on the yen with the
Japanese economy vulnerable due to high oil imports. Dollar/yen
was flat at 82.72 yen, with talk of decent-sized option
expiries at 82.90 and 83.00 yen for later on Wednesday.

 * Passes previous peak seen in April 2008
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Feb 23 (Reuters) - International trade volumes
exceeded pre-crisis levels for the first time in December, and
global trade expanded by a record 15.1 percent in the whole of
2010, the Dutch CPB economic institute said on Wednesday.
 The data were further evidence of a buoyant global economy,
with the full-year expansion in trade more than compensating for
the 13.0 percent contraction in 2009 in the wake of the
financial crisis, it said in its monthly world trade monitor.
 The 2010 and 2009 figures were respectively the biggest
expansion and contraction since the institute started compiling
the data in 1991, CPB economist Jos Ebregt told Reuters.
 But the gains were shared unevenly, with trade expanding the
most in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America. Import
and export growth in the United States were close to the world
average but growth in the euro area lagged behind considerably.
 CPB, whose data are used by the World Bank and European
Commission, said its index of merchandise trade volumes -- set
at 100 in the year 2000 -- had reached 164.5 in December, up
from 161.5 in November and compared with a previous high of
163.8 in April 2008. The index fell to 130.3 in May 2009.
 World exports had recovered to pre-crisis levels in
November, but global imports did not match previous peaks until
December, the data show.
 The sum of global imports and exports should be the same,
but statistical differences in different countries often lead to
a disparity.
 The 2010 expansion in trade was boosted by strong growth in
the fourth quarter, when trade volumes rose 2.6 percent over
their level in the third quarter. In the third quarter they rose
only 0.7 percent over their level in the previous three months.
 The figures suggest that world trade -- and hence the global
economy -- is picking up again. The pace of recovery in world
trade had slowed for much of 2010 with the completion of the
initial wave of inventory-building.
 Looking at the more volatile monthly data, trade volumes
increased by 1.8 percent in December, the same as in November,
with export growth in emerging economies outpacing that of
advanced countries despite a 9.2 percent rise in Japan.
 Imports into emerging economies continued to expand in
December while falling in Japan and the euro area, it said.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2011 09:08AM ET</span>","An Icesave ""no"" vote could mean downgrade-Moody's"," STOCKHOLM, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Iceland's sovereign credit
rating could be downgraded if its voters reject a new plan to
repay debts to Britain and the Netherlands left over from the
financial crisis, Moody's said on Wednesday.
 Iceland's president on Sunday forced a referendum on the
issue when he vetoed a new law on repaying around $5 billion
Britain and the Netherlands doled out to savers who lost money
in Icesave accounts when Icelandic bank Landsbanki collapsed.
 ""If the agreement is rejected, we would likely
downgrade Iceland's ratings to Ba1 or below, given the negative
repercussions that would follow for the country's economic and
financial normalisation,"" the credit rating agency said in a
statement.
 Should Icelanders back the plan, which replaced an earlier
deal that voters rejected in a referendum in March 2010, Moody's
said it would probably raise the outlook on the government's
current Baa3 rating to stable from negative. 
 An opinion poll of 771 people by research group MMR earlier
this week showed 57.7 percent in support of the new repayment
bill.
 Resolving the Icesave dispute has long been seen as
necessary for Iceland's plan to join the European Union and for
getting the bruised economy back on its feet. 
 Iceland's financial sector collapsed in late 2008 along with
the crown currency and the economy. 
 Iceland was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund
and others and the economy has started to recover.
 Interest rates have tumbled to 4.25 percent from around 18
percent, inflation has been tamed and the economy should grow
this year for the first time since 2008.
 Failing to resolve the Icesave issue could hold up further
progress, particularly the removal of capital controls, a key
measure to restoring financial normality.
 The new deal, which parliament passed last week, is widely
seen as much more favourable to Iceland than that which voters
rejected last year.
 Moody's said that if the current bill is rejected, the issue
could have to be settled in court. 
 This could take a long time and cost Iceland more than the
50 billion Iceland crowns ($426 million) the government believes
to be the maximum tab the Icelandic taxpayer will have to pick
up under the current deal.

 * Libyan output could be down 300,000-400,000 bpd
 * Oil ports in Libya disrupted, say sources
 
 VIENNA/PARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - As much as a quarter of
Libyan oil output has been shut down, Reuters calculations
showed on Wednesday, as unrest prompted oil companies to warn of
production cuts in Africa's third-largest producer.
 Austria's OMV said on Wednesday it might be heading for a
full production shutdown in Libya. Total, Repsol, Eni and BASF
have also said they are either slowing or stopping output.
 The latest comments point to a growing impact on oil output
from Libya, which produces 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of
high-quality oil, or almost 2 percent of world output. About 1.3
million bpd is exported, mainly to Europe.
 ""We are evaluating the situation. We cannot say at the
moment how production is developing exactly,"" OMV Chief
Executive Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer told a news conference.
 ""It is going down sharply. We do not rule out that it could
come to a complete stop for a period of time.""
 The figures given by oil companies and industry sources so
far indicate that 300,000-400,000 bpd of Libyan output -- up to
a quarter of the total -- has been stopped, according to Reuters
calculations.
 Information can be conflicting on the country's output
because oil companies often speak of their share of production
and do not give overall supply at fields they operate or
participate in.
 ""We have started to suspend our production. It is still too
early to estimate the impact on our production,"" a Total
spokeswoman said on Wednesday. Total gets 55,000 bpd from Libya.
 
 OMV SHARES HIT
 OMV shares tumbled 5 percent on the news in Libya, which
provided the company with 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day of output in 2010, around a tenth of its total output.
 Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni said on Tuesday they had shut
down Libyan production. A day earlier, BASF unit Wintershall
confirmed it was winding down output of as much as 100,000 bpd.
 Repsol said it had shut the El-Sharara oilfield, which an
industry source said pumps about 200,000 bpd -- a figure equal
to 13 percent of the country's output.
 Libyan export terminals that ship both crude and oil
products remain disrupted, industry sources said.
 Libyan oil officials could not be reached by phone to
provide information on output and exports.

 * Refrains from taking fresh steps to curb rand strength

(adds interview with finance minister)
 By Stella Mapenzauswa
 CAPE TOWN, Feb 23 (Reuters) - South Africa on Wednesday
projected a much larger-than-expected budget deficit for next
fiscal year as the approach of elections put the government
under pressure to spend more.
 Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan insisted in a speech to
parliament that he was committed to a sustainable fiscal policy,
and blamed the big budget gap partly on weak revenues as the
economy emerged only gradually from recession. He also cited
special expenditures on flood relief.
 But private economists said that with municipal elections in
the second quarter of this year, the budget plan underlined the
heavy pressure faced by the ruling African National Congress to
spend more on job creation and social welfare. The official
unemployment rate is 25 percent.
 ""The budget is a good document which will aid additional
jobs growth, (but) it shows that the budget can be steered by
political necessity,"" said Peter Attard Montalto, emerging
markets economist at Nomura.
 Gordhan estimated a budget deficit in the year to March 2012
of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product, the same ratio which
is officially projected for the current fiscal year.
 That was a surprise because last October, the Treasury
predicted a budget gap of just 4.6 percent for the 2011/2012
year. Before Wednesday's speech, economists had expected Gordhan
to announce a deficit projection of about 4.5 percent.
 ""We're quite determined that we don't want to kill growth in
this country like some others might want to do elsewhere in the
world. We don't want to impose austerity measures on our
population,"" Gordhan said in an interview with Reuters.
 The yield on 15-year government bonds rose about 10 basis
points on Wednesday. Although the government said it would not
issue more bonds domestically to fund the deficit -- instead, it
will borrow overseas -- its net borrowing is projected to rise
from 141 billion rand ($19.9 billion) in 2010/11 to 162 billion
rand in 2012/13, before declining to 149 billion in 2013/14.
 Gordhan pledged the deficit would resume falling in coming
years as the economy recovered, hitting 3.8 percent of GDP by
2013/14. But this figure would still be above the 3.2 percent
deficit forecast for that year by the government last October.
 ""I think that it will come as a shock to people that the
deficit is wider. Clearly to me it suggests the reality of the
situation where government expenditure is under enormous
pressure because of all the different areas they are trying to
cater for,"" said Kevin Lings, chief economist at Stanlib.
""It's clear to me that if we are not able to grow at a faster
pace, employ people and expand the tax-base, then that objective
is going to be quite difficult to achieve.""
 
 GROWTH
 The Treasury on Wednesday shaved its economic growth
forecast for calendar 2011 to 3.4 percent from 3.5 percent
projected last October. The economy grew 2.8 percent last year,
emerging from its first recession in nearly two decades.
 Gordhan said strong commodity prices, low interest rates and
faster global growth were the main forces behind recovery in
Africa's biggest economy. He projected growth at 4.1 percent in
2012 and 4.4 percent in 2013.
 But those rates are still well below levels needed to reduce
unemployment -- last year the Treasury estimated annual growth
of 7 percent was necessary to make a big dent in joblessness.
 The ANC is pouring billions of dollars into job promotion
schemes. Besides 39 billion rand already earmarked for job
creation and factory investment, Gordhan said the government
would spend an extra 5 billion rand on a youth employment
subsidy to get school-leavers and graduates into work.
 ""We cannot view the fact that 42 percent of young people
between the ages of 18 and 29 are unemployed as merely a
statistic,"" he told parliament.
 Annual inflation, at 3.7 percent in January, is likely to
move towards the upper end of a 3-6 percent target range by 2013
as growth accelerates, the Treasury predicted.
 Gordhan included one important sop to the financial markets
in his budget; he refrained from announcing any fresh measures
to curb strength of the rand, beyond saying his ministry would
continue to back dollar-buying by the central bank.
 This omission pushed the rand up to a three-week high
against the dollar and by suggesting that money would continue
to flow into South Africa seeking currency appreciation, it
limited the negative impact of the budget on the bond market.

players said the euro was supported by earlier buying by Asian
central banks and by real money selling of dollars following a
drop in U.S. Treasury yields the previous day.
 However, some traders said the single currency could succumb
to profit taking, with Asian central banks also reported leaving
offers at $1.3740-50. The euro was down 0.1 percent against the
pound  at 84.55 pence as investors priced in chances
that the BoE will start raising rates sooner than the ECB.
 Sterling was up 0.7 percent at $1.6243 , though it
was off a high of $1.6275 just after the BoE minutes, with
traders wary of pushing the currency too much higher due to
concerns about a fragile UK economy. 
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar <.DXY> was down
0.4 percent at 77.456, near an earlier three-week low of 77.411
and well below a high of 78.326 hit on Tuesday.
 
 MIDDLE EAST, LIBYA TENSIONS
 The euro faced resistance around the Feb. 9 peak at $1.3745.
A clear break of $1.3750 could open the way for more gains, with
the next major resistance seen at $1.3862, a three-month peak
hit in early February.
 Tuesday's ECB comments caused the euro to bounce sharply
from Tuesday's low of $1.3525, when unrest in Libya caused oil
prices to spike, prompting investors to cut risk exposure and
lifting safe-haven flows into the dollar and Swiss franc.
 The euro and perceived higher-risk currencies remained
vulnerable, however, to any worsening of tensions in North
Africa and the Middle East. Oil prices have firmed on concerns
the unrest may spread to other oil-producing nations. [O/R]
 Global stocks were also lower, although U.S. stock futures
 pointed to a firm start on Wall Street.
""There are still a lot of uncertainties in North Africa, but
the impact tends to wane if there is no new news,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen, but he
added that markets would keep a close eye on oil prices.
 A defiant Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's leader, said on Tuesday
he would not be forced out by the deadly unrest sweeping
Africa's third-largest oil producer. [ID:nLDE71L2LE]
 Rising oil prices kept a lid on the yen  with the
Japanese economy vulnerable due to high oil imports. Dollar/yen
was up 0.1 percent at 82.81 yen, with talk of decent-sized
option expiries at 82.90 and 83.00 yen for later on Wednesday.
 The New Zealand dollar was flat at $0.7469, having hit a
two-month low of $0.7433  after Tuesday's deadly
earthquake raised concerns about the economy. Those concerns
were seen reducing the likelihood of rate rises this year and
could even prompt the central bank to cut rates. [ID:nL3E7DM1YX]

 * Anti-govt leader: group will respect election, if fair

 By Jason Szep and Jean Yoon	
 BANGKOK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Thailand's prime minister said
on Wednesday he expected his party to have the edge in a
mid-year general election but he would probably need to form a
coalition to govern, signalling a close and potentially volatile
poll.	
 ""We are looking at some time around the first half of this
year,"" Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told Reuters in an
interview. ""It is a close election like last time, except that
we are slightly ahead. The latest polls show we are ahead in all
polls except the northeast.""	
 Thailand's next election is its most important in a decade,
given a long-running political crisis that erupted into violent,
anti-government ""red shirt"" protests in April and May in which
91 people were killed and more than 1,800 wounded.	
 But the 46-year-old, Oxford University-educated Abhisit said
he expected the election to bring stability regardless of who
wins, and he doubted the poll would derail the Thai economy,
Southeast Asia's second-biggest, which he believes could expand
3-5 percent this year.	
 He denied assertions by the red shirt protest movement that
troops opened fire on unarmed civilians in the April and May
unrest, and said he wanted a state investigation into the
violence to be concluded ""as quickly as possible"".	
 ""At no point did we send in soldiers or police to use
firearms against peaceful protesters,"" he said.	
 
 A preliminary state investigation into the violence
concluded that special forces positioned on an elevated railway
track fired into the grounds of a Buddhist temple where several
thousand protesters had taken refuge on May 19, according to a
copy of the report viewed by Reuters in December.	
 Three of six people shot dead at the temple were probably
killed by troops, the investigation found, contradicting
statements by the military, which denied soldiers were
responsible for the killings. That report has been passed to
police for further investigation.	
 ""The only incident where there is still mystery is the
temple incident,"" Abhisit said. ""I can't see the motive for the
military or the soldiers to shoot into the temple.""	
 ""Buildings were set on fire and soldiers and police had to
protect the fire engines,"" he added. ""Whether those orders were
executed without errors is something we need to investigate.""	
 
 COALITION MOST LIKELY	
 Most members of the red shirt group, who include many rural
and urban poor, support ousted former populist premier Thaksin
Shinawatra.	
 Thailand's three previous elections were dominated by
parties allied with twice-elected Thaksin, a former
telecommunications tycoon who was ousted in a 2006 military coup
and lives in exile to avoid a jail sentence for corruption.	
 Many political analysts had expected the latest pro-Thaksin
party, the opposition Puea Thai, which has broad support among
the red shirts, to win the next election.	
 But that's no sure bet. The opposition is in disarray, beset
by infighting, and smaller parties could get a boost from
changes to electoral laws.	
 ""The challenge for us is to get good candidates in seats
where we haven't had MPs for some time in the north and
northeast. But I am confident we can retain most of our seats,
that we will make gains in the central region and make solid
gains in the north,"" said Abhisit, whose term expires in
December.	
 ""A coalition government is the likeliest scenario,"" he said.	
 He said protests by the red shirts and another group, the
ultra-nationalist yellow shirts who have withdrawn support for
his government and are now seeking to topple him, have been
peaceful and were unlikely to disrupt plans for elections.	
 The leader of the red shirt movement told Reuters on
Wednesday it would respect the result of the election, provided
the polls were fair.	
 Group leader Thida Tojirakarn also said she saw no
reason for protracted protests, now that movement leaders
detained after last year's violence had been released on bail
this week.	
 The wild card for Thailand's economy, Abhisit said, remained
inflation, especially from high oil and commodity prices, which
he would like to see tackled by the Group of 20 major economies.	
 ""It is an issue that we hope the G20 will discuss so that
there is more coordination,"" he said.	
 He said Thailand's 83-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the
world's longest-ruling monarch, appeared in good health when he
visited him on Tuesday in the hospital where he has remained
since being admitted on Sept. 19, 2009.	
 The king's withdrawal from public view has raised concern in
largely Buddhist Thailand, where many of his subjects regard him
as almost divine.	
 ""It is fine,"" Abhisit said of the king's health. ""I had an
audience with him last night for about an hour and a bit. He was
engaged in conversations and very well aware of all the issues.""

(Adds details, economist comment)
 By Philip Blenkinsop
 BRUSSELS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial new orders
defied forecasts and rose in December, confirming a strong
economic recovery going into 2011, but pointing to weaknesses of
consumer demand and debt-heavy peripheral nations.
 The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said on
Wednesday industrial new orders in the 16 countries using the
euro in December increased 2.1 percent month-on-month from
November, for an 18.5 percent year-on-year gain.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.8 percent
monthly decrease and a 16.2 percent annual rise.
 New orders fell sharpest in Ireland, declined for a second
straight month in fellow financial bailout recipient Greece, and
also dropped in Portugal and Spain -- the countries financial
markets believe could be next in line for a rescue.
 Except for Germany, which suffered declining industry demand
for big ticket items, new orders were up in every other euro
zone country.
 Without the volatile orders for ships, planes and trains,
industrial orders rose 1.3 percent on the month and were 18.9
percent higher than a year earlier.
 
 CONSUMER RECOVERY IN QUESTION
 Martin van Vliet, euro zone economist at ING, said the
growth figures were impressive, but it was important to remember
they represented a recovery from a virtual freefall in 2009.
 While demand for capital and intermediate goods was strong,
orders for durable consumer goods fell 2.3 percent from November
-- the second consecutive monthly decline -- pointing to some
weakness in household demand.
 ""This raises some questions about the strength of consumer
spending in the euro zone. At this stage I'm not willing to give
consumers the benefit of the doubt. We have to be very cautious
about celebrating the consumer recovery,"" Van Vliet told
Reuters.
 Industrial new orders translate into industrial production,
which is the key component of gross domestic product (GDP)
growth.
 Industrial output in December slipped as a cold snap crimped
activity, although economists said the outlook was promising,
with signs of recovery in much of the region's weaker periphery.

 Citigroup economist Giada Giani said the strong order
figures signalled a decent increase of economic growth in the
first quarter of 2011.
 ""We've had a bit of a disappointment in GDP growth for Q4
last year, but the most forward-looking indicators -- including
the industrial orders -- do suggest that growth is about to pick
up again in the first quarter of 2011,"" she said.
 Euro zone GDP rose 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter against
the previous three months, the same rate as in the third
quarter, with contractions in Greece and Portugal and some
impact from a December cold snap.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2011 06:32AM ET</span>",Merkel faces hurdle after MPs oppose ESM debt buyback,"* Coalition deputies pass non-binding resolution
 * Members of parliament oppose government debt buybacks
 * Analysts say could tie Merkel's hands in EZ negotiations
 
 By Erik Kirschbaum and Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Feb 23 (Reuters) - German ruling coalition MPs are
pressing Chancellor Angela Merkel to rule out purchases of debt
by the euro zone's permanent bailout fund, showing how little
political room for manoevre she may have in crunch talks on the
crisis next month.
 Merkel has been dragging her heels on agreeing to boost the
scope and size of the bailout fund, and fears of further
election defeats has to pressure for her not to underwrite the
debts of the euro zone's struggling periphery.
 Markets for Spanish, Portuguese and other euro zone debt
have been propped up by expectations that Germany would agree
next month to a comprehensive plan to end the crisis.
 Although non-binding, the resolution by MPs in her Christian
Democrats (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU) and Free
Democrats (FDP) recommended ruling out buybacks of government
debt by the the European Stabilisation Mechanism (ESM) when it
replaces the existing bailout fund in 2013.
 The motion, demanding the German government not agree to any
measures that could lead to a ""transfer union"", was laid out in
a document obtained by Reuters. It will be submitted to a vote
in the lower house of parliament this week. [ID:nBAT006023]
 ""Parliament expects that jointly financed or guaranteed
purchase programmes of government debt would be ruled out for
reasons of constitutional and European law, and on economic
grounds,"" the document said, referring to the ESM.
 The euro zone's 17 leaders will meet in Brussels on March 11
and bond buybacks are seen by markets and many euro zone
countries as a key ingredient to any deal's success in getting
on top of the year-long crisis. 
 But any perceived relaxation of debt terms for euro zone
stragglers is a sensitive subject in a year of seven German
state elections.
 In the first vote in Hamburg on Sunday, Merkel's CDU
suffered their worst result since World War Two at the hands of
the Social Democrats. [ID:nLDE71K1CL]
 It is, however, making the temporary EFSF bailout fund able
to buy bonds that is the most crucial part of what investors
hope for from next month's talks. The motion did not explicitly
exclude such purchases.
 
 MERKEL SUPPORTS CONTENT
 The three parliamentary groups used the resolution to send
the government a message. Merkel could ignore it, but sources
say she supports much of its content. She will in any case need
parliamentary backing for new euro zone aid measures.
 Parliamentary sources said they discussed the resolution
with Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in advance.
They also said FDP chairman Guido Westerwelle, whose party is
especially sceptical about euro zone bailout measures, expressly
praised the resolution as a victory for the FDP position.
 Analysts said they were bewildered by the move.
 ""I don't think they've thought through the implications,""
said Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. ""What do
they want? It's not clear to me.""
 It is, however, making the temporary EFSF bailout fund able
to buy bonds that is the most crucial part of what investors
hope for from next month's talks. The motion did not explicitly
exclude such purchases.
 Mayer said if bond buying by the ESM fund was ruled out,
there were three possible scenarios for dealing with those
countries not able to tap financial markets.
 ""It's then either the taxpayer engineering a full bailout or
the central bank buying all the bonds that cannot be sold in the
market and taking the private sector out,"" he said. ""The third
possibility they are not addressing is one that allows an
unmanaged default. But I don't think anyone wants that.""
 He said that if Merkel feels bound by the resolution, ""we
will most likely end up in a situation where we will further
burden the European Central Bank with the task of funding
countries that cannot access the market.""
 Germany has already said it will only agree new measures if
they come as part of a comprehensive package to solve the crisis
-- code for indebted states taking aggressive steps to among
other options cut back on public spending and cap wage growth.
 Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist at the European Policy Centre
think tank, said the resolution could leave Merkel's hands tied.
 ""At the moment we need to keep all options open because
there are continuing problems in certain countries where it is
very hard to see how they will ever be able to deal with the
mountain of debt they have got without some form of new
mechanism,"" he said.
 ""I'd expect Merkel will want to keep a certain amount of
flexibility in European negotiations, so I'm not sure how much
influence this paper will have. Certainly it isn't helpful.""

 By Paritosh Bansal and Jonathan Spicer
 NEW YORK/TORONTO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group Inc
could launch a rival bid for NYSE Euronext to avoid being left
on the sidelines, a source said, as traditional exchanges race
to merge to see off upstart electronic rivals.
 This is one option Nasdaq, valued at $5.7 billion, is
considering as a spate of deals shakes up an industry under
intense cost pressure from new entrants such as BATS Global
Markets, which last week snapped up rival Chi-X.
 Nasdaq's alternatives include tying up with
IntercontinentalExchange Inc or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME) to wrest NYSE from its planned $10.2 billion takeover by
Deutsche Boerse, the source familiar with the matter said.
 Meanwhile, Toronto market operator TMX Group Inc pressed the
case for its agreed deal with London Stock Exchange, warning
lawmakers opposing the tie up that Canada risked damaging its
free-trade credentials if it blocked it.
 TMX Chief Executive Thomas Kloet told Reuters he was taking
political opposition to a deal ""very seriously"".
 Even so, he said Canada was putting its reputation on free
trade and competition on the line as it considers a proposal to
create a transatlantic operator worth $7 billion in market value
and the world's fifth-largest exchange ranked by trading volume.
 ""One of the things Canada has to make sure to consider as it
goes through this is what if it says no,"" Kloet said.
 Kloet's counterpart at the LSE, Xavier Rolet, told Reuters
he saw some good support in Canada for the deal but expected
""some tense moments"" as the former British exchange monopoly
positions itself for the next wave of mergers.
 ""In five years there'll be three, four international
exchange groups with global distribution capabilities,"" Rolet
told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
 ""The start of the second generation of consolidation in the
exchange world is just that ... We're just getting started,
guys.""
 Outside Canada, most attention has focused on merger talks
between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext rather than LSE and
TMX. The propose deal is drawing comparisons with CME, the
world's biggest derivatives marketplace.
 Shares in Deutsche Boerse fell 2.7 percent on Wednesday
afternoon, with traders saying that the group's stock was coming
under pressure from the NYSE deal. The German group's shares
have sunk since the deal was announced.
 
 NASDAQ VULNERABLE
 Nasdaq focuses on intensely competitive, low-margin equities
trading, so may feel vulnerable to more price-competitive
exchanges that could result from the wave of merger plans.
 The Wall Street Journal said Nasdaq might also consider
selling itself or buying another competitor if it is unable to
compete with Deutsche Boerse on the NYSE deal. A Nasdaq
spokesman was not available to comment.
 NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse dominate futures and
options on European bonds, shares and rates, with Deutsche
Boerse's Eurex unit focused on the long end of the interest rate
curve and NYSE Euronext's Liffe unit on the short end.
 The Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext merger would give the
combination annual trading volume exceeding $20 trillion. But to
succeed it needs approval from a host of regulators.
 The latest wave of consolidation was kicked off by a $7.9
billion bid by Singapore Exchange for the Australia stock
exchange operator ASX Ltd late last year. A previous flurry
ended with the financial crisis.

 NO BIG ASIAN M&A
 Asia runs the risk of being left behind in the sudden wave
of transatlantic stock exchange consolidation, given its tough
regulatory regimes, cumbersome ownership structures and
protectionist minded governments.
 Thailand's market regulator said that most of South East
Asia's stock exchanges are several years away from getting
involved in global bourse consolidation.
 Exchanges in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam,
Indonesia and Thailand are setting up electronic trading links
between their markets with the eventual aim of having
cross-border dealing in all their listed shares.
 The exchanges of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and
Vietnam, have a combined capitalisation of about $2.4 trillion
and were the darlings of emerging market investors last year.
 ""Right now the only linkage is through the electronic means
of this project, and that is the only likely option for now,""
Tirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, Secretary General of Thailand's
Securities and Exchange Commission, told Reuters.

 * Sentance calls for 50 bps rise, Dale and Weale 25 bps
 * Other MPC members say case for rate rise growing

 By David Milliken and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The Bank of England moved closer
this month to raising interest rates, after a third policymaker
voted for a rise and others said they might tighten policy if
the economy rebounds from a slump at the end of last year.
 Minutes to the BoE's Feb. 9-10 meeting showed chief
economist Spencer Dale joined Andrew Sentance and Martin Weale
in voting for higher rates, tilting the 9-member Monetary Policy
Committee towards a May rate rise to tackle rising inflation.
 Economists had expected a repeat of last month's 7-2 vote to
keep policy unchanged, though they did not fully exclude the
chance that another MPC member would join the BoE's hawkish camp
after Governor Mervyn King said last week that the MPC was
unusually divided.
 ""Given the strength of inflation, firm activity data seem
likely to propel the MPC into a rate hike sooner rather than
later,"" said Simon Hayes, economist at Barclays Capital.
 Inflation is running at double the BoE's 2 percent target
and is set to rise further, putting the Bank under pressure to
take action. However, many policymakers believe price rises are
being driven by one-off factors like last month's rise in VAT
and the spike in oil prices.
 Nonetheless, strong purchasing managers' surveys this year
suggest Britain's economy is back on track for recovery after a
snow-related blip at the end of last year. This could allow
firms to pass on rising input costs and drive up inflation.
 ""Of those members not favouring a rise in Bank Rate, some
thought that the case for an increase had nevertheless grown in
strength,"" the minutes said.
 New details of the BoE's inflation forecasts published on
Wednesday showed the central bank expects inflation to remain
above target until the end of 2012 and to fall below 2 percent
thereafter if interest rates rise as markets expect.
 Money markets are pricing in a quarter-point increase in
borrowing costs from their record low 0.5 percent by May, with
rates seen rising to 1.25 percent by the end of this year.
 ""I think it is pretty likely that within the next three to
four months we will see 25 basis points on UK rates,"" said Peter
Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank.
 
 THIRD MAN
 The BoE faces the dilemma of how to defend its
inflation-fighting credibility without derailing a fragile
economic recovery, as the 0.5 percent drop in economic output at
the end of 2010 was only partly due to the cold weather.
 But divisions on the committee are becoming more apparent,
with Dale the first BoE insider on the MPC to side with the
external members in taking a dissenting view. 
 Dale and Weale both called for a 25 basis point increase in
the interest rate, while Sentance upped his call to a 50 basis
point increase due to concerns that firms were passing on higher
costs.
 Analysts reckon Deputy Governors Charles Bean and Paul
Tucker may be the next to join Dale in his call, increasing the
isolation of Governor King, who has already come under pressure
for not doing enough to curb inflation.
 ""Taking the Inflation Report and the minutes together gives
a rather overt message that -- even though views on the
committee are diverse -- a majority which probably does not
include the Governor are moving toward higher rates in May,""
said Malcolm Barr, economist at J.P. Morgan.
 
 BALANCE OF RISKS
 The minutes showed that the MPC saw upward risks to
inflation from commodity prices, loose monetary policy in
emerging markets and inflation expectations -- though there was
little evidence that the last of these had increased materially.
 And Adam Posen repeated his call for a 50 billion pound ($81
billion) expansion to the BoE's programme of quantitative easing
asset purchases to 250 billion pounds.
 He acknowledged that a sustained increase in global demand
or a shift in sentiment against sterling could outweigh domestic
downward pressures on inflation, but he did not see this risk as
large enough to require tighter policy now.
 Turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa has pushed up
oil prices to over $100 a barrel, adding to inflation pressures
but also potentially acting as a drag on UK growth.
 Meanwhile, hefty government spending cuts in the coming
financial year are also expected to sap consumer spending and
the health of businesses reliant on public sector contracts.
 ""There was merit in waiting to see indicators of how the
economy performed at the start of the year to help assess
whether or not the decline in GDP in the fourth quarter presaged
sustained economic weakness,"" the minutes said.
 ""A rise at this juncture could damage household and consumer
confidence, which remained fragile.""

 * BoE minutes show more hawkish 6-3 split for no rate change
 * Sterling upside hampered by long positioning
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Sterling rose against the dollar
and the euro on Wednesday after Bank of England minutes for
February showed a hawkish tone, with three members of the
Monetary Policy Committee voting for a rise in interest rates.
 Bank of England Chief Economist Spencer Dale joined Andrew
Sentance and Martin Weale in voting for higher rates in
February, minutes of the BoE's Feb. 9-10 meeting showed.
 Moreover, the minutes also suggested that some of those
opposed to a rate hike this month would consider it if the
economy shows signs of picking up after an unexpected fall in
output at the end of 2010.
 ""It doesn't necessarily mean that the committee is that much
closer to putting interest rates up, but certainly the
sentiment expressed in the main headlines from the minutes is
more hawkish than expected,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist
at Investec.
 Sterling rose around half a U.S. cent to trade at $1.6275,
its highest since Feb 3. It faltered ahead of this year's peak
at $1.6279 and slipped back to stand at $1.6213, up around 0.5
percent on the day. Traders highlighted a sizeable option expiry
at $1.6170 which could influence the day's price action.
 The euro fell around 30 pips to a session low of 84.22
pence, moving back under its 200-day moving average at 84.47. It
was last trading at 84.46, down 0.2 percent on the day.
 Analysts said the recent build-up of long positioning in the
pound amid rising interest rate expectations meant further gains
would be more difficult to come by.
 The market continues to expect a 25 basis point increase in
June of this year, with an outside chance it could come as early
as May.
 ""The upside looks more difficult for sterling because rate
hike expectations won't have been brought forward too much
further by the minutes,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank.
 ""Sterling will now be more vulnerable to negative economic
news as it has risen a long way already.""
 The second estimate of fourth quarter growth due on Friday
will be of particular importance after the first estimate showed
that Britain's economy unexpectedly shrank in the last three
months of 2010.
 The government blamed the drop in output on the harshest
December weather on record.
 But some economists say recent revisions to industrial
production and construction output cancel each other out and
most expect no change to the GDP figure this time.

expansion to the BoE's programme of quantitative easing asset
purchases to 250 billion pounds.
 But he acknowledged that a sustained increase in global
demand or a shift in sentiment against sterling could outweigh
domestic downward pressures on inflation, but he did no t see
this risk as large enough to require tighter policy now.
 The minutes follow a BoE quarterly Inflation Report which
suggested rates may have to rise two or three times this year
for the central bank to have an optimal chance of getti ng
inflation back on track in the medium term.
 The minutes showed that the MPC saw upward risks to
inflation from commodity prices, loose monetary in emerging
markets and inflation expectations -- though there was little
evidence that the last of these had increased materially.

 LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The euro extended gains against
the dollar on Wednesday, buoyed by expectations for higher euro
zone interest rates after European Central Bank officials
stressed their readiness to fight inflation.
 Market players said the euro was supported by earlier buying
by Asian central banks and by real money selling of dollars
following a drop in U.S. Treasury yields the previous day.
 ECB officials Yves Mersch and Nout Wellink said on Tuesday
the ECB was ready to fight inflation by raising rates when
needed, prompting interest rate futures to price in a 25 basis
point hike in August.
""People are happy to put on long euro/dollar positions on
the back of the ECB comments and there is a bit of risk appetite
returning after the risk aversion we had yesterday,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""There are still a lot of uncertainties in North Africa, but
the impact tends to wane if there is no new news.""
 The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.3710. However, some
traders said the single currency could succumb to profit-taking,
with offers from Asian central banks reported at $1.3740-50.
 The euro and perceived higher risk currencies were also
vulnerable to any worsening of tensions in North Africa and the
Middle East that may cause a spike in oil prices.
 The euro faces a cluster of resistance around $1.3750, with
the Feb 9 peak at $1.3745 -- above which would be a three-week
high -- and trendline resistance drawn from peaks hit in
November 2010 and February that comes in near $1.3765.

 RATE HIKE TALK
 A clear break of the $1.3750 resistance area could open the
way for further gains in the euro, with the next major
resistance on charts seen at $1.3862, a three-month peak hit in
early February on trading platform EBS.
 ""The market seems to be short (the euro) after yesterday's
moves and we could see a rise toward such levels (near $1.3750)
on short-covering,"" said a trader for a Japanese brokerage house
in Tokyo.
 The prospect of a rate hike in the UK also boosted sterling,
which rose 0.5 percent to $1.6209 versus the dollar as investors
awaited the Bank of England's February meeting minutes to see if
more policymakers voted for a hike.
 The ECB comments caused the euro to bounce sharply from
Tuesday's low of $1.3525, when unrest in Libya caused oil prices
to spike, prompting investors to cut risk exposure and lifting
safe-haven flows into the dollar and Swiss franc.
 Uncertainties remained, however, helping the Swiss franc to
a three-week high of 0.9355 francs per dollar. 
 Popular protests have toppled entrenched leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia, but a defiant Muammar Gaddafi said he would not be
forced out by the deadly unrest sweeping Africa's third-largest
oil producer. 
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.35
percent at 77.490, near an earlier three-week low of 77.411 and
well below a high of 78.326 hit on Tuesday.
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent versus the yen to 82.67 yen
on talk of selling by Japanese investment trusts and
expectations for Japanese exporters to step up dollar selling
towards month-end, though bids were reported near 82.50 yen.
 The Australian dollar recovered to trade up 0.4 percent at
$1.0034 but the New Zealand dollar hit a two-month low of
$0.7433 after Tuesday's deadly earthquake raised concerns about
the economic outlook.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - World stocks fell further from a
recent 30-month high on Wednesday while the euro rose as unrest
in Libya drove oil higher and fanned concerns about inflation
that could hamper a global economic recovery.
 Wall Street suffered its worst day since August on Tuesday
as the turmoil in oil exporter Libya gave investors an excuse to
sell stocks and consolidate positions after a rally that has
driven world stocks 6 percent higher this year.
 The spike in oil prices comes at a time when many
fast-growing emerging economies already face rising price
pressure and the need to raise interest rates. 
 European Central Bank officials also stressed they stand
ready to fight inflation with tighter monetary policy on
Tuesday, prompting interest rate futures to bring forward
expectations for a quarter point interest rate hike to August.
 ""There is very little reason for people to be adding to risk
at the moment. The Middle East is going to cast a pall over the
markets until they can see any proper direction,"" said Justin
Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management.
The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was down 0.25
percent at 340.74, falling more than 2 percent from Monday's

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 0.4 percent. Oil
companies with operations in the Middle East fell, including BP

respectively.
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> lost half a percent.

 By Sudip Kar-Gupta
 LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Barclays shares rose after a U.S.
federal judge ruled the British bank's 2008 transaction to buy
much of the U.S. operations of failed Wall Street firm Lehman
Brothers was a fair deal.
 Barclays shares were up by about 1.5 percent at 0815 GMT on
Wednesday, making the stock the top gainer on Britain's
benchmark FTSE 100 index, which was down by around 0.5 percent.
 Barclays also outperformed a 0.4 percent gain in the broader
European bank sector.
 ""This is a good decision for Barclays,"" Seymour Pierce
analyst Bruce Packard wrote in a research note. Seymour Pierce
maintained a ""hold"" rating on Barclays shares.
 Packard said that a ruling against Barclays could have
resulted in Barclays making payments to the Lehman side, thereby
affecting the British bank's core Tier 1 capital ratio.
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck ruled that Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc's hurried sale of much of its U.S. operations to
Barclays at the height of the credit crisis was fair, and that
Lehman's bankruptcy estate is not entitled to recover an $11
billion ""windfall"".
 The ruling followed a trial in which Lehman had argued that
Barclays had unfairly got a ""sweetheart deal"" in acquiring its
U.S. investment banking and brokerage operations.
 Lehman had agreed to sell that business for about $1.85
billion on Sept. 20, 2008, just five days after the company's
Chapter 11 filing became what many consider the seminal event of
the global financial crisis.
 Peck's ruling is a setback for Lehman, which last month
projected it would have $60.1 billion to pay out to creditors,
who believe they are owed six times that amount.
 Lehman has also sued other banks including Bank of America
Corp, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and JPMorgan Chase & Co
to recover assets for creditors. (Editing by Jon

(Adds comments by CEO and analyst)
 By Adrian Krajewski
 WARSAW, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Poland's biggest telecoms group
TPSA reported a worse than expected plunge in profits and warned
of a further decline in revenue this year.
 The France Telecom affiliate has in recent years suffered
from declining revenues due to a market slowdown and the local
regulator's drive to boost competition.
 TPSA said it sees further cuts in regulatory mobile
termination rates (MTRs), the fees operators charge for calls to
pass through their networks, pushing this year's sales 2-4.5
percent lower after a 5.1-percent fall in 2010, but levelling
off in 2012.
 ""Looking at the possible cuts in MTRs this year, we expect
our 2012 revenue to be at around par with 2011,"" Chief Executive
Maciej Witucki told a teleconference.
 The market was unimpressed, as shares in the operator,
valued at $7.6 billion with 49.79 percent owned by France
Telecom, underperformed the market with a 0.6 percent fall to
16.65 zlotys.
 ""The group's 2011 outlook is below my expectations. I saw
this year's revenue falling by 2 percent,"" said DM IDM SA
analyst Jakub Viscardi, adding that the group's core profit
outlook was also lower than his predictions.
 ""Everything points to the fact that we'll have to wait until
2012 for revenue erosion to halt,"" he said.
 The continued fall in sales added to strains for TPSA's net
profit, which fell 92 percent last year to 107 million zlotys
($37 million) short of the 155 million forecast by analysts.
 The decisive hit came from the 1.1 billion zlotys TPSA
booked in new provisions for claims from Danish company GN Store
Nord's unit DPTG in a decade-long dispute over traffic volumes
on a fibre-optic network which DPTG built in Poland.
 GN has struggled to secure payments from TPSA, as the Polish
company continues to reject DPTG's claims filed in Vienna. The
two claims are jointly worth 5.3 billion Danish crowns ($974
million), with 2.9 billion already outstanding.
 However, despite the looming claims and last year's
provisions, TPSA maintained its dividend at 1.5 zlotys a share,
a total of 2 billion zlotys.
 The group expects its 2011 core profit (EBITDA) margin to
reach 36-37 percent and aims to have free cash flow of at least
2.4 billion zlotys this year, compared with 2.45 billion last
year.

 * Frequent price changes hamper user firms' output plans -JFE
 * JFE to keep existing strategy after Nippon Steel merger
(Adds comment, detail)
 TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japan's JFE Steel Corp has rejected
a proposal of monthly pricing for coking coal from Australia's
BHP Billiton as such a move would make its costs difficult to
predict, the firm's president said on Wednesday.
 ""We strongly oppose such a change and we will never accept
it,"" Eiji Hayashida, president of JFE, the world's No.5
steelmaker, told a news conference.
 ""Such a shift will make steelmakers' earnings unpredictable,
and steel-using companies will not be able to draw up stable
production plans if prices change frequently.""
 Hayashida said JFE and BHP are yet to start formal talks, and
declined to give details of BHP's proposals.
 Marius Kloppers, BHP's chief executive, has in the past two
years made pricing for coal and iron ore sales quarterly instead
of annual, prompting steep falls in profits at steelmakers as
they struggle to pass higher input costs on to customers.
The Japan Metal Bulletin, an industry daily, said on Tuesday
that BHP, the world's biggest diversified miner, wanted monthly
pricing to replace quarterly pricing for half the volume of its
coal supply to each Japanese steelmaker.
 Earlier this week, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Japan's
third-biggest steelmaker, said it had received a proposal from
BHP Billiton on a new pricing scheme for supplying coking coal
after April.
 JFE's Hayashida also said the planned merger of its archrival
Nippon Steel Corp, the world's No.4 steel maker, and Sumitomo
Metal Industries Ltd in October 2012 will not affect its business
strategy.
 He said the company has no plans to complain to regulators
even if Nippon and Sumitomo Metal's combined domestic market
share for certain products tops 60-70 percent should global
competition exist.

 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher
on Wednesday after European Central Bank officials stressed
their readiness to raise interest rates to fight inflation,
though it was expected to face resistance near $1.3750.	
 Market players said the euro was supported by buying from
hedge funds and Asian central banks and by short-covering, while
a drop in U.S. Treasury yields the previous day helped weigh on
the dollar.	
 ""The market seems to be short (the euro) after yesterday's
moves and we could see a rise toward such levels (near $1.3750)
on short-covering,"" said a trader for a Japanese brokerage house
in Tokyo.	
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3692 , having bounced
back sharply from the previous day's intraday low of $1.3525.	
 Luxembourg's Yves Mersch and Nout Wellink of the Netherlands
said on Tuesday the ECB was ready to fight inflation by
increasing interest rates when needed, prompting interest rate
futures to bring forward expectations for a 25 basis point rate
hike to the ECB's Aug. 4 meeting.

 ""The associated warning about the risks of distortions from
excessively low interest rates might not have been a clarion
call for higher rates, but again highlight the clear divergence
with the approach of the Fed,"" said David Watt, strategist at
RBC Dominion Securities.	
 ""These comments overshadowed concerns about the EU
periphery."" 
 The euro faces a cluster of resistance points roughly around
$1.3750, namely its Feb. 9 peak of $1.3745 and trendline
resistance drawn off peaks hit in November 2010 and February
that comes in near $1.3765.	
 The euro has lacked the energy to test such resistance
levels after Germany's main ruling party suffered a crushing
defeat at a regional election on Sunday, making it harder for
Chancellor Angela Merkel to pass federal legislation. 
 
 KIWI OFF TWO-MONTH LOWS 
 A clear break of that resistance area, however, could open
the way for further gains in the euro, with the next major
resistance on charts seen at $1.3862, a three-month peak hit in
early February on trading platform EBS.	
 ""There was that big defeat suffered by Merkel, and there is
an election coming up in Ireland, so the euro still has some
weaknesses,"" said a trader for a major Japanese bank in Tokyo.	
 ""Even if the euro breaks above $1.3800, I don't get the
sense that it will clear the previous peak near $1.3860. Its
moves are likely remain range-bound,"" the trader said.	
 The dollar dipped against the yen, falling 0.2 percent to
82.64 yen . 
 Weighing on the dollar was talk of dollar-selling by
Japanese investment trusts and market expectations for Japanese
exporters to step up their dollar-selling toward the end of the
month, while talk of bids near 82.50 yen were seen lending the
dollar support. 
 The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.0019 ,
regaining some ground after sliding on heightened risk aversion
the previous day, when revolt in Libya triggered a surge in oil
prices, sparking worries about slower global growth.	
 The New Zealand dollar rose 0.1 percent to $0.7472 ,
having touched a two-month low of $0.7433 earlier on Wednesday.	
 The kiwi earlier extended its losses after sliding more than
2 percent on Tuesday, its biggest one-day slide in more than
seven months.	
 A 6.3 magnitude quake hit New Zealand's second-biggest city
of Christchurch on Tuesday, killing at least 75 people. It was
the country's most deadly natural disaster for 80 years.

 Markets have almost completely priced out any risk of a rate
hike over the next 12 months, and have begun bracing for the
possibility that New Zealand's central bank may lower interest
rates.

 WELLINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand's devastating
earthquake on Tuesday has ended any chance of an interest rate
hike this year and threatens to scupper the government's plan to
bring its finances back into the black in three years.	
 The magnitude 6.3 quake close to the second-largest city,
Christchurch, killed at least 75 people and destroyed many
buildings in the business district. The death toll is expected
to rise. 
 The earthquake has caused far more damage and impact than a
7.1 one that shook Christchurch in September. Prime Minister
John Key said that so far no one is able to estimate the costs
of the damage. The September quake caused an estimated NZ$5
billion ($3.7 billion) in damage.	
 Moody's investors service said on Wednesday it saw no
immediate impact from the latest earthquake on New Zealand's Aaa
rating.	
 Analysts said Tuesday's calamity has effectively ended any
chance that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will increase
rates this year, although even before the earthquake
expectations for an increase had been diminishing following a
slew of weak economic data.	
 ""A continuation of exceptionally loose monetary conditions
through 2011 now appears wholly appropriate,"" said RBC Capital
Markets strategist Michael Turner.	
 Due to the quake, Turner cut his growth forecast for this
year to 1.1 percent from 1.9 percent while keeping his 2012
projection at 2.8 percent. 
 Standard Chartered said it was cutting its 2011 GDP forecast
to 1.4 percent from 2.0 percent, and its 2012 forecast to 2.7
percent from 3.0 percent.	
 The quake delivered another major blow to an economy already
struggling to gather momentum. Financial markets have even
priced in a 44 percent chance of a rate cut as the
economy is teetering on the brink of a prolonged recession.	
 The RBNZ will issue its next monetary policy statement on
March 10. Prior to the earthquake, analysts were already
confident there would be no rate change. 
 Now, there might be a rate cut, to aid efforts to recover
from the quake. 
 ""There's a risk the bank could actually cut rates in March
to restore confidence and try to provide more accomodative
setting for the economy,"" said Khoon Goh, head of market
economics and strategy at ANZ National Bank.	
 But economists also cautioned about the possible use of
monetary policy to stimulate a quake-hit economy.	
 ""If the RBNZ do cut next month, it's the right decision
based on the slump in activity, but it sends the entirely wrong
message that natural disasters dictate monetary policy,"" said
Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific research at TD Securities.	
 The central bank has kept rates at 3.0 percent since
September and said rates will remain low until the recovery
gains momentum, which analysts had -- prior to Tuesday --
expected to be July at the earliest.	
 
 WOBBLY ECONOMY	
 New Zealand's economy has shown anaemic growth since
emerging from its longest recession in 30 years in 2009.	
 The economy unexpectedly shrank in the quarter ended Sept.
30, and some later data has been dismal, raising the risk of a
prolonged recession.	
 ""There are risks that the New Zealand economy will have
contracted in three straight quarters by end of March 2011,""
RBC's Turner said.	
 Rising prices for the country's main agricultural exports --
dairy, beef and wool -- have failed to spur spending as
many consumers have kept their wallets closed and paid off debt.

 The labour market has also been in the doldrums, with
unemployment rising to 6.8 percent in the December quarter from
6.4 percent in the September quarter. 
 The Canterbury region, where Christchurch is located,
accounts for about 15 percent of both GDP and population.	
 J.P. Morgan estimates that insured losses from
Tuesday's earthquake could be $12 billion, a source who has seen
its note said on Wednesday. 
 Prior to the earthquake, the government said it will cut
spending and borrowing to help bring the country's budget back
into surplus by 2014/15. For the year that ended last June 30,
there was a deficit of NZ$6.3 billion.	
 Analysts said the quake threatens the plan as the recovery
and reconstruction of Christchurch will add significant costs to
the already strained government budget.	
 ""Given that they are operating under quite tight fiscal
parameters, it could well be that part of the budget will get
squeezed further in order to free up money to assist the
reconstruction,"" ANZ's Khoon said.	
 The plan on having a surplus in 2014/15 could be delayed, he
said.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Hiroyasu Hoshi	
 TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japan's $1.4 trillion state
pension fund called on the government to rein in the nation's
burgeoning debt, saying it could reach a critical point as early
as 2016 if it was not tackled.	
 Japan's struggle to control its bulging public debt -- the
largest among developed countries at double the size of its $5
trillion economy -- prompted Moody's this week to warn it could
cut the country's credit rating.	
 ""We want the government to cope with the debt problem,""
Takahiro Mitani, chairman of the Government Pension Investment
Fund (GPIF), the world's biggest pension fund, told Reuters in
an interview.	
 ""If (the government) leaves the (debt) situation as it is,
then at some point in five to 10 years, it will reach a crucial
point,"" Mitani said.	
 The GPIF, whose assets are larger than both the Canadian and
Indian economies, is a major force in the Japanese government
bond (JGB) market, where it places two-thirds of its investment.	
 Moody's Investors Service cut the outlook on Japan's Aa2
sovereign rating to negative from stable on Tuesday, warning
that government policies may be insufficient to rein in the
country's public debt.	
 In January, Standard & Poor's downgraded Japan's credit
rating for the first time since 2002, saying Tokyo lacked a
coherent strategy for dealing with the debt pile.	
 It said an ageing population, persistent deflation and the
government's loss of power in parliament compounded its fiscal
challenge.	
 
 
 POLITICAL MEASURES	
 Mitani did not elaborate on what might happen if the
government failed to resolve the debt issue.	
 But he said he was not sure if Prime Minister Naoto Kan's
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will be able to come up with
draft plans on tax and social welfare reforms by June as he has
promised.	
 However, Mitani hoped some kind of political measures to
resolve the country's debt problem would take place over the
next two to three years.	
 As the head of a public pension fund, Mitani has to be
careful about what he says about government policy, bond market
participants said. In addition, alarmist comments could back
fire on the fund's own investments, they said.	
 ""Big holders of JGBs such as the GPIF, others
pension funds and banks cannot give the slightest hint that they
could sell JGBs if the debt problem is not fixed as that would
kill themselves too,"" said a strategist at a Japanese asset
management company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.	
 ""The consequences for Japan for not resolving the debt
problem would be quite similar to what we are seeing in Greece
-- hike taxes, cut pension payments and cut social
expenditures.""	
 JGB prices climbed on Wednesday as tensions in the Middle
East prompted safe-haven buying from investors. The 10-year
yield fell to a three-week low. 
 
 GRADUAL MOVE INTO EMERGING MARKETS	
 Kan, who took office only last June, has staked his career
on fiscal reforms.	
 But the opposition has refused to join talks on the issue
and instead is piling pressure on the unpopular leader to call a
snap election by threatening to block budget related bills.	
 Japan's debt started to swell in the 1990s as the country
tried to revive its fortunes after a property bubble burst.
However, fear of default is muted because Japan can draw on
massive public savings, unlike the United States which relies
heavily on foreigners to finance its debt.	
 Mitani said investors were not making decisions based on the
actions of credit rating companies. ""Rather, they are watching
overall fund flows into JGBs to make their decisions,"" he said.	
 Indeed, he said GPIF was not planning to change its basic
portfolio as a result of the actions by the credit rating
companies.	
 But the fund aims to diversify its portfolio by investing in
emerging markets, where it hopes to start channelling funds in
the financial year that starts in April, the chairman said.	
 The fund's investments in emerging markets would be gradual
and the initial amount would be small, he said. The fund had
flagged this move last year. 
 The fund has completed its first round of screening to pick
fund managers for the emerging market investments, Mitani said.
The selection selection process could take about a year.	
 ""We want to take more time and we want to be more selective
in choosing managers.""	
 The GPIF, which invests the reserves of national and
corporate pension plans, held total assets of 117.6 trillion yen
as of September.	
 It suffered a loss of 1.5 percent on its investments in the
six-month period to September, compared with a 7.91 percent gain
for the whole financial year that ended last March.	
 The fund's performance up until September lagged other major
overseas counterparts, such as California Public Employees'
Retirement System (Calpers), which posted a return of 3 percent,
while the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board produced a bigger
return of 5.2 percent.	
 Besides Japanese government bonds, the fund also has
investments in domestic shares, foreign bonds and foreign
equities. As of September, more than 9 percent of the GPIF's
total assets were in foreign equities.

fund, the world's largest, said on Wednesday the fund's
investment strategy will not be affected by downgrades of
Japanese government bonds by credit ratings agencies.
 Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) holds
assets of about $1.4 trillion, larger than both the Canadian and
Indian economies, and is a major force in the JGB market, where
it parks two-thirds of its assets.
 ""We are not thinking of changing our basic portfolio as a
result of ratings changes by credit rating companies,"" GPIF
Chairman Takahiro Mitani told Reuters in an interview.
 Moody's Investors Service changed the outlook on Japan's Aa2
sovereign rating to negative from stable on Tuesday, warning that
government policies may be insufficient to rein in the country's
huge public debt.
 That warning followed Standard & Poor's downgrade of its
rating on JGBs last month, its first such cut in nine years.
 Mitani said JGB prices rose and the market showed a muted
reaction to Moody's latest action, on views that heavy fund flows
from domestic banks and other investors into JGBs would not be
affected by the downgrade.
 ""I don't think investors are making investment decisions
based on credit rating companies' actions. Rather, they are
watching overall fund flows into JGBs to make their decisions,""
he said.
 Still, it is important for the Japanese government to resolve
its fiscal problems, Mitani said, adding that he shared the
credit rating firms' views that the country cannot leave the debt
situation as it is.
 Japan's debt problem will reach a crucial point in five to 10
years if the government fails to resolve it, he said.

disruption

 By Nick Macfie	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 23 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures climbed
to 2-1/2-year highs on Wednesday on fears that output
disruptions in Libya may spread to other Middle East oil
producers and hurt global economic growth, helping push Asian
stocks lower.	
 Popular protests have toppled entrenched leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia, but a defiant Muammar Gaddafi, the world's
second-longest-serving leader after the Sultan of Brunei, said
he would not be forced out by the deadly unrest sweeping
Africa's third-largest oil producer. 
 At last three oil companies have halted output in Libya,
which pumps 1.6 million barrels per day, or nearly 2 percent of
global supply. 
 U.S. crude rose as high as $96.08 a barrel, its
strongest level since October 2008. By 0600 GMT, the contract
had trimmed gains to trade at $95.50, up 8 cents on the day.

 Brent crude rose 77 cents to $106.55 a barrel.
On Monday, Brent hit a 2-1/2-year high of $108.70. 
 Higher energy prices could impede economic growth and
hurt corporate profits even as they fuel inflationary pressures,
complicating policymaking for governments and central
banks. 
 ""Even if Libya completely shuts down, there isn't a supply
issue. But (U.S. crude) could go to $100, given the potential
for this contagion to spread to Saudi Arabia,"" said Jonathan
Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking Services in
Sydney.	
 Asia stocks fell as investors sold off riskier assets.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.8 percent, while
the MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
slid 0.5 percent.	
 Transport companies, whose fuel bills are headed up,
extended sharp losses from Tuesday, with Korean Air Line
shedding 1.8 percent. Chinese carrier Air China
was down 1 percent while Hong Kong's dominant carrier
Cathay Pacific fell 2.2 percent.	
 ""The only observation an outsider sitting in Asia can make
about events in the Middle East and North Africa is that the
unpredictability of events and the difficulty in ascertaining
the 'end game' mean that equity markets settling back into
equilibrium is still some way off,"" said Nomura analyst Sean
Darby.	
 ""The ongoing risk is if food prices were to continue to rise
due to unseasonal weather and indeed if fuel prices were to
climb further. Non-linear responses such as bans on exports of
food by producers or curtailment of shipments of fuel due to
non-payment would only exacerbate the situation on the ground
and make it more difficult to return to normalcy.""	
 Gold , a traditional safe haven in times of trouble,
was little changed around $1,398 an ounce, after a six-session
rally, but the trend is still expected to be upwards.	
 Currencies viewed as safe havens, such as the yen and Swiss
franc, have also been boosted by events in Libya.	
 The euro edged higher after European Central Bank officials
stressed their readiness to fight inflation by raising interest
rates, though it was expected to face resistance near $1.3750.

 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3690 , having bounced
back sharply from Tuesday's intraday low of $1.3525.	
 Wall Street stocks on Tuesday suffered their worst day since
August in what could be the start of a long-anticipated pullback
after gaining more than 20 percent in the past six months.	
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.44
percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 2.05
percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.74
percent.	
 U.S. stock futures rose 0.3 percent in Asian trade on
Wednesday, suggesting Wall Street will recover some ground later
in the day.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japan's annual export growth slowed
to its weakest pace in more than a year in January and the trade
balance swung to a deficit for the first time in almost two years
as shipments to China lost steam, but economists say the central
bank's forecast for an export-led recovery remains intact.
 Economists said the slowdown was likely to be temporary as
underlying demand overseas was still strong and companies were
likely to increase inventories.
 Still, the data could be uncomfortable for the government and
the Bank of Japan as turmoil in Libya and a recent spike in
commodity prices cloud the outlook for export-reliant Japan.
 Improvements in exports and industrial output prompted the
government and the Bank of Japan to raise their economic
assessments this month. But sluggish domestic demand and
persistent deflation mean that the BOJ will stick to its
ultra-easy monetary policy for the time being.
 ""China has started to tighten policy to slow its economy and
this shows in January. China stopped tax breaks on cars in
December, which also had an impact,"" said Takahide Kiuchi, chief
economist at Nomura Securities.
 ""The slowdown in Japan's export growth in January is
temporary and exports could continue as final demand overseas is
still strong and the inventory cycle suggests there is more
demand.""
 SHIPMENTS TO CHINA
 The 1.4 percent annual rise in exports in January was the
lowest growth since November 2009 and much slower than the median
forecast for a 7.4 percent annual increase. That followed a 12.9
percent rise in the year to December.
 Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's
total exports, rose 0.4 percent from a year earlier, a sharp
slowdown from a 14.8 percent annual increase in December and the
smallest increase since October 2009.
 Shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner,
increased 1.0 percent from a year earlier, a small fraction of
the 20.1 percent annual increase in the previous month and also
the smallest increase since October 2009.
 The slowdown was mainly due to the Lunar New Year holidays, a
finance ministry official said.
 Japanese exporters limited shipments to China and other parts
of Asia ahead of the holidays, which this year fell at the
beginning February, compared with mid-February last year.
 The ministry expects exports to those regions to return
quickly to normal levels given their robust economic growth.
 The trade balance came to a deficit of 471.4 billion yen
($5.67 billion), its first deficit in 22 months. That compared
with the median forecast for a 60.0 billion yen surplus.
 Japan's economy shrank slightly in the final quarter of last
year, hurt by an expiry of government incentives for car
purchases and a slowdown in exports, but is widely expected to
resume growing in the current quarter as exports and industrial
production pick up.
 The central bank and the government both upgraded their
assessment of the economy this month due to signs that export
growth is boosting factory output.
 Moody's Investors Service warned on Tuesday, however, that it
may cut Japan's sovereign rating if government policies fall
short of comprehensive tax reform needed to bring ballooning
public debt under control.
 That added to the woes confronting unpopular Prime Minister
Naoto Kan, who is struggling to push bills needed to enact a $1
trillion budget for the year from April 1 through a split
parliament while he grapples with a growing rift in the ruling
party.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled on
Tuesday as the revolt in Libya drove crude oil prices to
30-month highs and sparked fears of slower global growth if the
unrest spreads to other oil-exporting countries in the region.
 Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's all-country world
index <.MIWD00000PUS>, fell 1.6 percent.
 Wall Street stocks suffered their worst day since last
August in what could be the start of a long-anticipated
pullback after gaining more than 20 percent in the past six
months. Heavy volume and rising volatility gave credence to a
significant correction to the uptrend which has seen stocks
double from their March 2009 lows in the past two years.
 Crude oil prices surged in London and new York to the
highest levels in 2-1/2 years with North Sea Brent 
touching$108.57 a barrel before trimming most of those gains
after Saudi Arabia said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would meet any supply shortages caused by the Libyan
revolt. For details seen [ID:nN22284303]
 ""The major underlying fear in the market is that these
protests spread in the region to even larger producers like
Saudi Arabia,"" said Andy Lebow, a trader at MF Global in New
York. ""While that might not look likely right now, even a hint
of real problems there could send prices vertical.""
 LIBYA OIL SUPPLY THREAT
 Libya declared force majeure on all oil product exports as
political violence shut more than 13 percent of the country's
1.6 million barrels per day of crude production.
 A defiant Muammar Gaddafi vowed to die ""a martyr"" in Libya
and said he would crush a revolt which has seen eastern regions
already break free from four decades of his rule.
[ID:nL3E7DM0K1]
 Libya only ranks third in Africa after Nigeria and Angola
in oil production, but investors are concerned that the spread
of violence in North Africa and the Middle East could disrupt
the supply of regional oil exports.
 U.S. crude for March delivery , which expired at the
close, settled up $7.37 at $93.57 a barrel. The day's trading
included business done electronically on Monday, when floor
trade was shut due to the U.S. Presidents Day holiday.
 In London, Brent crude oil futures settled up 4 cents at
$105.78 a barrel, its highest close since September 2008.
 WALL STREET FEAR GAUGE JUMPS
 The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX>, Wall Street's so-called
fear gauge, surged more than 27 percent in its highest one-day
jump since last May. Volume on the three main stock exchanges
was the highest this month and the second-highest this year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 178.46
points, or 1.44 percent, at 12,212.79. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 27.57 points, or 2.05 percent, at
1,315.44. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 77.53
points, or 2.74 percent, at 2,756.42.
 Higher oil prices hit certain stocks on concerns of higher
fuel costs. The Arca airline index <.XAL> fell 5.5 percent.
 Stocks resisted further decline for much of the day after
data showing U.S. consumer confidence rose to a three-year high
in February. But a drop in home prices for the sixth month in a
row in December suggested the economy still faces some hurdles.
[ID:nN22277393]
 The Swiss franc, traditionally sought in times of
heightened geopolitical tension, firmly gained against the euro
as concerns about oil supplies cooled risk appetites and sent
investors into safe-haven assets such government debt. The
Swiss currency rallied about 1.0 percent versus both the euro
and U.S. dollar.
 The euro  was down 0.15 percent at $1.3654, and
against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.43
percent at 82.75.
 ""Libya is the obvious theme today, so you have a little bit
of safe-haven trading,"" said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of
currency sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose, boosted by Libya-sparked
safe-haven buying, and some analysts anticipate further price
gains on expectations that economic growth will wane.

 NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc and yen rose
on Tuesday as a revolt in Libya stoked safe-haven demand, and
fears of escalating unrest in the Middle East and Africa could
spark further gains in these currencies.
 Stocks tumbled worldwide as oil   soared and
investors shunned riskier assets after Muammar Gaddafi vowed to
die in Libya as a martyr and said he would crush a revolt that
has seen eastern regions already break free from his rule. For

 NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled on

and rekindled fears of slower global growth if the unrest
spreads to other major oil suppliers in the region.
 Crude prices surged in New York and London, where prices

 Libya declared force majeure on all oil product exports as
political violence shut more than 13 percent of the country's

 The Swiss franc, traditionally sought in times of
heightened geopolitical tension, firmly gained against the euro
as concerns about oil supplies cooled risk appetites and sent
investors into safe-haven assets such government debt.

 (Adds quotes, details)
 By Patrick Werr
 CAIRO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Egypt is planning a stimulus
package after its economy was badly hurt by political turmoil,
Finance Minister Samir Radwan said on Tuesday. 
 He estimated that the political unrest that led to the
ousting of President Hosni Mubarak would reduce growth to 4.3
percent in the financial year to end-June from the government's
previous forecast of 6 percent.
 Egypt's economy has been hurt by a collapse in tourism and
foreign investment since protests erupted on Jan. 25. Banks,
businesses and factories have only reopened in the last few
days, and the stock exchange remains closed indefinitely. 
 ""The goal of the stimulus package is to get the economy on
its feet again,"" Radwan told reporters after meeting U.S.
Undersecretary of State William J. Burns.
 Radwan said the Finance Ministry was still working on the
stimulus package and did not know how big it would be, but he
hoped it would be financed both on-budget by the government and
off-budget by the private sector.
 ""The whole issue of fiscal space is becoming a bit tighter
because of the emergency measures we have taken in the past
three weeks,"" he said. ""Therefore we have to draw on the private
sector.""
 Radwan said that Egypt wanted to draw on help from ""our
development partners.""
 Last week Radwan estimated that the government's budget
deficit would rise as high as 8.4 percent of gross domestic
product this financial year compared to a forecast made before
the crisis of 7.9 percent.
 He said he reassured Burns that Egypt would not retreat from
economic reform or change the basic economic philosophy it has
followed since it adopted a liberal reform programme in 2004.
 Burns told reporters that the United States was prepared to
help Egypt.
 ""We want to do everything we can to be supportive, and that
includes providing support for economic recovery as well as for
Egypt's economic modernisation,"" Burns said. ""There is a range
in which we can be helpful.""

 * Ban was initially proposed from Jan. 24 for one month
 * Ivorian tension sent cocoa to highest in about 30 years
 
 (Adds statement extending ban to March 15)
 ABIDJAN, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast presidential
claimant Alassane Ouattara will extend until March 15 the period
of the ban he has called on cocoa exports to try to unseat his
rival, a statement from his government said on Tuesday.
 The ban, initially proposed from Jan. 24 for one month, has
been largely heeded by exporters even though Ouattara remains
holed up in a hotel, while incumbent Laurent Gbagbo holds onto
power in the top cocoa producing country.
 ""The government informs traders that the measure of
suspending exports of coffee and cocoa is prolonged until March
15, 2011,"" the statement by Ouattara's Prime Minister Guillaume
Soro said. ""(It) reminds them that those who contravene this
measure risk national and international sanctions.""
 Earlier Ouattara government spokesman Patrick Achi had said
it would be extended until March 10.
 Ouattara beat Gbagbo in a Nov. 28 presidential election,
according to U.N.-certified results, but Gbagbo has refused to
go, defying international condemnation and Western sanctions.
 African leaders are currently in Ivory Coast seeking an end
to the standoff but hopes of a breakthrough are low and the
absence of West African leaders highlighted the difficulty of
forging a united African position on the crisis.
 Gbagbo retains the support of the military and controls most
state institutions, including cocoa regulators and the ports.
 But Ouattara has warned exporters that, assuming he comes to
power, they would be sanctioned if they cooperated with Gbagbo's
government by paying export taxes to ship their beans.
 Exporters face the added dilemma of European Union sanctions
on a number of Ivorian institutions backing Gbagbo and the
combined measures have contributed to the drying up of exports.
 The turmoil in Ivory Coast has driven cocoa futures to the
highest levels in more than three decades.

 CHRISTCHURCH, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Rescue teams worked under
floodlights in the early hours of Wednesday searching for scores
of people trapped after an earthquake struck New Zealand's
second biggest city, killing at least 65 people.
 It was the second strong quake in five months to hit
Christchurch, a city of almost 400,000 people. About 120
survivors had been pulled from the rubble but the death toll was
expected to rise.
 ""We may well be witnessing New Zealand's darkest day...The
death toll I have at the moment is 65 and that may rise,"" said
Prime Minister John Key, who had flown to his home city.
 Authorities said they had formally identified 32 dead but
more bodies were in collapsed buildings and crushed cars.
 ""We have a temporary mortuary here at Christchurch police
station and I have 38 bodies here at the moment and the streets
are still littered with bodies,"" police shift commander Russell
Gibson said on Radio New Zealand.

 FACTBOX-New Zealand's biggest quakes [ID:nL3E7DM0GP]

 Tuesday's 6.3 magnitude quake struck at lunchtime, when
streets and shops were thronged with people and offices were
still occupied. It was New Zealand's most deadly natural
disaster for 80 years.
 Rescuers, working through the night under floodlights,
focused on two buildings, a financial services block, whose four
stories fell on top of each other, and a television building
which also housed an English language school.
 About a dozen Japanese students at the school were believed
to be missing, an official in Japan told Reuters, and Japan's
public broadcaster NHK said several other students from another
group in the building were also unaccounted for.
 
 SIX SHELTERING TOGETHER
 Eight people were pulled from the building and six were
known to be sheltering together.
 A further 22 people were known to be trapped in the finance
building of whom at least three had made contact. Some of those
trapped were unhurt.
 ""We are getting texts and tapping sounds from the living and
that's our focus at the moment,"" Gibson said.
 Mayor Bob Parker described the city, an historic tourist
town, as a war zone.
 A local state of emergency was declared and the city centre
was cordoned off and patrolled by troops in armoured personnel
carriers.
 ""A significant number of people have been got out of
buildings alive. Of course we also find deceased people in the
rubble,"" Parker said, adding it was estimated a further 100
people were trapped.
 It was the country's worst natural disaster since an
earthquake in 1931 in the North Island city of Napier killed 256
people.
 On the way into the city, a Reuters correspondent saw
buckled roads, toppled buildings and pools of water. Police and
the army were patrolling the streets.
 Christchurch has been described as a little piece of
England.
 It has an iconic cathedral, now largely destroyed, and a
river called the Avon. It had many historic stone buildings and
is popular with English-language students and with tourists
visiting the scenic South Island.
 
 EMERGENCY SHELTERS
 Emergency shelters were erected in schools and at a race
course. Helicopters were used to try to douse a fire in one
office building, while a crane was used to help workers trapped
in another office block.
 ""I was in the square right outside the cathedral -- the
whole front has fallen down and there were people running from
there. There were people inside as well,"" said John Gurr, a
camera technician who was in the city centre when the quake hit.
 Aerial TV footage of surroundings suburbs showed
once-elegant homes in ruins and roads cut off by huge boulders.
 There have been offers of help from the United States and
Japan, while Australia is sending 148 search and rescue
specialists, including sniffer dogs.
 ""They will be deployed straight into the city to assist the
New Zealand teams,"" said Civil Defence head John Hamilton.
 Britain's Queen Elizabeth offered her sympathy and said in a
statement she was ""utterly shocked"" by news of the quake.
 Christchurch is built on silt, sand and gravel, with a water
table beneath. In a quake, the water rises, mixing with the sand
and turning the ground into a swamp, swallowing up roads and
cars.
 Unlike last year's even stronger tremor, which struck early
in the morning when streets were virtually empty, people were
walking or driving when the shallow tremor struck, sending
awnings and the entire facades of buildings crashing down.
 The tremor was centred about 10 km (six miles) southwest of
Christchurch, which had suffered widespread damage but no deaths
in a 7.1 magnitude quake last September.
 New Zealand lies between the Pacific and Indo-Australian
tectonic plates and has a average of more than 14,000 tremors a
year, of which about 20 are normally above magnitude 5.0.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc firmly gained
against the euro and U.S. dollar on Tuesday as political unrest
in Libya, the third largest oil producer in Africa, had
investors embracing its safe-haven appeal.
 The Swiss franc's one-month implied volatility surged to a
roughly two-week high of 11.20 percent . The Swiss
currency, traditionally sought in times of heightened
geopolitical tension, will likely remain firm against other
currencies if events in the Middle East continue to escalate.
 Risk aversion remained the dominant theme after the
defiance of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the face of
mounting public revolt stoked uncertainty, while there were
some supply cuts from one of the world's major oil exporters.
[ID:nLDE71L0ER]
 Brent  rose and U.S. crude oil  reached a

 ""Currency markets remain in a risk averse mode as violence
in Libya is showing few signs of abating and wider Middle East
tensions persist,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency
strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""Hawkish comments from ECB's Mersch are coming on the back
of similar remarks from other policymakers recently and are
likely to raise the stakes ahead of the ECB policy announcement
in early March,"" he said. ""The 'risk off' environment is also
driving most emerging currencies lower, a move that we would
still see as an eventual buying opportunity.""
 In early afternoon New York trading, the Swiss franc was
broadly firmer, with the euro  down 1.0 percent at
1.2823 francs, having earlier dropped as low as 1.2790 francs,
its weakest since late January. The franc also rose against the
U.S. dollar and was last up 0.8 percent 0.9393 francs ,
the highest since Feb. 2.
 The dollar, in general, tends to fall when oil prices,
which are denominated in dollars, rise because it becomes
cheaper for overseas investors holding foreign currencies to
buy crude oil.
 The euro, meanwhile, erased early gains garnered against
the U.S. dollar after hawkish comments from European Central
Bank officials increased euro zone rate hike expectations. The
currency hit a session high of $1.3704  on electronic
trading platform EBS and was last down 0.2 percent at $1.3650.
 ECB policymaker Yves Mersch was quoted as saying the
central bank may have to adjust its language on inflation while
fellow ECB policymaker Nout Wellink was also quoted expressing
concerns about inflation. For more see [ID:nWEB0672].
[ID:nWEB0708]
 These comments followed recent hawkish rhetoric from
various ECB officials, including policymakers Juergen Stark and
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, which have highlighted the prospect of the
ECB raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
 Higher oil prices are seen weighing on global growth,
particularly in emerging countries heavily dependent on oil and
commodity imports. Rising prices have already led to higher
inflation, which can threaten vulnerable economies.
 The New Zealand dollar  tumbled to US$0.7455, its
weakest since late December, and was last down 2 percent at
US$0.7483. The currency was hit by speculation that the
economic damage caused by an earthquake which rocked the
country's second biggest city may increase the chance of an
interest rate cut. [ID:nSYA008335]
 The U.S. dollar rose 1.0 percent against the Australian
dollar  to US$0.9984.
 The dollar was up around 0.2 percent at 77.811 against a
currency basket <.DXY>, but was well below the day's high of
78.326.
 The tensions in Libya also lifted demand for safe-haven
U.S. Treasury debt. [ID:nN22433590]
 Lower Treasury yields decrease the appeal of dollar assets,
especially against another low-yielding currency such as the
yen. The relationship between dollar/yen and U.S. yields has
come back into play in recent weeks, strategists said.
 The dollar fell to a session low at 82.76 yen ,
down 0.4 percent.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2011 01:20PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-EU experts approve trace GM in feed imports-official," * Committee backs 0.1 percent limit on unapproved GM in
imports
 * Decision must now be approved by EU governments, lawmakers
 * Environmentalists accuse EU of caving-in to GM industry
 (Adds EU diplomat quote in paragraph 3)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - An EU committee voted on
Tuesday to allow traces of unapproved genetically modified (GM)
material in animal feed imports, the European Commission said,
in a bid to secure grain supplies to the import-dependent bloc.
 EU governments and lawmakers now have three months to either
approve or reject the committee's decision, before the rules can
be adopted by the EU executive as law.
 ""In all likelihood the measure will be adopted by member
states and EU parliamentarians, even if we expect a lively
debate in the European Parliament,"" one EU diplomat involved in
the negotiations said.
 The Commission, industry and exporting countries argue the
0.1 percent threshold is needed to avoid a repeat of supply
disruptions in 2009, when U.S. soy shipments to Europe were
blocked after tiny quantities of unapproved GM material were
found in some cargoes.
 The limit ""addresses the current uncertainty EU operators
face when placing on the market feed based on imports of raw
materials from third countries"", the Commission said in a
statement.
 The EU imported more than 51 million tonnes of animal feed
last year, worth almost 15 billion euros ($20.5 billion),
according to Commission trade statistics. About half was GM soy
from Brazil and Argentina developed by U.S. biotech company
Monsanto.
 Green groups accused the EU executive of caving in to
GM-industry lobbying by reversing its ""zero-tolerance"" policy on
unauthorised crops. Some environmentalists argue that the effect
of consuming GM crops is unknown and say these have not
completed the EU's safety assessment process.
 They said the move was an unnecessary solution to a problem
that does not exist.
 ""Weakening safety rules to appease the animal feed industry
compromises human and environmental safety,"" said Friends of the
Earth food campaigner Mute Schimpf.
 But the head of EU feedmakers' association Fefac, Patrick
Vanden Avenne, said the decision would ""safeguard vital supplies
of new crop protein feeds from South America to our EU livestock
industry"".
 
 RULES STRENGTHENED
 Earlier this month the same EU committee failed to reach the
necessary majority to approve the rules, because of opposition
from some countries, including France.
 But on Tuesday France voted in favour, after the conditions
that unapproved GM crops must meet in order for the threshold to
apply were strengthened, sources close to the committee said.
""The criteria are stricter now than originally envisaged,""
said another EU diplomat.
 The GM crops in question must have been approved in a non-EU
producing country and an EU authorisation request must have been
lodged with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for at
least three months, the diplomat said.
 ""On top of that... EFSA must have given an assessment that
the presence of GM products of 0.1 percent are not detrimental
to health and environment,"" the diplomat added.
 The 0.1 percent threshold will only apply to imports of
animal feed and not human food, despite warnings from traders
and exporting states that it is impractical and costly to
separate global grain supplies into those destined for humans
and those for animals.
 A majority of EU governments are reported to be in favour of
a similar threshold for food imports, but a Commission source
said on Tuesday there were currently no plans to draft a similar
proposal for food for human consumption, but that it would
""monitor the situation closely"".

 * Britain stresses trade ties in its foreign policy
 
 By Adrian Croft
 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Libya's bloody crackdown on a
revolt against Muammar Gaddafi has embarrassed Britain, which
already faces questions about whether it sacrificed principle
for profit in its dealings with the energy producer.
 British arms exports and security ties with Libya and
Bahrain, where security forces fired on protesters last week,
have come under scrutiny as the wave of protests sweeping the
Middle East causes soul-searching in the West.
 Britain rushed to revoke more than 50 arms export licences
for Bahrain and Libya last week after criticism that British
tear gas or riot gear could be used against demonstrators.
 George Joffe, a Middle East expert at Cambridge University,
said Britain's troubled relations with Libya showed the pitfalls
of making trade a priority in foreign affairs, as he said
British governments had done for decades.
 ""If you insist on prioritising commercial relations then you
are bound to have to get into bed with some very unpleasant
people,"" Joffe told Reuters.
 Together with the United States, Britain long treated Libya
as a rogue state. The 1984 shooting of a London policewoman from
inside the Libyan embassy, the Libyan arming of IRA guerrillas
in Northern Ireland and the 1988 Lockerbie airline bombing over
Scotland, for which a Libyan was convicted, all contributed to
the branding of Gaddafi as a pariah. 
 That changed dramatically after Gaddafi agreed in 2003 to
abandon efforts to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons. British Prime Minister Tony Blair helped lead him back
back into the international fold during a landmark visit to
Tripoli in 2004, and cultivated him as an ally in the fight
against al Qaeda.
 He visited again three years later, when Libya agreed to
buy British missiles and air defence systems and oil giant BP
signed a major natural gas exploration agreement.
 
 LOCKERBIE CRISIS
 In 2009, Libya provoked a crisis in Britain's relations with
its closest ally, the United States, when Scottish authorities
freed Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the man jailed for the Lockerbie
bombing in which 270 people died.
 U.S. politicians questioned whether BP lobbied Scotland for
the release of Megrahi, sent home on compassionate grounds
because of cancer, though the company and Scottish ministers
denied it.
 An official British report this month found no conspiracy
between BP, the Scottish government and London to free Megrahi.
 But it did find that the former Labour government tried to
make it easier for Libya to seek Megrahi's release, fearing
British interests would be hurt if he died in a Scottish jail,
which would have angered Tripoli.
 Britain's Conservative-led coalition government, formed last
May after 13 years of Labour rule, says it was a mistake to free
him.
 But Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Tuesday that the
work done to turn Libya away from building weapons of mass
destruction and sponsoring international terrorism was the right
thing to do. ""Otherwise ... we would be facing an even worse
situation now,"" he said.
 British ministers condemned Libyan security forces this week
for shooting protesters in attempts to quell the uprising
against Gaddafi's 41-year rule.
 But, for years before, British governments were muted in
their criticism of Gaddafi even though U.S.-based watchdog
Freedom House, in a survey last month, gave Libya its lowest
possible rating for both political rights and civil liberties.
 ""Gaddafi ... was desperate to gain legitimacy and Tony Blair
provided Gaddafi with an opening to regain legitimacy,"" said
Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London
School of Economics.
 Gaddafi was ""one of the nastiest Middle Eastern dictators""
but his emergence from international isolation had enabled him
to shed an image of radicalism and subversion and portray
himself as a statesman, Gerges told Reuters.
 
 DEFENCE EXPORTS
 A British government report for July-September 2010 showed
it had approved licences for a long list of arms and component
exports to Libya, including teargas, crowd control ammunition,
components for surface-to-air missiles and laser rangefinders.
 Gaddafi spent a short period at a British army signals
school during his military career, but a Ministry of Defence
spokeswoman said only half a dozen Libyan officers had received
training in Britain in the last six years.
 Bahrain is a close ally of Britain in the Gulf and more than
100 Bahraini military officers have trained in Britain in the
past five years, according to press reports.
 The King of Bahrain has been invited to the wedding of
Prince William, second-in-line to the British throne, and Kate
Middleton in London in April, according to British media.
 The coalition government has made trade even more central to
its foreign policy than its predecessors.
 A high-level business delegation accompanying Prime Minister
David Cameron on a tour of Gulf countries this week has a strong
defence contingent, suggesting defence firms see good business
opportunities in the region.
 The group includes Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems,
Europe's biggest defence contractor, and representatives of
Cobham, QinetiQ, Babcock, aero engine maker Rolls-Royce and the
UK arm of French defence firm Thales.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2011 12:12PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Foreign deals put U.S. CFIUS panel in spotlight," Feb 22 (Reuters) - A German company's proposed takeover of
the New York Stock Exchange and a Chinese company's reluctant
decision to divest itself of recently acquired U.S. assets has
focused attention on the U.S. panel that reviews foreign
investment for potential national security concerns.
 Created by President Gerald Ford in 1975, Congress has
given the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States increased power over the years.
 Lawyers said Deutsche Boerse  would be prudent to
ask for a CFIUS review of its proposed takeover NYSE Euronext
 to form the world's largest exchange operator.
 The issue could turn on whether the panel views the New
York Stock Exchange as ""critical infrastructure.""
 PANEL MEMBERSHIP
 The panel is chaired by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
and its eight other voting members include Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Secretary
of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Commerce
Gary Locke and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu.
 Attorney General Eric Holder, U.S. Trade Representative Ron
Kirk and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
Director John Holdren round out the committee.
 The secretary of labor and the director of national
intelligence are nonvoting members of the committee and five
White House officials including the budget director, national
security advisor and the chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisors observe and participate ""as appropriate.""
 The ultimate decision whether to block a transaction rests
with the president but it is rare for a case to actually reach
the Oval Office. Most companies will cancel or modify a deal
before it gets to that stage.
 In a recent case, China's Huawei [HWT.UL] initially
rebuffed CFIUS's recommendation that it voluntarily divest
recently acquired U.S. server technology firm 3Leaf.
 But on Friday, it bent to the pressure and issued a
statement saying it was withdrawing its application for CFIUS
approval of the deal.
 REVIEW AND INVESTIGATION PROCESS
 CFIUS has 30 days to review a foreign acquisition, takeover
or merger for national security concerns once it has been
notified of the deal. Most cases are resolved at this stage.
 But if at least one CFIUS member determines the transaction
poses a national security threat, the committee can proceed to
a second 45-day investigation.
 An uproar erupted in 2006 when CFIUS approved Dubai Ports
World's proposed purchase of commercial port operations in six
U.S. ports then owned by British-owned Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company before launching a 45-day probe.
 CFIUS has the authority during the review or investigation
period to negotiate, impose or enforce any agreement or
conditions on the parties to mitigate any threat to the
national security of the United States.
 If concerns are not resolved by the end of the 45-day
investigation, it can recommend the president suspend or
prohibit the transaction.
 The president, who is given 15 days to issue his decision,
is not obligated to follow a recommendation to suspend or
prohibit a deal.
 WHAT'S ""COVERED"" AND WHAT'S NOT
 A covered transaction is broadly defined as any merger,
acquisition or takeover that results in foreign control of any
person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States.
 Treasury regulations also identify transactions not subject
to a CFIUS review. Those includes deals involving 10 percent or
less of a company's voting securities or ones in which the
foreign investor has ""no intention of determining or directing
the basic business decisions of the issuer.""
 Congress expanded the concept of national security in 2007
to include issues relating to homeland security, including its
application to critical infrastructure.
 Critical infrastructure is defined as systems or assets,
whether physical or cyber-based, so vital to the United States
that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating
impact on national security, including economic security.

 By Sarah Marsh and Klaus Lauer
 BERLIN, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Germany's economy will likely
grow at least 2.5 percent in 2011 and inflation will not be a
problem as long as the European Central Bank raises rates
towards year-end, a new government economic adviser said.
 ""With a forecast of 2.5 percent, we are on the safe side,""
Lars Feld told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday, tipping the
economy for faster expansion than the government has pencilled
in.
 ""We still have to wait and see whether we reach three
percent,"" said Feld, who will next month join the panel of five
'wise men' who set the guidelines for Germany's economic policy.
 Feld also said he did not expect Portugal to need euro zone
aid to overcome its debt crisis, though a debt resheduling for
Greece - struggling to meet its fiscal obligations while
enforcing austerity measures - looked inevitable.
 ""The situation of Greece is very precarious. Greek debt
could reach the level of 160 percent (of GDP) as soon as 2013 or
2014. So I assume Greece will not be able to avoid a
rescheduling,"" he said.
 Germany had staged a faster than expected recovery from its
deepest post-war recession, and the government last month raised
its 2011 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 1.8 percent.
[ID:nLDE70I0QI]
 Economic data this month pointed to a slight easing in the
recovery over the winter due to bad weather conditions, with
industry orders and output falling in December.
 Feld said, however, Europe's largest economy was now ""in a
broad, self-sustaining upswing"" -- an assessment supported by
buoyant Ifo and GfK sentiment data published this week -- though
inflation would likely temporarily weigh on private consumption.
 
 TEMPORARY INFLATION
 Feld said high liquidity and commodity prices were fuelling
inflationary pressures in the euro zone, but this was mostly
temporary and could be curbed by reducing expansionary measures
in a timely fashion.
 ""If the ECB starts manoeuvring against this towards the end
of the year, then we will be able to tackle the upwards trend in
prices again,"" he said.
 European Central Bank policymakers have sounded increasingly
aggressive on inflation this year since it topped the bank's
target of just under two percent, and Yves Mersch and Nout
Wellink said on Tuesday the bank would fight price pressures by
increasing interest rates when needed [ID:nLDE71L13A]
 ""If we have inflation a bit over 2 percent in Germany and
within the 2 percent limit in the euro zone, we can still be
satisfied and talk about price stability,"" said Feld, noting he
did not expect inflation to rise to 3 percent.
 ""I expect and hope the ECB will start raising rates towards
the end of the year.""
 German consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since
October 2008 last month and some economists fear demands for
wage hikes in the light of the strong recovery will lead to a
wage-price spiral.
 ""I hope we see reasonable agreements on wages and we
therefore don't have extra pressure on prices,"" said Feld.
 
 DEBT CRISIS MOVES
 Feld said the relative calm on financial markets showed they
were reassured by the euro zone's steps to get the debt crisis
under control and had already priced in further problems that
could arise in Ireland and Greece.
 ""If it becomes clear at some point that a (Greek) debt
rescheduling is on the cards, it should not prompt too many
worries,"" he said.
 Greece should ""try this (rescheduling) option before seeking
big negotiations with creditors,"" Feld said. 
 ""On the other hand, we could already today advise the Greeks
to perhaps... discuss (a deeper) debt restructuring with
creditors, as both German and French banks are able to absorb
such a restructuring.""
 Portugal, meanwhile, should be able to tackle its debt
problems by implementing structural reforms ""with regards to its
deficit and competitiveness"".
 ""This could be enough and should guarantee confidence on the
financial markets,"" Feld said.
 Investors fear Lisbon could be the next euro zone country to
request a European Union bailout and Portuguese bonds have been
hard hit in recent weeks.
 Portugal's government has already implemented tough
austerity measures, including cutting public sector wages and
raising taxes to deliver on its promise to cut the budget
deficit further this year to 4.6 percent of GDP.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2011 11:12AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Major sticking points in Doha round," Feb 22 (Reuters) - Negotiators at the World Trade
Organization expressed concern on Tuesday that the Doha round
trade negotiations are not moving fast enough to meet the new
deadline of a deal this year.
 The following are some of the main sticking points in the
decade-old talks for an agreement to open up world trade.
 
 AGRICULTURE -- THE ""SPECIAL SAFEGUARD MECHANISM""
 Negotiators have agreed to allow developing countries to
raise tariffs temporarily on food imports if a flood of imports
threatens to destabilise domestic producers.
 But food exporters -- both rich and poor -- say proposals by
some developing countries could allow tariffs to rise back above
even current levels, let alone where they would be cut in a Doha
deal, and do not take account of normal growth in world trade.
 Food importers such as India and Indonesia say they need a
quick, simple system to shield their farmers from trade upsets.
 The proposal may sound strange at a time when high world
food prices are prompting importers to slash tariffs for fear of
inflation or food shortages.
 But proponents say the safeguard will support food security
by ensuring that domestic farmers' livelihoods are not swept
away by sudden and unexpected trade flows.
 INDUSTRIAL GOODS - SECTOR DEALS
 The United States, European Union and Japan are keen
supporters of a proposal to eliminate tariffs, or cut them
significantly, in some sectors such as chemicals or electrical
goods, beyond any general cut in duties that is agreed.
 These sector deals would be voluntary rather than agreed by
all 153 WTO members, but the United States say they will only
make sense if big emerging economies such as China, Brazil and
India take part.
 Washington believes that such deals are where the main new
business opportunities in a Doha agreement would lie.
 So far 14 sectoral deals have been proposed.
 China and other emerging states have been reluctant to sign
up to the deals in advance, stressing their voluntary nature.
 Japan has suggested a compromise, the ""basket approach"", in
which the sectors would be subdivided, with chemicals for
example split into petrochemicals and industrial chemicals, and
countries would sign up to deals in these sub-sectors.
 This proposal has got China talking to the United States
about the idea.
 Agricultural superpower Brazil has suggested the idea could
be extended to agriculture, with for instance a sector deal
abolishing tariffs in meat, but rich food importers have shown
little enthusiasm.
 COTTON SUBSIDIES
 WTO members have agreed that rich countries should make
bigger cuts in their cotton subsidies than in their supports for
other agricultural products.
 The proposal, which particularly targets U.S. cotton
subsidies, is seen by developing countries as a touchstone of
the Doha round's ability to remove some of the distortions in
world trade that hurt poor nations.
 African cotton producers want these cuts implemented now,
but the United States says they can only come as part of an
overall deal, when the scope of farm subsidy cuts is clear.
 FISHERIES SUBSIDIES
 WTO members have agreed to cut fisheries subsidies that lead
to overfishing and the depletion of fish stocks by supporting
uneconomic activities, especially long-distance fishing.
 As with other areas of the Doha talks, differences centre on
what exceptions to this general rule should be allowed.
Developing countries will get some waivers, but in what areas,
and will some rich countries like Japan also be allowed to
continue supporting their fishermen?
 SERVICES - MARKET ACCESS
 Talks on allowing providers of services such as banking,
law, transport or telecoms to offer them to customers in other
countries have made little progress.
 Unlike most of the other negotiations, which are conducted
""multilaterally"" among all members, the services talks come down
to bilateral requests and offers between interested parties.
 One proposal, known as the ""cluster approach"", is bring the
30 or so major countries trading services together and tackle
each area -- for example logistics and credit cards, one by one.
 SPECIAL AND DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT
 This is the trade jargon way of saying that the deal must be
particularly helpful to developing countries.
 In fact the talks are officially known as the Doha
Development Agenda and at their launch in 2001 were explicitly
designed to help poor countries.
 But legislatures in the United States and other rich
countries will only ratify a deal if it offers their businesses
some new opportunities and protects politically sensitive
sectors from too much pain.

 (Adds background, comments)
 SOMERSET WEST, South Africa, Feb 22 (Reuters) - South Africa
will export 4 million tonnes of surplus maize to the world's
biggest emerging markets but wants to ensure security of food
supplies in southern Africa first, a minister said on Tuesday.
 Africa's top maize producer has been struggling to find
markets for a grain surplus after a bumper crop of 12.815
million tonnes in the 2009/10 season, its biggest yield in three
decades.
 ""We have positive responses for the exportation of our
surplus maize,"" Tina Joemat-Pettersson, minister of agriculture,
told reporters.
 ""The markets that we have developed fall within the ambit of
the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) ... (and) we
are convinced that we will be able to export our surplus,"" she
added.
 In the past week, India's finance minister has said that
South Africa had become a member of the BRIC group. China has
invited South Africa to join a summit of BRIC leaders this year
in Beijing.
 South Africa is hoping its new status among the biggest
developing countries with some of the world's fastest growth
rates will significantly improve its trade and economic
relations.
 Joemat-Pettersson said discussions on exporting the grain
surplus were centred around the logistics, such as harbour
control and that she felt the price being asked was correct.
 ""Our price is correct, our price is below the international
price. Ours is to ensure as government that we get the best
price for our farmers,"" she said.
 Joemat-Pettersson said food security for the country and the

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2011 10:28AM ET</span>",Hochtief to auction Concessions unit - sources," * Bids due as early as late April/early May - source 
 * IPO plans shelved for the time being - sources 
 * Hochtief hopes unit may fetch 1.7-2 billion euros - source
 
 FRANKFURT, Feb 22 (Reuters) - German construction group
Hochtief is seeking to start the sale of its Concessions unit in
April, shelving flotation plans for now, two financial sources
told Reuters.
 ""Potential bidders will be asked to say next month which
assets they are interested in"", one of the financial sources
with knowledge of the process told Reuters, adding bids may then
be due as early as late April or early May.
 The plan was confirmed by a second source close to the
situation.
 Hochtief is hoping the business will fetch 1.7-2 billion
euros ($2.3-$2.7 billion), the source added.
 At the end of June 2010, Hochtief valued Concessions, which
specialises in the construction and operation of airports, roads
and other public infrastructure projects, at 1.6 billion euros
($2.2 billion).
 Preparations for the sale of the business need not take a
long time as the seller and bidders can build on a
one-and-a-half year old draft. Hochtief in late 2009 scrapped
plans for a partial IPO of the Concessions unit.
 ""Much of the old prospectus, which some investors also saw
at the time, can be used for the upcoming sale,"" the first
source said.
 Industry observers expect that Hochtief will attract
interest mainly from passive financial investors such as pension
funds or insurance companies.
 ""This is not an asset for short-term oriented investors"", an
investment banker said.
 While Hochtief has shelved IPO plans for Concessions for
now, the company does not rule out such a move altogether.
 Chief Executive Herbert Luetkestratkoetter had said recently
that the company is pursuing a speedy exit and that it may come
either as a trade sale or as an IPO. 
 ""If the price tags of the bids are too low, Hochtief may
still opt for a flotation"", the investment banker said.
 Hochtief declined to comment.
 Unlike with the scrapped 2009 IPO, Hochtief has said it is
prepared to sell a majority stake in Concessions, but will still
have to find financial investors content with owning minority
stakes in its airports, where most of the unit's value rests.
 Hochtief Concessions owns 26.7 percent of Athens Airport,
37.25 percent of Budapest Airport, 20 percent of Duesseldorf
Airport, 34.8 percent of Hamburg Airport, 5.6 percent of Sydney
Airport and 47 percent of Tirana Airport, according to the
company's website.
 Hastings Funds Management has said it is looking to sell
infrastructure assets that include its 50 percent stake in
Hochtief Airport Capital, which also owns stakes in the airports
of Duesseldorf, Hamburg, Sydney and Athens. 
 If it succeeds it would help Hochtief in its pitch to
investors.

 * Focused on corporates, sales, not ""nitty gritty"" of deals
 * Goldman stint was seen as no obstacle to FSB presidency
 By Gavin Jones and Douwe Miedema
 ROME/LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Critics of Mario Draghi
may have few arguments to block his chances of becoming Europe's
top central banker other than just mentioning the fact that he
worked at Goldman Sachs  for a number of years.
 So powerful is the memory of the financial crisis and the
role that investment banks played in it, that the Italian's time
at the world's best known -- and often maligned -- investment
bank is seen by some as a threat to his hopes.
 But there was nothing sinister about the 63-year old's time
at Goldman, several people who worked with Draghi at the bank
have told Reuters. His role was primarily to win business among
corporate clients through his strong contact book.
 ""In 2003 and 2004, Goldman Sachs did everything that
happened in Italy and that had a lot to do with Draghi,"" said
one banker who advised Draghi when he was at the Italian
Treasury, and later worked for him at Goldman.
 ""My team did the groundwork, but he was essential in
providing advice to clients,"" this person said.
 Goldman Sachs and Draghi declined comment.
 Since last month's shock withdrawal of Bundesbank President
Axel Weber, most analysts say Draghi is left as the best
qualified and, for the moment, only obvious candidate to take
over the top spot at the European Central Bank in October.
 Yet many are still loath to see the hugely powerful job go
to a southern European country with a history of high inflation
and wayward public finances.
 For these critics, who cannot publicly admit nationality is
an issue, Draghi's time as a Goldman managing director from 2002
to 2006 risks becoming the only obstacle they can raise.
 ""I don't think people can point to anything specific on
what Draghi did at Goldman,"" said Citibank analyst Giada Giani.
 ""It's just that investment banking in general is now
associated with financial crisis, sub-prime investments and too
much risk,"" she said.
 GREEK SWAPS
 Goldman Sachs's role in swap operations conducted for the
Greek government in the early 2000s that helped Greece mask the
size of its public debt provide a handle for Draghi's critics --
even if these deals were legal at the time and he was not
involved in them.
 ""For someone aiming high in the public sphere, work
experience at the top levels of Goldman Sachs is fast becoming a
toxic asset,"" former International Monetary Fund chief economist
Simon Johnson wrote in his blog last year.
 ""You can pretty much count Mr Draghi out of the running for
the ECB job,"" he said at the time.
 But a year after Johnson said that, Draghi's cards are
excellent, and he's now widely seen as the favourite to replace
ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet.
 The Bank of Italy, which Draghi now heads, said he had no
role in the controversial Greek foreign exchange swap, which in
any case took place in 2001, before he joined Goldman.
 Another source with direct knowledge of Draghi's work said
he focused on the corporate sector with clients in numerous
countries and had a broad, not a specialist, remit which often
included debt restructuring, corporate strategies and market
placements.
 His prestige as a former World Bank executive and Italian
Treasury director general often won Goldman business.
 ""He often came along to meetings with company CEOs just to
exchange interesting ideas, sometimes he knew them before and
sometimes he didn't,"" this banker said.
 Another senior banker who worked at Goldman during Draghi's
time there, said he operated at a ""very high level"" and did not
get involved in the ""nitty gritty"" of deals.
 ""He was one of the finest bankers I met at Goldman. He was
incredibly smart but operated with honesty and integrity,"" said
this source, who has since left Goldman.
 Citigroup's Giani said Draghi's time at Goldman should be
seen an advantage, as it gives him the direct experience of how
markets work that many policymakers lack.
 That view seems to be winning ground even in Germany, where
resistance to an Italian ECB chief is widespread.
 Former German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck, who had
himself been touted as possible ECB candidate, last month
described Draghi as ""first rate"" and said his Goldman experience
should be seen as an asset rather than a drawback.
 Another problem for Draghi's critics is that for the last
three years he has won wide praise as head of the Financial
Stability Board (FSB), charged with coordinating global
financial regulation since the 2008-09 crisis.
 ""People asked me to chair the FSB because I had market
experience,"" Draghi said recently.
 He no doubt also had other credentials for the job, but it
will be hard for opponents to argue that having worked for
Goldman should disqualify him from the ECB presidency when it
helped to qualify him for the presidency of the FSB.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled
and safe-haven assets rose on Tuesday as revolt in Libya drove
oil prices to 30-month highs, prompting fears unrest could
spread to other major oil suppliers and disrupt global growth.
 Crude oil prices rallied in New York and London, where
prices for North Sea Brent  touched a high of $108.57 a
barrel before paring some gains as concerns about oil supplies
chilled the appetite for assets perceived as risky. For details
see: [ID:nLDE71L0ZE]
 Libya's Muammar Gaddafi used tanks, helicopters and
warplanes to fight a growing revolt, witnesses said on Tuesday,
and refugees fleeing into Egypt told of a wave of violence and
crime. [ID:nL3E7DM0K1]
 In Tripoli, residents told Reuters there was no visible
security force presence on the streets, a day after reports
that warplanes had bombed portions of the capital and
mercenaries had shot civilians.
 Libya is by no means the world's largest oil producer,
ranking third in Africa after Nigeria and Angola, but investors
expressed concern about the spread of violence and a serious
disruption to supply.
 ""Risk aversion is the name of the game. The (situation) in
the Middle East is clearly having a major impact on market
sentiment generally,"" said Peter Dixon, economist at
Commerzbank, who added reaction might be overdone.
 ""Hopefully as conditions begin to settle down again, we'll
start to see the fundamentals reassert themselves.""
 Widespread risk aversion boosted the Swiss franc and
prompted strong flows into U.S. and German government debt.
Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's all-country world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.2 percent and much of Wall Street opened
more than 1 percent lower.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 73.79
points, or 0.60 percent, at 12,317.46. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 13.49 points, or 1.00 percent, at
1,329.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 42.14

 The euro was steady versus the dollar as hawkish comments
from a European Central Bank official helped it pare earlier

 The euro  was up 0.01 percent at $1.3676, while the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> was up 0.02 percent at 77.704.
 The dollar  was unchanged at 83.11.
 U.S. crude prices jumped, in part because electronic
trading of the contract occurred on Monday, but there was no
settlement close as the exchange in New York was closed for the
Presidents Day holiday.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $5.44 to $91.64 a
barrel.
 Shorter-dated German bond yields rose to their highest in
about two weeks, and U.S. Treasury prices also gained.

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
14/32 in price to yield 3.53 percent.
 Gold prices slipped but remained above $1,400 an ounce as
the dollar surrendered its earlier 1 percent gains versus the
euro, with violence in Libya fueling interest in the metal as a

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2011 09:56AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-A risk sell-off that was waiting to happen," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Without disparaging the
seriousness of revolts sweeping the Arab world or the
potential damage to global growth from soaring oil prices, risk
investors may be getting what they wanted -- an excuse to sell.
 Heading into the current Libya-focused turmoil, there were
numerous signs that equity markets in particular were getting
ahead of themselves and into the kind of territory that usually
prompts talk of a correction.
 These range from a series of new highs, to short hedge fund
positioning and drained institutional cash balances.
 A sell off could now be under way, with global equities as
measured by MSCI falling as much as 1.4 percent from a 30-month
high reached just last Friday.
 Some welcome it.
 ""It's healthy for the market to take a breather after such
strong gains,"" Jacques Henry, analyst at Louis Capital Markets
in Paris, said on Tuesday as a wave of risk aversion swept
markets, triggering flows into the likes of U.S. Treasuries and
the Swiss franc.
 This is not to say that what Alastair Newton of Nomura calls
a tsunami sweeping across sometimes oil-rich Arab countries does
not bring broader dangers.
 Rising oil prices threaten inflation in countries that are
already feeling growing price pressure, prompting central banks
to consider interest rate rises.
They eat into corporate profits and can slow growth in
energy-dependent countries, some of which are still only
experiencing tentative economic recovery.
 And that is even before any dust has settled and new
governments are in place, presumably with new allegiances and
policies.
 But it does mean that any sell-off should be looked at in
terms of where markets were as well as what risks the Middle
East/North Africa protests now bring.
 
 SIGNPOSTS TO SELL
 Investors have been on a risk rampage since mid-2010 when it
became clear that the U.S. Federal Reserve was going to pump up
liquidity with a massive quantitative easing programme.
 It has been fuelled by increasing economic health,
particularly in the United States, but also in powerhouse
economies such as Germany and China.
Since the beginning of July, global stocks have risen more
than 30 percent. As of Friday's high, they were up more than 6
percent for this year alone.
 In a number of cases, stock index gains in the first half
dozen or so weeks of his year were close to what analysts
predicted they would be in all of 2011.
 This has left many with huge exposure to equities. Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch's monthly fund manager poll, the most
bullish in a decade, showed a net 67 percent of respondents were
overweight equities in early February.
 BofA-Merrill said these were ""extreme"" levels and that there
were warnings in the survey.
 Average cash holdings fell to 3.5 percent, a level that
triggers an equity sell signal on BofA's model.
 At the same time, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission shows hedge funds turning into net short
sellers of the S&P 500 U.S. stock index as of Feb. 15.
 It prompted Societe Generale to warn that ""technical factors
suggest a correction is likely"".
 A similar theme can be seen in demand for options to sell
Germany's DAX index.
 The two indexes have gained as much as 6.9 percent and 7.6
percent, respectively, this year.
 
 RISK STILL ON
 So Libya and the oil spike may be just the trigger investors
needed to pare down their exposure to risk. The monthly Reuters
asset allocation poll due next Monday should give some idea of
how much they have done so.
 The question for investors, however, will be whether the
current troubles turn into something longer-lasting that
requires a reappraisal of the consensus bet on a recovering
global economy.
 For now, the level of losses do not suggest that. Indeed
most investors at the moment are probably only taking a step
back.
 The key will be oil, as Charles Robertson, head of macro
strategy at Renaissance Capital, suggested:
 ""An average oil price for the year of $150 a barrel would be
as painful as the oil-price hit felt in 1980, when the Iranian
revolution pushed the global oil bill to nearly 8 percent of
GDP. But economies can cope with a short-lived spike.""

 * Euro pares losses on hawkish ECB Mersch comments
 * Libya violence fuels risk aversion, helps USD, CHF
 * New Zealand dollar suffers after earthquake
(Adds comment, details, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The dollar and Swiss franc
rose against most currencies on Tuesday, with gains seen
accelerating, as geopolitical turmoil in Libya, the third
largest oil producer in Africa, fueled a flight from risky
assets.
 Big moves in the spot market pushed up implied volatility
in major currencies, with euro one-week vols jumping to 12.5
percent.
 The Swiss franc's one-month implied volatility also surged
to a roughly two-week high 11.20 percent.
 The euro, on the other hand, recovered from losses after
hawkish comments from European Central Bank officials, further
increasing rate hike expectations that should enhance the
appeal of euro-denominated assets.
 Risk aversion remained the dominant theme, however, after
the defiance of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the face of
mounting public revolt stoked uncertainty and prompted a supply
cut from one of the world's major oil exporters.
 ""We have a broad sense of risk aversion that is undermining
some of the higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian
dollar amid the spreading turmoil in Libya,"" said Omer Esiner,
chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in
Washington.
 ""The U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc are certainly
outperforming some of the risky currencies and the majors.""
 In early New York trading, the U.S. dollar rose 0.6 percent
against the Australian dollar to US$1.0030.
 The dollar was up around 0.1 percent at 77.742 against a
currency basket, but it was well below the day's high of
78.326.
 The Swiss franc was broadly firmer, with the euro down 0.8
percent at 1.2842 francs, having earlier dropped as low as
1.2793 francs, its weakest since late January. The franc also
rose against the U.S. dollar, which fell 0.9 percent yo 0.9386
francs.
 The euro, which had earlier fallen as much as one percent
against the dollar, cut its losses, however, after ECB
policymaker Yves Mersch was quoted saying the central bank may
have to adjust its language on inflation.
 The ECB's Nout Wellink was also quoted expressing concerns
about inflation.
 These comments followed recent hawkish rhetoric from
various ECB officials, including policymakers Juergen Stark and
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, which have highlighted the prospect of the
ECB raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
 The euro was flat at $1.3677, well above an earlier low of
$1.3525, on electronic trading platform EBS.
 However, analysts said any further escalation of troubles
in Libya or the Middle East could quickly encourage investors
to resume cutting exposure to riskier assets.
 ""There has been a sharp rally in euro/dollar on the Mersch
comments which caught the market the wrong way round, but it
looks overdone,"" said Ankita Dudani, G10 currency strategist at
RBS.
 Oil prices, meanwhile, rallied to 2 1/2-year highs on fears
the unrest in Libya could spread to other major Middle East oil
producers.
 Higher oil prices are seen weighing on global growth,
particularly in emerging countries heavily dependent on oil and
commodity imports. Rising prices have already led to higher
inflation, which can threaten vulnerable economies.
 The New Zealand dollar tumbled to US$0.7455, its weakest
since late December. It was last down 1.9 percent at US$0.7495.
Speculation that the economic damage caused by an earthquake
which rocked the country's second biggest city
may increase the chance of an interest rate cut.

 * Credible resource estimates in 3-4 years
 * Fees yet to be decided
 
 By Patryk Wasilewski and Gabriela Baczynska
 WARSAW, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Ongoing investments in shale gas
exploration in Poland are likely to bear fruit in 2020 or later,
and credible estimates of production levels are still some four
years away, a deputy environment minister told Reuters.
 Major oil and gas companies mainly from the United States
including Chevron and Exxon Mobil have bought licences to search
for unconventional gas in northern and eastern Poland. So far
Poland has awarded some 70 licenses.
 ""In four years, maybe three, we will know how much shale gas
there is in Poland when exploration under already awarded
licences is finished,"" Henryk Jacek Jezierski said in an
interview on Tuesday.
 ""Production is certainly not possible in 2012, rather 2020,
if not later,"" he added.
 The comments poured cold water on some forecasts that
production of shale gas could start as soon as 2012 after
Canada's BNK Petroleum found gas on one of its concessions.
 Jezierski said several license proceedings were continuing
but that the most sought-after areas were already awarded.
 He added that once the exploration phase ends, but before
the start of production, each of the license holders will have
to pass environment checks and seek the ministry's approval to
continue with production.
 ""Most mining is damaging to the environment, but we have to
find a compromise. In case of shale gas the compromise will be
found at an acceptable level of impact on nature,"" he said.
 Environment hurdles are not the only thing that yet has to
be decided. The government will wait to see how much
unconventional gas is available before negotiating fees for its
extraction.
 ""In Poland the state owns all the shale gas. As companies
move into the production phase, they will be signing deals
covering their right to use it,"" Jezierski said. ""The price will
depend on how much gas there is.""

 CCS
 Poland's environment ministry is set to oversee the impact
of Poland's key investments in the energy sector from shale gas,
carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear energy.
 Jezierski strongly encouraged Polish utilities to develop
CCS technology in order to help the country curb its carbon
emissions, even if the technology at the moment is still in its
infancy and has not reached economic viability.
 ""Poland, as a country with over 90 percent of energy
production from coal, cannot afford not to test out this
technology. We should pick up the challenge and try it out,""
Jezierski added.

 By Adrian Bathgate	
 CHRISTCHURCH, Feb 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand rescue teams
worked under search lights early Wednesday to find scores of
people trapped under collapsed buildings after an earthquake
struck the country's second-biggest city of Christchurch,
killing at least 65 people.	
 About 120 survivors have already been rescued from the
rubble, but the death toll is expected to rise following the
second strong quake to hit the city of almost 400,000 people in
five months.	
 ""We may well be witnessing New Zealand's darkest day...The
death toll I have at the moment is 65 and that may rise,"" said
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who had flown to his home
town of Christchurch, where he still has family.	
 Tuesday's 6.3 magnitude quake struck at lunchtime, when
streets and shops thronged with people and offices were still
occupied. It was New Zealand's most deadly natural disaster for
80 years.	
 Rescuers, working under lights in rain, focused on two
collapsed buildings: a financial-services office block whose
four stories pancaked on top of each other, and a TV building
which also housed an English-language school.	
 About a dozen Japanese students at the school were believed
to be missing, an official in Japan told Reuters, while public
broadcaster NHK said several other students from another group
in the building were also unaccounted for.	
 Trapped survivors could be heard shouting out to rescuers
from the TV building. Local media say as many as a dozen or more
people could still be inside. Relatives of those feared trapped
kept a vigil outside the building as rain began to fall.	
 ""All of our energy tonight is really focused on the need to
rescue people,"" said Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker, estimating
120 people had been pulled out of rubble or rescued so far. 
 A woman freed from a collapsed building said she had waited
for six hours for rescuers to reach her after the quake, which
was followed by at least 20 aftershocks. 
 ""I thought the best place was under the desk but the ceiling
collapsed on top, I can't move and I'm just terrified,"" office
worker Anne Voss told TV3 news by mobile phone.	
 
 Christchurch Mayor Parker described the city, a historic
tourist town popular with overseas students, as a war zone. He
told local radio that up to 200 could be trapped in buildings
but later revised that estimate down to around 100 or so.	
 It was the country's worst natural disaster since a 1931
quake in the North Island city of Napier which killed 256.
Christchurch Hospital saw an influx of injured residents.	
 ""They are largely crushes and cuts types of injuries and
chest pain as well,"" said David Meates, head of the Canterbury
Health Board. Some of the more seriously injured could be
evacuated to other cities, he added.	
 
 HISTORIC CATHEDRAL IN RUINS 
 On the way into the city, a Reuters correspondent saw
buckled roads, toppled buildings and big pools of water. Police
and the army were patrolling the streets.	
 Christchurch has been described as a little piece of
England.	
 It has an iconic cathedral, now largely destroyed, and a
river called the Avon. It had many historic stone buildings, and
is popular with English-language students and also with tourists
as a springboard for tours of the scenic South Island.	
 Emergency shelters had also been set up in local schools and
at a race course. Helicopters dumped water to try to douse a
fire in one tall office building, while a crane was used to help
workers trapped in another office block.	
 ""I was in the square right outside the cathedral -- the
whole front has fallen down and there were people running from
there. There were people inside as well,"" said John Gurr, a
camera technician who was in the city centre when the quake hit.	
 Aerial TV footage of surroundings suburbs showed
once-elegant homes in ruins and roads cut off by huge boulders.	
 There have been offers of help from the United States and
Japan, while neighbouring Australia is sending 148 search and
rescue specialists, including sniffer dogs. Britain's Queen
Elizabeth offered her sympathy and said in a statement she was
""utterly shocked"" by news of the quake.	
 
 STREETS TURN INTO QUICKSAND	
 Christchurch is built on silt, sand and gravel, with a water
table beneath. In a quake, the water rises, mixing with the sand
and turning the ground into a swamp, swallowing up roads and
cars.	
 TV footage showed sections of road that had collapsed into a
milky, sand-coloured lake beneath the surface. One witness
described the footpaths as like ""walking on sand"".	
 Unlike last year's even stronger tremor, which struck early
in the morning when streets were virtually empty, people were
walking or driving along streets when the shallow tremor struck,
sending awnings and the entire faces of buildings crashing down.	
 Police said debris had rained down on two buses, crushing
them, but there was no word on any casualties.	
 Fears that the quake could dent confidence in the country's
already fragile economy knocked the New Zealand dollar down by
about 1.8 percent from late U.S. levels to $0.75 .	
 Westpac Bank raised the possibility that the central bank
could cut interest rates over the next few weeks in a bid to
shore up the economy, while other banks pushed out their
expectations for the timing of the next rate increase.	
 ANZ now expects the central bank to keep rates on hold until
the first quarter of 2012.	
 Shares in Australian banks and insurers, which typically
have large operations in New Zealand, fell after the quake.	
 The quake hit at 12:51 pm (2351 GMT Monday) at a depth of
only 4 km (2.5 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.	
 The tremor was centred about 10 km (six miles) southwest of
Christchurch, which had suffered widespread damage during last
September's 7.1 magnitude quake but no deaths.	
 New Zealand sits between the Pacific and Indo-Australian
tectonic plates and records on average more than 14,000
earthquakes a year, of which about 20 would normally top
magnitude 5.0.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to their highest
in 2-1/2 years on Tuesday as investors worried that violence in
Libya could spread to other top producers in the Middle East,
while the strength of the dollar dented gold and base metals.
 In agricultural commodities, arabica coffee futures hit
fresh 13-1/2 year highs, boosted by a shortage of good-quality
beans, while cocoa futures scaled new 32-year peaks.
 Perceived safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries and the
Swiss franc gained at the expense of more growth-linked markets
such as equities, which fell back from their recent 29-month
highs in Europe, and industrial metals such as copper.
 Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi signalled defiance of a
mounting revolt against his 41-year rule on Tuesday, appearing
on state television and denying he had fled the country.
 His forces have cracked down on anti-government
demonstrators, with fighting now spreading to the capital
Tripoli after erupting in Libya's oil-producing east last week.
 U.S. crude futures hit a 2-1/2 year high on Tuesday on
concern the violence could cut more of the OPEC-member's output
and similar events could happen in neighbouring nations.
 ""Libya alone doesn't produce so much oil that there would be
a supply shortage ... even if there was a total collapse,"" said
Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank. 
 ""It produces around 1.6 million barrels of oil per day, and
OPEC has spare capacity of up to 6 million barrels, so it is
more fears that this might spread to places like Algeria, Kuwait
or the United Arab Emirates,"" he added.
 Libya is the third-largest oil producer in Africa and at
least some 100,000 barrels per day -- about 6 percent of the
country's production -- have been shut in.
 U.S. crude for April delivery touched its highest since
October 2008 at $98.48 a barrel before easing back to $96.14 a
barrel, still up on the day.
 Brent crude for April rose $1.46 to $107.21 a barrel by 1230
GMT, after climbing as high as $108.57 in early trade.
 Industrialised countries will consider a coordinated release
of oil from stocks to meet any supply disruption stemming from
the political turmoil in the Middle East, Fatih Birol, chief
economist of the International Energy Agency, said.
 
 GOLD DIPS
 With risk aversion running high, gold has been a beneficiary
of steady safe-haven buying by investors seeking an alternative
to volatile currencies, bonds or stocks and also as a safeguard
against rising inflation stemming from stronger crude prices.
 On Tuesday, the gold price fell by 0.7 percent after six
straight days of gains as the impact of the stronger dollar
outweighed the boost from purchases made on the back of the
uncertainty surrounding the Middle East.
 ""It's not all one-way traffic,"" said Credit Agricole analyst
Robin Bhar. ""Obviously, we've had the turmoil escalating in the
region and jitters and it's all understandable. Maybe this is
the top for the time being.""
 He added, ""Those safe-havens -- the dollar, Treasuries and
gold -- should stay in demand, and other riskier assets such as
equities and copper and so on will get sold off, as we've seen
in the last 12 hours or so.""
 Spot gold was last down 0.6 percent on the day at $1,397.50
an ounce, having risen on Monday to its highest in nearly seven
weeks, and was still set for a near-5 percent gain this month.
 Gold, like Treasuries and the Swiss franc, tends to attract
investors in times of political or financial turmoil as it did
in 2010 with the euro zone debt crisis.
 Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange hit three-week
lows on Tuesday as the unrest in the Middle East curbed
investors' appetite for risk, although they were still within
sight of last week's record high at $10,190 a tonne.
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
was last quoted at $9,660 a tonne, compared with $9,810 at the
close of business on Monday.
 In agricultural commodities, ICE May arabica coffee futures
rose 0.6 percent to $2.7440 per lb, having risen to a high of
$2.7800, marking a fresh 13-1/2-year peak.
 Tight supply of arabica coffee has emerged as a result of
several below-par harvests from key producer Colombia and the
resulting rise in price has encouraged roasters to increase the
volume of cheaper robusta beans in blends where possible.
 May cocoa futures on ICE stood $38 or 1.1 percent higher at
$3,537 a tonne after rising earlier to a 32-year peak for the
second month of $3,574.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The euro was steady versus the
dollar on Tuesday as hawkish comments from a European Central
Bank official helped it pare earlier steep losses as escalating
tensions in Libya prompted investors to seek safer assets.
 Risk aversion gripped markets, lifting the dollar and the
Swiss franc, after the defiance of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
in the face of a mounting public revolt stoked uncertainty and
prompted a supply cut in one of the world's major oil exporters.
[ID:nLDE71L0ER]
 The euro, which had earlier fallen as much as one percent
against the dollar, cut its losses, however, after ECB
policymaker Yves Mersch was quoted saying the central bank may
have to adjust its language on inflation. [ID:nWEB0672]
 The ECB's Nout Wellink was also quoted expressing concerns
about inflation. [ID:nWEB0708]
 These comments followed recent hawkish rhetoric from various
ECB officials, including policymakers Juergen Stark and Lorenzo
Bini Smaghi, which have highlighted the prospect of the ECB
raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
 However, analysts said any further escalation of troubles in
Libya or the Middle East could quickly encourage investors to
resume cutting exposure to riskier assets.
 ""There has been a sharp rally in euro/dollar on the Mersch
comments which caught the market the wrong way round, but it
looks overdone,"" said Ankita Dudani, G10 currency strategist at
RBS.
 ""Events in the Middle East and Libya are definitely on
everyone's radar and markets are becoming very wary of risk.
 The euro  was steady at $1.3673, well above an earlier
low of $1.3527.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 77.727 against a currency
basket <.DXY>, but it was well below the day's high of 78.326.
 The Swiss franc was broadly firmer, with the euro 
down 0.7 percent at 1.2864 francs, having earlier dropped as low
as 1.2793 francs, its weakest since late January.
 Markets also become more risk-averse on news of an
earthquake that rocked New Zealand's second biggest city and
sent the New Zealand dollar to a near two-month low against its
U.S. counterpart. [ID:nL3E7DM055]
 The euro cut losses against the yen, trading slightly up on
the day at 113.75 yen .
 OIL PRICE RALLY
 Oil prices rallied to 2 1/2-year highs on fears the unrest
in Libya could spread to other major Middle East oil producers.
 Higher oil prices are seen weighing on global growth,
particularly in emerging countries heavily dependent on oil and
commodity imports. Rising prices have already led to higher
inflation, which can threaten vulnerable economies.
 However, analysts said any sign of a calming of the
situation could see the focus in FX markets switch back to
interest rate differentials.
 ""If the region stabilises and tensions don't spread beyond
Libya, and if there is a perception the region is going to be
under control ... I think we will return to the risk-on,
monetary policy-driven trade,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman, head
of EMEA FX strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank.

 By James Pomfret and Farah Master
 HONG KONG, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The pace of the yuan's
convertibility may accelerate as global demand grows for trade
settlement in the Chinese currency, a Chinese central bank
official said on Tuesday.
 ""If you look at the history and the progress of
international use of our renminbi (yuan), you find that
sometimes demand grows very quickly,"" said Xing Yujing, deputy
director general of the monetary policy department of the
People's Bank of China.
 ""If there's demand from the market in order to facilitate
trade and investment, the change may be quicker than we imagined
before,"" Xing told an economic conference held by Goldman Sachs
in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
 Xing is a senior policymaker for China's central bank,
overseeing China's yuan internationalisation and currency rate
policies.
 China is seeking to promote the use of the yuan overseas as
part of a longer-term plan to make it an international reserve
currency along with the U.S. dollar, analysts say.
 Some analysts said the PBOC comments were unusually candid.
 ""These comments mean the authorities are keen to liberalise
the trade settlement process and allow more trade to be settled
in yuan. Approval process for remitting funds back into the
mainland may be eased and we might see more volumes,"" said Banny
Lam, economist at CCB International in Hong Kong.
 Beijing's promotion of Hong Kong as an offshore yuan trading
hub has resulted in a flurry of yuan-denominated corporate bonds
also known as dim-sum bonds, banks creating new structured
products, and more Chinese importers settling trade in renminbi.
 Challenges remain, however, including a need to improve the
secondary trading of yuan products in Hong Kong, and to speed up
the yuan remittance process for investing in China.
 Speaking at the same event, Hong Kong Monetary Authority
Deputy Chief Executive Peter Pang said the growth potential for
foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into China from yuan
bond issuance in Hong Kong was huge and could double from last
year.
 ""Hong Kong's investment of $46 billion in 2009 accounted for
nearly 50 percent of total mainland FDI. FDI in the mainland
financed by renminbi bonds issued in Hong Kong was less than 2
billion yuan ($304.3 million) last year, or 1.5 percent of total
mainland FDI, so the potential for growth is really huge,"" he
said.
 Pang said that should 10 percent of China's total FDI be
financed by yuan bonds in Hong Kong in future, it would ""almost
double"" Hong Kong's yuan bond issuance to 66 billion yuan from
36 billion last year.
 An HKMA spokeswoman later clarified that Pang's comments
weren't a forecast but rather a hypothetical projection.
 Yuan deposits in Hong Kong reached 315 billion yuan at the
end of December last year, dwarfing the roughly 80 billion yuan
of outstanding ""dim sum bonds"", a trend that is expected to
continue to underscore the supply-demand mismatch.
 Yuan shares listed in Hong Kong may be just around the
corner with Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd's yuan REIT expected
soon.

 * Hopeful stronger euro zone fund can be agreed in March
 * Bundesbank's Weber sees no need for stronger EFSF fund
 
 By Fiona Ortiz and Luke Baker
 MADRID/BRUSSELS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Spain is confident euro
zone leaders will agree to strengthen their multi-billion euro
rescue fund at a summit next month, but European Central Bank
member Axel Weber said enough has been done already.
 In an interview with Reuters, Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said Madrid was convincing markets Spain
was getting its economy in order, and said he was confident
Germany would support a stronger euro zone fund despite
Chancellor Angela Merkel's domestic problems.
 ""We are winning the battle, but I still have my guard up
because we have to implement all the reforms that have generated
more confidence,"" Zapatero told Reuters Insider television.
 The euro zone's 17 leaders will meet in Brussels on March 11
to discuss strengthening the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro fund set up last May and
used to bail out Ireland, among other issues.
 Germany remains reluctant to back an increase in the EFSF's
effective capacity from around 250 billion euros to the full 440
billion because of domestic opposition to the move, but Zapatero
said he was hopeful of Merkel's support in the end.
 ""I am confident, confident in the capacity and commitment of
Chancellor Merkel,"" he said. ""We know this is a very intense
electoral year in Germany, but I am confident.""
 Merkel's Christian Democrats suffered a crushing defeat in a
regional election in the northern German city-state of Hamburg
on Sunday, narrowing her leeway to sanction more euro zone
assistance given the German public's reluctance to support it.

 Reuters Insider interview with Zapatero:
 http://link.reuters.com/naf28r
 For multimedia coverage of the euro zone crisis page on
 Reuters Top News: http://r.reuters.com/hus75h
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 An expectation has emerged among EU policymakers that
Germany will support a strengthened EFSF if the rest of the euro
zone agrees measures Berlin is pressing to make their economies
more competitive.
 Those proposals and others on broader economic governance
are expected to be included in a ""comprehensive package"" that EU
leaders will discuss and hope to agree at a summit on March
24/25, possibly drawing a line under the year-long debt crisis.
 But Weber, the outgoing head of the Bundesbank and an
influential voice in the euro zone debt debate, wrote in a
column in the Financial Times on Tuesday that current measures
to tackle the crisis had gone far enough and no major
adjustments to the existing rescue fund were required.
 ""Against this backdrop, the existing instruments for
short-term crisis resolution are adequate and, despite repeated
demands to the contrary, should not undergo significant
adjustment,"" he wrote.
 Yields on Spanish and other peripheral euro zone bonds rose
on Tuesday, but it was more a reflection of unrest across North
Africa, which prompted investors to seek safer assets such as
German Bunds, traders said.
 
 PORTUGAL ON THE SPOT
While Spain has taken steps to overhaul its economy that
appear to have convinced markets that the worst may be over --
the spread of Spanish 10-year government bonds over German bunds
has fallen around 30 basis points in the past month -- Portugal
remains a point of concern.
 A euro zone source told Reuters last week that there was now
a consensus among EU member states that Portugal would have to
seek a bailout by April, and that view remains common among
officials in Brussels.
 However, Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos
Santos told Japan's Nikkei newspaper during a visit to Tokyo he
believed the country would continue to be able to fund itself in
the markets without seeking euro zone aid.
 ""Portugal is tackling fiscal rebuilding to achieve its
fiscal reform targets. The situation is different from Greece
and Ireland,"" he was quoted as telling Japanese officials.
 Portugal has around 4.3 billion euros of bonds falling due
in April and another 4.9 billion in June. A portion of that debt
may be sold in private placements in Asia, with both China and
Japan having indicated that they could buy euro zone bonds.
 Since Portugal's immediate funding needs to not fall until
April, it can afford to wait until EU leaders meet to discuss
their ""comprehensive package"" at the end of March to see if a
deal then calms financial markets and provides a reprieve.
 If the package does not include a strengthening of the EFSF
-- which could disappoint financial markets, which want to see
that the euro zone is prepared to put more money behind the fund
-- that could pile further pressure on Lisbon.
 Reflecting broad concern, the head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, Thomas Mirow, told Germany's
Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Tuesday: ""I think that Portugal needs
help to solve its debt problems.""
 If Portugal were to need a bailout, senior euro zone
officials have indicated it would need between 80 and 90 billion
euros of aid, meaning there would be more than enough in the
EFSF, even if its effective lending capacity is not increased.
 The concern then would be whether there is enough to bail
out Spain or any other euro zone state were they to need it.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday while
the dollar rallied broadly after escalating political tension in
Libya prompted selling in higher-yielding assets for the safety
of the U.S. currency and also the Swiss franc.
 The New Zealand dollar hit a near two-month low against its
U.S. counterpart on speculation that the economic damage caused
by an earthquake which rocked the country's second biggest city
may increase the chance of an interest rate cut.
 Risk aversion gripped the currency market after the defiance
of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the face of a mounting
public revolt stoked political uncertainty and prompted a supply
cut in one of the world's major oil exporters.
 ""Investors are scaling down on exposure across the board,""
said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm.
 ""Libya is the first major oil-exporting country to be
affected ... if this spreads to other oil-exporting countries,
it will not be a good sign.""
 The euro fell as much as 1 percent on the day to $1.3527,
according to Reuters data.
 The single currency clawed back from losses, climbing to
around $1.3635 by 1043 GMT, as traders cited Asian demand,
including sovereign names.
 Market participants said a media report quoting European
Central Bank policymaker Yves Mersch saying he would not be
surprised if the central bank soon adjusts its language on
inflation helped to push the euro up.
 The move underlined the market's ongoing focus on rising
inflation risks and their impact on global interest rates.
 
 EXPORT CONCERNS
 Oil prices rallied, keeping Brent crude near $108 per barrel
after it hit a 2 1/2-year high on Monday, while U.S. crude
jumped 9 percent.
 Higher oil prices are seen weighing on global growth,
particularly in emerging countries heavily dependent on oil and
commodity imports. Rising prices have already led to higher
inflation, which can threaten vulnerable economies.
 Analysts said the mix of oil into tensions in the Middle
East and North Africa prompted a bigger FX reaction to events in
Libya than overthrows of governments in Tunisia and Egypt.
 Once knee-jerk risk aversion subsided, some said investors
would focus on the impact of festering violence in Libya on oil
supply channels, as well as any spread in political opposition
to Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter.
 Big moves in the spot market cranked up implied volatility
in major currencies, with euro one-week vols jumping above 11
percent, from around 9.4 percent on Monday.
 The New Zealand dollar tumbled more than 2 percent on the
day to $0.7469, its weakest since late December.
 Market participants said the currency extended losses after
Westpac Bank said New Zealand's central bank may cut rates to
shore up confidence, adding that a rate cut may occur at or
before a policy meet next month.

 DOLLAR CORRECTION
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 78.148 against a currency
basket, hovering above a two-month low of 76.881 hit earlier
this month.
 The dollar's high liquidity attracted risk-averse investors
despite issues which have been plaguing the currency, including
speculation that U.S. interest rates would stay low, and
concerns about the country's growing deficits.
 Audrey Childe-Freeman, head of EMEA FX strategy at JPMorgan
Private Bank, said geopolitical tensions had sparked a dollar
correction, but added it was unclear how long this may last.
 ""If the region stabilises and tensions don't spread beyond
Libya, and if there is a perception the region is going to be
under control ... I think we will return to the risk-on,
monetary policy-driven trade,"" she said.
 The single currency fell 1 percent on the day to 1.2793
Swiss francs, pushing the traditional safe-haven currency to its
strongest since late January.
 The yen, which often benefits in times of geopolitical
concerns, rose, taking in its stride a warning on its sovereign
rating by agency Moody's.
 The euro fell more than 1 percent to 112.24 yen, brushing
off concerns that higher oil prices could have a deep impact on
the Japanese economy, which is heavily reliant on oil imports.
The dollar slipped 0.3 percent 82.85 yen.

 KIEV, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Hard frosts across Ukraine have not
affected Ukrainian winter grain crops, Farm Minister Mykola

 ""Everything is going well. There is nothing to be concerned
about,"" Prysyazhnyuk told reporters. ""We have some worries about

 Temperatures fell last week to as low as 20 degrees below

but analysts said winter grain crops are protected by snow.
 Agriculture consultancy UkrAgroConsult said on Tuesday,
however, that frosts might damage part of winter barley and
winter rapeseed crops as well as poor crops of winter wheat.
 ""Cold snaps could have damaged poor crops of winter grains
and winter rapeseed, therefore farmers should keep in reserve
some seed for possible partial reseeding of winter crops,"" the

18.
 ""Winter grain conditions are much better than last year.
Snow is protecting crops from frost. Crops are in one of the
best conditions seen in the past years,"" UkrAgroConsult said.
 The consultancy also said good crop conditions allowed the
country to expect a jump in grain harvests to 46.2 million
tonnes in 2011 from 39.2 million in 2010.
 UkrAgroConsult forecast that Ukrainian wheat harvest could
rise to 21 million tonnes from 16.9 million in 2010.

 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Higher oil prices, driven by
mounting tensions in the Middle East and North Africa, sent
shares in European airlines lower on Tuesday.
 Air France-KLM shed 3.5 percent, Lufthansa lost 2.1 percent
and International Consolidated Airlines Group -- formed from the
merger of British Airways and Iberia -- dropped 3.3 percent.
 Scandinavian airline SAS fell 2.6 percent, while the STOXX

 ""This could seriously hit their results.""
 Shares in Asian airlines also suffered on concerns over
rising fuel costs.
 Brent crude futures rose more than $1 to above $107 a barrel

 On Tuesday, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi vowed defiance in

fleeting television appearance to disdain protesters and deny he
had fled the country.
 Credit Suisse lowered its earnings estimates for the three
major European carriers, though it remained positive on the
sector.
 The broker cut its earnings estimates for Air France-KLM,
which issued a profit warning two weeks ago, by 81 percent to
94.6 million euros. It also trimmed its forecasts on IAG by 22
percent to 329 million euros and Lufthansa by 3.2 percent to
877.7 million.
 ""While there may prove a lag between higher fuel prices and
higher fare levels, we remain positive on pricing prospects for
the rest of the year, and continue to rate each flag carrier
outperform, with IAG our top pick,"" Credit Suisse said in a
note.

 ZURICH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Swiss exports rose strongly in
January despite the strength of the Swiss franc as demand for
the Alpine country's machines and watches remained strong.
 The impact from the franc, which hit record highs against
euro and dollar at the end of last year, was still limited with
exports rising 15.5 percent in real terms and 5 percent in
nominal terms to 15.2 billion francs ($16.05 billion).
 ""Figures are still quite good overall, especially when you
look at exports in real terms. Exports in nominal terms do not
look quite as good anymore, there has obviously been a price
effect from currencies,"" UBS economist Reto Huenerwadel said.
 ""We see the currency effect mostly in the pharmaceutical
industry but not so much in machines which is positive. Some
branches, like watches, still see higher prices,"" he said.

 While exports in the country's important watches, metal and
machinery sectors were still up by about 17 percent in nominal
terms, chemicals and pharmaceutical exports, which accounted for
more than a third of exports in January, fell 5 percent.
 ""There are some special effects from the pharma sector where
there were some price declines,"" ZKB analyst David Marmet said.
 The pharmaceuticals industry, with Swiss heavyweights Roche
 and Novartis , is facing price pressures due to
competition from generics, the U.S. healthcare reform and
European austerity measures.

 GOOD MOOD
 Switzerland has emerged less scathed from the global
recession than most other European countries and its solid
fundamentals have added to its currency's safe haven appeal.
 The Swiss National Bank expects economic growth to slow to
around 1.5 percent this year from some 2.5 percent in 2010
because of the franc.
 However, SNB policy makers have sounded more sanguine over
the franc's impact recently and SNB chairman Philipp Hildebrand
said that the economy made a good start this year.

 * Wall Street set to join global share sell off
 * U.S. Treasuries get safe-haven flows
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - World stocks fell sharply on
Tuesday as revolt in Libya drove oil prices to 2-1/2 year highs,
prompting fears of disruption to global economic growth.
 Widespread risk aversion boosted the Swiss franc
and prompted strong flows into U.S. Treasury bonds. U.S. stock
index futures also tumbled, suggesting significant losses on
Wall Street when it opens.
 U.S. crude futures hit a 2-1/2 year high and were later up
nearly 8 percent at more than $93 a barrel on the latest
contract's last day of trading, as deadly clashes wracked
exporter Libya's biggest cities.
 Brent oil was up more than 1 percent a barrel at nearly
$107, somewhat shy of Monday's intra-day 2-1/2 year peak.
 Libya is by no means the world's largest oil producer,
ranking third in Africa after Nigeria and Angola, but investors
are concerned about the spread of trouble and a serious
disruption to supply.
 ""Investors are scaling down on exposure across the board,""
said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm. ""Libya is the first major oil exporting country to be
affected ... if this spreads to other oil exporting countries,
it will not be a good sign.""
 Adding to the uncertain mood, two Iranian ships entered the
Suez Canal on Tuesday on their way to the Mediterranean, a move
that is bound to anger Israel.
 Investors are primarily concerned that Middle East/North
Africa trouble will keep oil prices high, driving up inflation,
cutting into corporate profits and crimping economic growth.
 This could be seen most clearly on Tuesday in MSCI's
benchmark emerging market stock index, which was down 1.6
percent. Leading emerging market economies are among the fastest
growing in the world and the most susceptible to inflationary
pressure.
 Globally, world stocks as measured by MSCI were down around
three-quarters of a percent. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 was down
1 percent. Japan's Nikkei earlier lost 1.8 percent.

 FLIGHT TO SAFETY
 The risk-averse mood triggered a broad flight to safety. The
yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 7 basis points to 3.509
percent. Yields on core euro zone debt lost 3 basis points to
3.160 percent.
 ""The situation in the Middle East is overshadowing
everything else, and we've broken a series of technical levels
on the way up,"" a trader said.
 On foreign exchange markets, the dollar initially rallied
broadly, but was later only slightly up on a basket of major
currencies. 
 This was mainly due to a recovery by the euro, which was
flat on the day a $1.3671 after hawkish talk from a European
Central Bank member.
 The euro fell against the Swiss franc, pushing the
traditional safe-haven currency to its strongest in three weeks.
 Separately, the New Zealand dollar hit a near two-month low
against its U.S. counterpart after investors fretted about the
economic damage caused by a strong earthquake which rocked the
country's second biggest city, spurring speculation about the
chance of an interest rate cut.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday while
the dollar rallied broadly after escalating political tension in
Libya prompted selling in higher-yielding assets for the safety
of the U.S. currency and also the Swiss franc.
 The New Zealand dollar hit a near two-month low against its
U.S. counterpart, after investors fretted about the economic
damage caused by an earthquake which rocked the country's second
biggest city, spurring speculation about the chance of an
interest rate cut.
 Risk aversion gripped the currency market after the defiance
of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the face of a mounting
public revolt cranked up political uncertainty and prompted a
cut in supplies from one of the world's major oil exporters.
 ""Investors are scaling down on exposure across the board,""
said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm, adding that speculators were unwinding long positions
in currencies including the euro built up from the start of
2011.
 ""Libya is the first major oil-exporting country to be
affected ... if this spreads to other oil-exporting countries,
it will not be a good sign.""
 Turmoil in Libya has triggered a surge in oil prices this
week, with Brent crude prices jumping 2 percent on the day
around $108 per barrel, hovering near a 2 1/2-year high hit on
Monday, while U.S. crude prices surged 9 percent.
 Higher oil prices are seen weighing on global growth,
particularly in emerging countries which are heavily dependent
on oil and commodity imports. In addition, rising oil prices
have already led to higher inflation, which is also seen as a
threat to vulnerable economies.
 Investors dumped riskier assets including stocks, pushing
the benchmark European share index down nearly 1 percent.
 In early European trade, the euro fell 1 percent on the day
to $1.3527, according to Reuters data.
 Boosted by its broad gains, the dollar rose 0.7 percent to
78.235 against a currency basket.
 The dollar's high liquidity attracted risk-averse investors
despite issues which have been plaguing the currency, including
speculation that U.S. interest rates will stay low, and concerns
about the country's growing deficits.
 The single currency also fell 1 percent on the day to 1.2793
Swiss francs, pushing the traditional safe-haven currency to its
strongest since late January. The dollar was little changed at
0.9458 Swiss francs.
 Risk aversion also boosted the yen, which often benefits in
times of geopolitical concerns, while the Japanese currency took
in its stride a downgrade to its sovereign ratings outlook by
ratings agency Moody's.
 The euro fell 1 percent to 112.48 yen, which brushed off
concerns that higher oil prices could have a deep impact on the
Japanese economy, which is heavily reliant on oil imports. The
dollar slipped 0.3 percent 82.85 yen.
 
 KIWI SUFFERS
 The New Zealand dollar tumbled more than 2 percent on the
day to $0.7469, its weakest since late December, while the
Australian dollar fell as low as $0.9985, falling in sympathy
with the New Zealand currency.
 Market participants said the New Zealand currency extended
losses after Westpac Bank said the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
may cut the official cash rate to shore up confidence, adding
that such a rate cut may occur at or before a policy meeting on
March 10.
 ""The renewed earthquake might mean that the central bank
will wait before it tightens monetary policy -- at least until
it is possible to assess the effects of the latest natural
disaster,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a note.
 ""Fears of this approach are putting pressure on the kiwi
dollar.""

 * 2011 expected to be difficult
 
 PORT LOUIS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mauritius-based luxury hotel
group Sun Resorts pretax profit sank 44.3 percent in 2010, hit
by the euro zone crisis and heavy discounting, the firm said on
Tuesday.
 Sun Resorts posted a 226.9 million Mauritius rupee ($7.70
million) pretax profit last year after the global economic
downturn hit the island's tourist industry and hurt growth in
one of Africa's traditionally most stable and prosperous
economies.
 Earnings per share fell 36 percent to 2.45 rupees.
 The group's shares were stable at 60 rupees each.
 ""The year has been impacted by the euro zone crisis and the
ongoing challenging economic conditions in our main source
markets,"" the company said in a statement.
 ""As the industry was still faced with an oversupply of
rooms, heavy discounting has prevailed throughout the year.""
 The company said a strong rupee exchange rate against the
European currencies further impacted average daily rates.
 Room occupancy was at 68.4 percent during last year.
 Sun Resorts declared a final dividend of 0.65 rupees
compared to 0.60 rupees in 2009, which will bring the total
dividend to 1.15 rupees against 1.10 rupees in 2009.
 This year would be very challenging because the economic
climate in the major source markets, mainly Europe, was expected
to be difficult.
 ""With an expected increase in the number of rooms in the
industry this year, we expect competition to intensify and rates
will continue to be under pressure,"" the group said.
 Tourism typically generates about 10 percent of the nation's
gross domestic product and European tourists account for some
two-thirds of arrivals.
 Sun Resorts said the more modern Long Beach, which will
replace former Coco Beach, is scheduled to open in April.

 * Confident Merkel will back stronger EFSF despite home woes
 * Implementation of reforms key to bring down bond spreads
 
 By Fiona Ortiz and Paul Taylor
 MADRID, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Spain is winning the struggle to
restore financial market confidence and is convinced Germany
will back a stronger euro zone rescue fund despite Chancellor
Angela Merkel's domestic troubles, Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero said.
 ""We are winning the battle, but I still have my guard up
because we have to implement all the reforms that have generated
more confidence,"" Zapatero told Reuters Insider in an interview.
 He voiced confidence that Merkel would back a strengthening
of the European Financial Stability Facility at a March 11 euro
zone summit despite political problems sharpened by her party's
crushing loss in a state election in Hamburg on Sunday.
 ""I am confident, confident in the capacity and commitment of
Chancellor Merkel. We know this a very intense electoral year in
Germany, but I am confident,"" he said.
 The single currency area's fourth biggest economy came under
attack in bond markets after a real estate bubble burst, causing
a recession and 20 percent unemployment, straining public
finances and threatening its fragile savings banks.
 Until recently, the fate of the euro appeared to hinge on
whether Spain could avoid following Greece and Ireland into a
bailout that would stretch Europe's rescue fund to the limits.
 ""I have to admit that less than a year ago there were huge
doubts. I felt it directly,"" Zapatero said.
 Critics said the soft-spoken premier, best known until then
for legalising gay marriage and abortion, was in denial. He
blamed the crisis on speculators bent on destroying the euro
rather than addressing Spain's own structural problems.
 But since May, his minority Socialist government has cut
spending, imposed unpopular public sector pay cuts, reformed
labour law, clinched union backing to raise the retirement age
to 67, and forced savings banks to merge and raise new funds.
 
 HUGE LESSONS
 ""I feel like I have been in battle since the last quarter of
2008,"" he said in an hour-long session in his Moncloa office. ""I
have learned huge lessons because none of the classic manuals of
the art of war are any use.""
 Pressure mounted on Spain after European partners and the
International Monetary Fund rescued Greece from the brink of
bankruptcy in May. A second wave of selling erupted when Ireland
was forced to seek an international bailout in December.
 Comparing his task to running a marathon, he said: ""You
think you are there and then, suddenly, Ireland happens.""
 Zapatero responded to the Irish collapse by accelerating
reforms. He announced the sale of stakes in the state lottery
and airport operator, and coaxed trade unions and employers into
signing a landmark social pact on pension reform and employment
incentives.
 ""Spain's reform agenda is truly impressive in any
international or historical context; something the market still
doesn't seem to fully appreciate,"" Goldman Sachs chief European
economist Erik Nielsen wrote this week.
 Zapatero is now working to make collective bargaining rules
more flexible by mid-March, organising negotiations by company
rather than sector and linking pay to productivity, not just
inflation.
 His approval rating has sunk and his party trails the
conservative opposition Popular Party by more than 10 points in
opinion polls, prompting some analysts to say he is on a suicide
mission that will end in certain defeat in 2012.
 But Zapatero said any prime minister would have done the
same to save his country. The 50-year-old lawyer, in office
since 2004, declined to say whether he would seek a third term
next year or step aside for a more popular Socialist candidate.
 The prime minister said Madrid was willing to give binding
legal force to long-term deficit reduction policies but Spain's
rigid constitution made it impractical to pass a German-style
""debt brake"" amendment as Merkel has sought.
 He said he would take further steps to ensure that Spain's
autonomous regions stuck to their spending limits.
 ""We are part of the culture of maximum budget stability. The
two big political parties have a consensus on that,"" he said,
endorsing Franco-German ""competitiveness pact"" proposals for
greater economic policy coordination in the euro zone.
 Spain will have achieved its goal of cutting the deficit to
9.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 when final figures
are published in the next two weeks, Zapatero said, and it would
meet its commitment to slash it to 6 percent this year.
 ""We do not expect tensions on Spanish debt. We must reduce
the spread over German bonds to improve our financing costs, but
the reforms of the financial system and the savings banks will
contribute to reducing our risk premium,"" he said.
 Spain's cost of borrowing soared in November and December in
the run-up to the Irish rescue. Madrid had to pay 3 percentage
points more on bonds than Germany, but that has fallen to 2
percentage points, still far above the 0.7 percentage point
spread before the crisis began.
 Asked if he thought Merkel's domestic problems would make it
harder for her to agree to a stronger euro zone safety net next
month, he said: ""Naturally the chancellor has domestic problems
-- we all do -- but when it comes to the decisive moment, she
always puts her responsibilty to Europe first.""

 By Hideyuki Sano and Masayuki Kitano	
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly
and the New Zealand dollar tumbled on Tuesday as mounting
tension in the Middle East and a deadly earthquake in New
Zealand drove investors to cut risk.	
 Investors were spooked by the unrest in Libya, where forces
loyal to leader Muammar Gaddafi have fought an increasingly
bloody battle to keep the veteran leader in power.

 The rising tensions have sparked a surge in oil prices,
weighed on Asian shares and currencies and triggered
profit-taking in currencies that have rallied recently such as
the sterling and the euro, market players said.	
 Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore, said
the drop in emerging Asian currencies on Tuesday was likely
prompted by a knee-jerk move to cut back on risk-taking.	
 But there could be a more enduring impact on major
currencies such as sterling and the euro if the rise in oil
prices persists, he said.	
 ""The idea of higher oil prices, particularly in Europe, is
not going to be positive. The UK and Europe are going to suffer
... They are already in trouble with inflation with very low
growth,"" Ryan said.	
 ""If they have to raise interest rates not because of
economic growth but because of inflation fears that is hardly
positive,"" he said, adding that sterling in particular could be
vulnerable.	
 The dollar climbed 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 78.089 , and now faces resistance right
below 78.200, where the conversion line and base line come in on
daily Ichimoku charts.	
 Short-covering likely helped to amplify the dollar's gains,
said a trader for a major Japanese bank in Singapore.	
 ""Dollar selling had accelerated last week in line with a
drop in U.S. yields... I think the market was probably tilted
toward short dollar positions and that some dollar
short-covering is taking place now,"" he said.	
 Middle East tensions were likely to remain in the spotlight
following news that two Iranian ships entered the Suez Canal on
Tuesday and were heading toward the Mediterranean, a move
certain to anger Israel. 
 But it is far from clear that the short-covering in the
dollar will persist, said the trader for a major Japanese bank,
adding that moves in U.S. bond yields would be key to the
dollar's near-term fortunes.	
 ""What may happen is that U.S. Treasuries could attract
flight-to-safety buying and U.S. bond yields may fall and put
some pressure on the dollar,"" he said.	
 U.S. financial markets will resume trade on Tuesday after
having been shut on Monday for a national holiday.	
 
 KIWI SLIDES AFTER EARTHQUAKE 
 One of the sharpest moves was in the New Zealand dollar,
which slid 1.8 percent to $0.7498 after a strong quake
hit New Zealand's second-biggest city of Christchurch, and
stirred talk the country's central bank may soon lower interest
rates.	
 Westpac Bank said the Reserve Bank of New Zealand may cut
the official cash rate to shore up confidence, adding that such
a rate cut may occur at or before a policy meeting on March 10.

 The kiwi has initial support at the lower Bollinger Band
that now lies at $0.7493. Below that its 200-day moving average
offers support at $0.7355.	
 Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.6168 , while the
euro slid 0.7 percent to $1.3588 and fell 0.4 percent
against the yen to 113.25 yen .	
 The single currency has lacked the vigour to break above key
resistance after Germany's main ruling party suffered a crushing
defeat at a regional election in the city-state of Hamburg on
Sunday.	
 One trader said there could be further selling of the euro
if the single currency were to drop below 112.50 yen.	
 The dollar gained ground against the yen as its broad rally
gathered steam, and rose 0.2 percent to 82.34 yen .	
 The yen and Japanese government bonds took in their stride
news that Moody's Investors Service had cut its outlook on
Japan's Aa2 sovereign rating to negative from stable, with
10-year JGB futures holding on to their gains and the yen higher
on crosses despite Moody's decision. 
 Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute,
warned that the outlook change could be negative for the yen and
JGBs down the road.	
 ""The markets may take a body blow from the downgrade in the
mid-term if not short-term,"" Haji said.	
 ""If there is uncertainty over the passage of next fiscal
year's budget and related bills, there may be some repercussions
such as domestic investors' reluctance to buy Japanese
government bonds by the end of the fiscal year,"" Haji said.

 * Yuan deposits in Hong Kong at 315 billion yuan at end-2010
 By James Pomfret and Farah Master
 HONG KONG, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The pace of the yuan's
convertibility may accelerate as global demand grows for trade
settlement in the Chinese currency, a Chinese central bank
official said.
 ""If you look at the history and the progress of international
use of our renminbi (yuan), you find that sometimes demand grows
very quickly,"" said Xing Yujing, deputy director general of the
monetary policy department of the People's Bank of China.
 ""If there's demand from the market in order to facilitate
trade and investment, the change may be quicker than we imagined
before,"" Xing told an economic conference held by Goldman Sachs
in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
 China is seeking to promote the use of the yuan overseas as
part of a longer-term plan to make it an international reserve
currency along with the U.S. dollar, analysts say.
 Beijing's promotion of Hong Kong as an offshore yuan trading
hub has resulted in a flurry of yuan-denominated corporate bonds
also known as dim-sum bonds, banks creating new structured
products, and more Chinese importers settling trade in renminbi.
 Speaking at the same event, Hong Kong Monetary Authority
Deputy Chief Executive Peter Pang said the growth potential for
foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into China from yuan bond
issuance in Hong Kong was huge and could double from last year.
 ""Hong Kong's investment of $46 billion in 2009 accounted for
nearly 50 percent of total mainland FDI. FDI in the mainland
financed by renminbi bonds issued in Hong Kong was less than 2
billion yuan ($304.3 million) last year, or 1.5 percent of total
mainland FDI, so the potential for growth is really huge,"" he
said.
 It would ""almost double"" the total issue amount of 46 billion
yuan last year, he told the economic conference.
 Yuan deposits in Hong Kong reached 315 billion yuan at the
end of December last year, dwarfing the roughly 80 billion yuan
of outstanding ""dim sum bonds"", a trend that is expected to
continue to underscore the supply-demand mismatch.
 Yuan shares listed in Hong Kong may be just around the corner
with Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd's <0001.HK> yuan REIT expected

interest in it, the official quoted Teixeira as saying.
 The minister said the Portuguese economy was doing relatively
well, according to the official, who attended the meeting.

 By Hideyuki Sano and Masayuki Kitano	
 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly
and the New Zealand dollar tumbled on Tuesday as mounting
tension in the Middle East and a deadly earthquake in New
Zealand drove investors to cut risk.	
 Investors were spooked by the unrest in Libya, where forces
loyal to leader Muammar Gaddafi have fought an increasingly
bloody battle to keep the veteran leader in power.	
 The rising tensions have sparked a surge in oil prices,
weighed on Asian shares and currencies and triggered
profit-taking in currencies that have rallied recently such as
the sterling and the euro, market players said.	
 Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore, said
the drop in emerging Asian currencies on Tuesday was likely
prompted by a knee-jerk move to cut back on risk-taking.	
 But there could be a more enduring impact on major
currencies such as sterling and the euro if the rise in oil
prices persists, he said.	
 ""The idea of higher oil prices, particularly in Europe, is
not going to be positive. The UK and Europe are going to suffer
... They are already in trouble with inflation with very low
growth,"" Ryan said.	
 ""If they have to raise interest rates not because of
economic growth but because of inflation fears that is hardly
positive,"" he said, adding that sterling in particular could be
vulnerable.	
 The dollar climbed 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 78.107 , and now faces a resistance right
below 78.200, where the conversion line and base line come in on
daily Ichimoku charts.	
 One of the sharpest moves was in the New Zealand dollar,
which slid 1.5 percent to $0.7523 after a strong quake
hit New Zealand's second-biggest city of Christchurch.
 
 Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.6160 , while the
euro slid 0.7 percent to $1.3584 and fell 0.4 percent
against the yen to 113.17 yen .	
 
 LACKING VIGOUR	
 The single currency has lacked the vigour to break above key
resistance after Germany's main ruling party suffered a crushing
defeat at a regional election in the city-state of Hamburg on
Sunday.	
 One trader said there could be further selling of the euro
if the single currency were to drop below 112.50 yen.	
 The dollar also gained ground against the yen as its broad
rally gathered steam, and rose 0.2 percent to 82.29 yen .	
 The yen and Japanese government bonds took in their stride
news that Moody's Investors Service had cut its outlook on
Japan's Aa2 sovereign rating to negative from stable, with
10-year JGB futures holding on to their gains and the yen higher
on crosses despite Moody's decision. 
 Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute,
warned that the outlook change could be negative for the yen and
JGBs down the road.	
 ""The markets may take a body blow from the downgrade in the
mid-term if not short-term,"" Haji said.	
 ""If there is uncertainty over the passage of next fiscal
year's budget and related bills, there may be some repercussions
such as domestic investors' reluctance to buy Japanese
government bonds by the end of the fiscal year,"" Haji said.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Mari Terawaki
 TOKYO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investor sentiment
on domestic stocks fell for the first time in five months in
February as caution grew that a rally in Tokyo shares which
started late last year could run out of steam, a Reuters survey
showed.
 The key Nikkei average reached a 9-½ month high last week
but concerns over inflation in emerging markets and wariness
over Europe's debt problems have made retail investors slightly
pessimistic about the outlook for Japanese shares.
 The Reuters sentiment index, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of investors who say they are bearish from those who
are bullish, fell 12 points to minus 4 in February.
 The index logged its first monthly fall in five months,
having surged a total of 78 points until the previous month from
an 18-month low of minus 70 in September.
 ""The short-term outlook is still strong, but in the long run,
uncertainty about the situation in Europe remains,"" said an
investor in his 40s.
 ""Some say that inflation would be positive for stocks, but
there are concerns about how growing inflation in emerging
markets could trigger uncertainty,"" he said.
 The Reuters survey of 510 Japanese individual investors was
conducted on Feb 7-10 when the key Nikkei average touched a
nine-month peak. The Nikkei was also up about 1.5 percent from
the pervious survey about a month ago.
 Despite the fall in the index in February, there were many
positive comments about the outlook backed by evidence of strong
Japanese corporate earnings and an improved outlook for the U.S.
economy, underscoring the uptrend in the stock market.
 Japanese shares performed well against key markets since the
start of February until Monday, with the Topix index the best
performer among 30 global markets, gaining 6.6 percent, and the
Nikkei average the third best performer, rising 5.6 percent,
Thomson Reuters data showed.
 The yen was little changed from the the previous survey in
January at around 83 against the dollar.
 ""We've seen unrest in Egypt and other places. But in general,
there is limited risk in Japan, which should draw safe-haven
money into Japanese stocks,"" said an office worker in his 30s.
 Unrest in Libya spread to the capital Tripoli on Sunday after
scores of protesters were killed in the second city Benghazi.

 By Gyles Beckford	
 WELLINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A strong earthquake killed at
least 65 people in New Zealand's second-biggest city of
Christchurch on Tuesday, with more casualties expected as
rescuers worked into the night to find scores of people trapped
inside collapsed buildings.	
 It was the second quake to hit the city of almost 400,000
people in five months, and New Zealand's most deadly natural
disaster for 80 years.	
 ""We may well be witnessing New Zealand's darkest day...The
death toll I have at the moment is 65 and that may rise,"" said
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who had flown to his home
town of Christchurch, where he still has family.	
 The 6.3 magnitude quake struck at lunchtime, when streets
and shops thronged with people and offices were still occupied.	
 Rescuers, working under lights in rain, focused on two
collapsed buildings: a financial-services office block whose
four stories pancaked on top of each other, and a TV building
which also housed an English-language school.	
 Twelve Japanese students at the school were believed to be
missing, an official in Japan told Reuters.	
 Trapped survivors could be heard shouting out to rescuers
from the TV building. Local media say as many as a dozen or more
people could still be inside. Relatives of those feared trapped
kept a vigil outside the building as rain began to fall.	
 A woman freed from a collapsed building said she had waited
for six hours for rescuers to reach her after the quake, which
was followed by at least 20 aftershocks. 
 ""I thought the best place was under the desk but the ceiling
collapsed on top, I can't move and I'm just terrified,"" office
worker Anne Voss told TV3 news by mobile phone.	
 
 Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker described the city, a historic
tourist town popular with overseas students, as a war zone. He
told local radio that up to 200 could be trapped in buildings
but later revised that estimate down to around 100 or so.	
 ""It is a tragedy that is unbelievable,"" he said.	
 It was the country's worst natural disaster since a 1931
quake in the North Island city of Napier which killed 256.
Christchurch Hospital saw an influx of injured residents.	
 ""They are largely crushes and cuts types of injuries and
chest pain as well,"" said David Meates, head of the Canterbury
Health Board. Some of the more seriously injured could be
evacuated to other cities, he added.	
 
 TRAPPED 
 All army medical staff have been mobilised, while several
hundred troops were helping with the rescue, officials said.	
 Christchurch has been described as a little piece of
England.	
 It has an iconic cathedral, now largely destroyed, and a
river called the Avon. It had many historic stone buildings, and
is popular with English-language students and also with tourists
as a springboard for tours of the scenic South Island.	
 Emergency shelters had also been set up in local schools and
at a race course as night approached. Helicopters dumped water
to try to douse a fire in one tall office building, while a
crane was used to help workers trapped in another office block.	
 ""I was in the square right outside the cathedral -- the
whole front has fallen down and there were people running from
there. There were people inside as well,"" said John Gurr, a
camera technician who was in the city centre when the quake hit.	
 ""A lady grabbed hold of me to stop falling over...We just
got blown apart. Colombo Street, the main street, is just a
mess...There's lots of water everywhere, pouring out of the
ground,"" he said.	
 
 STREETS TURN INTO QUICKSAND	
 Christchurch is built on silt, sand and gravel, with a water
table beneath. In an earthquake, the water rises, mixing with
the sand and turning the ground into a swamp, swallowing up
roads and cars.	
 TV footage showed sections of road that had collapsed into a
milky, sand-coloured lake beneath the surface. One witness
described the footpaths as like ""walking on sand"".	
 Unlike last year's even stronger tremor, which struck early
in the morning when streets were virtually empty, people were
walking or driving along streets when the shallow tremor struck,
sending awnings and the entire faces of buildings crashing down.	
 Police said debris had rained down on two buses, crushing
them, but there was no word on any casualties.	
 The quake hit at 12:51 pm (2351 GMT Monday) at a depth of
only 4 km (2.5 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

 QUAKE COULD DAMAGE ALREADY FRAIL ECONOMY	
 Fears that the quake could dent confidence in the country's
already fragile economy knocked the New Zealand dollar down by
about 1.8 percent from late U.S. levels to $0.75 .	
 Westpac Bank raised the possibility that the central bank
could cut interest rates over the next few weeks in a bid to
shore up the economy, while other banks pushed out their
expectations for the timing of the next rate increase.	
 ANZ now expects the central bank to keep rates on hold until
the first quarter of 2012.	
 Shares in Australian banks and insurers, which typically
have large operations in New Zealand, fell after the quake.	
 The tremor was centred about 10 km (six miles) southwest of
Christchurch, which had suffered widespread damage during last
September's 7.1 magnitude quake but no deaths.	
 New Zealand sits between the Pacific and Indo-Australian
tectonic plates and records on average more than 14,000
earthquakes a year, of which about 20 would normally top
magnitude 5.0.

 By Nick Macfie	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped and Asia
stock prices fell on Tuesday as investors took fright at the
unfolding crisis in Libya and turned to safe havens such as
government bonds and gold, pushing the precious metal briefly to
a seven-week high.	
 U.S. crude futures hit a 2-1/2 year high on concern
that violence in Libya could cut more of the OPEC-member's
output and that a similar story could play out in other top oil
producers in North Africa and the Middle East. 
Brent crude for April delivery rose $1.42 cents to
$107.16 a barrel by 0451 GMT, after rising as high as $108.18 in
early trade. On Monday, Brent hit a 2-1/2 year high of $108.70. 
 ""The market is very nervous over news of violence in Libya,""
said Yinxi Yu, a commodities analyst with Barclays Capital.	
 Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.8 percent and
the MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was also off about 1.8 percent . 
 Airline stocks tumbled across the region on the
back of rising oil prices. Korean Air Line Co Ltd
led losers, dropping more than 9 percent. Hong Kong's Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd fell more than 4 percent to a
six-month low.	
 Major South Korean builders also slid as they put their
Libya construction projects on hold. Hyundai E&C shares tumbled
more than 9 percent, while Daewoo Engineering & Construction
fell 6.3 percent.	
 Moody's Investors Service changed the outlook on Japan's Aa2
sovereign rating to negative from stable, warning that
government policies may not be enough to rein in public debt.	
 ""The market is not reacting much to the decision,"" said
Takeshi Shibasaki, chief financial analyst at Mizuho Securities.
""Standard and Poor's has already cut Japan's rating, and
separately there already were expectations among participants
that Moody's would do something.""	
 Gold, a traditional refuge in times of tumult, extended
gains and rose to its highest in seven weeks, lifting silver to
its strongest level since 1980. 
 Spot gold rose $3.75 to $1,409.70 an ounce, but soon
drifted back into negative territory. Silver jumped above
$34 an ounce, its highest since 1980, before also falling back
to around $33.33.	
 
 MOUNTING REVOLT	
 European stocks lost more than 1 percent on Monday on a
combination of fears over Libya, where Muammar Gaddafi faced a
mounting revolt against his 41-year rule, signs of imminent
interest rate rises and more evidence of a poor earnings season.	
 U.S. markets were closed Monday for a holiday but U.S. stock
futures were sharply lower, suggesting Wall Street will
likely fall when they reopen on Tuesday.	
 ""There are a lot of people in the marketplace waiting to get
in at better levels,"" said Todd Martin, Asia equity strategist
with Societe Generale in Hong Kong.	
 ""Could we be in for a mid-cycle correction? Absolutely, but
from what we are seeing -- loose monetary policy and
improvements in Europe -- I don't see outrageously overconfident
market participants yet. We are in the middle of a bull market.
We are getting a proper correction here but long-only money will
be buying into this,"" he said.
    In Asia, Martin recommended clients shifting more into
equity markets in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, all of which he said
were attractively valued.	
The dollar climbed 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 78.107 on the Libya violence. 
 One of the sharpest moves was in the New Zealand dollar,
which slid 1.5 percent to $0.7523 after a strong quake
hit New Zealand's second-biggest city of Christchurch.
 
 Libyan forces loyal to Gaddafi, the world's
second-longest-serving leader after the Sultan of Brunei, have
fought an increasingly bloody battle to keep him in power with
residents reporting gunfire in parts of the capital Tripoli and
one political activist saying warplanes had bombed the city. 
Security forces had killed dozens of protesters across the
country, human rights groups and witnesses said, prompting
widespread condemnation from world leaders.	
 U.S. Treasuries jumped in Asia, with the yield on the
10-year benchmark falling 7 basis points to 3.515 percent, and
Japanese government bonds also rose, with 10-year futures
up more than half a point. 
 The Christchurch quake killed at least 65 people, the
country's prime minister said. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50
index was down 0.67 percent.

 By Gyles Beckford	
 WELLINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A strong quake hit New
Zealand's second-biggest city of Christchurch on Tuesday for the
second time in five months, toppling buildings, causing
""multiple fatalities"", trapping people beneath rubble and
sparking fires.	
 Local TV showed bodies being pulled out of rubble strewn
around the city centre, though it was unclear whether any of
them were alive, but police reported multiple fatalities after
the 6.3 magnitude quake struck during the busy lunchtime.	
 ""I was in the square right outside the cathedral - the whole
front has fallen down and there were people running from there -
there were people inside as well,"" said John Gurr, a camera
technician who was in the centre of the city when the quake hit.	
 ""A lady grabbed hold of me to stop falling over ... It's not
nice at all. We just got blown apart. Colombo Street, the main
street, is just a mess ... There's lots of water everywhere,
pouring out of the ground - its liquefaction - its an absolute
mess.""	
 
 SILT, SAND AND GRAVEL	
 Christchurch is built on silt, sand and gravel, with a water
table under it. In an earthquake, the water rises, mixing with
sand.	
 Unlike last year's even stronger tremor, which struck early
in the morning when streets were virtually empty, the streets,
shops and offices in the city of almost 400,000 were thronged
with people when the shallow tremor struck.	
 It hit at 12:51 pm (2351 GMT Monday) at a depth of only 4 km
(2.5 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey's Web site.	
 ""It's huge, it's just huge,"" a priest told a TV reporter
outside the remains of the city's stone cathedral, part of which
had been reduced to a pile of large sandstone blocks.	
 ""I just don't know whether there are people under this
rubble,"" he said, before he appeared to add in a quiet voice: ""I
think so.""	
 Prime Minister John Key, who called an emergency cabinet
meeting for later in the day, told parliament: ""This is a very
populated time with people at work and children at school.
Sadly, I cannot rule out whether there have been fatalities or
not. But we are aware of significant damage to buildings that
had people in them at the time."" 
 News of the quake helped send the New Zealand dollar to as
low as $0.7541 , down about 1.2 percent from late U.S.
levels on fears the damage could dent confidence in the already
fragile economy.	
 The tremor was centred about 10 km (six miles) southwest of
Christchurch, which had suffered widespread damage during last
September's 7.1 magnitude quake but no deaths.	
 ""There has been a lot of damage, our TVs have been smashed
and there are big cracks in the house. Neighbours have lost
brick fences,"" Nicholas Hextall, who lives in central
Christchurch, said by phone. Power and water had been cut.	
 The region has been struck by thousands of aftershocks since
the original quake.	
 New Zealand, which sits between the Pacific and
Indo-Australian tectonic plates, records on average more than

 LONDON , Feb 21 (Reuters) - European Central Bank
policymaker Axel Weber on Monday opposed key proposals by euro-
zone members aimed at drawing a line under the sovereign debt
crisis, saying current measures go far enough and big
adjustments are not needed.
 Weber, who earlier this month said he was stepping down
from the Bundesbank and ruled himself out of the running to
become the next ECB president, said financial assistance to
struggling member states should help buy them time until they
initiate economic reforms themselves.
 ""Against this backdrop, the existing instruments for
short-term crisis resolution are adequate and, despite repeated
demands to the contrary, should not undergo significant
adjustment,"" Weber wrote in a guest column for the Financial
Times, published on its website.
 The European Commission and the ECB called last month for
boosting the effective capacity of the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) as well as expanding its scope of
operations.
 But Weber said these proposals could weaken the
responsibility of member states and shift risks to the
taxpayers.
 Cutting interest rates on future euro-zone rescue loans
would also introduce joint euro-zone government bonds, known as
E-bonds, ""more or less through the back door,"" he said.
 Euro-zone countries are also giving serious consideration
to letting the EFSF buy distressed governments' bonds in the
primary market.
 Weber also rejected this idea, saying it would be
insufficient and would not necessarily stabilize bond prices.
 ""I fear that the proposals currently on the table fall
short of what is required and run the risk of being weakened
further in the political process,"" Weber wrote.

 * Fitch says resolving Icesave key for Iceland outlook

 * Poll shows support for bill
 * Icelanders fear issue may wind up in an EU court
(Adds quotes, background)
 By Omar Valdimarsson and Mia Shanley
 REYKJAVIK,/STOCKHOLM, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The Icelandic
government's hopes to win a referendum on repaying $5 billion
to Britain and the Netherlands got a boost from an opinion
poll on Monday, while ratings agency Fitch warned of renewed
economic uncertainty.
 The long-running saga took a new twist on Sunday when the
president for the second time rejected a law on repaying the
debts, thus forcing a referendum on the proposal, which has
already won parliament's support.
 Icelanders in March 2010 rejected an earlier bill, but the
government says the new deal has much better terms.
 The debt to the Dutch and British was run up when the two
governments repaid domestic depositors in online accounts
called Icesave accounts, which were run by an Icelandic bank
that collapsed in 2008 along with two other banks on the
island.
 An opinion poll of 771 people by research group MMR showed
57.7 percent in support of the new repayment bill.
 The government is expected to decide on Tuesday when the
referendum will be held though the law stipulates that it must
take place within two months.
 Fitch, which has Iceland on a ""BB+"" non-investment grade
rating with a ""negative"" outlook, said resolving the Icesave
dispute was crucial to getting the country back on a stable
outlook and that the referendum could delay the lifting of
capital controls -- key to restarting the flow of foreign
investment.
 ""Until it is resolved, it does restrict access to
international capital markets,"" Paul Rawkins, Fitch's senior
director for western Europe, told Reuters. ""I think the
Icelanders really hope to regain access to capital markets,
and this casts a shadow over that.""
 Iceland put capital controls in place to stem an outflow
of funds from the country when all of its top banks buckled
under a weight of debt during the 2008 crisis.
 This is the second time Iceland will vote on Icesave and
follows several months of negotiations between Icelandic,
Dutch and British officials on a new repayment plan.
 Rawkins said he doubted the current deal with Britain and
the Netherlands would be superseded by a better one.
 ICELANDERS UNCERTAIN
 ""Don't even mention Icesave,"" said petrol station worker
Jens Sigurdsson, 55. ""The president should simply have signed
the bill -- we have to pay this whether we like it or not.""
 Lawyer Larus Blondal, the opposition's representative on
the team that negotiated the deal, told daily newspaper
Morgunbladid he was convinced there would be no further
talks.
 ""It seems to me that the issue now is whether people want
a negotiated settlement at all,"" he said.
 There are also concerns that the issue could wind up in a
court in the EFTA trade and cooperation bloc of which Iceland
is a part. This could mean it may have to pay higher interest
rates than outlined in the current deal.
 Many Icelanders believe it is unfair that taxpayers must
foot the bill for mistakes made by private banks.
 Sveinn Gudjonsson, an office manager in downtown
Reykjavik, said he had initially been opposed to repaying the
debt.
 ""But I have now come to the conclusion that we should pay,
and I will be voting in favor of the deal in the referendum,""
he said. ""It's time to put this behind us -- and I don't want
to take the risk of having my future decided by a European
court.""

 REYKJAVIK,/STOCKHOLM Feb 21 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings Agency
said on Monday there was renewed uncertainty about Iceland's
recovery after the country's president triggered a vote on a new
bill to pay back Britain and the Netherlands $5 billion of debt.
 President Olafur Grimsson said on Sunday he would not sign
the bill, which parliament approved last week, a refusal which
forces Iceland to hold a referendum on the new plan. Icelanders
overwhelmingly rejected an earlier bill, but government
negotiators say the new package is on much better terms.

of the new deal, which offers reduced interest payments compared
with an original plan.
 Fitch, which has Iceland on a BB+ non-investment grade
rating with a negative outlook, said resolving the Icesave
dispute was key to getting the country back on a stable outlook
and that the referendum could delay the lifting of capital
controls -- key to restarting the flow of foreign investment.
 ""Until it is resolved, it does restrict access to
international capital markets,"" Paul Rawkins, Fitch's senior
director for western Europe, told Reuters. ""I think the
Icelanders really hope to regain access to capital markets, and
this casts a shadow over that.""
 Iceland put capital controls in place to stem an outflow of
funds from the country when all of its top banks buckled under a
weight of debt during the 2008 crisis.
 Iceland owes Britain and the Netherlands money they used to
bail out domestic savers who lost money in online ""Icesave""
accounts run by one of its failed banks.
 The government is expected to decide on Tuesday when the
referendum will be held though the law stipulates that it must
take place within two months.
 This is the second time Iceland will vote on Icesave and
follows several months of negotiations between Icelandic, Dutch
and British officials on a new repayment plan.
 There is great concern that Iceland will not be able to get
Britain and the Netherlands back to the negotiating table.
 Rawkins said he doubted the current deal with Britain and
the Netherlands would be superseded by a better one.
 ICELANDERS UNCERTAIN
 People in Iceland are split on the issue.
 ""Don't even mention Icesave,"" said petrol station worker
Jens Sigurdsson, 55. ""The president should simply have signed
the bill -- we have to pay this whether we like it or not.""
 Lawyer Larus Blondal, who was the opposition's
representative on the negotiating team, told Morgunbladid he was
convinced there would be no further negotiations.
 ""It seems to me that the issue now is whether people want a
negotiated settlement at all,"" he said.
 There are also concerns that the issue could wind up in a
court in the EFTA trade and cooperation bloc of which Iceland is
a part. This could mean it may have to pay higher interest rates
than outlined in the current deal.
 Islandsbanki said in a note that even if Iceland won a
lawsuit, it would have costs associated with taking the matter
to court while a further delay in resolving the dispute would
exacerbate damage already caused by it.
 ""There is also the possibility that Iceland could lose the
case, which would probably put the country in a weaker
negotiating position than it currently has, and result in a less
beneficial result,"" it said.
 Many Icelanders believe it is unfair that taxpayers must
foot the bill for mistakes made by private banks.
 Sveinn Gudjonsson, an office manager in downtown Reykjavik,
said he had been opposed to paying the IceSave bill from the
beginning.
 ""But I have now come to the conclusion that we should pay
and I will be voting in favor of the deal in the referendum,"" he
said. ""It's time to put this behind us -- and I don't want to
take the risk of having my future decided by a European court.""

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2011 01:28PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Investors may shift Gulf exposure on political unrest," * Gulf to see capital outflows; UAE, Qatar could benefit
 * Libyan turmoil, Iranian naval vessels to add pressure
 
 By Martin Dokoupil
 DUBAI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Revolts in the Arab world may
prompt investors to cut exposure in wealthy Gulf oil producers
in the short term but more stable countries such as the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar may benefit from a shift in capital
flows.
 Massive protests have swept through Arab countries that face
crippling poverty and unemployment, unseating military-backed
leaders in Egypt and Tunisia, threatening Muammar Gaddafi's
four-decade-old grip on power in Libya, and also triggering
protests by members of Bahrain's Shi'ite majority against their
Sunni rulers.
 Weeks of spreading unrest have sent debt protection costs
and yields on government debt up across the Gulf, the world's
top oil exporting region, while stocks and currencies -- most of
them pegged to the U.S. dollar -- have been volatile.
 ""The region as a whole has a degree of capital outflows,""
said Dina Ahmad, CEEMEA strategist at BNP Paribas in London. ""It
is quite difficult to estimate because data are very lagged.""
 At the peak of Egypt's political turmoil, Citi has estimated
capital outflows from the most populous Arab country at $500
million to $1 billion a day.
 However, in the Gulf that benefits from robust crude prices,
even the unrest-hit tiny Bahrain has not seen large outflows
since anti-government protests began a week ago, market players
say, partly due to a lower investor presence.
 ""There is a moderate risk of modest outflows,"" said Gabriel
Sterne, senior economist at London-based Exotix. ""We have seen
yields on the Bahrain bonds rise a bit.""
 The yield on Bahrain's Islamic bond, due in 2014, has shot
up to 3.9 percent, its highest level since last May, while
bankers have said the kingdom's planned $1 billion sovereign
bond issue was likely to be delayed.
 Debt insurance costs for Bahrain, a regional financial hub
and home to some $10 billion in mutual funds, hit fresh 18-month
highs of 300 points on Monday, Markit said.
 Concerns that the political unrest and demonstrations in
Bahrain will persist prompted Standard and Poor's to lower the
country's sovereign credit ratings on Monday.
 
 FLOWS SHIFT
 Even for Qatar, which enjoys one of the world's highest
economic output per capita at nearly $75,000 and saw no
anti-government protests, five-year credit default swaps rose to
a new one-year high of 113 points on Monday.
 ""Although their (investor) concerns will be focused on
states that have seen unrest, I suspect that some will have put
their plans for much of the region on review,"" saidSimon
Williams, chief economist at HSBC Bank in Dubai.
 Gulf Arab stocks have been edgy, heading back towards
January lows, as popular unrest spread to Bahrain and Libya,
while currency forward markets have been on a roller-coaster
ride.
 Traders expected pressure on currencies to increase if
bloody turmoil in Libya continues and with a planned passage of
Iranian naval vessels through Egypt's Suez Canal.
 But high political risks in some parts of the Arab world and
solid oil prices around $90 a barrel, could also make some
investors shift their exposure to more stable Gulf states.
 ""Our view here is that obviously a premium for political
risk has gone up throughout the region. But we do differentiate
quite strongly between places like the UAE, where the political
system is broadly much more stable, and Qatar as well,"" said a
London-based fixed income investor.
 ""If you want to stay in the Middle East, you switch from
Bahrain into the UAE or into Qatar but I am not sure you want to
switch altogether,"" he said.
 Benchmark bond yields have climbed for both Qatar and the
UAE's emirate of Abu Dhabi despite staying insulated from unrest
as their small local populations are pampered by petrodollars. 
 ""We are certainly getting some inquiries about shifting
money outside to other parts of the Gulf, mainly from expat
investors,"" said a top banking executive in Bahrain.

 * Bank keeps key rate at 6 pct, in line with expectations
 * Rate-setting panel to be revamped by March, seen dovish
 
 (Adds parlt approval of new appointment rules)
 By Gergely Szakacs and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Hungary approved legislation on
Monday allowing the ruling Fidesz party to pick four new central
bankers, changes that may halt further official interest rate
rises and increase government influence over monetary policy.
 Earlier in the day the central bank (NBH) as expected kept
interest rates on hold at 6.0 percent at its last meeting before
four new members join its Monetary Council next month when the
mandates of four of the current rate setters expire.
 The government has criticised the council for raising
interest rates three times in as many months to defend the
bank's 3 percent medium-term inflation target.
 The European Central Bank, whose own independence is
enshrined in European Union law, has already spoken out against
the new appointment rules. It has also criticised pay cuts at
the Hungarian bank and the government's opposition to recent
rate decisions.
 Hungarian central bank governor Andras Simor warned the
government on Monday against continued interference.
 ""If market players think the central bank is not independent
and therefore they do not accept its decisions to be 100 percent
but speculate what the next month's decision might be, that ...
prevents the central bank acting according to its mission,"" he
said.
 The amendment to the central bank law will allow a
parliamentary committee, controlled by Fidesz, to fill all four
vacant spots on the council.
 Analysts have said the revamped panel was unlikely to rush
into reckless interest rate cuts but could adopt a more dovish
policy stance.
 Earlier this month Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Hungary
should work towards lowering inflation so that it can cut
interest rates, adding that the reshuffle would not lead to a
radical shift in central bank policy.
 Fidesz has kept a tight lid on the list of possible picks to
the rate-setting panel, even though several names were floated
in the local media as potential candidates.
 
 INFLATION RISKS
 The Council said earlier on Monday that the rate increases
of the past three months would contribute to inflation falling
to near the bank's 3 percent inflation target once the direct
impacts of cost-side shocks peter out.
 ""In the coming months, the Council will decide whether to
raise interest rates again after considering upside risks to
inflation,"" it said.
 Almost all analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the bank
to keep rates unchanged at Monday's meeting. Simor told a
news conference that the decision was made with a strong
majority. The rate-setting Monetary Council discussed keeping
rates on hold or cutting them by 25 basis points -- a rate hike
was not among the options.
However, Simor also warned that inflation expectations
remained unanchored.
 Elsewhere in central Europe, Poland's central bank also
raised rates for the first time last month and Czech officials
are expected to start tightening later this year.
 Analysts said the new Hungarian rate panel, which first
meets on Mar. 28, could be more open to government ideas of
using monetary stimulus to boost economic growth. 
 Others added that given a recent decline in inflation and
benign wage growth data, the new council could consider interest
rate cuts as early as the second quarter.
 ""Remember, this is the last MPC of the current membership
with the government set to put four of its own on the committee
from the next meeting and we therefore expect rate cuts late
this year as a result,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.

dispute is key to getting the country back on a stable outlook,
Fitch Ratings said, a day after the president triggered a vote
on paying back Britain and the Netherlands $5 billion of debt.
 President Olafur Grimsson said on Sunday he would not sign a
new Icesave bill approved by parliament last week, forcing the
crisis-hit country to hold a referendum on the new plan.
 Iceland owes Britain and the Netherlands money they used to
bail out domestic savers who lost money in online ""Icesave""
accounts run by one of its banks which collapsed during the
crisis in 2008.
 ""One of the key factors that would enable us to put it back
to stable would be an agreement on Icesave, and we haven't had
that yet,"" Paul Rawkins, Fitch's senior director for western
Europe, told Reuters.
 Fitch has Iceland on a BB+ non-investment grade rating with
a negative outlook.
 Rawkins said the referendum, which will not take place for
at least a month, could delay the lifting of strict capital
controls put in place during the crisis to stem an outflow of
funds from the country.
 ""Until it is resolved, it does restrict access to
international capital markets,"" he said.
 The central bank governor said earlier this month that some
limited moves to remove controls could come within the next six
months.
 This is the second time Iceland will vote on Icesave and
follows several months of negotiations between Icelandic, Dutch
and British officials on a new repayment plan.
 The Icelandic government wants a deal, but there is deep
resentment on the island. Many Icelanders believe it is unfair
that taxpayers must foot the bill for mistakes made by private
banks.
Rawkins added, however, that Icelandic voters appeared to be
more positive about the latest deal.
 ""It looks more promising this time around,"" he said. ""The
bill won quite broad party support in parliament. The sense we
get is that there is much more support this time around.""
 He added that he doubted the current deal with Britain and
the Netherlands would be superseded by a better offer.
 The next big hurdle for Iceland will be removing capital
controls, he said,though that is likely only to happen once
Icesave is out of the way.
 ""The vote is the first step really,"" he said.

(Adds quotes, background)
 PRAGUE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Czech economic growth will slow
down this year to 1.75 percent due to fiscal austerity at home
and abroad, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday.
The country's fiscal deficit will drop to around 4 percent
this year, but additional measures are needed to put the budget
on a sustainable path, especially due to population ageing, the
IMF said at the conclusion of a regular mission to the Czech
Republic.
 ""We expect the recovery in the Czech Republic to slacken in
2011 because of fiscal consolidation at home and abroad,"" said
Zuzana Murgasova, head of the mission.
 ""The 2011 budget is a significant step towawrds achieving
fiscal sustainability.""
 The Czechs aim to cut the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of
economic output in 2011 from 4.8 percent last year.
 The Finance Ministry and central bank have forecast a
slowing Czech economy this year. The ministry expects 2.2
percent growth and the bank, which has kept interest rates at
record lows since May, forecast growth at 1.6 percent.
 The IMF said monetary policy should remain accommodative
until the country's output gap starts closing at a significant
pace, but interest rates may need to go higher earlier if the
labour market tightens or inflation expectations grow.

 * Ruling party in total control of state
 * Security forces have history of cracking down
 * Low Internet, mobile phone penetration 
 
 By MacDonald Dzirutwe
 HARARE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe is unlikely to be forced out by a popular uprising like
those in Egypt and Tunisia and plans to entrench his 31-year
rule through elections later this year, analysts said.
 His election plans have angered impoverished Zimbabweans and
led to clashes between supporters of the ruling ZANU-PF party
and those of the MDC, formerly the main opposition, now his
uneasy coalition partner.
 The protests which toppled Hosni Mubarak and Zine al-Abidine
Ben Ali in Egypt and Tunisia have not gone unnoticed in Zimbabwe
but Mugabe's supporters have vowed to keep their elderly leader
in power.
 Political analysts say that while conditions are ripe for
mass anti-government protests, and Zimbabweans follow events in
the Arab world on satellite television, the ruling party's tight
control of the security forces and state institutions mean
protests are unlikely to succeed.
 Also, the Internet and mobile phones were used extensively
in Egypt and Tunisia to coordinate protests, but this would be
difficult in Zimbabwe where just over half the population have
mobile phones and only 12 percent have access to the Internet.
 ""There is so much less power and capacity to organise using
technology that we have seen in North Africa. This puts people
at a real disadvantage,"" said Sisonke Msimang, executive
director of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa.
 The army and police have a long history of cracking down on
opposition protests, and in the 1980s North Korean-trained
Zimbabwean troops killed thousands when they crushed a five-year
insurgency in Matabeleland province.
 Elections since 2002 have also been marked by violent state
crackdowns on the opposition. A disputed 2008 election was
marred by violence which the MDC says was orchestrated by the
military and left more than 200 of its supporters dead.
 Security chiefs, many of whom have been given farms seized
from white farmers, say they would not accept a president who
did not fight in the 1970s independence war, a reference to
Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe's long-time rival.
 ""It is not easy to get crowds onto streets in Zimbabwe, as
the security apparatus is thoroughly controlled by ZANU-PF and
they have not hesitated to intimidate and inflict pain on
dissenters or opposition members willing to protest,"" said Mark
Schroeder, sub-Saharan Africa analyst at Stratfor.
 
 CULTURE OF FEAR
 Security forces arrested dozens of activists at the weekend
on charges of plotting protests against Mugabe similar to those
that toppled the Egyptian and Tunisian leaders.
 As in Egypt, Tunisia and several Arab countries, Zimbabweans
are battling high levels of poverty and unemployment, decaying
infrastructure, diminishing freedoms, police brutality and
corrupt elites who continue to amass wealth.
 But there the similarities end.
 ""It is hard to imagine Zimbabweans can rise against the
government. I think it is possible but then the culture of fear
is just too much and not without reason,"" said Martin Chimeda,
who says he was brutalised by ZANU-PF members in 2008 for
organising for the MDC.
 Analysts say ZANU-PF's control of key state institutions and
use of state violence against defenceless citizens have crushed
people's willingness to rise against the ruling party.
 Mugabe, whom critics accuse of wrecking the economy with
policies such as the seizure of white-owned commercial farms,
has led the country since independence from Britain in 1980.
 After a decade of economic collapse and his violent
re-election in 2008, Mugabe was forced into a fragile coalition
with opposition leader Tsvangirai which has managed to stabilise
the economy and ease political tension.
 The economy last year grew for the second consecutive year,
ending shortages of basic goods, fuel and foreign currency,
though poverty and unemployment levels remain high.
 Now hope has turned to anger as billions in foreign aid,
expected after the unity government was formed in 2009, failed
to arrive because Western donors and investors were still
waiting for real political and economic reforms.
 Mugabe has rattled foreign investors with plans to force
foreign-owned firms, including banks and mines, to sell majority
shares to blacks, which critics say will hurt economic recovery.
 Analysts remain unsure what would drive Zimbabweans to a
tipping point. Past predictions that Mugabe would fall have
failed to materialise.
 ""There is no knowing what will cause Zimbabweans to jettison
their fear and confront their oppressors. All the ingredients
for a people-driven revolution are present in Zimbabwe,"" wrote
Trevor Ncube, a Zimbabwean who publishes South Africa's
influential Mail & Guardian weekly newspaper.
 Shunned by the West over charges of election rigging and
human rights abuses, Mugabe has increasingly looked to China to
prop up the resource-rich economy and says the West has imposed
sanctions on him to punish him for his land seizures.
 Mugabe marks his 87th birthday with a traditional private
family dinner on Monday. A lavish rally will be held on Feb. 26,
which he may use to give a timetable for the next elections.
 Revered by fanatical supporters who say he is a champion of
black empowerment and stands up to the West, Mugabe is equally
hated by opponents who label him a ruthless dictator.
 ""Comrade Mugabe is the only leader who can rule and we are
willing to defend the country so that we will not have a repeat
of what happened in Egypt,"" said Job Nhekairo, a father of four
who operates a electrical shop in Harare.

 * Sees Petrobras offshore development as a model
 * May buy new refineries but key focus on upstream
 
 (Adds quotes, details)
 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Russian oil major Rosneft will
outline offshore development and expansion abroad as two of its
key areas of growth when it publishes its new strategy later
this year, a top executive said on Monday.
 First Vice-President Pavel Fyodorov told a group of
reporters in London state-controlled Rosneft would soon make an
important announcement about acquiring offshore expertise but
could not comment whether it would be a new partnership or an
acquisition of assets or a team of specialists.
""Building valuable offshore expertise is a key priority for
us ... Offshore is where the company is undervalued by a factor
of three,"" Fyodorov said.
 ""We would be seeing ourselves much more as a global
diversifed energy leader rather than a one-market company""
 The strategy would follow the appointment of a new chief at
Rosneft last year and a landmark share swap and an Arctic
development deal between Rosneft and BP. 
 Fyodorov declined to comment whether Rosneft could buy out
the Russian partners in the TNK-BP venture, who have won a UK
court order blocking the deal with BP.
 Speaking about other trends in the new development strategy,
Fyodorov said the company would sharpen its investment focus
including divesting some non-core assets.
""I do hope that, with a few new hires that we will make,
there will be a much sharper focus on developing our
international presence and diversifying our fiscal exposure and
getting ourselves plugged into the global oil and gas industry"".
 Fyodorov said Rosneft was looking at other partnerships with
global oil majors like the BP deal as it seeks to become one of
the world's largest oil companies.
 ""We see (Brazil) Petrobras offshore business as a model for
us,"" he said adding the examples of Petrobras and Norway would
serve as a basis for a study, which Rosneft would present to the
government shortly, regarding a new offshore tax regime.
 Speaking about expansion abroad, Fyodorov said Rosneft would
mostly focus on upstream, including in Venezuela and new
projects in Africa.
 ""We see most of our value being created in upstream ... We
are very positive on upstream, neutral-to-positive on Russian
downstream ... We are being very selective with international
upstream, really picking up the best at lowest prices"".
 He also said Rosneft might look at expending its downstream
presence in Europe after having bought Venezuela's PDVSA assets
in Germany, Ruhr Oel.
 Speaking about Rosneft's new trading division in Geneva,
Fyodorov said it was set up primarily to coordinate crude
supplies to Ruhr Oel but added it did not necessarily mean that
an old-standing deal under which BP was the main supplier of
Ruhr Oel would be scrapped.
 He also said Rosneft was holding back the development of new
East Siberian fields, including the Yurubcheno-Takhomskoye
deposits, because it was inefficient under the current tax
regime.

 * EU briefing notes say Canada raises issue in trade talks
 * Canada denies threatening trade deal
 (Updates with Canadian reaction, paragraphs 7,8)
 By Pete Harrison and Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Canada has threatened to
scrap a trade deal with the European Union if the EU persists
with plans that would block imports of Canada's highly
polluting tar sands, according to EU documents and sources.
 The European Union has told its fuel suppliers to reduce
the carbon footprint of fuels by 6 percent over the next
decade, and is now fine-tuning ""default values"""" to help
suppliers identify the most carbon-intensive imports.
 Canada says the standards would instantly constrict a
possible future market for its oil sands -- tar-like oil that
is trapped in sediment and forms the world's second-largest
proven crude reserves after those of Saudi Arabia.
 ""Canada has been lobbying the Commission and member states
intensively to avoid a separate default value for fuel derived
from tar sands,"" said a briefing note prepared by EU officials
for climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard.
 ""It has raised the issue in the context of EU-Canada
negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement,"" adds the note, one of
several from last year released last week under
freedom-of-information laws.
 Sources said Monday that Canada had gone further,
threatening to void the free trade deal, which is expected to
be agreed later this year.
 Canadian officials denied they have threatened to scrap the
trade deal, but said they are concerned about how the oil sands
oil will be treated under the EU's fuel directive.
 ""Canada and the European Union are working to resolve the
issue outside of the negotiations towards a free trade deal,""
International Trade Minister Peter Van Loan said in a statement
to Reuters.
 Environmentalists oppose the tar sands industry, saying the
extra energy needed to extract oil from the site in the western
Canadian province of Alberta intensifies the impact on climate,
while polluted waste water harms wildlife and pollutes rivers.
 HIGHEST LEVEL
 The Commission is readying its defences for a legal fight
with Canada, EU officials say.
 Canada has challenged the EU at the World Trade
Organization in various disputes, such as over hormone-treated
beef, genetically modified foods and seal products.
 Last year, the EU appeared to be backing down on tar sands,
but sources say negotiators for the 27-member bloc are becoming
bolder as their scientific evidence becomes more robust.
 ""We are saying 'be careful', because Canada will not
hesitate to take us to the WTO, so we have to have something
rock-solid,"" said an EU official.
 The Commission had initially proposed that tar sands be
ascribed a greenhouse gas value of 107 grams per megajoule of
fuel, making it clear to buyers that it had far greater impact
than average crude oil at 87.1 grams.
 The latest EU research, published this month, backs that
up.
 A trade deal would open up Canadian public works contracts
to European bidders and allow Canada to capture sales -- from
auto parts and insurance to beef and grain -- currently
dominated by the United States and Asia.
 Numerous briefing notes sent between EU officials last year
show the issue has been raised at the highest levels. In May,
it was discussed during a meeting between EU President Jose
Manuel Barroso and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

 (Adds quote, detail, updates prices)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday as
worries stemming from rising tensions in the Middle East dented
risk sentiment, although it was underpinned by hawkish comments
from European Central Bank officials and robust euro-zone data.
 It lacked the vigour to break above key resistance after
Germany's main ruling party suffered a crushing defeat at a
regional election in the city-state of Hamburg on Sunday.
 While the defeat was expected, the margin was not. Analysts
said that ahead of the remaining state elections next month, the
waning popularity of the ruling coalition could suggest that
Angela Merkel's government may be less willing to compromise on
a comprehensive deal to solve Europe's debt problems or on
re-negotiation of Ireland's existing bailout.
 With the upcoming Irish general election on Friday likely to
see a party which is openly calling for a renegotiation of the
bailout agreement come to power, analysts say there is a risk
that the euro could come under pressure.
 Although this was yet to affect bond spreads, political
uncertainty is seen as negative for the single currency.
 ""With neither the core nor the periphery signalling
willingness to find a compromise on the issues, for now the
chances are that potential political impasses could erode euro
sentiment going forward,"" said Valentin Marinov, strategist at
Citi FX.
 The common currency was trading at $1.3660, down 0.2 percent
on the day, holding above near-term support at $1.3643, its
21-day moving average. It rose to $1.3727 earlier in the
session, the highest since Feb 10, helped by comments on Friday
from ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, that the
ECB would be ready to raise interest rates as needed to counter
inflationary pressures.
 Smaghi, who has sounded a hawkish tone several times in the
past month, said on Monday the euro zone is enjoying
better-than-expected growth and warned rises in food and fuel
prices may be becoming a permanent phenomenon.
 German business morale rose to a record high, a survey from
an influential think-tank showed, suggesting growth in the euro
zone's largest economy is gathering pace. It came after figures
showed activity in the euro zone's private sector grew more
quickly than expected this month.
 All of this lent support to the euro, but it still fell
short of testing major resistance around $1.3750, the 76.4
percent retracement of the February sell-off in the euro.
 ""Strong core European data is just not news for the euro any
more and positive rhetoric from euro zone policy makers and a
more hawkish ECB has been more or less priced into the market,""
said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at Barclays Capital.
 
 SAFE-HAVEN BIDS
 Some analysts said U.S. bond yields will also be a key
factor for the euro/dollar. Yields have dipped since hitting a
peak earlier this month as expectations of an early rate hike by
the Federal Reserve receded. If they fall further that could put
the dollar under more pressure.
 U.S. financial markets are closed for a holiday on Monday.
The increase in violence in Libya and the Middle East has pushed
Brent crude prices to a 2-1/2 year high -- which should be
dollar positive -- but investors have tended to sell the dollar
throughout the crisis due to worries over fallout for U.S.
foreign policy.
 ""The evidence from the last three great Middle-East related
oil price shocks suggests that this (a lack of dollar gains)
need not necessarily be the case (going forward),"" Simon
Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon,
wrote in a note.
 ""Indeed, there is good evidence to suggest that unless the
U.S. is actually caught up in events on the ground, then the
dollar could even represent a safe haven of sorts.""
 The dollar index held steady at 77.729.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2011 08:20AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Investors sift emerging markets for food-price bets," * Investors sift for food-spike beneficiaries
 * Latam, Asian growers and farm machinery firms top picks
 * Rural consumption comes to fore as farm wages rise

 By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Record-high commodity prices have
spurred a broad retreat from emerging markets but some investors
are bucking the trend, sifting through these economies in search
of selective winners from the rising cost of foodstuffs.
 Dwindling supplies of wheat, corn, soybean and oilseeds have
driven soft commodity prices to record highs, undermining
expectations of surging consumer demand in economies where
households can spend more than half of their incomes on food.
After a 16 percent gain last year, the benchmark emerging
equity index is down 3 percent this year, lagging the 5 percent
rise in global markets so far.
 Yet the impact of higher food prices is not uniformly
negative in these economies.
 ""Everybody's panicking about food prices because we're
looking at it from the urban perspective,"" said Jonathan
Schiessl, Asian equities investment manager at Ashburton.
 Investors have zeroed in on some commodity exporters as
outperformers while others are looking at sectors poised to
benefit as countries step up food production.
 In Argentina, one of the world's top wheat exporters, the
local stock benchmark hit lifetime highs last month while
expectations of higher palm oil prices fuelled the roughly
15 percent equity jump in Sri Lankan shares this year.
 As developing countries intensify efforts to boost farm
productivity, infrastructure and machinery firms such as China's
First Tractor Co. Ltd. and Indian utility vehicles maker
Mahindra and Mahindra are shaping up to be attractive bets.
 Rising rural incomes is another investment theme that has
come to the fore with the global focus on food production.
 Investors say farm wages in many developing economies should
rise in tandem with government efforts to raise crop yields.
This, in turn, is expected to fuel demand for consumer goods
among the rural population that remains dominant in many
developing economies.
 ""The most obvious winners from higher food prices are
farmers. We expect rural incomes to rise this year in China,
India and across commodity producing nations and we're looking
for companies that are selling directly into the rural economy,""
said Ashburton fund manager Schiessel said.
 These include firms that sell farming machinery as well as
those selling consumer staples such as cigarette maker ITC and
detergent-producer Jyothy Laboratories in India, he said.
 
 DOWN THE VALUE CHAIN
 Stock-pickers are, however, avoiding downstream
food-processing firms. Many are unable to pass on the higher
cost of their raw materials to consumers because some
governments have imposed price controls on food staples.
 ""Food producers don't benefit when commodity prices go up,""
said Hugo Rogers, who manages the $70 million Thames River Water
& Agriculture Absolute Return Fund.
 ""The further down the value chain, the lower beta and the
greater the inverse relationship between the commodity input and
the share price,"" he said.
 Among listed growers, Rogers favours Southeast Asian and
Latin American firms including palm-oil producers Golden Agri
and Brazil's SLC Agricola.
 Agricultural companies in these regions tend to face less
political interference over land ownership than peers in Russia
and Ukraine, he added.
 Of course, not all growers have gained from higher prices.
Catastrophic droughts and storms have hit harvests from
Australia to the United States and many growers have been unable
to take advantage of higher global grain prices.
 Russia and Ukraine, for instance, have curbed grain exports
to stabilise domestic supply. Even if less affected by the
vagaries of weather, others such as Argentina and Brazil are
trying to rein in the domestic fallout from higher food prices.
 Many investors will see that as an opportunity to raise
their exposure to emerging currencies, expecting governments to
allow these to appreciate faster to slow food prices rises for
domestic consumers.
 Also getting a second look are economies that face
relatively lower inflationary pressures and can afford to keep
monetary policy looser for longer.
 ""Hungary and the Czech Republic -- these countries are just
recovering from the downturn and the slack in their economies
from existing output gaps is helping to keep price increases
down,"" said Maarten Jan Bakkum, global emerging markets
strategist at ING Asset Management.
 South Africa's relatively mild consumer price pressure is
why UBS emerging markets currency strategist Marain Narik
favours holding the country's local-currency bonds.
 ""Food price increases are some of the lowest in emerging
markets ... Economic growth is improving but weak so the central
bank won't need to turn hawkish too quickly,"" he said.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2011 07:44AM ET</span>",EU energy laws threaten Nord Stream pipeline -Yazev," BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - European plans to liberalise
energy markets have undermined Russian investments, including
the second phase of the Nord Stream gas pipeline to Germany,
Russian Gas Society President Valery Yazev said on Monday.
 The EU's liberalisation laws seek to improve competition in
energy markets by breaking up gas and electricity monopolies to
allow smaller companies to gain easier access to infrastructure.
 That means imposing limits for gas suppliers on how much
infrastructure they are allowed to own.
 ""North Stream is going to launch pilot supplies of gas to
Germany -- one of the pipelines has already become certain. The
second one is suspended because it lost its attractiveness,""
Yazev told reporters in Brussels by video-conference.
 Yazev, who is also deputy chairman of the Russian State
Duma, said Prime Minister Vladimir Putin would raise energy
issues during a visit to the European Union's headquarters in
Brussels on Thursday.
 His society is pushing Russian negotiators to obtain
exemptions from liberalisation during the visit.
 ""We submitted our propositions to the Russian committee
which is in charge of holding a dialogue with the European
Commission about energy -- one of the fundamental propositions
is that the investments should be secured that have already been
made by Russian businesses,"" Yazev said via a translator.
 Yazev said Lithuania and Poland appeared to be interpreting
the laws in a literal fashion, which he said could lead to
higher prices for gas supplies from state-owned Gazprom.
 ""Poland and Lithuania opt for a very straightforward way --
they believe Gazprom should get out of the shareholder structure
of the projects,"" he said.
 ""There are certain risks... The prices for Lithuania would
be increased, because of more risks,"" he added.

 * Britain wants to boost Egypt trade, security ties
 
 By Mohammed Abbas
 CAIRO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Britain's prime minister, visiting
Egypt on Monday on the first trip by a foreign leader since
President Hosni Mubarak's overthrow, will push for an end to
emergency law but will not meet Islamists.
 The revolt in Egypt and uprisings across the region have
prompted Western governments to rethink their policies of
supporting autocratic leaders, but raised concerns about the
potential rise of Islamist groups in their place.
 Egypt is now governed by a military council, led by veteran
Defence Minister Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who is
on the list of officials British Prime Minister David Cameron
will be meeting.
 ""I think this is a great opportunity to talk to those
currently running Egypt to make sure this really is a genuine
transition from military rule to civilian rule,"" Cameron told
reporters on the plane before landing in Cairo.
 He will also meet members of the anti-Mubarak opposition.
But an official travelling with Cameron said he would not meet
members of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's most organised
political grouping.
 British officials say it would be a positive sign to meet
other, less organised opposition groups than the Brotherhood, to
highlight the fact that Islamists are not the only alternative
to Mubarak.
 ""We have got very important trading relationships we want to
expand. We have got a very important security relationship, not
least in combating extremist terror, that we need to sharpen and
increase,"" Cameron said.
 A British official said Cameron would push for an end to
emergency laws that were in place during Mubarak's 30-year rule
and were used to stifle dissent. Lifting the emergency laws has
been one of the main demands of the protesters.
 British officials said they saw British investment in Egypt
increasing, and that this was an important way to help create
economic opportunities and promote stability.
 Uprisings that began with the toppling of Tunisia's leader
in January have spread like wildfire across the Middle East,
including to Egypt's neighbour Libya. More than 200 people have
been killed as veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi tries to crush a
popular revolt.
 ""What is happening in Libya is completely appalling and
unacceptable as the regime is using the most vicious forms of
repression,"" Cameron said.
 Dozens of people were reported killed in Tripoli overnight
as anti-government protests reached the Libyan capital for the
first time.

 BEIJING, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Beijing charged Washington with
blocking Chinese investment in U.S. companies after telecom gear
maker Huawei dropped buying assets from server technology
provider 3Leaf.
 The ministry of commerce said ""the U.S. side has used all
kinds of excuses, including national security, to engage in

 ""This purchase of 3Leaf technology assets by Huawei was

over the outcome,"" an unnamed official said in a statement on
the ministry website (www.mofcom.gov.cn).
 ""To some extent, this obstruction and interference is
affecting China-U.S. trade and economic cooperation,"" said the
ministry, which encourages Chinese firms to expand overseas.
 Huawei bought assets from 3Leaf for $2 million last May but
Huawei said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States (CFIUS) suggested the Chinese company divest them.
 Critics of Huawei, which was founded by a former People's
Liberation Army officer, says it maintains links with China's
security services.
 Huawei has repeatedly denied the links but the claims have
dogged its dealings with Washington.
 The company gave up a bid for 3Com in 2008 due to security
concerns. In 2010, U.S. Republican lawmakers raised national
security concerns about Huawei's bid to supply mobile equipment
to Sprint Nextel Corp.
 For Huawei is the third biggest mobile gear maker behind
Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks.
 CFIUS is a U.S. government panel that reviews deals with
national security implications.
 Huawei's European rivals have also complained about Huawei
and smaller Chinese counterpart ZTE getting state support in the
form of loans and undercutting them on price.

 * Share price dips 1.8 percent

(Updates shares, adds further background)
 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Part-nationalised British bank
Lloyds will take a 500 million pound provision after reaching a
deal with the Financial Services Authority to handle complaints
over some of its mortgages.
 Lloyds, the UK's biggest retail bank, said it had reached a
voluntary agreement with the FSA over initiating a customer
review and contact programme with regard to concerns over some
of its retail mortgage contracts.
 Lloyds added that the agreement with the FSA related to
mortgage customers of its Halifax unit, where the wording in
certain mortgage offer documents had the potential to cause
confusion.
 Lloyds's Halifax division said it would write to around
600,000 customers from April onwards to clear up the confusion
and would make goodwill payments to around 300,000 of those
customers.
 Lloyds acquired the Halifax business following its purchase
of rival HBOS during the height of the credit crisis in 2008.
 The HBOS takeover, which was brokered by the then Labour
government, saddled Lloyds with billions of pounds of losses and
led the British government to step in and bail it out with
taxpayers' money.
 As a result of the bailout, the British government ended up
with a stake of around 41 percent in Lloyds.
 Lloyds shares were down 1.9 percent at 1150 GMT, making it
one of the worst-performing stocks on Britain's benchmark FTSE
100 index, along with rival part-nationalised bank Royal Bank of
Scotland, whose shares were down by 2.5 percent.
 RBS and Lloyds report full-year results later this week, and
both banks' earnings are expected to be hit by their exposure to
Ireland's economic problems and by bad debt charges.

 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Emerging equities stalled on
Monday and most Gulf stock markets extended recent losses amid
worries about the potential fallout from Libya's deadly clashes
but strong euro zone economic data provided some reassurance.
 Emerging Europe however got a boost from a healthy reading
for private sector activity and data showing German business
sentiment improved for the ninth straight month in February. 
 Broader emerging stocks eased slightly, taking a cue from
European markets which were undermined by Libya-exposed stocks
such as oil firms ENI and OMV. However, the firms' debt
insurance costs did not show a significant rise.
 Emerging stocks had gained over 2 percent last week -- the
best weekly performance in seven weeks.
 Eastern European stocks slipped 0.5 percent though Prague, a
big beneficiary of Germany's recovery, rose 0.7 percent. Turkish
stocks fell almost 1 percent.
 ""It's a quiet day with the U.S. closed for a holiday and
there's surprisingly little impact from the unrest in the Middle
East. People are talking about events in Bahrain and Libya but
it's not really having an impact on investor sentiment,"" said
Nigel Rendell, emerging markets strategist at RBC Capital
Markets.
 ""The strong reading of German business sentiment is positive
especially for eastern and central Europe,"" he added.
 Oil prices rose to a new 2-1/2 year high due to increasing
violence in Libya, feeding fears about inflation especially in
emerging markets, and restraining equity gains. But Russia
reaped some of the immediate gains, its commodity-dominated
bourse rising 0.8 percent.
 South African stocks also benefited from a jump in
safe-haven gold to the highest since early January.
 Investors were more bearish on the Middle East, where the
small markets including Qatar and UAE extended losses.
 Qatar fell 0.8 percent, having lost 8 percent since
mid-January. Dubai's main index fell 1.3 percent to a September
2 low and Abu Dhabi lost 0.5 percent 
 ""There aren't worries of a domino effect into Qatar, the
UAE, and Oman. This is more of an overall investor regional
confidence issue,"" said Akram Annous, MENA strategist at Al Mal
Capital in Dubai.
 ""There is now a perception of elevated risk in the Gulf, and
that is not going to disappear overnight. Markets will continue
to struggle with discounting this element."" 
 Bahrain's most-traded 2014 Islamic bond fell to a fresh
11-month low while Bahrain's dinar currency weakened further in
the forwards market though it remained off recent seven-month
lows.
 Debt insurance costs for Middle Eastern sovereigns continued
to rise, with Bahrain 5-year credit default swaps 8 basis points
higher at a new 18-month high of 305 bps. Dubai rose 9 bps to
440 bps while Israel also inched higher to a new 19-month high.
 
 CENTRAL BANK WATCH
 Israel's central bank was also the focus of attention as it
is expected to raise rates by a quarter point on Monday for the
second straight month to 2.5 percent, with the recent strong
growth number prompting some analysts to predict a 50 bps rise.
 The shekel was near a one-month high, unfazed by
policymakers' resolve to curb the currency's gains.
 Emerging European currencies were mixed, with the rouble
hitting a 9-month high against the dollar but the Turkish lira
shed almost 0.4 percent.
 The rouble was receiving support from the oil prices and
also from the prospect of a long-delayed sovereign rouble
Eurobond for up to $3 billion this week.
 However, the Polish zloty and Hungarian forint fell around
0.4 percent versus the euro.
 The zloty took a hit after central bank Governor Marek Belka
said the January rate rise should not be followed by a ""cascade""
of rate hikes..
 Poland started tightening policy last month, raising the
main rate to 3.75 percent from a record low. Markets have been
betting the Monetary Policy Council will follow that with
another rate hike in March. 
 In Hungary the central bank is expected to leave interest
rates on hold after tightening policy three times.
 ""We do not expect to see a significant impact on the
currency following the decision and at a margin we still favour
forint longs,"",BNP Paribas analysts said, adding that the pause
should end the recent underperformance of the long end of the
Hungarian bond curve.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices charged to fresh 2-1/2
year highs on Monday as traders reacted to increasing violence
in major producer Libya, which fed investor fears about rising
inflation and unsettled other markets.
 Globally, equities were lower but U.S. markets were closed
for a holiday.
 European equities lost more than 1 percent on a combination
of uncertainty over the future of the oil price, increasing
signs that higher interest rates may be coming and more evidence
of a surprisingly poor earnings season.
 Together, the worries overshadowed reports of solid European
economic growth.
 Gold powered to its highest levels in seven weeks, above
$1,400 an ounce, helped along by both inflation fears and risk
aversion.
 Protests broke out in the Libyan capital Tripoli for the
first time following days of unrest in the city of Benghazi and
some army units defected to the opposition in what has become
one of the bloodiest revolts to convulse the Arab world.
[ID:nLDE71K01F]
 Financial markets are particularly sensitive to the violence
in Libya because it exports around 1.1 million barrels per day
of crude.
 Brent crude  gained $2.50 a barrel to hit a new 2-1/2
year high above $105.
 Rising oil prices feed into inflation, one of the main
current concerns of investors, who are otherwise in a generally
bullish mood on expectations that the global economic recovery
is now sustainable.
 ""The situation in Libya looks pretty bad and we're seeing
safe-haven flows on the back of that,"" said Alan McQuaid, chief
economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was down 0.3 percent
and the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed down 1.3 percent.
 The European weakness came despite euro zone manufacturing
data above consensus and the strongest Ifo sentiment data out of
Germany since reunification.
 European stocks have been hit by mixed earnings. Thomson
Reuters Proprietary Research reported on Monday that the number
of European companies missing fourth quarter expectations is
outpacing those beating them.
 The earnings growth rate, actual and predicted, for the
STOXX 600 is 18.9 percent, compared with a December estimate of
36.1 percent.
 Shares in Carlsberg , for example, fell on Monday
after the brewer posted a surprise fall in fourth-quarter
operating profit.
 
 EURO WAVERS
 The euro slipped as the rising tensions in the Middle East
dented risk sentiment.
 But it earlier hit its its highest level in more than 10
days against a background of hawkish comments from European
Central Bank officials that added to expectations a rise in
interest rates is on the way this year. [ID:nTOE71K03D]
 The common currency was trading at $1.3670 , down
around 0.1 percent on the day. It rose to $1.3727 earlier in the
session, the highest since Feb. 10, extending a rise on Friday
that was also related to comments from an ECB Executive Board
member.
 With an Irish election on Friday likely to put in power a
party which is openly calling for a renegotiation of its EU
bailout agreement, strategists say there is a risk that the euro
could come under pressure.
 Euro zone policymakers are also struggling toward a more
comprehensive package that they hope can put an end to debt
troubles.
 ""With neither the core nor the periphery signalling
willingness to find a compromise on the issues for now, the
chances are that potential political impasses could erode euro
sentiment going forward,"" said Valentin Marinov, strategist at
Citi FX.
 Core euro zone bond yields were lower as investors bought
safer assets in the face of the Middle East and North Africa
events.

 * German Ifo numbers beat expectations
 * Merkel party's defeat weighs on euro sentiment
 
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The euro was firm on Monday,
having hit its highest level in more than 10 days, drawing
support from hawkish comments from European Central Bank
officials and robust economic data.
 But traders said the euro seemed contained by the hawkish
ECB rhetoric on one side and the risk-off sentiment stemming
from North Africa and the Middle East on the other.
 It also lacked the vigour to break above key resistances
after Germany's main ruling party suffered a crushing defeat at
a regional election in the city-state of Hamburg on Sunday..
 While the defeat was expected, the margin was not. Analysts
said that ahead of the remaining state elections next month, the
waning popularity of the ruling coalition could suggest that
Angela Merkel's government may be less willing to compromise on
thorny issues like striking a quick agreement on the euro zone
debt crisis or re-negotiation of the Irish bailout.
 With the upcoming Irish general election on Friday likely
see a party which is openly calling for a renegotiation of the
bailout agreement come to power, analysts say there is a risk
that the euro could come under pressure.
 ""With neither the core nor the periphery signaling
willingness to find a compromise on the issues for now the
chances are that potential political impasses could erode euro
sentiment going forward,"" said Valentin Marinov, strategist at
Citi FX.
 ""In the very near term, however, investors seem preoccupied
with the inflation and rate outlook for the euro area.""
 The common currency was trading at $1.3705, up 0.1 percent
on the day. It rose to $1.3727 earlier in the session, the
highest since Feb. 10, extending its rise sparked by comments on
Friday from ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi that
the bank stood ready to raise rates as needed to counter
inflationary pressures.
 Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny chimed on Monday in
when he told a newspaper that while the ECB saw no signs of
second-round inflationary effects at the moment, it was closely
monitoring rising energy and food prices.
 Key German Ifo survey suggested growth in the euro zone's
largest economy was gathering pace and those came after figures
showed activity in the euro zone's private sector grew more
quickly than expected this month.
 All of which lent considerable support to the euro but it
still fell short of testing major resistance around $1.3750,
including the currency's Feb. 9 peak of $1.3745.
 
 DOLLAR/YEN COULD RISE
 Some analysts said U.S. bond yields will also be a key
factor for the euro/dollar. U.S. bond yields have been dipping
since hitting a peak earlier this month as expectations of an
early rate hike by the Federal Reserve recede. If, they fall
further, that could see the dollar under more pressure.
 U.S. financial markets are closed for a holiday on Monday.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, held steady at 77.673, not
far from its Feb. 9 low of 77.504.
 Against the yen, the dollar inched up to 83.10 yen, but well
below a two-month high of 83.98 yen last Wednesday on trading
platform EBS.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Friday that speculators held net yen short positions
for the first time since June in the week to Feb. 15.
 The data surprised traders because the change in their
positioning - to a net yen short position of 18,548 contracts
from net yen long of 36,731 contracts - was the largest since
February 2004..
 Gareth Berry, an analyst at UBS Investment Bank in
Singapore, said the shift in positions points to a sharp swing
in sentiment that could bode well for the dollar.
 ""I think most investors are pretty convinced that dollar/yen
is about to rise...and they are now waiting for a good entry
point,"" Berry said, adding that the dollar could rise to 85 yen
over the next month.
 ""That positioning data...could be the signal that will
convince a lot of investors to say right now is the time.""

 LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Activity in the euro zone's
private sector grew faster than expected this month,
particularly in the bloc's factories, but the upturn is driving
prices higher, business surveys showed on Monday.
 Germany, Europe's biggest economy, continued to lead the way
but peripheral members that had been languishing in a downturn
also saw an upswing.
 Markit's Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI leapt to a near
11-year high of 59.0 from 57.3 in January beating expectations

 The flash euro zone services PMI, which measures activity in
companies ranging from banks to hotels, rose to 57.2 from 55.9
in January, its highest reading since August 2007 and marking
its 18th month above the 50 point dividing growth from
contraction.
 Economists had predicted only a slight uptick to 56.0.
 ""Manufacturing is really powering ahead. Services are still
lagging manufacturing but that just reflects the superb rate of
growth,"" said Markit's Chris Williamson.
 Earlier data from Germany showed its services PMI dipped to
59.5 this month from January's 60.3 but the pace of growth in
its manufacturing sector picked up speed, with the PMI for that
sector rising to the highest in the survey's 15-year history.
 Next door in France both sectors also saw an upturn.
 ""France and Germany's differential is narrowing in terms of
output but also the differential with the rest of the euro zone
is narrowing as well. Manufacturing outside of France and
Germany is positively surging now,"" Williamson said.
 The euro zone composite index, compiled from the services
and manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall
growth, bounced to 58.4 this month from 57.0 in January,
smashing expectations for 56.9 and notching up its highest
reading since July 2006.
 The numbers, if little changed next month, are in line with
first quarter growth of around 0.7 percent, Markit said.
 The bloc's economy grew 0.3 percent in the final three
months of 2010 and economists polled by Reuters don't expect a
strong pick up anytime soon..
 
 PRICE PRESSURES
 Input prices in the manufacturing sector rose at their
fastest pace in the survey's near 14-year history as the cost of
raw materials and energy soared. The indicator jumped to 85.7
this month from 79.2 in January.
 The output price index also climbed to a survey high,
suggesting firms were able to pass on some of the increases to
customers.
 Euro zone inflation jumped more than expected in January,
rising well above the European Central Bank's two-percent target
ceiling. Official early estimates suggest prices rose 2.4
percent year-on-year last month.
 Data released earlier this month showed unemployment in the
euro zone held steady at 10.0 percent in December, hovering near
a 12-year high.
 The outlook for the dominant service sector is also
improving with the new business index rising to 56.4 this month
from January's 55.9, its highest level since August 2007.
 Firms hired workers at a faster pace this month, reversing a
recent trend, with the composite employment index rising to 52.8
from January's 52.1.

 * Services sector hits some short-term capacity constraints
 * PMI points to 1.2 pct first quarter German economic growth
 
 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Record growth in Germany's
manufacturing industry powered a strong expansion of its private
sector in February, a purchasing managers' survey showed on
Monday, defying fears the recovery could be easing.
 The flash estimate from data compiler Markit showed a
reading for the manufacturing sector of 62.6, an all-time high
for the series, which began in April 1996. Readings above the 50
mark denote expansion and those below it point to contraction.
 ""Exports are driving growth in the manufacturing sector, but
there is also gathering momentum in the domestic economy,"" said
Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit.
 Service providers also signalled strong growth in business
activity, with the rate of expansion only fractionally slower
than the near four-and-a-half year high seen in January.
 ""There is a very high expansion in the services sector which
is very dependent on household spending, so it's a good
indicator that the domestic economy is picking up,"" said
Williamson.
 The Markit flash estimate for the services sector expansion
fell slightly to 59.5 in February from 60.3.
 ""You could find that we are hitting some short-term capacity
issues in Germany which are limiting growth,"" said Williamson.
""There are backlogs of work arising at a record pace, but
employment growth slowed and we can count a number of instances
in which there were difficulties in recruiting staff.""
 A composite reading that includes both services and the
manufacturing sector rose to 61.5, equal to the survey-record
high posted in June 2006.
 
 INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
 Analysts are watching the German and broader euro zone
economy carefully for signs of whether momentum can be
maintained in the face of easing growth elsewhere and public
spending cutbacks.
 Data last week showed German industry orders and output fell
in December but Williamson dismissed this as a ""blip"" partly due
to bad weather, and said the recovery remained well on track.
 He said Markit's current PMI data implied a growth rate of
1.2 percent for the first quarter, versus 0.7 percent for the
euro zone overall, ""but it could be even stronger if that fourth
quarter number was depressed by bad weather.""
 Williamson tempered fears that Germany's economy was leaving
smaller euro zone states like Ireland and Portugal behind as
they struggled with austerity measures to contain a debt crisis.
 ""What we are hopefully seeing is that the strong growth in
Germany is now benefitting other countries in Europe and not
just immediate neighbours,"" said Williamson.
 Strong growth in Germany, however, was fuelling inflationary
pressures, with input price inflation in the manufacturing
sector by far the fastest seen in the survey history.
 Williamson said these input price pressures were feeding
through to selling prices, and would likely put pressure on
wages too, especially given the robust labour market.
 ""There are signs of difficulties recruiting staff in the
services sector and the manufacturing sector is employing people
at a record rate,"" he said. ""This sort of employment growth
rarely lasts for long without generating pay pressures.""
 Some economists fear demands for wage hikes will lead to a
wage-price spiral. Volkswagen and German unions agreed to a hike
of 3.2 percent earlier this month, which raises the prospect of
other sectors gaining similar inflation-busting increases this
year.

 * Tense compromise keeps China involved in process
 * G20 faces tough challenge agreeing how to use indicators
 * Falling Chinese trade surplus may ease pressure
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A hard-fought compromise saved a
weekend G20 meeting from failure by winning Chinese backing for
a set of indicators on economic imbalances, but the divided
group faces a tougher task agreeing on how to use the list.
 Saturday's deal was a first step toward a framework for G20
nations to monitor each other's economies with the aim of
avoiding a repeat of the global crisis, triggered by the
bursting of a U.S. credit bubble funded by Asian savings.
 The idea of a list was launched at a November G20 summit in
Seoul to defuse tensions from U.S. allegations that Beijing was
keeping its yuan currency undervalued to boost its exports.
 But China's refusal to include exchange rates and currency
reserves threatened to block a deal until the tense final
moments of the talks, when rich nations agreed to drop them.
 China also succeeded in removing a reference to current
account imbalances in favor of the more narrow trade balance,
where Beijing expects its surplus to shrink as it boosts
domestic demand under a five-year plan.
 But there were also victories for developed countries, which
won inclusion of net investment income flows, a measure of
interest on Beijing's nearly $3 trillion in reserves. More
importantly, they secured a commitment from China, which had
been reticent, to move ahead with the process.
 ""China gave in to a precise set of indicators but ensured
that exchange rates and current accounts were not singled out,""
said Luca Ricci, head of international economic research at
Barclays capital. ""The problem is that having more indicators is
not going to make it easier to reach concrete steps that can
bring effective solutions to the global imbalances.""
 ""The traditional issues are still there: the United States
wants China to have a stronger exchange rate and more domestic
demand,"" he said, ""And China wants to support exports via a weak
exchange rate and, because it has weaker banks than some
countries, doesn't want to open up its capital account.""

 ECONOMIC CHANGES MAY EASE PRESSURE
 France, which chairs the Group of 20 this year, has said it
aims to reach an agreement on the next step in the process -- a
set of ""indicative guidelines"" for using the indicators -- at a
G20 finance ministers meeting in mid-April in Washington.
 Saturday's communique said the guidelines would take into
account specific circumstances, like commodities producers such
as Saudi Arabia with large trade surpluses. It also stated that
these guidelines would not be ""targets.""
 Despite such caveats, members countries were quick to
establish their red lines. Gerhard Schaeuble, finance minister
of world No. 2 exporter Germany, said after talks ended that
there would be no numerical targets on some indicators.
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the tense
talks reflected the resurgence of national interests in the wake
of the crisis -- undermining the G20 two years after it helped
broker a deal to pull the world economic back from the brink.
 ""What I was worried about, I'm sorry to say, materialized,
which is that it's more difficult than before to have people
agree,"" he said. ""Our task to reach this consensus was not even
that difficult.""
 France's attempts to gradually draw China into a dialogue on
its currency met with scant success. Central Bank Governor Zhou
Xiaochuan said China would not be pushed into faster yuan
appreciation, nor did Beijing offer more flexibility to win a
place for the yuan in the basket of currencies backing the IMF's
Special Drawing Right assets, as France has suggested.
 But China did agree to host a seminar on reform of the
international monetary system in Shenzhen in late March, with
the involvement of the central bank and foreign ministry.
 Barclays' Ricci said that in the wake of the crisis tensions
over global imbalances may ease as the U.S. Federal Reserve
winds down its quantitative easing, relieving some pressures on
prices and exchange rates in emerging countries.
 The absence of cheap money could also remind Washington that
it needs China's savings to help fund its large deficit.
 ""If, as we expect, emerging market countries including China
also gradually increase their domestic demand then the issue of
global imbalances will become less pressing,"" Ricci said.
 ""The G20 has a role to play in bringing countries together
for discussions, but I would not focus just on these economic
indicators. Financial sector reform is an area where it has made
a lot of progress and there is probably a lot more to come.""

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped by over a
dollar and Asian shares mostly eased on Monday as spreading
tensions in Libya and other oil-producing regions encouraged
some mild profit taking after last week's solid gains.	
 Further increases in oil prices may see selling pressure
intensify in regional markets which have only recently begun to
recover from a sharp selloff in the opening weeks of 2011.	
 Higher prices will pose fresh headaches for authorities
already struggling to re-establish their inflation-fighting
credentials in the face of rising food prices.	
 ""I would be worried if the unrest spreads to Saudi Arabia,""
said Benson Wang of Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.	
 Brent crude oil futures and U.S. crude futures
both vaulted more than $1/bbl to $103.75 and $87.39 per
barrel respectively, while gold prices inched higher,
adding to last week's gains of nearly 3 percent.	
 Anti-government protesters rallied in Tripoli's streets at
the weekend, tribal leaders spoke out against leader Muammar
Gaddafi, and army units defected to the opposition as oil
exporter Libya endured one of the bloodiest revolts to convulse
the Arab world. 
 The MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
slipped by half a percent after posting its best
weekly performance in two months last week. The energy sub-index
rose 0.5 percent, the outperformer for the day.	
 The Nikkei ended 0.1 percent higher.	
 
 
 Beijing's latest move to tighten policy in the form of
raising banks' required reserves saw Shanghai and Hong
Kong stocks slip early, but Shanghai later reversed the
losses, rising about 0.6 percent. 
 ""There are few buying or selling cues in the domestic
market. Investors will likely stay alert to geopolitical news
that could affect markets across the world,"" said Hikaru Sato, a
senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Market.	
 ""The Middle East continues to be a focus, while there are
concerns about China.""	
 Asia-ex Japan equity funds saw the biggest weekly outflows
in the second week of February in three years while Japan funds
posted their biggest weekly inflow in four years, data from fund
tracker EPFR Global showed.
 Moreover, concerns that a breathtaking rally in U.S. stocks
in recent weeks, which has boosted the region's developed
markets such as Australia and Tokyo may be
nearing a close, also weighed on sentiment.	
 U.S. markets are shut on Monday for a public holiday.	
 China's benchmark short-term money market rate
soared more than 300 basis points on Monday after Beijing on
Friday raised required reserves for banks by 50 basis points to
a record 19.5 percent. .	
 
 FX VIEW BRIGHTENS	
 The foggy outlook for equities in the near term is in sharp
contrast to the view emerging in the region's currency markets,
where analysts are calling for more gains.	
 Barring the baht, yen and the rupee, all other Asian
currencies have posted substantial gains so far this year,
indicating authorities are allowing more currency strength to
tackle inflation.	
 A monthly Reuters poll showed investors increased their long
positions on the Indonesian rupiah, Singapore dollar, Philippine
peso and the Chinese yuan while Standard Chartered strategists
recommended overweight bets on Asian currencies. 
 China's move to nudge the yuan to a record high
in recent weeks has also fueled gains. .	
 The euro held firm near two-week highs after hawkish
comments from a European Central Bank official kept alive the
prospects for the ECB to hike rates before the Fed. .	
 The G20 meeting's outcome had little impact on markets after
policymakers reached a fudged accord on how to measure
imbalances in the global economy after China prevented the use
of exchange rates and currency reserves as indicators.

 By Farah Master
 HONG KONG, Feb 21 (Reuters) - European Central Bank board
member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on Monday the euro zone is
enjoying better-than-expected economic growth, but warned
inflation is becoming a concern and higher food and energy
prices may be permanent.
 ""Things are better than expected in terms of growth (and)
unemployment,"" Bini Smaghi told a business lunch in Hong Kong.
 In a speech that focused on the financial turmoil in Europe
and prospects for the euro currency, he said there were concerns
in the financial markets about euro zone's higher-than-expected
inflation and warned that higher energy and food prices may be
something economies have to get used to.
 ""Inflation is higher than expected because of global events.
We all have to understand to what extent this higher inflation
is due to temporary or a longer underlying phenomenon,"" he said.
 ""There is pressure on prices of agricultural products and
this may not be a temporary phenomenon, it may be a permanent
one, the same for energy.""
 Bini Smaghi has delivered a string of speeches in recent
weeks warning that the rise of oil, commodity and food prices is
likely to be more than just a temporary spike.
 The ECB was keeping a close eye on price trends, he said.
 ""In our case, we (the ECB) have a clear objective which is
to look at inflation and to avoid inflation,"" he said, adding
the bank would have to assess the impact of imported energy and
food price inflation.
 On Friday, Bini Smaghi said that the ECB could use its
monetary policy in a pre-emptive fashion to head off inflation.
[ID:nLDE71H1DZ]
 His latest comments helped the euro  pare most of its
early losses against the dollar in Asian trade on Monday,
keeping alive the prospect that the ECB may raise interest rates
before the U.S. Federal Reserve. [FRX/]
 He would not comment on whether the ECB would upgrade
inflation targets in a forecast to be released two weeks from
now. (for previous forecasts click [ID:nLDE6B01HK])
 ""We will update it and we will see what the result is,"" he
said.
 
 STRONG DATA
 ECB policymakers have sounded increasingly aggressive on
inflation since the beginning of the year. Euro zone inflation
accelerated to 2.4 percent in January, the highest in more than
two years and further above the ECB's target of below but close
to 2 percent.
 Athanasios Orphanides, another of ECB's top policymakers,
said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday that
it cannot be ruled out that euro zone inflation will stay above
the ECB's target of just under 2 percent for longer than
expected. [ID:nWLB4728] 
 Austrian central bank governor, Ewald Nowotny, added his
voice to the concerns, saying the ECB was watching developments
very closely but that at present there appeared to be no sign of
second round effects. [ID:nLDE71K0CI]
 Fresh data on manufacturing and German sentiment bolstered
the ECB's current belief that the euro zone recovery remains on
track and is keeping upward pressure on inflation.
 Activity in the euro zone's factories and private sector
grew faster than expected this month and is pushing up prices,
new data on Monday showed. Closely-watched German business
sentiment also improved in February. [ID:nBEB004491]
 Bini Smaghi also said that reforms needed to be implemented
in euro zone countries in which growth was slower, adding that
Italy needed to adopt reforms to stimulate growth, and its
budget needed further cuts to stabilise debt.
 Commenting whether a single fiscal policy would be
beneficial to the entire eurozone, he said he does not think
such a policy is appropriate and that ""decentralised policy is
not necessarily bad.""
 He encouraged banks in eurozone not to be ""too easy-going,""
and urged them not to rely on ECB credit, and to return to
capital market as soon as possible.

 By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The euro held firm near its
highest level in more than 10 days on Monday after a European
Central Bank official kept alive the prospect of the ECB hiking
rates before the Fed.
 But it lacked the vigour to break above key resistances after
Germany's main ruling party suffered a crushing defeat at a
regional election in the city-state of Hamburg on Sunday, making
it harder for Chancellor Angela Merkel to pass federal
legislation.
 ""I think the German ruling party's loss in an election in
Hamburg is making it difficult to pursue the euro's upside for
now,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The common currency was trading at $1.3688, flat from late
U.S. trade last week.
 It briefly rose to a one-week high of $1.3727 in early Monday
trade, extending its rise sparked by comments on Friday from ECB
Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi that the bank stood
ready to raise rates as needed to counter inflationary pressures.
 But it did not have enough energy to test major resistance
around $1.3750, including the currency's Feb. 9 peak of $1.3745.
 ""As the euro has been ploughing a rough $1.3450-$1.3750 range
in the past two weeks, a break of $1.3750 could push the euro
into a new trading range,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer
at Chuo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo.
 ""U.S. bond yields will hold the key. If they fall further,
that could lead to another round of selling the dollar,"" Kitakura
added.
 U.S. bond yields have been dipping since hitting a peak
earlier this month as expectations of an early rate hike by the
Federal Reserve recede.
 That has helped to pin down the dollar index, which tracks
the greenback's performance against a basket of major currencies,
near its lowest level in nearly two weeks.
 The index was was flat at 77.635, just shy of its Feb. 9 low
of 77.504. A break there could open the way for test of
three-month low of 77.681 hit earlier this month.
 But with U.S. financial markets closed for a holiday, the
market may be looking to European economic data, including
Germany's Ifo business climate survey for clues in the near term.
 Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 83.13 yen,
not far from a one-week low near 83.00 plumbed last Friday.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Friday that speculators held net yen short positions
for the first time since June in the week to Feb. 15.
 The data surprised traders because the change in their
positioning - to a net yen short position of 18,548 contracts
from net yen long of 36,731 contracts - was the largest in many
years.
 Traders were also surprised that the dollar gained less than
1.5 yen during this period despite such a large shift in
speculators' positioning, suggesting heavy selling pressure
around 84 yen.
 Dealers were keeping a wary eye on developments in the
Middle East and particularly Libya and Bahrain, where
anti-government protests were gathering pace.
 If tensions in the Middle East prompts investors to shun
risk, that could put pressure on growth-leveraged currencies such
as the Australian dollar, and help the safe-haven Swiss franc,
some traders said.
 AUSSIE SLIP
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $1.0130, not
helped by Chinese tightening late last week.
 But the currency stayed still near 1-½ week highs around
$1.0158 set last Friday.
 Stepping up its fight to subdue stubbornly high inflation,
Beijing last Friday raised banks' required reserves to a record
19.5 percent, meaning the country's lenders will have to lock up
a bigger chunk of their deposits at the central bank instead of
lending them out.
 Some traders think the Australian currency has weathered a
series of Chinese tightening extremely well.
 So far this year, markets have greeted China's tightening
measures with relief, rather than panic that these moves will
threaten to derail economic growth.
 The change in market attitudes has helped underpin the
Aussie, whose fortunes are closely tied to Beijing's policy,
given that China is now the nation's biggest export market.
 The outcome of the G20 meeting had little impact on markets.
Finance ministers of the world's major economies reached a
fudged accord on how to measure imbalances in the global economy
after China prevented the use of exchange rates and currency
reserves as indicators.

not going to make it easier to reach concrete steps that can
bring effective solutions to the global imbalances.""	
 ""The traditional issues are still there: the United States
wants China to have a stronger exchange rate and more domestic
demand,"" he said, ""And China wants to support exports via a weak
exchange rate and, because it has weaker banks than some
countries, doesn't want to open up its capital account.""	
 
 ECONOMIC CHANGES MAY EASE PRESSURE	
 France, which chairs the Group of 20 this year, has said it
aims to reach an agreement on the next step in the process -- a
set of ""indicative guidelines"" for using the indicators -- at a
G20 finance ministers meeting in mid-April in Washington.	
 Saturday's communique said the guidelines would take into
account specific circumstances, like commodities producers such
as Saudi Arabia with large trade surpluses. It also stated that
these guidelines would not be ""targets.""	
 Despite such caveats, members countries were quick to
establish their red lines. Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister
of world No. 2 exporter Germany, said after talks ended that
there would be no numerical targets on some indicators.	
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the tense
talks reflected the resurgence of national interests in the wake
of the crisis -- undermining the G20 two years after it helped
broker a deal to pull the world economic back from the brink.	
 ""What I was worried about, I'm sorry to say, materialized,
which is that it's more difficult than before to have people
agree,"" he said. ""Our task to reach this consensus was not even
that difficult.""	
 France's attempts to gradually draw China into a dialogue on
its currency met with scant success. Central Bank Governor Zhou
Xiaochuan said China would not be pushed into faster yuan
appreciation, nor did Beijing offer more flexibility to win a
place for the yuan in the basket of currencies backing the IMF's
Special Drawing Right assets, as France has suggested.	
 But China did agree to host a seminar on reform of the
international monetary system in Shenzhen in late March, with
the involvement of the central bank and foreign ministry.	
 Barclays' Ricci said that in the wake of the crisis tensions
over global imbalances may ease as the U.S. Federal Reserve
winds down its quantitative easing, relieving some pressures on
prices and exchange rates in emerging countries.	
 The absence of cheap money could also remind Washington that
it needs China's savings to help fund its large deficit.	
 ""If, as we expect, emerging market countries including China
also gradually increase their domestic demand then the issue of
global imbalances will become less pressing,"" Ricci said.	
 ""The G20 has a role to play in bringing countries together
for discussions, but I would not focus just on these economic
indicators. Financial sector reform is an area where it has made
a lot of progress and there is probably a lot more to come.""

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Feb. 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped a dollar
and Asian stocks slipped on Monday as spreading tensions in
Libya and other oil-producing regions encouraged some profit
taking after last week's solid gains.	
 Brent crude oil futures and U.S. crude futures
both vaulted around $1/bbl to $103.50 and $87.31 per
barrel respectively, while gold prices inched higher,
adding to last week's gains of nearly 3 percent.	
 Anti-government protesters rallied in Tripoli's streets at
the weekend, tribal leaders spoke out against leader Muammar
Gaddafi, and army units defected to the opposition as oil
exporter Libya endured one of the bloodiest revolts to convulse
the Arab world. 
 Beijing's latest move to tighten policy in the form of
banks' required reserve increases saw Shanghai and Hong
Kong stocks take a tumble with lenders leading declines.
.	
 The MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
eased by 0.3 percent after advancing 2.5 percent
last week, its best weekly performance in two months.	
 ""There are few buying or selling cues in the domestic
market. Investors will likely stay alert to geopolitical news
that could affect markets across the world,"" said Hikaru Sato, a
senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Market.	
 ""The Middle East continues to be a focus, while there are
concerns about China.""	
 While some stock markets across the region have somewhat
recovered after a sharp selloff in the opening weeks of 2011,
analysts say selling pressure may intensify if tensions in the
Middle East escalate further.	
 Asia-ex Japan equity funds saw the biggest weekly outflows
in the second week of February since the first quarter of 2008,
data from fund tracker EPFR Global showed.	
 Moreover, concerns that a breathtaking rally in U.S. stocks
in recent weeks, which has boosted the region's developed
markets such as Australia and Tokyo may be
nearing a close, also weighed on sentiment.	
 U.S. markets are shut on Monday for a public holiday.	
 China's benchmark short-term money market rate
soared more than 300 basis points on Monday after Beijing on
Friday raised required reserves for banks by 50 basis points to
a record 19.5 percent. .	
 
 FX VIEW BRIGHTENS	
 The foggy outlook for equities in the near term is in sharp
contrast to the view emerging in the region's currency markets,
where analysts are calling for more gains.	
 Barring the baht, yen and the rupee, all other Asian
currencies have posted substantial gains so far this year,
indicating authorities are allowing more currency strength to
tackle inflation.	
 A monthly Reuters poll showed investors increased their long
positions on the Indonesian rupiah, Singapore dollar, Philippine
peso and the Chinese yuan while Standard Chartered strategists
recommended overweight bets on Asian currencies.
.	
 China's move to nudge the yuan's daily mid-point
fixings higher recently has also fueled gains.	
 Elsewhere, the euro held firm after comments from a
European Central Bank official kept alive the prospects for the
ECB to hike rates before the Fed, while the Aussie was
resilient in the face of China's latest policy move.	
 The common currency last traded near $1.3700 , having
briefly risen to around $1.3727 with trading likely confined to
ranges due to the U.S. holiday on Monday. 
 The G20 meeting's outcome had little impact on markets after
policymakers reached a fudged accord on how to measure
imbalances in the global economy after China prevented the use
of exchange rates and currency reserves as indicators.
.	
 Meanwhile, spreading unrest in North Africa and the Middle
East continued to push commodities and precious metals higher.

(Adds government comment)
 By Omar Valdimarsson
 REYKJAVIK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Iceland's president on Sunday
triggered a referendum on an updated plan to repay $5 billion to
Britain and the Netherlands for debts incurred in the financial
crisis, renewing uncertainty over economic recovery.
 Iceland, where the economy and financial system crashed in
late 2008, owes Britain and the Netherlands money they used to
bail out domestic savers who lost money in online ""Icesave""
accounts run by a failed Icelandic bank.
 Icelandic President Olafur Grimsson said the new terms
thrashed out over months of negotiation were better than the
first deal, rejected by Icelanders last year. 
 However, he said it was fundamental ""the people exercised
legislative power in the Icesave dispute"".
 ""I have, therefore, decided in accordance with Article 26 of
the constitution, to refer the new bill to a referendum.""
 Icelandic Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson said the
government would not resign.
 ""There is no reason for that,"" he said. ""If the agreement is
defeated in the referendum, we will address that question.""
 A referendum will be held as soon as possible but will not
take place for at least a month.
 Resolving the Icesave dispute has long been seen as
necessary for Iceland's plan to join the European Union and for
getting the economy back on its feet.
 The government wants a deal, but there is deep resentment on
the island. Many Icelanders believe it is unfair that taxpayers
must foot the bill for mistakes made by private banks. 
 The Dutch government said the time had passed for talks over
Iceland's debts.
 ""We have passed the stage of negotiations, but it is not up
to us how this situation in Iceland will advance. We are sure
the Icelandic government will consider the new situation and we
hope to hear from them soon,"" Dutch Finance Ministry spokesman
Niels Redeker said.
 A British Treasury spokesman said: ""We have noted the
decision of the Icelandic president. We look forward to
clarification of the Icelandic position in the coming days.""
 
 COLLAPSE
 Iceland's financial meltdown caused the crown currency to
collapse and sent the economy into a tailspin. The country had
to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund and others. 
 Strict capital controls were slapped in place to prevent an
outflow of funds, keeping Iceland cut off from international
capital markets and stunting its recovery.
 Things have slowly been returning to normal. Interest rates
have dropped from around 18 percent to 4.25 percent currently
and inflation is under control. The country has taken steps to
recapitalise its banking system and the central bank has been
mulling its first international debt issue since the crisis.
 The economy should grow this year for the first time since
2008.
 The Icesave bill was supposed to be another step towards
normalisation.
 Should Icelanders reject the plan, however, progress on EU
membership and ending capital controls -- key to restarting the
flow of foreign investment -- will be more difficult.
 Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir said she was concerned
that repayment terms could now be set by European authorities
who would step in if the three parties cannot agree.
 The government has said the ultimate cost for Iceland under
the current Icesave bill was likely to be no more than 50
billion crowns ($425 million), with Landsbanki assets covering
the rest. The EU could set tougher terms.
 Grimsson's veto was the second time he has rejected an
Icesave repayment bill. 
 In a March 2010 referendum, an overwhelming majority of the
country's roughly 200,000 voters threw out an earlier payment
plan, sending negotiations between the three countries back to
square one and delaying economic recovery.
 A total of 44 members of the 63-seat parliament backed the
new repayment plan earlier this week.

 * C.bank says will provide all support to banks if needed
 (Adds quotes, background)
 DUBAI, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Bahrain's banking system is
operating normally and economic fundamentals remain strong
despite civil unrest, the central bank said, adding it would
provide all necessary support to banks if needed.
 Political protests in the small non-OPEC oil producer,
inspired by popular revolts that toppled leaders in Egypt and
Tunisia, have shaken the Gulf Arab island kingdom and sent
default protection costs up over the past week.
 ""All financial transactions are at the normal level and the
dinar continues to trade at the same level,"" the central bank
said in a statement on Sunday after a meeting with retail banks
heads.
 Bahrain like most Gulf Arab oil producers links its dinar to
the U.S. dollar with the peg set at 0.376.
 The peg limits flexibility of Bahrain's monetary policy as
the central bank needs to keep interest rates close to U.S.
benchmarks to avoid excessive pressures on its currency.
 Central Bank Governor Rasheed al-Maraj also assured bankers
on Sunday that the monetary authority would continue to
cooperate and support banks and provide all necessary support to
facilitate banking operations, the statement said.
 ""It is normal following any political or economic
development that the credit rating agencies would review the
ratings,"" Maraj said.
 ""However, we believe that the economic fundamentals of the
Kingdom of Bahrain remain strong and that the short term
economic and political developments should not entirely reflect
on the review,"" he said.
 Moody's, which downgraded Bahrain's sovereign rating last
year, said on Sunday it was concerned about continuing unrest in
Bahrain and was monitoring the situation closely 
 Last week, Fitch Ratings warned it may downgrade Bahrain's
credit ratings in the next few months as anti-government
protests escalate.
 Thousands of Bahraini protesters set up a tent city in a
Manama square that has come to symbolise their cause on Sunday,
some calling for immediate political change and others hoping
for talks to resolve the crisis.
 The cost of insuring Bahrain's debt rose to its highest
level since August 2009 on Friday with five-year credit default
swaps (CDS) quoted at 310 basis points after closing at 261
points on Thursday.

 * Investors demand exchange remain shut till country stable
 * Demand that trades made on Jan. 26 and 27 be cancelled
 
 By Ehab Farouk 
 CAIRO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Around 100 investors demonstrated
in front of the Cairo stock exchange on Sunday to demand the
cancellation of trades they made last month when political
protests caused the market to plummet.
 The exchange's chairman, Khaled Serry Seyam, told a group of
the investors that no decision on the trades would be taken
until the public prosecutor had investigated them, one of the
investors said.
 Seyam told 15 of the investors whom he invited to his office
that a list of trades made during the two days when the market
was open after the protests erupted had been sent to the public
prosecutor, according to Mustafa Eisa, a former assessor at
accounting firm KPMG Hazem Hassan, who was one of the investors
to whom Seyam spoke.
 Stock exchange officials were not immediately available to
comment.
 Many brokers and investors were badly caught out by the fall
in share prices.
 The stock market's benchmark index fell 6.1 percent on
Wednesday Jan. 26 and another 10.5 percent the day after, the
only two sessions when the exchange was open after the protests
broke out on Jan. 25.
On Sunday the demonstrators demanded that the bourse, closed
for three weeks because of the unrest that toppled Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, remain shut until the country's
situation stabilises.
 They also accused businessmen close to the government of
Mubarak of having manipulated the market.
Egypt's banks reopened on Sunday after being closed most of
last week when workers went on strike. Stock market officials
say they will reopen the bourse once they are sure the banks are
functioning properly.
 ""Why all this haste to open the market now? The time is not
right,"" said Eisa.
 ""The country has no president, no constitution and no
parliament. How can you open a stock market in such
circumstances?""
 Mohamed Abdel Salam, deputy chairman of the stock exchange's
Clearing Settlement and Central Depositary, said last week the
exchange had no intention of cancelling trades despite requests
by many investors that it do so. 
 The protesting investors fixed posters on the walls of the
stock exchange building demanding that Seyam and of the chairman
of Egypt's financial regulatory authority Ziad Bahaa el-Din both
resign.
 The market regulator said last week that once the exchange
does reopen it will suspend trade for a half hour if its broad
100-share index declines by 5 percent and for even longer if it
falls by 10 percent.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Investors may start to see
warning signs soon as their allocations into risky assets move
to extremes only half way into the first quarter, while earnings
and inflation-related risks are mounting.
 Inflation, indeed, is taking centre stage at the Paris
meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs, who are expected to make
only glacial progress on an ambitious agenda including proposals
to curb the volatility of food and fuel prices.
 World stocks, as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>, have
raced to 30-month highs in the past week. The index has already
gained more than 5 percent this year, more than half of last
year's total gains.
 The flow of money into U.S. equity markets is gathering
pace. According to Thomson Reuters Lipper data, investors put a
net $9.45 billion into U.S. equity mutual funds in the week
ended Feb. 16, the highest since mid-June and four times the
prior week's inflows.
 ""It's a typical beginning of the year rotation where
investors are taking profit on last year's winners and chasing
laggards,"" said Didier Saint-Georges, a member of the investment
committee at private asset manager Carmignac Gestion in Paris.
 Emerging stocks have turned lower so far this year with a
loss of nearly 3 percent year to date <.MSCIEF>, having risen 16
percent last year.
 ""It doesn't take into account risks hovering over the euro
zone sovereign debt problem and related risk on the banks. In
the short term there's a money flow that could reverse,"" he
said.
 The euro zone sovereign debt crisis certainly is lingering,
with banks tapping the European Central Bank for an unusually
high amount of emergency overnight borrowing in the past week.
 ECB figures showed on Friday banks borrowed more than 16
billion euros in costly overnight funding -- the highest since
June 2009, on top of Thursday's 15 billion euros. The sum
compared with 1.2 billion euros borrowed earlier in the week.
 This is fanning fears that a euro zone bank could be facing
serious funding problems.
 Ireland goes to the polls on Feb. 25 in the first general
election since the debt crisis. German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's party also faces a series of possible defeats in seven
state elections, starting with Hamburg on Feb. 20.
 ""This could further limit her room for manoeuvre in EU
fiscal matters,"" BNP Paribas said in a note to clients.
 
 AMBER LIGHTS
 Euro zone business and consumer sentiment indicators are due
in the coming week, while many European financial companies,
including Commerzbank , Royal Bank of Scotland ,
Allianz  and Credit Agricole , report their
results.
According to Thomson Reuters data, financial companies on
the European benchmark DJ STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> have so far
reported earnings that are 8.3 percent below their estimates.
 Five out of 10 equity sectors in the DJ STOXX 600 index
reported earnings that are below estimates. Overall, however,
actual earnings are 4.4 percent higher than the estimates.
 The monthly fund managers survey from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch showed average cash holdings fell to 3.5 percent
in February from 3.7 percent, a level that the bank views as an
equity sell signal.
 In the past, investors have sold stocks in subsequent weeks
five out of seven times when cash was at this level.
 ""From the technical and policy view there are some amber
warning lights,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy
at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh.
 ""Looking ahead, I am a little concerned. All the good
earnings news is by and large over.""
 And finally, investors will be monitoring the impact of
political turmoil in the Middle East, which helped push the
region's debt insurance costs across the board and lifted London
crude oil prices to 2-1/2 year highs above $104 a barrel 
in the past week.
 The cost of insuring Bahrain's sovereign debt against
default for five years hit fresh 18-month highs as thousands
gathered to bury protestors killed in a crackdown against
anti-government protestors this week.

 * Unemployment rate at 0.6 percent
 
 (Adds analyst comment, background)
 DUBAI, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Dubai's economy grew 2.5 percent
in the first nine months of 2010, compared with the same period
of the previous year, as trade and retail picked up, the head of
the Gulf Arab emirate's statistics office said on Sunday.
 Dubai's debt woes, prompted by the plunge of its property
sector, weighed on economic performance across the United Arab
Emirates in 2010 as many of the OPEC member's banks were exposed
to state-owned developers that ran into trouble.
 But rising trade flows helped fuel economic recovery.
 Arif Obaid al-Muhairi, Executive Director at the Dubai
Statistics Center, said that wholesale and retail sectors were
the main growth drivers, the website www.dsc.gov.ae showed.
 He did not say whether the gross domestic product increase
was in real or nominal terms.
 Last October, Muhairi saw Dubai's GDP growth at 2.3 percent
in 2010, well above a 0.5 percent forecast by the International
Monetary Fund.
 The economy of the emirate, which accounts for some 80
percent of the UAE non-oil trade, expanded 5.7 percent in real
terms in 2008. Official 2009 GDP data for Dubai are not
available, although the IMF estimated a 0.9 percent contraction.
 Muhairi said on Sunday that transport, storage and
telecommunications were the second largest sectors in terms of
2010 growth, up an average of 10 percent in the same period.
 The Dubai economy -- which accounts for almost a third of
the seven-member UAE federation -- saw a slight drop in
construction and real estate sectors, while the average jobless
rate stood at 0.6 percent, he said.
 ""The first half, maybe the first quarter 2009 was the period
when economic activity dipped. Since then there has been a
rebound,"" said Giyas Gokkent, chief economist at the National
Bank of Abu Dhabi.
 ""You can see that for example in the trade data and ... you
can also see it when you look at anecdotal evidence in sales
activity,"" he said.
 Trade activity in Dubai, a key trade and tourism gateway to
the UAE, has picked up strongly last year with third quarter
exports and re-exports up 35 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, from the previous year.
 Passenger traffic at Dubai's international airport jumped 15
percent in 2010, while hotel occupancy was up 3.8 percent in
January-September.
 Concerns about Dubai's total liabilities, estimated at
around $115 billion or some 123 percent of GDP, have eased after
state-owned Dubai World sealed a deal last September to
restructure almost $25 billion of debt.
 But worries still persist about the ability of Dubai and its
companies to repay bonds and loans worth billions of dollars in
the next four years as the emirate lacks the oil wealth of
neighbouring Abu Dhabi.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2011 08:00AM ET</span>",UK's Osborne-BoE credibility is not under threat," By Fiona Shaikh
 PARIS, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Britain has no plans to alter the
Bank of England's inflation-fighting remit and Governor Mervyn
King's support of fiscal tightening has not harmed the central
bank's credibility, finance minister George Osborne said.
 Surging oil and commodity prices combined with this year's
rise in value added tax propelled British inflation to 4 percent
in January -- double the BoE's target -- but the Bank does not
seem in any hurry to raise rates from the current 0.5 percent.
 Indeed, inflation in Britain has been above target for most
of the last five years, leading some economists to question the
BoE's inflation-fighting zeal and the validity of the consumer
price inflation target.
 Last week's inflation data obliged King to write an
explanatory letter to the government -- his tenth in almost four
years -- but Osborne said he saw no case for altering the 2
percent target.
 ""I think the inflation regime, the remit, is the correct
one. I've got absolutely no thoughts or plans about changing
it,"" Osborne told reporters after a meeting of G20 finance
ministers in Paris at the weekend.
 ""And as my exchange of letters with the Governor confirmed,
I'm happy with the approach they're taking and I trust the
judgement of the Monetary Policy Committee.""
 
 BALANCING ACT
 BoE policymakers face the dilemma of how to bring inflation
back on track over the medium term without throwing the fragile
economic recovery off course.
 Their job has been complicated by the goverment's rise in
VAT, which is likely to propel inflation to almost 5 percent in
the coming months, while public spending cuts that will start to
take effect this year are likely to dampen economic growth.
 Osborne batted away criticism that the government's
austerity measures were making the BoE's task more difficult and
said the cuts would give the central bank ""space"" to keep
interest rates lower for longer.
 ""Any monetary authority with the competence of the Bank of
England can see through temporary increases in price levels and
look to permanent threats to inflation,"" he said.
 Indeed, BoE forecasts published last week showed it expects
inflation to fall to below target at the two-year horizon on
which it bases monetary policy decisions, on the assumption that
interest rates rise gradually this year.
 At the same time, King repeated his support for the
government's austerity measures, saying it needed a ""Plan A"" for
reducing a record peacetime deficit, and drawing a rare attack
from Labour finance spokesman Ed Balls who accused him of
putting the BoE's independence at risk.
 Osborne said Balls' attack was ""flimsy"" and ""immature"".
 ""I think the Bank of England has credibility. I certainly
have complete confidence in it. I don't think it's being
political or partisan,"" he said.
 ""What I think is important is that the British government
does its job correctly, which is to get a control of fiscal
policy and put in place the long-term changes to improve our
economy and the short term improvements we can make as well. And
the Bank of England does its job -- which I think it's doing
competently -- which is to meet its inflation mandate. That's
how we divide up the responsibilities.""

banks in the Zamalek district of the city were operating
normally, Reuters witnesses said.
 There were no signs of the worker protests outside the main

 * China prevents exchange rate and reserves criteria

(Adds debate on indicators, growth, inflation)
 By Louise Egan and Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Finance ministers of the world's
major economies reached a fudged accord on Saturday on how to
measure imbalances in the global economy after China prevented
the use of exchange rates and currency reserves as indicators.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who chaired the
Group of 20 talks, said the deal nevertheless represented a
significant step towards better coordination of economic
policies worldwide to help prevent another financial crisis.
 ""It wasn't simple. There were obviously divergent interests
but we were able to reach a compromise on a text that seems to
us to be both balanced and demanding in its implementation,"" she
told a news conference.
 Ministers and central bank governors agreed on a list of
indicators including public debt and fiscal deficits, private
savings and borrowing, the trade balance and other components of
balance of payments such as net investment flows.
 But at Chinese insistence there was no mention of the real
effective exchange rate or of foreign currency reserves.
 ""Reserves have been dropped,"" Lagarde acknowledged, adding
that the deal included a mechanism to take account of exchange
rates when assessing the overall balance of payments.
 The United States and other western countries accuse Beijing
of keeping the yuan artificially undervalued to boost its
exports, hence accumulating massive foreign currency reserves
that they say distort the world economy.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner repeated after the
talks that China's currency ""remains substantially undervalued""
and its real exchange rate had not moved much despite a slow
appreciation since a reform last June.
 ""There is broad consensus that the major economies, not just
Europe, Japan and the United States but also the large emerging
economies, need to allow their exchange rates to adjust in
response to market forces,"" he said.
 The world's number two economy, which overtook Japan this
week, has resisted Western pressure to substantially revalue its
currency to help rebalance global growth.
 China's trade surplus has shrunk of late, perhaps explaining
why it prefers that measure.
 Western and Japanese officials said the indicators would in
practice cover balance of payments and foreign reserves, even if
those terms had been omitted to assuage Beijing. Chinese Finance
Minister Xie Xuren left without speaking to reporters.
 ""We needed to be inventive about wording in the communique
in consideration for a country that did not want to use the term
'current account balance'... The statement lists components of
the current account balance,"" Japanese Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda told reporters.
 
 NO SPECIFIC GOALS
 Lagarde said the indicators were not binding targets but
would lead to the drafting of guidelines for coordinated
economic policies to reduce distortions, and then to a mutual
assessment process.
 Germany, Europe's biggest exporter, which has resisted U.S.
efforts to set numerical targets for current account surpluses,
said no specific goals would be set for certain indicators.
 The G20 ministers acknowledged that economic recovery was
diverging between developed and developing economies, but they
differed in their assessment of global inflation risks.
 The communique noted that while growth was subdued in most
developed economies, with unemployment high, major emerging
markets were roaring ahead, ""some with signs of overheating"".
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
inflationary pressures coming from energy and commodities prices
must be taken seriously, and the ECB was determined to avoid
second-round effects on wages.
 But Geithner said inflation risks in the United States were
moderate.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the G20
presidency this year, urged ministers on Friday not to get
bogged down by the indicators dispute and welcomed the fact that
China had agreed to host a seminar on reforming the
international monetary system in Shenzhen in late March.
 France has also run into opposition with its two other G20
priorities -- greater transparency and regulation of commodities
prices and reform of the international monetary system.
 The G20 communique said ministers agreed to work on
strengthening the international monetary system to help avoid
disruptive fluctuations in capital flows and disorderly
movements in exchange rates.
 China and Brazil complain that ""hot money"" inflows risk
destabilising the economies of emerging countries, pointing the
finger at the U.S. Federal Reserve's money printing via a $600
billion bond purchase programme.
 With world shares at 30-month highs, investors seem content
for the G20 to take its time, whereas at the height of the
crisis two years ago markets were baying for policy action.

 * Trichet should have full support of colleagues until Oct
 * Competitiveness is key to growth in euro zone
 * Greece must fully meet EU fiscal plan to restore trust
 
 (Adds quotes, background)
 ATHENS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Automatic sanctions to discipline
fiscal offenders in the euro zone are preferable to setting
constitutional debt brakes, ECB Governing Council member Yves
Mersch told Greek newspaper Real News on Saturday.
 Writing debt limits into national laws is part of a
controversial six-point plan put forward by Germany to boost
economic coordination in the euro zone as the bloc zeroes in on
a comprehensive package to solve its sovereign debt crisis.
 ""It would be preferable to put more emphasis on automatic
sanctions to achieve the Maastricht criteria instead of being
led to an intergovernmental accord to change the constitution of
every country, which could prove even more slow (to reach) than
even a treaty,"" Mersch, Luxembourg's central banker, told the
paper in an interview.
 He said the euro zone was not facing a crisis of the euro as
a currency but a fiscal crisis in several countries which needed
to take tough measures to tackle their problems.
 ""There is no crisis of the euro as a currency. In the last
12 years the euro gained more value than any other currency in
the last 50 years,"" Mersch said.
 ""What we are going through now is a crisis in the public
finances of several countries. But this in no way sets at risk
the viability of the euro zone.""
 Mersch said macroeconomic imbalalances should be avoided and
corrected at an early stage and that usage of the European
financial stability mechanism should be flexible.
 He told the paper European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet should have the full support of his
colleagues until his term ends in October.
 ""The president of the ECB will be in his position until the
end of October. Until then and amidst such critical conditions
he needs allies and the maximum support from all his colleagues
despite talk of his likely successor,"" Mersch said.
 He said improving competitiveness was key to boosting growth
in the 17-country bloc and that some countries needed to tidy up
their banking systems to have healthy balance sheets and
efficient risk management.
 Commenting on Greece, which is struggling to emerge from a
severe debt crisis, Mersch said progress in slashing deficits so
far was impressive given the adverse macroeconomic conditions.
 ""In the future, it is particularly crucial that Greece fully
complies with the fiscal adjustment plan. This is something that
will bring back credibility and trust in Greece,"" he said.

the need to combat exchange rate volatility and misalignment but
dropped a previous appeal against competitive devaluations in a
communique published after talks on Saturday.
 The communique said G20 countries were committed to enhanced
exchange rate flexibility and that the international monetary
system should be improved to avoid disruptive swings in capital
flows and exchange rates. [ID:nLDE71I0FN] 
 It was issued after the first major G20 meeting under French
chairmanship, where China resisted attempts to make exchange
rates one of a set of indicators to be used to measure economic
imbalances. [ID:nLDE71I02C] 
 ""There was no indication by China that they intended to be
more flexible with respect to their currency immediately,"" said
Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. ""But ... this isn't just
about exchange rates. This is about growing global imbalances.""
 As often happens at such meetings, what G20 countries cannot
collectively agree to put in their joint communique gets said at
news conferences.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner repeated
Washington's complaint about China's currency.
 ""China's currency remains substantially undervalued, and its
real effective exchange rate -- the best measure to judge its
currency against all of its trading partners -- has not moved
much in this latest period of exchange rate reform,"" he said.
 A meeting of G20 finance ministers in Gyeongju, South Korea,
last Oct. 23, went somewhat further in its encouragement of
exchange rate flexibility -- decrying competitive currency
devaluations -- although it did not explicitly mention China by
name.
 France, which is pressing in more general terms for a reform
of a dollar-dominated global monetary order over the longer term
announced during the Paris talks that China had agreed to hold a
seminar on the issue in the last three days of March, in the
coastal city of Shenzhen.
 Following is what Saturday's communique said about exchange
rates compared with the statement from the G20 finance
ministers' last meeting in October in South Korea:
 
 PARIS COMMUNIQUE EXCERPTS:
 ""Our main priority actions include implementing medium term
fiscal consolidation plans differentiated according to national
circumstances in line with our Toronto commitment, pursuing
appropriate monetary policy, enhancing exchange rate flexibility
to better reflect underlying economic fundamentals and
structural reforms, to sustain global demand, increase potential
growth, foster job creation and contribute to global
rebalancing.
 The international monetary system (IMS) has proven
resilient, but vulnerabilities remain, which raise the need to
improve it in order to ensure systemic stability, promote
orderly adjustment, and avoid disruptive fluctuations in capital
flows, disorderly movements in exchange rates -- including
advanced economies with reserve currencies being vigilant
against excess volatility -- and persistent misalignment of
exchange rates. Today we agreed on a work program aimed at
strengthening the functioning of the IMS, including through
coherent approaches and measures to deal with potentially
destabilizing capital flows, among which macro-prudential
measures, mindful of possible drawbacks; and management of
global liquidity to strengthen our capacity to prevent and deal
with shocks, including issues such as Financial Safety Nets and
the role of the SDR.""
 
 GYEONGJU COMMUNIQUE EXCERPTS:
 ""We are mindful of the risks of synchronized adjustment on
the global recovery and of the risks that failure to implement
consolidation, where immediately necessary, would undermine
confidence and growth;
 - continue with monetary policy which is appropriate to
achieve price stability and thereby contributes to the recovery;
- move towards more market determined exchange rate systems
that reflect underlying economic fundamentals and refrain from
competitive devaluation of currencies.
 Advanced economies, including those with reserve currencies,
will be vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly
movements in exchange rates.
 These actions will help mitigate the risk of excessive
volatility in capital flows facing some emerging countries.""

 (Recasts first paragraph, adds quotes, background)
 By Glenn Somerville
 PARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner on Saturday pointed to the problems China's tightly
controlled currency poses for other developing economies and
said Beijing still had further to go to let its currency rise.
 Talks at a Group of 20 meeting in Paris centred round
efforts, led by Germany and G20 presidents France, to persuade
China to include its yawning current account surplus and
undervalued currency in a list of measures aimed to start a
process of rebalancing the global economy.
 There was little public evidence that the United States
itself had pushed Beijing hard on that issue, but Geithner
reiterated that there was still some way to go in the steady
appreciation of the yuan.
 ""China's currency remains substantially undervalued, and its
real effective exchange rate -- the best measure to judge its
currency against all of its trading partners -- has not moved
much in this latest period of exchange-rate reform,"" Geithner
told a press conference after the meeting.
 China stuck to its guns, saying currency reform was a matter
for internal discussion; the final G20 communique made no
mention of foreign currency reserves and included softened
references to exchange rates and the current account. 
 That came after ""frank, sometimes tense"" negotiations over a
set of indicators for gauging economic imbalances and suggested
more progress will not be easy on an issue western governments
hope will allow them to put more pressure on Beijing.
 Geithner cast the issue as part of a broader problem faced
by countries like Brazil, which has a flexible exchange rate but
must deal with large capital inflows that push its currency up
and create inflationary pressures. 
 Normally the response to such inflation would be to hike
interest rates but that might draw even more capital and
Brazilian officials at the meeting said the problem was about
both China and other Asian economies.
 ""All Asian countries need to stop devaluating their
currencies, it is a set of responsibilities, it is not just
China,"" Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said on Friday.
 
 COMPROMISE
 Geithner offered reassuring words about the U.S. economy,
saying that growth was ""gathering momentum"" and said European
leaders had told G20 peers that they would ensure that
struggling euro zone nations and their banks would have access
to financing.
 China is now the world's second largest economy, but still a
fast-growing emerging market and Geithner said stronger
standards for appropriate foreign exchange policies would ""help
accommodate the changes in economic forces ahead"".
 The G20 gathering, chaired by French Finance Minister
Christine Lagarde, did agree on a list of indicators that could
be used to gauge economic imbalances but it was a compromise
that fudged the reference to currency values.
 The final list included public debts and fiscal deficits,
private savings and private debt, the trade balance and other
components of the balance of payments such as net investment
flows. It said only that exchange rates would be given ""due
consideration"".
 Geithner said the G20 was moving gradually toward a pact on
how to identify and resolve imbalances, driven by a wish to
avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis that struck in
2008, but said it will take time to do so.
 In response to questions, he played down the significance of
not including excess reserves as one measure of imbalances,
given that China has the world's largest reserves of foreign
currency.
 ""The question of reserves is not really critical at this
stage,"" Geithner said. ""You have to take into account broader
sensitivities and how to deal with the challenges of excess
reserves and it may take a little bit more time to work
through.""

 By Gernot Heller and Francesca Landini
 PARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - China was holding out on Saturday
against an agreement among the world's major economies on ways
to measure and correct global economic imbalances, refusing to
have its massive currency reserves used as an indicator.
 Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 20
countries were struggling to agree on a set of yardsticks to
identify problems that could cause another global financial
crisis after senior officials failed to achieve a breakthrough
in an all-night negotiating session, delegates said.
 China continued to reject attempts to use real effective
exchange rates and currency reserves to measure imbalances and
wanted trade figures rather than current account balances used
to assess economic distortions.
 ""China and Brazil are objecting, including on real exchange
rates. Some countries do not want the words exchange rate
included in the set of indicators. This is why the talks are
blocked,"" Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said.
 A senior G20 official said French Economy Minister Christine
Lagarge, chairing the talks, was leaving the indicators issue
until the final session in hopes of clinching a last-minute
compromise.
 ""It is looking bleak as of now, the negotiations have turned
quite political,"" another senior G20 source said. ""But I'm not
saying it's a dead end. Ministers want to put something in the
communique.""
 The world's number two economy, which overtook Japan this
week, has resisted Western pressure to substantially revalue its
currency to help rebalance global growth.
 Germany held out hope for a deal despite the Chinese stance.
 ""I think we will reach agreement today on which indicators
we (use to) measure imbalances in the future, to fight timely
mis-developments, to come to a balanced growth,"" German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters.
 The main developed and emerging economies have agreed on
some key indicators, such as government debts and deficits,
consumer borrowing and private savings.
 But failure to agree even on how to measure mismatches in
the world economy would augur badly for the G20 process, charged
with finding ways of coordinating global economic policies to
smooth out distortions before they trigger future crises.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the G20
presidency this year, urged ministers on Friday not to get
sidetracked by the indicators dispute and welcomed the fact that
China had agreed to host a seminar on reforming the
international monetary system in Shenzhen in late March.
 ""I want to avoid your debates getting bogged down in
interminable discussion about these indicators, which are
distracting us from the essentials,"" Sarkozy said in a speech.
 He said a joint approach was the only way forward. ""Giving
priority to national interests would be the death of the G20,""
he said.
 
 COMPROMISE?
 Even if all the yardsticks are agreed, there is no sign of
numerical targets even being broached.
 ""Until April in Washington the process of implementation of
indicators will be talked about,"" Schaeuble said.
 France has also run into opposition with its two other G20
priorities -- greater transparency and regulation of commodities
prices and reform of the international monetary system.
 On Friday, ministers said there was broad agreement over two
indicators measuring public and private debt but France, and
most of the group, wants a full slate covering not just those
areas but the current account, the real effective exchange rate
and currency reserves as well.
 China's trade surplus has shrunk of late, perhaps explaining
why it prefers that measure.
 It has consistently pushed back against U.S. pressure to
allow its yuan currency to revalue more quickly and complains
that ""hot money"" risks destabilising its economy, pointing the
finger at the Federal Reserve's money printing via a $600
billion bond purchase programme.
 One option mooted on Friday was to allow China to opt out of
the balance of payments criterion and use its trade balance
instead. But two G20 sources said an opt-out was a non-starter.
 China's opposition left G20 deputies -- the experts who
negotiate on details -- with limited options to propose: either
accept all the indicators or reject them; introduce a hierarchy
where some indicators count more than others or use a time delay
for their gradual introduction.
 But some delegates said there was doubt whether the Chinese
delegation, led by finance minister Xie Xuren, was empowered to
compromise.
 With world shares at 30-month highs, investors seem content
for the G20 to take its time, whereas at the height of the
crisis two years ago markets were baying for policy action.

 * German finance minister says deal still possible
 * Negotiators stymied after all-night talks
 * G20 official says China alone in its opposition
 
 By Gernot Heller
 PARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Germany held out hope on Saturday
for a G20 deal on measuring global economic imbalances despite
stiff Chinese opposition to some of the indicators proposed.
 China rejected plans on Friday to use real exchange rates
and currency reserves to measure imbalances and said trade
figures rather than current account balances should be used to
assess economic distortions.
 A failure to agree even on how to measure mismatches in the
world economy would augur badly for the G20 process, charged
with finding ways to avoid future economic crises.
 Late on Friday, after many hours of tortuous negotiation,
officials struck an uncertain tone.
 ""I cannot tell you what will happen tomorrow. Nobody knows,""
one G20 official said, adding that China was the only country
which came out against accepting the list of indicators.
 A senior G20 source said on Saturday that negotiators had
worked all night but failed to make any breakthrough.
 But as ministers from the world's most powerful economies
prepared to get down to work, German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said they had a ""good chance"" of breaking the
deadlock.
 ""I think we will reach agreement today on which indicators
we (use to) measure imbalances in the future, to fight timely
mis-developments, to come to a balanced growth,"" Schaeuble told
reporters.
 The hardline Chinese stance highlighted splits over how to
define economic imbalances and prescribe action to remedy them,
a key aim of France's G20 presidency.
 Two other G20 sources said negotiators had failed to reach
agreement and would leave it up to their finance ministers to
try and seal a deal on specifics on Saturday.
 Even then, agreement was uncertain, they said.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the G20
presidency this year, urged ministers on Friday not to get
sidetracked by the indicators dispute and welcomed the fact that
China had agreed to host a G20 seminar on reforming the
international monetary system in Shenzhen in late March.
 ""I want to avoid your debates getting bogged down in
interminable discussion about these indicators, which are
distracting us from the essentials,"" Sarkozy said in a speech.
 He said a joint approach was the only way forward. ""Giving
priority to national interests would be the death of the G20,""
he said.
 Even if all the yardsticks are agreed, there is no sign of
numerical targets even being broached.
 ""Until April in Washington the process of implementation of
indicators will be talked about,"" Schaeuble said.
 France has also run into opposition with its two other G20
priorities -- greater transparency and regulation of commodities
prices and reform of the international monetary system.
 
 COMPROMISE?
 On Friday, ministers said there was broad agreement over two
indicators measuring public and private debt but France, and
most of the group, wants a full slate covering not just those
areas but the current account, the real effective exchange rate
and currency reserves as well.
 China's trade surplus has shrunk of late, perhaps explaining
why it prefers that measure.
 It has consistently pushed back against U.S. pressure to
allow its yuan currency to revalue more quickly.
 Beijing has already raised interest rates to combat
inflation and complains that ""hot money"" risks destabilising its
economy, pointing the finger at the Federal Reserve's money
printing via a $600 billion bond purchase programme.
 One option mooted on Friday was to allow China to opt out of
the balance of payments criterion and use its trade balance
instead.
 But the two G20 sources said an opt-out was a non-starter.
 The G20 official said China's opposition left G20 deputies
-- the experts who do the nitty-gritty negotiating -- with
limited options to propose: either accept all the indicators or
reject them; introduce a hierarchy where some indicators count
more than others or use a time delay for their gradual
introduction.
 But there was doubt whether the Chinese delegation was in a
position to compromise.
 With world shares at 30-month highs, investors seem content
for the G20 to take its time, whereas at the height of the
crisis two years ago markets were baying for policy action.

 By Daniel Flynn and Abhijit Neogy
 PARIS, Feb 18 (Reuters) - China rejected plans on Friday to
use real exchange rates and currency reserves to measure global
economic imbalances, casting heavy doubt on the ability of Group
of 20 major economic powers to reach agreement.
 Speaking shortly before the start of a two-day meeting of
finance ministers and central bankers, Chinese Finance Minister
Xie Xuren also said the G20 should use trade figures rather than
current account balances to assess economic distortions.
 G20 countries, which together account for 85 percent of
world economic output, are trying to agree a set of measurements
as a basis for economic policy guidelines to avoid a repeat of
the 2008 global financial crisis.
 ""We think it is not appropriate to use real effective
exchange rates and reserves,"" Xie said at a meeting with
Russian, Brazilian and Indian counterparts.
 The hardline Chinese stance highlighted splits over how to
define economic imbalances and prescribe action to remedy them,
a key aim of France's G20 presidency.
 A G20 official said China was the only country which spoke
against accepting the list of indicators.
 ""I cannot tell you what will happen tomorrow. Nobody knows,""
he said. ""No-one is trying to push China into a corner.""
 Two other G20 sources said negotiators had failed to reach
agreement on a list of indicators by which to measure imbalances
in the global economy and would leave it up to their finance
ministers to try and seal a deal on specifics on Saturday.
 Even then, agreement was uncertain, they said.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the G20
presidency this year, urged ministers not to get sidetracked by
the indicators dispute and welcomed the fact that China had
agreed to host a G20 seminar on reforming the international
monetary system in Shenzhen in late March.
 ""I want to avoid your debates getting bogged down in
interminable discussion about these indicators, which are
distracting us from the essentials,"" Sarkozy said in a speech.
 The European Union's economic affairs commissioner, Olli
Rehn, said the right indicators to tackle global imbalances
included the current account, the real effective exchange rate
and currency reserves as well as public and private debt.
 ""Especially, the current account account and the real
effective exchange rate are essential,"" Rehn told reporters.
 Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said there was
consensus on two indicators measuring public and private debt
and negotiations were continuing on other measurements.
 But even if all the yardsticks are agreed, there is no sign
of numerical targets even being broached.
 Sarkozy told the ministers that economic policy coordination
was the only way forward. ""Giving priority to national interests
would be the death of the G20,"" he said.
 France has also run into opposition with its two other G20
priorities -- greater transparency and regulation of commodities
prices and reform of the international monetary system.
 
 COMPROMISES
 Differences over the causes of and cures for global economic
imbalances were also on display at a public debate among the
world's top central bankers on Friday.
 Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, reflecting the view of
many Western policymakers, said the world risked protectionism
or another financial crisis if policymakers failed to reduce
currency distortions and other imbalances.
 Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said Beijing
would decide the pace of the appreciation of the yuan and would
not be swayed by pressure from other countries.
 Behind closed doors, senior officials wrangled over possible
compromises to solve the indicators conundrum.
 One option mooted would allow China to opt out of the
balance of payments criterion and use its trade balance instead.
 But Flaherty said Canada opposed that and the two G20
sources said an opt-out was a non-starter.
 The G20 official said China's opposition had left G20
deputies with limited options to suggest on Saturday: either
accept the four indicators or reject them; introduce a hierarchy
where some indicators count more than others or use a time delay
for their gradual introduction.
 With world shares near 30-month highs, investors seem
content for the G20 to take its time, whereas at the height of
the crisis two years ago markets were baying for policy action.
 
 AT ODDS ON MONETARY POLICY
 In a public debate before the G20 meeting, the U.S. and
Japanese central bankers defended their easy money policies
against criticism from some emerging countries that they were
fuelling disorderly capital flows and commodity price spikes.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said faster
growth in emerging markets and ""the maintenance of undervalued
currencies by some countries"" had contributed to price rises and
unsustainable patterns of global spending.
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa acknowledged that
loose monetary policy in the developed world was pushing capital
into emerging economies and helping inflate commodities prices
but said it was necessary nonetheless.
 Emerging powerhouses such as China have already raised
interest rates to combat inflation and complain that ""hot money""
risks destabilising their economies, pointing the finger at the
Federal Reserve's money printing to pump prime its economy via a
$600 billion bond purchase programme.
 In turn, Washington has been urging China to let the yuan
rise faster, which it says is vital for balanced global growth.
 But People's Bank of China Governor Zhou said: ""External
pressure has never been an important factor of consideration and
we have never paid special attention to it.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Major stock markets rose to
over 2-1/2-year highs on Friday as upbeat corporate earnings
offset China's latest tightening move and oil prices steadied
after rising on Middle East political tensions.
 U.S. stock indexes ended up for a third week of gains,
though weak volume could be a signal of a tired run. The MSCI
all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.3 percent
to 347.83, after hitting its highest since late July, 2008.
 Robust earnings and merger activity have fueled a rally in
developed stock markets in recent months. Analysts said the
risk of a pullback is growing, with technicals pointing to
signs of overbought conditions. The market has defied those
expectations for weeks.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 New York, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The euro is likely to add
modest gains against the dollar in the upcoming week, bolstered
by increased expectations of a European Central Bank rate hike
and a fairly positive technical outlook in the short term.
 The euro's rise, however, may be limited by a slew of
political events next week that may inject uncertainty. Some
analysts said the euro may get above $1.38 but was unlikely to
hit $1.40.
 On the charts, the euro's prospects have turned bullish,
analysts said, with support clustered around $1.3250, the 61.8
percent Fibonacci retracement of the January to February
rally.
 Resistance comes in at $1.3745, the Feb 9 high. A break of
that level should bring the rally back though $1.3862, the Feb
2. peak.
 Aside from an upbeat technical view, the euro has benefited
on Friday from a report citing ECB policymaker Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi as saying the central bank will be ready to tighten
policy as price pressures mount. [ID:nLDE71H1DZ]
 ""The euro looks very well supported going forward,"" said
Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist, at Westpac in
New York. ""Aside from a hawkish ECB, central banks have been
buying euros for reserve diversification purposes. I think we
can hit that $1.3862 high again.""
 The positive prognosis on the euro comes amid expectations
of more political debate ahead of the election next Friday in
Ireland. Terms of the European Union loans to Ireland and the
fiscal consolidation plan would be two of the key issues.
 There are also German regional elections, ongoing issues
related to Portugal, and possible debate about the new law on
capital requirement in Spain.
 These may all add an element of caution in the market when
trading the euro.
 Overall, analysts said it may well come down to interest
rate expectations. While the ECB ponders rate increases, the
Federal Reserve continues its Treasury purchase program, which
""was sized so as to represent about a 75-basis-point reduction
in the fed funds target rate,"" said David Watt, senior fixed
income and currency strategist, at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto.
 ""As the...ECB muses on rate hikes, the Fed is still
effectively 'cutting' rates. Dollar rallies tend to fade when
these factors are put in focus,"" Watt said.
 Bini Smaghi's comments come just two weeks after ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet talked down the prospect of rate
hikes during an ECB February press conference, an about face
after sounding hawkish in January.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was up 0.6
percent against the dollar at $1.3685 , after hitting
a high of $1.3716 on electronic trading platform EBS, its
highest in more than a week.
 On the week, the euro rose 1.3 percent vs the dollar,
rising after two straight weeks of losses.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index fell 0.4 percent <.DXY> to
77.679.
 Surprisingly the dollar, a traditional safe-haven along
with the Swiss franc, failed to capitalize on heightened
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
 Westpac's Franulovich said the dollar's weakness amid
tension in that region may be attributed to general low
volatility across all asset classes, prompting investors to
take on more risk. Implied volatilities, which tend to reflect
risk sentiment in the currency market were trading near
long-term lows.
 Analysts said the dollar's performance next week depends on
action in the euro.
 ""The U.S. economic numbers next week won't change the
market's view on QE2 (quantitative easing), which is still
expected to end in June as scheduled, or interest rate
expectations,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist,
at Wells Fargo in New York.
 Meanwhile, currency speculators continued to trim bets
against the U.S. dollar in the latest week as they went short
the yen for the first time since June, data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday. See

 * Ruling could set precedent for China rare earth curbs
 * Decision expected to be made public by early summer
(Updates throughout)
 WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization
on Friday issued a confidential preliminary ruling in a
landmark case against China's export restrictions on raw
materials used to manufacture steel, aluminum and chemical
products.
 The United States, European Union and Mexico launched the
case in 2009, complaining that Chinese export restrictions on
minerals such as bauxite and magnesium discriminated against
foreign manufacturers and gave an unfair advantage to domestic
producers.
 Beijing has argued it needed to restrict exports of the raw
materials for environmental reasons.
""Under WTO rules, this interim report is confidential and we
cannot comment on its contents at this time,"" said Nefeterius
McPherson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's
Office.
 ""The report will be made public when it is circulated to
WTO members. We currently expect the final report to be
circulated sometime in late spring or early summer of 2011,""
McPherson said.
 The United States, EU and Mexico argue that China's export
curbs violated both general WTO rules and specific commitments
that Beijing made when it joined the world trade body in 2001.
 The case does not cover China's export restrictions on rare
earth minerals used in smart phones, electric car motors and
high-tech industrial equipment which have also raised concern
in the United States, EU and Japan.
 McPherson said there was still a possibility of the United
States filing a WTO challenge on that front.
 ""We have been and remain very concerned about China's
systemic use of export restraints,"" she said.
 A former WTO appellate body judge said the ruling will be
precedent-setting.
 ""If the United States prevails in this dispute it would be
a very significant ruling related to increasingly widespread
phenomenon of export restrictions in world trade,"" said James
Bacchus, now at Greenberg Traurig in Washington.
 If China wins, then ""other kinds of export restrictions
imposed by China and other countries may be protected by
environmental defenses as well,"" Bacchus said.
 China argues that it must restrict the production and
export of the raw materials in the WTO dispute and rare earths
to protect the environment and conserve its own resources.

 NEW YORK, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Major stock markets rose to
over 2-1/2-year highs on Friday as upbeat corporate earnings
offset China's latest tightening move and oil prices steadied

supply.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose

 Robust earnings and merger activity have fueled a rally in

 By Julie Haviv
 New York, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The euro gained against rival
currencies on Friday, bolstered by raised expectations that the
European Central Bank will raise interest rates, with more
gains likely if geopolitical concerns continue work against the
U.S. dollar.
 Lower expectations in recent weeks of ECB monetary
tightening came to a halt after a Bloomberg News report quoted
ECB policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi saying the central bank
will be ready to tighten policy as price pressures mount.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro was up 0.5
percent against the dollar at $1.3675 and climbed 0.3 percent
against the yen at 113.64. Against the Swiss franc, the euro
was 0.1 percent higher at 1.2932 francs.
 Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster,
New Jersey, said the euro/dollar is poised to end the session
above its 21-day moving average at around $1.3630 and said the
next level would be the $1.3740-50 area.
 ""It's just more dollar selling as we move into the holiday
weekend. Bini Smaghi's comments and the Iranian warships
getting Egyptian approval to move through the Suez Canal have
oil and metals up and the dollar down. The euro, yen and Swiss
franc are benefiting,"" he said.
 He added that upward momentum for the euro/dollar would be
bolstered by a move above $1.3725, which marks the top of a
counter-trend consolidation pattern, and could provide impetus
for traders to target the February high around $1.3860.
 Bini Smaghi's comments come just two weeks ago ECB
President Trichet talked down the prospect of rate hikes during
an ECB February press conference, an about face after sounding
hawkish in January.
 ""The caution flag has been raised,"" said Greg Anderson, G10
strategist at CitiFX in New York. ""For ourselves, we threw up
our hands a couple of weeks ago by taking equal-sized EUR and
USD shorts in our overlay portfolio and refusing to take any
EURUSD positions in our trade idea portfolio.""
 The best trade remains to short EUR against the
Scandinavian currencies, he added.
 The U.S. dollar fell 0.4 percent against a basket of
currencies to 77.679.
 ""When uncertainty in the Middle East or North Korea comes
up and is at a low heat, it tends to be dollar negative. But if
things heat up and the missiles start flying, you would see a a
big safe-haven bid for the dollar,"" said Forex.com's Dolan.
 Foreign exchange options are trading in tight ranges ahead
of the U.S. Presidents Day holiday on Monday, keeping implied
volatility close to long term lows.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended easy money
policies in advanced economies against the charge they are
overheating emerging markets, saying factors such as exchange
rate rigidity are also to blame.
 The dollar fell against the yen for a third straight
session and was last at 83.11 yen, a 0.3 percent drop.
 Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in
Paris on Friday and Saturday, but traders expect few new
developments.
 Germany's PPI data, which showed its largest monthly
increase in producer prices since mid 2008, emboldened the
stance that the ECB may hike interest rates within the next few
months.
 Talk that the ECB was buying Portuguese government bonds
also lifted the euro.
 The euro slid overnight on data that showed emergency
overnight borrowing from the ECB at exceptionally high levels
on Friday, although it was not clear why borrowing was so
high.
 Euro sentiment soured in recent sessions due to concerns
that euro zone policymakers have made little headway in solving
the year-long debt crisis, and on increasing worries that
Portugal may seek a bailout by April.
 The yield on five-year Portuguese government bonds hit a
fresh euro lifetime high on Friday.
 The Australian dollar briefly hit a session low of $1.0088
against the U.S. dollar after China's central bank raised its
bank reserve requirement for the second time this year,
following up on an interest rate rise earlier this month.
 It was last trading up 0.4 percent at $1.0151.

 By Toni Vorobyova and Julien Toyer
 PARIS, Feb 18 (Reuters) - China rejected plans to use real
exchange rates and currency reserves to measure global economic
imbalances, casting doubt on the ability of Group of 20 major
economic powers to reach agreement at a meeting on Friday.
 Speaking shortly before the start of a two-day meeting of
finance ministers and central bankers, Chinese Finance Minister
Xie Xuren also said the G20 should use trade figures rather than
current account balances to assess economic distortions.
 China's trade surplus has diminished of late.
 G20 countries, which together account for 85 percent of
world economic output, are trying to agree on a set of
measurements as a basis for economic policy guidelines to avoid
a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis.
 ""We think it is not appropriate to use real effective
exchange rates and reserves,"" Xie said at a meeting with
Russian, Brazilian and Indian counterparts.
 The hardline Chinese stance highlighted splits over how to
define economic imbalances and prescribe action to remedy
distortions, although negotiators said several compromise
proposals were under discussion.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the G20
presidency this year, urged ministers not to get sidetracked by
the indicators dispute, and welcomed the fact that China had
agreed to host a G20 seminar on reforming the international
monetary system in Shenzhen in late March.
 ""I want to avoid your debates getting bogged down in
interminable discussion about these indicators, which are
distracting us from the essentials,"" Sarkozy said in a speech.
 The European Union's economic affairs commissioner, Olli
Rehn, said the right indicators to tackle global imbalances
included the current account, the real effective exchange rate
and currency reserves as well as public and private debt.
 ""Especially, the current account account and the real
effective exchange rate are essential,"" Rehn told reporters.
 Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said there was
consensus on two indicators measuring public and private debt
and negotiations were continuing on other measurements.
 But even if the yardsticks are agreed, there is no sign of
numerical targets even being broached.
 Sarkozy told the ministers that economic policy coordination
was the only way forward. ""Giving priority to national interests
would be the death of the G20,"" he said.
 
 COMPROMISES
 Differences over the causes of and cures for global economic
imbalances were also on display at a public debate among the
world's top central bankers on Friday.
 Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, reflecting the view of
many Western policymakers, said the world risked protectionism
or another financial crisis if policymakers failed to reduce
currency distortions and other imbalances.
 Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said Beijing
would decide the pace of the appreciation of the yuan and would
not be swayed by pressure from other countries.
 Behind closed doors, senior officials wrangled over possible
compromises to solve the indicators conundrum.
 A European source said one possibility was to list several
indicators -- current accounts, exchange rates, currency
reserves, public debt and deficits, and private savings -- while
making clear the prime focus would be on current accounts.
 Another option mooted would allow China to opt out of the
balance of payments criterion and use its trade balance instead,
but Flaherty said Canada opposed that.
 France has also run into opposition with its two other G20
priorities -- greater transparency and regulation of commodities
prices and reform of the international monetary system.
 With world shares near 30-month highs, investors seem
content for the G20 to take its time, whereas at the height of
the crisis two years ago markets were baying for policy action.
 ""Some may view this sort of outcome as a lost opportunity to
prevent future risks, but markets would probably not welcome a
heavy-handed attempt to subjugate domestic priorities for the
sake of external balance, which could be disruptive unless done
just right,"" Barclays Capital wrote in a research note.
 
 AT ODDS ON MONETARY POLICY
 In a public debate before the G20 meeting, the U.S. and
Japanese central bankers defended their easy money policies
against criticism from some emerging countries that they were
fuelling disorderly capital flows and commodity price spikes.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said faster
growth in emerging markets and ""the maintenance of undervalued
currencies by some countries"" had contributed to price rises and
unsustainable patterns of global spending.
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa acknowledged that
loose monetary policy in the developed world was pushing capital
into emerging economies and helping inflate commodities prices
but said it was necessary nonetheless.
 Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said his country
would have to take new measures to control capital flows if the
inflow of money continued to grow.
 Emerging powerhouses China and India have already raised
interest rates to combat inflation and emerging powers complain
that ""hot money"" risks destabilising their economies, pointing
the finger at the Federal Reserve's money printing to pump prime
its economy via a $600 billion bond purchase programme.
 In turn, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has been
urging China to let the yuan rise more swiftly, something
Washington says is vital for balanced global growth.
 But People's Bank of China Governor Zhou said: ""External
pressure has never been an important factor of consideration and
we have never paid special attention to it.""

 In a paper prepared for the two-day G20 meeting, the
International Monetary Fund said euro zone debt tensions still
posed a threat to global recovery, while fast-growing emerging
nations risked overheating and surging food prices posed an
inflationary risk.
 The U.S. quantitative easing could cause a destabilising

(Adds vessels not scheduled to sail through canal on Saturday)
 By Marwa Awad
 CAIRO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Egypt has approved the passage of
two Iranian navy ships through the Suez Canal, an army source
said, a move that could annoy Israel, whose foreign minister has
called Iran's actions a provocation.
 ""Egypt has agreed to the passage of two Iranian ships
through the Suez Canal,"" the army source told Reuters.
 State television and Egypt's official news agency
subsequently reported the news, without giving sources.
 Iran's request was an early diplomatic test for Egypt's
interim military government, which has close ties to the United
States and has been ruling since Feb. 11 when President Hosni
Mubarak stepped down in the face of a popular revolt.
 Egypt's Western allies are watching for hints of any shift
in policy towards its Middle East neighbours, especially Israel
with which it has a peace treaty.
 The two ships would be the first Iranian military vessels to
transit the canal since Iran's 1979 revolution.
 To navigate the strategic waterway, naval vessels need the
approval of Egypt's foreign and defence ministries.
 It was not clear when the ships would enter the canal. They
were not on the list of vessels scheduled to sail through on
Saturday, a Suez Canal Authority official said.
 Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Wednesday
that Iran's plan to send the ships through the canal en route to
Syria was a ""provocation"".
 Israel's state-funded Channel One television said later
Lieberman, a stridently far-right partner in the conservative
coalition, had spoken out of turn and the Defence Ministry ""had
preferred to ignore"" the ships' approach.
 There was no immediate comment from Israel after approval
was given.
 Egypt's military said the request stated the Iranian ships
did not carry military equipment or nuclear or chemical cargo.
It said they were in the Red Sea, at the canal's southern end.

 Incumbent: Mwai Kibaki
 Date of Birth: November 15, 1931
 Term: 5-year term expires 2012
 Incumbent: First elected to office in 2002
 Key Facts:
 - Kibaki, a long-time Kenyan vice president and government
minister, quit to join the opposition, where he spent about ten
years before winning the presidential race in 2002 as head of an
opposition alliance. In 2007, he formed a new alliance, the
Party of National Unity (PNU), as his re-election vehicle and
was declared the winner in the Kenya's closest ever vote.
 - Thousands of pro-opposition protesters immediately
launched angry demonstrations after opposition leader Raila
Odinga accused Kibaki of widespread rigging.
 - The allegations led to weeks of Kenya's worst ethnic and
political clashes, ending only after Kibaki and Odinga agreed to
form a coalition government, with Odinga as prime minister.
 - Kenyans are generally happy with Kibaki's economic
performance, and were delighted at his introduction of free
primary and secondary education. Critics say he has done little
to combat graft and tribalism.
 - Kibaki has cultivated an image of staying above the fray
of Kenyan politics -- he never criticizes his opponents by name
-- and has a reputation as a sharp wit when giving off-the-cuff
Swahili speeches in his rolling baritone.
 - Among Kenya's richest men, he has vast land holdings and
interests in hotels, insurance and farming. Kibaki enjoys
playing golf and socializing at Nairobi's exclusive clubs.
 - Married with four children, Kibaki was educated at
Uganda's Makerere University and the London School of Economics,
where he was the first African to graduate with a first-class
degree. He returned to Makerere in 1958 as an economics
lecturer, and launched his political career in his homeland in
the early 1960s.

 Western nations suspect Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear

 Souri said it hoped for an early resolution of this matter

 By Julie Haviv
 New York, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The euro gained broadly on
Friday on heightened expectations the European Central Bank
will raise interest rates, but technical factors and renewed
sovereign debt concerns were seen limiting the European
currency's upside.
 Traders cited a Bloomberg report that quoted ECB
policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi saying the central bank will be
ready to tighten policy as price pressures mount, as the euro's
driver. [ID:nLDE71H1DZ]
 The euro reached a session high of $1.3646  after the
report but selling interest just above the 21-day moving
average of $1.3650 slowed its advance, according to IFR
markets. But traders said the market may make another run at
that level. It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.3628.
 Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto, said Germany's PPI data, which showed its largest
monthly increase in producer prices since mid 2008, lends
credence to Bini Smaghi's statement.
 ""The rhetoric has shifted and become more hawkish and it
seems the ECB is setting themselves up to tighten monetary
policy, which I see happening within next couple of months,"" he
said.
 After $1.3650, the 100-day moving average, the top is at
$1.3736, he said.
 Foreign exchange options are trading in tight ranges ahead
of the U.S. Presidents Day holiday on Monday, keeping implied
volatility close to long term lows.
 Talk that the ECB was buying Portuguese government bonds
also lifted the euro.
 However, the euro had slid overnight on data that showed
emergency overnight borrowing from the ECB at exceptionally
high levels on Friday, although it was not clear why borrowing
was so high. [ID:nLDE71H0H1]
 Euro sentiment soured in recent sessions due to concerns
that euro zone policymakers have made little headway in solving
the year-long debt crisis, and on increasing worries that
Portugal may seek a bailout by April. [ID:nLDE71G284]
 The yield on five-year Portuguese government bonds hit a
fresh euro lifetime high on Friday.
 ""The market is again worried about financial stress within
the euro and a bank getting in trouble,"" said Adam Cole, global
head of currency strategy at RBC.
 The market would have to wait for weekly central bank
liquidity figures to get a better idea of why such borrowing
has increased, he added.
 If the sudden spike was down to an error, the distortion
could last until the ECB's next 7-day funding operation on
Tuesday.
 CHINA RAISES RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
 The Australian dollar  briefly hit a session low
of $1.0088 against the U.S. dollar after China's central bank
raised its bank reserve requirement for the second time this
year, following up on an interest rate rise earlier this month.
[ID:nTOE71H068]. It was last trading nearly flat at $1.0112.
 Investors kept a wary eye on tensions in the Middle East
and North Africa as protests continued in Bahrain, Libya, Yemen
and Iran, which some analysts said helped to support the Swiss
franc, a traditional safe-haven currency. [ID:nLDE71G28W]
 The Swiss franc hit its highest against the euro in two
weeks at 1.2895 per euro .
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended easy money
policies in advanced economies against the charge they are
overheating emerging markets, saying factors such as exchange
rate rigidity are also to blame. [ID:nNLLIDE7W1].
 Bernanke was speaking ahead of a meeting of G20 finance
ministers and central bankers starting later in the day.
Traders expect few new developments regarding addressing global
imbalances or any agreements on currencies to emerge.
 The dollar rose against the yen for the first time in three
days and was last at 83.38 yen , up 0.1. percent.

 NEW YORK, Feb 18 (Reuters) - World stocks came off early
highs on Friday after China raised bank required reserves to a
record to battle inflation, while oil prices climbed on
concerns unrest in the Middle East and North Africa could
disrupt supplies.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
0.2 percent higher after earlier hitting a fresh 30-month high.
U.S. stocks were little changed after recent advances pushed
indexes to more than 30-month highs wit Wall Street eyeing a

 China raised banks' required reserves half a percentage
point on Friday to 19.5 percent for the biggest banks, the
second such increase this year as government continues the
fight against inflation. [ID:nTOE71H068]
 ""They have been trying to curb liquidity for some time, so
little surprise and not as bad as a benchmark rate rise, but
still slightly weighing on sentiment,"" said Andrey Kryuchenkov
from VTB Capital.
 China has also increased interest rates three times in the
past four months and ordered banks to issue fewer loans. But
its annual inflation still rebounded to 4.9 percent in January
from 4.6 percent a month earlier.
 European shares <.FTEU3> fell slightly, though still
hovering near 29-month highs, with miners among the worst
performers after China's move to raise banks' reserve
requirements.
 In Paris, China rejected plans to use real exchange rates
and currency reserves to measures global economic imbalances,
casting doubt on the ability of Group of 20 major economic
powers to reach agreement at a meeting on Friday.
 Rising inflation, meanwhile, was underlined by German
producer prices for January exceeding forecasts to post their
strongest year-on-year rise since October 2008, up 5.7
percent.
 The euro  edged higher against the U.S. dollar after
a senior European Central Bank official was quoted by a media
report as saying that interest rates could be raised.
 OIL IN FOCUS
 U.S. March light crude futures rose 90 cents to 87.26 a
barrel . Brent crude futures  were flat at $102.55
a barrel in volatile trading.
 Oil prices -- and their impact on global inflation --
remained in focus as protesters in Bahrain and Libya bury
people killed in recent clashes. [ID:nLDE71G28W]
 At least two people were killed in Yemen on Friday when
clashes broke out between police and protesters, witnesses
said, and thousands turned out in Bahrain and Libya to mourn

latter's plans to send navy ships through the Suez Canal, a
move that Israel has called a ""provocation"". [ID:nLDE71G0CU]
 Unrest in the Middle East kept gold close to a five-week
high and silver near its strongest since 1980. Spot gold

 Sterling  rose on market talk that another member
of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee had moved

 By Glenn Somerville and Dan Flynn
 PARIS, Feb 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner sought on Friday to sound a note of confidence about
global recovery and again nudge China toward faster currency
appreciation.
 But ahead of a meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs, China
rejected the notion that its currency practices were a subject
for others to debate or an appropriate target to blame for
economic imbalances.
 Geithner told a high-level seminar organized by the Eurofi
think tank that economic indicators point to a strengthening
global economy but said that policymakers must keep track of
forces that could still potentially destabilize growth
 ""Of course, we have to look at measures of imbalances.
There's no alternative,"" he said. ""We need to look at measures
of external imbalances like the current account as well as ...
internal imbalances.""
The G20 gathering is expected to discuss what indicators are
most appropriate for gauging the extent of imbalances like
excess reserves or big trade surpluses. But widespread
differences among members limit the chance of a broad agreement.
 Shortly before Geithner spoke, China -- whose huge trade and
current account surplus with the United States is one of the
reasons for the debate -- rejected plans to use real exchange
rates and currency reserves to measure economic imbalances.
 Chinese Finance Minister Xie Xuren also said the G20 should
use trade figures rather than current account balances to assess
economic distortions. [ID:nLDE71H0AV]
 Geithner didn't list specific indicators he thought should
be used for measuring imbalances -- a first step for
policymakers to come up later with ""indicative guidelines"" for
corrective action.
 
 POSITIVE ON GROWTH
 He sounded bullish about the world economy's prospects.
 ""There's justifiable growing confidence out there,"" he said.
 ""You're seeing the challenges and risks shift, the emerging
world growing very rapidly, and facing the challenge of how to
use monetary policy to help contain inflation pressures.""
 He said both the United States and Europe need to impose
further restraints on leverage risk-taking by financial
institutions and tighten supervision of derivatives markets.
 The G20 meeting, under France's leadership, is to boost a
process for identifying the type of imbalances that were blamed
for contributing to and aggravating the financial crisis and
recession that struck the global economy in 2008 and 2009.
 Geithner implied it may be a lengthy process.
 ""We're trying to build an initial consensus on the
international monetary system that would build a system less
prone to imbalance and the huge imbalances in capital flows,"" he
told the group.
 For the Obama administration, a key piece of that is to keep
urging China to let its yuan currency, also called the renminbi,
rise more rapidly. The U.S. view is that doing so would mean
China would rely more on domestic demand for its growth and
would be itself be less vulnerable to inflation.
 ""We're trying to build a system that has a better balance of
exchange rate policy in large emerging countries,"" Geithner
said, without naming China.
 ""We've got to make sure we keep our eyes on the basic
imperative, to heal the damage caused by this crisis and get
stronger growth globally, and particularly in the major
economies,"" he added.

 By Toni Vorobyova and Gernot Heller
 PARIS, Feb 18 (Reuters) - China rejected plans to use real
exchange rates and currency reserves to measures global economic
imbalances, casting doubt on the ability of Group of 20 major
economic powers to reach agreement at a meeting on Friday.
 Speaking shortly before the start of the two-day meeting of
finance ministers and central bankers, Chinese Finance Minister
Xie Xuren also said the G20 should use trade figures rather than
current account balances to assess economic distortions.
 ""We think it is not appropriate to use real effective
exchange rates and reserves,"" Xie said at a meeting with
Russian, Brazilian and Indian counterparts, who collectively
make up the BRIC group of major emerging economies.
 ""Emerging markets, to deal with financial crises and
economic shocks, they need to set up a certain amount of
reserves,"" he said.
 The hardline Chinese stance highlighted splits over how to
define economic imbalances and prescribe action to avoid future
financial crises, although negotiators said several compromise
proposals were under discussions.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said he was not
sure there would be any agreement this weekend on a set of
indicators, as G20 president France had hoped.
 ""It is uncertain whether the countries will agree on all
indicators, but I think agreement on some is possible,"" Noda
told reporters. ""From working group discussions, I get the
impression countries are now split in half about their
opinions.""
 Differences over the causes of and ways to cure global
economic imbalances were also on display at a public debate
among the world's top central bankers on Friday.
 Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, reflecting the view of
many Western policymakers, said the world risked protectionism
or another financial crisis if policymakers failed to reduce
currency distortions and other imbalances.
 Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said Beijing
would decide the pace of the appreciation of the yuan on its own
and would not be swayed by pressure from other countries. Simply
adjusting exchange rates would not influence Asians' savings
behaviour, he said.
 ""A reform of the international monetary system is in order
so as to prevent the over-concentration of foreign assets in one
particular currency,"" he said in a reference to the dollar,
urging greater use of IMF Special Drawing Rights instead.

 Germany, the world's number two exporter after China, said
it had no problem with including a balance of payments indicator
as part of a set of five measurements. Deputy Finance Minister
Joerg Asmussen said a ""vast majority"" of G20 countries wanted a
deal all five indicators.
 One European source said a possible compromise could involve
listing the other indicators -- exchange rates, currency
reserves, public debt and deficits, and private savings -- while
making clear the prime focus would be on current accounts.
 Another option mooted by deputy finance ministers would be
to give China an opt-out from the balance of payments criterion,
allowing it to use its trade balance instead, two sources
involved in the negotiations said.
 France has run into opposition with its push for greater
transparency and regulation of commodities prices and a reform
of the international monetary system and is pinning its hopes on
measuring imbalances in the world economy, where the G20 nations
account for around 85 percent of GDP.
 Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said she hoped the first
ministerial meeting of France's year-long G20 presidency would
agree a preliminary list of indicators in a two-step process
leading to guidelines for unwinding distortions later this year.
 With world shares near 30-month highs, driven by bullish
views of economic growth, investors seem content for the G20 to
take its time, whereas at the height of the crisis two years ago
markets were baying for policy action.
 ""Some may view this sort of outcome as a lost opportunity to
prevent future risks, but markets would probably not welcome a
heavy-handed attempt to subjugate domestic priorities for the
sake of external balance, which could be disruptive unless done
just right,"" Barclays Capital wrote in a research note.
 In a public debate before the G20 meeting, the U.S. and
Japanese central bankers defended their easy money policies
against criticism from some emerging countries that they were
fuelling disorderly capital flows and commodity prices.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said faster
growth in emerging markets and ""the maintenance of undervalued
currencies by some countries"" had contributed to price rises and
unsustainable patterns of global spending.
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa acknowledged that
loose monetary policy in the developed world was pushing capital
into emerging economies and helping inflate commodities prices
but said it was necessary nonetheless.
 Emerging powerhouses China and India have already raised
interest rates to combat inflation and emerging powers complain
that ""hot money"" risks destabilising their economies, pointing
the finger at the Federal Reserve's money printing to pump prime
its economy via a $600 billion bond purchase programme.
 
 PRESSURE ON YUAN
 In a paper prepared for the two-day G20 meeting, the
International Monetary Fund said euro zone debt tensions still
posed a threat to global recovery, while fast-growing emerging
nations risked overheating and surging food prices posed an
inflationary risk.
 The U.S. quantitative easing could cause a destabilising
flood of capital -- the charge levelled by China and others --
the IMF said, though it conceded this had not happened so far.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has been urging
China to let the yuan rise more swiftly, something Washington
says is vital for balanced global growth.
 But People's Bank of China Governor Zhou said: ""External
pressure has never been an important factor of consideration and
we have never paid special attention to it.""

 By Rie Ishiguro and Gui Qing Koh
 PARIS, Feb 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke defended easy money policies in advanced economies
against the charge they are overheating emerging markets,
saying factors such as exchange rate rigidity are also to
blame.
 Speaking ahead of an economic summit in Paris that will
include many critics of the Fed's aggressive bond buying
program, Bernanke acknowledged that strong capital flows from
advanced economies to emerging markets may be having negative
spillover effects.
 ""Capital flows are once again posing some notable
challenges for international macroeconomic and financial
stability,"" he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a
Banque de France event in Paris before meetings of the finance
ministers and central bankers of the Group of 20 leading
economies.
 However, he said that although policy-makers in the
emerging markets clearly face challenges, such concerns should
be weighed against stronger emerging market growth and steps
emerging economies themselves can take.
 Central bankers and finance ministers of economies that
make up 85 percent of the world's economy are trying to smooth
imbalances of trade and investment to ensure steadier economic
growth and prevent shocks like the recent crisis.
 The United States is under fire not only for ultra
accommodative monetary policy, but for a gaping budget deficit
that raises concern that if left unchecked, it could some day
lead to default.
 Bernanke's own unorthodox $600 billion bond buying
initiative launched in November has stirred harsh criticism
from countries around the world, and he has used international
venues to defend it before.
 U.S. quantitative easing measures have been attacked for
driving down the value of the dollar, hurting emerging economy
exports and inflating asset bubbles, and the Fed chairman can
expect to hear about it from his counterparts at the summit.
 Bernanke did not mention inflation concerns directly except
to say that strong demand in emerging markets is contributing
to global commodity price increases, something which affects
the most advanced economies as well.
 Gradually smoothing global imbalances of trade and
investment is a top priority for G20 officials. Officials have
set themselves the goal of drawing up a list of indicators to
measure imbalances, with the aim of making growth more stable
and less prone to cycles of boom and bust.
 In comments similar to ones he has made in the past, the
Fed chairman said faster growth in emerging markets is one
factor driving strong capital flows into those economies.
Furthermore, emerging market policy-makers have tools at their
disposal -- including exchange rate adjustment and monetary
policy -- to prevent overheating, he said.
 ""Countries with excessive and unsustainable trade surpluses
will need to allow their exchange rates to better reflect
market fundamentals and increase their efforts to substitute
domestic demand for exports,"" he said.
 The argument that greater currency flexibility is necessary
to right imbalances is a recurring theme for U.S. officials who
have persistently sought to pressure China to allow its yuan
currency to float more freely against the dollar.
 U.S. officials say that by keeping the yuan weak, the
Chinese government is supporting an export-led economy that
leads to its large trade surplus with the United States.
 Washington wants to keep the spotlight on the yuan at the
G20.
 Advanced economies are also experiencing the ill effects of
strong capital flows into emerging economies in the form of
higher prices, Bernanke argued.
 ""Spillovers can go both ways. For example, resurgent demand
in emerging markets has contributed significantly to the sharp
recent run-up in global commodity prices,"" he said.
 Higher prices for food and energy have raised worries about
inflation around the world and are prompting many central
bankers to consider tightening financial conditions even as
some economic recoveries remain shaky. China and India have
already raised interest rates to combat inflation, and Britain
is under pressure to do the same.
 Bernanke conceded the need for U.S. fiscal discipline as
part of improving global balances of trade and investment.
Countries with persistently high trade deficits must increase
saving and put their fiscal houses in order, he said, a
reference to record U.S. budget deficits.
 Major economies at the G20 were split on how to measure
imbalances, with China resisting including measurement of
exchange rates and currency reserves, sources said.

 * Money market and debt tensions likely to check gains
 
 (Recasts, updates prices, adds quote)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded on Friday on a
media report that quoted a senior European Central Bank official
as saying that interest rates could be raised, although renewed
debt and money market tensions were likely to cap gains.
Traders cited a Bloomberg report which quoted ECB
policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi saying the central bank will be
ready to tighten policy as price pressures mount, as the euro's
driver.
 The euro reversed earlier losses and rose 80 pips against
the dollar to hit a session high of $1.3645 and was last up 0.2
percent on the day. The currency was also supported by talk that
ECB was buying Portuguese government bonds.
 ""The euro is moving up on those Bini Smaghi comments but the
overall picture remains a bit negative,"" said Ian Stannard,
senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas. ""Any move up will be
short lived as the market focuses on debt concerns and any moves
to stall find a solution to the euro zone's problems.""
 Sentiment towards the euro has soured in recent sessions
due to concerns that euro zone policymakers have made little
headway in solving the year-long debt crisis, and on increasing
worries that Portugal may seek a bailout by April.
 The yield on five-year Portuguese government bonds hit a
fresh euro lifetime high on Friday.
 Also weighing on the euro was data which showed emergency
overnight borrowing from the ECB at exceptionally high levels on
Friday, although it was not clear why borrowing was so high.
 ""The market is again worried about financial stress within
the euro and a bank getting in trouble,"" said Adam Cole, global
head of currency strategy at RBC.
 However, he added that the market would have to wait for
weekly central bank liquidity figures to get a better idea of
why such borrowing has increased.
 If the sudden spike was down to an error, the distortion
could last until the ECB's next 7-day funding operation on
Tuesday.
 
 CHINA RAISES RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
 The Australian dollar briefly hit a session low against the
U.S. dollar after China's central bank raised its bank reserve
requirement for the second time this year, following up on an
interest rate rise earlier this month as it ratchets up its
monetary tightening campaign.
 The Australian dollar initially fell around 20 pips to a
session low of $1.0088 after China announced it will raise
reserve requirements, before recovering. It was last trading at
$1.0105, down 0.1 percent on the day.
 ""The market has now accepted that rate hikes, whether
through benchmark lending rates or reserve requirements are
likely to be a regular occurrence and as such, the move should
fade over the next few hours,"" said Chris Walker, currency
strategist at UBS.
 Investors kept a wary eye on tensions in the Middle East and
North Africa as protests continued in Bahrain, Libya, Yemen and
Iran, which some analysts said helped to support the Swiss
franc, a traditional safe-haven currency.
 The Swiss franc hit its highest against the euro in two
weeks at 1.2895 per euro. This week has seen broad gains in the
Swiss currency and the euro and the dollar are poised to end the
week lower.
 Analysts say that geopolitical concerns are prompting flows
into the ""safe-haven"" Swiss currency, but Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt argued that
gains in stock markets this week suggested that risk aversion
was limited.
 The dollar index, which tracks its value against a currency
basket, was down slightly at 78.11.
 Investors were taking a breather after pushing the dollar
lower for much of the week, analysts said, adding that many were
hesitant to extend short positions in the U.S. currency -- bets
it will fall further -- before a U.S. market holiday on Monday.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended easy money
policies in advanced economies against the charge they are
overheating emerging markets, saying factors such as exchange
rate rigidity are also to blame..
 Bernanke was speaking ahead of a meeting of G20 finance
ministers and central bankers starting later in the day. Traders
expect few new developments regarding addressing global
imbalances or any agreements on currencies to emerge.

 LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Investors may start to see
warning signs soon as their allocations into risky assets move
to extremes only half way into the first quarter, while earnings
and inflation-related risks are mounting.
 Inflation, indeed, is taking centre stage at the Paris
meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs, who are expected to make
only glacial progress on an ambitious agenda including proposals
to curb the volatility of food and fuel prices.
 World stocks, as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>, have
raced to 30-month highs in the past week. The index has already
gained more than 5 percent this year, more than half of last
year's total gains.
 The flow of money into U.S. equity markets is gathering
pace. According to Thomson Reuters Lipper data, investors put a
net $9.45 billion into U.S. equity mutual funds in the week
ended Feb. 16, the highest since mid-June and four times the
prior week's inflows.
 ""It's a typical beginning of the year rotation where
investors are taking profit on last year's winners and chasing
laggards,"" said Didier Saint-Georges, a member of the investment
committee at private asset manager Carmignac Gestion in Paris.
 Emerging stocks have turned lower so far this year with a
loss of nearly 3 percent year to date <.MSCIEF>, having risen 16
percent last year.
 ""It doesn't take into account risks hovering over the euro
zone sovereign debt problem and related risk on the banks. In
the short term there's a money flow that could reverse,"" he
said.
 The euro zone sovereign debt crisis certainly is lingering,
with banks tapping the European Central Bank for an unusually
high amount of emergency overnight borrowing in the past week.
 ECB figures showed on Friday banks borrowed more than 16
billion euros in costly overnight funding -- the highest since
June 2009, on top of Thursday's 15 billion euros. The sum
compared with 1.2 billion euros borrowed earlier in the week.
 This is fanning fears that a euro zone bank could be facing
serious funding problems.
 Ireland goes to the polls on Feb. 25 in the first general
election since the debt crisis. German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's party also faces a series of possible defeats in seven
state elections, starting with Hamburg on Feb. 20.
 ""This could further limit her room for manoeuvre in EU
fiscal matters,"" BNP Paribas said in a note to clients.
 
 AMBER LIGHTS
 Euro zone business and consumer sentiment indicators are due
in the coming week, while many European financial companies,
including Commerzbank , Royal Bank of Scotland ,
Allianz  and Credit Agricole , report their
results.
According to Thomson Reuters data, financial companies on
the European benchmark DJ STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> have so far
reported earnings that are 8.3 percent below their estimates.
 Five out of 10 equity sectors in the DJ STOXX 600 index
reported earnings that are below estimates. Overall, however,
actual earnings are 4.4 percent higher than the estimates.
 The monthly fund managers survey from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch showed average cash holdings fell to 3.5 percent
in February from 3.7 percent, a level that the bank views as an
equity sell signal.
 In the past, investors have sold stocks in subsequent weeks
five out of seven times when cash was at this level.
 ""From the technical and policy view there are some amber
warning lights,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy
at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh.
 ""Looking ahead, I am a little concerned. All the good
earnings news is by and large over.""
 And finally, investors will be monitoring the impact of
political turmoil in the Middle East, which helped push the
region's debt insurance costs across the board and lifted London
crude oil prices to 2-1/2 year highs above $104 a barrel 
in the past week.
 The cost of insuring Bahrain's sovereign debt against
default for five years hit fresh 18-month highs as thousands
gathered to bury protestors killed in a crackdown against
anti-government protestors this week.

 * Finance min warns sharp gains to Sing dollar poses risks
 * Government seen calling election in second quarter

 By Kevin Lim and Charmian Kok	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Singapore unveiled a budget on
Friday brimming with handouts for poorer citizens, with an eye
on elections that are widely expected in the second quarter and
the social impact of rapidly rising prices.	
 Measures for the upcoming financial year included a package
of benefits for Singaporeans worth S$6.6 billion ($5.2 billion),
as well as lower income taxes for middle-income wage earners,
Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam told parliament in his
budget speech.	
 Analysts said that was more than double the incentives
announced in the budget before the last election in 2006.	
 Other handouts included increased subsidies for first-time
buyers of government-built HDB apartments and grants to
lower-income Singaporeans in the form of salary top-ups. Some
benefits would be paid into retirement accounts. 
 ""The incentives are mainly for lower-income and
middle-income households,"" said Chow Penn Nee, an economist at
United Overseas Bank. ""It is the last budget before elections.""	
 The next election must be held by February 2012.	
 In response to growing inflationary pressures, Tharman said
the central bank would allow the currency to appreciate in order
to moderate price increases, but warned that any sharp gains in
the Singapore dollar posed dangers to the economy.	
 ""Using the exchange rate to offset sudden spikes in prices,
such as what we have seen in oil prices over the last six
months, would require a sharp appreciation of the Singapore
dollar. This would disrupt our exporters,"" he said.	
 
 
 INFLATION A GROWING PROBLEM	
 Asian countries are grappling with rising inflation and the
region's central banks are under pressure to tighten monetary
policy to minimise the impact of higher prices. In Singapore's
case, this would mean a stronger local dollar as the central
bank manages policy through the exchange rate.	
 ""What he (Tharman) was alluding to was that the currency
cannot do all the heavy lifting. Clearly there is scope for
other government measures like administrative measures to temper
inflationary expectations,"" said Leong Wai Ho, an economist at
Barclays. 
 Singapore's budget for the financial year starting April 1,
2011 included some reliefs for companies in the budget, such as
enhanced tax rebates for firms that invest to raise
productivity. 
 But these were offset by an increase in employers'
contributions to employee pensions and higher levies on firms
that employ lower skilled foreign workers.	
 Helped by strong economic growth of 14.5 percent last year,
Tharman said Singapore will report a small overall budget
deficit of S$300 million ($235 million) for the financial year
ending March 2011, much smaller than the S$3 billion deficit the
government had originally projected.	
 For the coming financial year ending March 2012, Singapore
expects to post an overall budget surplus of S$100 million,
helped by investment returns of about S$7.8 billion.	
 Singapore's finances are healthier than official numbers
suggest, as proceeds from land sales -- estimated at over S$15
billion in FY2010/11 -- are put directly into reserves and not
reflected as revenue in its annual budgets.	
 Revenues have also been boosted by the opening of two
multi-billion dollar casino-resorts.	
 
 EYE ON ELECTIONS 
 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong must hold general elections
by next February and the government has indicated it will call a
poll in the second quarter.	
 Although the economy is booming and Singapore is one of the
world's richest nations in terms of per capita GDP, Lee's
government must address a widening income gap and worries about
rising inflation, which could hit 5-6 percent year-on-year in
the first quarter of 2011.	
 ""In Budget 2011, we are moving ahead with major measures for
our future to build up a vibrant economy and enable an inclusive
society. Our strong budget also allows us to provide an
additional package of benefits to all Singaporeans this year,""
Tharman said.	
 Lee's People's Action Party has ruled Singapore since
independence and is widely expected to win most of the seats at
the next election.	
 But some analysts warned the benefits of Singapore's strong
economic growth have not percolated evenly through the economy.	
 DBS economist Irvin Seah, for instance, points to government
data showing the average monthly income of the bottom 20 percent
of households had fallen in the 10 years to 2008, even as income
for the top quintile soared by 53 percent over the same period.	
 Tharman, however, said that if data from the past two years
were included, households in the bottom 20 percent also saw
their real incomes increase.	
 There is also the perception that much of the gains from
economic growth has gone to companies and foreigners. The number
of foreigners working in Singapore has soared in the past
decade, and citizens now account for just 3.2 million of the
city-state's total population of 5 million.	
 According to Leong Sze Hian, former president of Singapore's
Society of Financial Service Professionals, the median monthly
income for resident households rose by 3.1 percent, or 0.3
percent after adjusting for inflation, last year, even as the
economy expanded by nearly 15 percent.

flexible and cap the country's current account surplus to help
rebalance the economy, said one of a group of influential Chinese
economists pushing for faster exchange rate reform.
 Calls among Chinese academics for greater yuan flexibility
have been rising, giving added influence to the camp of policy
makers favouring faster currency appreciation to quell inflation.
 ""We believe benefits from yuan reforms have outweighed risks.
The reforms have helped mitigate distortions in exchange rates
and international payments and ease inflation pressure,"" Lu Mai,
secretary general of the China Development Research Foundation,
told Reuters in an interview.
 ""What we should consider is not another one-off revaluation
but how to improve the managed float regime, including widening
the floating band and reinforcing the basket regime.""
 Lu leads a group of economists from the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange and a series of top think-tanks who have
issued an in-depth analysis on the yuan.
 Their work has helped counter a long-held ""misunderstanding""
that a stronger yuan is a plot used by Western countries to
undermine China's economic rise, Lu said.
 The government should shun another one-off yuan revaluation
similar to the one in July 2005, Lu said, but added it should
consider further improvements to the currency regime, including a
wider trading band for the yuan and a more robust currency basket
regime.
 Lu said the yuan's rise would help curb inflation, but he
cautioned against pinning too much hope on monetary policy tools.
 The government should be bolder in yuan reforms because the
currency is under less pressure to rise since it has already
gained nearly 26 percent against the dollar since July 2005, Lu
said.
 The group's report, which was published this week, found that
the yuan's 14 percent rise in 2007 and 2008 cut annual GDP growth
by 0.28 percentage point and cut inflation by 0.42 percentage
point.
 The yuan's rise during that period also reduced China's
current account to GDP ratio by 0.28 percentage points.
 The yuan is now closer to its ""equilibrium"" level, with the
gap narrowing to about 8 percent from as high as 25 percent
before the landmark revaluation in 2005, Lu said.
 In real terms, the gap could be even smaller due to China's
higher inflation relative to that of its key trade partners,
including the United States, Lu said.
 CAP CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS
 It would be in China's own interest to cap its current
account surplus, particularly as the country is trying to rein in
inflation fuelled by capital inflows, Lu argued.
 ""We have proposed that the current account surplus to GDP
ratio should not exceed 5 percent. I think the government will
consider such proposals regardless of what foreigners say,"" he
said.
 China had shrugged off a recent proposal by U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner that current account surpluses should
be limited to about 4 percent of GDP, but analysts say Beijing is
under growing economic pressure to tackle its external excesses.
 Finance ministers from G20 rich and developing countries meet
in Paris on Friday and Saturday, trying to advance an agenda that
aims to identify causes of global economic imbalances and
eventually devise policy remedies to fix them.
 Beijing has vowed to seek a balance in its flow of
international payments, but the country has reported ""twin
surpluses"" in both its current and capital accounts every year
since 1994.
 China's current account surplus fell to 5.1 percent of gross
domestic product last year from 6.0 percent in 2009, down from a
peak of 10.6 percent in 2007, evidence that efforts to spur
domestic consumption and cut its reliance on exports are working.

 * Rising inflation to boost consumption, blunt trade edge	
 * Messy solution, not magic cure, for global imbalances	
 
 By Alan Wheatley, Global Economics Correspondent	
 BEIJING, Feb 18 (Reuters) - It's too early to be sure, but
signs that China's current account surplus will keep shrinking
as a share of national output could draw some of the venom from
the debate on global economic imbalances preoccupying the G20.	
 Imbalances in general and China's exporting clout in
particular remain controversial, even if a brightening global
growth outlook has dampened excited talk of currency and trade
wars.	
 Brazil has joined India in complaining about the yuan's
exchange rate, which the International Monetary Fund, in a
report prepared for a G20 finance ministers' meeting in Paris,
says is still substantially undervalued. 
 But the problem, some economists contend, is at least not
getting worse -- thanks partly to another issue that the Group
of 20 major economies is grappling with: food-driven inflation.	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner makes little
attempt to hide his satisfaction that, because China's inflation
is much higher than America's, the yuan's real exchange rate
against the dollar is rising at around 10 percent a year. That
would translate in time into a major shift in relative
competitiveness.	
 ""In a nutshell I would say that as long as the U.S. is
happy, tensions in the G20 will not increase in any serious
way,"" said Wendy Dobson, co-director of the Institute for
International Business at the University of Toronto's Rotman
School of Management.	
 
 
 Inflation is a second-best solution as it punishes those on
low and fixed incomes, but vested interests stand in the way of
the ideal economic outcome, be it in China or the United States.	
 ""Real RMB appreciation is substantial and the politics in
China of faster nominal appreciation are probably as intense as
the U.S. politics of fast deficit reduction,"" said Dobson, a
former associate deputy minister of finance in Canada.	
 The yuan is also known as the renminbi (RMB).	
 ""Each knows what it has to do and each is moving in the
right direction but much slower than rest of the world would
like,"" she added.	
 
 NOT CONVINCED	
 The IMF's first deputy managing director, John Lipsky, would
certainly like faster action. He warned G20 deputy ministers on
Thursday that global imbalances were in fact likely to worsen.

 In particular, the IMF has warned of the medium-term risk of
a significant rebound in China's current account surplus, which
stood at $306 billion, or roughly 5.2 percent of gross domestic
product, last year, down from a peak of 10.6 percent in 2007.	
 To be sure, according to the Bank for International
Settlements, the yuan's real exchange rate measured against the
currencies of China's main trading partners has actually
depreciated since Beijing abandoned a de facto dollar peg last
June -- hence the ire of Brazil and others.	
 That fact will not be lost on a regular IMF fact-finding
mission due in Beijing next week.	
 Moreover, Derek Scissors, a research fellow with the
Heritage Foundation in Washington, argues that the current
account is an inadequate gauge of the imbalances plaguing China.	
 Because investors anticipating a stronger yuan find ways of
parking money in financial assets, he looks also at China's
surplus on its financial and capital account, which rose to $166
billion last year. 
 Since the People's Bank of China buys most of the foreign
exchange flowing into China to control the yuan's rate of climb,
the central bank's reserves rose by $470 billion in 2010.	
 ""That is a clearly better number to use than the current
account. It does show slower growth from a bigger base, both in
terms of GDP and reserves themselves. But it also modifies the
claim of rebalancing: growth in imbalances has slowed sharply, a
necessary first step but not actual rebalancing,"" Scissors said.	
 
 TRICKY ADJUSTMENT	
 Still, the G20 is leaning heavily towards adopting the
current account as a major benchmark, and many economists are
forecasting a continued decline in China's surplus.	
 Macquarie has pencilled in 4.4 percent for this year and 3.7
percent for 2012; Nomura's forecasts are 4.1 percent and 3.1
percent, respectively. Geithner last year floated an indicative
maximum surplus or deficit of 4 percent.	
 ""At this point, China is clearly helping to rebalance the
world economy in two ways: its import volume is rising
distinctly faster than its by no means sluggish export volume,
and its increased overheating means inflationary pressure that
raises the real effective exchange rate,"" Charles Dumas of
Lombard Street Research in London said in a report.	
 Imports leapt 51 percent in January from the same month a
year earlier, outstripping a 38 percent rise in exports.

 Seasonal factors make the figures impossible to interpret
with confidence, but the buoyancy in imports extends beyond
commodities. China last year became the world's No. 2 importer.	
 German exports to China of luxury cars and top-of-the-line
manufacturing equipment are booming as China raises the quality
of its industrial base, a priority of the five-year plan to be
unveiled next month.	
 As for inflation, the other ingredient in China's
rebalancing, a consensus has formed that a higher rate of around
4 percent is the ""new normal"" in an era of rising food prices
and rapidly accelerating wages for migrant workers.	
 The ruling Communist Party needed no reminder of the perils
of inflation even before the recent spate of revolts in North
Africa and the Middle East. Policymakers are on high alert.	
 But as economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch point
out, inflation also helps the economy adjust: rising wages erode
the competitiveness of labour-intensive exporters and boost
consumption in a way that fiscal policy cannot.	
 China's costs and productivity relative to those of viable
rivals mean it will remain an unbeatable mass manufacturer of
consumer goods, even if the likes of Bangladesh and Cambodia
capture lower-volume runs of low-end textiles.	
 But the message for the world is: get ready for higher
prices from China. In the United States, the cost of apparel
rose 1.0 percent in January, the U.S. Labor Department said on
Thursday.	
 ""The trend of adjustment through higher inflation is likely
to persist for the next several years,"" the BoA Merrill
economists concluded in a report.

Schaeuble signalled readiness to support Portugal if it faces
difficulty in funding itself in financial markets, although he
said it is not in a state of emergency, Japan's Nikkei business
daily reported.
 Schaeuble suggested in an interview with the Nikkei that
Germany would be amenable to further aid for debt-laden euro-zone
members provided they agreed to structural reforms such as
cutting public pensions.
 Portugal is so far managing to fund itself but the cost of
borrowing is now close to or at record highs and is becoming
increasingly punitive.
 The EU has discussed a rescue plan for Portugal but it is
dependent on Lisbon asking for the aid and making the request to
both the EU and the International Monetary Fund. Portugal remains
adamantly opposed to asking for assistance.
 Schaeuble told the Nikkei that Germany has pledged to
demonstrate a sense of solidarity and it must prevent problems
from spreading to Spain.
 Monitoring and limiting excessive capital flows will be high
on the agenda at a meeting this weekend of Group of 20 finance
minsters in Paris.
 Germany and G20 chair France plan to push for tougher
regulations, Schaeuble was quoted as telling the Nikkei.
 Blaming excess liquidity for the global financial crisis
triggered by the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman
Brothers, he stressed the importance of reducing it without
harming growth. The United States is in agreement on getting a
better grasp of capital movements, he said.

 BAC NINH, Vietnam, Feb. 18 (Reuters) - For wood craftsman
Tong Trong Nghia, Vietnam's bold currency devaluation will
likely bring higher costs and squeezed profits.	
 But for some economists, the Feb. 11 move could be a welcome
signal that authorities are getting to grips with woes making
Vietnam -- an investment hotspot when it joined the World Trade
Organisation in 2007 -- slip off the radar of emerging-market
investors. 
 The key is what steps Vietnam takes in the wake of the 8.5
percent devaluation, the biggest since August 1998. The
devaluation, whose magnitude caught the market by surprise, was
widely welcomed for narrowing a gap between the official and
unofficial currency rates.	
 ""Like China, the priority in Vietnam seems always and
everywhere growth,"" said Tim Condon, chief economist for Asia at
ING. Unless the Feb. 11 devaluation is followed by ""some action
to reduce domestic demand and slow import growth, it's a little
hard to see this really having much of an effect,"" he said.	
 Vietnam on Thursday took what analysts say could be its
first action. The State Bank of Vietnam raised what's called the
refinance rate, on short-term loans it offers to domestic banks,
by 200 basis points to 11 percent.	
 But analysts say Hanoi, which did not raise other rates on
Thursday, must take a range of steps to boost low confidence in
its currency, the dong, and cut double-digit inflation.	
 Raising rates is ""certainly necessary"" to try to contain
inflation ""but it is unlikely to be sufficient,"" said Danny
Richards, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit
who watches Vietnam.	
 The consumer price index hit 12.2 percent in January and
many forecast it to remain around that level this year, despite
a government target of 7 percent.	
 Nghia, who has a woodworks shop in Bac Ninh, a city about 30
km (18 miles) northeast of Hanoi, sees pain from the currency's
three-year slide. The 61-year-old imports ironwood, acacia,
sandalwood and other logs from neighbouring Laos but sells its
finished products -- window fames, doors and furniture -- in
Vietnam.	
 As Vietnam's currency, the dong, sheds value, Nghia is
struggling to defray higher costs for logs, especially with
bank-lending rates sky high at about 20 percent a year. 


 
 CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC	
 ""Lower profits are unavoidable,"" said Nghia, who has
operated his woodworks business for 18 years.	
 Some analysts are cautiously optimistic that the devaluation
could spur growth in exports, to help narrow the trade gap,
which grew to $12.4 billion last year and is expected to be
about the same this year. But more broadly, economists are
holding their breath for more evidence that Hanoi is improving
its economic management. 
 When Vietnam joined the WTO, it was a choice
emerging-market investment destination. But lack of coherence in
economic policymaking and a priority on growth alone have led to
imbalances, including in trade, that have scared off many
investors. Last year, all three major ratings agencies -- Fitch,
Standard & Poor's and Moody's -- downgraded Vietnam, citing
macroeconomic imbalances.	
 Most economists agree that Vietnam's growth-obsessed
Communist bosses focussed too much on GDP gains ahead of a
once-in-five years leadership reshuffle in January-- and it cost
them. 
 With little end in sight to high inflation and the
government discussing plans to raise electricity and petrol
prices, many Vietnamese are hoarding dollars and gold, expecting
the dong to lose even more value. In unofficial
markets, the dong has slipped to around 22,000 per dollar, from
about 21,300 before the devaluation.	
 The Feb. 11 devaluation raised the question: What else are
the authorities planning? The government was silent until
Thursday's increase in the refinance rate. 
 
 UNCERTAINTY BEFORE CLARITY	
 With the unofficial dong-dollar languishing outside the
trading band since September, the Feb. 11 devaluation was widely
expected.	
 But the scale and accompanying shift toward more frequent
adjustments of the midpoint rate have been seen as
positive changes, allowing the central bank to protect foreign
exchange reserves and keep bank exchange rates near unofficial
ones.	
 ""It is still too early to say whether the central bank has
made a turn in the way they monitor their policies, but I think
with their adjustments, there is ground for optimism,"" said Vo
Tri Thanh, deputy director of the Central Institute for Economic
Management, a state-run think tank.	
 Optimists say political obstacles have largely been cleared
since the end of the Communist Party's national congress in
mid-January and re-appointment of the prime minister to the
ruling Politburo, paving the way for another five-year term.	
 A new law this year also gives the central bank, in theory,
more independence and a clearer mandate to control prices.	
 However, how the State Bank Law gets implemented is another
matter, especially with the appointment of a new governor on
hold until after May 22 parliamentary elections. ""Uncertainty
will still exist. Then the new governor may come up with a
clearer policy,"" said an economist at an investment firm in
Vietnam.	
 The EIU's Richards said ""tougher measures are needed to
bring down the pace of growth in credit and thereby dampen
demand-driven inflationary pressures."" He and other analysts
said the central bank should consider pushing up banks' reserve
requirements.	
 
 GUESSWORK	
 Investors have struggled to understand monetary policy since
early 2010 when the State Bank of Vietnam de-linked the
benchmark base rate from bank rates. Before last April,
short-term lending rates were capped at 1.5-times the base rate.
    Many economists applauded when the base rate was hiked by
100 basis points in November as a sign of resolve against rising
prices. Higher rates make it more attractive to hold dong,
restoring some confidence and boosting the currency's value.
    Since November, some investors have focused more on steady
increases in the reverse-repurchase rate, although nobody knows
which rate will emerge as the best benchmark. After Thursday's
increase in the refinance rate, some may begin watching that one
more closely, too.	
 ""The bottom line is we shouldn't have to guess what their
policy rate is. That should be very explicit,"" said Matt
Hildebrandt, an economist at JP Morgan based in Singapore.	
 Vietnam's imbalances follow its dramatic economic expansion
from 2000 to 2007, when gross domestic product grew by an annual
average of 7.6 percent and inflation spiralled, peaking at 28
percent in August 2008 -- fueled by years of easy money policies
and aggressive state spending.	
 The domestic overheating caused many investors to flee even
before the global financial crisis hit markets. In 2008, the
year the crisis began, Vietnam kept growing, reporting a 5.3%
rise in GDP. But then weakened exports and wide trade deficits
raised questions over whether underdeveloped Vietnam was relying
too much on overseas markets.	
 At the heart of Vietnam's woes is profligate government
spending, with investment skewed heavily toward inefficient
state-owned enterprises, some say.	
 ""The core problem is a fiscal problem,"" said Jonathan
Pincus, dean of the Fulbright Economics Teaching Program in Ho
Chi Minh City and a former United Nations economist in Hanoi.
""They need to fix that before there's a viable monetary solution
to this problem.""

 BEIJING, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Beijing,
who is sizing up a run for the White House, decried on Friday a
Chinese court for rejecting the appeal of an American jailed on
industrial spying charges.	
 It was the second time in recent days that Jon Huntsman, a
former Republican governor of Utah who will soon leave his job
in Beijing, has sparred with China over rights.	
 ""I'm extremely disappointed in the outcome, although it
wasn't completely unexpected,"" Huntsman said after the court
upheld an 8-year jail sentence U.S. citizen Xue Feng received
last year for arranging the sale of a Chinese oil database.	
 ""We ask the Chinese government to consider an immediate
humanitarian release of Xue Feng, thereby allowing him to get
back to his family and to his way of life,"" Huntsman told
reporters outside the court.	
 Critics say Xue's conviction was unwarranted under China's
vague state secrets laws, and Huntsman and the Obama
administration have repeatedly pressed for his release.	
 ""This case has been brought up in every single meeting that
I've been involved with for almost two years,"" Huntsman said,
referring to dealings between Beijing and Washington. ""We'll not
let this one go.""	
 China maintains the court ruling was properly handed down,
but critics say China's prosecutors and courts often do the
bidding of party officials.	
 Earlier in the week, Huntsman clashed with China over online
censorship. He posted messages on a Twitter-like Chinese
microblog service, asking readers their opinions on a speech by
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about Internet freedom, the
Wall Street Journal reported. 
 His messages were deleted by censors, who often remove text
that questions the wide controls on speech imposed by China's
ruling Communist Party.	
 Huntsman's brother said the ambassador, a fluent Mandarin
speaker who was given his post by President Obama, will decide
within a couple of weeks whether to bid for the Republican
nomination for the 2012 presidential race. 
 Were he to, his positions on China as Obama's envoy are
likely to come under intense scrutiny.	
 Huntsman was involved in the Obama administration's efforts
to steady relations with Beijing after tensions in 2010, when
the two powers argued over Chinese Internet censorship, Tibet,
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, disputed Chinese territorial claims
in the South China Sea and unease over North Korea.	
 In January, Chinese President Hu Jintao made a state visit
to the White House, a summit that both sides said helped to
improve ties, although there were no major policy breakthroughs.	
 Xue, a Chinese-born geologist, was detained late in 2007
after negotiating the sale of an oil industry database to his
employer at the time, Colorado-based consultancy IHS Energy, now
known as IHS Inc.	
 The database was classified as a state secret only after Xue
helped sell it, according to the Duihua Foundation, a U.S.-based
group that promotes prisoners' rights in China.	
 After Xue's conviction last year on charges of attempting to
obtain and traffic in state secrets, the U.S. State Department
said it was extremely concerned about his rights to proper legal
process, and called on Beijing to free him.

 * Dollar/yen subdued after failing to break 84.00
 * Aussie upside seen limited after hitting top-end of range
 By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc held near
two-week highs on Friday, having powered higher on mounting
Middle East tensions, while the U.S. dollar lost steam, putting
its rebound this month from a three-month low at risk.
 The Swiss currency, traditionally sought in times of
heightened geopolitical tension, stayed near two-week highs
versus the dollar and euro as unrest spread across the Middle
East and North Africa.
 Anti-government protesters from Bahrain to Iran were hoping
to emulate those who toppled veteran leaders in Egypt and
Tunisia. [ID:nLDE71G28W]
 The dollar stood at 0.9505 francs , having fallen as
low as 0.9474 francs on Thursday, its lowest in about two weeks,
while the euro fetched 1.2922 francs , having plumbed
1.2890 francs on Thursday, also a two-week low.
 The dollar was also broadly weaker against a basket of major
currencies as U.S. bond yields declined slightly and expectations
of a Federal Reserve rate hike failed to gain momentum.
 A surprisingly large increase in initial jobless claims
signalled wages were unlikely to pick up any time soon, reducing
expectations of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year.
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's performance
against a basket of major currencies, dipped to a one-week low of
77.921 before edging back to 78.001 <.DXY>.
 It has broken below a channel support line connecting its
three-month low on Feb. 2 and lows on Feb. 9-10, suggesting its
recovery from the Feb 2. low is at risk.
 Immediate support comes in at 77.88, the 50 percent
retracement of the Feb. 2 to Feb. 14 rise, a break of which could
open the way for a test of the Feb 2. low of 76.881.
 LITTLE FROM G20?
 ""As long as the dollar index holds above the Feb 2. low, it
will be in a holding pattern,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist
at Sumitomo Trust and Banking, adding that the dollar's fate
hinges on Fed policy in the long run.
 The Fed's chief, Ben Bernanke, will be speaking in Paris at
1300 GMT on Friday ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministers
and central bankers on Friday and Saturday.
 Traders expect little from the G20 meeting.
 ""I don't think the upcoming G20 meeting will produce many
market-moving factors, so currencies are expected to stay in
current ranges,"" said Masanari Takada, foreign exchange
strategist at Nomura Securities.
 The euro touched a one-week high of $1.3629 .
 ""You could attribute some of the euro's gains to lower U.S.
yields,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank,
 ""But objectively speaking, it's difficult to justify the
euro's spike as there aren't too many supportive factors for the
currency at the moment. Some players were squaring positions
ahead of the U.S. three-day weekend,"" he added.
 The dollar also lost momentum against the yen. The greenback
traded at 83.35 yen , having fallen to 83.15 on Thursday,
well off an eight-week high near 84 yen hit on Wednesday.
 Traders said heavy offers from Japanese exporters as well as
repatriation of earnings by Japanese companies ahead of their
financial year-end next month could block the dollar in the 84-85
yen area.
 But some speculators and leveraged funds are still caught in
yen long positions and if they unwind those positions that could
help the dollar break through those resistance levels, said Osamu
Takashima, chief Japan FX strategist at Citibank.
 Broad weakness in the dollar and ongoing strength in
commodity prices helped to keep the Aussie near a one-week high.
It traded at $1.0125 , near Thursday's one-week high of
$1.0131.
 But some market players are concerned that the currency is in
for a correction after a strong rally since the middle of last
year.
 ""The market was well short the Aussie with less liquidity in
New York ahead of the long weekend. But now that we're at the
high end of the range, I'd look to play from the short side,"" a
trader at a U.S. investment bank said.
 Recent U.S. data showed long Australian dollar 
positions have jumped to the highest level since April 2010.
[IMM/FX]
 Back then, the Aussie traded sideways for much of the month
but subsequently fell more than 12 percent and touched its lowest
level of the year in May.
 Some market players think a lot of good news is baked into
the current exchange rate and the weight of positions may start
to impact the currency. [nL3E7DG0GU]

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Asian stocks are set to finish
their best week in two months on Friday as fading concerns over
inflation encouraged investors to hunt for value in beaten down
markets within the region.	
 In the currency markets, the Swiss franc a
safe-haven, held near two-week highs versus the dollar and euro
as unrest spread across the Middle East and North Africa.

 Indonesian and Indian stocks , which were
pummelled last month, saw some bargain-buying this week, while
Japanese and Australian shares succumbed to a
bout of profit-taking after posting solid gains.	
 Seoul recovered smartly after dropping nearly 2
percent in the past three sessions due to a rally in
shipbuilders including Daewoo Shipbuilding .
.	
 The MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
rose by more than 1 percent, extending its
weekly gains to nearly 3 percent, its best week since December.	
 Regional stocks hit a two-month low last Friday.	
 The region's shares and bonds sold off heavily last month as
investors fled to the relative safety of developed U.S. and
Japanese markets because of inflation concerns, but there are
signs that the sell-off may be drawing to a close.	
 Asia equity ETF redemptions slowed to just $55 million last
week after averaging $369 million in the previous three weeks,
while local buying in India was the biggest since late 2009,
data from Trim Tabs Investment Research showed.	
 Japan has been the best performing market in Asia so far
this year, having gained some 6 percent, making it ripe for some
profit-taking.	
 ""It's an obvious breather after the market has gained so
much recently,"" said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex
Inc.	
 ""The time for such a break is perfect, because investors
want to re-adjust their positions according to what happens in
the Middle East, with the G20 summit and after a longer market
break in the U.S.,"" he said.	
 In the emerging markets space, halfway through the first
quarter of 2011, India, Philippines and South Africa have led
the losers, according to Thomson Reuters data.

 TREASURIES UP	
 Safe haven buying lifted U.S. Treasuries, with the 10-year
benchmark yield falling to 3.59 percent, below a
10-month peak of 3.77 percent marked last week. .	
 This week's drop has also calmed concerns that a relentless
rise in U.S. yields would narrow the yield differentials with
emerging market bonds and trigger further selling.	
 Ten-year yields are up by 120 basis points since October.	
 Foreigners have resumed buying Indonesian local debt after
heavy selling last month as the central bank's rate rise offered
some reassurance about its inflation fighting credentials.	
 As a result, net foreign ownership climbed to a new record
and sent the rupiah soaring to a 3-1/2 year high.	
 Softer Treasury yields have also weighed on the U.S. dollar.	
 Asian currencies received a leg up from China's move to
guide the yuan to a record high before this weekend's
G20 meeting. 
 U.S. crude futures for March delivery were trading
above the $86 per barrel mark while ICE Brent crude for April
delivery were trading around $103 levels. .	
 Gold looked set to build on this week's hefty gains
above the 1380 an ounce line.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 New York, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc
gained broadly on Thursday, lifted by Middle East tensions,
while the dollar struggled, partly pressured by the decline in
U.S. Treasury yields and technical factors.
 The franc, traditionally sought during periods of
geopolitical tension, will likely remain firm against other
currencies if events in the Middle East escalate. The dollar,
on the other hand, may continue to weaken, as investors
consolidate recent gains racked up against the yen and euro.
 Popular unrest in Bahrain, Libya and Yemen as well as
concerns about Iranian warships transiting the Suez Canal have
fostered uncertainty among international investors in recent
days. For details, see
 ""The outperformance of the Swiss franc seems to reflect
safe-haven flows owing to Middle East/North Africa tensions,""
said David Watt, senior fixed-income and currency strategist at
RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro was down 0.7 percent at
1.2917 francs, while the dollar was down 1.0 percent at 0.9493
francs. The franc has gained 1.8 percent against the dollar so
far this year, but slipped 0.6 percent this month.
 Key technical support for the euro/Swiss franc pair was
broken at 1.3005, the 21-day moving average and base of the
Bollinger band. Technicians target 1.2815 as the next bear
objective and see 1.2896 as support.
 This is the 38.2 percent retracement of the rally from
1.2398 record lows to the 1.3205 high from last Friday. Strong
support should emerge around this region, an analyst said.
 Euro/Swiss franc one-month volatilities fell on Thursday,
although risk reversals continued to move in favor of Swiss
franc calls, with the one-month 25-delta around 1.40 compared
to a neutral bias at the start of the year.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, meanwhile, fell 0.3 percent
to 77.974, trading below key resistance at 78.701, the index's
100-day moving average.
 Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital
in Toronto, said the dollar index did get above the 100-day
moving average this week but failed to hold above that, and its
failure suggested that the dollar's bias is downward.
 The currency market also kept an eye on U.S. Treasury
yields, which fell on Thursday as bonds got a bid on Middle
East concerns. Two-year Treasury yields tumbled below 0.8
percent and are again near the Feb 7 level 0.765 percent.
Ten-year Treasury yields were also down, but remain above
support from mid-December at 3.534 percent.
 Treasury yields have been on an uptrend in recent sessions
amid higher inflation expectations, lending support to the
greenback. On Thursday, that dynamic was not present.
 A myriad of U.S. economic data, meanwhile, weighed on
financial market sentiment. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve
said U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity improved sharply in
February. U.S. inflation and weekly claims for jobless benefits
came in higher than expected.
 The euro was last up 0.2 percent at $1.3605.
 Spain and France sold a combined 11.87 billion euros of
debt at auctions, which analysts said fared well, with a
longer-dated Spanish bond notably attracting good bids as it
looked cheap on the Spanish curve.
 The Spanish auction helped pull the euro off a session low
versus the dollar, though the fragility of the euro-zone
banking sector was highlighted by a jump in emergency overnight
borrowing at the European Central Bank.
 The dollar fell against the yen for a second straight day
and was last trading at 83.33 yen, down 0.4 percent, but has
gained 1.5 percent so far this month.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2011 05:16PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China says pressure will not affect yuan's rise," * Foreign pressure has never been important consideration
 * Zhou reiterates pledge to keep yuan flexible
(Adds quotes, background)
 PARIS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - China's central bank governor
Zhou Xiaochuan said on Thursday that Beijing will decide the
pace of the appreciation of the yuan on its own and would not
take into account pressure from other countries.
 Ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central
bankers in Paris this week, India and Brazil have joined the
United States in voicing concern about the slow speed of the
yuan's appreciation, saying it was hurting their exports
.
 ""External pressure has never been an important factor of
consideration and we have never paid special attention to it,""
Zhou said on the sidelines of the G20 gathering.
 ""We mostly depend on our judgement ... to adjust the yuan's
value independently,"" he added. ""We do not pay too much
attention to whether external pressure is great or not.""
 ""From our own independent point of view, for the sake of
developing our own financial markets ... we need to reform the
system and make it more flexible,"" he said.
 The complaints from India and Brazil are awkward for
Beijing, which is accustomed to facing U.S. pressure over its
tightly controlled exchange rate but has tried to cast itself
as a natural ally of other developing nations.
 In response to international pressure for the yuan to rise
quicker, China has always vowed to make the currency more
flexible -- giving it more leeway to move.
 But Beijing has pledged that the yuan should only climb at
a gradual rhythm so as not hobble its own export sector.
 Many in the market expect the yuan to rise by around 5
percent this year. Yet with rising prices at home, economists
say China has more reason to let appreciation gather speed to
curb imported inflation.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc and
U.S. government bonds rallied on Thursday, while crude oil
prices rose as unrest in the Middle East and tensions between
Israel and Iran escalated.
 U.S. stocks, however, shrugged off concerns about the
Middle East as investors bought on early dips. World equities
measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>,
hit more than 2-1/2 year highs.
 Bahrain police stormed a square in Manama, killing at least
three people as protests in the Middle East and North Africa
gathered pace. Clashes were also reported in Libya, while at
least 40 were wounded in Yemen in demonstrations against the
president's 32-year rule.
 Iranian state TV said on Thursday two Iranian warships are
due to pass through the strategic Suez Canal in a move that
Israel has called a ""provocation.""
 ""All in all, the pace of change sweeping the region is
truly mind-boggling,"" said Edward Meir, senior commodity
analyst at brokers MF Global.
 The U.S. dollar fell 1 percent to 0.9496 Swiss franc
, while the euro dropped 0.7 percent to 1.2921 franc
.
 ""If events in the Middle East do escalate we will see safe
haven flows which will help the Swiss franc,"" said Kenneth
Broux, market economist at Lloyds.
 Benchmark ten-year U.S. Treasury notes  last
traded up 18/32 in price to yield 3.58 percent, down from 3.62
percent late on Wednesday.
 Unrest spreading across the oil-rich Middle East and North
Africa stoked fears of a disruption of oil flows.
 U.S. crude futures  ended higher for a second
straight day, after trading as high as $86.50. Brent crude for
April delivery  earlier climbed above $104 a barrel,
before retreating.
 Gold, also a safe-haven, rose for a fourth day, its longest
winning streak since September. Spot gold  hit a
five-week high at $1,384.65 an ounce.
 STOCKS STILL IN DEMAND
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended up 29.97
points, or 0.24 percent, at 12,318.14. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 4.11 points, or 0.31 percent, at
1,340.43. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 6.02
points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,831.58.
 Wall Street stocks earlier came under pressure after the
United States reported the fastest rise in core consumer prices
in more than a year in January. But bargain hunters quickly
rushed in and pushed the index back near multi-year highs.
 The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes volatile food
and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent last month after a 0.1
percent rise in December, the Labor Department said. It was the
largest increase since October 2009.
 ""We've run up incredibly over the last six months, and many
many onlookers are looking for a pullback, and it just refuses
to come,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 European shares <.FTEU3> closed at a new 29-month high for
the fourth straight day. The MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> hit its highest level since the end of July
2008 and last traded up 0.61 percent at 347.03.
 The euro edged higher versus the dollar as solid demand at
a Spanish debt auction offset broader euro zone banking and
sovereign debt concerns. It last traded up 0.3 percent at
$1.3606 .
