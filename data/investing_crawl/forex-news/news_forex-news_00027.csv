 NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc and
U.S. government bonds rallied on Thursday, while crude oil
prices rose as unrest in the Middle East and tensions between
Israel and Iran escalated.
 U.S. stocks, however, shrugged off concerns about the
Middle East as investors bought on early dips. World equities
measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>,
hit more than 2-1/2 year highs.
 Bahrain police stormed a square in Manama, killing at least
three people as protests in the Middle East and North Africa
gathered pace. Clashes were also reported in Libya, while at
least 40 were wounded in Yemen in demonstrations against the

 Unrest spreading across the oil-rich Middle East and North
Africa stoked fears of a disruption of oil flows.
 U.S. crude futures  ended higher for a second
straight day, after trading as high as $86.50. Brent crude for
April delivery  earlier climbed above $104 a barrel,
before retreating.
 Gold, also a safe-haven, rose for a fourth day, its longest
winning streak since September. Spot gold  hit a
five-week high at $1,384.30 an ounce.
 STOCKS STILL IN DEMAND
 Wall Street stocks earlier came under pressure after the
United States reported the fastest rise in core consumer prices
in more than a year in January. But bargain hunters quickly
rushed in and pushed the index back near multi-year highs.
 The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes volatile food
and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent last month after a 0.1

 By Julie Haviv
 New York, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar declined
broadly on Thursday as Middle East tensions boosted the appeal
of other safe-haven currencies, with technical factors seen
working in favor of a stronger Swiss franc.
 Popular unrest Bahrain, Libya and Yemen as well as concerns
about Iranian warships transiting the Suez Canal have fostered
uncertainty among international investors in recent days.
 The Swiss franc, traditionally sought as a safe-haven
during times of geopolitical tension, will likely continue to
strengthen against other currencies if events in the Middle
East escalate.
 ""The Swiss franc is doing well as Middle East tensions are
weighing on the market a bit,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
research at GFT Forex in New York.
 The euro was down 0.7 percent against the Swiss franc at
1.2931 francs, while the dollar was down 0.9percent at 0.9504
francs.
 Key technical support for the euro/Swiss franc was broken
at 1.3005, the 21-day moving average and base of the Bollinger
band. Technicians see 1.2815 as the next bear objective and
1.2896 as support.
 This is the 38.2 percent retracement of the rally from
1.2398 record lows to the 1.3205 high from last Friday. Strong
support should emerge around this region, an analyst said.
 A myriad of U.S. economic data, meanwhile, weighed on
financial market sentiment. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve
said Mid-Atlantic business activity improved sharply in
February while U.S. inflation and weekly claims for jobless
benefits came in higher than expected.
 GFT Forex's Lien said the data could be interpreted as good
for global risk appetite.
 ""We've had hawkish comments from the BoE (Bank of England)
and RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia), and even if the Federal
Reserve ends its asset purchase program in June, we're reminded
that it will still be one of the last central banks to raise
interest rates,"" she said. ""So good U.S. data is good for the
U.S. economy, but better for countries with far less spare
capacity.""
 The euro was last up 0.3 percent at $1.3602 dollars.
 George Davis, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said a short-term resistance comes in at
$1.3615.
 ""That's the most relevant level on the topside and if we
close above it, the euro has the potential to extend toward
$1.3745,"" he said. ""On the downside, $1.3484 is trend line
support, and at a minimum, we would have to take that out to
cause an acceleration.""
 The dollar fell against the yen for a second straight day
and was last down 0.5 percent at 83.20 yen.
 Michael Woolfolk, managing director at BNY Mellon Global
Markets in New York, noted that inflation is not strictly an
overseas phenomenon.
 ""Today's slate of Fed speakers will have ample opportunity
to comment on their views of emerging inflationary risks,"" he
said. ""Higher rate expectations will prove dollar positive only
to the extent they rise faster than European rate
expectations.""
 The Federal Reserve has justified its decision to keep
interest rates at record lows by pointing to high unemployment
and excessively low inflation.
 U.S. Treasury prices extended gains after the inflation
data. Federal funds futures for January 2012 delivery touched a
session high.
 Spain and France sold a combined 11.87 billion euros of
debt at auctions which analysts said fared well. The Spanish
auction helped pull the euro off an earlier session low against
the dollar, though the fragility of the euro zone banking
sector was highlighted by a jump in emergency overnight
borrowing at the European Central Bank.

 * IMF says global imbalances growing, risk of overheating
 * France's Lagarde says favours freer yuan exchange rate
 
 (updates with details of preparatory meeting)
 By Abhijit Neogy and Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Officials of the G20 differed on
Thursday over how to measure imbalances in the global economy on
the eve of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of
the world's leading economies.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde lowered
expectations, saying G20 countries would have made major
progress if they clinch a preliminary accord in Paris on what
measures they will use to benchmark and address mismatches that
could trigger a future financial crisis.
 ""This is something which is highly debated at the moment and
will be in the next couple of days, because some countries do
not want to be identifiable as doing such and such a policy,""
Lagarde told an Institute of International Finance conference.
 ""We will already have taken a big step forward if we get an
agreement in principle ... on the elements that allow us to
measure imbalances.""
 A source familiar with the discussion reported differences
at a preparatory meeting of deputy finance ministers and top
officials over whether to use indicators on the balance of
payments, trade, real exchange rates and currency reserves.
 China, under fire from the United States and other developed
economies for keeping its exchange rate low, told the meeting
that the International Monetary Fund's judgement on that the
yuan is substantially undervalued was wrong, the source said.
 In a report prepared for the ministers, the IMF warned that
global economic imbalances have increased and were likely to
grow further unless policies changed, and said there was a risk
of emerging market economies overheating.
 It also said the world economy faces growing risks from
surging food prices and battered public finances in developed
countries, and advocated a somewhat weaker dollar, according to
the document obtained by Reuters.
 Some G20 delegates said Lagarde's objective of reaching
agreement in Paris on an initial short list of indicators seemed
unrealistic. 
 France proposed including the current account deficit, real
exchange rate and currency reserves in the initial list, the
source at the preparatory meeting said.
 China and Germany were dragging their feet because they did
not want to be singled out in future for running excessive
current account surpluses, delegates said.
 ""I don't think we can have benchmarks ready by April. I
think a more realistic deadline could be the October ministerial
meeting, but the Paris communique would perhaps mention this
action plan,"" one G20 delegate from an emerging country said.
 The United States and France consider it vital to have
agreement on a set of indicators by mid-year so that guidelines
can be agreed later in the year for coordinated global economic
policies to reduce dangerous imbalances.
 Other issues on the French G20 agenda include greater
transparency and regulation of commodities prices and a reform
of the international monetary system.
 
 PRESSURE ON YUAN
 Lagarde, who will host the two-day Group of 20 meeting from
Friday evening, said she also favoured a freer exchange rate for
China's yuan -- the focus of heated debate between Beijing and
Washington on currencies and their impact on trade balances.
 Mexican central bank governor Agustin Carstens, addressing
the same conference, said the world economy would benefit if
Asian economies all had flexible exchange rates.
 ""In the case of Asian economies, flexible exchange rates are
what needs to take place,"" he said.
 China has resisted U.S.-led pressure for an early and
significant appreciation of the yuan, preventing the G20 from
making any reference to its currency, but has allowed its
exchange rate to rise gradually since last June.
 This week's meeting will showcase debate on French President
Nicolas Sarkozy's ambitious agenda for his G20 stewardship,
which at its launch in November included proposals to curb food
and fuel price volatility and gradually reduce the world's
dependence on the dollar.
 Amid divisions over plans to regulate commodities markets
and redraw the monetary system, France is pinning its hopes on
nailing an accord on measuring imbalances in the world economy,
where the G20 nations account for around 85 percent of GDP.
 The IMF report prepared for the meeting said a two-speed
world economic recovery had taken hold, posing contrasting
problems for policymakers in developing and developed nations.
 ""External imbalances as we see it have now increased and are
likely to grow further,"" IMF deputy managing-director John
Lipsky told a preparatory meeting of G20 deputies. ""I may say
that static policies will lead to even higher imbalances.""
 
 GLOBAL BALANCE IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST
 Lagarde said earlier that economic imbalances had been
redressed somewhat during the major downturn of recent years but
were growing again as the economy recovered.
 ""That can't go on too long ... As is often the case with big
imbalances, a system collapses,"" she told France Info radio.
 The big picture of imbalances was a world where China saved
and exported, Europe consumed and the United States borrowed and
consumed, and this was where the G20 needed to make progress to
make sure there was an element of equilibrium, she said.
 ""We can start towards that with these indicators,"" she told
France Info.
 ""It can also be addressed through monetary channels, by
seeing to it for example that the Chinese currency is not as
controlled as it is now and that it also becomes an
international, convertible, floating currency, as are most
currencies in developed countries.""
 G20 countries have been working for some time on ways of
working together to correct mismatches in the global economy
following the worst downturn since World War Two but have yet to
reach agreement on the starting point -- which indicators they
should base such policy decisions on.

 * Gbagbo's government seen as becoming desperate for cash
 
 By Ange Aboa
 ABIDJAN, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's cocoa regulator
said on Thursday it would recover export taxes from companies
for the cocoa in their warehouses, even if Western sanctions
prevent them from exporting it.
 It also said there were still around 300,000 tonnes of cocoa
left to come out of farms in the 2010/11 season, which can go
nowhere while European Union and U.S. sanctions prevent
shipping.
 The figure includes the mid-crop from April to September.
 But while acknowledging that sanctions meant exporters could
not sell their cocoa, Coffee and Cocoa Management Committee
president Gilbert Anoh said they would be forced to pay export
duties on it regardless.
""The exporters will pay their taxes, I tell you,"" Anoh told
Reuters in an interview.
 ""By March 31 we will recover all royalties from the cocoa in
warehouses. Whether or not it gets exported, it will be paid.""
 The cocoa industry in the world's top grower is slowing to a
halt due partly to EU and U.S. measures imposed on Gbagbo to
starve him of funds and partly to the collapse of the banking
system, which has dried up liquidity.
 The EU has barred all EU companies from doing business with
Ivorian institutions seen backing Gbagbo -- such as the cocoa
regulator and the ports -- after he refused to step down
following a disputed Nov. 28 poll that the electoral commission
said he won. A pro-Gbabgo legal body reversed the result.
 Similar measures are in place in the United States.
 Ouattara, internationally recognised as president elect but
unable to take power, called for a one-month cocoa ban in
January month that he is expected to renew on Feb. 23.
 Anoh said this was not the reason for slower exports.
 ""It's not the intervention of Ouattara stopping exports but
the ban imposed by the EU,"" he said. ""The maritime embargo
prevents exporters from operating (and is) stopping ships
coming.""
 Exporters have stopped registering new beans for export and
have stopped buying beans up-country. This has led to a collapse
of farmgate prices to around half their pre-crisis levels.
 ""The ones who are suffering are the farmers, who worked all
year and now can't sell their cocoa,"" Anoh said. ""We have
revised our estimate (of the remaining crop on farms) to 300,000
tonnes by the end of September. This is what worries us.""

 NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc and
U.S. government bonds rallied on Thursday, while oil prices

 Unrest spreading across the oil-rich Middle East and North

 Worries about Middle East unrest weighed on U.S. stocks
earlier, although bargain hunters quickly rush in and pushed

 * U.S. had called for real negotiations
 
 (Adds more quotes, background, details, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The long-running Doha trade talks
have finally started to move after a constructive week of talks
among key powers that grappled with issues of substance, the
U.S. envoy to the World Trade Organization said on Thursday.
 The comments, by U.S. ambassador Michael Punke, were one of
the strongest signs yet that an intensified push to conclude the
decade-old negotiations this year were finally bearing fruit.
 ""My sense is that we're finally starting to do the things we
need to do, which is grapple with the really hard issues,""
Punke told Reuters after a week of meetings among 11 major WTO
members including the United States.
 ""We're in a mode right now where we're talking about
substance.""
 Negotiators have been meeting over the past few weeks since
trade ministers called last month in Davos for an outline deal
by the middle of July, and said they would tell negotiators to
do what it takes to reach necessary compromises.
 The meetings this week of the 11 economies known as G11 --
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, India,
Japan, Mauritius, South Africa and the United States -- are part
of those intensified efforts.
 Punke said the United States had held bilateral meetings
with every other member of the group. Whether the renewed push
would actually produce a deal was uncertain but everyone was
committed to intensifying the talks and pushing on.
 
 ""LITTLE NEW""
 But the diplomat chairing negotiations on the crucial
agriculture sector said two weeks of consultations and meetings
had generated little new.
 ""We are losing one day every day,"" New Zealand ambassador
David Walker told a meeting of the WTO's 153 members, reminding
them that the April 21 deadline for a new draft negotiating text
was fast approaching.
 Walker said he was aware some countries were working among
themselves on solutions to some of the more contentious issues.
 Brazil floated a proposal at the G11 talks for groups of
countries to agree to eliminate duties in some agricultural
sectors, beyond any general cuts in tariffs agreed by all
members -- the mirror image of a proposal in industrial goods
backed by the United States, Japan and the EU but which emerging
countries are suspicious of.
 The idea found little support, diplomats said, and some
questioned whether it was a delaying tactic as the appreciation
of the real has made Brazil uneasy about opening its market for
industrial goods any further under a deal.
 The Doha talks were launched in late 2001 to open up global
commerce and help poor countries prosper through trade. But they
became deadlocked after a push in July 2008 to reach a deal
foundered over disagreement on measures to protect farmers in
poor countries from destabilising floods of imports and the plan
to eliminate duties in some industrial sectors.
 The United States -- the key to any deal -- has long argued
that major powers, especially the big emerging economies like
Brazil, China and India, need to move beyond declared positions
and get involved in real negotiations of give and take to give
the talks a chance of succeeding.
 Former top WTO official Stuart Harbinson said negotiators
now appeared to have got the message from leaders.
 ""I've not seen this level of activities in terms of the
number and frequency of the meetings before. The pressure is
certainly being put on the negotiators to deliver,"" he told a
briefing in Washington.

 * Urges more decisive action to solve euro zone debt crisis#
 * Says some depreciation of dollar would help

(Adds details, combines stories)
 PARIS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund
will warn G20 finance ministers this weekend of growing risks to
the world economy from surging food prices and public finances
while also advocating a somewhat weaker dollar.
 The Fund's report to a two-day meeting starting on Friday,
pointed to rising bond yields as a key risk to the U.S. fiscal
outlook and global growth, and said the euro zone needed to take
more comprehensive steps to deal with an ongoing debt crisis. 
 The report, entitled Global Economic Prospects and Policy
Challenges, warned that a two speed rebound in the world economy
is underway, posing a problem to policy makers trying to shore
up recovery following the financial crisis.
 ""The global economic recovery is advancing. However the
recovery remains uneven, with downside risks in advanced
economies remaining elevated while overheating risks are growing
in emerging economies,"" it said.
 The paper, obtained by Reuters, said the real exchange rates
of several emerging economies' currencies, particularly Brazil
and South Africa are ""looking increasingly overvalued"".
 It said some depreciation of the dollar would help support
more balanced world growth and reiterated that China's yuan was
substantially undervalued in real effective terms.
 ""Some further real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar
would help ensure a sustained decline of the U.S. current
account deficit towards a level more consistent with medium term
fundamentals, helping to support more balanced growth,"" the
report said.
 The fund raised its forecast for oil prices this year to
$94.75 a barrel from a forecast just last month of $89.50,
following tensions in the Middle East, and said the social
unrest in the area also risked driving up global food prices.
 It warned that tensions in peripheral euro zone countries
pose ""significant risks to recovery in the region and possibly
beyond,"" and called on euro zone policy makers to adopt a more
comprehensive approach to area's debt crisis.
 ""This will require decisive action on an expedited basis,""
it said, as backstops put in place by the European Central Bank
and the euro zone bail out fund (EFSF) are not sufficient.
 In advanced economies, high unemployment and large output
gaps are keeping wages and inflation in check, notwithstanding
large increases in food and energy prices, meaning accommodative
monetary policies remain appropriate, the report said.
 However, quantitative easing in the United States could
result in a flood of capital, it warned, adding that this has
not so far been borne out by recent data.
 The United States and Japan should both make more progress
with medium term fiscal consolidation, it said.

 * Sources say Greencore in talks with private equity firms 

(Adds analyst, Northern Foods comment, shares) 
 By Matt Scuffham and Simon Meads 
 LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Ireland's Greencore is talking
with private equity firms with a view to securing support for a
new offer for Northern Foods, sources familiar with the
situation told Reuters.
 Northern Foods, which makes Fox's biscuits and Goodfella's
pizza, agreed last month to back a bid worth 73 pence per share
from businessman Ranjit Boparan, valuing the business at 342
million pounds ($552 million) and trumping an all-share offer
from Greencore.
 Greencore has said it is reviewing its options and sources
said it is now seeking a private equity partner to part-fund a
higher offer, possibly including a cash element.
 ""They are trying to find a creative way to consummate a
deal,"" one of the sources told Reuters on Thursday, countering
reports that Greencore might soon walk away.
 Northern Foods on Wednesday appointed ex-Cadbury executive
Alan Williams as its finance director, leading to speculation it
could be giving up on the deal as its original offer had
proposed Northern Foods Finance Director Simon Herrick would
take the same role in the merged entity.
 Brewin Dolphin analyst Michael Vassallo said there is
interest among private equity for deals in the sector -- citing
Blackstone's recent buyout of Spain's Mivisa.
 ""There's definitely a bit of appetite out there. Private
equity are always interested in good food companies and there
have been deals recently but it would have to be pitched at a
good price to dissuade investors (away from Boparan offer),""
Vasallo said. 
Greencore and Northern Foods declined to comment.
 Shares in Northern Foods, which had been flat on the day,
rose to 74.75 pence, 2.4 percent above the offer price, by the
close of trade.

 NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. and European shares fell
on Thursday after the United States reported
higher-than-expected inflation and jobless claims, while the
Swiss franc extended a prior session rally on concerns about
Middle East tensions.
 U.S. core consumer prices rose at their quickest pace in
more than a year in January, though some economists said the
increase was not strong enough to suggest a troubling build-up
in inflation pressures.
 ""The rise in CPI wasn't that huge, but in this environment
everyone is hyper-sensitive to any inflation,"" said T.C.

 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index

 The political tensions boosted the appeal of safe-haven
assets such as the Swiss franc and U.S. government debt.
 The U.S. dollar was down 1 percent at 0.9497 Swiss francs

 ""If events in the Middle East do escalate we will see safe

 Unrest spreading across the oil-rich Middle East and North

 By Julie Haviv
 New York, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc rallied
sharply against rival currencies on Thursday as Middle East
tensions lifted its safe-haven appeal, but the euro gained
after solid Spanish debt auction.
 Unrest in Yemen and Bahrain and concern about Iranian
warships using the Suez Canal have fostered uncertainty among
investors.
 The Swiss franc is traditionally sought as a safe-haven
during times of geopolitical tensions. If events in the Middle
East escalate safe haven flows should further buoy the Swiss
franc.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was down 0.6 percent at
1.2936 francs, while the dollar was down 0.8 percent at 0.9520
francs.
 Key technical support for the Euro/Swiss franc was broken
at 1.3005, the 21-day moving average and base of the Bollinger
band. Technicians target 1.2815 as the next bear objective and
see 1.2896 as support.
 This is the 38.2 percent retracement of the rally from
1.2398 record lows to the 1.3205 high from last Friday. Strong
support should emerge around this region, an analyst said.
 Euro/Swiss franc one-month volatilities fell on Thursday,
although risk reversals continued to move in favor of Swiss
franc calls, with the one-month 25-delta around 1.40 compared
to a neutral bias at the start of the year.
 Meanwhile, U.S. inflation and weekly claims for jobless
benefits came in higher than expected.
 Michael Woolfolk, managing director at BNY Mellon Global
Markets in New York, said inflation is not strictly an overseas
phenomenon.
 ""Today's slate of Fed speakers will have ample opportunity
to comment on their views of emerging inflationary risks,"" he
said. ""Higher rate expectations will prove dollar positive only
to the extent they rise faster than European rate
expectations.""
 The Federal Reserve has justified its decision to keep
interest rates at record lows by pointing to high unemployment
and excessively low inflation.
 U.S. Treasury prices extended gains after the inflation
data.. Federal funds futures for January 2012 delivery touched
a session high.
 The euro was last up 0.3 percent at $1.3606 dollars.
 George Davis, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said a short-term resistance comes in at
$1.3615.
 ""That's the most relevant level on the topside and if we
close above it, the euro has the potential to extend toward
$1.3745,"" he said. ""On the downside, $1.3484 is trend line
support, and at a minimum, we would have to take that out to
cause an acceleration.""
 The dollar fell against the yen for a second straight day
and was last at 83.26 yen, down 0.5 percent.
 Spain and France sold a combined 11.87 billion euros of
debt at auctions which analysts said fared well, with a
longer-dated Spanish bond notably attracting good bids as it
looked cheap on the Spanish curve.
 The Spanish auction helped pull the euro off a session low
versus the dollar, though the fragility of the euro zone
banking sector was highlighted by a jump in emergency overnight
borrowing at the European Central Bank.
 ""The Spanish government sold the debt, but there are
concerns about the increased overnight borrowing at the ECB,""
said Gavin Friend at nabCapital.
 The euro and other major currencies remained trapped in
ranges. Expectations that spot prices will not move too far in
one direction or the other pushed euro/dollar implied
volatility to 10.7 percent its lowest level since September.

20,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2011 10:44AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-France lowers sights for G20 indicators deal," * 'Mismatches' indicators to be focus of debate in Paris
 * IMF says global imbalances growing, risk of overheating
 * Lagarde says favours freer yuan exchange rate
 
 By Daniel Flynn and Abhijit Neogy
 PARIS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - G20 president France lowered
expectations on Thursday of a deal on how to measure imbalances
in the global economy when finance ministers and central bankers
of the world's big economies meet this weekend.
 On the eve of the talks, the International Monetary Fund
warned that global economic imbalances have increased and were
likely to grow further unless policies changed, and said there
was a risk of emerging market economies overheating.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said G20 countries
will have made major progress if they clinch a preliminary
accord in Paris on what measures they will use to benchmark and
address mismatches that could trigger a future financial crisis.
 ""This is something which is highly debated at the moment and
will be in the next couple of days, because some countries do
not want to be identifiable as doing such and such a policy,""
Lagarde told an Institute of International Finance conference.
 ""We will already have taken a big step forward if we get an
agreement in principle ... on the elements that allow us to
measure imbalances.""
 Some G20 delegates said her objective, already reduced from
France's initial ambitious agenda, seemed unrealistic.
 China and Germany were dragging their feet because they did
not want to be singled out in future for running excessive
current account surpluses, the delegates said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
 While there is broad agreement on indicators such as public
deficits and debt levels, reference to real exchange rates and
foreign exchange reserve levels is more controversial.
 ""I don't think we can have benchmarks ready by April. I
think a more realistic deadline could be the October ministerial
meeting, but the Paris communique would perhaps mention this
action plan,"" one G20 delegate from an emerging country said.
 The United States and the IMF consider it vital to have
agreement on a set of indicators by mid-year so that guidelines
can be agreed later in the year for coordinated global economic
policies to reduce dangerous imbalances.
 Other issues on the French G20 agenda include greater
transparency and regulation of commodities prices and a reform
of the international monetary system.
 Lagarde's remarks came amid concern that differences of
opinion within the Group of 20 may prevent finance ministers
from reaching agreement at the meeting on a five-item list of
indicators on which to base judgments on whether countries
should alter economic policy to redress imbalances.
 
 PRESSURE ON YUAN
 Lagarde, who will host the two-day Group of 20 meeting from
Friday evening, said she also favoured a freer exchange rate for
China's yuan -- the focus of heated debate between Beijing and
Washington on currencies and their impact on trade balances.
 Mexican central bank governor Agustin Carstens, addressing
the same conference, said the world economy would benefit if
Asian economies all had flexible exchange rates.
 ""In the case of Asian economies, flexible exchange rates are
what needs to take place,"" he said.
 China has resisted U.S.-led pressure for an early and
significant appreciation of the yuan, preventing the G20 from
making any reference to its currency, but has allowed its
exchange rate to rise gradually since last June.
 This week's meeting will showcase the debate on President
Nicolas Sarkozy's ambitious agenda for his G20 stewardship,
which at its launch in November included proposals to curb food
and fuel price volatility and gradually reduce the world's
dependence on the dollar.
 Amid divisions over plans to regulate commodities markets
and redraw the monetary system, France is pinning its hopes on
nailing an accord on measuring imbalances in the world economy,
where the G20 nations account for around 85 percent of GDP.
 An IMF report prepared for the G20 meeting said a two-speed
world economic recovery had taken hold, posing contrasting
problems for policymakers in developing and developed nations.
 ""External imbalances as we see it have now increased and are
likely to grow further,"" IMF deputy managing-director John
Lipsky told a preparatory meeting of G20 deputies. ""I may say
that static policies will lead to even higher imbalances.""
 
 GLOBAL BALANCE IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST
 Lagarde said earlier that economic imbalances had been
redressed somewhat during the major downturn of recent years but
were growing again as the economy recovered.
 ""That can't go on too long ... As is often the case with big
imbalances, a system collapses,"" she told France Info radio.
 The big picture of imbalances was a world where China saved
and exported, Europe consumed and the United States borrowed and
consumed, and this was where the G20 needed to make progress to
make sure there was an element of equilibrium, she said.
 ""We can start towards that with these indicators,"" she told
France Info.
 ""It can also be addressed through monetary channels, by
seeing to it for example that the Chinese currency is not as
controlled as it is now and that it also becomes an
international, convertible, floating currency, as are most
currencies in developed countries.""
 G20 countries have been working for some time on ways of
working together to correct mismatches in the global economy
following the worst downturn since World War Two but have yet to
reach agreement on the starting point -- which indicators they
should base such policy decisions on.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2011 10:44AM ET</span>",Environment lobbyists hopeful of WTO fish deal," * Outlines of fisheries deal emerging
 * Fuel subsidies key; fuel is 2/3 of fleet costs
 * State of fish stocks continues to deteriorate
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Environmental activists are
hopeful that negotiations at the World Trade Organization to
curb fisheries subsidies, especially those on fuel, can produce
a deal that will help end overfishing.
 Agreement would not only help reverse the alarming depletion
of global fish stocks and contribute to a broader trade deal in
the WTO's long-running Doha round, but would provide a template
for tackling global problems such as climate change that have a
trade dimension.
 Despite big differences over the scope of a deal and which
countries should be exempted from which provisions, the outlines
of an agreement are already emerging,"" Peter Allgeier, former
long-serving U.S. ambassador to the WTO, told Reuters after two
weeks of talks on fishing as part of a renewed push on Doha.
 ""You've got a structure there,"" Allgeier, who now heads the
trade consultancy arm of law firm Crowell and Moring, and is
advising Oceana, an advocacy group fighting for ocean
conservation, said on Thursday.
 WTO members are all agreed that they have a mandate to
impose trade disciplines on fishing subsidies, which will
involve prohibitions of some support, he said.
 They accept that the way to do this is to agree prohibitions
and then work out exceptions and flexibilities for suitable
cases, and that fuel subsidies will be a central part of a deal.
 
 OVERFISHING
 In its latest two-yearly survey of fishing last month, the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said that 85
percent of fish stocks are now fully exploited, over-exploited,
depleted or recovering from depletion, a figure that has
deteriorated steadily in recent years.
 ""If current trends continue the world's fisheries could be
beyond recovery within decades, within our lifetime,"" Oceana's
senior campaign director, Courtney Sakai, told Reuters.
 One of the main reasons for this over-fishing is that many
countries subsidise uneconomic activities, such as long-distance
deep-sea fishing, where fuel amounts to two thirds or more of
the operating costs of a fishing fleet.
 Every country accepts the need to curb or prohibit these
subsidies -- but each one also argues its own arrangements are
special and should be exempt. But Trinidad's WTO ambassador,
Dennis Francis, who chairs the talks on fishery subsidies and
other trade rules, has challenged WTO members to subject each
other's programmes to scrutiny.
 ""Everybody has got to figure out how they are going to
discipline their fuel subsidies,"" said Allgeier. ""You just can't
have a situation where some are allowed to do it and some
aren't... Everybody's got to give.""
 Another faultline in the talks is whether the emphasis
should be on fair trade or the environment.
 Japan says that bringing trade considerations into the
talks, even though they are at the WTO, is a distraction and
they should focus on resource management and conservation.
 But Allgeier said there is a clear trade dimension.
 Subsidies in industry hurt a competitor by depriving them of
market share or profits but do not stop them from manufacturing.
Fisheries subsidies are different.
 ""If I'm subsidising my fishing fleet I'm actually taking
away from you your resource base,"" he said.
 Developing countries insist that their small-scale and
subsistence fishermen should be exempt from any restrictions on
subsidies, and Sakai said it was reasonable for poor countries
to help under-developed coastal communities with infrastructure
and other support to build viable, self-sustaining industries.
 Japan has also proposed that small-scale fishing in
developed countries should enjoy similar waivers from
restrictions, but other countries such as the United States,
New Zealand and Mexico say this would open too many loopholes.

 By Gus Trompiz
 PARIS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Eramet is to double investments
this year to benefit from booming demand from emerging countries
and the French mining group said it preferred to go it alone,
dampening speculation of a tie up with Areva.
The company expects to make around 9 billion euros in
industrial investment over the 2011-2020 period, including 600
million euros this year, Chief Executive Patrick Buffet said on
Thursday after his group swung back to profit in 2010.
 ""We envisage a sharp acceleration in our expansion and are
aiming to almost double industrial investments in 2011 to cover
modernisation and organic growth, as well as to pursue major
transformational projects,"" he told a news conference.
 The CEO said Eramet had the means to pursue its development
alone and did not see the benefit of a tie-up with the uranium
mines of state-owned nuclear group Areva, an idea floated by
French officials.
 Eramet preferred to continue cooperating in specific areas
with companies including Areva, which is also Eramet's
second-largest shareholder, he said.
 ""It is better to have two champions that are leaders in
their markets and who cooperate, rather than a single group that
is forced to split up part of its activities,"" Buffet said.
 He said he not been contacted about a potential tie-up.
 Shares in Eramet were down 3 percent to 268.35 euros by 1343
GMT, having fallen sharply after Buffet's comments on Areva.
 
 ACQUISITIONS
 The group is confident that growth from emerging economies,
led by China, would continue to drive demand for its metal ore
and alloys, although the CEO was cautious about volatility
partly due to a shift by big miners towards short-term pricing.
 ""We are driven to a large extent by this demand from
emerging countries in terms of construction, urbanisation and
industrialisation,"" said Buffet, who declined to set earnings
goals, only citing a ""favourable"" outlook for early 2011.
 A global economic rebound fuelled demand for nickel and
manganese ore last year, which are mainly used in stainless and
carbon steel respectively.
 The firm's alloys division saw a pick-up in the fourth
quarter supported by increased orders from aircraft
manufacturers, Eramet said.
 Eramet's solid financial position gave it the scope to
pursue targeted acquisitions, with the potential for 1-1.5
billion euros in deals in the next two years, over and above its
industrial investments, Buffet said.
 Areas of interest included manganese acquisitions in South
Africa and deals to extend alloy production to low-cost and
dollar-zone countries, Buffet added.
 The group's big projects include the Weda Bay nickel deposit
Indonesia, which Eramet is exploring in partnership with Japan's
Mistsubishi Corp.
 The company, which is due to decide by the end of 2012
whether to go ahead with the mining project, said it was looking
at developing production of 35,000 tonnes of nickel capacity in
a first phase compared to estimated potential of 65,000 tonnes.
 The new site could in future double the group's nickel
output. Its production is currently based in New Caledonia,
where the company aims to increase output to 65,000 tonnes in
2014 from 57,000 tonnes seen this year.
 Eramet posted a full-year current operating income of 739
million euros ($1 billion), versus an operating loss of 163
million euros in 2009 and the average forecast of 681 million
from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of analysts.
 It plans a 94-percent dividend increase to 3.50 euros a
share.

 An 18-year veteran of the largely London-based kidnap and
ransom insurance industry, his job is to help his firm's clients
manage the business of hostage negotiation, literally bargaining
for lives with suitcases of cash.
 In some ways, it is a process that traders, litigators and
shoppers are familiar with. It is all about finding the price
range, talking down the seller's expectations and closing a deal
with kidnappers who can be as professionals as the negotiators.
 ""It's not exactly haggling,"" Chase told Reuters in the
iconic glass and metal Lloyd's of London building, centre of
Britain's insurance industry and home to his employer, risk
advisory firm AKE. ""Everyone usually knows what the market price
really is. It's about arriving at it in a believable way.""
 But that can take months -- a long, awkward process in which
negotiators like Chase must deal with traumatised families and
worried employers, jumpy gunmen and interfering officials.
 ""You have extreme emotion and stress, particularly with
families,"" Chase says. ""You have to manage that. Knowledge and
experience is a comforting thing. But you learn every time.
Things happen you couldn't make up.""
 The Canadian-born former intelligence officer is one of only
a few dozen ""K&R"" specialists working for a handful of firms on
behalf of insurance and reinsurance companies.
 Most K&R consultants are ex-military, intelligence or
law-enforcement but Chase says all that is needed is a cool
head, ability to cut a deal and work in difficult circumstances.
 Sometimes they go into the field to broker a deal, sometimes
-- particularly with piracy -- they spend time in a client
firm's operations room, managing negotiations from there.
 The insurance sector began writing specific K&R policies in
the late 1970s. Buyers now range from resource to media firms,
aid groups and, increasingly, shipping companies wanting
protection against growing Somali piracy. 
 
 RANSOM SAFER THAN RESCUE
 One insider estimates that it generates $500 million in
premiums a year, with most recent growth in the marine sector.
 As more ships have been hijacked, ransoms have grown and so
have the procedures for negotiation. Ships' captains may have a
telephone number to call and prearranged codes to confirm the
crew remain alive.
 The method of ransom delivery is usually the same:
waterproof containers of cash dropped by air into the water
after a light aircraft has circled the ship while the hostages
line up on deck to be counted by the K&R team.
 But kidnap patterns change constantly. Mexico provides a
growing caseload, while other one-time hotspots such as Colombia
and Iraq appear in decline, at least temporarily. Meanwhile,
there is always some work in Europe and North America.
 Critics say paying ransoms perpetuates the kidnap industry.
But holding hostages for ransom has been a tactic of
governments, warlords and militants throughout history. K&R
insiders say ultimately paying up is the most reliable way of
getting someone back alive.
 Chase says teams he has been involved with have only ever
lost two hostages. They have got back hundreds alive.
 One was a hostage in Latin America who was killed while
trying to escape. Another was amongst dozens executed in Iraq in
retaliation for the hanging of Saddam Hussein.
 That contrasts with the much higher risks in the event of an
attempted military rescue, with the danger of a hostage death
sometimes estimated as high as 50 percent.
 ""As soon as people start shooting, it gets dangerous and
unpredictable,"" Chase says. ""It is something you really want to
avoid. There are just too many cases of it going wrong.""
 
 DIFFERENT NATIONAL APPROACHES
 One such fatality was Scottish aid worker Linda Norgrove,
taken hostage in Afghanistan last year and killed by a grenade
thrown by U.S. special forces rescuers.
 Different governments take different approaches to
hostage-taking. The United States, insiders say, tends to favour
the military rescue option. European governments are more likely
to pay up, although France increasingly takes a more aggressive
approach, particularly with al Qaeda-linked abductions.
 British officials condemn hostage-takers to a ""long and
boring wait"". They will not pay ransoms themselves but have
largely not blocked others from doing so, except when payment
would fund militancy or breach anti-terror laws.
 Legal efforts to block ransoms to militants are a perennial
problem for hostage negotiators, Chase says.
 When authorities tell them ransom payment would be illegal,
negotiators usually pull back for 24 hours. ""Then we go back to
the authorities and tell them ... they are endangering the
hostages' lives,"" he says. ""Without exception, they end up
allowing us to continue.""
 Very occasionally, he says, negotiators find themselves
facing kidnappers who have no interest in cash. But even for
those with a political agenda, kidnapping is primarily a revenue
generation tool.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2011 09:04AM ET</span>","FACTBOX-Main issues, impact of EU-S.Korea trade deal"," Feb 17 (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers approved an
EU-South Korean free trade agreement expected to double the
value of trade in goods between them to about 100 billion euros
($135 billion).
 Below are estimates of the impact, caveats and environmental
concerns of the accord, which is set to take effect in July. 
 
 DUTY CUTS
 The agreement will eliminate 1.6 billion euros in Korean
import duties annually for EU exporters of industrial and farm
products and about 1.1 billion euros in EU duties.
 
 NON-TARIFF BARRIERS
 In areas such as the automotive, pharmaceutical and consumer
electronics sectors, South Korea will consider EU standards as
equivalent to its own, cutting red tape that has hampered trade.
 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 The pact provides for improved enforcement of copyright and
anti-piracy measures, protecting the exclusivity of EU food and
drink names such as Champagne, Scotch whisky and Parma ham.
 
 DISPUTE SETTLEMENT
 Trade disputes will be fast-tracked to 120 days, faster than
typical settlement procedures in the World Trade Organization.
 
 FOREIGN CONTENT
 A fought-over part of the pact is how much foreign content
-- such as Chinese-made parts -- to allow in Korean goods. Korea
can export cars with 45 percent foreign input.
 However, a ""duty drawback"" clause can force Korea to limit
duty refunds to its manufacturers if the EU finds a surge in
Korean imports made with foreign parts, and vice versa.
 
 TARIFF CUTS ON CARS
 This is one of the most contentious parts of the accord,
with widespread concern among European and Japanese carmakers
alike that cheap Korean cars will flood EU markets.
 The EU and Korea will eliminate import duties on large and
medium cars over three years and on small cars over five years.
 
 SAFEGUARDS
 In the case of a significant import surge, the executive EU
Commission can reimpose an import duty on cars for two years,
with an option to renew duties for two-year periods.
 Safeguards must be requested case-by-case by EU governments
or European industry and can apply to limited market segments.
 They can be blocked by a weighted majority of EU states.
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
 South Korea has eased car emissions standards for big cars,
largely imported from the EU. A two-tonne car may now emit up to
193 grams of CO2 per kilometre instead of 184 grams.
 Hailed by the EU as a victory for free trade, Korea's
consent has raised concerns of a precedent in making
environmental standards vulnerable to accusations of trade
protectionism.

 * Import duties to be eliminated on 98 percent of products

(Adds quote from Seoul)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The European Parliament
approved a free-trade pact between the European Union and South
Korea on Thursday, clearing the way for the EU's largest
bilateral trade deal to take effect from July.
 Lawmakers voted 465 to 128, with 19 abstentions, in favour
of the deal, backing an accord that is expected to double the
value of trade in goods between the parties to around 100
billion euros ($135 billion) a year.
 The pact aims to eliminate 98 percent of import duties --
1.6 billion euros of South Korean duties and 1.1 billion euros
of EU duties -- as well as trade barriers in manufactured
goods, agricultural products and services over the next five
years.
 The European Union is the world's largest trading bloc, with
total gross domestic product of $16 trillion. South Korea is the
world's 15th largest economy, according to the International
Monetary Fund.
 ""It is the most ambitious free-trade agreement signed by the
European Union and it becomes a blueprint for future trade
agreements with emergent countries, such as India,"" Socialist
lawmaker Bernd Lange said after the vote.
 The EU's trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, was equally
upbeat: ""This is a landmark agreement and a benchmark for what
we want to achieve with other key trading partners,"" he said.
 South Korea welcomed the European Parliament's vote.
 ""The government hopes that our parliament can also speedily
complete the ratification process so that the agreement can take
effect on July 1 as planned,"" South Korea's foreign ministry
said in a statement.
 
 GREEN TRADE-OFF
 Lawmakers also approved separate legislation that will act
as a brake on surging imports from South Korea.
 The so-called safeguard clause was key in securing backing
for the accord. It allows EU industry and governments to request
a re-imposition of duties if surging imports hurt EU producers.
 Concerns of EU car makers, particularly those in Italy, were
at the heart of the negotiations, which started in 2007. South
Korea decided to ease domestic rules on CO2 emissions for cars,
benefiting large vehicles mainly imported from the EU.
 Hailed as a victory for free trade by the European Union,
South Korea's move has prompted concerns of a precedent that
will make environmental laws vulnerable to accusations of
protectionism between trading partners.
 ""The EU is and will be involved in free trade agreements
with many countries around the world. It should be careful not
to class these countries' climate legislation as a non-tariff
barrier since this could expose it to similar pressures with
regards to the EU's own laws,"" said Franziska Achterberg, policy
adviser for Greenpeace.
 South Korea is also negotiating a free-trade pact with the
United States.

 * CEO Dougan says ahead in transition to new Swiss standards

(Adds Credit Suisse statement with bond details)
 By Matthew Attwood and Jane Merriman
 LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse found growing
mainstream investor appetite for so-called CoCos when issuing
another $2 billion of the bonds which boost a bank's capital by
converting into equity if it runs into trouble.
 The Swiss bank is pioneering contingent capital bonds
favoured by banking regulators. Earlier this week, it sold
another to two Middle Eastern investors.
 Thursday's second bond sale gave another boost to a market
regulators are keen to see grow, with banks using CoCos to
cushion losses and reduce the risk of taxpayer-funded bailouts.
 ""We have, for some time now, supported the advent of
contingent capital in Switzerland and we are pleased to
contribute in this practical way to international debate on its
role and feasibility,"" Credit Suisse chief executive Brady
Dougan said.
 Together, the two Credit Suisse deals are a positive sign
for the nascent market for CoCos, which had initially received a
cool reception from traditional fixed income investors, many of
whom are not able to hold equity.
 Switzerland has encouraged its two biggest banks -- UBS and
Credit Suisse -- to issue the bonds to meet tougher capital
rules after the credit crisis.
 Dougan said he was ""pleased to have successfully completed
this next step in our capital plan to transition to the new
Swiss regulatory standards well ahead of time"".
 The group said it had already secured more than 70 percent
of its maximum potential issuance of this type of capital under
the proposed Swiss regulations.
 Before Credit Suisse, only British lender Lloyds Banking
Group and Dutch group Rabobank had issued types of CoCos.
 Credit Suisse's latest deal was marketed to investors in
Asia and Europe. The bonds offered a 7.875 percent coupon.
 Demand appeared to be good, attracting orders of around $22
billion, according to fixed income market sources.
 Credit Suisse plans to raise about 6 billion Swiss francs
($6.3 billion) by offering cornerstone shareholders Olayan Group
and Qatar Holding CoCos in exchange for hybrid securities.
 The CoCo issue converts to ordinary shares if Credit
Suisse's consolidated risk-based capital ratio was below 7
percent at the end of any calendar quarter.
 They can also be converted if Swiss regulators decide that
the bank ""requires public sector support to prevent it from
becoming insolvent, bankrupt or unable to pay a material amount
of its debts, or other similar circumstances"".
 Credit Suisse said the latest CoCos were expected to carry a
BBB+ rating from Fitch and be listed on the Euro-MTF exchange.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The euro steadied versus the
dollar on Thursday, with solid demand at a Spanish debt auction
offset by broader euro zone banking and sovereign debt concerns,
while concern about Middle East tensions lifted the Swiss franc.
 Spain and France sold a combined 11.87 billion euros of debt
at auctions which analysts said fared well, with a longer-dated
Spanish bond notably attracting good bids as it looked cheap on
the Spanish curve. [ID:nLDE71G0Z7] [ID:nLDE71GOSE]
 The Spanish auction helped pull the euro off a session low
versus the dollar, though the fragility of the euro zone banking
sector was highlighted by a jump in emergency overnight
borrowing at the European Central Bank. [ID:nLDE71G0I6]
 ""The Spanish government sold the debt, but there are
concerns about the increased overnight borrowing at the ECB,""
said Gavin Friend at nabCapital.
 He added that banking sector concerns should be enough to
prevent the euro rising above resistance around $1.3625. Euro
sentiment came under pressure earlier this week due to
uncertainty over rescue plans for German lender WestLB.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.3555
, off a session low of $1.3537 when it broke below
reported stop loss orders at $1.3550. Support was seen above the
100-day moving average at $1.3539.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro  was down 0.4
percent at 1.2965 francs, while the dollar was down 0.2 percent
at 0.9569 francs .
 Middle East concerns helped the Swiss franc move beyond 1.30
francs per euro as investors sought safe havens, though analysts
said a continued rise in stocks suggested that investors'
aversion to risk was limited.
 ""If events in the Middle East do escalate we will see safe
haven flows which will help the Swiss franc, but equities are
still holding up for now,"" said Kenneth Broux, market economist
at Lloyds.
 Investors kept an eye on spreading anti-government protests
after Bahraini police stormed a protest camp on Thursday, while
tensions in the Middle East were underlined by plans -- later
cancelled -- for Iranian warships to sail through the Suez
Canal. [ID:nLDE71G00E] [ID:nLDE71G0CU]

signs of whether U.S. inflation is ticking up, after Federal
Reserve minutes suggested policymakers were in no hurry to shift
an ultra-loose monetary policy [ID:nN16297279]
 The euro and other major currencies remained trapped in
ranges. Expectations that spot prices will not move too far in
one direction or the other pushed euro/dollar implied volatility
to 10.7 percent  its lowest level since September.
 ""Vols are suggesting that there is unlikely to be a range
break any time soon,"" said nabCapital's Friend.
 Euro/Swiss franc one-month volatilities  fell on
Thursday, although risk reversals continued to move in favour of
Swiss franc calls, with the one-month 25-delta 
around 1.40 compared to a neutral bias at the start of the year.
 Options analysts said selling demand from hedge funds drove
euro/franc implied vols lower, adding that a move in the spot
price closer to 1.30 francs earlier this week had increased such
demand.

 * Criticises BoE's reliance on output gap measures
 * Says rates need to rise faster than markets expect
 
 (Adds market, analyst reaction)
 By Christina Fincher and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Bank of England rate-setter
Andrew Sentance made his most outspoken attack yet on the
central bank's economic forecasts on Thursday, saying they
understated inflation risks and the need for a rate hike.
 The long-standing hawk, who has voted for higher interest
rates since last June, highlighted the divisions on the BoE's
Monetary Policy Committee and made clear his growing frustration
with the central bank's poor track record on forecasting
inflation.
 Sentance's criticism set him on a collision course with BoE
Governor Mervyn King who on Wednesday warned markets not to get
ahead of themselves in pricing in monetary tightening.
""My judgement is that the upside risks to inflation are
understated in the published fan charts. And monetary policy
would most likely need to be tightened faster and by more than
the markets currently expect to bring inflation back to target,""
Sentance told a conference in London.
 Sterling rose as investors saw the remarks as a further sign
that King may be losing the centre of gravity on the nine-member
committee.
 Simon Hayes, UK economist at Barclays, said the substance of
Sentance's speech was not new but the tone was ""arguably more
assertive"" in emphasising the growing rifts on the MPC.
 Sentance was joined by MPC newcomer Martin Weale in voting
for a rate hike in January, and there is speculation that
minutes from this month's meeting, due next week, will show that
others joined them.
 
 MPC RIFT
 Quarterly forecasts published by the BoE on Wednesday
suggested inflation would subside to 1.7 percent on a two-year
horizon if interest rates were to rise to 1 percent by the end
of this year.
 Sentance made clear he did not agree with this assessment
and criticised the BoE's reliance on calculations of the output
gap -- something many economists believe can never be accurately
gauged -- in its assessment of future price pressures.
 He said a number of indicators suggested the degree of spare
capacity in the economy was smaller than after previous
recessions and argued that the small, open nature of Britain's
economy meant monetary policy needed to be set in a global
context.
 ""This tendency to overweight the downward pull of spare
capacity in the UK economy and underweight the upward impact of
external inflationary pressures has resulted in big upside
inflation forecast errors over a number of years,"" he said.
 ""And it also underpins the over-optimistic assessment of the
medium-term inflation outlook in the current set of forecasts
published yesterday.""
 Inflation has been above the BoE's target for most of the
past five years, yet the central bank appears reluctant to
change its forecasting process.
 Money markets show investors expect the BoE to raise rates
by a quarter-point in the first half of this year, with at least
one further hike by December.
 UK interest rates have stood at a record low of 0.5 percent
since March 2009, a level Sentance believes is no longer
justified given inflation pressures and a steady global
recovery.
 One of the advantages of raising interest rates now would be
a rise in the value of the pound, Sentance said. This would help
offset the rising cost of imported commodities, which have
helped drive inflation to double the BoE's 2 percent target.
 ""The value of the pound on the foreign exchanges therefore
needs to be one of the key areas of focus for the
MPC as we seek to steer ourselves out of the current phase of
high inflation,"" he said.

(Adds fresh quote, G20 source)
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - G20 countries will have made major
progress this weekend if they clinch a preliminary accord on what
measures they will use to benchmark and address mismatches in
the world economy, France's economy minister said on Thursday.
 Christine Lagarde, who will host the two-day Group of 20
meeting starting later on Friday, said she also favoured a freer
exchange rate for China's yuan -- the focus of heated debate
between Beijing and Washington on currency valuations and their
impact on trade balances.
 Her remarks came amid concern that differences of opinion
within the Group of 20 may prevent finance ministers from
reaching agreement at the meeting on a five-item list of
indicators on which to base judgments on whether countries
should alter economic policy to redress imbalances.
 Lagarde told an Institute of International Finance
conference that France, G20 president this year, hoped a list of
indicators could be agreed so that guidelines could be set to
help make world growth more stable.
 ""This is something which is highly debated at the moment and
will be in the next couple of days, because some countries do
not want to be identifiable as doing such and such a policy,""
Lagarde said.
 ""We will already have taken a big step forward if we get an
agreement in principle ... on the elements that allow us to
measure imbalances.""
 This week's meeting will showcase the debate on President
Nicolas Sarkozy's ambitious agenda for his G20 stewardship,
which at its launch in November included proposals to curb food
and fuel price volatility and gradually reduce the world's
dependence on the dollar.
 Amid divisions over plans to regulate commodities markets
and redraw the monetary system, France is now pinning its hopes
on nailing an accord on measuring imbalances in the world
economy, where the G20 nations account for around 85 percent of
GDP.

 GLOBAL BALANCE IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST
 Lagarde said economic imbalances had been redressed somewhat
during the major downturn of recent years but were growing again
as the economy recovered.
 ""That can't go on too long ... As is often the case with big
imbalances, a system collapses,"" she said earlier on France Info
radio.
 The big picture of imbalances was a world where China saved
and exported, Europe consumed and the United States borrowed and
consumed, and this was where the G20 needed to make progress to
make sure there was an element of equilibrium, she said.
 Regarding China's exchange rate, which is closely guided by
the state, Lagarde said it was in everyone's interest to ensure
a global balance.
 ""We can start towards that with these indicators,"" she told
France Info.
 ""It can also be addressed through monetary channels, by
seeing to it for example that the Chinese currency is not as
controlled as it is now and that it also becomes an
international, convertible, floating currency, as are most
currencies in developed countries.""
 G20 countries have been working for some time on ways of
working together to correct mismatches in the global economy
following the worst downturn since World War Two but have yet to
reach agreement on the starting point -- which indicators they
should base such policy decisions on.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a 30-month high
on Thursday, driven by strong corporate earnings and cautious
optimism on the U.S. economy from the Federal Reserve, while oil
prices eased after hitting a 28-month high the previous day.
 Unrest spreading across the oil-rich Middle East and North
Africa had pushed London Brent crude prices to a multi-month
high of $104.52 a barrel, but they dipped 0.2 percent on
Thursday although the market remained volatile.
 The political tensions also helped boost the appeal of
safe-haven assets, with the Swiss franc gaining ground while
yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries eased.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a mixed opening on Wall
Street with futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both down 0.1
percent by 1104 GMT while the Dow Jones futures were up by the
same margin.
 Robust earnings and merger activity have boosted global
equities recently. Data from Thomson Reuters StarMine showed
three quarters of U.S. companies met or beat market expectations
for earnings in the fourth quarter.
 ""Many people are still optimistic about the market because
the global economy is doing well and earnings for large U.S.
companies have been quite good,"" said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein,
equity markets strategist at Deutsche Postbank in Bonn.
 Adding to positive sentiment, minutes from the U.S. Federal
Reserve's Jan. 25-26 policy session showed officials raised
their forecasts for economic growth last month, though they
still expected slow progress in reducing unemployment.
 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
rose 0.3 percent, hitting their highest level since August 2008.
 The index has risen 4.6 percent so far this year, but its
valuations remain modest against a 10-year average. The MSCI
global index has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings of 12.5
times against a 10-year average of 14.8, Thomson Reuters
Datastream shows.
 The MSCI emerging market index was up 0.3 percent, though it
is down 3.5 percent for the year as many investors have been
shifting out of booming developing markets on concerns over
inflation.
 
 EMERGING MARKETS
 However, some remain positive on emerging market equities.
 ""Emerging markets earnings remain solid and there are
reasons to expect they will improve relative to developed
markets,"" Citigroup said in a note. ""Emerging market relative
valuations are at their lowest level since 2008. The pullback
provides an opportunity to buy.""
Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 added 0.1 percent, aided by
forecast-beating earnings from Swiss food group Nestle and
computer consultantcy Capgemini. In Asia, Japanese shares gained
0.3 percent, up for the fourth straight session to a 9-1/2 month
closing high.
 Copper prices, however, continued to lose steam, falling for
the third straight session. They were down 0.9 percent after
hitting a record high on Monday with traders saying high prices
above $9,000 a tonne were cutting off some demand.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 0.9560 Swiss francs,
while the euro fell 0.3 percent to 1.2977 francs.
 ""If events in the Middle East do escalate we will see safe
haven flows which will help the Swiss franc, but equities are
still holding up for now,"" said Kenneth Broux, market economist
at Lloyds.
 The dollar was largely steady against a basket of major
currencies.
 Persistent concerns about the euro zone's ability to tackle
its debt crisis continued to weigh on the euro.
 However, yields fell at a Spanish debt auction -- seen as a
test of investor sentiment towards debt-laden euro zone
sovereign issuers -- allaying fears the euro zone periphery
would find it hard to issue long-term debt in tough market
conditions.

 COPENHAGEN, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The private equity owners of
Danish outsourcing group ISS plan to raise around 13.3 billion
Danish crowns ($2.41 billion) via a share offering in Europe's
biggest IPO this year so far if it goes ahead.
 Last month, ISS' owners Goldman Sachs and Swedish buyout
firm EQT broke off talks on an $8.5 billion takeover by private
equity firm Apax on disagreement over price.
 Investors had believed the owners aim was to exit the
business, but Thursday's announcement said the flotation
involved new shares and would pay down debt.
ISS, one of the world's biggest private-sector employers with
more than 500,000 workers, said the offering, which would have
ranked number three in Europe last year, would re-introduce the
group on the Copenhagen bourse.
 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been appointed joint
global coordinators, ISS said in a statement.
 ""The contemplated IPO is expected to support ISS' future
growth and operational strategy, advance the company's public
and commercial profile,"" ISS said.
 The issue would also improve access to capital markets, it
said.
 The Copenhagen share market saw several private
equity-backed flotations last year, swallowing the $2.1 billion
IPO of Danish jewellery maker Pandora and a $2.2 billion
re-listing by telecoms group TDC in the fourth quarter -- two of
Europe's biggest equity offerings of 2010.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2011 05:04AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China MofCom studies import tax cuts -sources," BEIJING, Feb 17 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Commerce has
asked for opinions from other ministries about the idea of
cutting import taxes on a range of goods including food
supplies, two sources familiar with the move said on Thursday.	
 Speculation of which import duties could be cut reverberated
through prices of various commodities on domestic and overseas
exchanges - particularly for soy and palm oil which both fell on
the talk of the possible duty cuts.	
 One of the sources, an official who had seen a MofCom
document sent out after the Lunar New Year holiday earlier this
month, said MofCom was hoping to encourage imports of resources
and hi-tech goods that China lacks. 
 But details are still being discussed by the various
ministries and the final plan would need to get the go-ahead
from China's cabinet before it could become reality, the source
said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity.	
 Officials from China's commerce and finance ministries
declined to comment.	
 China, the world's largest soybean buyer and No.2 vegetable
oil importer, is among several nations in Asia and the Middle
East struggling to tame inflation rates stoked in part by rising
food prices. 
 
 SPECULATION ON IMPORT CUTS HIT SOY, PALM OILS	
 Soyoil prices on China Dalian exchange fell more than 1
percent <0#DBY:> in response to the duty cut speculation. China
crushes a significant portion of soybeans imported and produced
domestically to make soyoil. If import duties on soybeans or
soyoil were cut, it would likely dampen domestic prices. 
 Separately Malaysian palm oil futures fell 2 percent on
fears that palm oil would be excluded from and import tax cuts.

 ""The market is talking about a large cut in the import
tariff on soyoil, which may lead to more imports,"" said Wu
Huasong, an analyst with Dongxing Futures based in Shanghai.	
 Dealers said the market was also reacting to reports by a
number of industry web sites speculating what might be cut,
including the influential Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Ltd. -
www.chinajci.com	
 JCI cited a trader in Singapore as saying that China may cut
the soy import tax to 1 percent from 3 percent and that the
soyoil import tax would be cut to 5 percent from 9 percent.	
 Traders reached by Reuters could not confirm the reduction.	
 Some traders linked the possibility of the cut in the soy
import tax to the situation in 2008 when Beijing temporarily cut
the tax to 1 percent amid concerns about rising food inflation.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The euro eased slightly against
the dollar on Thursday, weighed down by euro zone banking and
debt concerns, while the Swiss franc gained as worries about
Middle East tensions boosted safe haven flows into the currency.
 The euro turned lower against the dollar after Moody's
rating agency placed German bank Commerzbank on review for
possible downgrade after earlier reported sovereign buying had
propped up the single currency. Investors were also wary
ahead of an auction of Spanish debt, while figures from the
European Central Bank showing emergency overnight borrowing
jumped to more than 15 billion euros, a 20-month high increased
concerns about the problems facing the euro zone.
 Fresh tensions between Israel and Iran continued to rattle
markets already spooked by spreading anti-government protests in
the Middle East after Israel's foreign minister said on
Wednesday that two Iranian warships planned to sail through the
Suez Canal.
 However, an official said on Thursday that the Suez Canal
has been told that these plans to use the waterway were
cancelled.
 Middle East concerns helped the Swiss franc move back below
1.30 francs per euro as investors sought safe havens, though
analysts said a continued rise in stocks suggested that
investors' aversion to risk was limited.
 ""If events in the Middle East do escalate we will see safe
haven flows which will help the Swiss franc, but equities are
still holding up for now,"" said Kenneth Broux, market economist
at Lloyds.
 The euro was down 0.17 percent against the dollar at $1.3543
, having hit a session low of $1.3537 after breaking below
reported stop loss orders at $1.3550. Support was seen above the
100-day moving average at $1.3539.
 While persistent buying by sovereign players below $1.35 is
seen supporting the euro, the currency could face resistance
around $1.3630-45, where its 14- and 21-day averages lie as well
as a 50 percent retracement of its decline earlier this month.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was down 0.4 percent at
1.2962 francs, while the dollar was down 0.2 percent at 0.9571
francs.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.1
percent at 78.318.
 Analysts said the dollar struggled after Federal Reserve
minutes suggested policymakers were in no hurry to shift an
ultra-loose monetary policy and after the dollar index failed to
close above its 100-day moving average for a third day running.
 Technical analysts said this suggests it will struggle to
extend gains from here. The 100-day moving average is currently
at 78.703.
 Later in the day, investors will look to U.S. CPI data due
at 1330 GMT for any signs of whether U.S. inflation is ticking
up.
 ""The risk of inflation varies from country to country. In
the United States inflation is still not an imminent risk and
U.S. interest rates are starting to tick down. That's capping
the dollar,"" said Junya Tanase, a strategist at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank in Tokyo.
 Many traders also said ramifications from uprisings in the
Middle East on developed economies and their currencies were far
too complex to fully assess at this point, leading many traders
to expect the dollar to stay in a well-worn range.
 Elsewhere, the U.S. currency hovered just above a near
three-year low against the Canadian dollar. It traded at
C$0.9850, a shade above low of $0.9832 hit earlier this month.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a 30-month high
on Thursday, driven by strong corporate earnings and cautious
optimism on the U.S. economic recovery from the Federal Reserve,
while oil prices edged higher on growing political tensions.
 Unrest spreading across the oil-rich Middle East and North
Africa also helped boost the appeal of safe-haven assets, with
Swiss francs gaining while yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries
and Bunds eased.
 Robust earnings and merger activity have boosted global
equities recently. Data from Thomson Reuters StarMine showed
three quarters of U.S. companies met or beat market expectations

 ""Many people are still optimistic about the market because
the global economy is doing well and earnings for large U.S.

equity markets strategist at Deutsche Postbank in Bonn.

 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
rose 0.3 percent, hitting their highest level since August
2008.
 The index has risen 4.7 percent so far this year, but its
valuations remain modest against a 10-year average. The MSCI
global index has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings of 12.5
times against a 10-year average of 14.8, Thomson Reuters

 The MSCI emerging market index put on 0.3 percent, though it
is down 3.4 percent for the year as many investors shift out of
the booming developing markets on concerns over inflation.

forecast-beating earnings from Swiss food group Nestle and
computer consultantcy Capgemini. In Asia, Japanese shares added
0.3 percent, up for the fourth straight session to a 9-1/2 month

 London crude prices extended gains to hold at 2-1/2 year
highs of more than $104 a barrel, as fresh Israel-Iran tension
fed spreading unrest in the Middle East and stoked fears of a
disruption of oil flows in the region.
 Copper, however, fell for the third straight session, down
0.8 percent after hitting a record high on Monday.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2011 03:40AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China sees only ant hill of hot money," * Hot money only 7 pct of China FX reserve increase -SAFE
 * No evidence that hot money influences stock market -SAFE
 * But warns of global impact of loose monetary policies
(adds quotes, details)
 BEIJING, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The amount of hot money entering
China in recent years is more an ant hill than a mountain, the
foreign exchange regulator said on Thursday, countering the
popular view that it faces a torrent of speculative inflows.
 A net $35.5 billion of hot money sneaked into China last
year, accounting for 7.6 percent of the country's increase in
official currency reserves, the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said.
 In China's first-ever public report to estimate the volume of
speculative cash entering the country, SAFE said that hot money
was not nearly as big a problem as worried officials often
suggest.
 Illicit cash inflows were more like ""ants moving home"",
coming in bits and pieces via multiple deals and transactions,
the regulator said.
 It added the capital flows in and out of China were generally
in line with the country's real level of economic activity.
 ""We have not found evidence of any large-scale capital
inflows coordinated by any established financial institution,""
the agency said.
 ""The argument that cross-border capital flows are driving
domestic stock market performance lacks evidence in the data,"" it
concluded.
 Nevertheless, it warned that all global liquidity was
building up because of loose monetary policies in developed
economies and that all countries would need to step up their
defences against capital inflows.
 Net hot money inflows in 2010 accounted for just 0.6 percent
of China's GDP, it said.
 Over the last decade, net hot money inflows averaged about
$28.9 billion a year, contributing roughly 9 percent to China's
foreign exchange reserve growth during that time, SAFE said in
its 45-page report.
 China registered about $400 billion in net capital outflows
from 1994 to 2002. With the economy booming, property prices
taking off and expectations for yuan appreciation mounting, the
tide shifted from 2003 to 2010, with China seeing about $300
billion in net inflows, SAFE said.
 In order to make capital flows more balanced, SAFE reiterated
a long-standing pledge to broaden capital outflow channels. It
also said that it would design financial, legal and
administrative measures in order to make it more difficult to
bring speculative capital into the country.
 SAFE said it would take ""extraordinary"" emergency measures in
sectors with excessive capital inflows.

 * Vessels identified as frigate and supply ship
 * Crossing throws new Egypt rulers into diplomatic spotlight

(Recasts with Iranian state media report)
 By Yusri Mohamed
 ISMAILIA, Egypt, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Iran appeared intent on
Thursday on sending two warships through the Suez Canal in a
move that Israel has called a ""provocation"", putting Egypt's new
military rulers in an unwelcome diplomatic spotlight.
Egypt, whose president was toppled by a mass uprising a week
ago, is a close ally of the United States. Cairo has a peace
treaty with Israel but its ties with Iran have been strained
since the country's 1979 revolution.
 Egypt's Suez Canal Authority said it had received no
notification so far from the Cairo government that would allow
the passage of the two Iranian ships. Approval from the defence
and foreign ministries is required for naval vessels to cross.
 ""I have not received any notification up to now,"" Ahmed
el-Manakhly, a member of the canal's board responsible for
shipping movement, told Reuters.
 Iranian state television said the two warships were due to
pass through the strategic waterway -- the first Iranian
military vessels to pass through the canal since Iran's 1979
revolution.
 English-language Press TV quoted an official as saying the
crossing would happen. ""Two Iranian warships are to cross the
Suez Canal. The vessels are on their way to the Suez Canal,"" he
said.
 Egyptian authorities saw ""nothing wrong"" with the passage of
the two warships through the canal, Press TV said.
 ""Iranian officials were in contact with officials in Cairo
to secure the vessels passage,"" it quoted an unnamed Iranian
navy official as saying.
 The Egyptian military, which has close defence links to the
United States, has been governing the country since President
Hosni Mubarak stepped down last Friday in the face of
unprecedented mass protests against his rule.
 
 'SPEAKING OUT OF TURN'
 Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Wednesday
plans for the warships to sail through the canal en route to
Syria were a ""provocation"". He had said the ships were expected
to pass through the Suez Canal overnight on Wednesday.
 Israel's state-funded Channel One television said Lieberman,
a vociferous far-right partner in the conservative coalition,
had spoken out of turn as the Defence Ministry ""had preferred to
ignore"" the ships' approach.
 It was not clear when the Iranian vessels were due to arrive
at the southern mouth of the canal, which links the Red Sea's
Gulf of Suez with the Mediterranean.
 An Egyptian official had identified the ships as the Alvand
and Kharg and said the vessels were near the Saudi Arabian Red
Sea port of Jeddah. Shipping experts had earlier said the ships
were the Alvand frigate and Kharg supply ship.
 According to the canal's timetable, the northbound ship
convoy starts entering the waterway from the Red Sea end at 6
a.m. (0400 GMT) daily, the Suez Canal website says. Ships head
south from the Mediterranean at other times of the day.
 Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported on Jan. 26
that Iranian navy cadets were going on a year-long training
mission into the Red Sea and through Suez to the Mediterranean.
 Syria is one of Israel's neighbouring adversaries. It has an
alliance with Iran which has deepened along with Tehran's
isolation from the West over its disputed nuclear programme,
which the Jewish state sees as an existential threat. Iran is a
sponsor of the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah.
 The Suez Canal is a vital commercial and strategic waterway
between Europe and the Middle East and Asia. It is also a
source of revenues for the Egyptian government.

 The canal routinely receives notification from the Egyptian

 By Silke Koltrowitz
 VEVEY, Switzerland, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Swiss food giant
Nestle said on Thursday that strong demand in emerging markets
would help it offset rising raw materials prices. 
 It reported underlying sales growth accelerated to 6.4
percent in the fourth quarter and said it was on course to hit
targets for 2011.
 ""We are starting 2011 with continued momentum, well placed
to face uncertainties ahead, including volatile raw material
prices,"" Nestle said in a statement.
 ""We are therefore confident of achieving the Nestle model in
2011: organic growth between 5 percent and 6 percent and an EBIT
margin improvement in constant currencies.""
 Nestle can rely on its strong presence in emerging markets
and the appeal of brands such as Nescafe coffee or KitKat
chocolate bars to offset rising costs for milk, cocoa, coffee,
sugar and grain.
 Full-year net profit rose to 34.2 billion Swiss francs,
including the proceeds from the sale of its remaining stake in
eyecare group Alcon to Novartis.
 Annual sales at its premium coffee capsules Nespresso brand
exceeded 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.1 billion) for the first
time, the maker of Gerber baby food and Maggi soups said.
 ""A very strong set of figures with underlying earnings ...
on the back of stronger-than-expected top-line growth driven by
emerging markets and Asia. Its outlook statement is reassuring,""
Kepler Research analyst Jon Cox said.
 Peers Danone and Unilever recently said they were confident
about passing on higher costs but Kraft Foods lowered its 2011
forecast for earnings growth because it expects some consumers
to be put off by price increases.

 * Major currencies seen hugging well-worn range
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-week low
against a basket of currencies on Thursday, hurt by worries over
rising tensions in the Middle East and as subdued U.S. economic
data helped keep a rise in U.S. bond yields in check.
 But traders were not overly bearish on the currency against
the backdrop of a generally improving U.S. economy and also as
the euro is seen susceptible to lingering worries over the euro
zone's debt problems.
 The greenback fell on Wednesday after Israel's foreign
minister, a vociferously far-right partner in the conservative
coalition, said two Iranian warships planned to sail through the
Suez Canal en route to Syria, calling the step a ""provocation"".
 The news rekindled worries that a regime change in Egypt
could make the entire region unstable, although financial markets
were not completely risk-averse with Wall Street shares hitting
new highs.
 The market's knee-jerk reaction was to sell the dollar,
although it has tended to be bought at times of crisis in the
past.
 ""My feeling is the market is looking beyond the era where the
U.S. has been the world's policeman,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding that the threat of
geopolitical crisis no longer automatically leads to dollar
buying.
 Traders kept an eye on the Middle East, as clashes are
reported in many countries including Bahrain, a regional hub for
banking and financial services and home to a major U.S. naval
base.
 But many traders said ramifications from uprisings in the
Middle East on developed economies and their currencies were far
too complex at this point, leading many traders to expect the
dollar to stay in its well-worn range.
 The dollar index fell 0.1 percent to 78.144, falling as low

 The euro rose 0.15 percent in Asian trade, adding to its 0.5
percent gains on Wednesday, to $1.3588, extending its recovery
from a three-week low of $1.3428 hit last week.
 The euro could face resistance around $1.3630-45, where its
14- and 21-day averages lie as well as a 50 percent retracement
of its decline earlier this month.
 Worries about the Middle East kept the safe-haven Swiss franc

 The dollar fetched 0.9588 franc, having fallen as low as
0.9554 franc on Wednesday while the euro bought 1.3025 francs,
near a one-week low of 1.2974 hit on Wednesday.
 The dollar also ran out of steam against the yen after
hitting an eight-week peak of 83.98 yen on Wednesday. It fetched
83.58 yen..
 The dollar also lacked fuel as U.S. bond yields have shown
signs of stabilising.
 U.S. industrial output data fell short of market expectations
a day after retail sales data disappointed investors.
 Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 25-26 policy meeting
suggested the bank remained unhappy with the job market's
recovery and the consensus was still firmly aligned with
completing the planned purchase of $600 billion in government
bonds.
 Although rising inflation around the globe has led some
investors to speculate there could be a rate hike by the Fed,
such expectations will likely prove to be premature, said Junya
Tanase, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank.
 ""The risk of inflation varies from country to country. In the
United States, inflation is still not an imminent risk and U.S.
interest rates are starting to tick down. That's capping the
dollar,"" Tanase said.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The dollar was soft on Thursday,
bruised by worries over rising tension in the Middle East and as
subdued U.S. economic data helped keep U.S. bond yields down.
 The greenback fell on Wednesday after Israel said two Iranian
warships planned to sail through the Suez Canal en route to
Syria, calling the step a ""provocation"".
 The news rekindled fear that a regime change in Egypt could
make the entire region unstable, although financial markets were
not completely risk-averse with Wall Street shares hitting new
highs.
 Although the dollar has tended to be bought at times of
crisis in the past, the market's knee-jerk reaction was to sell
the dollar.
 ""My feeling is the market is looking beyond the era where the
U.S. has been the world's policeman,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding that the threat of
geopolitical crisis would no longer automatically lead to dollar
buying.
 The dollar dropped to a one week low against the safe-haven
Swiss franc on Wednesday, falling as low as 0.9554 franc. It last
traded at 0.9594 franc.
 The euro held firm at $1.3571, having climbed more than 0.5
percent on Wednesday and rising further from a three-week low of
$1.3428 hit last week.
 The dollar also ran out of steam against the yen after
hitting an eight-week peak of 83.98 yen on Wednesday. It fetched
83.58 yen in early Asian trade..
 The dollar also lacked fuel as U.S. bond yields have shown
some signs of stabilising.
 U.S. industrial output data fell short of market
expectations, one day after retail sales data disappointed
investors.
 The minutes of the Federal Reserve's previous policy meeting
suggested the bank remained unhappy with the job market's
recovery and the consensus was still firmly aligned with

 But traders also said the greenback's fall is seen as being
limited as the euro suffers from lingering worries over debt.
 ""I don't think we'll see a clear trend in either direction
for the time being,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Asian shares eked out modest
gains for the second consecutive day on Thursday after the
Federal Reserve offered a cautiously optimistic view of the U.S.
economy, while oil prices edged higher on growing tensions in
the Middle East.	
 Japanese shares led gains in the region, rising to a
fresh 9-1/2 month peak, boosted by healthy corporate earnings,
strong inflows from foreign investors and gains on Wall Street.

 The Nikkei ended up 0.3 percent, with the broader Topix
index up 0.7 percent. 
 Stocks in most of Asia ex-Japan also edged higher with
buying across the materials, consumers and the energy sectors,
though benchmark indexes fell in Singapore and South
Korea , where the government unveiled cash support for
troubled saving banks. 
 The MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
was up 0.2 percent, moving further away from a
two-month low tested last Friday.	
 Japanese shares have gained some 6 percent this year, making
it the best-performing Asian market so far in 2011, while Asian
stocks outside Japan are down more than 2
percent as worries about growing inflationary pressures prompt
foreign investors to rotate money out of emerging economies.	
 While Asian central banks have scrambled to tighten policy,
some countries are still perceived to be falling behind in
fighting inflation, making investors cautious about adding
exposure to these markets even though recent steep drops have
made valuations more attractive.	
 ""Emerging market tightening is falling short of what needs
to be done due to concerns that higher rates will lead to
currency strength,"" Brown Brothers Harriman strategists said in
a note.	
 ""As such, more and more EM countries are being viewed as
behind the curve and so the current period of EM
underperformance could continue until more signs are seen they
are getting back ahead of the curve.""	
 Halfway through the first quarter of 2011, the worst
performing markets within the region are India, Philippines,
Thailand and Indonesia though indications show that some of them
may be nearing a floor for now.	
 Much of the outflows from these countries have gone into
developed markets, which have also benefited from a steady flow
of encouraging economic data and robust corporate earnings.	
 Minutes of the Fed's Jan 25-26 policy session on Wednesday
showed officials were more confident on economic recovery,
though the job market recovery remained a concern.
.	
 Japan has been one of the big beneficiaries of these flows
with overseas investors net buyers of Japanese stocks last week
for the 15th straight week, the longest buying streak since late
2005/early 2006, according to latest data.	
 Asia equity ETF redemptions slowed to just $55 million last
week after averaging $369 million in the previous three weeks
while local buying in India was the biggest since late 2009,
data from Trim Tabs Investment Research showed, indicating some
of the selling may have run its course.	
 
 OIL RISES	
 Brent crude hovered near 2-1/2 year highs at just under $104
a barrel and U.S. crude for March delivery
flirted with the $85 mark as anti-government protests spread in
the Middle East and on news that Iranian warships were en route
to Syria.	
 The rising tensions also pushed gold and U.S.
Treasuries, typical safe-haven assets, higher, after Israel
hinted at a possible response to Iran's move.	
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. note rose 3/32 in
price to yield 3.61 percent, down about a basis point from late
U.S. trade on Wednesday. The yield remained below a peak of 3.77
percent hit last week, its highest since April. .	
 In the currency markets, the dollar ran out of steam versus
the yen after hitting an eight-week peak of 83.98 yen on
Wednesday as the Fed's minutes also showed the bank remained
unhappy with the job market's recovery.	
But traders said the greenback's weakness,
especially against the euro is likely limited as the euro
suffered from lingering worries over debt.	
 ""I don't think we'll see a clear trend in either direction
for the time being,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage.

 * South Korea wants to double size of Chiang Mai to $240 bln
 * An expansion could lead to diminished role for IMF
(Adds details)
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Japan will seek support for the
expansion of a currency swap network to prevent financial crises
in Asia at the Group of 20 finance minsters meeting this week, a
newspaper reported, echoing similar calls from South Korea.
 Should Asian countries embark on such a move, it would be
another sign that policymakers are slowly redesigning the
institutions that monitor the global financial system with a
potentially diminished role for the International Monetary Fund.
 Japan will propose that the Chiang Mai Initiative, under
which East Asian nations can swap currencies if the region falls
into credit turmoil, be enlarged in monetary terms and may also
ask more countries in the region to join, the Nikkei business
daily said.
 South Korea's finance minister last week called for a
doubling in size of the network to $240 billion.
 Japan hopes to reach an agreement with neighbouring countries
in the next two to three years, the Nikkei said.
 Officials at Japan's finance ministry were not immediately
available to comment.
 Asian countries have floated the idea of expanding their
currency swap framework before, but the idea has usually met U.S.
opposition due to concerns about the IMF's role.
 In Europe too, new moves are afoot.
 European finance ministers agreed on Monday to a permanent
rescue mechanism to address its year-long sovereign debt crisis
that will accept money from the IMF but the mechanism could
eventually eclipse the IMF's presence in Europe.
 Finance chiefs and central bankers from G20 countries will
gather in Paris on Feb. 18-19 to discuss how to deal with global
economic imbalances, reform of the international monetary system
and financial regulation.
 The Japanese government has drawn some inspiration from a
lending facility for emerging economies that the IMF set up in
2008 at the height of the U.S. mortgage derivatives crisis, the
Nikkei said.
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda will present the idea at the
meeting, the Nikkei said. Noda said this week that Japan wants to
actively convey its views on regional financial cooperation,
including the IMF's role, at the G20 finance chiefs' meeting.
 The government wants to start talks on the issue in May when
finance ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Japan, China and South Korea meet, according to the
Nikkei.
 The Chiang Mai Initiative was set up in May 2000 after a
meeting of Asian finance ministers in the Thai city of Chiang Mai
to try to prevent a repeat of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis
and encompasses the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus
China, Japan, and South Korea.

 WASHINGTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Managing excessive domestic
demand and volatile short-term capital flows were major
challenges for Turkish authorities this year, the International
Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.
 In a report on the Turkish economy, the IMF cautioned that
the surge of capital into the country was set to continue this
year amid favorable near-term growth prospects and a healthy
balance sheet.
 ""These vulnerabilities could be effectively addressed
through a combination of fiscal and macroprudential tightening,
more restrictive liquidity conditions, and competitiveness
enhancing structural reforms,"" the IMF said.
 The fund projected that Turkish growth would slow to 4.5
percent in 2011, down from about 8.2 percent in 2010.
 Inflation, meanwhile, was set to rise to 6.5 percent by the
end of the year, up from 6.4 percent in 2010, due to increasing
demand and cost pressures, the IMF added.
 The Fund said Turkish monetary policy should focus on price
stability and noted that if inflationary pressures grow then
the government should stand ready to raise interest rates.
 The IMF said board directors were divided over Turkey's
budget plans, with some directors backing the fiscal stance for
this year and others calling for spending cuts to restrain
domestic demand and rein in the current account deficit.
 The fund projected that Turkey's current account gap will widen to 7 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 due to
higher energy prices and strong import growth.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2011 05:16PM ET</span>","Australia cbank sees GDP, inflation hit from floods"," SYDNEY, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank on
Thursday said economic output would be around 1 percent lower
this quarter because of weather damage while inflation would
rise to 3 percent by mid-year, in a major revision to forecasts
made just two weeks ago.	
 In a speech, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant
Governor Philip Lowe also said global commodity prices were
likely to remain strong for some time, given supply constraints.	
 That could add to inflationary pressure across Asia and
might risk a sharp slowdown in growth if central banks have to
respond by tightening aggressively.	
 Lowe said damage from recent flooding and Cyclone Yasi meant
total output in the current quarter would be around 1 percent
lower than it otherwise would have been.	
 ""Given this mainly arises from a disruption to production,
the decline in spending is likely to be somewhat smaller than 1
percent,"" he added.	
 He expected growth to rebound strongly from then on and
reiterated the bank's forecast of gross domestic product (GDP)
growth of 4.25 percent for all of 2011.	
 Consumer price inflation (CPI) was now expected to rise to
an annual 3 percent by June, up from a forecast of 2.5 percent
the RBA made just two weeks ago.	
 ""The bank now expects CPI inflation to be around 3 percent
over the year to June 2011, with the combined effect of floods
and the cyclone likely to contribute around half a percentage
point to this outcome,"" said Lowe, who heads the bank's
economics division.	
 Headline inflation ran at 2.7 percent in 2010, within the
RBA's long term target band of 2 to 3 percent.	
 Much of the increase would be due to a sharp rise in the
price of bananas as Cyclone Yasi destroyed much of the crop.	
 But Lowe said banana prices were expected to fall back to
more normal levels later in the year, and that there would be a
period during 2012 when year-ended inflation outcomes could be
expected to be lower than previously forecast.	
 ""Looking through these weather-related effects, inflation is
expected to gradually increase over the next couple of years to
around 3 percent in late 2012,"" he said.	
 Lowe added that restrained consumer spending seemed to be
putting downward pressure on prices for many retail goods,
forcing retailers to pass on falls in import prices faster than
they would have otherwise.	
 How persistent this consumer restraint proved to be would be
crucial to the outlook for the economy, and monetary policy.	
 ""On the one hand, it was plausible that consumption growth
will strengthen considerably over the period ahead, supported by
strong income growth and an unemployment rate that is trending
down,"" said Lowe.	
 ""On the other hand, this more cautious approach to spending
could be quite long lasting, with households using the strong
income growth to further improve their balance sheets.""	
 Last week, RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said interest rates
were likely on hold for some time in large part because the
moderation in consumer spending was providing scope for the
mining sector to boom without adding to inflation.	
 Australia's huge resource sector is riding a wave of high
prices, fuelled by demand from the urbanisation and
industrialisation of China and India.	
 ""For many commodities, global inventories are now quite low
and it would appear that we are currently operating on a
relatively steep part of the global commodity supply curve,""
said Lowe. While increased investment would add to supply over
time, it was a slow process, he added.	
 ""It would appear that the ability of the world to produce
commodities is becoming a key constraint on non-inflationary
growth for the global economy,"" said Lowe.	
 ""The world economy is going through a change in relative
prices, and that this change is likely to be quite persistent.""	
 This need not be inflationary for the world, he said, if
monetary policy was set appropriately and inflation expectations
were contained.	
 The RBA has been one of the most pre-emptive central banks
in the developed world, lifting interest rates by 175 basis
points since late 2009.	
 But Lowe noted that, at the moment, monetary policy was
stimulatory in much of the world, including Asia.	
 High food prices across Asia had lifted headline inflation
rates and inflation expectations, he added.	
 ""If these inflationary pressures were to intensify, a
stronger policy response than seen to date would be likely,
increasing the risk of a subsequent sharp slowdown in the
region.""

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The dollar sank on Wednesday
as news Iranian warships were en route to Syria rekindled
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, sparking a spike in
oil and a surge in traditional safe-haven currencies such as
the Swiss franc.
 Technical factors and market positioning also weighed on
the dollar, especially against the euro, as investors holding
short euros got squeezed when the greenback fell and crude oil
rose. The dollar's losses, however, should prove short-lived,
some analysts said, with the currency supported by a recent
spate of positive U.S. economic data.
 ""The Iran story is certainly escalating the geopolitical
risk,"" said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president of capital
markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 Israel's foreign minister said moves by two Iranian war
ships to sail through the Suez canal to Syria were a
""provocation"" by Tehran. For more, see: [nLDE71F2BQ]
 ""We got a move away from the dollar because oil prices went
up after the Iranian news. But we think this is just a
short-term push up in the euro versus the dollar. We love the
U.S. data this morning.""
 In general, the greenback tends to fall when oil prices,
which are denominated in dollars, rise because it becomes
cheaper for overseas investors holding foreign currencies to
buy crude oil.
 Brent oil prices surged to near 2-1/2-year highs on the
Iran news. [ID:nL3E7DG07P]
 In late afternoon trading, the euro rose 0.5 percent
against the dollar to $1.3562 , its second consecutive
daily gain. Investors short the euro tried to push the currency
below $1.3480, the roughly 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the euro's January to February rally.
 The euro got as low as $1.3462 on electronic trading
platform EBS in the wake of Wednesday's positive U.S. data, but
it quickly rebounded on short-covering.
 The Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven, especially
during times of geopolitical turmoil, rose, pushing the dollar
down 0.8 percent to 0.9597 francs . It soared nearly 1
percent after the news broke.
 The franc has risen against the dollar for three straight
sessions and has gained roughly 2.5 percent so far.
 The Swiss currency also edged up against the euro
, which slipped 0.2 percent to 1.3016 francs. On the
month, the euro was still up 0.7 percent.
 Meanwhile, the dollar's nearly two-week rally against the
yen came to a halt, with earlier gains erased as U.S. Treasury
yields fell on the Middle East news. U.S. inflation and housing
data sent Treasury yields higher early in the session.
[ID:nLLAGDE7BN] [ID:nCAT005381
 The dollar has outperformed the yen in nine of the past 11
sessions as U.S. Treasury yields factored in inflation. In late
afternoon New York trading, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at
83.67 .
 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday released the minutes of
its last meeting and echoed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's
testimony to the House of Representatives last week. The U.S.
central bank was optimistic about prospects for the economy,
but it was not bullish enough for markets to change its
expectations that the Fed's debt purchases, known as
quantitative easing, will last until June. [ID:nN16297279].
 The dollar showed little reaction after the Fed minutes,
although the comments added to the greenback's generally

a rate rise after the Bank of England downgraded its economic
growth forecast in its quarterly inflation report, even as
consumer prices spiked higher.
 Sterling  fell to the day's low of $1.5987,

 SAFE-HAVEN FRANC
 The U.S. dollar fell more than 1 percent to a session low
of 0.9554 Swiss franc  on trading platform EBS on
tensions between Israel and Iran. The franc is often seen as a
safe-haven in times of geopolitical turmoil. The euro slipped
0.2 percent versus the franc .
 The dollar also fell versus the euro  on the news

that this could be a security threat for Israel.

strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Douglas Borthwick, managing director at FX execution firm

confirmation the greenback is losing its flight to quality
status.
 ""The market moved into the euro rather than the U.S.
dollar, showing the euro is now the flight to quality

 Sterling fell  after the Bank of England downgraded
its economic outlook in its quarterly inflation report, even as
consumer prices spiked higher, stoking fears of stagflation and
dampened expectations UK interest rates would rise sooner
rather than later.
 ""The key guidance being that any tightening ahead is likely
to prove modest with potentially only 0.50 point of tightening
in 2011,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFL.
 Inflationary pressures may also be building up in the
United States, a potentially troubling development for the

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - World stocks reached 30-month
highs on Wednesday on strong corporate earnings, while oil and the
Swiss franc rallied after Israel said a move by Iranian warships
to traverse the Suez Canal was a ""provocation.""
 The comments by Israel's foreign minister, together with
reports of protests in Iran, Yemen and Bahrain, raised concern
Middle East tensions could disrupt oil supplies. For details, see
[ID:nN16REASUR] [ID:nLDE71F0T5]
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.7 percent
to 345.50, after hitting its strongest since August 2008.
 Brent crude futures earlier jumped to 29-month highs above
$104 a barrel . U.S. crude  for March delivery
climbed as high as $85.95 a barrel, extending gains after crude
oil and gasoline stockpiles rose less than expected last week.
 ""Troubles in the Middle East are back on the agenda, protests
in Bahrain and Saudi have drummed up political tension,"" said Rob
Montefusco, an oil trader at Sucden Financial.
 Wall Street advanced after estimate-beating results from
technology bellwether Dell Inc.  and a flurry of deal
news.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was last up 60.02
points, or 0.49 percent, at 12,286.55. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> rose 7.72 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,335.73. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 21.14 points, or 0.76
percent, to 2,825.58.
 European shares <.FTEU3> posted a 29-month closing high for
the third straight day, supported by strong earnings from French
bank Societe Generale  and brewer Heineken .
 The gains followed an earlier jump in Japan's Nikkei average
<.N225> to a nine-month high. Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> were up
0.5 percent.
 ""There is a growing confidence in the outlook for the global
economy. The recovery looks like it is being transformed into a
sustainable expansion and that does mean that the outlook for
earnings is very positive,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at
Brewin Dolphin.
 SAFE-HAVEN FRANC
 The U.S. dollar fell more than 1 percent to a session low of
0.9554 Swiss franc  on trading platform EBS on tensions
between Israel and Iran. It last traded at 0.9588, down 0.8
percent. The franc is often seen as a safe-haven in times of
geopolitical turmoil.
 The dollar also fell versus the euro  on the news
from Israel and traders said the dollar was being sold on the view
that this could be a security threat for Israel.
""Should there be a conflict with Israel, this would be bad for
the U.S. as well,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Douglas Borthwick, managing director at FX execution firm
Faros Trading, said the market's reaction provided further
confirmation the greenback is losing its flight to quality
status.
 ""The market moved into the euro rather than the U.S. dollar,
showing the euro is now the flight to quality destination,"" he
said.
 Sterling fell  after the Bank of England downgraded
its economic outlook in its quarterly inflation report, even as
consumer prices spiked higher, stoking fears of stagflation and
dampened expectations UK interest rates would rise sooner rather
than later.
 ""The key guidance being that any tightening ahead is likely to
prove modest with potentially only 0.50 point of tightening in
2011,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFL.
 Inflationary pressures may also be building up in the United
States, a potentially troubling development for the Federal
Reserve. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. core producer prices in
January rose to their highest rate in more than two years. See

88,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2011 03:08PM ET</span>",PROFILE-Hugary's economy minister Gyorgy Matolcsy," Position: Hungarian Economy Minister
 Incumbent: Gyorgy Matolcsy, born July 18, 1955
 Term: Assumed office on May 29, 2010, for four years
 
 Key facts:
 -- Matolcsy is one of the authors of both the 1998 and 2010
election winning economic programmes of the governing
centre-right Fidesz party, which has ruled with an unprecedented
two-thirds majority since May 2010. He is a key theorist behind
the Hungarian government's recent economic path, which
emphasises growth and eschews austerity in the effort to recover
from the deepest recession since the fall of Communism.
 -- Matolcsy has steered Hungary on an economic path that
eschews austerity cuts and aims to create room in the budget for
2011 income tax cuts and meet the EU 2.94 percent/GDP budget
deficit target. The government aims to meet this target with the
help of a windfall tax on the financial, energy, telecom and
retail sectors, as well as an effective re-nationalisation of
the country's mandatory private pension funds.
 -- The economy minister, who oversees budget planning and a
host of other financial areas, enjoys the full support of Prime
Minister Viktor Orban, who has called him ""his right hand"".
 -- Matolcsy's career spans the communist-era Finance
Ministry, a range of research institutions, and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, where he was deputy
director, then director, in the early 1990s. Although he was a
member of the first Fidesz government, he did not join the party
until 2003.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2011 02:56PM ET</span>",PROFILE-Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban," Position: Hungarian Prime Minister
 Incumbent: Viktor Orban, born May 31, 1963
 Term: Assumed office on May 29, 2010, for four years
 
 Key facts:
 -- Orban leads the strongest government in Hungary's
post-communist history. His centre-right Fidesz party, in a
tight alliance with the small Christian Democrats, controls a
two-thirds majority in parliament. Its MPs are disciplined, and
Orban and Fidesz can rush through legislation at will.
 -- Orban is fiercely independent and has not shied away from
conflict with markets. After taking office, Orban broke ties
with the International Monetary Fund, which bailed Hungary out
with an emergency loan in 2008, saying he would take direction
from nobody except the European Union. Even so, it took Fidesz
until September to accept the EU's 3 percent of GDP budget
deficit limit for 2011.
 -- Orban's administration has put forward a string of
measures that confounded markets, including a steep windfall tax
on the financial, energy, telecom and retail sectors, and an
effective re-nationalisation of the country's mandatory private
pension funds. The money thus raised will be used to fund income
tax cuts, plug a hole in the state pension fund, and repay some
of Hungary's large public debt.
 -- Non-financial measures have been equally contentious,
including curbing the jurisdiction of the top Constitutional
Court, and passing a strict media law which critics have said
could be used to silence dissent.
 -- Orban takes over the rotating presidency of the European
Union on Jan. 1, 2011.
 -- The main priorities of the Hungarian presidency are an
amendment to the Lisbon Treaty allowing the creation of a
European Stability Mechanism; energy security, continuation of
EU enlargement, tackling the Roma issue, and promoting a
European Danube strategy.
 -- Orban has spent his entire career in politics. He has led
the Fidesz party for most of the past two decades, and was prime
minister between 1998 and 2002. He returned to the helm of
government after two elections lost to the Socialists.

 Incumbent: Andras Simor, born May 17, 1954
 Term: Appointed on March 3, 2007 for six years
 
 Key facts:
 -- Simor shares the plight of Hungarian central bank
governors since 1990 who have all faced a hostile government in
part of their terms. Viktor Orban's centre-right government, in
power since May 2010, has attacked Simor and NBH rate setters
who were appointed under Socialist governments.
 -- The centre-right has slammed Simor's personal investments
and the NBH's monetary policy which the government said was too
tight. Simor has rejected calls for his resignation.
 -- The government has slashed Simor's salary in a move
criticised by the European Union, and plans to change
appointment rules to pack the rate-setting panel with parliament
appointees by March. They may vote down Simor and his two
deputies as the ruling Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in
parliament.
 -- Simor said in an interview in January that the bank was
under ""blatant pressure"" from the government but criticism of
rate increases were counterproductive. He also complained that
communication between him and the government was thin.
 -- Simor has repeatedly promised to fulfil his mandate which
will end in 2013, but there is still some speculation in markets
about his possible resignation ,if the Monetary Council's revamp
increases tensions.
 -- Sources close to Simor have described him as a fighter
who was, however, upset by the government attacks.
 -- Before becoming NBH chief, Simor was the head of
accounting firm Deloitte's Hungarian unit. He was chairman of
the Budapest Stock Exchange between 1998 and 2002. Around 1990
he developed the Hungarian brokerage unit of Austria's
Creditanstalt into a market leader.

 Key facts:
 The former infrastructure minister has headed an edgy
coalition between his Social Democrats and the conservative
People's Party in neutral Austria for more than two years.
 -- Faymann, who has good contacts at popular newspapers
Kronen Zeitung and Heute, kicked off his political career in his
home town of Vienna, where he worked on the housing and planning
council and once headed the city's tenants association.
 -- He helped oust unpopular Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer as
party chief in 2008 after its dismal result in a state election.
 -- The Social Democrats suffered their worst results ever in
2008 national elections but to the surprise of many remained the
strongest single force in Austrian politics, letting Faymann
claim the chancellor's post.
 -- He has stable ties to Vice Chancellor Josef Proell, the
conservative finance minister, but their parties often squabble
over Social Democrats' proposals to abolish the draft and reform
the education system.
 -- Friendly and rather colourless for a politician, Faymann
studied law in Vienna before entering local politics,
strengthening his base by heading the city's housing department
for more than a decade.
 -- A leaked 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable published by the
Wikileaks website described Faymann as having ""no personal
interest in foreign affairs"", something the chancellor denies.

number of high-level positions in financial institutions. He was
brought in as chief executive of the Austrian BAWAG P.S.K.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped broadly on
Wednesday after Israel said Iranian warships were en route to
Syria and demand for non-U.S. safe-haven currencies was seen
thriving should the situation worsen.
 Israel's foreign minister said moves by two Iranian war
ships to sail through the Suez canal to Syria were a
""provocation"" by Tehran.
 ""The dollar is being sold off against the Swiss franc and
the euro because should there be a conflict with Israel, this
would be bad for the U.S. as well, "" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven especially during
times of geopolitical turmoil, was last at 0.9619, up 0.5
percent against the dollar. It soared nearly 1 percent after
the news broke.
 The franc initially gained 0.2 percent against the euro and
was last up 0.1 percent at 1.3032.
 ""The market has been really volatile over the past few days
and the latest events have certainly added to that,"" said
Charles St-Arnaud, foreign exchange strategist at Nomura
Securities in New York.
 Firmer overseas equities market and a well-received debt
auction out of Spain, buoyed demand for the euro as well, he
said.
 ""Confidence in sovereign debt has improved and the
situation in Europe may be stabilizing,"" he said. ""Spain is the
main player right now, so a solid auction bodes well for the
euro.""
 The euro rose 0.4 percent against the dollar to $1.3547,
its second consecutive daily gain.
 Meanwhile, the dollar's nearly two-week rally against the
yen came to a halt, with earlier gains erased as U.S. Treasury
yields fell on the Mideast news. U.S. inflation and housing
data sent Treasury yields higher earlier in the session.
 Sterling fell sharply as investors revised expectations for
a rate rise after the Bank of England downgraded its economic
growth forecast in its quarterly inflation report, even as
consumer prices spiked higher.
 The central bank predicted a bumpy ride for the economy
this year, with its 2011 forecasts for growth lower than in
predictions made in November.
 according to Reuters data, compared with around $1.6140
before the Bank of England's quarterly report on inflation was
released. It also lost ground against the euro, with the common
currency rising to a session high of 84.34 pence from 83.85
pence. 
 ""One suspects that some large speculative players are
positioned with double no-touch options, collecting a pay-out
should the euro never hit $1.33-$1.38 over the next month,""

 But the mega-deal faces political and regulatory hurdles on
possible anti-competition grounds, which has sparked rivals'
hopes that anti-trust regulators might enforce asset sales or
open access to prized services such as clearing.
 ""The most contentious area (of the Deutsche Boerse deal) is
clearing, where they may be forced to open up their wholly-owned
vertical clearing model to third parties,"" Alasdair Haynes, the
chief executive of trading platform Chi-X Europe, told Reuters.
 This, which echoes views expressed by analysts and traders,
could threaten one of Deutsche Boerse's most lucrative business
lines - Eurex Clearing.
 Clearing houses, such as Eurex Clearing, make trading on an
exchange less risky by acting as a central counterparty which
sits between trading partners and insures each party against a
default by the other, a service for which it charges.
 Eurex Clearing, Deutsche Boerse's exclusive clearing
provider, handles all trades executed on its equities and
derivatives markets.
 The LSE, Chi-X Europe and NYSE Euronext differ from Deutsche
Boerse because they use third parties to clear their markets,
historically a source of consternation between the rivals.
 But NYSE Euronext said last year it is building its own
clearing capability for launch next year, a move that will bring
it into line with its German counterpart.
 Traders have speculated this week, however, that NYSE
Euronext trades could also be routed to Eurex Clearing if the
merger is successful -- a move that would make Eurex Clearing
easily the largest provider in Europe.
 ""This model is already infuriating clients and the prospect
of even more business passing through Eurex Clearing is
concerning from a competitive point of view,"" Haynes said.
 
 MONOPOLY FEARS
 A Deutsche Boerse/NYSE Euronext group would also combine the
German group's Eurex exchange and Euronext's Liffe into a new
market that will hold about 94 percent of European futures
trading, according to the World Federation of Exchanges. This
has fuelled concern among trading firms over the prospect of
monopoly pricing.
 LSE chief Xavier Rolet, whose own planned merger with
Toronto exchange TMX Group was eclipsed by the Deutsche
Boerse/NYSE announcement, is hoping banks will seek out smaller
exchange rivals to ensure prices remain competitive.
 ""You've got anxious banks who are also shareholders of (LSE
trading system) Turquoise who will have to ensure there is no
monopoly in derivatives,"" said Rolet.
 ""We think we are going to be a pretty attractive alternative
and the banks will have a heightened interest in promoting the
emergence of a second competitor.""
 The LSE plans to start trading European futures on Turquoise
before the end of this June in a bid to challenge Eurex and
Liffe head-on for the first time.
 And the UK exchange might be well placed to mop up any
choice assets if regulators force Deutsche Boerse and NYSE
Euronext to spin off parts of their derivatives business,
according to one head of trading at a large European investment
bank, which is also a Turquoise shareholder.
 He said: ""If there is any disposal, Liffe would be
interesting to the LSE given the UK exchange's move into
European equity derivatives.""
 The LSE said last week it was in exclusive takeover talks
with TMX Group and Chi-X Europe has been in merger talks with
U.S. exchange Bats Global Markets since December.

 NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Major stock markets rallied to
fresh 30-month highs on Wednesday on strong corporate earnings,
while oil and the Swiss franc gained after Israel said a move
by Iranian warships to traverse the Suez Canal was a
""provocation"".
 The comments by Israel's foreign minister, together with
reports of political protests in Iran, Yemen and Bahrain,
raised worries unrest in the Middle East could disrupt oil
supplies. See [ID:nN16REASUR] and [ID:nLDE71F0T5]
 U.S. stocks rose after estimate-beating results from
technology bellwether Dell Inc.  and a deal for
Sanofi-Aventis  to buy Genzyme  for $20.1
billion in cash.
 The euro gained versus the dollar  on the news
from Israel. The save-haven Swiss reached a session high versus
the dollar . Traders said the dollar was being sold on
the view that this could be a security threat for Israel.
 ""The dollar is being sold off against the Swiss franc and
the euro because, should there be a conflict with Israel, this
would be bad for the U.S. as well, "" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.6
percent to 345.04, after hitting its strongest since August
2008.
 Sterling tumbled against the euro and dollar after the Bank
of England downgraded its economic outlook in its quarterly
inflation report, even as consumer prices spiked higher. That
stoked fears of stagflation.
 ""The key guidance being that any tightening ahead is likely
to prove modest with potentially only 0.50 point of tightening
in 2011,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFL. ""Such guidance has disappointed current
market expectations which had moved to discount even more
aggressive tightening ahead.""
 European share prices also edged higher, supported by
strong earnings from French bank Societe Generale  and
brewer Heineken , The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300

 U.S. crude  for March delivery climbed 47 cents to
$84.80 a barrel, extending gains after a government report
showed crude oil and gasoline stockpiles rose less than

 A rare show of unrest in Libya added to fears the kind of
unrest that toppled the presidents of Egypt and Tunisia could
spread to oil-producing countries in the Middle East.
 ""This morning troubles in the Middle East are back on the

(Recasts with PM, central bank comments)
 By Raushan Nurshayeva
 ASTANA, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's prime minister
rebuked the central bank on Wednesday for allowing the tenge to
appreciate too fast, locking horns with its reformist governor
over currency policy in the resource-rich Central Asian state.
 The clash between Prime Minister Karim Masimov and Grigory
Marchenko, in his second spell at the helm of the central bank,
revealed internal discord on how best to manage the impact of a
strengthening tenge on Kazakhstan's $147 billion economy.
 Marchenko said the central bank had bought $3.2 billion on
the foreign exchange market in the first two months of this year
to curb appreciation of the tenge , which is trading near
eight-month highs against the dollar.
 This is 60 percent more than it bought in the whole of 2010.
 Despite these purchases, Masimov said the bank had allowed
the tenge to strengthen too much, jeopardising prospects for
exporters of the commodities Kazakhstan produces in abundance.
 ""I have certain complaints against the National Bank and
personally against Grigory Alexandrovich,"" Masimov, referring to
Marchenko by his name and patronymic, said at a meeting of the
parliamentary faction of the ruling Nur-Otan party.
 ""He is excessively strengthening the national currency, and
this weighs heavily on our competitiveness,"" he said. ""Grigory
Alexandrovich: you should not strengthen it any further.""
 Marchenko, who said he believed the tenge would continue to
strengthen in the near term, disputed this assessment and said
the central bank was pursuing ""the right policy"".
 ""Given the current level of raw material prices on world
markets, none of our exporters has so far complained,"" he said
in response to the prime minister. ""Apparently, they complain to
you, not to us.""
 Resurgent world prices for the commodities exported by
Kazakhstan, including oil, industrial metals and grain, have
bolstered the tenge as it prepares to abandon a protective
trading corridor in March and return to a managed float.
 The weighted average of the tenge on the Kazakhstan Stock
Exchange was 146.36 per dollar on Wednesday. It has strengthened
from 147.34 per dollar at the end of last year.
 ""The government would like firm economic growth, while the
central bank's mandate is to promote price stability and keep
inflation no higher than 8 percent,"" said Alexander Morozov,
chief economist for Russia and the CIS at HSBC.
 
 'BALANCED APPROACH'
 Kazakhstan's problems mirror those experienced by other
emerging economies over the past year and some have imposed more
stringent capital controls in response, prompting warnings of a
global ""currency war"".
 Marchenko, who has said the tenge would not be allowed to
appreciate to 140 against the dollar this year, said it was in
the interests of ""the entire economy"" to contain appreciation.
 ""There needs to be a balanced approach. This is why we have
been buying up dollars; to prevent the tenge from strengthening
too fast,"" he said.
 During the meeting, Masimov did not offer an alternative
strategy to curb the currency's appreciation.
 A currency dealer at Halyk Bank, Kazakhstan's second-largest
lender by assets, said he believed the central bank was pursuing
a ""balanced"" policy that had so far helped to curb tenge growth.
 ""The tenge has appreciated by just 0.7 percent so far this
year. This is pretty smooth,"" he said.
 HSBC's Morozov added: ""It's peanuts. It cannot be viewed as
damaging to the economy.""
 Kazakhstan is forecasting economic growth of 5 percent this
year, versus 7 percent in 2010, and on Wednesday raised its
forecast for industrial output growth to 4.8 percent, citing
strong growth in mining and processing. [ID:nLDE71F028]
 Inflation accelerated to 1.7 percent month on month in
January from 0.7 percent in the previous month, driven by higher
food prices. The government is targeting inflation of between 6
percent and 8 percent in each of the next five years.
 Marchenko said Kazakhstan's total international reserves,
which include the National Fund replenished by windfall revenues
from oil exports, had grown to more than $63 billion as of Feb.
14 from less than $59 billion at the end of last year.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The dollar gained broadly on
Wednesday, supporting a nearly two-week rally against the yen
as U.S. inflation and housing data pressured bond prices.
 U.S. housing starts rose more than expected in January to
their highest rate in four months, and U.S. producer prices
climbed 0.8 percent, which was in line with expectations on a
rise in energy prices. For more, see and
 U.S. Treasury prices turned negative after the data and
further buoyed the appeal of the dollar against the yen,
reaching its highest level in eight weeks. The dollar has
outperformed the yen in 10 of the past 11 sessions as U.S.
Treasury yields factored in inflation. In early New York
trading the dollar was up 0.2 percent at 83.88 yen.
 Analysts aid further rallies in dollar/yen should target
the 84.51 yen resistance level, the high on Dec. 15. Analysts
said a break of 83.09, Monday's low, is required to signal a
short-term peak.
 Sterling fell sharply as investors revised expectations for
a rate rise after the Bank of England downgraded its economic
growth forecast in its quarterly inflation report, even as
consumer prices spiked higher.
 The central bank predicted a bumpy ride for the economy
this year, with its 2011 forecasts for growth lower than in
predictions made in November.
 An improving U.S. economy and higher inflation expectations
have helped push two-year Treasury yields up about 24 basis
points since Feb. 1. Ten-year yields have edged up by about 18
basis points. Higher rates lift the allure of
dollar-denominated assets, particularly against lower yielding
currencies such as the yen.
 The dollar/yen is being supported by rate expectations and
threatened 84 in late November and early December but could not
hold the gains, said Steve Englander, head of G10 strategy at
CitiFX in New York.
 The big impact of the Federal Reserve's second round of
bond buying ""was to make the expected profile of U.S. rates
look like Japanese rates well into 2012,"" he said. ""Now,
markets are backing off sharply from this expectation, and we
are seeing currency markets react to the view that rate
differentials will widen sharply late this year.""
 The dollar/yen is the currency pair most sensitive to
movements in bond yields because both units are competing as
the markets' favored funding currency. Any shift in the yield
curve or rate expectations typically affects both currencies.
 Sterling fell to the day's low of $1.5988, according to
Reuters data, compared with around $1.6140 before the Bank of
England's quarterly report on inflation was released. It also
lost ground against the euro, with the common currency rising
to a session high of 84.34 pence from 83.85 pence.
 ""There were hedge funds and a lot of investors who were
piling on sterling based on interest rate expectations,"" said
Adam Myers, currency strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
""Sterling has now sold off, reacting to those expectations in
the rates market.""
 The euro fell against the dollar the fourth time in five
days and was last at $1.3478, down 0.1 percent.
 ""One suspects that some large speculative players are
positioned with double no-touch options, collecting a pay-out
should the euro never hit $1.33-$1.38 over the next month,""
said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.
 The euro rose against the Swiss franc after the Swiss
government announced steps to deal with a strong franc. It last
traded up 0.4 percent to 1.3090.

 * Says interest rates will have to rise at some stage
 * Government takes steps to help exporters
 * Gov't says monetary response to franc lies with SNB
 
 By Sven Egenter and Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank chief
struck a more relaxed tone on the strength of the franc in an
interview on Wednesday, boosting expectations the bank will not
resist more gains and could raise interest rates this year.
 Swiss National Bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand told
newspaper L'Agefi that the franc was dampening rising
inflationary pressures and said there were no miracle solutions
to its gains as the government announced measures to deal with
the currency's negative impact on exporters.
 While price stability was ensured in the near term, the
Swiss National Bank's inflation forecast from December showed
that interest rates could not stay ultra low in the longer-term,
the paper quoted Hildebrand as saying.
 ""The inflationary pressures have increased, that's true,"" he
said. ""But as they show up mainly through the development of
prices for energy and agriculture commodities the Swiss franc is
shielding Switzerland to a certain degree.""
 Swiss policymakers have been struggling to deal with
strength which saw the franc gain 15 percent against the euro
last year due to its status as a shelter from debt and banking
troubles elsewhere in Europe.
 Even with inflation very low, the SNB was unable to cut
already ultra-low interest rates further and drew criticism
domestically for a costly programme of intervention to limit
further franc gains.
 But still-low inflation is expected to top the Swiss
National Bank's target in 2013 and analysts say that means the
bank will likely have to raise rates<0#FES:>. Leading Swiss bank
UBS has argued that could happen as early as June. 
 Analysts said Hildebrand's comments seemed to take a
slightly more hawkish tone and supported expectations of a rise
in rates. 
 ""He said there are no miracle solutions to the strong franc
and even pointed to one of the advantages, noting that although
inflationary pressures have increased, these have been dampened
by the strong currency,"" said UBS economist Gareth Berry.
 The SNB's benchmark 3-month LIBOR target has been at 0.25
percent since March 2009. 
 
 SQUEALS
 Swiss exporters have squealed as the franc rose some 15
percent against the euro last year to touch a record high of
1.2400 per euro in late December over euro zone debt fears. It
has since weakened, flirting with the 1.32 mark.
 The SNB dropped its pledge to intervene last June, saying
deflationary risks had subsided. It racked up losses of some 21
billion Swiss francs for 2010, mostly due to the declining value
of its currency reserves, prompting harsh criticism of
Hildebrand, including calls he step down.
 The government on Wednesday announced a number of measures
to help firms to deal with the gains, including increased
funding for the tourism industry. [ID:nLDE71F1FO]
 But it repeated any monetary measures were the sole
responsibility of the SNB under its mandate to fight deflation.
 The Swiss franc rose against the dollar  to its
strongest in six days after Hildebrand's comments but slipped
back after the Swiss government measures were announced to trade
down 0.1 percent at 0.9676 at 1246 GMT. [ID:nLDE71E294]
 The SNB aims to ensure price stability in the medium term,
which it defines as inflation rates below 2 percent. At its most
recent policy review last December, the SNB forecast inflation
of just 0.4 percent in 2011.
 Yet the SNB's own gauge for underlying price pressures --
the so-called dynamic factor inflation which takes into account
developments like falling unemployment and financial market data
-- has risen steadily over the last couple of months.
 ""If the scenario materialises, sooner or later we'll have to
normalise rates,"" Hildebrand said.
 The central bank's next monetary policy review is on March
17.

 * King insists no decision taken on when to hike
 * King flags divisions among rate setters

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Matt Falloon and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - New Bank of England forecasts
opened the door on Wednesday for interest rates to rise slowly
in Britain but Governor Mervyn King warned against jumping to
conclusions about when the central bank would pull the trigger.
 The Bank's quarterly inflation report suggested expectations
it will start hiking rates soon from a record low 0.5 percent
were not far off the mark, given that inflation is double its
two percent target and likely to climb further.
 However, there are big divisions on the nine-member Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) and King, striking a distinctly more
dovish tone, said the outlook for the economy and inflation
remained highly uncertain and hard to predict.
 ""Some people are running ahead of themselves and saying that
we are pre-announcing or laying the ground for a rate rise,"" he
said. ""That decision has not been taken and won't be taken until
we get to the next meeting or the following meeting, or it may
be many quarters.""
 The pound fell and interest rate futures rallied after the
report was published as some investors had priced in a more
hawkish outlook for monetary policy following data this week
which showed inflation shot up to 4 percent in January.
 However, analysts still expect a steady tightening of policy
as long as Britain's fledgling recovery takes root.
 ""There is a strong possibility of a rise in interest rates
in the middle part of this year,"" said James Knightley,
economist at ING. ""That said, given our concerns on the growth
story we still believe that rates will not rise as much as the
market anticipates."" 
 Markets have been pricing in a first rate rise in May.
 
 NO HINTS ON TIMING
 King rejected fears the BoE could lose credibility if it did
not act soon to cool price pressures -- an argument often put
forward by MPC hawk Andrew Sentance.
 Inflation has been above target for a whole year, leading
some economists to question the BoE's inflation-fighting zeal.
 King said the Bank was bound to raise rates at some point,
but only if the economy was strong enough to bear it.
 ""We're not in the business of futile gestures, we're in the
business of trying to make a disappassionate analysis of the
balance of risks to inflation in the medium term,"" he said.
 The central bank's February report showed consumer price
inflation spiking up to between 4 and 5 percent in the middle of
this year before falling back to around 1.7 percent in early
2013, a higher forecast profile than in November.
 Those forecasts were based on the assumption that interest
rates would rise to 1 percent by the end of this year, hitting
2.1 percent at the end of 2012.
 ""Under the assumption that Bank rate moves in line with
market interest rates ... the chances of inflation being either
above or below the target in the medium term are judged to be
broadly balanced,"" the report said.
 King himself wrote a letter to the government on Tuesday
saying inflation could fall back into line if rates rise as
markets predict. But, on Wednesday, he insisted the Bank was in
no way endorsing market expectations.
 ""We're not. We never do,"" he said.
 Minutes of January's policy meeting showed two MPC members
voted to raise rates last month, indicating a shift towards a
more hawkish stance. 
 However, there are also those on the MPC who have held a
much more dovish view. Minutes from February's meeting will be
published next week when the vote could have been even tighter.
 The BoE predicted a bumpy ride for the economy this year,
with its 2011 forecasts for growth lower than those in its
November quarterly forecasts, but it is seen picking up to
around 3 percent in the medium term.
 That economic uncertainty leads some analysts to believe
that markets are too hasty in pricing in a May rate rise with
sharp government spending cuts only beginning to bite.
 ""On balance, we feel the first rate hike is most likely to
come in August,"" said Hetal Mehta at Daiwa Capital Markets.

 By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Israel's economy surged in the
last three months of 2010 on strong exports and consumer
spending, likely prompting policymakers to raise interest rates
again this month to contain inflation pressures.
 Gross domestic product grew an annualised 7.8 percent in the
fourth quarter, its quickest pace in four years, the Central
Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday in its first estimate.
 The economy grew 4.5 percent in all of 2010, up from 0.8
percent in 2009. Growth of at least 4 percent is seen in 2011.
 Economists were stunned by the growth estimate in the fourth
quarter, in which the Bank of Israel's own models had forecast a
4.3 to 4.6 percent spurt.
 ""The upward surprise of more than three percentage points is
exceptional in scope,"" said Michael Sarel, head of economic
research at Harel Insurance and Investments. ""There is of course
the possibility that the data are wrong and will be revised
downward."" 
 News of the robust growth comes less than a day after the
bureau said the consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in January
from December and 3.6 percent over 12 months -- above
expectations of a 0.1 percent monthly decline and annual
inflation of 3.3 percent.
 ""The economy is on an upward trend and it means the Bank of
Israel will have to consider more frequent increases to stem the
rise in inflation,"" said Alex Zabezhinsky, chief economist at DS
Securities and Investments.
 In a bid to restrain rising inflation pressures, the central
bank raised the benchmark rate by a quarter-point to 2.25
percent on Jan 24, its seventh such move since August 2009.
 
 STOCKS, SHEKEL GAIN
 The rate hikes so far have had little impact, with Israel's
economy growing at least 3.6 percent in each three-month period
since the third quarter of 2009.
 ""It's amazing. It's higher growth than anyone anticipated.
It's not growth spurred by the government but rather by the
private sector -- by investments. That's the healthiest kind of
growth you can have,"" said Amir Kahanovich, chief economist at
Clal Finance.
 Israel's shekel gained 1.1 percent to a three-week peak of
3.61 to the dollar following the GDP data, prompting the central
bank to intervene to curb its strength, according to dealers.
 It had started to advance from Tuesday's fixing of 3.65
after January CPI data began to spur expectations the central
bank will raise interest rates next week.
 Tel Aviv share indices rose 1.5 to 1.7 percent while
government bond yields rose across the board to reflect faster
rate hikes this year and an increase in inflation expectations.
 In recent weeks, analysts had raised expectations the key
rate would reach 3.5 percent at the end of 2011 from 3 percent.
 Fourth-quarter GDP grew at its fastest rate since an 8
percent jump in the fourth quarter of 2006, when the economy
bounced back from Israel's war with Lebanese Hezbollah.
 Led by spending on cars and other big ticket items, consumer
spending rose 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 from the
previous three months, while government spending increased 5.7
percent. Investment jumped 15.9 percent and exports -- more than
40 percent of Israel's economic activity -- jumped 10.3 percent.
Imports surged 22.5 percent.
 The bureau left its third-quarter GDP growth estimate at an
annualised 4.4 percent but raised second quarter GDP to 5.2
percent from 4.9 percent.
 Excluding the public sector, Israel's economy grew 8.9
percent in the fourth quarter.

 * Export insurance made easier
 * Government says monetary steps are responsibility of SNB
(Adds details)
 ZURICH, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The Swiss government announced
measures on Wednesday to help firms to deal with the strong
Swiss franc, including increased funding for the tourism
industry and support for companies to boost innovation.
 Tourism advertising will get an additional 12 million Swiss
francs ($12.4 million) this year and next, export insurance
should be made easier, and more money will be spent to foster
innovation among export-oriented technology companies, the
government said.
 ""(Government policy) generally shuns interventionist or
market distortionary measures, for example subsidies,"" the
government said in a statement. ""It's fundamentally the
responsibility of the firms to deal with the movements of the
Swiss franc.""
 The franc fell after the government announcement, but pared
losses as market participants decided the measures would not be
enough to stem the currency's strength.
 Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann had flagged
that the government was mulling such measures, which in some
cases extend steps taken during the recession.
 The government said that for structural reasons the franc
was likely to remain strong for some time, and that growth could
be helped via measures such as free trade agreements with
dynamic emerging markets.
 It said that any monetary steps were the responsibility of
the Swiss National Bank.
 The central bank's head, Philipp Hildebrand, said franc
strength is dampening rising inflation pressures from higher
energy and food prices but warned in an interview published in
the Swiss French-language paper L'Agefi on Wednesday that rates
cannot stay ultra low forever.
 Swiss exporters have squealed as the franc, which investors
regard as a safe haven, rallied some 15 percent against the euro
last year to touch a record high of 1.2400 per euro in late
December. It has since weakened, flirting with the 1.32 mark
last week.

 * Report appears to point to steady hikes later this year
 * King more dovish, insists no decision taken on timing
 * BoE Governor flags big divisions among rate setters
 
 (Adds Reuters poll)
 By Matt Falloon and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - New Bank of England forecasts
opened the door on Wednesday for interest rates to rise slowly
later this year but Governor Mervyn King told investors not to
assume the central bank was in any hurry to pull the trigger.
 The Bank's quarterly inflation report suggested market
expectations it could start hiking rates towards the middle of
this year from a record low 0.5 percent were not too far off the
mark, given that inflation is double its 2 percent target.
 However, there are big divisions on the nine-member Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) and King, striking a distinctly more
dovish tone, said the outlook for the economy and inflation
remained highly uncertain and hard to predict.
 ""Some people are running ahead of themselves and saying that
we are pre-announcing or laying the ground for a rate rise,"" he
said. ""That decision has not been taken and won't be taken until
we get to the next meeting or the following meeting, or it may
be many quarters.""
 The pound fell and interest rate futures rallied after the
report was published as some investors had priced in a more
hawkish outlook for monetary policy following data this week
which showed inflation shot up to 4 percent in January.
 However, most analysts still expect a steady tightening of
policy to begin later this year, as long as Britain's fledgling
recovery takes root.
 A Reuters poll of economists pointed to rates rising to 0.75
percent in the final quarter of the year, with 10 out of 50
expecting a move before July.
 ""There is a strong possibility of a rise in interest rates
in the middle part of this year,"" said James Knightley,
economist at ING. ""That said, given our concerns on the growth
story we still believe that rates will not rise as much as the
market anticipates."" 
 Markets have been pricing in a first rate rise in May.
 
 NO HINTS ON TIMING
 King rejected fears the BoE could lose credibility if it did
not act soon to cool price pressures -- an argument often put
forward by MPC hawk Andrew Sentance.
 Inflation has been above target for a whole year, leading
some economists to question the BoE's inflation-fighting zeal.
 King said the Bank was bound to raise rates at some point,
but only if the economy was strong enough to bear it.
 ""We're not in the business of futile gestures, we're in the
business of trying to make a dispassionate analysis of the
balance of risks to inflation in the medium term,"" he said.
 The central bank's February report showed consumer price
inflation spiking up to between 4 and 5 percent in the middle of
this year before falling back to around 1.7 percent in early
2013, a higher forecast profile than in November.
 Those forecasts were based on the assumption that interest
rates would rise to 1 percent by the end of this year, hitting
2.1 percent at the end of 2012.
 ""Under the assumption that Bank rate moves in line with
market interest rates ... the chances of inflation being either
above or below the target in the medium term are judged to be
broadly balanced,"" the report said.
 King himself wrote a letter to the government on Tuesday
saying inflation could fall back into line if rates rise as
markets predict. But, on Wednesday, he insisted the Bank was in
no way endorsing market expectations.
 ""We're not. We never do,"" he said.
 Minutes of January's policy meeting showed two MPC members
voted to raise rates last month, indicating a shift towards a
more hawkish stance. 
 However, there are also those on the MPC who have held a
much more dovish view. Minutes from February's meeting will be
published next week when the vote could have been even tighter.
 The BoE predicted a bumpy ride for the economy this year,
with its 2011 forecasts for growth lower than those in its
November quarterly forecasts, but it is seen picking up to
around 3 percent in the medium term.
 That economic uncertainty leads some analysts to believe
that markets are too hasty in pricing in an early rate rise,
with sharp government spending cuts only beginning to bite.
 ""On balance, we feel the first rate hike is most likely to
come in August,"" said Hetal Mehta at Daiwa Capital Markets.

(Recasts, adds quote, updates prices)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the Swiss
franc on Wednesday after the Swiss government announced steps to
deal with a strong franc, while sterling fell as the Bank of
England dampened hawkish interest rate expectations.
 Sterling  fell to the day's low of $1.6040, compared
with around $1.6140 before the Bank of England's quarterly
report on inflation was released. It also lost ground against
the euro, with the common currency rising to a session high of
84.29 pence  from 83.85 pence.
 The euro also rose against the Swiss franc ,
jumping 85 pips to 1.3130 francs in a knee-jerk reaction after
the Swiss government said it was taking measures to deal with a
strong currency by providing support to exporters. The single
currency later pulled back to 1.3070 francs. [ID:nWEB9476]
 ""The Swiss government has been making noises about franc
strength, but they have a difficult balancing act,"" said Jeremy
Stretch, currency strategist at CIBC.
 ""Many areas of the Swiss economy are under pressure due to
the strong currency but they must be careful not to tread on the
toes of the Swiss National Bank.""
 The government also said that any monetary steps were the
responsibility of the Swiss National Bank.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.3510
, helped by buying from an Asian sovereign, and supported
above $1.3483, the 38.2 percent retracement of the January to
February rally. 
 The euro also drew some support from Portugal's smooth
buyback of bonds, although worries about when policymakers will
find a durable solution to the euro zone's year-long sovereign
debt problems remain in play.
 That is likely to keep the common currency rangebound.
 ""One suspects that some large speculative players are
positioned with double no-touch options, collecting a pay-out
should the euro never hit $1.33-$1.38 over the next month,"" said
Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.
 
 STERLING SLIDES
 Sterling fell sharply as investors revised expectations for
a rate rise after the BoE downgraded its economic growth
forecast in its quarterly inflation report, even as consumer
prices spiked higher. The central bank predicted a bumpy ride
for the economy this year, with its 2011 forecasts for growth
lower than in predictions made in November. [ID:nBELGDE74P]
 That kept alive risks of stagflation. Implied rates based on
interest rate futures  are now fully pricing the
chance of a quarter point rate hike only in June, pushing it
back after pricing in a rise in May over recent weeks.
 ""There were hedge funds and a lot of investors who were
piling on sterling based on interest rate expectations,"" said
Adam Myers, currency strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
 ""Sterling has now sold off, reacting to those expectations
in the rates market.""
 The dollar index <.DXY> was steady at 78.529 as markets
awaited the release of policy minutes from the Federal Open
Market Committee meeting held at the end of January. January
housing starts and producer price data would also give investors
an idea about how the U.S. economy is performing.
 The greenback held its ground against the yen, supported by
firm U.S. Treasury yields, and was set to test the ceiling of a
long-held range.

Reuters Insider http://link.reuters.com/pun97r

 The dollar traded steady at 83.75 yen , near its
eight-week high of 83.93 yen marked on Tuesday. The two-year
Treasury yield  hit a nine-month high near 0.9 percent
on Tuesday, but has since retreated.
 Its correlation with dollar/yen broke down late last year
but was showing signs of re-establishing itself. The currency
pair's one-month correlation with the U.S. two-year yield has
risen to around 0.43 percent from negative territory earlier
this month.

 MOSCOW, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank on
Wednesday picked Sergei Shvetsov, the man in charge of open
market operations on money and currency markets, as its new
deputy chairman.
 Market participants welcomed the appointment but said it was
unlikely to have a big impact on policy.
 ""This is very positive news for the market. Shvetsov is very
perceptive to the market's reaction ... He has a 'good ear'.
That is, he listens to market participants,"" said Alexander

 Shvetsov, 41, joined the central bank's board of directors
in February 2009 when Russia announced the end of a so-called

director of the division for operations on financial markets.

 Shvetsov takes over the position left vacant when Konstantin
Korishchenko moved to MICEX exchange during the height of the

 Shvetsov was unavailable for comment.

 By Matt Falloon and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - British inflation is just as
likely to be above or below target in two years if interest
rates rise as markets expect, the Bank of England said on
Wednesday, opening the door to tighter monetary policy.
 But BoE Governor Mervyn King insisted that no decision about
when to raise rates had been taken.
 ""Some people are running ahead of themselves and saying that
we are pre-announcing or laying the ground for a rate rise,""
King told a news conference. ""That decision has not been taken
and won't be taken until we get to the next meeting or the
following meeting, or it may be many quarters.""
 The Bank's inflation report supported expectations the BoE
will start hiking rates soon from a record low 0.5 percent,
possibly as soon as May, given that inflation is double its 2
percent target and likely to climb further.
 The central bank's February report showed consumer price
inflation spiking up to between 4 and 5 percent in the middle of
this year before falling back to around 1.7 percent in early
2013, a higher forecast profile than in November.
 Rising price pressures have already prompted investors to
bet on a series of UK rate hikes this year.
 But having jumped on Tuesday after data showed UK inflation
rose to 4 percent in January and King wrote a letter to the
government saying price pressures could fall into line if rates
rise as markets predict, the pound fell back after King began
speaking.
 ""It looks as though markets may have over-interpreted King's
line on inflation in yesterday's letter to the Chancellor,"" said
Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. ""The picture painted by the
inflation report is balanced and emphasises the uncertainties.""
 The Bank said its forecasts were based on the assumption
that interest rates would rise to 1 percent by the end of this
year, hitting 2.1 percent at the end of 2012.
 ""Our judgment is that along that market path of interest
rates the risks to inflation in the medium term are broadly
balanced around the target,"" King said.
 But he stressed that the central bank was not in the
business of endorsing market expectations.
 
 DIFFERING VIEWS
 King admitted there were sharply differing views on the
Monetary Policy Council of interest rate setters.
 ""There remains a wider than usual range of views among
Committee members over the outlook for inflation,"" he said.
 Minutes to January's policy meeting showed two MPC members
voted to raise rates that month, indicating a shift towards a
more hawkish stance. The evidence from February's meeting will
be published next week when the vote could have been even
tighter.
 The Monetary Policy Committee predicted a bumpy ride for the
economy this year, with its 2011 forecasts for growth lower than
those in its November quarterly forecasts, but it is seen
picking up to around 3 percent in the medium term.
 ""Expansionary monetary policy, combined with further growth
in global demand and the past deprecation of sterling should
ensure that the recovery in the UK is maintained,"" the BoE said.
 ""But the continuing fiscal consolidation and squeeze on
households' purchasing power are likely to act as a brake.""
 That economic uncertainty led some economists to believe
that markets are too hasty in pricing in a May rate rise with
sharp government spending cuts only beginning to bite.
 ""We still think a move as early as May is less likely than
one in H211 as the Bank will be keen to assess, for example,
what impact the aggressive fiscal retrenchment will have on
activity before it tightens monetary policy,"" said Hetal Mehta
at Daiwa Capital Markets. ""On balance, we feel the first rate
hike is most likely to come in August.""

(Adds quotes, details, graphic)
 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday
debate in Japan over next fiscal year's budget and social
welfare reform are not key triggers for the country's sovereign
rating, but the government needs to put fiscal reform plans into
place before domestic savings dry up.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan is struggling to win support for
his policies from opposition parties in a divided parliament.
But while political wrangling is a concern, it is too early to
say that that the political process has broken down completely,
Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia Pacific sovereigns at Fitch, told
Reuters in an interview.
 Fitch reaffirmed its AA minus rating on Japan with a stable
outlook, which is supported by Japan's ability to fund its debt
at low yields by tapping large domestic savings.
 In the medium term, domestic savings are likely to fall due
to an ageing population, so Japan needs to take action on its
debt burden before that, according to Fitch.
 ""It wouldn't send a positive signal about the quality of
fiscal policy making,"" Colquhoun said, when asked about the
chance the government would not be able to pass the budget for
next fiscal year.
 ""That said, I don't see it as a key ratings trigger. More
medium-term considerations are what we'd be looking at.""
 Last month, Standard & Poor's cut Japan's rating by one
notch to AA minus, three levels below the top grade, saying
Tokyo lacked a coherent plan to tackle mounting debt.
 S&P's downgrade puts its credit rating on Japan one notch
below Moody's Investors Service but at the same level as Fitch,
which last downgraded Japan in 2002.
 Moody's warned last week that a lack of success on fiscal
reform would have a negative impact on Japan's credit rating.
 Colquhoun's comments suggest that of the three ratings
agencies Fitch is more tolerant of the Japanese government's
ability to stick to a timetable in the near term, because it
could be several years before Japan can no longer rely on its
large pool of domestic savings.
 Kan has staked his career on overhauling the social security
system and raising a 5 percent sales tax. The government has set
itself deadlines in April and June to lay out its plans.
 Raising the sales tax alone won't be a ""magic bullet"", but
it's important to see the details of the government's plans,
Colquhoun said.
 The government is also trying to pass next fiscal year's
budget before the end of next month, but faces a divided
parliament where opposition parties threaten to block bills to
force Kan to resign or call a snap election.
 The prospect of an election would not be key to Japan's
sovereign outlook, Colquhoun said, partly because many political
parties recognise the need for fiscal reform.
 ""What gives me some confidence is the main opposition
Liberal Democratic Party and the current government under Kan
are both fiscally hawkish,"" Colquhoun said.
 ""Cooperation appears to be stymied by politics. Politics is
the key focus for us this year.""
 Economists and rating agencies have long warned that Japan
will have no choice but to reduce its debt burden which, at
twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, is the worst among
industrialised nations.
 Domestic investors hold 95 percent of Japan's outstanding
debt, which has kept yields low when compared with other
countries with high debts.
 That is why a recent rise in Japanese government bond yields
is not a cause for concern, Colquhoun said.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Wednesday
on optimism about a strong outlook for corporate earnings, while
expectations for higher interest rates in the UK lifted sterling
and the euro gained against the dollar on sovereign demand.
 The MSCI world equity index was up 0.3 percent at 344.08,
edging close to a high hit earlier this month of 344.64 which
marked its strongest since August 2008.
 European stocks were up 0.5 percent, extending a rally into
a fourth straight session after shares closed at a fresh
29-month high on Tuesday, with beverage firms gaining after
Heineken beat market forecasts for 2010 earnings.
 ""There is a growing confidence in the outlook for the global
economy. The recovery looks like it is being transformed into a
sustainable expansion and that does mean that the outlook for
earnings is very positive,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist
at Brewin Dolphin.
 The gains followed an earlier jump in Japan's Nikkei average
to a nine-month high, helped by a weaker yen and buying by
foreign investors.
 Focus in foreign exchange markets was on sterling after a
jump in British inflation prompted Bank of England Governor
Mervyn King to acknowledge that interest rates might rise more
rapidly than economists had expected.
 Sterling was up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.6150
and hovered near a five-and-a-half month high against a currency
basket on anticipation the Bank of England will offer a hawkish
outlook on UK interest rates later on Wednesday.
 UK consumer price inflation surged to a two-year high of 4.0
percent from 3.7 percent in December, providing an awkward
backdrop for the central bank's updated quarterly growth and
inflation forecasts on Wednesday.
 The euro was up 0.5 percent against the dollar at $1.3552,
lifted by Asian central bank buying.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies at 78.268.
 
 OIL GAINS
 U.S. oil prices recovered to nearly $85 a barrel, trading up
43 cents at $84.75, lifted by an unexpected fall in weekly crude
stocks, while London Brent rose past $102, underpinned by
continuing protests in the Middle East.
 Traders will scour the Energy Information Administration's
(EIA) report, to be unveiled later, for confirmation of the
decline in U.S. weekly crude inventories seen in Tuesday's data
from the American Petroleum Institute (API).
 Gold prices were up 0.3 percent on the day at $1,377.11,
close to a four-week high and helped by a decline in the dollar
versus the euro, with the market underpinned by concerns
inflation may be set to rise in the medium term.
 The March Bund future was 7 ticks higher at 122.75, while
German government bond yields were steady ahead of a 10-year
debt auction.
 Portugal's one-year borrowing costs are expected to jump in
the T-bill auction on Wednesday on renewed concerns the
debt-laden country may need a bailout, but the yield should stay
below record levels seen in December. 
 ""The auctions are perhaps getting a little bit more
attention than they warrant as there haven't been any problems
for a while,"" said IDEA Global bond strategist Everett Brown. 
 ""Ironically the worst auctions recently have been in
Germany.""
 Emerging stocks were up 0.1 percent.

 * Some see risk of fall in sterling
 * Dollar/yen holds near eight-week highs
 By Ian Chua and Hideyki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Sterling held broad gains on
Wednesday as rising UK inflation cemented expectations of an early
rate hike, while the dollar looked well placed to test the
ceiling of a long-held range against the yen after hitting an
eight-week high.
 Sterling rallied to a 5-½ month peak against a currency
basket after data showing UK inflation jumped to twice
the Bank of England's target prompted central bank governor
Mervyn King to acknowledge that interest rates might rise more
rapidly than economists had expected.
 It last traded at $1.6157, having peaked at a high
of $1.6170 on Tuesday. The pound has gained some 3 percent
against the greenback so far this year.
 UK inflation will remain front and centre with the BoE's
inflation report due at 1030 GMT the next focus.
 ""King's comments sound as if he is considering an early rate
hike. The inflation report will likely to be in line with his
comments,"" said Yuuki Sakasai, a strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ""But we do think that King is likely to use his news
conference later on to warn against aggressively pricing in rate
hikes. So the pound could gain on the report and fall on King's
comments. On the whole we think risk is skewed to the downside,""
he said, adding that the pound could fall to around $1.60.
 Money markets have already priced in three rate hikes by the
end of the year, a scenario some market players think is
excessive given some weak spots in the UK economy, which posted a
surprise contraction in the Oct-Dec quarter.
 ""Higher inflation is increasing the prospects of interest
rate hikes, but the fear of higher interest rates is a problem
since UK consumers are highly leveraged,"" BNP Paribas analysts
wrote in a report.
 ""Nevertheless, a GBP/USD rebound to the upper end of the
recent trading range in the 1.6180 area is anticipated and we
would view this as a selling opportunity.""
 Against the yen, the pound was firm near a six-month peak hit
on Tuesday. It changed hands at 135.30 yen, a hair below
Tuesday's high of 135.45 yen.
 Japanese retail traders who take speculative positions
through margin trading are selling into the rally, however,
doubling their net short positions in sterling on Tuesday to a
record high of 451 million pounds.
 YEN UNDER PRESSURE
 While inflation is not yet a problem in the United States, a
recent string of upbeat data has fuelled gains in U.S. Treasury
yields, helping drive the greenback higher against the yen.
 The two-year Treasury yield hit a nine-month high
near 0.9 percent on Tuesday, but retreated after retail sales
slowed in January.
 The spread over Japan's two-year yield reached an eight month
high around 64 basis points last week and was last at 59 bps.
 The dollar/yen correlation broke down late last year. Many
traders attributed this to irregular flows around the start of
2011, while some blamed flows related to derivative losses.
 But some market players say correlation appears to be coming
back, with the currency pair's one-month correlation with the
U.S. two-year yield rising back to around 0.55 from negative
earlier this month.
 The dollar held firm against the yen, after rising steadily
in the past nine sessions. It traded at 83.75 yen, near an
eight-week high of 83.93 yen marked on Tuesday.
 Traders see more upside in the dollar, although it faces
stiff chart resistance at the highs of 84.40 to 84.51 hit in
November and December.
 ""USD/JPY took out resistance at 83.68, and one now starts to
look at levels such as 84.51 and even the 200-dma is coming into
focus at 85.14. However, there is a lot of ground to cover
between here and there,"" said David Watt, a strategist at RBC
Capital Markets.
 The euro also gained 0.3 percent in Asia to $1.3533, helped
by buying from real money players, and supported above $1.3483,
the 38.2 percent retracement of the January to February rally.
 Renewed worries about euro zone sovereign debt problems
have prompted investors to reassess the Jan-Feb rally, when the
euro rose from a low of $1.2860 to a high of $1.3862.

 By Ian Chua and Ayai Tomisawa	
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Feb 16 (REUTERS) - Sterling rose in Asia on
Wednesday as accelerating inflation in Britain cemented
expectations of an early interest rate rise, while a weaker
yen helped to send Japanese stocks to their highest level since
May. 
 Shares elsewhere in Asia fell slightly
and U.S. oil prices recovered to nearly $85 a barrel partly due
to a surprise drop in weekly crude stocks. 
 Stocks in emerging markets in Asia have underperformed
those in developed countries this year. Underscoring that trend,
MSCI's Japan share index has risen around 7.5
percent this year, compared with a drop of more than 2 percent
in MSCI's Asia Pacific share index excluding Japan. 
 But some analysts remain sceptical that such a trend
will continue for long. 
 Rodrigo Zorrilla, head of markets Asia-Pacific,
Citigroup, said some $10 billion of funds had moved from
emerging market dedicated funds to the United States during the
first two weeks of February. 
 ""The question everybody is asking is whether that is
the reversal of a trend of the bullish emerging market story or
is that just a rebalancing of portfolio,"" Zorrilla said, adding
that he supported the second view. 
 ""We think the fundamentals are still very strong in
Asia. And while there are some scares in the market relating to
the political issues in the Middle East and inflation concerns
around the world, as soon as the dust settles we will see that
trend (of outflows) to slow down and stop."" 
 
 INFLATION REPORT EYED 
 Sterling rallied to a 5-1/2 month peak against a
currency basket after data on Tuesday showed inflation in
Britain jumped to 4 percent, twice the Bank of England's target,
prompting Governor Mervyn King to acknowledge that rates might
rise more rapidly than economists had expected. 
 Analysts now expect a rate rise in May and the next market
focus is the BoE's inflation report due at 1030 GMT. 
 Yuuki Sakasai, a strategist at Barclays Capital, said
the inflation report would support King's comments overnight
that suggested an early rate increase. 
""But we do think that King is likely to use his news
conference later on to warn against aggressively pricing in rate
hikes. So the pound could gain on the report and fall on King's
comments. On the whole we think risk is skewed to the downside,""
he said, adding that the pound could fall to around $1.60. 
 Sterling last traded at around $1.6150 ,
compared with a high of $1.6170 overnight. The pound
has gained some 3 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this
year . 
 The euro edged up against the dollar, standing at around
$1.3520 as of 0544 GMT. 
 Against the yen, the dollar last traded at around
83.75 , not far from an eight-week high of around 83.90
yen hit the previous day, helped by the recent rise in
U.S. Treasury yields. 
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average extended gains and
rose to a nine-month high as a softer yen lifted
exporters. It closed up 0.57 percent at 10,808.29. A
weaker yen makes Japanese exports cheaper and boosts company
profits. 
 ""It's a weaker yen that's lifting sentiment, but foreign
investors are also picking up domestic-demand stocks,"" said
Shinichiro Matsushita, a market analyst at Daiwa Securities,
adding that financials were attracting foreign interest due to
the Nikkei's strong performance. 
 The index has gained some 18 percent since November
when foreigners began snapping up lagging Tokyo stocks, helped
by a shift in market focus to developed economies from emerging
ones. 
 High trade volumes also lifted the mood. The Tokyo stock
exchange's first section has seen more than 2.0 billion shares
change hands for seven consecutive sessions.	
 MSCI's Asia Pacific share index excluding Japan
was down 0.13 percent, while Hong Kong
stocks rose 0.6 percent, recovering from the previous
session's 1 percent dip as investors sought bargains among
heavy-weighted financials. 
 The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI)
fell 0.9 percent. The Shanghai Composite
, which rallied earlier this week on hopes for
milder inflation in China, was up 0.5 percent as of 0548
GMT. 
 In Australia, BHP Billiton , the world's
biggest miner, said it planned to pour $80 billion into
expansions over the next five years and return cash to investors
rather than chase ambitious takeovers, after nearly doubling its
first-half profit to a record. 
 After having rallied 9 percent to a 33-month high in recent
weeks, shares of the market leader BHP fell 1.6
percent after posting results. But Australia's benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index was little changed as banking shares
weighed on the broader market. 
 U.S. crude for March delivery gained 0.25
percent to $84.56 a barrel by 0550 GMT, while brent crude
for April delivery rebounded to near $102 a barrel,
underpinned by continued protests in the Middle East.

 By Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is likely to
smooth the way for higher interest rates with its quarterly
economic forecasts on Wednesday, to tackle inflation that is
currently running at double its 2 percent target.
 But the central bank's Inflation Report forecasts will also
highlight the huge uncertainty about where the economy is
heading and policymakers are likely to be reluctant to set
themselves too rigid a course for monetary tightening.
 The BoE has held interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent
for almost two years but investors are betting the central bank
will start raising rates as early as May to bring inflation back
to target over its two-year forecast horizon.
 In an obligatory open letter to the government on Tuesday,
BoE Governor Mervyn King said inflation was likely to rise to
between 4-5 percent in the short term and that it was just as
likely to be above target as below it in two to three years time
if interest rates rise in line with market expectations.
 ""The Governor's letter seems to endorse market pricing for
the Monetary Policy Committee to hike soon,"" said Citi economist
Michael Saunders. 
 Money markets are pricing in rates at 1.25 percent by the
end of this year, and in general expect a faster pace of
tightening over the next two years than they did in November.
 However, most City economists do not expect the central bank
to start tightening policy until much later this year,
highlighting the dilemma facing policymakers of how to tackle
rising price pressures without derailing the economic recovery.
 Consumer price inflation hit a two-year high of 4.0 percent
in January, up from 3.7 percent in December.
 ""The committee has no choice but to establish its
credibility by sounding hawkish,"" said Amit Kara, economist at
UBS. 
 The BoE produces two forecasts for inflation -- one based on
market interest rate expectations and one that assumes interest
rates remain at 0.5 percent. 
 Analysts reckon that near-term inflation forecasts on both
measures will be revised upwards to reflect a greater knock-on
impact of rising commodity prices and value-added tax.
 The November forecasts envisaged inflation falling to a
modal 1.45 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on market
rate expectations, and 1.59 percent based on unchanged policy.
 ""For the first time in a while, assessing what happens to
monetary policy will depend on both fan charts,"" said Alan
Clarke, economist at BNP Paribas.
 
 GROWTH RISKS
 The BoE's outlook for growth will also play a key role in
determining when policymakers start to withdraw monetary
stimulus, and so far it has maintained there is enough slack in
the economy to keep inflation in check further down the line.
 The central bank will almost certainly have to revise down
its near-term forecasts for GDP from November because of the
shock 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter decline in economic output
in the final three months of 2010.
 The contraction was mainly due to heavy snowfall in
December, and there are signs that activity rebounded quickly in
January. 
 But the BoE may still have to lower its medium-term outlook
for growth, lessening the urgency for the MPC to take action on
inflation. 
 The Bank's modal projection for year-on-year GDP growth in
Q4 2010 was 3.05 percent -- almost double a first official
estimate of 1.7 percent growth.
 ""That said, most MPC members have clearly become more
worried about the damage to credibility that is being wrought by
the persistent overshooting of the inflation target,"" said Simon
Hayes, economist at Barclays Capital.
 ""In that case, the report will provide a vehicle to prepare
financial markets, firms and households for a rate hike,
probably within the next few months.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - World stocks edged off recent
30-month highs on Tuesday and oil prices retreated as
disappointing retail sales in the United States and persistent
inflationary pressures in China dented optimism about the
global economic outlook.
 The U.S. dollar climbed to an eight-week high against the
yen, lifted by a jump in two-year Treasury yields  to
their highest since last May. Rising bond yields have pushed
the dollar up about 3 percent versus the yen over the last two
weeks.
 Sales at U.S. retailers rose by a less-than-forecast 0.3
percent in January, partly due to harsh winter weather, though
economists said the underlying trend of improved spending
remained intact. [ID:nN15164973]
 ""The softer data will see the growth bulls marginally lower
forecasts for first-quarter retail activity, but the market
impact will be softened as economists give room for a rebound
after weather improves,"" said Avery Shenfeld, CIBC chief
economist in Toronto.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.1
percent, holding near last week's 30-month highs.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 41.55
points, or 0.34 percent, at 12,226.64. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was down 4.31 points, or 0.32 percent, at
1,328.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 12.83
points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,804.35. Volume remained light,
following the slowest trading day in U.S. markets this year.
 Brent crude for April delivery  fell $1.44 to settle
at $101.64 a barrel, after hitting a 28-month peak at $104.30
on Monday. U.S. crude  for March delivery fell 49 cents
to settle at $84.32 a barrel, ahead of weekly oil inventory
data expected to show U.S. crude oil stocks rose last week.
 While protests in Iran and other Middle East countries
remained a concern, analysts also looked for some unwinding of
the geopolitical fear premium that emerged during Egypt's
protests.
 ""There may be some unwinding of the fear premium on overall
risk reduction as the Middle East hasn't gotten out of control
yet and traders also are getting ready for another expected
rise in U.S. oil supplies,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest
Research in Chicago.
 Data overnight showed Chinese inflation came in lower than
expected at 4.9 percent in the year to January, but price
pressures excluding food were their strongest in at least a
decade and could force the central bank to keep tightening
monetary policy. [ID:nTOE71E01Y]
 In Britain, inflation jumped to twice the Bank of England's
target in January, prompting BoE Governor Mervyn King to
acknowledge that interest rates might rise more rapidly than
economists had expected.
 Rising inflation worries pushed gold to a four-week high,
while the prospects of more tightening in China pushed copper
off record highs in its biggest one-day slide in three weeks.
 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 The dollar climbed to 83.93 yen  on trading
platform EBS, the highest level since mid-December, lifted by
the recent rise in bond yields. It was last up 0.6 percent at
83.76 yen.
 ""If the upswing in Treasury yields continues, it is not
unreasonable that we see further upside for the dollar against
the yen,"" said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC
Capital Markets in Toronto. ""If risk appetites improve, that
will also present further downside for the yen.""
 The dollar was little changed versus the euro 
after Europe moved closer to a deal on tackling its debt crisis
and officials said there would be additional meetings to try to
reach an accord. [ID:nLDE71E289]
 Uncertainty over a rescue package has caused spreads
between peripheral nation bond yields and German benchmarks to
widen in recent days. Greece bonds were a notable
underperformer on Tuesday after data showed its recession
deepened in the last months of 2010.
 The euro zone ended last year with stable economic growth,
but disappointed those hoping for a faster recovery as
expansion in the three largest nations fell short of forecasts,
and Greece and Portugal contracted. But German data and a
sentiment indicator suggested the country's economic recovery
remained on track.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed against the
yen to its highest in eight weeks on Tuesday, boosted by the
recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, with more gains seen
likely if bond markets continue to factor in inflation.
 The greenback has gained against the yen in nine of the
past 10 sessions, rising more than 2 percent this month.
Analysts at Action Forex said Tuesday's rise in the currency
pair signified that the rebound from 80.93 yen, the Jan. 3 low,
has resumed and intraday bias has shifted to the upside.
 Further rallies in dollar/yen should target the 84.51 yen
resistance, the high on Dec. 15. On the downside, analysts said
a break of Monday's 83.09 low is required to signal a
short-term peak. Otherwise, the outlook remains bullish, Action
Forex said.
 Two-year Treasury yields have risen more than 20 basis
points since Feb. 1, while benchmark rates have edged up by
more than 17 basis points, seemingly driven by inflation
expectations amid an improving U.S. economy. That has increased
the appeal of dollar assets, especially against another
low-yielding currency such as the yen.
 ""The relationship between dollar/yen and U.S. yields has
come back into play,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas
G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.
 Dollar/yen is the currency pair most sensitive to movements
in bond yields because both units are competing as the markets'
favored funding unit. Any shift in the yield curve or rate
expectations should have an impact on both currencies.

double-click on [ID:nN15149987].
 Upadhyaya said the correlation between two-year yields and
dollar/yen broke down in December, but has come back in late
January and February and has underpinned dollar/yen.
 On Tuesday, the correlation between dollar/yen and
benchmark 10-year yields were at a robust 70 percent, according
to Reuters data.
 The return of that correlation, Upadhyaya noted, was partly
precipitated by news from China on Tuesday showing new yuan
loans, money supply and headline consumer prices were better
than expected. [ID:nTOE71E06O]
 ""That reduces expectations in the market that China may
have to tighten more aggressively ... diminishing risk aversion
and spurring some selling in the yen"" as a a funder of risk
assets, Upadhyaya said.
 In late afternoon trading, the dollar rose 0.6 percent
versus the yen to 83.76, hitting an eight-week high at 83.93
yen .
 Traders said there has been good interest to buy dollar/yen
volatility in the options market the past week as the front end
of the curve, specifically three-month vols, which has recently
declined to its lowest in more than 3 years. That suggested
dollar/yen could see some movement in its price the next few
weeks, having been rangebound so far this year.
 Three-month vols fell on Tuesday to 10.00 percent 
after posting gains the last two days.
 At the same time, the euro outperformed the dollar for the
first time in four days on Tuesday, bouncing from a three-week
low. But the gains could be fleeting as technical factors point
to losses.
 The euro rose above $1.35 and traded off a 3-week low of
$1.3428 on Monday. The euro  was last little changed
against the dollar at $1.3488.
 Scotia Capital's chief currency strategist Camilla Sutton
said near-term technicals are warning of the potential for
further downside for the euro and suggest a test down to
$1.3425 is likely.
 The euro faces obstacles from several directions, with
sovereign debt risk and interest rate differentials working
decidedly against the euro zone single currency.
 Europe moved closer on Tuesday to a deal on tackling its
debt crisis, but time is tight to agree on a comprehensive
package by the end of March and officials announced extra
meetings to boost chances of reaching an accord.
[ID:nLDE71E289]
 Sterling  rallied 0.6 percent against the dollar to
$1.6128 after data showed for the thirteenth consecutive month
the UK's inflation rate is above the upper target of the Bank
of England. This fueled speculation rates will rise in the near
term as the BoE seeks to contain price pressures.

 HAVANA, Feb 15 (Reuters) - It is 50 years since the last
U.S.-backed invasion of Cuba but the island's communist leaders
believe another one has begun -- not on the shores of the Bay
of Pigs as in 1961, but in the virtual world of the Internet.
 Cuba fears ""cyberdissidents"" could use Twitter, Facebook
and other online social networks to undermine the government.
Its concern has taken on added significance since the same
communication tools were used by protesters in Egypt to help
topple long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak last week.
 A leaked video recently posted on the web
(http://vimeo.com/19402730) shows a Cuban intelligence Internet
expert telling interior ministry officials that the new cyber
opposition is a more serious threat than the island's
traditional dissidents.
 The authorities are worried about people like Claudia
Cadelo, a frail-looking 27-year teacher of French who created
Octavo Cerco (www.octavocerco.blogspot.com), one of about 30
blogs critical of the government written inside Cuba.
 ""Social networks have become a new weapon for civil
society,"" she told Reuters in an interview. ""They don't want
the social networks to spread because they are aware of the
danger that poses to a totalitarian government which hides the
truth from its people."".
 Given Cuba's low rate of Internet connectivity, the tweets
Cadelo types into her mobile phone don't reach many Cubans. But
that could change as Cuba gains access to broadband Internet
and mulls the pros and cons of granting wider access.
 After initially blocking public access to some critical
websites, the Cuban government has switched strategy and
unleashed an anti-dissident counter-attack by a legion of some
1,000 pro-government ""revolutionary"" bloggers.
 From his office in the headquarters of Cuba's state
telephone company ETECSA, journalist and blogger Manuel
Henriquez is on the front lines of that official offensive.
 ""There is evidently an intention to attack Cuba through the
Internet. And of course Cuba has the right to defend itself,""
said the 47-year-old author of the blog Cambios en Cuba
(http://cambiosencuba.blogspot.com).
 ""It is an old war and this is its latest expression. What
these (opposition) bloggers are looking for is to demonize the
country, create an image of a repression that doesn't exist and
later on allows justifying laws and blockades.""
 Bloggers like Henriquez take aim at Cuba's cyberdissidents,
led by prominent critic Yoani Sanchez and her Generacion Y blog
(http://www.desdecuba.com/generaciony/). They accuse the
critics of being financed by the U.S. government, Cuba's
ideological foe, and often post damaging rumors about their
personal lives.
 LOW CONNECTIVITY
 Experts say the Internet is offering Cuban dissidents
unprecedented room for political debate, but that the
transforming potential of Twitter and other social networks
depends heavily on connectivity levels.
 In Tunisia, the cradle of recent protests that have rocked
the Arab world, 19 percent of the population was on Facebook,
but Internet access in Cuba is restricted by the government.
 ""It's worth asking what percent of Cubans have regular
Internet access. Access to mobile phones. If those numbers are
low, it's unlikely these are the most effective organizing
channels,"" said Ethan Zuckerman, senior researcher at Harvard
University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
 Wilfredo Cancio, a Cuban exile journalist who publishes a
Cuban affairs web site Cafe Fuerte (http://cafefuerte.com/) in
Miami sees a ""Cold War"" mentality in the Cuban government's
declared digital offensive against cyber opponents.
 ""I think the government is betting on winning this battle,
above all from the control perspective,"" he said.
 Cuba, the Caribbean's biggest island, has a population of
11 million, and last reported 1.6 million people online, but
they mostly only have access to a government-sanctioned
intranet that does not permit links to Twitter or Facebook.
 Mobile telephony has grown dramatically since it was
legalized three years ago, but costs are high for ordinary
Cubans. Cadelo says she pays the equivalent of $1 every time
she tweets by sending a text message to a number in Britain.
 A fiber-optic submarine cable hooking Cuba to its socialist
ally Venezuela could soon increase the island's data transfer
speed by 3,000 times.
 Cuba's government says the long-standing U.S. embargo has
been the main obstacle to Internet penetration and that there
are no ""political obstacles"" to opening up the Internet to the
broader public. But they say for the time being they cannot
afford to install the needed wider infrastructure.
 Ted Henken, a Cuba analyst at City University of New York,
thinks Cuban authorities may try to emulate the Chinese model
of opening up the Internet while controlling information flow.
 ""Using these technologies to spark anti-government protests
is impossible now given the low penetration, access and use ...
But this is likely to change in the future as the government
tries to benefit economically from broadband,"" he said.
 On the leaked government video, the Cuban Internet expert
said the United States was smuggling satellite phones into Cuba
to provide dissidents with unrestricted access to the web.
 Alan Gross, a U.S. government subcontractor held in Havana
and accused of introducing such devices into Cuba, is awaiting
trial and faces up to 20 years in jail on charges of ""crimes
against the security of the state.""
 In the video, the Cuban official called Gross a
""mercenary"", comparing him to the CIA-backed Cuban exiles who
invaded Cuba at the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961.
 Henriquez, the pro-government blogger, says the United
States is trying to export a cyber rebellion model promoted in
places like Iran. ""But it isn't going to work whether there is
Internet or not. A Twitter message isn't itself a reason to
mobilize,"" he said.
 Cadelo, however, says it is just a matter of time. ""The
Internet is going to get to the people. They can't avoid that.
A war against the Internet is a lost war,"" she said.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2011 03:36PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-US says G20 should look at capital flows impact," (Adds details, quotes)
 By Glenn Somerville and David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The United States hopes the
Group of 20 meeting in Paris this weekend will begin coming to
grips with how to handle rapid flows of capital that stoke
inflation and cause currency rate disruptions, a Treasury
official said on Tuesday.
 ""We need a better framework for addressing volatility in
capital inflows,"" a U.S. Treasury Department official who
requested anonymity, told reporters.
 Surges in capital flows ""can complicate macroeconomic
management, contribute to credit booms and busts and risks and
reversals,"" the official said.
 Finance ministers from G20 rich and developing countries
meet in Paris on Friday and Saturday, hoping to advance an
agenda that aims to identify causes of global economic
imbalances and eventually devise policy remedies to fix them.
 There are strains among the G20 members, however, over
issues ranging from revamping the global monetary system to
setting out a menu of measures to gauge whether a particular
country is contributing to imbalances.
 The U.S. official said progress in devising so-called
""indicative guidelines"" for making such a determination was
likely to be limited in Paris but made clear the United States
still sees inflexible currencies, like China's, as an issue.
 ""Belatedly, G20 members need to free up exchange rates to
facilitate adjustment,"" the official said. ""For the global
adjustment process to work all major economies must allow their
currencies to adjust in line with market forces, or risk
imposing excess burdens on others.""
 In response to questions, the official repeated that the
Obama administration considers China's yuan, also called the
renminbi, to be undervalued but suggested it was not the only
inflexible currency.
 The official said that when some countries maintain an
undervalued currency, it makes it hard for others like Brazil
that have floating currencies but are dealing with large and
inflationary capital inflows to apply traditional policy
remedies like higher interest rates.

 * Intraday bias on dollar/yen turns higher
 * Sterling rises on rate hike expectations
 * Euro down versus dollar
(Updates prices, adds quotes, changes byline)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed against the
yen to its highest in eight weeks on Tuesday, boosted by the
recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, with more gains seen
likely if bond markets continue to factor in inflation.
 The greenback has gained against the yen in nine of the
past 10 sessions, rising more than 2 percent this month.
Analysts at Action Forex said Tuesday's rise in the currency
pair signified that the rebound from 80.93 yen, the Jan. 3 low,
has resumed and intraday bias has shifted to the upside.
 Further rallies in dollar/yen should target the 84.51 yen
resistance, the high on Dec. 15. On the downside, analysts said
a break of 83.09, Monday's low, is required to signal a
short-term peak. Otherwise, the outlook remains bullish, Action
Forex said.
 Two-year Treasury yields have risen more than 20 basis
points since Feb. 1, while benchmark rates have edged up by
more than 17 basis points, seemingly driven by inflation
expectations amid an improving U.S. economy. That has increased
the appeal of dollar assets, especially against another
low-yielding currency such as the yen.
 ""The relationship between dollar/yen and U.S. yields has
come back into play,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas
G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.
 Dollar/yen is the currency pair most sensitive to movements
in bond yields because both units are competing as the markets'
favored funding unit. Any shift in the yield curve or rate
expectations should have an impact on both currencies.

double-click on, [ID:nN15149987].
 Upadhyaya said the correlation between two-year yields and
dollar/yen broke down in December, but has come back in late
January and February and has underpinned dollar/yen.
 The return in that correlation, Upadhyaya noted, was partly
precipitated by news from China on Tuesday showing that new
yuan loans, money supply and and consumer prices were better
than expected.
 ""That reduces expectations in the market that China may
have to tighten more aggressively ... diminishing risk aversion
and spurring some selling in the yen"" as a a funder of risk
assets, Upadhyaya said.
 In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar rose 0.7 percent
versus the yen, hitting an 8-week high at 83.91 .
 At the same time, the euro outperformed the dollar for the
first time in four days on Tuesday, bouncing from a three-week
low. But the gains could be fleeting as technical factors point
to losses.
 The euro rose above the pivotal level of $1.35 and traded
off a 3-week low of $1.3428 in the overnight session. The euro
 was last up 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.3517.
 Scotia Capital's chief currency strategist Camilla Sutton
said near-term technicals are warning of the potential of
further downside for the euro and suggest a test down to
$1.3425 is likely.
 The euro faces obstacles from several directions, with
sovereign debt risk and interest rate differentials working
decidedly against the single currency.
 Europe moved closer on Tuesday to a deal on tackling its
debt crisis, but time is tight to agree on a comprehensive
package by the end of March and officials announced extra
meetings to boost chances of reaching an accord.
[ID:nLDE71E289]
Sterling  rallied 0.6 percent against the dollar to
$1.6128 after data showed for the thirteenth consecutive month
the UK's inflation rate is above the upper target of the Bank
of England. This fueled speculation rates will rise in the near
term as the BoE seeks to contain price pressures.

 * New southern currency to retain pound name
 * South Sudan favoured as name of new country

 By Jeremy Clarke
 JUBA, Sudan, Feb 15 (Reuters) - South Sudan will not share
oil revenues with the north after its independence but would pay
pipeline fees and could offer grants to help Khartoum make up
for lost earnings, a southern official said on Tuesday.
 He was setting out the region's stance in negotiations over
how south and north will divide debts and assets and other
burning issues like the position of their shared border after
the split, due to become official in July.
 It was not immediately possible on Tuesday, a public holiday
in the north, to contact northern government officials to see
whether the arrangement would be acceptable in Khartoum.
 South Sudan is due to secede in July after its voters
overwhelmingly chose to separate from the north in a referendum
last month -- a vote promised under a 2005 peace deal that ended
decades of civil war with the north.
 Under the 2005 accord, Khartoum received half of the
revenues from oil found in the south, once pipeline fees and
other costs had been deducted.
 The south is the source of around 75 percent of the 500,000
barrels per day output of oil in Africa's largest country. Oil
has been the lifeblood of both northern and southern economies.
 The only way for the south to get its oil to market
currently lies through the north's pipelines and Red Sea port.
 
 NO MORE 50-50 SHAREOUT
 Pagan Amum, secretary general of the south's ruling Sudan
People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), told journalists in the
southern capital Juba that the half-share arrangement would not
continue after independence.
 He said the south might be able to offer the north grants to
help it cope with the sudden loss in revenues after the south's
departure. ""The notion of sharing wealth will not be there.
There is no continuation, whether 50 percent or anything.
 ""There's going to be an agreement on the south continuing
exporting its oil through the pipeline in northern Sudan and to
Port Sudan, and the south will be paying pipeline fees for
transportation,"" said Amum.
 ""We may be paying a transit fee because now northern Sudan
is going to be a different independent state from the south,"" he
added, without mentioning figures.
 Analysts say alternative plans for a pipeline from South
Sudan to Kenya could take years to build and be very expensive.
 Amum said the north would need time to diversify its economy
to cover the disappearance of revenues originating in the south.
 ""It is suspected that they will come and ask southern Sudan
to grant them some money to be able to meet their needs before
they do that (adjust their economy). We are ready to discuss
that because we are interested in their stability,"" he said.
 Amum confirmed earlier reports that the south would issue
its own currency after the split, and said it would retain the
name of the pound. He said it remained unclear how the north
would redeem the old Sudanese pounds circulating in the south,
given the country's current shortage of hard currency.
 ""They may have difficulty ... as they are losing dollars
also, so it may be a debt ... (We may say) OK, our children will
continue to go to your universities and you pay from that, for
example.""
 Amum said the SPLM leadership had decided it wanted the
territory to retain its name ""South Sudan"" after independence,
but the south's parliament still needed to rule on the issue.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday as
fears eased over Middle East unrest and on uncertainty over
China's monetary policy to fight inflation, while the U.S.
dollar climbed to an eight-week high versus the yen.
 While protests in Iran and other Middle East countries
remained a concern, analysts looked for some unwinding of the
geopolitical fear premium that emerged during Egypt's protests.
For details, see [ID:nHAF546420]
 Weakness in crude weighed on energy shares, dragging major
U.S. stock indexes <.DJI><.SPX> lower. World stocks, as
measured by the MSCI world stocks index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped
0.2 percent, but held near last week's 30-month highs.
 ""I see the dollar's move up from earlier lows pulling down
NYMEX crude futures,"" said Chris Dillman, analyst at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Brent crude for April delivery  dropped 1.6 percent
to $101.53 a barrel, while U.S. crude oil for March delivery
 dropped 0.7 percent to $84.20.
 The dollar climbed as high as 83.93 yen  on
trading platform EBS, the highest level since mid-December, and
was last up 0.6 percent at 83.80 yen.
 U.S. two-year Treasury notes  yields briefly
reached around 0.89 percent, their highest level since last
May. Higher Treasury yields have pushed the dollar up more than
2 percent versus the yen over the last two weeks.
 ""If the upswing in Treasury yields continues, it is not
unreasonable that we see further upside for the dollar against
the yen,"" said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC
Capital Markets in Toronto. ""If risk appetites improve, that
will also present further downside for the yen.""
 Stocks were under pressure after data showed sales at U.S.
retailers rose less than forecast in January and as energy
shares pulled back, creating a breather in the market's recent
rally.
 Despite the softer-than-expected reading, economists said
the underlying trend of improved spending remained intact.
[ID:nN15164973]
 ""The softer data will see the growth bulls marginally lower
forecasts for first-quarter retail activity, but the market
impact will be softened as economists give room for a rebound

economist in Toronto.
 In mid-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> dropped 66.90 points, or 0.55 percent, at 12,201.29. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 6.62 points, or

was off 14.12 points, or 0.50 percent, at 2,803.06.
 EURO STRENGTH
 The dollar slipped versus the euro , which was
boosted by demand from Middle East and Asian investors.
 Europe moved closer to a deal on tackling its debt crisis
on Tuesday, and officials said there would be additional
meetings to try to reach an accord. [ID:nLDE71E289]
 Debt issued by the euro zone's heavily indebted countries,
however, remained under pressure. Uncertainty over a rescue
package has seen spreads between peripheral nation bond yields
and German benchmarks widen in recent days.
 The euro zone ended last year with stable economic growth,
but disappointed those hoping for a faster recovery as
expansion in the three largest nations fell short of forecasts,
and Greece and Portugal contracted. But German data and a
sentiment indicator suggested the country's economic recovery
remained on track.
 Data overnight showed Chinese inflation came in lower than
expected at 4.9 percent in the year to January, but price
pressures excluding food were their strongest in at least a
decade and could force the central bank to keep tightening
monetary policy. [ID:nTOE71E01Y]
 Inflationary pressures, particularly in emerging markets,
have been part of the motivation this year for investors to
move into developed stock markets.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> stock index logged a 10-month
closing high, ending up 0.2 percent. European shares <.FTEU3>
hit a fresh 29-month closing high, as Barclays Plc  led

 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The dollar rallied to its
highest level against the yen in eight weeks on Tuesday,
prompted by an early rise in U.S. Treasury yields, with more
gains expected if bond markets continue to factor in U.S.-Japan
interest rate differentials.
The dollar has gained against the yen in nine of the past 10
sessions. At the same time, it is trading near the top of its
upper bollinger band, a widely used technical indicator that
could signal the rally is running out of steam.

 Higher Treasury yields have increased the appeal of the
dollar versus the yen recently, with the greenback up roughly 2
percent over the last two weeks. In early afternoon New York
trading it was up 0.6 percent to 83.76 yen.
 David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital

 * Tax revenue seen decreasing
 * New spending to be taken from other parts of budget
 
 By Patrick Werr
 CAIRO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The political unrest that rocked
Egypt over the last month will cut tax revenue and has prompted
the government to raise the 2010/11 budget deficit forecast by
as much as half a percentage point of gross domestic product,
its finance minister said on Tuesday.
 The impact could be greater in the next fiscal year if the
political and economic uncertainty continues, Egypt's new
finance minister Samir Radwan told Reuters in a telephone
interview.
 Total government spending in the current year ending in
June, however, will be unchanged from the original target as a
series of promised increases in spending will be balanced by
taking funds from other parts of the budget, he said.
 Egypt had predicted a deficit of 7.9 percent of GDP for
fiscal 2010/11 before the unrest that ousted President Hosni
Mubarak last week, but has now revised that up to 8.2 to 8.4
percent of GDP, Radwan said.
 ""This is mainly because of a slowdown in economic activity,""
he said, adding that the figures were preliminary.
 Egypt posted a deficit of 8.3 percent of GDP in 2009/10.
 The unrest will slow tax revenue growth this year, but the
main hit will come in the 2011/12 fiscal year if political and
economic conditions remain uncertain, Radwan said.
 ""It is next fiscal year. That is when we expect a decline in
tax revenue if the situation continues,"" Radwan said.
 Two of the Egyptian government's other main sources of
revenue, tolls from the Suez Canal and energy sales, have
continued to hold up well, he said.
 He said rather than demand a lump sum from companies on
April 1 as normal, the government will now allow companies to
pay income tax in three instalments by the end of June.
 Economists say a decline in tourism, consumption and
business activity since the unrest broke out has harmed taxes,
which make up about 60 percent of total government revenue. They
estimate that revenue from corporate income tax may actually
fall this year.
 Mohamed Rahmy, an economist with Beltone Financial, said he
expected that revenue growth in 2010/11 could slow to 5 percent
from a previous forecast of 15 percent.
 ""Once things stabilise -- and there have been promising
signs -- you won't have such a steep slowdown,"" Rahmy said.
 Radwan said the government would pay for additional spending
it has announced since the unrest broke out by taking funds from
other parts of the budget.
 ""It will be rearranging lines, juggling lines, etc.,"" Radwan
said. ""Nothing we have decided has affected the budget deficit.""
 The government has brought forward by three months a bonus
it gives each year to civil servants, equal this year to 15
percent of their salaries, Radwan said.
 There will be no increase in civil servants' salaries apart
from the annual increases announced every year in the new budget
that takes effect on July 1, he said. 
 Radwan said a 5 billion pound fund announced last week to
compensate people who suffered losses during the unrest was
counterbalanced by decreased interest payments on loans that the
government had budgeted for when it drew up its budget last
year.
 Only about 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds of a 2.8 billion
pound fund to ensure food imports represented additional
funding, with the rest having been already allocated for
previously, he said.

 * Trade reform would boost competitiveness

(Adds Brazilian comment at end)
 GENEVA, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Japan must liberalise its foreign
trade as part of wide-ranging structural reforms to restore
competitiveness and boost growth, the World Trade Organization
said on Tuesday.
 Looser macro-economic policies, albeit offset by the
appreciation of the yen that reinforces deflationary pressures
and saps export competitiveness, have helped Japan's economy
recover from the global financial crisis, the WTO said.
 But these policies do not address long-standing structural
problems, including a rapidly aging population, reflected in
sluggish growth for a decade in real gross domestic product and
productivity, it said in a report prepared for a regular review
of Japan's trade policies.
 ""These problems can be addressed more effectively by
far-reaching structural reforms, of which trade liberalisation
(and the resulting stimulus to competition) is an integral
part,"" the WTO said. ""However, structural reforms have, if
anything, slowed since 2009.""
 The report was prepared in early January and so does not
reflect some recent reform initiatives by Prime Minister Naoto
Kan.
 The report notes that the government has been moving towards
income support in agriculture -- where productivity is lower
than in the rest of the economy -- from price support.
 But agriculture continues to benefit from substantial
government support including higher tariffs than on other
sectors, quotas, income support and in some sectors production
controls, it said.
 In its own report for the review, the Japanese government
noted that Japan was the world's biggest net importer of food
and was particularly keen to strengthen international trade
rules on export prohibitions and restrictions.
 Brazil, a major food exporter, expressed concern at the high
level of trade barriers and subsidies distorting trade in
agricultural goods with Japan.
 Brazilian trade official Estanislau Amaral also told the
review that Brazil wanted more information about Japanese
government support for civil aircraft as it could break WTO

 * Oil higher on supply worries, Mideast protests

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - World stocks edged off recent
30-month highs on Tuesday after weaker-than-expected U.S.
retail sales tempered optimism about the American economy and
oil prices rose as protests in Middle East countries raised
concerns about potential supply disruptions.
 The MSCI world stocks index <.MIWD00000PUS> dropped 0.1
percent, though the index remained near last week's 30-month
highs.
 U.S. stocks <.DJI> <.SPX> fell after data showed sales at
U.S. retailers rose only 0.3 percent in January as extreme
weather in large parts of the country kept shoppers at home.
Trading volume was lower than average, following the lightest
day of trading in U.S. markets this year.
 ""I don't know if today's data was soft enough to take the
legs from underneath the market, but interestingly it's
indicative of some spending exhaustion occurring in the
consumer space,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
 Brent crude for April delivery  earlier pushed to
$104.04 a barrel, before retreating. U.S. crude oil for March
delivery  climbed as high as $85.97 in early New York
trading, rebounding from a 2-1/2-month low set in the previous
session.
 Last week's ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
the toppling of Tunisian counterpart Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali a
month earlier have raised concern among investors that Middle
East political protests could disrupt oil supplies.
 ""We are seeing contagion from Tunisia and Egypt in other
countries that are more important for the oil markets,"" said
Christophe Barret, oil analyst at Credit Agricole Corporate and
Investment Bank.
 Stocks worldwide earlier Tuesday got a boost after Chinese
inflation data came in lower than expected at 4.9 percent in
the year to January, easing investor concerns the world's No. 2
economy will have to tighten monetary policy more aggressively.
[ID:nTOE71E01Y]
 ""The data probably slightly eased expectations of immediate
tightening, although in the overall scheme of things, this
doesn't change the fact that China is still in a tightening
phase,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief economist at SMBC.
 Inflation pressures, particularly in emerging markets, have
been part of the motivation this year for investors to move
into developed stock markets.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> stock index logged a 10-month
closing high and Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.1
percent.
 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 The U.S. dollar climbed as high as 83.93 yen  on
trading platform EBS, the highest level since mid-December,
boosted by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
 Two-year notes  yields earlier reached around
0.89 percent, their highest level since May of last year.
 But the dollar slipped versus the euro , which was
boosted by demand from Middle East and Asian investors.
 Europe moved closer to a deal on tackling its debt crisis
on Tuesday. But time is tight to agree a comprehensive package
by the end of March. Officials announced extra meetings to try
to reach an accord.
 Debt issued by the euro zone's heavily indebted countries
remained under pressure. Uncertainty over a rescue package for
the region has seen spreads between peripheral bond yields and
German benchmarks widen in recent days.
 The euro zone ended last year with stable economic growth,
disappointing those hoping for a faster recovery as expansion
in the three largest nations fell short of forecasts and Greece
and Portugal contracted. But German data and a sentiment
indicator suggested the country's economic recovery remained on
track.

 * Heckler brings strains to fore, interrupts lecture
 
 By Mohammed Abbas
 LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - A Russian dissident living in
Britain interrupted a lecture by Russia's visiting foreign
minister on Tuesday, calling for the release of a jailed tycoon
and drawing attention to Moscow's patchy democracy record.
 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was speaking at the London
School of Economics when dissident Andrei Sidelnikov shouted
about the murder of a Kremlin critic in London five years ago.
 Russia refuses to extradite Andrei Lugovoy, whom Britain
wants to prosecute for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a
former Russian state security officer who died in London in 2006
from poisoning by radioactive polonium-210.
 ""We would like to send gifts to different Russian people in
politics. We would like to send English tea .... without
polonium-210 to Mr. Lugovoy,"" shouted Sidelnikov. ""Lugovoy"" is
also Russian for a type of herbal tea.
 An agitated Lavrov jabbed his finger at Sidelnikov, saying
he would ""guarantee"" the gifts would reach their destination.
 During their brief exchange, interrupted by laughter from
the audience, Sidelnikov also called for the release of Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, a former tycoon convicted of theft and money
laundering in a Moscow trial many see as politically motivated.
 He added he wanted to send a copy of the constitution to
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, saying he wanted to remind him of
its contents.
 Britain has angered Russia by giving political asylum to
prominent Kremlin foes. Sidelnikov is himself a well known
dissident, who met Litvinenko shortly before he died.
 The incident soured a rare visit to Britain by a Russian
foreign minister, intended to cement a gradual improvement in
relations between the countries after the Litvinenko affair.
 Lavrov held talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron
and Foreign Secretary William Hague, paving the way for a
planned visit by Cameron to Russia later this year.
 In a symbolic move, they agreed to update the Cold War-era
telephone hotline between Cameron's 10 Downing St. office and
the Kremlin, and to look at ways of cooperating in fighting
organised crime and countering radicalisation.
 Hague raised the issue of Lugovoy with Lavrov, and a
spokesman for Cameron said it was one of the barriers to greater
cooperation on security between the two countries.
 In December, Britain and Russia engaged in tit-for-tat
diplomatic expulsions reminiscent of Cold War spy rows. 
 Economic ties are more vibrant. Last month, Britain's BP
and Russia's state-controlled Rosneft announced a share swap
and Arctic exploration deal, underlining the strength of
business ties.

 * Food inflation to spark investment in infrastructure, R&D
 * GM crops have role to play to meet growing demand for food
By Nigel Hunt
BIRMINGHAM, England, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Government efforts
to control prices, now that food inflation has risen to the top
of political agendas across the globe, may hamper a needed
increase in supplies, a Cargill director warned on Tuesday.
 Paul Conway, senior vice president and board member with the
U.S. agribusiness and trading giant, said it was clear that
political instability in the Middle East was linked to food
inflation and that the issue was set to be at the top of the G20
agenda.
 ""The good news is we believe we will see increased
investment in infrastructure. We will see increased R and D
(research and development) investment to improve yields, a
second green revolution if you like,"" he said.
 He was wary, however, of any attempts by governments to hold
down prices to help the urban poor, noting their needs were
often given priority over those of rural farm communities.
 ""Usually the urban poor trump the rural farm community
because they have this tendency to riot. Governments worldwide
tend to fix prices so the signals the marketplace needs simply
do not get through to farmers,"" he said.
 Conway said he was encouraged that Russia was one of only a
few governments to impose an export ban during the current surge
in food prices, in contrast to the 2007/08 crisis.
 ""In 2008 there were many governments around the world that
did that. There is a realization that that type of action in the
short term may help your domestic audience, (but) in the longer
term it is counterproductive,"" he said.
 
 COCOA TAX
 Conway also cited actions taken in top cocoa grower Ivory
Coast as an example of government action that has hindered the
expansion of domestic production.
 ""In Ivory Coast, which is undergoing a lot of turmoil at the
moment, the government has consistently taxed the export of that
product to a level that farmers get no incentive to look after
their crop,"" he said.
 He said it was left to companies such as Cargill to work
with local producers to improve productivity, yield and quality
of the product.
 Conway said the rise in prices was largely supply-driven,
with demand only modestly higher.
 ""When we sat down as a company in April 2010 and surveyed
the world of commodities we were extremely bearish.
 ""What happened over the next six months was first of all in
Australia, then in Russia and Ukraine, and then in Germany and
France and then in the United States, we saw 80 million tonnes
of grain knocked off our estimates.""
 Conway said he believed genetically modified crops could
help meet an expected 40 percent rise in demand for food over
the next 20 years.
 ""We do not produce GM product, but we think they are one of
the tools in the toolbox ... particularly in a water-stretched
environment to help provide that additional food for the world,""
he said.

 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Germany's economy will grow more
slowly than hoped in 2011 and the pace of inflation in the euro
zone offers no justification for the European Central Bank to
raise interest rates this year, a top economic advisor said.
 Peter Bofinger, one of the five ""wise men"" who formally
advise the German government, said benign core inflation and
austerity programmes already weighing on several European
economies mean the ECB should stick to its expansionary policy.
 ""It's neurotic to be scared about inflation at this point,""
Bofinger told Reuters.
 ""This is one of the most ambitious fiscal consolidations in
the history of Europe that we will be facing this year. So it's
good if monetary policy follows a more expansionary stance to
allow (this) without falling back into recession.""
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For a Reuters Insider Interview with German government
advisor Peter Bofinger, click on:

 Euro zone inflation held at 2.4 percent year on year for the
second month running in January, and ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet said at the bank's February policy meeting it is likely
to climb further and could exceed the ECB's target of close to 2
percent for most of the year.
 But Trichet also said it poses no threat yet to price
stability, comments that, along with renewed concerns about debt
on the euro zone periphery, have caused investors to scale back
expectations of when the ECB will raise rates. [ID:nLDE7120I5]
 Bofinger said that, in the euro zone, inflation was being
driven at the moment mostly by one-off effects such as increases
in value-added tax and bad weather contributing to a rise in
food prices.
 ""One should pay more attention to the core inflation rate in
the euro area which is around one percent, which is definitely
no reason for increasing interest rates,"" he said.
 
 NO GERMAN OVERHEATING
 In Germany, some economists fear, demands for wage hikes in
the light of the country's robust economic recovery will lead to
a wage-price spiral.
 Volkswagen  and German unions agreed to a
substantial wage hike of 3.2 percent last week, which raises the
prospect of other sectors gaining similar inflation-busting
increases this year. [ID:nLDE717176]
 But Bofinger noted this came after years of wage restraint,
and said German inflation would not rise above 2 percent in the
medium term.
 ""We are going to have a situation where real wages increase
in line with productivity,"" he said. ""That does not mean
inflation, instead it means we will no longer have the
deflationary effect from wages which we had for many years in
the last decade.""
 Bofinger said he definitely saw no risk of Europe's largest
economy overheating, with most recent economic data only
modestly positive and retail sales even declining.
 ""We will definitely have a deceleration in the economic
recovery this year, and it will likely be stronger than
expected,"" he said, after data showed German investor sentiment
and fourth quarter growth coming in lower than expected.

 GREECE NEEDS MORE HELP
 On the topic of the euro zone debt crisis, Bofinger said
Greece would not be able to manage without a comprehensive
package of measures for the euro zone, which included reducing
troubled countries' debt burdens and offering them favourable
financing.
 The European Union is working to overhaul its budget rules,
improve economic policy coordination, strengthen its existing
rescue fund and create a new, permanent crisis resolution
mechanism.
 Finance ministers will agree on Tuesday to some ideas
contained in a Franco-German pact for the euro zone, a draft
statement showed, a move that may help seal a late-March deal on
tackling the year-long crisis. [ID:nLDE71E158]
 On the decision of Bundesbank head Axel Weber not to stand
for ECB president, Bofinger said this was not a problem.
 ""Since the start of the ECB there has been no German ECB
president; nevertheless the ECB has managed to keep its
inflation rate admirably close to its inflation target,"" he
said.
 ""Obviously, you do not need a German central bank president
in order to generate stable and low inflation rates in the euro
area.""

180,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2011 11:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Camera material germanium dioxide hits 2-yr high," * China wants to sell finished goods, not raw materials
 * China building up military, needs germanium 
 
 (Adds background, details, comment from traders from para 3)
 By Pratima Desai
 LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Spot prices of germanium dioxide
jumped to their highest levels in Europe in more than two years
this month as supplies of the material from China fell short of
demand, traders said.
 Germanium dioxide, used in speciality glass for wide-angle
camera lenses, has jumped to around $950 a kg, the highest since
early November 2008. Later that same month, prices plummeted as
consumers feared the financial crisis would lead to a drop-off
in demand and slashed their stocks.
 Current levels compare with around $900 a kg last month and
$570 a kg in September last year.
 ""We have become very dependent on China for raw materials;
this year we will pay the price. Rather than sell germanium
dioxide, which now has a 5 percent penalty tax if exported,
China wants to sell the lens,"" a germanium trader said.
""Germanium is typical of the Chinese attitude today. China
Inc has shifted from a supplier of raw materials to a vendor of
value-added finished goods ... People are a lot more relaxed
about demand; they know the market needs the material.""
 Germanium metal, used to make optical fibres for infrared
devices and lenses for military equipment and as a semiconductor
in electronic devices, is up at around $1,300 a kg from levels
near $1,175 in late December last year.
 Germanium plant closures in August and September last year,
partly because of attempts to cut environmental pollution, have
also left the market short of material, traders said.
 ""The Chinese government said last year it will buy germanium
for its domestic stockpile, and the U.S. has basically
liquidated its stockpile,"" another trader said.
 ""China is embarking on a huge build-up of its military. This
is forcing other Asian countries also to build up their military
... The result is more demand for germanium.""
 The U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and a reduced need for
investment in military equipment in the world's largest economy,
however, could offset some demand growth from Asia, he added.

 * Military leaders' options curtailed by economic crisis
 
 By Tom Pfeiffer
 CAIRO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The Egyptian army, praised for
overseeing a mostly peaceful revolution, is running into a storm
of wage and subsidy demands overtaking pressure for democracy
and piling more burdens on an already teetering economy.
 That has already happened in Tunisia, where strikes and
protests continue more than a month after citizens ousted their
strongman president and galvanised Egypt's opposition forces to
do the same with theirs last week.
 Violence has flared anew in Tunisia, raising new questions
about its stability and leading the government to ask military
reservists to report for duty as police skipped work.
 In Egypt, pro-democracy marches have subsided for now but
thousands of workers in banks, textile and food factories, oil
facilities and government offices went on strike this week,
emboldened by the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak.
 ""One thing that led to unrest in Tunisia is that workers can
now express themselves and make demands they couldn't make under
the previous government, and that may be manifesting itself in
Egypt too,"" said North Africa political risk consultant Geoff
Porter. ""I think Egypt is in for a very tough economic future.""
 Egypt's financial market remains shut and the tourism
industry -- a vital source of hard currency -- faces crisis.
 The military called on Monday for national solidarity and
criticised the strikes.
 Risks for Egypt look, if anything, greater than in Tunisia.
 Its much larger population is poorer and tourism accounts
for a bigger chunk of Egypt's economy -- more than 11 percent of
its GDP, making it one of the top sources of foreign revenue.
 In the major seaside tourist destinations of Sharm el-Sheikh
and Hurghada, hotel occupancy rates plummeted to 11 percent on
Feb. 11, the day of Mubarak's fall, from 75 percent on Jan. 25,
according to an industry body. It was not aware of layoffs yet.
 Two thirds of the population is under 30, an age group that
accounts for 90 percent of Egypt's jobless. Officially, around
10 percent of Egyptians are jobless but analysts say the figure
is probably much higher when factoring in the under-employed.
 Economists say that is partly due to systematic corruption
which distorts competition and discourages investment.
 Food inflation was already running high before the protests
and anecdotal evidence suggests it has soared further, weakening
an already brittle social balance.
 ""The issues in Egypt are all the greater given the stresses
in the economy, particularly food price inflation which is
unsustainably high,"" said Angus Blair, head of research at
investment bank Beltone. Credit Agricole estimated that the
crisis was costing the Egyptian economy $310 million every day.
 
 WAGE DEMANDS
 Prices of food and drinks, accounting for 44 percent of the
basket used to measure inflation, accelerated year-on-year to 18
percent in January, up from 17.2 percent in December. That was
before the crisis. Egyptians say prices have risen since then.
 The new cabinet has already promised to maintain subsidies
and raise some state wages and pensions by 15 percent.
 The army might seek to quell labour unrest with more wage
hikes and subsidies, cutting funds available for social services
and infrastructure projects, analysts said.
 Economic liberalisation measures could take a back seat,
because these steps could threaten state jobs and damage popular
support for the military and its own business interests.
 That might buy time but will add stress on state finances
facing a sharp drop in tax revenue and costlier borrowing.
 ""There is this jubilation and exuberance of Egyptians but
the reality is there are more uncertainties than before,"" said
John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi.
 He said the government may be waiting for political tension
to ease before reopening Egypt's bourse because ""if they settle
the situation they could save the market from sinking further"".
 Trading on the Egyptian Exchange was halted after the market
lost 69 billion Egyptian pounds ($11.74 billion) of its value
over two days. The reopening has been delayed several times.
 
 DEFICIT WARNING
 Some investors are still upbeat, given the absence of mass
protests after the army dissolved parliament and suspended the
constitution, saying it would govern the country for six months
or until new elections were held.
 But growth will suffer. The government says it could fall to
3.5 or 4 percent in 2010/11, down from a previously forecast 6
percent. J.P. Morgan slashed its 2010/11 growth forecast to 3.1
percent from 6.4 percent after the protests exploded.
 ""We will probably change it again this week and it will be
biased to the upside because of the fact the situation has
become more or less stable,"" said Brahim Razgallah, J.P.
Morgan's Middle East and North Africa economist. ""The impact on
the economy in Egypt is still not very clear but ... they
avoided the worst case scenario and a large hit to sentiment.""
 Analysts are watching whether strikers heed the army's plea
to go back to work on Wednesday after a national holiday.
 If workers do not and it considers concessions on wages and
subsidies, that could further depress Egyptian assets.
 Egypt's state debt was already beyond safe levels at 89.5
percent of gross domestic product in mid-2010, the head of the
Central Auditing Agency Gawdat el-Malt said this week.
 ""The budget deficit is going to balloon, whether they like
it or not,"" said Sfakianakis.

 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The euro outperformed the
dollar for the first time in four days on Tuesday, bouncing
from a three-week low as investors' appetite for risk improved,
but gains could be fleeting as technical factors point to
losses.
 The euro rose above the pivotal level of $1.35 and traded
off a 3-week low of $1.3428 in the overnight session, with
options expirations noted at $1.3500. The euro faces obstacles
from several directions, however, with sovereign debt risk and
interest rate differentials working decidedly against the
single currency.
 In early New York trading the euro was up 0.3 percent
against the dollar at $1.3522 after breaking its 100-day moving
average at $1.3541.
 Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital
in Toronto, said near-term technicals are warning of the
potential of further downside for the euro and suggest that a
test down to $1.3425 is likely.
 The dollar trimmed gains against the yen but remained at an
8-week high after data showed U.S. retail sales rose less than
expected in January.
 Higher Treasury yields have increased the appeal of the

strategist at BNP Paribas. ""There are concerns about the
banking system, and yield differentials (between the euro zone

 Peripheral euro-zone yield spreads have been widening in
the past week on uncertainty over a rescue package for the
region, and there was little sign the recent unease had been
tempered by an agreement from European finance ministers on
Monday.
 Finance ministers agreed on Monday that a permanent rescue
mechanism be set up from 2013 would total 500 billion euros,
but there was no agreement over how to beef up its existing
rescue fund.
 The euro showed little reaction to German analyst and
investor sentiment rising slightly in February amid confidence
in Germany's economic recovery, according to a survey by the
ZEW economic think tank on Tuesday.
 Yield differentials were less favorable for the euro, with
two-year German bonds yielding 0.54 percentage points more than
U.S. Treasuries, the narrowest yield spread in nearly a month
and sharply below a two-year high of 0.82 percentage points hit
in January.
 Scotia Capital's Sutton said while bond yield spreads
between euro-zone periphery debt and Germany are still being
pressured higher, 2-year spreads appear to be topping out.
 ""This will be positive for the euro,"" she said. ""In the
medium term we expect the euro to retrace recent losses and
believe that by year-end the euro will have sustainably
retraced all of its late 2010 losses.""
 Sterling rallied 0.7 percent after data showed for the
thirteenth consecutive month the United Kingdom's inflation
rate is above the upper target of the Bank of England. This
fueled speculation that interest rates will rise in the near
term as the Bank of England seeks to contain price pressures.
 Wednesday's Bank of England's inflation report is expected
to be hawkish and revise up near-term inflation projections,
which could boost expectations that interest rates will rise
soon and help the pound retain broad gains made this year..

 * Dollar climbs to 8-week high versus yen
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose on
Tuesday as protests in Middle East countries raised concerns
about potential supply disruptions, while the U.S. dollar hit
an eight-week high versus the yen as Treasury yields advanced.
 World stocks were little changed, erasing early gains after
a report showed U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in
January. Wall Street stocks fell at the open.
 U.S. crude for March delivery  staged a rally as New
York woke up, climbing as high as $85.97, rebounding from a
2-1/2-month low set in the previous session.
 Last week's ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
the toppling of his Tunisian counterpart Zine al-Abidine Ben
Ali a month earlier have raised tensions among investors that
spreading unrest could disrupt oil supplies.
 ""We are seeing contagion from Tunisia and Egypt to other
countries that are more important for the oil markets,"" said
Christophe Barret, oil analyst at Credit Agricole Corporate and
Investment Bank.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were last
little changed on the day, holding near last week's 30-month
highs. Japan's Nikkei <.N225> logged a 10-month closing high
and Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up 0.1 percent.
 Stocks worldwide earlier got a boost after Chinese
inflation came in lower than expected at 4.9 percent in the
year to January, easing investor concerns that the world's No 2
economy will have to tighten monetary policy more aggressively.
[ID:nTOE71E01Y]
 ""The data probably slightly eased expectations of immediate
tightening, although in the overall scheme of things, this
doesn't change the fact that China is still in a tightening
phase,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief economist at SMBC.
 Inflation pressures, particularly in emerging markets, have
been part of the motivation this year for investors to move
into developed stock markets.
 DOLLAR AND YIELDS
 The dollar climbed as high as 83.93 on trading platform
EBS, the highest level since mid-December, boosted by a rise in
U.S. Treasury yields.
 Two-year notes  were last down 1/32 in price with
yields rising to 0.87 percent, up from 0.85 percent late
Monday. The note yields earlier tested technical support levels
with yields reaching 0.89 percent, their highest level since
May of last year.
 But the dollar fell versus the euro , which was
boosted by demand from Middle East and Asian investors.
Analysts cautioned that euro sentiment remained fragile given
scepticism over whether euro zone leaders would come up with a
quick and effective solution to tackle its debt crisis.
 Peripheral euro zone yield spreads have been widening in
the past week on uncertainty over a rescue package for the
region, and there was some disappointment after a meeting of
European finance ministers on Monday.
 ""Initial optimism at the beginning of the year over a
comprehensive bailout package in the euro zone is now starting
to fade away,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM
UFJ.
 Data showed that the euro zone economy ended last year with
stable growth, but it failed to meet expectations for an
acceleration as expansion in the three largest nations fell
short of forecasts and Greece and Portugal contracted.
 Countering this, German analyst and investor sentiment rose
slightly in February amid confidence in Germany's economic
recovery, a survey by the ZEW economic think tank showed.

 * EU withheld details of export plans shared with industry
 * Commission says needs to protect foreign relations

(Adds comment from European Commission)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Transparency campaigners sued
the European Union's executive on Tuesday for withholding
documents on trade talks with India, stepping up pressure on the
bloc to make its policymaking less secretive.
 The lawsuit, lodged with the EU's second-highest court,
accuses the EU Commission of breaking transparency and democracy
rules by refusing to disclose to campaigners details of plans
shared with EU industry on how to open Indian markets.
 ""Industry lobbies enjoy massively privileged access and
influence in trade negotiations, even when there are concerns
from other quarters that this is threatening Indian labour
rights and access to medicines,"" said Pia Eberhardt, campaigner
for Corporate Europe Observatory, which lodged the complaint.
 India is expected to complete a free trade deal with the EU
this year, but activists worry a pact could limit its production
of cheap, generic HIV and anti-malaria drugs.
 They are also worried that opening India's retail sector to
international supermarkets could put Indian vendors and small
shopkeepers out of business.
 The case, lodged with the European General Court, focuses
on the Commission's refusal over 18 months to give campaigners
full access to email exchanges and notes from meetings with EU
governments and business groups about how to export more pork,
poultry, medical equipment and car tyres to India.
 The Commission deleted key passages before giving the notes
to the Observatory, citing rules to protect international
relations, according to documents obtained by Reuters.
 ""If the Commission has already shared information with the
business world at large, the same information cannot suddenly
become confidential when a public interest group asks for it,""
Eberhardt said.
 The lawsuit says the Commission sent full notes to lobby
groups like BusinessEurope, the largest EU employers' grouping.
 ""The European Commission is committed to working as openly
and transparently as possible and we support the public's right
to know. It is clear that all negotiations require a degree of
confidentiality to ensure such a process can move forward,"" said
Commission spokesman John Clancy.
 The Commission regularly seeks input from industry and civil
society, he added. 
 BusinessEurope was not immediately available to comment.
 In a handwritten note included in the suit, former EU trade
chief Peter Mandelson invited BusinessEurope to share sensitive
information with India's main business group. The lawsuit argues
this voids claims of confidentiality.
 EU institutions are under increasing pressure to lift the
veil of secrecy shrouding much of their decision-making.
 More than 240 campaigners and journalists this month asked
the European Parliament to act against a Commission plan to
tighten laws on access to information.
 The Commission has cited the protection of international
relations in its refusal to reveal details of meetings between
EU officials and representatives of European pharmaceuticals
companies including Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline, the
Observatory said.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2011 09:04AM ET</span>",European unity the first victim of killer drones," * Batch of unmanned aircraft programmes competing in Europe
 * Divided Europe lags behind United States, Israel 
 * Drone developments could shape next generation of fighters
 
 By Cyril Altmeyer 
 PARIS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Europe needs to co-operate on
building unmanned military aircraft or risk falling behind in
the race to develop the next generation of jet fighters that may
not even be flown by pilots, industry experts have warned.
 Despite huge development costs, European nations compete to
sell three different types of fighter plane to preserve their
national pride and can ill afford to show disunity in the $100
billion market for drones, executives and analysts said.
 ""Nothing would be worse than having all the European
countries ... saying they need roughly similar systems but not
avoiding the traps they fell into regarding military aviation in
Europe,"" said Nicolas Chamussy, in charge of drones at EADS's
Cassidian defence unit.
 France pulled out of the Eurofighter combat jet in the early
1980s to focus on the all-French Dassault Rafale but has failed
so far to find an export market for it. 
 The four-nation Eurofighter is built by EADS on behalf of
Germany and Spain, along with Britain's BAE Systems and
Finmeccanica of Italy. Sweden's Saab offers the lightweight
Gripen fighter.
 All three European planes are competing against U.S. and
Russian arms firms in a $10 billion contest to supply India.
 Now, a similar pattern of shifting alliances is being played
out in the battle for control of unmanned technology. It is an
important market in its own right and could be a testbed for
technology to be used in future generations of fighters.
 In early 2009, EADS unveiled a next generation drone called
Talarion. But the European defence group is still awaiting a
green light from France, Spain and Germany, the three nations
who would share the cost estimated at nearly 3 billion euros.
 Dassault Aviation and BAE have proposed a military drone to
France and Britain under a new cross-Channel defence pact, but
without EADS.
 ""We are pragmatic: it is a European programme, but with two
partners,"" said Eric Trappier, Dassault Aviation's executive
vice-president in charge of international.
 
 $100 BILLION MARKET 
 There is also a debate over whether Europe should try to be
self-sufficient or rely on adapting Israeli platforms, such as in
the Thales-Dassault bid to build a medium altitude long
endurance (MALE) drone to compete with the EADS Talarion.
 Most of these players are meanwhile involved in developing a
pan-European stealth attack drone called the nEUROn, while BAE
Systems has rolled out a prototype of a pilotless military plane
called the Mantis, shaped like the predatory insect.
 Critics say such disunity and delays are making it harder
for Europe to catch up with U.S. manufacturers such as Northrop
Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Atomics and with
Israeli groups such as IAI.
 Global spending on unmanned aircraft is expected to total
about $103.5 billion from 2011 to 2020, according to data from
Virginia-based Teal Group. Over three quarters of this comes
from the United States and only 10 percent from Europe.
 As with many military ventures, shrinking defence budgets
could provide Europeans countries the impetus they need to
co-operate on research, Guillaume Rochar, aerospace and defence
leader at the Paris office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said.
 ""But those are state-of-the-art technologies and nobody
wants to show their cards,"" he added.
 France's Defence Minister Alain Juppe is expected to
announce his choice of drones by the end of the month and has
not excluded buying General Atomics' Predator off the shelf for
the country's most pressing needs in Afghanistan.
 The implications of such a choice could be far-reaching.
 ""If France bought Predators today, would this mean it would
not develop a combat drone? Rochard asked. ""And if France
decided not to invest in research and development in combat
drones, how could it maintain its know-how regarding fighting
jets?""

 * Local planning issues may stall expansion in food output
 * UK farm minister says EU's CAP budget is bound to shrink
 
 By Nigel Hunt
 BIRMINGHAM, England, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Britain needs a
national food plan that makes production a strategic priority
and curbs its increasing reliance on imports, Peter Kendall,
president of the National Farmers Union said on Tuesday.
 Kendall told the NFU's annual conference that global food
prices were at an all-time high and had played a role in major
upheavals in North Africa.
 He questioned the morality of rich countries such as Britain
in allowing their own agriculture production to decline and
expecting to be fed by the rest of the world.
 ""If we continue like this - and with our own population set
to grow to over 70 million by 2030 - it won't be long before one
in every two meals eaten in this country comes entirely from
food produced abroad,"" he said.
 An increase in domestic food production will not happen
without local planning consent as well as free and functioning
domestic markets, Kendall said.
 ""A narrow localist agenda could put the brakes on the growth
we need -- state of the art polytunnels, critical to the success
of our soft fruit industry; high output glasshouses for veg; the
latest lower carbon, higher welfare pig, poultry and other
livestock units.
 ""That's why it's absolutely critical the government has food
production as one of its strategic priorities in the new
national planning framework,"" he added.
 Caroline Spelman, UK farming and environment minister, told
the conference that energy and water shortages were driving up
food prices.
 ""Here, many households are feeling the pinch. But in poor
countries we've seen the cost of bread can spark riots, "" she
said, adding world leaders must free up trade.
 
 CAP REFORMS
 She called for reforms to the European Union's Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) that help farmers become more
market-orientated and reward them for environmental benefits,
adding the European Commission's proposal ""lacks ambition"".
 The EU's executive adopted CAP reform plans in November
2010, which will form the basis of legislative proposals due by
mid-2011. An EU source has told Reuters they were drafted on the
assumption that the budget would remain stable.
 Spelman said a cut to the budget was, however, inevitable.
 ""Let's be realistic. There's bound to be a smaller CAP
budget, because it won't be the farming minister deciding this
but the finance ministers trying to balance the book,"" she said.
 NFU's Kendall said farmers would like to be less reliant on
public support but face challenges with markets that do not
work, whether because of unfair competition or because of the
imbalance of power in the supply chain.
 The NFU has been critical of the way large grocery retailers
have taken advantage of their strong bargaining positions with
suppliers, and the government has responded with plans for an
ombudsman to enforce a new code of practice.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The euro edged up versus the
dollar on Tuesday on demand from the Middle East and Asia, but
it remained vulnerable on scepticism over whether euro zone
leaders will agree a solution to the region's debt crisis.
 A jump in short-dated U.S. yields helped push the dollar to
an eight-week high against the yen as market players awaited
U.S. retail sales data and a New York manufacturing survey at
1330 GMT, which analysts said could boost the greenback.
 Negative sentiment towards the euro was reflected in its
falls against other currencies as it hit a decade low against
the Swedish crown  of 8.7290 crowns and a four-week
low versus sterling  of 83.84 pence.
 ""Overall the euro is very vulnerable and any rebound is
likely to be unsustainable,"" said Ian Stannard, currency
strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""There are concerns about the banking system, and yield
differentials (between the euro zone and the U.S.) are heading
lower, so all the ingredients are there for the euro to come
under more pressure"".
 Peripheral euro zone yield spreads have been widening in the
past week on uncertainty over a rescue package for the region,
and there was little sign the recent unease had been tempered by
an agreement from European finance ministers on Monday.
 The euro  was up 0.3 percent against the dollar at
$1.3520, having broken above its 100-day moving average at
$1.3541 to hit a session high of $1.3551.
 It held above a three-week low of $1.3428 hit on Monday when
reports that rescue plans for WestLB were under threat triggered
selling. [ID:nLDE71D1FT]
 Traders said Middle East demand had triggered stop-losses
through $1.3530 en route to the session highs, while Asian
accounts were reportedly looking to buy on dips back to the
$1.3450 region.
 The next support is the 55-day moving average at $1.3361, in
line with the 50 percent retracement of the euro's January to
February rally.
 Finance ministers agreed on Monday that a permanent rescue
mechanism to be set up from 2013 would total 500 billion euros,
but there was no agreement over how to beef up its existing
rescue fund. [ID:nLDE71D0JU]
 ""EU finmins have provided nothing more than a sweetener for
2013. They don't address the fact that Portugal faces huge
redemptions in April and may be forced into a bailout in the
next few months,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank in London.
 The euro showed little reaction to German analyst and
investor sentiment rising slightly in February amid confidence
in Germany's economic recovery, according to a survey by the ZEW
economic think tank on Tuesday. [ID:nLDE71E1HR]
 
 YIELD DIFFERENTIALS
 Yield differentials were less favourable for the euro, with
two-year German bonds yielding 0.54 percentage points more than
U.S. Treasuries -- the narrowest yield spread in nearly a month
and sharply below a two-year high of 0.82 percentage points hit
in January.
 The dollar also rose to an eight-week high against the yen
 of 83.76 yen, lifted as the two-year U.S. Treasury yield
 rose to 0.883 percent, its highest since May 2010.
 Traders think a strong reading in U.S. retail sales due at
1330 GMT could fuel a further rise in those yields, boosting the
dollar. Retail sales, which have been a bright spot in the
economy, are expected to show 0.6 percent growth in January from
the previous month.

 * Trade reform would boost competitiveness
 
 GENEVA, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Japan must liberalise its foreign
trade as part of wide-ranging structural reforms to restore
competitiveness and boost growth, the World Trade Organization
said on Tuesday.
 Looser macro-economic policies, albeit offset by the
appreciation of the yen that reinforces deflationary pressures
and saps export competitiveness, have helped Japan's economy
recover from the global financial crisis, the WTO said.
 But these policies do not address long-standing structural
problems, including rapid population aging, reflected in
sluggish growth for a decade in real gross domestic product and
productivity, it said in a report prepared for a regular review
of Japan's trade policies.
 ""These problems can be addressed more effectively by
far-reaching structural reforms, of which trade liberalisation
(and the resulting stimulus to competition) is an integral
part,"" the WTO said. ""However, structural reforms have, if
anything, slowed since 2009.""
 The report was prepared in early January and so does not
reflect some recent reform initiatives by Prime Minister Naoto
Kan.
 The report notes that the government has been moving towards
income support in agriculture -- where productivity is lower
than in the rest of the economy -- from price support.
 But agriculture continues to benefit from substantial
government support including higher tariffs than on other
sectors, quotas, income support and in some sectors production
controls, it said.
 In its own report for the review, the Japanese government
noted that Japan was the world's biggest net importer of food
and was particularly keen to strengthen international trade
rules on export prohibitions and restrictions.

 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Transparency campaigners have
hauled the European Union's executive to court for withholding
documents about free trade talks with India, intensifying
pressure on the bloc to make its policy-making less secretive.
 The lawsuit, lodged with the EU's second-highest court on
Tuesday, accuses the EU Commission of breaking transparency and
democracy rules by refusing to disclose to campaigners details
of plans shared with EU industry on how to open Indian markets.
 ""Industry lobbies enjoy massively privileged access and
influence in trade negotiations, even when there are concerns
from other quarters that this is threatening Indian labour
rights and access to medicines,"" said Pia Eberhardt, campaigner
for Corporate Europe Observatory, which lodged the complaint.
 Campaigners are focusing on India because the EU is expected
to complete a free trade agreement with the rapidly developing
nation this year following almost four years of negotiations.
 The case, lodged in the European General Court, concerns the
Commission's refusal over 18 months to give campaigners full
access to email exchanges and notes from meetings with EU
governments and business groups about how to export more pork,
poultry, medical equipment and car tyres to India.
 The Commission deleted key passages from the notes before
giving them to the Observatory, citing rules to protect
international relations, according to documents obtained by

 ""If the Commission has already shared information with the
business world at large, the same information cannot suddenly
become confidential when a public interest group asks for it,""
Eberhardt said.
 The claim says the Commission sent full notes to lobby
groups including BusinessEurope, the EU's largest employers'
organisation.
 In a handwritten note also submitted in the claim and seen
by Reuters, former EU trade chief Peter Mandelson invited
BusinessEurope to share sensitive information with India's
largest business group -- a move the challenge says voids
confidentiality claims.
 
 TRANSPARENCY PRESSURES
 EU institutions are under increasing pressure to lift the
veil of secrecy shrouding much of its decision-making.
 More than 240 campaigners and journalists this month asked
the European Parliament to act against a Commission plan to
tighten access to information laws, and civil rights groups have
sued twice over secrecy in the drafting of EU transparency law.
 Environmental groups took the Commission to court last year
for withholding details about the potentially harmful impact of
biofuels on the environment.
 An internal EU watchdog lambasted the executive for
withholding related letters by carmaker Porsche to a former EU
industry chief.
 EU-India trade negotiations have prompted protests in India,
the EU and Kenya amid concerns a pact will limit India's
production of cheap generic HIV and anti-malaria drugs, sold
widely across Africa and South America.
 They have also triggered fears that opening India's retail
sector to supermarket chains such as Carrefour, Tesco and Metro
will lead to unemployment among the country's vast ranks of
street vendors and small shopkeepers.
 The Commission has cited the protection of international
relations in its refusal to reveal details of meetings between
EU officials and representatives of European pharmaceuticals
companies including Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline, the

 BRUSSELS/BERLIN, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The euro zone economy
ended last year with stable growth, failing to meet expectations
for an acceleration as expansion in the three largest nations
fell short of forecasts and Greece and Portugal contracted.
 An expected pick-up in growth did not occur because
businesses ran down stocks in France, snow and cold hit

 But a separate survey suggested Germany at least should

 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said gross

by 0.4 percent and 2.1 percent respectively. A number now expect
a pick-up in the first quarter, albeit dampened by austerity
measures in many euro zone members.
 ""As we all know there was a cold snap in December, which
disrupted construction and trade activity, and the acceleration
in industrial activity was insufficient to offset this, so the
underlying picture looks more benign,"" said Martin van Vliet at
ING.
 German gross domestic product increased by 0.4 percent,
against expectations of a 0.5 percent rise and decelerating from
0.7 percent in the third quarter.
 Growth in the third quarter was already tempered after a
very strong April-June period -- when the German economy powered
ahead by 2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter.
 However, German analysts and investors remain convinced of
the health of Europe's largest economy, based on a small rise in
February's ZEW sentiment indicator.
 In France, the economy grew just 0.3 percent, half the
forecast increase and the same level as in the July-September
period, despite a rush to buy cars before a French scrappage
subsidy scheme ended last year.
 A strong negative factor was businesses running down stocks.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said she hoped for
stronger growth in the first quarter of 2011 and maintained the
government's forecast for expansion this year of 2 percent.
 Italian growth was also lower than expected, at just 0.1
percent, while the Dutch surprised on the upside.
 The euro slipped against the dollar after the release of the
French and German data, although it then recovered to hold above
Monday's three-week low.
 Snow and icy weather certainly played a role in the figures
for the final quarter, giving some hope for a stronger start to
2011. Construction in particular was hit hard and can be
expected to rebound.
 Nick Kounis, economist at ABN AMRO in Amsterdam, said the
weather may have cut 0.3 percentage points off German growth,
but this would also have boosted output in the energy sector.
 ""We are probably in a moderate recovery scenario which will
gather pace through the year as labour markets get better,"" he
said. ""It's not going to be incredibly buoyant.""
 
 TWIN-SPEED
 Data from across the euro zone pointed again to a twin-speed
Europe -- with a broadly healthy core of northern European
countries continuing to expand, while debt-burdened periphery
nations struggle.
 Data on Monday showed Portugal's economy shrank 0.3 percent
in the last quarter of 2010, reversing a third-quarter
expansion..
 The risk premium investors demand to hold Portuguese
government debt against equivalent German bunds has risen back
above 400 basis points since the start of the month, a sign that
it is viewed as next in line for an EU bailout after Greece and
Ireland.
 Greece's recession continued, with contraction of 1.4
percent from the previous quarter, against expectations of a 1.2
percent decline. The central bank said the economy would shrink
for a third straight year in 2011 with gross domestic product
dropping at least 3 percent.
 Spain, which markets appear to view as under less of a
threat in debt terms, grew by 0.2 percent in Q4 after stagnating
in the previous three months.
 ""The real problem is the divergence across the economies,
with the strength mainly coming from core Europe, with Germany
leading ... In countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal you don't
see a turnaround and domestic demand continues to be weak,"" said
Luigi Speranza, economist at BNP Paribas.
 Outside the euro zone, Sweden's central bank raised interest
rates for a fifth time in the light of strong growth there of
nearly seven percent year-on-year in the third quarter.
 In contrast, Britain's economy shrank in the last months of
the year, prompting warnings of a grim 2011 as the government
embarks on the deepest spending cuts in a generation.
 Inflation, rising to double the Bank of England's target in
January, highlights the country's dual problems of stagnation
and spiraling prices.

 By Patrick Lannin and Johan Ahlander
 STOCKHOLM, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank raised
its key repo rate by a quarter point on Tuesday and forecast
slightly faster hikes ahead to keep inflation within target and
brake a potentially dangerous build up in household debt.
 Sweden's economy, recovering from a 2009 recession which was
its worst downturn since World War Two, is now one of the
fastest growing in Europe and the central bank has raised rates
at five meetings in a row.
 But the forecast for a slightly faster pace of monetary
tightening was less aggressive than expected by investors and
the Swedish crown eased off its highs. The currency has soared
against the euro due to the strong economic growth and the fact
European Central Bank rates held at a record low 1.0 percent.
 ""The assessment is also that the repo rate needs to be
raised somewhat faster in the coming period,"" the bank said
after raising the repo rate to 1.50 percent from 1.25 in a
widely expected decision.
 ""To stabilise inflation close to the target of 2 percent and
to avoid resource utilisation being too high, the repo rate
needs to gradually increase,"" the Riksbank said in a statement.
 It said it also wanted to head off a housing bubble.
 ""Household debts have increased substantially in recent
years. If these debts continue to increase at a much faster rate
than incomes over a long period of time, there is a risk that
imbalances will build up in the Swedish economy,"" it said.
 ""A gradually increasing repo rate may help to slow down the
growth of household borrowing,"" it added.
 Economists said the forward-looking comments were a bit
milder than expected.
 ""As expected they hiked of course, and they are also raising
the path, but they are doing it a bit more cautiously than
expected,"" said SEB analyst Elisabet Kopelman.
 ""It is a pretty soft path,"" she said.

 STRONG GROWTH
 Others said the central bank might eventually have to soften
its stance.
 Data released at the same time as the rate decision on
capacity utilisation in industry showed a rise of just 0.2
percentage points in the fourth quarter, the slowest quarterly
rise in a year and a half.
 ""I still think they are too hawkish, that they may have to
retreat from that later this year,"" said RBS analyst Par
Magnusson, citing the rise of the crown and the fact that
mortgage rates have already risen more than the repo rate.
 The Swedish crown initially rose after the central bank rate
decision to 8.7350 to the euro, but by 0910 GMT it had eased
back to be flat at 8.7595.
 The bank kept its forecasts for Swedish growth this year at
4.4 percent after an expected 5.5 percent in 2010, which it said
was a higher pace than economies in the euro zone.
 All 18 analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast the
quarter-point hike and all but three expected another rate rise
at the bank's next meeting in April.
 As at earlier meetings, two of the six central bank's
governors disagreed with the decision to raise the repo rate and
wanted a slower path for rate rises.
 Sweden's rapidly recovering economy grew 6.9 percent
year-on-year in the third quarter of 2010 and its inflation rate
hit 2.3 percent in December.

 * Pressure grows for euro zone debt deal by end-March
 * Electoral timetable means Finland needs earlier decision

(Adds details on Finland's election schedule)
 BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Finland will host a meeting of
14 European Union leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel and
France's Nicolas Sarkozy, in Helsinki on March 4 to help prepare
a comprehensive response to the euro zone debt crisis.
 The gathering is the latest in a growing diary of meetings
between now and a full European Union summit on March 24/25, and
suggests leaders are scrambling to convince financial markets
that they can produce a package of measures to resolve the
year-long debt crisis.
 ""I will host in Helsinki a special meeting of EPP prime
ministers, which will focus on the preparation of the crucial
euro zone summit of March 11,"" Finland's deputy prime minister
and finance minister, Jyrki Katainen, said in a statement.
 The 14 leaders are from Katainen's centre-right European
People's Party, which is the largest and most influential
European-level political party and is the largest group in the
European Parliament.
 The March 11 gathering in Brussels is supposed to pave the
way for an agreement on March 24/25 on a package which should
include changes to the euro zone's current rescue fund, agreeing
on the details of a new rescue facility from 2013, and a package
of reforms to boost euro zone competitiveness.
 The March 11 summit will be followed by a meeting of euro
zone finance ministers on March 14 and maybe another euro zone
finance ministers' gathering on March 21.
 Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Monday that a
permanent rescue mechanism to be set up from 2013 would total
500 billion euros, but are waiting for EU leaders' guidance to
agree changes to the existing bailout fund. [ID:nLDE71D0JU]
 ""No one's going to take great comfort from that because it
doesn't address thing like the restructuring or the buybacks
that will ultimately lead to a restructuring of Greek and Irish
debt,"" said Charles Diebel, head of market strategy at Lloyds.
 ""It's almost like they felt they had to say something --
they're trying to show the world that they're still making
progress.""
 Markets hammered Portuguese bonds last week due to concerns
that Lisbon may need a bailout like Greece and Ireland. Its
10-year bond yields rose as high as 7.6 percent, a euro lifetime
high and well above the 7 percent level which the country's
finance minister has described as unsustainable.
 
 FINNISH DEADLINE
 Helsinki's backing is needed to sign off on the package of
measures since any decision taken by the euro zone on the issue
must be unanimous. 
 But Finland must also dissolve its parliament on March 15
ahead of an election on April 17, meaning the last opportunity
the current government has to give its approval to the
comprehensive package is March 11.
 ""Effectively, the deal has to be agreed on March 11 and then
finalised with no changes on March 24/25, otherwise it is very
difficult for Finland,"" a Finnish official said.
 Germany, whose support as Europe's largest economy is
essential to any deal, is reluctant to back an increase in the
existing bailout fund unless other euro zone member states sign
up to measures to cut spending and make their economies more
competitive.
 The EU and euro zone have been trying to get on top of the
debt crisis for more than a year. The end of March has emerged
as an unofficial deadline for resolving it.
 Failure to strike a deal then would probably inflame
financial markets again, analysts say.

 MILAN, Feb 15 (Reuters) - A successor to Jean-Claude Trichet
as head of the European Central Bank (ECB) needs to be decided
on quickly to avoid instability, Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden said in newspaper comments on Tuesday.
 He told Italy's La Stampa daily that Bundesbank President
Axel Weber had been a good candidate to be ECB president before
he dropped out last week. Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi
was impressive and intelligent, he said in an interview.
 ""There is a need to decide as soon as possible. Trichet
leaves in October. A delay risks generating instability,""
Frieden said.
 Draghi's time with U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs Group
Inc  is not a problem and having worked in the private
sector can be a big advantage, he said.
 Draghi has a chance of becoming ECB president if he is a
candidate, Frieden said.
 ""I have known Draghi for some time. I have always found him
impressive and intelligent ... Don't ask me, however, now, if I
will vote for him. First I have to evaluate the other names as
well,"" he said.
 European Union leaders are expected to select a new ECB
president around the middle of the year. Draghi is among
front-runners for the job. [ID:nLDE7181F1]
 In the interview, Frieden made no comments on Luxembourg's
central bank governor Yves Mersch and whether his government
would propose him for the ECB. Mersch has been speculated about
as one of the candidates to take over from Trichet.
 In the newspaper interview, Frieden also said that work on
new euro zone fiscal governance rules was going too slowly. Once
there is political consensus the details can be completed by
experts in two or three days, he said.
 Meanwhile, a German newspaper reported on Tuesday that
France would support the selection of a German candidate to
succeed Trichet.
 ""A German at the head of the ECB would send a strong signal
to financial markets that the Bundesbank's rescue efforts for
the euro would be brought along,"" business daily Handelsblatt
quoted an unnamed person familiar with the situation as saying.
 France would continue to follow this line of thinking, the
person told the paper, and did not support a candidate for the
job from a small EU country or Italy, it added.
 Paris feels Draghi's time spent working at Goldman Sachs is
politically detrimental, the paper reported.

 PARIS/BERLIN, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The French, German and
Italian economies expanded less than expected in the fourth
quarter, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting the euro zone may
not have accelerated out of a third-quarter slowdown.
 Economists have forecast the euro zone economy as a whole
grew by 0.4 percent in the final three months of 2010, after 0.3
percent in the third quarter and 1.0 percent in the second. But
that prediction now faces a clear downside risk.
 The data is due at 1000 GMT.
 The French, German and Italian economies make up about 65
percent of the single currency bloc.
 German gross domestic product increased by 0.4 percent,
against expectations of a 0.5 rise, decelerating from the 0.7
percent growth registered in the third quarter.
 In France, the expansion was 0.3 percent, half the expected
increase and the same level as in the July-September period,
despite a rush to buy cars before a French scrappage subsidy
scheme ended last year..
 Economists had been expecting growth in the euro zone's
second largest economy to rebound to the 0.6 percent it achieved
in the second quarter.
 A strong negative came from businesses running down stocks.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said she hoped for
stronger growth in the first quarter and maintained the
government's forecast for expansion this year of 2 percent.
 Analysts were less upbeat.
 ""This fairly mediocre figure confirms France is on a path of
sluggish growth,"" said Alexander Law, chief economist at Xerfi.
 ""If we take out technical and one-off elements, France is on
an annualised growth rhythm of 1.2 percent.""
 Italian expansion was also lower than expected, at just 0.1
percent, while Dutch growth surprised to the upside.
 The euro slipped against the dollar after the release of the
French and German data, although it then recovered to hold above
Monday's three-week low.
 Snow and icy weather certainly played a role, giving some
hope for a stronger start to 2011. Construction in particular
was hit hard and can be expected to rebound.
 Nick Kounis, economist at ABN AMRO in Amsterdam, said the
weather may have cut 0.3 percentage points off German growth,
but this would also have boosted output in the energy sector. 
 There was likely to be some compensation at the start of
2011, but the early data suggested euro zone expansion was
probably stable at 0.3 percent in the final three months.
 ""My feeling is that the underlying pace of growth was a
little stronger ... We are probably in a moderate recovery
scenario which will gather pace through the year as labour
markets get better,"" he said.
 ""It's not going to be incredibly buoyant.""
 Growth in the third quarter tempered after a very strong

2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter.
 
 TWIN-SPEED

 * Consumer inflation lower than forecast in Jan
 * Excluding food, inflation highest in at least decade
 * Price pressures building, points to policy tightening
 * Some signs that tightening so far starting to bite
 * Adjustment of CPI basket adds to inflation reading

 By Kevin Yao and Aileen Wang	
 BEIJING, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Chinese inflation hit a
lower-than-forecast 4.9 percent in January, but price pressures
excluding food were their strongest in at least a decade and
will force the central bank to keep tightening monetary policy.	
 In a tentative sign that its actions so far,
including higher interest rates and lending restrictions, have
started to bite, money growth eased to its slowest pace in six
months in January at 17.2 percent year on year.	
 ""The money supply and lending data suggest that government
efforts to clamp down on liquidity might be taking hold, though
broad-based inflation provides no leeway for the central bank to
relax its tightening stance,"" said Connie Tse, economist at
Forecast PTE in Singapore.	
 Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast January's inflation
at 5.3 percent, up from 4.6 percent in December. Contrary to
expectations, a change in how the consumer price index is
calculated added to the reading, rather than subtracted from it.	
 In one sign of the accumulating pressures, core inflation,
stripped of volatile food prices, jumped to 2.6 percent year on
year, the highest in at least a decade, from 2.1 percent a month
earlier. 
 In another sign, soaring global commodity costs pushed
producer prices up 6.6 percent in the year to January, up from
5.9 percent in December and well above the 6.1 percent rise
forecast by analysts. 
 ""The large increase in PPI inflation suggests that price
pressures will remain uncomfortably strong, at least for the
next few months,"" said Brian Jackson, economist with Royal Bank
of Canada in Hong Kong.	
 
 Asian stocks and global commodities edged down, having
jumped on Monday when rumours of the lower-than-expected
inflation figure first swirled through markets, easing fears
that China would need to unleash aggressive monetary tightening.	
 The Chinese central bank raised interest rates last week for
the second time in just over six weeks. It has also raised the
amount of money banks have to hold in reserve seven times since
the start of last year to try to mop up the excess cash in the
economy that has fuelled inflation.	
 
 NEW CALCULATION	
 The National Bureau of Statistics said its adjustment in the
way it calculates consumer price inflation better reflected the
evolution in Chinese consumption patterns.	
 ""February CPI is expected to be about 5.2 percent, and if it
is significantly lower than that, we may conclude that inflation
in China has changed fundamentally,"" said Gao Shanwen, chief
economist with Essence Securities in Beijing. ""Or we can say
that the CPI indicator itself is quite doubtful in terms of
reliability.""	
 Housing was given a much larger share of the new CPI basket,
while the weighting of food prices was reduced. These changes
were consistent with an economy that is fast becoming more
prosperous, allowing urbanites to spend a smaller portion of
their incomes on basic needs and more on big-ticket items.	
 Many in the market had expected that the adjustment,
conducted every five years, would lower the CPI, but the
statistics agency said the adjustment had actually added 0.024
percentage point to January's reading.	
 At least some investors and analysts took the statistics
agency at its word, and said that lower inflationary pressure
would reduce the need for a big dose of interest rate increases.
China's main stock index was steady after soaring 2.5
percent on Monday.	
 Ting Lu, an economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch,
noted that the biggest surprise was the 10.6 percent increase in
food prices year on year.	
 Many had thought a larger rise was in store, because the
Chinese New Year fell earlier in 2011 than 2010 and that was
expected to push up food costs in January.	
 ""The implication here is that inflation pressure might be
smaller than the market had thought,"" he said.	
 
 UPSIDE RISKS	
 Despite increasing interest rates and raising bank reserve
ratios, Chinese officials are still concerned about the rapid
expansion of bank lending.	
 Banks issued 1.04 trillion yuan in new loans in January, a
touch below the market consensus of 1.2 trillion yuan, but still
a hefty number when inflation is running near its fastest in
three years.	
 ""New yuan loans are at the lower end of the market's
expected range, indicating that the regulators' tightening
measures have yielded some effect,"" said Wang Hu, an analyst at
Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.	
 ""But the figure is still very strong and reflects a robust
demand for loans in the first month of this year,"" he added.	
 As a centrepiece of its economic policy, China sets loan
quotas to guide credit issuance by banks. Because of the
country's relatively stunted financial markets, these targets
are more important than interest rates in controlling the pace
of money growth and inflation in the Chinese economy.	
 Loan quotas took on extra urgency last month because banks
began the year by unleashing their customary early-year lending
surge at the same time as officials were trying to slow credit
expansion to rein in prices.	
 Another worry for China is a drought that has beset its
major wheat-producing region since October, threatening to push
up grain prices and fuel further food inflation.	
 ""The unfavourable weather conditions have raised supply-side
risks for production of agricultural products, and
simultaneously reinforced inflationary expectations,"" Qu
Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, said.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Tuesday,
supported by Asian demand, but undermined by scepticism over how
European leaders would come up with a quick and effective
solution to tackle the euro zone's debt and banking problems.
 The common currency hovered near a three-week low hit a day
earlier when reports about ailing lender WestLB triggered
another outbreak of the worries that have plagued the euro zone
over the past year. 
 Peripheral euro zone yield spreads have been widening in the
past week on uncertainty over a rescue package for the region,
and there was some disappointment after a meeting of European
finance ministers on Monday.
 The finance ministers agreed that a permanent rescue
mechanism to be set up from 2013 would total 500 billion euros,
but there was no agreement over how to beef up its existing
rescue fund.
 ""Initial optimism at the beginning of the year over a
comprehensive bailout package in the euro zone is now starting
to fade away,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM UFJ
 ""There's uncertainty over whether authorities will be able
to get on top of the situation. Our view is that the euro will
underperform over a 6-12 month period as the economy struggles.""
 The euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.3514,
holding above a three-week low of $1.3428 hit on Monday when
reports that rescue plans for WestLB were under threat triggered
selling..
 Traders reported Asian bids in the $1.3450 area helping to
support for now, while offers were seen at and above $1.3500.
 Technical analysts said last night's close under the 100-day
moving average for the first time in four weeks was a negative
signal. Next support was the 55-day moving average at $1.3361,
in line with the 50 percent retracement of the euro's January to
February rally.
 
 INVESTOR CAUTION
 Ireland's main opposition party -- slated to win a Feb. 25
poll -- has warned that it could unilaterally restructure bank
debt, possibly imposing losses on senior bond holders, if it
wins power this month.
 ""I suspect the market is starting to worry about sovereign
issues. Euro long positions still remain to be unwound. The euro
could fall to around $1.32-33,"" said Minori Uchida, senior
analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The yield differential is also turning less favourable for
the euro.
 Two-year German bonds yielded 0.54 percentage point more
than U.S. Treasuries -- the narrowest yield spread in nearly a
month and sharply below a two-year high of 0.82 percentage point
hit last month.
 The spread shrank largely because U.S. yields jumped this
month -- those on two-year paper are near eight-month highs.
 Traders think a strong reading in U.S. retail sales due at
1330 GMT could fuel a further rise in those yields, boosting the
dollar. Retail sales, which have been a bright spot in the
economy, are expected to show 0.6 percent growth in January from
the previous month. The dollar index was down 0.15 percent at
78.499.
 The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 83.50 yen, edging close to
a three-week high of 83.68 yen set on Friday. The Bank of Japan
kept rates on hold at the end of its two-day policy meeting as
widely expected.
 The Australian dollar was flat at $1.0030, showing little
reaction to China's consumer inflation -- at 4.9 percent below
market expectations of 5.3 percent -- though it was the same as
a whispered number that circulated in markets on Monday.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Chinese inflation data helped
ease investor concerns on Tuesday that the world's No 2 economy
will have to tighten monetary policy more aggressively, while
steady, if disappointing, European growth figures kept stocks
buoyant.
 Wall Street looked set for modest gains at the open.
 The dollar was weaker against a basket of major currencies,
and the euro rose despite worries about euro zone debt rising
up again.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.2 percent, not
far from last week's 30-month highs. Japan's Nikkei logged a
10-month closing high and Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.1
percent.
 Data showed that the euro zone economy ended last year with
stable growth, but it failed to meet expectations for an
acceleration as expansion in the three largest nations fell
short of forecasts and Greece and Portugal contracted.
 Countering this, German analyst and investor sentiment rose
slightly in February amid confidence in Germany's economic
recovery, a survey by the ZEW economic think tank showed.
 ""As we all know there was a cold snap in December, which
disrupted construction and trade activity, and the acceleration
in industrial activity was insufficient to offset this, so the
underlying picture looks more benign,"" said Martin van Vliet at
ING.
China's inflation was lower than expected at 4.9 percent in
the year to January.
 Although price pressures continued to build and will force
the central bank to stick to its course of gradual monetary
tightening, the report took the edge off concern about firmer
action.
 ""The data probably slightly eased expectations of immediate
tightening, although in the overall scheme of things, this
doesn't change the fact that China is still in a tightening
phase,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief economist at SMBC.
 Inflation pressures, particularly in emerging markets, have
been part of the motivation this year for investors to move into
developed stock markets.
 A number of those countries are also having problems,
however, particularly Britain, which came in at an annual 4.0
percent. U.S. consumer price data, meanwhile, will be reported
on Thursday.
 
 EURO PERIPHERY
 The euro gained on higher demand from Middle East and Asian
investors, but it was undermined by scepticism over how euro
zone leaders would come up with a quick and effective solution
to tackle its debt crisis.
 Peripheral euro zone yield spreads have been widening in the
past week on uncertainty over a rescue package for the region,
and there was some disappointment after a meeting of European
finance ministers on Monday.
 ""Initial optimism at the beginning of the year over a
comprehensive bailout package in the euro zone is now starting
to fade away,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM UFJ.
 The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.3534, not far from a
three-week low of $1.3428 hit on Monday.
 The 10-year German bond yield was up 3 basis point at 3.32
percent, while the two-year yield rose 2 basis points to 1.44
percent.

(Adds quotes, analyst, background)
 STOCKHOLM, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank raised
its key repo rate by a quarter point on Tuesday and said the
pace of monetary policy tightening would need to speed up
slightly given a rapidly expanding economy.
 The bank's decision to raise its key repo rate to 1.50
percent from 1.25 was widely expected by analysts but they said
the rise in the future rate path was less aggressive than
expected.
 The bank wants to make sure its inflation target is met and
has also spoken of the need to cool rapidly rising house prices.
 ""The assessment is also that the repo rate needs to be
raised somewhat faster in the coming period. Balance in the
economy requires continued repo rate increases,"" it said.
 ""To stabilise inflation close to the target of 2 percent and
to avoid resource utilisation being too high, the repo rate
needs to gradually increase,"" the Riksbank said in a statement.
 It said a gradual tightening cut the risk of imbalances and
could also contribute to a slower growth in household borrowing.
 The Swedish crown rose to a session high against the euro in
response, matching the previous day's 10-year high.
 All 18 analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast the
quarter-point hike and all but three expected another rate rise
at the bank's next meeting in April.
 As at earlier meetings, two of the six central bank's
governors disagreed with the decision to raise the repo rate and
wanted a more gradual path for rate rises.
 Sweden's economy, rapidly recovering from its deepest
post-World War Two recession in 2009, grew 6.9 percent
year-on-year in the third quarter of 2010 and its inflation rate
hit 2.3 percent in December.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg in January has said growth for
the whole of 2010 likely came in close to 6 percent. He expects
expansion of about 4 percent this year.
 ""They're raising the rate path over the whole line, which we
think is a wise decision. But the board is still divided since
two members voted against the rate hike and the rate path,"" said
Nordea analyst Annika Winsth.
 ""The market may have expected an even more hawkish message
from the Riksbank. That is why the market rates are falling.""

the Swedish central bank accompanying Tuesday's 25 basis point
hike in interest rates. 
 
 The Swedish economy is continuing to grow strongly.
Underlying inflationary pressures are still low in Sweden, but
are expected to increase as economic activity strengthens.
Rising energy and commodity prices also contribute to higher
inflation. To stabilise inflation close to the target of 2 per
cent and to avoid resource utilisation being too high, the repo
rate needs to gradually increase. The Executive Board of the
Riksbank has therefore decided to raise the repo rate by 0.25
percentage points to 1.5 per cent. The assessment is also that
the repo rate needs to be raised somewhat faster in the coming
period.
 Balance in the economy requires continued repo-rate increases
The Swedish economy remains strong, and the labour market
situation is steadily improving. Exports and investment are
increasing, and so is household consumption. Growth in the world
economy as a whole is also good, and prospects in the United
States look somewhat brighter. Developments in Europe are still
uncertain, as a result of the fiscal problems in several
European countries. On the whole, the prospects for continued
high growth in Sweden are good.
 International growth is contributing to rising energy and
commodity prices. The higher prices temporarily push up
inflation in Sweden, but are also expected to indirectly
continue affecting inflationary pressures throughout the
forecast period. At the same time, inflationary pressures are
low, as a result of the strong Swedish krona and low domestic
cost pressure. They are expected to rise, however, as wages
increase at a faster rate and the spare capacity in the economy
declines. To stabilise inflation close to the target of 2 per
cent and to avoid resource utilisation being too high, there is
a need to gradually increase the repo rate.
 The Executive Board of the Riksbank has therefore decided to
raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5 per cent,
and to adjust the forecast for the repo rate upwards in relation
to the December forecast. A gradual rise in the repo rate
reduces the risk of imbalances building up in the Swedish
economy, and may also contribute to a slower growth in household
borrowing.
 Good growth  but there are risks
 As always, the forecasts for the economy and monetary policy
are based on the information currently available and new
information further ahead may lead to changes in these
forecasts. If inflation in Sweden increases as a result, for
example, of higher energy prices abroad or stronger domestic
demand, monetary policy may need to be tightened more than in
the main scenario of the Monetary Policy Report. If, on the
other hand, productivity improves unexpectedly quickly or the
krona strengthens further so that inflation is lower than
expected, it may be necessary to increase the repo rate at a
slower rate in the future.
 Deputy Governor Karolina Ekholm and Deputy Governor Lars
E.O. Svensson entered a reservation against the decision to
raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5 per cent
and against the repo rate path of the main scenario in the
Monetary Policy Report.
 They preferred a repo rate equal to 1.25 per cent and a repo
rate path that then gradually rises to 3.25 per cent by the end
of the forecast period. Such a repo rate path implies a CPIF
inflation closer to 2 per cent and a faster reduction of
unemployment towards a longer-run sustainable rate. 
 The minutes from the Executive Board's monetary policy
discussion will be published on 28 February 2011. The decision
on the repo rate will apply with effect from 16 February. A
press conference with Governor Stefan Ingves and Per Jansson,
Head of the Monetary Policy Department, will be held today at 11
a.m. in the Riksbank.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Tuesday
but faced headwinds in moving further away from a three-week low
hit a day earlier when reports about ailing lender WestLB
triggered another outbreak of worries on euro zone debt and
banking problems.
 Market players said the euro could slip back if upcoming U.S.
data, including retail sales figures later in the day, paints an
improving picture of the economy, which could push up U.S.
interest rates further to the detriment of the euro.
 ""The dollar is likely to be bought back more. Investors have
come to think that the Fed will not extend its quantitative
easing beyond June, and markets will try to bet on an eventual
rate hike by the Fed for now,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief
economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
 The euro ticked up in Asia as traders tried to take out
stop-loss orders around $1.3510-20, but lacked the momentum to go
further.
 In late Asian trade, it traded at $1.3515, about 0.2 percent
higher than late U.S. levels. It hit a three-week low of $1.3428
on Monday, when reports that rescue plans for WestLB were under
threat triggered selling in the currency.
 Talk of Asian central bank bids means immediate support for
the single currency lies under $1.3450 and below that, key
support now stands at $1.3360, the 50 percent retracement of a
January to February rally.
 But many traders expect the currency to struggle to gain
traction amid the rekindled worries about the currency bloc's
debt and banking problems.
 Peripheral euro zone yield spreads have been widening in the
past week on uncertainty over a rescue package for the region,
and there was some disappointment after a meeting of European
finance ministers on Monday.
 The finance ministers agreed that a permanent rescue
mechanism to be set up from 2013 would total 500 billion euros,
but there was no agreement over how to beef up its existing
rescue fund.
 While policymakers have said they will hammer out a deal by
March, analysts noted that there are some political events that
could shake investor confidence on the euro in coming days.
 They said a German local election on Feb. 20 could make
Berlin reluctant to dish out aid to indebted countries.
 Ireland's main opposition party -- slated to win a Feb. 25
poll -- has warned that it could unilaterally restructure bank
debt, possibly imposing losses on senior bond holders, if it wins
power this month.
 ""I suspect the market is starting to worry about sovereign
issues. Euro long positions still remain to be unwound. The euro
could fall to around $1.32-33,"" said Minori Uchida, senior
analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The yield differential is also turning less favourable for
the euro.
 Two-year German bonds yielded 0.54 percentage point more than
U.S. Treasuries -- the narrowest yield spread in nearly a month
and sharply below a two-year high of 0.82 percentage point hit
last last month.
 SPREAD SHRINK
 The spread shrank largely because U.S. yields jumped this
month and two-year U.S. yields are near eight-month highs.
 Traders think a strong reading in U.S. retail sales due at
1330 GMT could fuel a rise in U.S. yields, thereby boosting the
dollar's rally. Retail sales, which have been a bright spot in
the economy, are expected to show a 0.6 percent rise in January
from the previous month.
 ""The greenback may regain its footing over the next 24 hours
of trading as the economic docket is expected to reinforce an
improved outlook for future growth,"" said David Song, currency
analyst at DailyFX.
 ""As market participants expect retail sales to increase for
the seventh consecutive month in January, the expansion in
private sector activity is likely to reinforce an enhanced
outlook for the world's largest economy as household spending
remains one of the leading drivers of growth.""
 Against the yen, the dollar gained 0.2 percent to 83.50 yen,
edging close to a three-week high of 83.68 yen set on Friday.
 The Bank of Japan kept rates on hold at the end of its
two-day policy meeting as widely expected.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.10 percent to $1.0037.
It was helped by China's consumer price index that came in at 4.9
percent, below market expectations of 5.3 percent, though it was
exactly the same as a whispered number that swirled through
markets yesterday.
 ""The data probably slightly eases expectations of immediate
tightening, although in the overall scheme of things, this
doesn't change the fact that China is still in a tightening
phase,"" said SMBC's Yamashita.

 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Britain's January inflation
numbers will make difficult reading for the Bank of England at a
time when its inflation-fighting credentials are increasingly
coming into question.
 Figures at 0930 GMT are forecast to show annual consumer
price inflation surged to 4.0 percent from 3.7 percent in
December, its highest level since November 2008 and double the
central bank's target.
 Retail price inflation, which some economists consider a
more accurate gauge of the cost of living, is forecast to rise
even higher, to 5.1 percent. 
 Britain's central bank is nervous that an interest rate rise
could snuff out a fragile economic recovery. It has kept rates
at a record low 0.5 percent for almost two years, arguing that
inflation was being driven by one-off factors such as rises in
sales tax, currency weakness and spikes in commodity prices.
 Building price pressures, however, have encouraged investors
to bet that an interest rate rise will not be long in coming.
Money markets are pricing in a quarter-point rate rise by May,
and at least one more by the end of the year. 
 ""Given UK markets' current sensitivity to inflation,
January's release is a very important one,"" said Philip Shaw, an
economist at Investec.
 Shaw believes retail price inflation could be as high as 5.5
percent, a level not seen since 1991.
 
 TAX CHANGES
 January's figures are more tricky to forecast than normal
because they will be affected by several tax changes, the
biggest of which being the rise in VAT -- from 17.5 percent to
20 percent -- on Jan. 4.
 It is hard to calculate in advance how much of that tax rise
was passed on by retailers. Some may have raised prices ahead of
that date while others may have decided to absorb some of the
tax in a bid to lure in shoppers.
 Oil, commodity and food prices are all expected to have had
a significant upward impact on the index last month.
 Inflation has now been at least a percentage point above the
BoE's 2 percent target for an entire year, and Governor Mervyn
King will be forced to write another letter to the government
explaining what remedial action will be taken.
 That letter will be published at 1030 GMT, an hour after the
inflation figures are released.
 King has so far blamed the rise in inflation on external
factors, which he says the BoE can do nothing about, and one-off
tax changes, whose effect on inflation will be temporary. 
 However, building pipeline pressures and growing concerns
the BoE is going soft on inflation mean King might adopt a
harder stance.
 The BoE will publish new quarterly growth and inflation
forecasts on Wednesday and investors will scruntinise King's
comments for clues on what those forecasts will hold.
 The BoE may be prepared to look through short-term price
pressures but any indication that medium-term price pressures
are rising would be seen as a signal that rates will rise sooner
rather than later.

 * Embattled Japan PM struggles to decide on free trade talks	
 * Trans-Pacific Partnership may boost GDP, shake up economy	
 * Japanese business in favour, farmers implacably opposed	
 
 By Alan Wheatley, Global Economics Correspondent	
 BEIJING, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Everyone who is willing Japan to
find the elixir to revive its listless economy and put off its
day of reckoning with the bond markets should pencil June in
their calendars.	
 That is when Prime Minister Naoto Kan, if he is still in
office -- and it is a big if -- will decide whether Japan will
enter talks about a U.S.-led Asia-Pacific free trade pact, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).	
 If the unpopular Kan succeeds -- an even bigger if, given
the opposition of the powerful farm lobby -- the way would be
open for Japan to negotiate joining an embryonic free trade
grouping that the Cabinet Office reckons could add 0.5 percent a
year to growth by lowering barriers to goods and services.	
 Proponents say an ambitious pact, by forcing Japan to open
its own markets, would also galvanise a society that has watched
impotently as China has overtaken it to become Asia's largest
economy -- a fact Japan confirmed on Monday. 
 Signing up for the TPP is vital to make sure big Japanese
firms are not at a disadvantage to their South Korean and
Chinese rivals, said Aurelia George Mulgan, a professor of
Japanese politics with the University of New South Wales at the
Australian Defense Force Academy in Canberra.	
 ""They've got to be part of the TPP, otherwise they're going
to be on the sidelines of the Asian boom looking in,"" George
Mulgan said.	
 ""Asia has become a substitute for their domestic
market,"" she added. ""They need the ingredients for future
success, and this is part of the story.""	
 President Barack Obama is also counting on the TPP to help
him achieve his goal of doubling U.S. exports within five years.	
 The United States is negotiating with Australia, Brunei,
Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.	
 The aim is to complete the substance of a deal by the time
Obama hosts the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Hawaii in November.	
 Separately, the Association of South East Asian Nations is
exploring closer economic integration with six neighbours,
including China, with which the 10-member group has signed
bilateral free trade agreements.	
 Ganeshan Wignaraja with the Asian Development Bank in Manila
believes the needs of the business community to integrate
regional production chains that revolve around China dictate
that the TPP and ASEAN+6 strands will fuse over time.	
 ""I can't conceive of an agreement in the
Asia-Pacific that doesn't have China in it,"" Wignaraja
said.	
 ""My own view is that we will have a series of interlinked
agreements with variable coverage of issues and membership and
eventually there'll be some sense of convergence. We might be a
decade out from that,"" he added.	
 
 FARMERS IN CLOVER	
 The immediate problem for Japan is that the existing TPP
participants could drive an impossibly hard bargain.	
 The TPP is meant to eliminate all trade barriers among
signatories within 10 years, and U.S. businesses have urged
Obama to bar Japan unless it is serious about dismantling
barriers to its agriculture, services and manufacturing markets.

 Japan's farmers, average age 66, produce only 1 percent of
national output. But since rural voters have disproportionate
clout under Japan's electoral system, Tokyo has protected
farmers with tariffs of 778 percent on rice and 252 percent on
wheat. 
 It has also largely fenced off the agricultural sector in
market-opening pacts, going so far as to exclude goldfish and
cut flowers from its 2002 deal with Singapore.	
 Exposing agriculture and other coddled sectors to
competition would thus be a sea change. It could break what Kan
has called ""a sense of deadlock"" that has persisted for nearly
20 years.	
 ""The key is to open up the country, both in terms of
thinking and of the economy,"" Kan said last month.

 Shujiro Urata, a professor of economics at Waseda University
in Tokyo, said removing trade barriers would lead to a more
efficient allocation of resources and force firms to innovate.	
 ""Indeed, observing increased competitive pressure from
increased imports, the Japanese government may realise the need
to undertake policy reforms such as deregulation so that
Japanese firms could adopt competitive business strategies under
a freer and more open business environment,"" he wrote in an
article for the East Asia Forum.	
 
 DEBT MOUNTAIN	
 Put another way, deciding whether to negotiate an ambitious
free-trade deal goes to the heart of how Japan sees its future
-- open and dynamic or shackled to an economic structure that no
longer seems fit for purpose.	
 Japan remains prosperous and has willing buyers for its
bonds. Markets ignored a recent S&P downgrade. .	
 But Japan has a rapidly greying population, and the
inexorable arithmetic of debt dynamics means that brisker
economic growth is needed to stabilise its gross public debt
ratio, which is already more than double GDP.	
 That is why the boost to activity that TPP promises is so
important, according to Trade Minister Banri Kaieda.	
 ""If Japan wants to achieve a 3-4 percent growth rate, it
must connect with Asia and, in the longer term, Africa, Latin
America, and other fast-growing economies,"" he told the recent
World Economic Forum in Davos. ""We cannot otherwise provide
social security in this ageing society.""	
 But George Mulgan, the Japanese-politics professor in
Canberra, is far from sure that Kan will be in office long
enough, let alone show himself strong enough, to sign up for the
TPP.	
 ""They will try to find a way to join, but at a minimal cost
to vested interests,"" she said. ""It depends on how tough other
countries are with them.""

 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were
broadly steady On Tuesday after traders took China's
closely-watched inflation data in their stride, while the euro
regained some ground after hitting a three-week low the previous
day. 
 London copper futures rallied to a record high after lower
than expected consumer price figures from China soothed concerns
that Beijing might adopt a more aggressive monetary tightening
regime to fight inflation. 
 Chinese consumer price inflation accelerated to 4.9 percent
in the year to January. It matched the widespread figure that
swirled through markets on Monday, but was below the earlier
consensus forecast of 5.3 percent. 
 Analysts remained wary of a build-up in China's price
pressures, saying Beijing could raise interest rates further,
given continued rises in food prices. 
 ""The data probably slightly eased expectations of immediate
tightening, although in the overall scheme of things, this
doesn't change the fact that China is still in a tightening
phase,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief economist at SMBC. 
 MSCI's Asia Pacific index excluding Japan ,
which snapped five straight sessions of losses on Monday, was up
0.08 percent. 
 The Shanghai stock market rose more than 1 percent
by 0540 GMT, compared with a rise of 0.38 percent before the
Chinese inflation data came out. On Monday, it jumped 2.5
percent on market rumours of the inflation data.	
 Japanese stocks edged higher to log a 10-month
closing high. The Nikkei average ended up 0.20 percent at
10,746.67. 
 South Korea's KOSPI gave up some initial gains,
weighed by falls in automakers including Hyundai Motor
, while Hong Kong stocks fell 0.45 percent. 
 
 EURO INCHES UP, BUT TREND WEAK	
 In the currency market, the euro edged up 0.24 percent to
around $1.3520 , after falling as low as $1.3426
overnight, as traders tried to take out stop-loss orders.

 But uncertainty remained over concrete solutions to Europe's
fiscal problems, keeping the euro vulnerable. Worries about
rescue plans for ailing German lender WestLB have also added to
the single currency's struggle. 
 On Monday, euro zone finance ministers agreed that
a permanent rescue mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism,
to be set up from 2013, would total 500 billion euros, but are
waiting for leaders' guidance to agree changes to the existing
bailout fund . 
 Traders are also focusing on U.S. retail sales data for
clues on the dollar's near-term outlook. The figures, due later
in the day, are expected to show a 0.6 percent rise in January
from the previous month. 
 ""The greenback may regain its footing over the next 24 hours
of trading as the economic docket is expected to reinforce an
improved outlook for future growth,"" said David Song, currency
analyst at DailyFX. 
 European GDP data, also due out on Tuesday, is expected to
show slight growth in the euro zone.	
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.18 percent to
around 83.45 yen , nearing a three-week high of 83.68 yen
set on Friday. 
 There was muted reaction after the Bank of Japan left its
policy rate unchanged steady, as expected. 
 The Aussie rose to the day's high of around $1.0058
after China's CPI data eased worries about aggressive monetary
tightening by the world's No.2 economy, which attracts
Australian exports.	
 Subdued expectations of more aggressive rate hikes
by China also helped send three-month copper on the London Metal
Exchange to as much as $30 to $10,190 a tonne. Spot gold
also inched higher. 
 London crude prices extended gains to
stand above $103 a barrel, buoyed by signs of firm oil demand in
China, and as unrest in the Middle East sparked fears of a
potential supply disruption. 
 U.S. crude for March delivery rebounded above $85 a
barrel, after falling to 2-1/2 month lows in the previous
session.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed toward
last week's 30-month high and copper surged to all-time peaks
on Monday after an unexpected jump in Chinese imports
underscored the country's strong appetite for raw materials.
 The euro dropped to a three-week low against the dollar on
concerns surrounding the fate of German lender WestLB. Rising
bond yields for indebted euro zone economies added to worries
about the currency.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) copper for three-month delivery
 hit a record $10,170.25 per tonne in after-hours trade,
having closed up $199 at $10,160, matching the previous high.
On New York's COMEX metals exchange, benchmark copper 
traded near record highs set last week.
 Preliminary Chinese trade data showed copper imports jumped
a surprise 5.7 percent to 364,420 tonnes in January. The
volume, which was up 24.7 percent from January 2010, was the
highest since September. For details, see [ID:nTOE71D037]
 ""It could very well be that the Chinese economy is running
hotter than anyone thinks,"" said Bart Melek, vice president and
director of commodities with TD Bank Financial Group. Copper is
often viewed as a barometer for the global economy due to its
extensive use in the construction and power sectors.
 Talk of slower-than-expected Chinese inflation in January
also helped ease worries about policy tightening and slowing
growth, boosting stock prices worldwide. The official data will
be announced on Tuesday.  [ID:nTOE71D01T]
 But analysts cautioned against concluding that Beijing
would waver in its campaign to tighten policy further, given
the continued increases in global commodity prices and the
still-ample pool of excess cash in the economy.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.5
percent, having hit its highest level since August 2008 last
week. The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> also
gained 0.5 percent.
 U.S. stocks <.DJI> <.IXIC> <.SPX> ended little changed in
the lowest volume so far this year. European shares closed at a
29-month high <.FTEU3>, while Shanghai stocks <.SSEC> hit an
eight-week high.
 Financial markets showed a muted reaction to President
Barack Obama's budget proposal that would cut the U.S. deficit
by $1.1 trillion over 10 years and set the stage for a bitter
fight with Republicans who want tougher spending controls. See

 EU MEETING
 The euro  dropped against the dollar for a third
day, breaking below a crucial 100-day moving average at $1.3543
on electronic platform EBS as a European finance ministers
meeting yielded little progress on the region's fiscal
problems.
 European finance ministers assessed ways of strengthening
their 440 billion euro rescue fund, but Germany remained
reluctant to bolster the facility known as the EFSF without
commitments on closer economic coordination.
 ""We have some serious questions over what's going to happen
with the EU meeting this week and whether or not they will come
to any kind of conclusion on the EFSF,"" said Andrew Busch,
global currency and public policy strategist at BMO Capital
Markets in Chicago.
 The euro also came under pressure after sources told
Reuters that German financial regulator BaFin is involved in
talks about the restructuring of WestLB as the bank struggles
to come up with a rescue deal. [ID:nBAT005995]
 Weakness in the euro helped push the U.S. dollar index,
which measures the greenback against a basket of major
currencies, to a three-week high of 78.873 <.DXY>.
 U.S. crude oil futures  ended lower for a second
straight session, weighed down by high domestic inventories,
but gold futures  closed higher on fears that Egypt's
unrest could spread across the Arab world.
 Longer-dated U.S. Treasury debt prices rose with benchmark
yields holding just under recent highs as investors awaited
data later in the week to gauge the state of the economy and
how far yields may need to rise to account for growth.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a three-week
low against the dollar on Monday and was viewed as vulnerable
to extended losses after a European finance ministers' meeting
provided little clarity about concrete solutions to the
region's fiscal problems.
 The single currency underperformed the dollar for a third
straight day, dropping below a crucial 100-day moving average
at $1.3543 on electronic platform EBS. Further losses below
$1.3500 could take the euro down to support at $1.3360, the 50
percent retracement of the January to February rally.
""The euro remains below $1.35 as its vulnerabilities were
again exposed,"" said David Watt, senior fixed income and
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 European finance ministers met in Brussels on Monday to
discuss ways of strengthening the 440 billion euro bailout
fund. But Germany remains reluctant to bolster the facility
without euro zone commitments on closer economic coordination.
Germany's support as Europe's largest economy is essential to
any deal. For details, see [ID:nLDE71D0JU]
 In addition, news about troubled German bank WestLB also
added to pressure on the euro. WestLB [WDLG.UL] is preparing to
suggest its own break-up to the European Commission on Tuesday
to win approval for billions in state aid, three people
familiar with the matter said. [ID:nLDE71D1FT]
 In late trading, the euro  slipped 0.4 percent to
$1.3485. The single euro zone currency rallied a bit in the
afternoon after it triggered stops that took it to a North
American session high at $1.3506. But it could not gain any
traction beyond that.
 Greg Michalowski, chief FX analyst at New York-based FX
online broker FXDD, said the euro has a bearish bias if it is
trading below the 100-day moving average at $1.3543.
 Traders, however, said losses in the euro have been limited
by central bank buying seeking to diversify out of U.S.
dollars.
 The dollar was up around 0.2 percent on the day against a
currency basket to 78.598 <.DXY>, trading above its 100-day
moving average for the first time in four weeks.
 The dollar fell against the yen for the first time in nine
days, dropping 0.2 percent to 83.30 yen .
 The increase in sovereign debt risk has pushed 10-year
government bond yields higher for Ireland, Greece, Portugal and
Spain, with the spread to German 10-year government bond yields
widening.
 That said, overall euro sentiment has improved
significantly since December. The 25 delta risk reversals, a
measure of risk sentiment, on front-end euro/dollar
 are still showing a bias toward puts, or
expectations for a currency decline, but the puts have become
less extreme. On Monday, euro puts were trading at -1.55 vols,
rising from -2.60 vols in early December.
 Meanwhile, implied volatility on the one-month euro/dollar
contract  declined for a second straight day, trading
around 10.80 percent on Monday. Volatility has been benign so
far this year, trading well below December's highs around 15
percent, suggesting a more tranquil market than that of the
last quarter.
 European bond auctions were also a key focus for investors
on Monday.
 Italy sold 5.2 billion euros of five- and 30-year bonds in
a sale that went smoothly despite renewed concerns about
peripheral countries' debt loads after Portugal's syndicated
deal struggled in the secondary market last
week.[ID:nLDE71D0I8]
 Portuguese 10-year bonds were the hardest hit on Monday in
the euro zone, with benchmark debt yields in Portugal
 climbing to around all-time highs above 7
percent.
 ""We think the odds that Portugal will have to seek an
assistance package are increasing,"" said Marc Chandler, global
head of FX strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 Spanish bond auctions will be a focus for euro zone
investors on Thursday, while investors await details of a
European debt rescue fund next month.
 Focus on the euro zone's concerns has overshadowed
President Barack Obama's 2012 budget plan, which aims to slash
the U.S. deficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years. For full

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed towards
last week's 30-month high and copper surged to all-time peaks
on Monday after an unexpected jump in Chinese imports showed
the country's strong appetite for raw materials.
 The euro  dropped to a three-week low of $1.3428
on trading platform EBS on concerns surrounding the fate of
German lender WestLB. Rising bond yields for indebted euro zone
economies added to worries about the single currency.
 Copper for three-month delivery  on the London Metal
Exchange closed at $10,160 from $9,961 a tonne on Friday, after
hitting a record high of $10,168.50 earlier. On New York's
COMEX metals exchange, benchmark copper  traded near
record highs set last week.
 Used extensively in the power and construction sectors,
copper has surged more than 60 percent since last June. Robust
demand from emerging nations and limited supply are seen as
increasingly bullish for prices.
 Preliminary Chinese trade data showed copper imports jumped
a surprise 5.7 percent to 364,420 tonnes in January. For
details, see [ID:nTOE71D037]
 ""The market's taken these numbers in a very bullish way,""
said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Credit Agricole. ""China's
appetite is insatiable.""
 Talk of slower-than-expected Chinese inflation also helped
revive investors' risk appetite and boost stock and commodity
prices in general.
 But analysts cautioned against concluding that Beijing

the continued increases in global commodity prices and the

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a three-week
low against the dollar on Monday with more losses expected as
euro zone debt difficulties and a deluge of economic data and
events this week kept investors on edge.
 The euro underperformed the dollar for a third straight
day, dropping below the widely perceived pivotal level of
$1.35.
 Ten-year government bond yields for Ireland, Greece,
Portugal and Spain were all higher, with the spread to German
10-year government bond yields widening. News surrounding the
European debt crisis should be this week's main foreign
exchange driver.
 The euro slipped 0.4 percent to $1.3487, partly attributed
to news about troubled German bank WestLB.
 WestLB is preparing to suggest its own break-up to the
European Commission on Tuesday to win approval for billions in
state aid, three people familiar with the matter said.
 The move triggered stop-losses on the break of $1.3500,
taking the euro below support at $1.3483, the 38.2 percent
retracement of its rally from January to February. Stops were
noted in the upper $1.34s, a trader said.
 While the euro briefly dipped below $1.3430, this could
prove to be the low of the day, likely capping around $1.3480,
according to Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""The tone may remain fragile as peripheral issues are in
the forefront.""
 Nevertheless, overall euro sentiment has improved
significantly since December. The 25 delta risk reversals, a
measure of risk sentiment, on front-end euro/dollar are still
showing a bias toward puts, or expectations for a currency
decline, but the puts have become less extreme. On Monday, euro
puts were trading at -1.55 vols, rising from -2.60 vols in
early December.
 Meanwhile, implied volatility on the one-month euro/dollar
contract declined for a second straight day, trading at around
10.80 percent on Monday. Volatility has been benign so far this
year, suggesting a more tranquil market than in November and
December.
 ""Portuguese 10-year bonds are the hardest hit today in the
euro zone,"" Chandler said. Benchmark government debt yields in
Portugal have climbed to around all-time highs above 7
percent.
 ""We think the odds that Portugal will have to seek an
assistance package are increasing,"" he said.
 Spanish bond auctions will be a focus for euro zone
investors on Thursday, while investors await details of a
European debt rescue fund next month. This has investors wary
of the euro.
 Greg Anderson, G10 strategist at CitiFX in New York, said
the next technical level should be $1.3433.
 ""President Obama's budget plan is taking a back seat to
events overseas,"" he said.
 President Barack Obama's 2012 budget plan would slash the
U.S. deficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years.
 CitiFX's Anderson said the proposal did not sway the dollar
and markets await clarity over what happens with negotiations
with Republicans in Congress.
 The dollar was up around 0.2 percent on the day against a
currency basket to 78.631, trading above its 100-day moving
average for the first time in four weeks.
 The dollar fell against the yen for the first time in nine
days, dropping 0.2 percent at 83.25 yen.
 This week ushers in a flurry of data, with euro zone fourth
quarter gross domestic product numbers due Tuesday, the same
day as New York manufacturing data and U.S. retail sales.
 With global inflation a hot topic, a number of countries
will release consumer price index data this week, including
Britain, the United States, Sweden and Canada.
 ""While the market will undoubtedly trade around these data
points, there will likely be bigger interest in how central
banks frame future policy moves,"" Anderson said. ""The BoE (Bank
of England) gets its chance to do so with the quarterly
inflation report that will be released on Wednesday, which is
the same day that minutes from the last (Federal Reserve
monetary policy board) FOMC meeting will be released.""
 The focus later this week will be meetings of Group of 20
finance officials on Friday and Saturday in Paris.

exports in January. [ID:nLDE71D0FH]
 But analysts cautioned against concluding that Beijing would
waver in its campaign to tighten policy further, given the
continued increases in global commodity prices and the
still-ample pool of excess cash in the economy.
 ""The market is taking it positively. But I think it is still
important to bear in mind that the underlying trend is rising
and, especially with the recent drought, upside risk for food
prices remain,"" said Connie Tse, an economist at Forecast Pte in
Singapore.
 The Chinese leadership has put fighting inflation at the top
of its agenda this year, declaring a shift in monetary policy to
""prudent"" from the previous ""appropriately loose"" setting.
 Last week, the central bank raised interest rates for the
second time in just over six weeks, indicating that risks are
tilting towards more aggressive monetary tightening than
investors expect. [ID:nTOE71904U] [ID:nTOE718017]
 
 CHANGING
 Economists also said that a surprisingly low inflation
reading in January may mainly be the result of changes in how
the consumer price index (CPI) is calculated.
 The National Bureau of Statistics regularly adjusts the
composition of the CPI basket, conducting small tweaks every
year and a big adjustment every five years. It is due for the
five-yearly major shift.
 Food currently makes up a third of the CPI basket, and the
statistics agency is expected to reduce that weighting. Since
rising food prices have led the pick-up in inflation in recent
months, such a change would likely lead to a lower inflation
reading.
 Another worry for Chinese policy makers is the still rapid
expansion of bank lending, despite seven increases in banks'
required reserves over the past year and constant admonitions to
bankers to rein in their issuance of credit.
 A Reuters poll showed that Chinese banks started the year
with their usual lending frenzy, likely making about 1.2
trillion yuan in new loans in the first month.
 That would amount to about 17 percent of the 7 trillion yuan
in loans that many assume is the government's full-year target
for 2011. [ID:nTOE71904U]
 Data issued on Monday showed that China's trade surplus fell
to its lowest in nine months in January after imports surged,
boding well for the government's drive to rebalance the economy
towards domestic consumption. [ID:nTOE71A01I]
 But analysts say the surplus could rebound in coming months
and that other sources of liquidity creation, including foreign
investment and hot money inflows, could persist.

 By Karolina Slowikowska and Marcin Goclowski
 WARSAW, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Poland is in a race against time
to ensure inflation stays under control and must raise rates
further, a member of the bank's Monetary Policy Council (MPC),
Anna Zielinska-Glebocka, said on Monday.
 In some of the most hawkish comments since the MPC raised
its key interest rate last month by 25 basis points to 3.75
percent, marking the start of a new tightening cycle, she also
said she did not expect the zloty to appreciate much this year.
 ""Forecasts show that core inflation will be rising and this
is information for us that we must think about monetary
tightening ... I think that not being late with a rate hike will
be the council's main challenge,"" Anna Zielinska-Glebocka told a
Thomson Reuters Economic Spot panel.
 ""There is a need for reaction from the Monetary Policy
Council, particularly when we look at core inflation.""
 Earlier on Monday, another member of the 10-strong MPC,
Elzbieta Chojna-Duch, said Poland did not necessarily need a
rate increase in March.. Analysts polled by Reuters see the next
rate increase coming in April.
 The zloty, under pressure on Monday, firmed a tad after her
Zielinska-Glebocka's comments to trade at 3.93 to the euro --
about 0.5 percent up since the start of 2011 -- before easing
back in choppy trade.
 Zielinska-Glebocka said inflationary pressure had risen
further since the MPC's last sitting in January and that annual
inflation may peak at 3.6 or 3.7 percent in the first half of
2011, well above the central bank's 2.5 percent target.
 Analysts expect inflation to have hit 3.4 percent in
January, up from 3.1 percent in December.
 ""The way the situation develops will determine the depth of
rate hikes. Maybe there will be one (hike) needed, maybe three,
maybe four -- I don't know.""
 Asked whether another rate hike may come as early as the
MPC's next sitting on Mar. 1-2, Zielinska-Glebocka said:
 ""I wouldn't want to say what we will do in March ... It
seems there is a need to tighten monetary policy. The depth of
tightening will be decided by many factors.""
 
 ZLOTY PROSPECTS
 In contrast to some other policymakers, Zielinska-Glebocka
played down the zloty's possible help in the central bank's
battle against rising inflationary pressures and said the unit
was probably going to drift in a range, without a clear trend.
 ""We are at a crossroads where I cannot predict whether or by
how much the zloty could appreciate. There are so many factors
and the zloty is very volatile. I don't think appreciation will
be very strong. In my view, the zloty will be drifting this
year, but I could be wrong,"" Zielinska-Glebocka said.
 ""This (zloty appreciation) cannot be an instrument replacing
other instruments in monetary policy,"" she added.
 Zielinska-Glebocka's comments on the zloty could signal a
growing concern among policymakers that the strong zloty which
some may have hoped for may not now materialise.

(Adds agreement on Praet for ECB board, paragraph 20)
 By Annika Breidthardt and John O'Donnell
 BRUSSELS, Feb 14 (Reuters) - European finance ministers
assessed ways of strengthening their 440 billion euro rescue
fund on Monday, but Germany remained reluctant to bolster the
facility without commitments on closer economic coordination.
 Monday's talks are supposed to prepare the ground for a
""comprehensive package"" of measures European leaders are hoping
to agree in late March to resolve the year-long debt crisis.
 While there is no consensus yet on all potential changes,
the euro zone appears to be coming close to an agreement that
the rescue fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF) -- should be made stronger and more flexible.
 ""The most important thing is to make sure the 440 billion
can be used, give it a little bit more flexibility to operate on
the market and I think there should be political consensus
around that,"" Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said.
 The EFSF has euro zone government guarantees for up to 440
billion euros ($596 billion), but its effective capacity is only
about 250 billion because of guarantees built into the fund.
 That sum could be insufficient to bail out more than two
countries if both Portugal and potentially Spain were to follow
Greece and Ireland in needing a bailout.
 To increase the effective lending capacity, euro zone
countries are considering either raising their guarantees for
the fund or raising guarantees and injecting cash into it.
 
 NO DECISIONS ON MONDAY
 Ministers will also explore making the fund more flexible,
which could include allowing it to buy the bonds of distressed
countries, or other similar steps.
 The ministers are to narrow down the number of options on
the table, but make no final decisions.
 ""We will have no decisions today, but we have said it will
have to be a complete package with all three elements: the
competitiveness pact, the ESM (European Stability Mechanism)
agreement and the EFSF by the end of March,"" German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on entering the meeting.
 EU leaders are to meet on March 24-25 to strike a deal on
the comprehensive package of steps. Schaeuble repeated the
German position that no increase in the EFSF was immediately
necessary since no country was applying for a new bailout now.
 Germany, whose support as Europe's largest economy is
essential to any deal, is reluctant to back an increase in the
EFSF unless other euro zone member states sign up to measures to
cut spending and make their economies more competitive.
 Financial markets were calmer in the first few weeks of this
year, but renewed concerns have emerged in the past 10 days,
after EU leaders failed to make progress at a summit on Feb. 4.
 Yields on Portugal's 10-year bonds set new record highs last
week at 7.65 percent on a perceived lack of progress towards
resolving the bloc's crisis. Portugal is regarded as the next
likely candidate for a bailout.
""Concerns about a European debt rescue plan will remain in
place until March, and that is definitely a risk for the euro,""
said Sven Schubert, currency strategist at Credit Suisse in
Zurich.
 
 MORE COMPETITIVENESS
 The ""competitiveness pact"", backed by France, envisages
higher retirement ages, national laws to cap debt, a common
corporate tax base and an end to indexing wages to inflation. 
 But other euro zone countries complain the Franco-German
proposal has not even been properly presented to them and while
no one opposes the idea of becoming more competitive, many
disagree with elements of the pact reported in the press.
 ""We are in complete ignorance of the elements of this pact.
It will not be part of today's meeting, but for the European
Council on March 11,"" Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker
told reporters before the meeting.
 ""It will have to be determined then what the additional
value is of such a pact.""
 At the start of their meeting, the ministers agreed to
recommend that Belgium's Peter Praet be nominated to the
executive board of the European Central Bank over his Slovak
rival Elena Kohutikova, an EU source told Reuters.
 Later on Monday euro zone ministers and ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet will be joined by ministers from the 10
non-euro members of the European Union to discuss the European
Stability Mechanism, which is to take over crisis resolution
from mid-2013.
 A euro zone source taking part in the preparations for the
meeting said the European Commission had proposed that the size
of the ESM should be 500 billion euros for the support of
solvent countries with liquidity problems.
 But several euro zone sources said there was no agreement
yet on the Commission proposal.

 By Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is likely to
smooth the way for a future rise in interest rates with its
quarterly economic forecasts on Wednesday, and try to allay
concerns that it is going soft on inflation.
 The central bank left borrowing costs on hold at 0.5 percent
this month, even though an estimate for January due on Tuesday
is likely to have shown that consumer prices inflation climbed
to 4 percent -- double its 2 percent target.
 This would force BoE Governor Mervyn King to write another
letter to finance minister George Osborne explaining the
overshoot.
 Investors reckon the central bank may have to start
tightening policy sooner rather than later to bring inflation
back on track, and money markets are almost fully pricing in a
25 basis point rise in borrowing costs by May.
 Most city economists do not expect the central bank to start
tightening policy until much later this year, however,
highlighting the dilemma facing policymakers of how to tackle
rising price pressures without derailing the economic recovery.
 ""Our forecast is for August, but I think there's wiggle room
in both directions, and May is looking increasingly likely,""
said Alan Clarke, economist at BNP Paribas.
 Inflation at the end of last year already exceeded the BoE's
November Inflation Report forecasts, averaging 3.4 percent, and
Governor King warned in January that surging oil and commodity
prices could drive CPI up to almost 5 percent.
 The BoE produces two forecasts for inflation -- one based on
market interest rate expectations and one that assumes interest
rates remain at 0.5 percent. 
 Analysts reckon that near-term inflation forecasts on both
measures will be revised upwards to reflect a greater knock-on
impact of rising commodity prices and value-added tax.
 The November forecasts envisaged inflation falling to a
modal 1.45 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on market
rate expectations, and 1.59 percent based on unchanged policy.
 ""For the first time in a while, assessing what happens to
monetary policy will depend on both fan charts,"" Clarke said.
 
 GROWTH RISKS
 The BoE's outlook for growth will also play a key role in
determining when policymakers start to withdraw monetary
stimulus, and so far it has maintained there is enough slack in
the economy to keep inflation in check further down the line.
 The central bank will almost certainly have to revise down
its near-term forecasts for GDP from November because of the
shock 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter decline in economic output
in the final three months of 2010.
 The contraction was mainly due to heavy snowfall in
December, and there are signs that activity rebounded quickly in
January. 
 But the BoE may still have to lower its medium term outlook
for growth, lessening the urgency for the Monetary Policy
Committee to take action on inflation. 
 The Bank's modal projection for year-on-year GDP growth in
Q4 2010 was 3.05 percent -- almost double a first official
estimate of 1.7 percent growth.
 ""That said, most MPC members have clearly become more
worried about the damage to credibility that is being wrought by
the persistent overshooting of the inflation target,"" said Simon
Hayes, economist at Barclays Capital.
 ""In that case, the report will provide a vehicle to prepare
financial markets, firms and households for a rate hike,
probably within the next few months.""

 (Adds details and background, changes headline)
 By Souhail Karam
 RABAT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - China's Sinochem will immediately
raise the volume of its fertiliser imports from Moroccan
state-run phosphate producer OCP under a deal that could also
pave the way to joint investments, officials said.
 Under the agreement signed on Monday, OCP will more than
triple volume sales of diammonium phosphates (DAP) to the
Chinese company starting in 2011 to 500,000 tonnes a year,
Moroccan Foreign Trade Minister Abdellatif Mazouz said.
 ""This agreement covers the 2011-2014 period. The maximum
amount of fertilizers OCP had sold on an annual basis to
Sinochem was 150,000 tonnes,"" Mazouz told Reuters.
 Growing protein consumption in Asia and a surge in global
food prices is encouraging farmers to invest in fertiliser,
agrochemicals and farming machinery to increase yields, Baring
Global Agriculture Fund said last week.
 This trend is also encouraging chemical companies to secure
supplies of phosphates and pushing up prices.
 Morocco, the only North African country that has no oil or
gas of its own, sits on nearly half of global phosphate
reserves, including deposits in the disputed Western Sahara, and
accounts for around a third of global phosphate exports.
 The deal, replacing an existing agreement between the two
firms, was signed on the sidelines of a visit to Morocco by
Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming.
 The agreement ""reconfirms and prolongs a relationship that
has been going for 16 years"", the head of Sinochem's fertilizer
import department said.
 ""Before we have been buying between 50,000 tonnes and
100,000 tonnes of DAP from OCP,"" the Chinese executive said.
 Mazouz also said the OCP-Sinochem agreement would pave the
way for joint investment by the two firms. He did not elaborate.
 Exports of phosphate and its by-products generated 35.6
billion dirhams ($4.3 billion) in 2010 against 18.1 billion
dirhams the year before, generating alone more than half the net
increase in the country's exports last year.
 Official data shows that in 2010 OCP raised the volume of
its natural and chemical fertiliser exports by 52 percent to
3.47 million tonnes, while the average price per tonne rose 53
percent to 3,762 dirham, which is almost 50 percent below the
7,273 dirham peak recorded in 2008.
 For phosphoric acid, the volume of OCP's exports rose 23
percent to 2.34 million tonnes while the average price rose 37.4
percent to 5,794 dirhams, also below a 2008 peak of 14,0013
dirhams.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week low
against the dollar on Monday as uncertainty over the plight of
troubled German bank WestLB and euro zone debt concerns kept
investors on edge.
 Aid for WestLB hangs in the balance, a source told Reuters
on Monday, as the bank struggles to come up with a rescue deal
ahead of presenting a restructuring plan to the European
Commission.
 ""Failure to find a find a solution for West LB would result
a winding down of the bank's assets,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
""The story revived concerns about Europe's banking sector and
highlighted the still unresolved issues plaguing the bloc's
indebted peripheral nations.""
 The euro slipped 0.7 percent to $1.3452 with selling coming
largely from eastern Europe in the aftermath of the WestLB
news.
 The move triggered stop-losses on the break of $1.3500,
taking the euro below support at $1.3483, the 38.2 percent
retracement of its rally from January to February. Stops in the

 Greg Anderson, G10 strategist at CitiFX in New York, said

 President Barack Obama's 2012 budget plan would slash the
U.S. deficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years, officials said on
Sunday, but Republicans were unimpressed and vowed to push for
deeper cuts in spending.
 CitiFX's Anderson said the proposal did not sway the dollar
and markets await clarity with what happens with negotiations
with Republicans in Congress.
 Selling in the euro helped to boost the dollar broadly on
the day, pushing it up around 0.34 percent on the day against a

average for the first time in four weeks.
 The dollar was nearly unchanged at 83.40 yen .

economy at the end of 2010, and a slight monthly fall in euro
zone industrial production in December kept euro sentiment
sluggish, although the separate figures were largely in line
with forecasts.
 Spanish bond auctions will be a focus for euro zone
investors on Thursday, while investors await details of a
European debt rescue fund next month.
 ""Concerns about a European debt rescue plan will remain in
place until March, and that is definitely a risk for the euro,
particularly when you consider the peak redemption for
Portuguese and Spanish bond redemptions in Q1,"" said Sven
Schubert, currency strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 Benchmark government debt yields in Portugal have climbed
around all-time highs above 7 percent, which market
participants consider to be dangerously high in a country many
believe may be forced to appeal for a bailout.
 DATA FLURRY
 This week ushers in a flurry of data, with euro zone fourth
quarter GDP due for the euro area Tuesday, when the United
States releases New York manufacturing data and retail sales.
 With global inflation a hot topic, a number of countries
will release consumer price index data this week, including the
Britain, the United States, Sweden and Canada.
 ""While the market will undoubtedly trade around these data
points, there will likely be bigger interest in how central
banks frame future policy moves,"" Anderson said. ""The BoE (Bank
of England) gets its chance to do so with the quarterly
inflation report that will be released on Wednesday, which is
the same day that minutes from the last (Fed's monetary policy
board) FOMC meeting will be released.""
 The focus later this week will a G20 finance officials
meetings on Friday and Saturday.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed
towards last week's 30-month high on Monday as talk of
slower-than-expected Chinese inflation eased fears of more
policy tightening, while the euro fell on renewed worries about
Europe's banking sector.
 U.S. crude oil  erased early losses to stand near $86
a barrel after hitting a 10-week low last week. Gold 
prices rose on safe-haven demand amid fears that Egypt's unrest
would spread across the Arab world.
 The euro  fell to a three-week low of $1.3428 on
trading platform EBS on concerns surrounding the fate of German
lender WestLB. It last traded down 0.6 percent at $1.3459.
 German financial regulator BaFin is involved in talks
about the restructuring of WestLB as the bank struggles to come
up with a rescue deal, sources told Reuters. [ID:nBAT005995]
 ""The story highlighted the shaky state of Europe's banks,
which were hit hard by the global credit crisis, bursting real
estate bubbles and a sovereign debt crisis,"" said Omer Esiner,
chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in
Washington.
 Weakness in the euro helped pushed the U.S. dollar index,
which measures the greenback versus a basket of major
currencies, to a three-week high of 78.873 <.DXY>,.
 Financial markets showed little reaction to President
Barack Obama's budget proposal to cut the U.S. deficit by $1.1

 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.3

 European finance ministers will discuss on Monday how to
give their euro zone rescue fund more flexibility and firepower
and how to tackle debt crises after 2013, but final decisions
are unlikely before March. [ID:nLDE71C0BT]
 CHINESE DATA
 Traders said that China's consumer prices may have risen as
little as 4.9 percent in the year to January, the lowest of 26
forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of a
5.3 percent rise. The official data will be announced on
Tuesday.  [ID:nTOE71D01T]
 This eased concerns that China's central bank would have to
raise interest rates aggressively, which could slow down
growth.
 Optimism about the Chinese economic outlook also grew after
data showed the country's trade surplus fell to its lowest in
nine months in January when imports surged, underscoring robust
domestic demand. Solid export growth also hinted at
solidifying recoveries in the U.S. and European economies.
 ""The talk of the Chinese inflation data and the export and
import data is going to boost the market,"" Heino Ruland,
strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt said.
 ""Inflation has been the major worry and there has been a
fear of monetary overkill, but until the data is released (on

 LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - French hopes for tough curbs on
commodities speculation to tame soaring food prices look set to
be thwarted as leading producer nations line up to oppose market
interference.
 France is president of the Group of 20 leading developed and
developing economies this year. The group's finance ministers
meet in Paris on Friday and Saturday with commodities high on
the agenda.
 But as with an earlier French-backed push for a global tax
on financial transactions, there is no consensus for radical
measures beyond more reporting requirements for traders.
 Faced with opposition from key quarters, France sought on
Monday to downplay expectations, Economy Minister Christine
Lagarde saying France had no desire to regulate raw material
prices.
 ""What we would like to do, on the other hand, is try to
reduce volatility by simply shining a light on market
fundamentals,"" she told a news conference.
 That marked a softening of tone from French President
Nicholas Sarkozy who said last month that ""if it is not
regulated it is a free for all, it is the jungle law"".
 Soaring prices are certainly causing pain. The World Bank
said last week it expected volatile, higher than average grain
prices until at least 2015 with nearly a billion people
worldwide hungry already.
 G20 sources said there is a split between major producers of
commodities who oppose draconian market curbs, and the big
consumers of commodities who want greater control of prices.
 The United States, Brazil and Canada, all major producers of
foods, metals and other commodities, have made a point in recent
days of publicly opposing the French push.
 Such countries fear that interfering with commodities prices
will send misleading signals that could hamper investment to end
extraction and cause production bottlenecks.
 It was U.S. and Canadian opposition to a global transaction
or ""Tobin Tax"" that sank the idea as a G20 policy.
 ""We have more fundamental issues to address than perhaps
some degree of speculation in markets,"" Canada's Finance
Minister Jim Flaherty said recently.
 ""I hope we don't get sidetracked on issues that are not
central to the world economic recovery,"" he said.
 Lael Brainard, a U.S. Treasury undersecretary who
accompanied Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on a one-day
trip to Brazil this month, said Brazil and the United States
shared common ground on the G20 commodities agenda and wanted to
keep the focus on improving market functioning.
 
 FUNDAMENTALS VS SPECULATION
 Sarkozy has floated numerous proposals including limiting
positions investors can take, tagging which trades are
""speculative"" or ""commercial"" and regulating off-exchange
trading.
 A twin-track approach is emerging with G20 finance ministers
discussing curbs such as position limits on futures markets
while farm ministers are looking at better exchange of
information on agricultural products, as is happening in oil.
 G20 officials say it will be hard to agree tough measures
like position limits without consensus on whether speculation
rather than supply and demand factors sent food prices to record
highs and triggered street protests, including the downfall of
the ruling regime in Tunisia.
 ""Without a clear diagnosis it is difficult to talk about
remedies,"" Bank of Canada Deputy Governor John Murray said last
week.
 Officials at the Paris-based OECD club of rich nations, said
an in-depth analysis of agricultural commodities markets showed
both fundamental and speculative factors driving markets.
 ""Fundamentals are surely strong drivers of commodities
prices. Speculation is there also, but we cannot say how big is
the role of speculation,"" OECD Chief Economist Pier Carlo Padoan
said.
 ""The lack of knowledge on this issue causes debate among G20
on what should be done to regulate markets,"" he said.
 Other G20 sources said this week's meeting was likely to
agree on face-saving measures such as a mandate for a working
group to analyse why commodities markets are so volatile.
 ""Analysing commodities trading doesn't necessarily have
significant policy implications,"" a finance ministry official
from a major G20 country said.
 The G20's regulatory task force, the Financial Stability
Board, and other regulators like the International Organisation
for Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are already looking at the
relationship between physical and futures markets in
commodities.
 Regulators are already focusing on better trade transparency
in off-exchange markets but feel there is some way to go
regarding physical markets and in how to aggregate data from all
types of markets to spot underlying trends in trading.
 The United States is already introducing position limits in
some of its own commodities markets and the European Union is
looking to give supervisors powers to intervene with trading
curbs when needed.

 * EUR/USD breaks below key technical support
 * U.S. deficit reduction plans unlikely to boost dollar

 (Adds comment, detail, updates prices)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro slipped to a three-week
low against the dollar on Monday, hit by reports that rescue
plans for ailing lender WestLB were under threat, and with euro
zone peripheral debt concerns keeping investors on edge.
 Aid for WestLB hangs in the balance, a source told Reuters
on Monday, as the bank struggles to come up with a rescue deal
ahead of presenting a restructuring plan to the European
Commission.
 ""The WestLB news doesn't provide a great deal of optimism to
the euro at the start of the week,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
currency strategist at CIBC.
 ""Structural negatives in the euro zone haven't gone away,
and some of those risks are due to the banking sector. WestLB's
problems are a reflection of that.""
 The euro slipped to $1.3447 with selling coming largely from
eastern-Europe in the aftermath of the news, hitting its weakest
since late January. 
 The move triggered stop-losses on the break of $1.3500,
taking the euro below support at $1.3483, the 38.2 percent
retracement of its rally from January to February. It was also
trading back below its 100-day moving average which comes in at
$1.3541.
 A 0.3 percent quarterly contraction in the Portuguese
economy at the end of 2010, and a slight monthly fall in euro
zone industrial production in December kept euro sentiment
sluggish, although the separate figures were largely in line
with forecasts.
 Spanish bond auctions will be a focus for euro zone
investors on Thursday, while investors await details of a
European debt rescue fund next month.
""Concerns about a European debt rescue plan will remain in
place until March, and that is definitely a risk for the euro,
particularly when you consider the peak redemption for
Portuguese and Spanish bond redemptions in Q1,"" said Sven

 Benchmark government debt yields in Portugal have climbed
around all-time highs above 7 percent, which market participants
consider to be dangerously high in a country many believe may be
forced to appeal for a bailout.
 
 U.S. DEFICIT REDUCTION
 President Barack Obama proposed a budget on Monday that
would cut the U.S. deficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years,
setting the stage for a bitter fight with Republicans who vow
even tougher spending controls.
 Two thirds of Obama's deficit savings come from spending
cuts and expected reductions in interest payments as the deficit
declines. The rest comes from higher revenue, in part as
provisions in a December pact on payroll taxes and jobless aid
expire, and also as stronger growth lifts tax revenue.
 ""These plans are based on expectations for strong growth in
the U.S., but if unemployment stays high, the only way to get
consumption growth is through credit. I don't see anything in
these plans that will make the dollar a hot currency,"" said
Stephen Gallo, Head of Market Analysis at Schneider Foreign
Exchange. 
 Selling in the euro helped to boost the dollar broadly on
the day, pushing it up around 0.4 percent on the day against a
currency basket to 78.781, trading above its 100-day moving
average for the first time in four weeks.
 It was flat at 83.35 yen, recovering earlier losses suffered
on selling by Japanese exporters.

 By Daniel Flynn and Leigh Thomas
 PARIS, Feb 14 (Reuters) - France played down hopes on Monday
of getting G20 finance ministers to agree this week on how to
deal with global economic imbalances, although it said that
remained its goal.
 The divide over which indicators should be used to measure
imbalances -- a starting point for dictating what needs to be
done to make the world economy work better -- is the latest sign
of renewed discord in the group of leading powers, whose latest
meeting begins in Paris on Friday.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy has had to scale down his
ambitions to revamp the international monetary system during a
year-long stewardship of the G20, instead focusing on targeted
reforms like the list of indicators and commodity regulation.
 But even those generate strong differences, only two years
after the group found consensus on a grand plan intended to deal
with the financial crisis and prevent repeats.
""We hope ... to reach agreements (this week) on economic
performance indicators which will allow us to measure the way
towards the optimal point,"" Economy Minister Christine Lagarde
told a news conference.
 ""Our hope is to reach agreement on indicators as soon as
next Saturday. If we do not, it is not a drama.""
 A summit in Seoul last year mandated France to reach
agreement in the first half of 2011 on a list of ""indicative
guidelines"" for quantifying imbalances -- the most obvious of
which include China's huge trade surplus and Germany's dominance
of its European peers on exports.
 
 BEIJING ISSUES
 Disagreement has persisted between rich and developing
nations over which indicators to select, with G20 officials
saying China in particular is resisting pressure from developed
nations to include factors like real effective exchange rates
and the level of foreign assets.
 ""We doubt you can determine which countries have a dangerous
macroeconomic policy based on a set of indicators. Rather, you
need a complex analysis of the situation in any given country,""
said Russian Deputy Finance Minister Dmitry Pankin.
 ""We expect the biggest clashes (at this week's G20 summit)
about the indicators,"" he added, noting that Australia, Germany
and the BRIC countries were lukewarm about the proposal.
 Lagarde told the Financial Times in an interview published
on Monday that ""a combination of political posture and
positioning"" was making progress difficult only days away from
meetings on Friday and Saturday.
 She said that while there was a basic understanding that any
indicators should measure commercial imbalances, there was ""a
long debate on whether to include the trade balance with its
flows of products and whether to include flows of services"".
 G20 officials say that China would prefer to be assessed on
its trade account, which it has pledged to gradually reduce as
it boosts domestic demand, rather than on its current account.
 The current account would include interest payments on
China's nearly $3 trillion in reserves which reflect its
accumulated past trade surpluses.
 Data on Monday showed China's trade surplus fell to its
lowest in nine months in January after imports surged,
supporting the government's case ahead of the G20 meeting that
it is doing enough to spur domestic demand without speeding up
currency appreciation.
 
 NOT SEEKING COMMODITIES CONTROLS
 European Union members of the G20 want the list to include
current account balances, public deficit and debt, private debt,
savings ratios, net foreign asset positions, reserve adequacy
and real effective exchange rates, according to an EU document
obtained by Reuters. 
 Lagarde said that if the meeting this week could seal
agreement on the list of indicators, then deciding numeric
limits on them would be ""the next stage"". Ministers from the
group meet again in Washington in April.
 Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer, who will host his
fellow G20 central bankers this week, said the debate on
imbalances was not intended to be a finger-pointing exercise at
countries with large deficits or surpluses.
 ""The exercise consists of looking for the structural
weaknesses of each of the 20 countries to see how they can be
reduced,"" he said at the same event as Lagarde, citing the
examples of savings and investment.
 France has also made seeking agreement on tougher regulation
to curb volatility in food and fuel prices a priority. 
 But here too it faces a deep split between major producers
of commodities who oppose strict market curbs, and the big
consumers of commodities who want greater control of prices.
 Lagarde tried to assuage what she said were concerns voiced
by large emerging economies such as Brazil. ""We do not want to
propose that prices are administered, not at all,"" she said.
 As part of Sarkozy's aim of reshaping the financial system,
Paris is also pushing for the inclusion of China's yuan in the
basket of currencies underpinning the IMF's Special Drawing
Rights -- part of a shift towards what Sarkozy dubs a
""multipolar"" world.
 Lagarde stressed, however, that China would have to meet
conditions on the convertibility of the yuan and liberalise its
current account for its currency to be included in the SDR.
 An Indian treasury official said last week that India will
oppose the yuan being included in the SDR basket as that would
give China unfair economic clout compared with India.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2011 06:48AM ET</span>",PROFILE-Sweden's finance minister Anders Borg," Position: Finance Minister
 Incumbent: Anders Borg, 42
 Term: 2010 to September 2014. Borg was reappointed as the
Nordic country's finance minister in early October after the
Moderate Party-led government beat the centre-left opposition in
a Sept. 19 general election, though it lost its house majority
due to gains for the far-right.

 Key Facts:
 -- Borg is the closest ally of Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt and helped remodel the Moderate party after its
previous period in power in the early 1990s when Sweden suffered
a deep economic crisis.
 The two have moved the Moderates closer to the political
centre and toned down plans for radical cuts in taxes and the
welfare state.
 -- Under Borg's watch as finance minister, the government
has trimmed income taxes, abolished a wealth tax and introduced
greater incentives to get people back to work. The government
also embarked on Sweden's biggest-ever privatisation programme,
which included the sale of Absolut Vodka maker Vin & Sprit, real
estate firm Vasakronan and part of TeliaSonera.
 -- Borg, who sports a pony-tail and earring, was a surprise
choice as finance minister in 2006. He held onto his role after
admitting shortly after the elections that he had failed to
declare payments to a nanny his family used. Two other cabinet
members resigned over similar admissions.
 -- Borg gained recognition in Europe for his outspoken views
on regulation of the financial industry, especially of bank
bonuses. He was widely quoted during the global recession as
saying ""the bankers are partying like it's 1999, and it's 2009"".
 -- At home, Borg has been praised for introducing timely
fiscal measures to ease the effects of the downturn without
jeopardising public finances that are among the strongest in the
European Union.
 -- As most of Europe struggles with deep deficits and
austerity measures, Sweden anticipates a return to a budget
surplus already in 2012. 
 -- Borg studied economics at Stockholm University and has
worked as adviser to the country's central bank. In the private
sector, he headed the economics department at Swedish bank SEB
and served as chief economist for ABN AMRO in Stockholm.
 -- Borg has said the government would soon resume its
privatisation campaign but because it does not have a majority
in parliament following the election, it may not be strong
enough to push asset sales past a reluctant parliament.
 -- The four-party ruling coalition wants to sell 100 billion
crowns ($14 billion) in state assets over the next four years to
help reduce state debt.

 Incumbent: Stefan Ingves, 57
 Term: Ingves' term of office is six years from January 1,
2006.
 
 Key Facts:
 -- Ingves is governor of the world's oldest central bank. He
is also a member of the ECB General Council and a member of the
Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements.
 -- The central bank chief holds a PhD in economics and has
previously been director at the International Monetary Fund and
deputy governor of the Riksbank. Prior to that, he was
under-secretary and head of the financial markets department at
the Finance Ministry.
 -- The central bank slashed rates to historic lows during
the global financial crisis which began in 2008, but given
Sweden's sharp recovery since raising rates in July. The latest
rise, the fourth in a row, was on December 15 to 1.25 percent
from 1.0 percent.
 -- Ingves has flagged potential problems due to European
debt problems but believes that a robust recovery at home meant
that rates needed to rise.
 -- He has said that the interest rate would be close to more
""normal levels"" of four percent in three years.
 -- Ingves, an avid long-distance runner, holds regular
online chats with the public to discuss rate decisions and
explain central bank policy. When asked if the Riksbank's two
percent inflation target could be changed in the near future, he
replied: ""No!""
 -- The Riksbank sees the economy growing 4.4 percent in 2011
after an expected 5.5 percent rise in 2010. Some analysts have
questioned whether the central bank is not too optimistic about
growth next year, given problems in Europe.
 -- Ingves has a reputation for being unbiased, level-headed
and not easily ruffled. Colleagues say he has an enormous work
capacity and a deeply analytical mind although some in the media
say he has been less outspoken than his predecessors.
 -- Ingves admitted last year Sweden should have had in place
a much a stronger regulatory framework to deal with potential
losses by Swedish banks due to exposure in the recession-hit
Baltics.

 Incumbent: Fredrik Reinfeldt, 45
 Term: 2010-2014. Reinfeldt's centre-right government soundly
beat the centre-left opposition in a Sept. 19 general election
but lost its parliament majority after the anti-immigration
Sweden Democrats won their first seats.
 
 Key Facts:
 -- Reinfeldt swept to power in 2006 on a promise to fine
tune, not dismantle, the Swedish welfare state by cutting taxes
and providing more incentives for people to return to work. His
four-party coalition is made up of the Moderate Party, the
Liberal Party, the Christian Democrats and the Centre Party.
 -- In September 2010, Reinfeldt became Sweden's first
sitting centre-right prime minister to win re-election after
campaigning on promises to trim income taxes further. His
coalition also hopes to cut value-added tax on restaurant meals
and spend more on healthcare and education.
 -- Reinfeldt and his centre-right allies won 173 seats in
the 349-seat parliament, two short of a majority. His coalition
government plans to remain a minority administration after the
opposition Green Party refused to back the coalition.
 -- Reinfeldt, whose personal popularity far exceeds that of
his main rival -- Social Democrat leader Mona Sahlin -- came to
power as one of the country's youngest prime ministers and
stepped up his presence on the international stage during
Sweden's six-month European Union presidency in 2009.
 -- He is a family man who is known for his calm, controlled
approach to leadership which observers say sets him apart from
some of his predecessors in the centre-right bloc.
 -- Analysts had said re-election for the centre-right
government would show Swedes were prepared to inch further away
from the traditional ""Swedish Model"" of a cradle-to-grave
welfare state to one with a heavier dose of capitalism.
 -- Reinfeldt has long wanted to make it more profitable for
lower and middle-income earners to work and reduce unemployment
benefits to boost incentives to take work.
 -- However, even though the Moderate-led government has cut
taxes and trimmed the welfare state to try and boost jobs, the
jobless rate stands above 7.0 percent -- higher than when
Reinfeldt came to power. The opposition says that his policies
simply punish the sick and unemployed and benefit the rich.
 -- Reinfeldt has said he wants Sweden more involved in the
EU, but the country's main political parties have all but ruled
out a new referendum on the euro currency during the next four
years. Swedes rejected adopting the common currency in 2003.
 -- Reinfeldt's alliance wants to sell 100 billion Swedish
crowns ($14.2 billion) of state-owned shares over four years.
That is likely to include stakes in Nordea, the region's biggest
bank, telecoms firm TeliaSonera and mortgage lender SBAB.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro slipped to a three-week
low against the dollar on Monday, stung by reports that
Germany's financial watchdog has become involved in a rescue of
ailing lender WestLB.
 Aid for WestLB hangs in the balance, a source told Reuters
on Monday, as the bank struggles to come up with a rescue deal
as it enters the final stretch to present a restructuring plan
to the European Commission.
 ""The WestLB news doesn't provide a great deal of optimism to
the euro at the start of the week,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
currency strategist at CIBC.
 ""Structural negatives in the euro zone haven't gone away,
and some of those risks are due to the banking sector. WestLB's
problems are a reflection of that.""
 The euro slipped to around $1.3450 in the aftermath of the
news, hitting its weakest since late January. The move dragged
the single currency off the day's high around $1.3560 and below
support around $1.3540, its 100-day moving average.
 A 0.3 percent quarterly contraction in the Portuguese
economy at the end of 2010, and a slight monthly fall in euro
zone industrial production in December kept euro sentiment
sluggish, although the separate figures were largely in line
with forecasts.
 
 DOLLAR SUPPORTED
 Asian sovereign names were seen pushing the single European
currency lower in early European trade, after demand from the
region had boosted the euro earlier in the day.
 Selling in the euro helped to boost the dollar broadly,
pushing it up around 0.4 percent on the day against a currency
basket to 78.765, its highest in three weeks.
 It was flat versus the yen around 83.40 yen, recovering
earlier losses suffered on earlier selling by Japanese
exporters.
 The euro's reaction to WestLB's latest woes underline the
single currency's vulnerability to any signs of weakness in the
euro zone banking sector as some countries struggle to deal with
staggering debts.
 Debt issues will remain in focus as Spain and Italy hold
debt auctions this week, while investors await details of a
European debt rescue fund next month.
""Concerns about a European debt rescue plan will remain in
place until March, and that is definitely a risk for the euro,
particularly when you consider the peak redemption for
Portuguese and Spanish bond redemptions in Q1,"" said Sven
Schubert, currency strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 Benchmark government debt yields in Portugal have climbed
around all-time highs above 7 percent, which market participants
consider to be dangerously high in a country many believe may be
forced to appeal for a bailout.
 As the euro struggles, upbeat U.S. data has helped shore up
the dollar in past weeks, and some analysts said more signs of
an improving U.S. economy may boost the dollar even as the
Federal Reserve is determined to keep rates chained near zero.
 A raft of U.S. data is due this week, including figures on
retail sales and consumer confidence, and with the latest CFTC
positioning data showing growing bets for dollar losses, some
analysts say strong data may trigger more dollar short covering.

 ""Non-commercial investors are now net long all currencies
covered in the IMM report against the dollar. Hence, a positive
USD shock certainly has the potential to be amplified by
position unwinding,"" Danske analysts said in a note.

 LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro slipped to a three-week
low against the dollar on Monday, stung by reports that
Germany's financial watchdog has become involved in a rescue of

 By 0916 GMT, the euro had slipped to $1.3461 according to
electronic trading platform EBS, its weakest since late January,
after breaking below support around $1.3540, the single
currency's 100-day moving average.
 The WestLB news helped to pull the single currency away from
a session high around $1.3560, and traders said losses
accelerated after stop-loss orders were triggered around
$1.3490.
 Asian sovereign names were seen pushing the single European
currency lower in early European trade, after demand from the
region had boosted the euro earlier in the day.
 Asian demand has been a constant support for the euro and
other currencies as many countries in the region have been
selling their own currencies against the dollar to keep them
weak, before dumping those dollars for other currencies.
 
 DEBT ISSUES
 Selling in the euro helped to boost the dollar broadly,
pushing it up around 0.3 percent on the day against a currency
basket to 78.712, its highest in three weeks.
 Versus the yen, the greenback slipped 0.3 percent to 83.16
yen as Japanese exporters took advantage of its rise last week
to a three-week high of 83.68 yen.

 * Philippines 2011 rice imports below 1 mln T	
 * Thai exporters hope to secure deals with Manila	
 * Indonesia buys 400,000 T rice from Vietnam	

(Adds Indonesia's purchase of Vietnamese rice)
 By Ho Binh Minh and Erik dela Cruz	
 HANOI/MANILA, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Higher-than-expected rice
exports from Vietnam in the first quarter and a plan by the
Philippines to import less of the grain could trigger a drop in
Asian prices in coming weeks.	
 Ample supplies from Thailand and Vietnam, the world's
biggest rice exporters, smaller imports by top importer the
Philippines, as well as Indonesia's aim to fill additional
stockpiles via domestic production, could help ease fears over
dramatic price surges and food inflation in the region.	
 ""In the first six months, rice prices in Vietnam are often
determined by the Philippines, and prices are set to fall on its
lower import plan and Vietnam's major harvest,"" a trader in Ho
Chi Minh City said.	
 Vietnam's first-quarter rice shipments are slated to reach
between 1.6 million and 1.8 million tonnes, up at least 11
percent from a year ago, a state-run newspaper
said. 
 Vietnam also began cutting prices on Monday to attract
import demand, down by between 3 and 4 percent the minimum
prices required for its export grades. 
 The Philippines will import less than 1 million tonnes of
rice this year, mostly via the private sector, and is likely to
start within the first quarter, the head of the state grains
agency said. 
 ""They (private traders) have to bring it in by June 30 in
order to ensure that we have enough stock during the lean
season,"" National Food Authority administrator Angelito Banayo
said.	
 Hefty stockpiles and early rains that are expected to boost
harvest this year, have given the Philippines room to cut
imports after the country bought a record of 2.45 million tonnes
in 2010.	
 Manila's lower rice purchases may help cool food inflation
that has worried policymakers and triggered rate hikes around
the region.	
 
 The Philippine plan did not surprise traders in Bangkok, who
said the market had factored in possibilities that Manila would
buy less rice after its record purchase last year.	
 ""The amount of less than 1 million tonnes is a bit
unreasonable. The Philippines may want to cool down prices which
have been pushed up by fresh demand from Indonesia during early
of this month,"" said a Bangkok-based trader.	
 He added that the Philippines could import more if the first
plan approved on Monday did not cover domestic demand.	
 However, a trading manager with an international trading
firm in Singapore said: ""They (the Philippines) have had a very
good crop, so we don't expect them to buy as much as they did
last year.	
 ""We reckon their imports in 2011 will be between 1.0 and 1.5
million tonnes. They will enter the market at the end of March
when Vietnam is flushed with rice and don't have much capacity
to hold stocks.""	
 
 INDONESIA BUYS VIETNAM RICE	
 Indonesia has bought 400,000 tonnes of 15 percent broken
rice from Vietnam for shipment from March after Thai exporters
could not meet their loading requirements, traders said.

 Initially, Indonesia aimed to secure 820,000 tonnes of rice
from Thailand, Vietnamese traders in Ho Chi Minh City said. Now,
Vietnamese grain would make up nearly half that quantity.	
 One trader said Indonesia may have secured the grain at $470
a tonne, while the delivery terms at that price were not clear.	
 ""Prices in Vietnam will still soften despite this deal
because a major harvest is under way,"" one trader said.	
 Sutarto Alimoeso, president director of Indonesia's state
procurement agency Bulog said, it aims to lift rice stocks to 2
million tonnes by end-year via domestic procurement because of
expected higher rice production. 
 ""Indonesia is a very cautious player. Our estimate is that
they will still need some 500,000 tonnes from the international
market in the coming months,"" the trading manager in Singapore
said.	
 Out of Vietnam's rice exports in the first quarter, 700,000
tonnes could be loaded this month. Shipments in March would
reach between 400,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes, after 485,000
tonnes had gone last month, the Agriculture Ministry-run Vietnam
Agriculture newspaper said (danviet.vn).	
 Vietnam exported 1.44 million tonnes of rice in the first
quarter of 2010, government data show.	
 
 PRICES UP NOW, FALL IN MARCH	
 But the market expected less rice to be loaded.	
 ""Vietnam could load 1.0 million tonnes to 1.2 million tonnes
and will have around 2.0 million tonnes in surplus,"" the trader
in Ho Chi Minh City said.	
 The winter-spring rice crop, Vietnam's largest crop and the
harvest of which is to peak in two weeks, is expected to produce
3.5 million tonnes of milled rice for export, he said, citing
industry crop data.	
 Vietnam Food Association has sought government permit to
build a stockpile of 1.0 million tonnes of milled rice from
March 1 to prevent price falls, industry officials said last
week.	
 Loading for Indonesia under a deal signed in late 2010, plus
the industry's plan to stock pile rice, had pushed domestic
prices up slightly this week, traders in Vietnam said. Prices
rose 300 dong in recent days to 5,500 dong (26.3 U.S. cents) per
kg of paddy in the Mekong Delta province of Long An on Sunday.	
 
 THAILAND VERSUS VIETNAM 
 Some traders said Vietnam may lose rice deals to Thai
exporters unless it changes its policy preventing exporters from
selling 25 percent broken rice to private firms, especially
after Manila decided that private traders should import most its
demand for the year to help contain government costs.

 ""Now the policy has been in place as Vietnam has hopes for a
large government deal with the Philippines, so with the new
development on Monday (in Manila) Vietnam cannot compete,"" a
second trader in Vietnam said.	
 Manila's plan could bring an opportunity for Thai exporters,
a senior Thai rice industry official said.	
 ""This could mean that we could share some parts of the less
than 1 million tonnes that the Philippines wanted to buy as the
import will be done by private importers,"" said Chookiat
Ophaswongse, the honorary president of the Thai Rice Exporters
Association.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - World stocks inched towards last
week's 30-month high on Monday as China's shrinking trade
surplus underscored its robust domestic demand and talk of
slower-than-expected inflation eased policy tightening concerns.
 China's trade surplus fell to its lowest in nine months in
January when imports surged, highlighting China's massive
appetite for raw materials. Solid export growth also hinted at
solidifying recoveries in the U.S. and European economies.
 Traders said that China's consumer prices may have risen as
little as 4.9 percent in the year to January, the lowest of 26
forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of a
5.3 percent rise. The official data will be announced on
Tuesday.
 This eased concerns that China's central bank would have to
raise interest rates aggressively.
 ""The talk of the Chinese inflation data and the export and
import data is going to boost the market,"" Heino Ruland,
strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt said.
 ""Inflation has been the major worry and there has been a
fear of monetary overkill, but until the data is released (on
Tuesday) we could see a bit of volatility in the market.""
 The MSCI world equity index rose 0.2 percent, having hit its
highest level since August 2008 last week.
 Thomson Reuters' global stock index gained 0.3 percent. U.S.
stock futures were down around 0.1 percent, pointing to a weaker
open on Wall Street.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.2 percent to hit a
29-month peak.
 Emerging stocks added 1.1 percent. Shanghai stocks hit an
eight-week high, scoring the index's biggest single-day
percentage gain since mid-December.
 U.S. crude oil erased early losses to stand steady at $85.53
a barrel after hitting a 10-week low last week.
 
 YIELD SUPPORT FOR DOLLAR
 The euro fell to a three-week low of $1.3450 on concerns
surrounding the fate of German lender WestLB.
 Sources told Reuters German financial regulator BaFin is
being involved in the WestLB restructuring talks as the bank
struggles to come up with a rescue deal.
 ""The WestLB news doesn't provide a great deal of optimism to
the euro at the start of the week,"" said Jeremy Stretch,
currency strategist at CIBC.
 ""Structural negatives in the euro zone haven't gone away,
and some of those risks are due to the banking sector. WestLB's
problems are a reflection of that.""
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 There was no immediate reaction from President Barack
Obama's budget proposal to cut the U.S. deficit by $1.1 trillion
over 10 years.
 The dollar has been supported by rising U.S. yields, which
hit their highest in nearly 10 months last week.
 ""As long as U.S. yields hold current high levels it is hard
to oppose dollar gains,"" Lloyds TSB said in a note to clients.
 ""But it is questionable how sustainable the current level of
U.S. yields is with a dovish (Federal Reserve) stance, and the
dollar typically struggles to find much traction in a 'risk on'
world.""
 German government bond futures were steady on the day.
 European finance ministers will discuss on Monday how to
give their euro zone rescue fund more flexibility and firepower
and how to tackle debt crises after 2013, but final decisions
are unlikely before March.

 TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The value of investment trust funds
targeting Japanese retail investors rose to a nine-month high of
$772 billion in January on robust money flows into fund of funds
schemes an industry body said on Monday.
 The investment trust fund, or toushin, market has seen net
inflows for 22 consecutive months as retail investors seek higher
returns and look to diversify their portfolios into financial
products from low-yielding bank and postal deposits.
 The toushin market is closely watched due to its hefty size,
which almost matches the economy of the Netherlands at $792
billion.
 Net inflows from retail investors climbed 16.4 percent to
624.6 billion yen ($7.5 billion) in January from the previous
month.
 Overall asset value rose 1.0 percent, or 655.3 billion yen,
to 64.4 trillion yen in January from the previous month, the
Investment Trusts Association of Japan said.
 ""Overall improvement in performance pushed up asset values
slightly. We've seen mixed reaction in global shares, with share
prices of industrial countries edging up, while prices in
developing countries slumped,"" Fumio Inui, the association's vice
president, told a news conference.
 The broader Topix index climbed 1.3 percent in January, while
the key Nikkei average inched up 0.1 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.7 percent during the
month.
 Inui said steady inflows into fund of funds schemes were a
key factor in lifting the size of investment trust funds in
general.
 The outstanding value of fund of funds schemes hit a record
high of 20.7 trillion yen in January.
 Retail investors poured broadly into stocks and bond funds
during the month, he said.

 By Jussi Rosendahl and Georgina Prodhan
 HELSINKI/BARCELONA, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Nokia's already
battered shares fell further on Monday as analysts slammed its
all-or-nothing Microsoft deal for being badly planned and
failing to answer questions on developing smartphones.
 New CEO Stephen Elop announced the software tie-up with
Microsoft on Friday, but the mainstay of his much-anticipated
strategy revamp failed to restore investor confidence in Nokia.
 Under the partnership, which Elop said was worth billions,
Nokia will adopt Windows Phone software across its devices,
replacing its home-grown Symbian platform and turning the
world's largest cellphone maker into a pure hardware player.
 Nomura analysts responded to Elop likening the plan to
leaping from a burning platform, by warning: ""It's a long way
down"" and said the fact that Nokia could not give a 2011 outlook
made the stock ""hard to own"" over the next 12 months.
 Nokia stock was down 4.1 percent at 6.715 euros by 1429 GMT
on a flurry of analyst downgrades. The shares are down 20
percent since the middle of last week when news of the deal
leaked, hitting a six-month low.
 ""The chief executive will suffer from a lack of credibility
among investors for a long time, fixing that will be a major
task,"" Swedbank analyst Jari Honko said.
 In some of the first reaction to the deal from competitors,
Research In Motion co-CEO Jim Balsillie said it did not change
the game, but conceded that the market was difficult.
 ""I wish them well in what they do and they're both very very
good companies, but our strategy is our strategy...It doesn't
change what we do,"" Balsillie said.
 ""We feel good about our future but it's never been more
turbulent, it's never been busier, it's never been more
demanding,"" the RIM co-CEO added.
 Some technology analysts said Nokia faced a short-term
collapse of consumer demand for its Symbian-based phones which
would eat into margins -- the phones currently make up around
half of Nokia's devices sales.
 Choosing a full swap out for Microsoft makes Nokia similar
to personal computer makers like Dell, whose shares are valued
at far lower multiples than smartphone companies.
 Before the Microsoft deal was confirmed Nokia shares traded
at 13.4 times expected 2011 earnings, below Apple's 19.3 times
but ahead of Dell's 9.2 times multiple. At Dell's valuation,
Nokia shares would be worth 5.61 euros.
 ""We expect Nokia's smartphone market share to collapse as
developers abandon Symbian support following Elop's dismissive
comments about Symbian and Qt software platforms,"" Tero
Kuittinen, analyst at MKM Partners, said.
 
 DEVELOPMENT DOUBTS
 Analysts were also concerned that Nokia had failed to answer
questions about the development of new smartphone models.
 ""I believe Nokia's smartphone sales will go down by some 20
percent for the rest of the year. They will lose a lot of market
share,"" said Nordea analyst Sami Sarkamies, adding that the
alliance could prove to be succesful in long term.
 Nokia has already lost major market share on high-margin
smartphones to Apple's iPhone and products based on Google Inc's
Android platform. 
 ""We have lowered our Nokia smart-phone forecasts for 2011 by
7 percent and we are concerned by both the lack of preparation
the industry/employees appear to have had,"" UBS analyst Gareth
Jenkins said.
Others pointed out that Microsoft's experience in the mobile
phone market did not bode well.
 ""Nokia is...handing responsibility for its user interface to
Microsoft, which has a poor track record in this area, and
giving access to its innovations to key rivals,"" said Stuart
Jeffrey at Nomura in a research note.
 Many analysts believe that smartphone makers such as Samsung
, HTC or Sony Ericsson will now embrace Google's Android more
deeply, fearing they can no longer compete with Nokia on Windows
Phone.
 ""Is Nokia forced to pay as much as we do? Apparently they
are not,"" Bert Nordberg, chief of Sony Ericsson, told Reuters in
an interview.
 Microsoft insisted its collaboration with Nokia would help
rival phone makers, not threaten them, according to the software
giant's president of mobile.
 Andy Lees told Reuters in Barcelona that the vote of
confidence from Nokia, which sold 100 million smartphones last
year, would encourage developers to create applications for
Windows Phone, aiding all cellphone makers using the platform.

 By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro teetered at a key
technical level against the dollar on Monday, with a break of
that support seen likely to deepen its decline as markets turn
cautious ahead of a slew of events this week.
 Among them, fund-raising by Italy and Spain in the bond
market will be closely watched, especially after Portuguese
government bond yields recently jumped to euro-era highs,
renewing worries about the funding costs of highly indebted euro
zone countries.
 The yen bounced back from a three-week low on buying by
Japanese companies, though traders say it looks increasingly
under pressure on charts.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent from late U.S. levels to
$1.3526, struggling to recover above its 100-day moving average
at $1.3542, although it managed to stay above a three-week low of
$1.3497 hit late last week.
 A break of $1.35, a level thats widely perceived to be
pivotal, could quickly see a test of $1.3483, which represents a
38.2 percent retracement of its Jan. 10-Feb. 2 rally.
 The euro was not hindered by lingering worries over the fate
of Egypt after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted.
 There is also uncertainty over who will lead the European
Central Bank after Bundesbank president Axel Weber -- who had
been seen as front-runner to succeed ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet -- suddenly decided to leave his central banking job.
 Still, many market players see the euro as likely to find
some support at $1.33 or above,
 ""The next level in the $1.33s will hold it. I can't see
anything between the U.S. and Europe which would drive it below
that at this point without some significant deterioration in
conditions in Europe,"" said Gregg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS.
 Some traders also said the euro is being helped by persistent
speculation of buying by Asian central banks.
 ""On one hand you have rising credit spreads in the euro zone,
but on the other hand many traders see some buying,"" said
Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and
Banking.
 With the euro on the back foot, the dollar was not far from
its highest level in three weeks against a basket of six major
currencies. The dollar index stood at 78.347, compared with the
high of 78.697 hit on Friday.
 Versus the yen, the greenback slipped 0.3 percent to 83.16
yen as Japanese exporters took advantage of its rise last week to
a three-week high of 83.68 yen.
 Upbeat U.S. data had helped shore up the dollar in the past
few sessions as investors covered short positions
 ""We're seeing a better trend for the dollar as U.S. economic
numbers are improving,"" said Gibbs at RBS. A raft of U.S. data is
due this week including retail sales and consumer prices.
 Also helping dollar/yen is the fact that the U.S. 10-year real
yield has reached 2.4 percent, the highest within the G10, while
Japan's real 10-year sovereign yield is a more modest 1.2
percent, BNP Paribas analysts said.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
speculators raised bets against the dollar to the highest level
since October for the week to Feb. 8, meaning there could be
scope for further dollar gains if markets cut short positions.
 Japanese investors may sell the dollar from coupon payments
on U.S. Treasuries on Feb. 15 and Japanese firms' repatriation
ahead of the financial year-end on March 31 could cap the dollar,
at least in Asian trade, traders say.
 But the dollar looks increasingly firm on charts, having
broken clearly above various moving averages, including its 21-
and 55-day averages, in the past few sessions, with the next
possible target seen at its December resistance around 84.50 yen.
 ""If the dollar/yen rate breaks above 84.50 yen, that would
change the whole sentiment of the market,"" a trader at a Japanese
bank said.
 Also closely watched this week is a batch of Chinese data
including inflation scheduled for release on Tuesday. Analysts
polled by Reuters expect inflation to have accelerated to 5.3
percent from 4.6 percent.
 A stronger-than-expected reading could fuel worries that
China will have to lift interest rates more aggressively,
raising the risk of slower growth.
 But talk that Chinese inflation may surprise on the downside
boosted Shanghai shares sharply, helping to lift the Australian
dollar 0.3 percent on the day to $1.0055,
 Still, the Australian dollar failed to extend gains on data
showing surprisingly strong growth in China's imports in January
-- which some market players took as an ominous sign that the
currency's bull run may be exhausted.

 The issue has been in the spotlight for months since it
became clear its effective capacity was only about 250 billion

 * Market talk of slower-than-expected Chinese inflation
 * Shanghai stocks lead Asian markets higher
(Updates prices)	
 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rallied on Monday,
snapping five straight sessions of losses, as talk of
slower-than-expected Chinese inflation helped drive Shanghai's
main share index to its best level in seven weeks.	
 European equity markets were expected to open higher, with
financial spreadbetters calling Britain's FTSE 100 up
0.2 percent, Germany's DAX up 0.3 percent and France's
CAC-40 up 0.5 percent. 
 Emerging Asia equity markets were among the best performers,
following a recent sell-off on worries about whether authorities
will be successful in tackling inflation.	
 ""Ultimately I think they will be successful, but we probably
won't know that until mid-year or second half of the year. In
the meantime markets will be worried about it periodically,""
said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors in Sydney.	
 ""Asian markets have had a sharp fall year-to-date. The good
news coming out of Egypt, which sparked a rally in the U.S. and
Europe has flowed through to Asia.""	
 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has handed power over to
the army, bowing to escalating pressure from the military and
protesters demanding he goes. His departure helped ease
geopolitical tensions and partially revived investors' appetite
for risk. 
 The Nikkei climbed 1.1 percent, while shares
elsewhere in Asia gained 1.7 percent, bouncing
off 2-1/2 month lows set last Friday. 

 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1.1 percent, Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index put on 1.1 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index advanced 2.2 percent.

 Traders said China's consumer price index may have risen 4.9
percent in the year to January, well below the consensus
forecast of 5.3 percent, a day ahead of the official release. 
 There was little reaction to data showing Japan's economy
shrank less than expected in the final quarter of last year.
Analysts expect a recovery this year on stronger exports to
China and other parts of fast-growing Asia. 
 Data on Monday showed China's imports rose 51 percent in
January, blowing past forecasts for a 28 percent rise,
underscoring the country's efforts to shift its economy towards
greater reliance on domestic consumption.	
 Last week, the MSCI Asia Pacific equity index, excluding
Japan, fell 2.65 percent, suffering its biggest weekly drop
since Aug. 2010.	
 Investors pulled out some $3 billion from Emerging Markets
Equity Funds tracked by EPFR Global in the week ended Feb. 9.
This marked a third straight week of outflows and was the worst
three-week run in three years, the fund tracker said.	
 But Japanese equities, which lagged the region last year,
saw some of the best inflows. Japan still has a low
price-to-book ratio of 1.2, according to Thomson Reuters
StarMine, among the most attractive in Asia. This compares with
2.0 for Hong Kong and 2.5 for Australia.	
 ""Investors are seeing value in Japanese exporters geared to
fast growing regional emerging markets where the yen's value
versus the dollar is not an issue. Inflation is also not an
issue for the world's third largest economy,"" the fund tracker
said.	
 According to figures from Nomura, foreign investors have
bought $12.2 billion worth of Japanese stocks so far this year.
They sold $210 million of Asian stocks excluding Japan.	
 ""Developed markets tend to be much better at dealing with
higher input costs from particularly commodities and energy,
because they're less sensitive to those factors,"" said Sean
Darby, chief Asian equity strategist at Nomura in Hong Kong.	
 In the currency market, the dollar eased against a basket of
major currencies. Versus the yen, it slipped 0.5 percent to
83.15 as Japanese exporters sold the greenback, taking
advantage of its rise last week to a three-week high. 
 U.S. crude steadied near $85.50 per barrel after
falling to 10-week lows, while copper edged up 0.7 percent to
$10,030 a tonne. Spot gold was little changed at $1,358
an ounce.

 By Wayne Cole	
 SYDNEY, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Forget conventional notions of
""real"" when it comes to the Australian economy and remember
that people live in a ""nominal"" world, for it's certain that
policymakers have.	
 Australia is enjoying a once-in-a-century boom in its terms
of trade, which is fuelling a massive rise in resource
investment and driving nominal economic growth -- which is
measured using current prices -- at a nearly double-digit pace.	
 But because this is essentially a change in relative prices
and not volumes, much of the wealth generated is understated in
the real, or inflation-adjusted, measure of gross domestic
product (GDP) that usually dominates media coverage of the
economy.	
 The distinction is particularly important now as dire
weather will likely depress the real measure of Australian GDP
this quarter and last, perhaps even resulting in a two quarters
of contraction -- a common definition of recession. 
 Such an outcome would cause much lamentation in the media
and could lead some investors to conclude the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) might have to cut interest rates.	
 That would be a mistake, say analysts.	
 ""It is just possible we could have a technical recession,
but even if it happens it'll be a recession in name only,"" said
Brian Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie.	
 ""Nominal GDP growth will remain strong and that's what
counts for profits, employment, investment and so much else,"" he
added. ""It's also what counts for the RBA and rates.""	
 Figures for last quarter's GDP are due on March 2 but the
national accounts for the current quarter will not be out until
June 1. The RBA is confident that by then the economy should be
rebounding strongly, thanks to rebuilding and an historically
high terms of trade, and many analysts assume it will be
thinking of tightening again.	
 Thus the release of a potentially negative real GDP number
in June could prove a head-fake for markets, leading investors
to underestimate the risk of a rise in rates.	
 ""We need to break our attachment to real GDP as the one
metric that matters -- it's not,"" said Paul Bloxham, a former
RBA staff member who is chief economist for Australia and New
Zealand at HSBC.	
 ""I think the RBA sees the importance of nominal GDP these
days,"" he added. ""After all, if it keeps growing at 10 percent a
year the economy will have doubled in just seven years. That's
an awful lot of growth.""	
 
 
 LET'S NOT KEEP IT REAL	
 Nominal GDP, which measures the value of output by current
prices, is usually overlooked in preference for real GDP, which
aims to strips out changes in prices. Normally, the preference
for ""real"" figures is warranted, for if the GDP increases just
because the price of goods is rising, then nothing extra is
being produced, and nobody is better off.	
 Australia's A$1.3 trillion in annual GDP is not up because
of domestic prices -- consumer price inflation is subdued at
2.7 percent -- but because of a sea change in external prices.	
 A strong Australian dollar has been making imports cheaper
while unceasing demand from China and India has lifted prices
for Australia's commodity exports to stratospheric heights.	
 As a result, the ratio of export to import prices, or the
terms of trade, has surged to levels not seen since the 1950s.	
 RBA Governor Glenn Stevens recently noted that five years
ago, a ship load of Australian iron ore was worth about the same
as 2,200 flat screen television sets. Now that shipment was
worth about 22,000 flat-screen TV sets.	
 When expressed in hard cash, the sums are staggering. For
every year the terms of trade remain at such high levels, this
would be worth between 12 and 15 percent of GDP in extra income,
or around A$150 billion to A$200 billion.	
 The headline measure of GDP counts this as a change in
prices and strips much of it out, but the money is real enough
and shows up in nominal growth. The difference was vividly clear
in the most recent GDP report, for the third quarter of 2010.	
 Real GDP grew by 2.7 percent for the year, a decent enough
performance in the developed world. But annual growth in nominal
GDP was a blistering 9.6 percent, a pace normally only boasted
by developing nations.	
 And this is not a short-term phenomenon. In the five years
to September 2010, real GDP grew by a total 14 percent, while
nominal GDP rose 39 percent. Over the decade, the relative
growth numbers are 35 percent and 95 percent. For both
timeframes, Australia's nominal growth was double that of the
United States.	
 This torrent of cash showed up in company profits, which
climbed 20 percent for the year. Gross operating profits in
mining alone rose a record 80 percent in the year to September,
and a lot more is coming.	
 Just last week, Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto
reported a net profit of $14 billion, more than double
the previous year. No less than $9.5 billion of the increase in
underlying earnings came from higher prices alone.	
 Competitor BHP Billiton is soon expected to boast a
pre-tax profit of as much as $30 billion for the year.	
 ""In a way it's a positive productivity shock in that it
takes no extra effort to produce these commodities, yet firms
earn so much more from them,"" said Bloxham at HSBC. 
 Miners are so flush with cash that they can fund truly
massive investment spending and still satisfy shareholder
demands to buy back shares. Mining investment is already up at
4.5 percent of GDP, three times the historic rate, and the RBA
expects it to hit 5.5 percent in the next couple of years.	
 Also, miners are able to reward their workers well.
Government data shows that their wage bill in the third quarter
of 2010 was 20 percent higher than the year before.	
 ""The miners have a hell of a lot of money to spend on
investment, wages and employment, and that spreads through the
economy in all sorts of ways,"" said Macquarie's Redican. 
 Those bumper profits offer some idea of just how much money
the Australian government is raking in from the mining boom.
That is one reason the Labor government remains confident it can
get its budget back in surplus by 2013/14, a distant dream for
many other developed nations.	
 Rio Tinto alone paid $5.3 billion in taxes for 2010.	
 ""If commodity prices hold up, the tax windfall could easily
equal A$10 billion for the government,"" said Redican. ""Numbers
as big as this are in no way 'nominal'.""

 By Zhou Xin and Kevin Yao	
 BEIJING, Feb 14 (Reuters) - China's trade surplus fell to
its lowest in nine months in January after imports surged,
supporting the government's case ahead of a G20 meeting that it
is doing enough to spur domestic demand without speeding up
currency appreciation.	
 The trade surplus shrank to $6.5 billion from $13.1 billion
in December, well short of forecasts for a $10.7 billion gap.	
 Global stocks and commodity prices climbed higher, with the
surprisingly strong imports highlighting China's massive
appetite for raw materials and its solid export growth hinting
at solidifying recoveries in the U.S. and European economies.	
 In the past, a weaker surplus would have caused concern for
the Chinese government, but more recently it has been trying to
shift the economy towards greater reliance on consumption and
less on exports, in part to address critics who say that its
success has come at the expense of other countries.	
 It was the third consecutive month of a declining trade
surplus, and though not enough to mark a definitive change, that
streak provides a symbolic boost to China before the G20 meeting
this week of finance ministers from the world's biggest
developed and developing economies.	
 Analysts warned, however, that its surplus could rebound
later this year.	
 ""There tends to be a seasonal pattern and there is generally
a decline in the trade surplus at the beginning of the year,""
said Jian Chang, an economist with Barclays Capital in Hong
Kong. ""Exports tend to be weak in the first quarter, while there
is no such pattern in imports.""	
 The G20 meeting in Paris on Feb 18-19 will try to hash out a
gameplan for tackling the global economic imbalances that
exacerbated and, some say, helped trigger the financial crisis
in 2008, with China's yawning trade surplus seen as one of the
chief problems.

 GLOBAL STRENGTH	
 China's imports rose 51 percent in January from a year
earlier, blowing past market forecasts for a 28 percent rise.
Exports rose 37.7 percent in January, topping expectations for a
22.4 percent rise, the customs administration said.	
 Iron ore prices edged up further to fresh highs after the
data, which showed that China was building steel product
stockpiles in anticipation of more demand. Asian stocks
rallied, snapping five straight sessions of losses.

 Yu Song and Helen Qiao, economists at Goldman Sachs, said
that the import and export growth reflected well on both the
Chinese and global economy.	
 ""The strong exports growth momentum is supported by
improvements in economic conditions in China's major trading
partners, and strong imports growth momentum is supported by
strong domestic demand growth,"" they wrote in a note. ""Besides,
the rise in imported commodity prices likely contributed to
strong imports data as well.""	
 Copper and iron ore prices ran near record highs for much of
January and oil was also costly, pushing up China's import bill.	
 Commodity-exporting countries were the clear beneficiaries.
Imports from South Africa were up 212.5 percent year on year,
while shipments from Canada and Brazil were up 146.7 percent and
95.4 percent, respectively.	
 But economists also cautioned against reading too much into
the January data, because trade performance was probably
affected by the Chinese New Year. It fell earlier in 2011 than
in 2010, leading firms to rush to make shipments and order goods
in the final weeks of January before the holiday.	
 ""The bigger-than-expected numbers may have been distorted by
seasonal factors, so growth may be a bit slower in coming
months,"" said Wang Hu, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in
Shanghai.	
 
 CURRENCY CONTENTION	
 Along with serving as a signal of economic rebalancing, a
smaller trade surplus also means that less money is rushing into
China, easing the upward pressure on prices that has pushed
inflation to its fastest rate in more than two years.	
 China will report its January inflation data on Tuesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise 5.3
percent in the year to January, a 30-month high, but traders
said on Monday that the increase was likely to be 4.9 percent,
because adjustments of the consumer price index will have
reduced the weight given to fast-rising food prices.

 The combination of slower inflation and a narrower trade
surplus will embolden Chinese officials who have resisted faster
currency appreciation.	
 The yuan has risen 3.5 percent against the dollar since it
was depegged in June 2010, but it has been largely level this
year. 
 Critics say that China keeps the yuan weak in order to make
its goods cheaper in global markets, giving its exporters an
unfair advantage. The United States has long voiced these
complaints, but in recent weeks Brazil and India, China's
fast-growing developing peers, have also expressed frustrations.	
 The U.S. Treasury, in a long-delayed report, declined to
say this month that China manipulates its currency for trade
advantage, noting that higher inflation was making its goods
more expensive.	
 ""The United States has done the semi-annual (currency)
report, so there is more breathing space for now. But the U.S.
pressure will stay and one smaller-than-expected trade surplus
number won't change that,"" said Andy Ji, economist with
Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.

 * Dollar firmer, further gains possible this week
 * Yen bounces off 3-week low on Japanese corporate bids
 * Aussie dollar cautious ahead of Chinese data
 By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The euro teetered at a key
technical level against the dollar on Monday, with a break of
that support seen likely to deepen its decline as markets turn
cautious ahead of a slew of events this week.
 Among them, fund-raising by Italy and Spain in the bond
market will be closely watched, especially after Portuguese
government bond yields recently jumped to euro-era highs,
renewing worries about the funding costs of highly indebted euro
zone countries.
 The yen bounced back from a three-week low on buying by
Japanese companies, though traders say it looks increasingly
under pressure on charts.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent from late U.S. levels to
$1.3526, struggling to recover above its 100-day moving average
at $1.3542, although it managed to stay above a three-week low of
$1.3497 hit late last week.
 A break of the widely perceived pivotal level of $1.35
could quickly see a test of $1.3483, a level representing a
38.2 percent retracement of its Jan. 10-Feb. 2 rally.
 ""But the next level in the $1.33s will hold it. I can't see
anything between the U.S. and Europe which would drive it below
that at this point without some significant deterioration in
conditions in Europe,"" said Gregg Gibbs, a strategist at RBS.
 Some traders also said the euro is being helped by persistent
speculation of buying by Asian central banks.
 ""On one hand you have rising credit spreads in the euro zone,
but on the other hand many traders see some buying,"" said
Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and
Banking.
 With the euro on the back foot, the dollar was not far from
its highest level in three weeks against a basket of six major
currencies. The dollar index stood at 78.347, compared with the
high of 78.697 hit on Friday.
 Versus the yen, the greenback slipped 0.3 percent to 83.16
yen as Japanese exporters took advantage of its rise last week to
a three-week high of 83.68 yen.
 Upbeat U.S. data had helped shore up the dollar in the past
few sessions as investors covered short positions
 ""We're seeing a better trend for the dollar as U.S. economic
numbers are improving,"" said Gibbs at RBS. A raft of U.S. data is
due this week including retail sales and consumer prices.
 Also helping dollar/yen is the fact that the U.S. 10-year real
yield has reached 2.4 percent, the highest within the G10, while
Japan's real 10-year sovereign yield is a more modest 1.2
percent, BNP Paribas analysts said.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
speculators raised bets against the dollar to the highest level
since October for the week to Feb. 8, meaning there could be
scope for further dollar gains if markets cut short positions.
 Japanese investors may sell the dollar from coupon payments
on U.S. Treasuries on Feb. 15 and Japanese firms' repatriation
ahead of the financial year-end on March 31 could cap the dollar,
at least in Asian trade, traders say.
 But the dollar looks increasingly firm on charts, having
broken clearly above various moving averages, including its 21-
and 55-day averages, in the past few sessions, with the next
possible target seen at its December resistance around 84.50 yen.
 ""If the dollar/yen rate breaks above 84.50 yen, that would
change the whole sentiment of the market,"" a trader at a Japanese
bank said.
 Also closely watched this week is a batch of Chinese data
including inflation scheduled for release on Tuesday. Analysts
polled by Reuters expect inflation to have accelerated to 5.3
percent from 4.6 percent.
 A stronger-than-expected reading could fuel worries that
China will have to lift interest rates more aggressively,
raising the risk of slower growth.
 This could put the Australian dollar under pressure.
 But as Shanghai shares gained on speculation about softer
inflation data, the Aussie gained 0.35 percent to $1.0058.

 * Copper back above $10,000 a tonne
(Updates prices)	
 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Monday as
investors greeted news of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
resignation with relief, while U.S. crude steadied near $85.50
per barrel after falling to 10-week lows as geopolitical
tensions eased for now.	
 Mubarak handed power over to the army, bowing to escalating
pressure from the military and protesters demanding he goes. His
departure was seen partially reviving investors' appetite for
risk. 
 This also helped copper climbed above $10,000 a tonne
, while the dollar came under some pressure.	
 The Nikkei climbed 0.8 percent after data showed
Japan's economy shrank slightly in the final quarter of last
year but beat forecasts for a bigger contraction. Analysts
expect a recovery this year on stronger exports to China and
other parts of fast-growing Asia. 
 ""What with good corporate earnings, the resignation of
Mubarak and other helpful factors, the investment environment is
good,"" said Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online
Securities. 
 
 Stocks elsewhere in Asia gained 1.2 percent
with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index up 1.0 percent. South
Korea's KOSPI , Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and
China's Shanghai Composite index were all more than 1
percent higher.	
 Talk of slower-than-expected inflation in China, a day ahead
of the official release, also helped shore up the Chinese
market.	
 Traders said the consumer price index may have risen 4.9
percent in the year to January, well below the consensus
forecast of 5.3 percent.	
 Last week, the MSCI Asia Pacific equity index, excluding
Japan, fell 2.65 percent, suffering its biggest weekly drop
since Aug. 2010.	
 Questions over whether officials in emerging economies will
succeed in tackling inflation have prompted investors to pull
out some $3 billion from Emerging Markets Equity Funds tracked
by EPFR Global in the week ended Feb. 9. 
 This marked a third straight week of outflows and was the
worst three-week run in three years, the fund tracker said.	
 But Japanese equities, which lagged the region last year,
saw some of the best inflows. Japan still has a low
price-to-book ratio of 1.2, according to Thomson Reuters
StarMine, among the most attractive in Asia. This compares with
2.0 for Hong Kong and 2.5 for Australia.	
 ""Investors are seeing value in Japanese exporters geared to
fast growing regional emerging markets where the yen's value
versus the dollar is not an issue. Inflation is also not an
issue for the world's third largest economy,"" the fund tracker
said.	
 The dollar slipped against the euro and the yen. Traders
said Japanese exporters have been active sellers of the
greenback, taking advantage of the dollar's rise to three-week
highs late last week.	
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, slipped 0.14
percent. 
 U.S. crude oil was a touch firmer at $85.60, but
still not far off a 10-week low of $85.10 plumbed last Friday.
Spot gold was little changed at $1,357.20 an ounce.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Leika Kihara	
 TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank slightly in
the final quarter of 2010 but analysts expect a recovery this
year as stronger exports to China and other parts of
fast-growing Asia offset persistently weak domestic demand.	
 The data confirmed Japan lost its place to China last year
as the world's second-largest economy and highlighted Tokyo's
increasing reliance on its giant neighbour, which buys nearly a
fifth of Japan's exports.	
 Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.3 percent in the
October-December period from the previous quarter, slightly less
than a 0.5 percent fall expected by markets but still the first
contraction in five quarters.	
 That translated into an annualised contraction of 1.1
percent, with analysts largely blaming the weakness on a
temporary hit to consumption after the September expiry of
government incentives to buy low-emission cars.	
 The data showed Japan's economy was the weakest among major
rich nations, compared with annualised growth of 3.2 percent in
the United States in the same quarter. European data due out on
Tuesday is expected to show slight growth in the 17-nation euro
zone.	
 ""The data confirms that the economy entered a lull on a
downturn in private consumption, but recent monthly economic
indicators such as output and exports show it is unlikely that
the lull will be prolonged,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, senior
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.	
 ""The economy will continue to depend on external demand for
growth, as domestic demand is likely to be capped by subdued
income growth and the anticipated negative impact from the
expiry of subsidies for energy-efficient electrical appliances.""	
 
 
 CHINA THE NEW NO.2	
 The latest GDP figures confirmed analysts' estimates that
China pulled ahead of Japan in 2010 as the world's
second-biggest economy behind the United States on a seasonally
unadjusted, nominal dollar basis, at $5.8786 trillion against
$5.4742 trillion.	
 Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said Japan needed to make
the most of China's growth to boost its own fortunes, as it
increasingly relies on demand from its Asian neighbour.	
 ""The fact that China's economy is booming is welcome news
for Japan as a neighbouring country,"" Yosano told reporters
after the release of the data. ""We want to deepen the amicable
economic relationship between Japan and China.""	
 Japan's shipments to mainland China accounted for 19.4
percent of its overall exports last year, making it the No.1
destination for Japanese goods, followed by the United States at
about 15.4 percent.	
 The signs of an export-led recovery prompted the government
to upgrade its economic assessment last month and dampened
expectations of any imminent monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan. 
 BOJ policymakers meeting this Monday and Tuesday may see no
immediate need to ease policy further through an increase of
asset purchases and may instead focus on assessing the strength
of the recovery. 
 While recent data showed exports and industrial output rose
more than expected in December, a pick-up in the corporate
sector is seen unlikely to spill over to personal consumption,
which makes up about 60 percent of GDP.	
 Capital expenditure rose 0.9 percent from the previous
quarter, slower than the 1.5 percent pace of gains in
July-September.	
 Analysts said the increase in capital spending may not lead
to stronger consumer spending as companies remain reluctant to
boost wages due to fierce global competition, and as workers put
a higher priority on job security than wage hikes.	
 The roll-back of government incentives for purchases of
energy-efficient household electronics in December will also
weigh on private consumption, which fell 0.7 percent from the
previous quarter after a 0.9 percent increase in July-September.	
 External demand, or net exports, shaved 0.1 percentage point
off GDP, with the yen's spike to a 15-year high against the
dollar during the period hurting exports.	
 
 BOJ STANDS PAT	
 As the economy remains mired in stubborn deflation, the BOJ
is in no position to roll back its comprehensive easing anytime
soon. That is in stark contrast with policymakers in other parts
of Asia, Europe and elsewhere where the focus is shifting from
supporting sustainable recoveries to controlling inflation.	
 China raised interest rates last week for the second time in
just over six weeks and further policy tightening is expected
from Beijing in the coming months, raising the prospect of a
slowdown in Chinese demand for everything from imported
electronics to construction equipment and cars. 
 Nissan Motor Co , Japan's No.2 automaker, raised its
annual profit and sales forecasts last week as its big drive
into emerging markets such as China pays off. [ID:TOE71801W}	
 But with Japan's domestic demand expected to remain weak, a
heavy reliance on exports to fuel recovery is expected to pose a
risk if external demand stumbles.	
 ""Risks from overseas economies and currency moves need to be
closely watched,"" Economics Minister Yosano said, noting that
financial markets were also monitoring the government's ability
to enact legislation in a divided parliament.	
 Highlighting concerns about prolonged political paralysis, a
Kyodo news agency survey showed support for Prime Minister Naoto
Kan's government had fallen below 20 percent, a level where some
premiers have been nudged out of power in the past.

 * Overseers of police, army still to be decided
 * Biden urges prompt completion of government formation
(Updates with U.S. statement)
 BAGHDAD, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament approved
eight new ministers on Sunday but Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki
has yet to decide who will hold sensitive security posts in the
cabinet such as defence and interior.
 Maliki's new government was approved in late December after
nine months of political wrangling but he left 10 cabinet posts
with acting leaders, keeping the Defence Ministry, which runs
the army, Interior, which controls the police, and National
Security for himself temporarily.
 Iraq is trying to solidify its nascent democracy in the
face of a stubborn insurgency nearly eight years after the
U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, before
U.S. troops complete their withdrawal by year's end.
 Parliament approved new electricity and trade ministers,
two key positions covering provision of basic services and
food, the focus of recent protests in Baghdad and the
provinces.
 U.S. Vice President Joe Biden congratulated Maliki on the
approval of the ministers during a call on Sunday, the White
House said in a statement.
 ""The vice president commended the prime minister for his
role in consolidating Iraq's democratic progress, and
encouraged the prompt completion of the final steps for
government formation, including the appointment of security
ministers and the establishment of the National Council for
Higher Policies,"" the statement said.
 The two men also discussed events in Egypt, it said.
 The new power minister, Raad Shallal, has worked for the
ministry since 1987 and holds a masters degree in engineering.
 Intermittent electricity is one of Iraqis' biggest gripes.
 Current production is only 7,000 megawatts, about 5,000
megawatts short of demand, acting Electricity Minister Hussain
al-Shahristani said on Saturday as he announced a plan to give
Iraqis 1,000 kilowatt-hours of free power each month.
 The new trade minister is Khairalla Hasan, a Kurdish
veterinarian with 20 years' experience in trade in Iraq's
semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region.
 Food and power have been at the heart of numerous recent
street protests, which seem likely to grow with the approach of
summer, when temperatures rise above 50 degrees Celsius.
 Maliki also announced his picks for the posts of women's
affairs, tribal affairs, municipalities, civilian community
affairs, national reconciliation and a minister of state
without portfolio, and said he would submit other nominees to
parliament within days.
 ""I would like to assure members of parliament I will bring
up the security ministers to parliament very soon to be
approved,"" Maliki told lawmakers.

323,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2011 11:48AM ET</span>",Trichet urges strengthening of financial system," BERLIN, Feb 13 (Reuters) - European Central Bank president
Jean-Claude Trichet called on Sunday for industrial nations to
work further to strengthen the global financial system, saying
it would be ""gigantic foolishness"" to grow complacent.
 Dangers and risks were still lurking even though central
banks and governments had made difficult decisions in the wake
of the financial crisis, Trichet said in an interview with the
Weser-Kurier newspaper in Bremen to appear on Monday.
 ""We cannot afford to be complacent,"" he said. ""We were able
to avoid a disaster that would have been worse than in the 30s.
 ""To continue on as before would be gigantic foolishness. I
won't accept the argument we should return to 'business as
usual'. We know how vulnerable the financial system was and
we've got to do everything to strengthen this fragile system so
that such an event can be prevented in the future.""
 Trichet told the newspaper that in the euro zone it was
important to improve financial policy coordination. He said he
supported ideas from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel for greater policy coordination and
surveillance.
 ""The monetary union that the euro is based upon functions
well,"" he said. ""The currency has credibility and it's been
proven that it ensures price stability. Now it's time for the
economic union to function as well. That wasn't the case in the
past.
 ""That's why we've got to strengthen the surveillance of
economic policies,"" he said.
 Trichet noted that the annual inflation rate in Germany was
on average 1.5 percent in the last 12 years. That was better
than in the 50 years before the euro was launched and also
better than the average in the euro zone.
 ""Obviously we didn't have any control in the past over
surges in oil prices and other raw materials,"" he said. ""But
peolpe can be sure that we will do everything in the future to
prevent a second-round effect after external shocks and thus
ensure middle-term price stability.""

Peer Steinbrueck said on Sunday he was not interested in being a
candidate to lead the European Central Bank because he shares
the same views as outgoing Bundesbank president Axel Weber.
 Steinbrueck's name was proposed by Frank-Walter Steinmeier,
parliamentary leader of the opposition Social Democrats.
Steinbrueck is also a leading figure in the SPD.
 Weber confirmed on Saturday he would not be a candidate to
head the ECB, blaming resistance in some European countries to
his hardline monetarist stance.
 ""I'm not available for this job,"" Steinbrueck was quoted as
telling the Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an advance copy of an
article due to appear on Monday. He said he believes it is wrong
when a former finance minister switches to a body like the ECB.
 Steinbrueck, who was finance minister until 2009, added that
he also had many of the same views as Weber.
 ""Thus I'd automatically have a minority position,""
Steinbrueck said.
 Weber, in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, said he
feared the credibility of the ECB presidency would have suffered
if as president he held a minority view on key questions,
pointing to his ""clear position"" on important decisions.
 ""These positions might not have always been helpful for my
acceptance in some governments,"" Weber said, referring to his
criticism in May of the ECB's decision to buy bonds as part of a
concerted push to try to resolve the euro zone's debt crisis.
 The German government announced on Friday that Weber would
step down as head of the Bundesbank a year before his term ends,
formally ending his chances of becoming the next ECB president.
 Weber's withdrawal was a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel's
drive to secure the ECB post for a German.

 * Loose fiscal policy, weak currency to fuel inflation
 
 By Reed Stevenson
 DUBAI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Egypt's military council faces a
daunting challenge to stabilise the economy after 18 days of
protests which may cut growth this year in half and have left
regulators nervous about the reopening of its capital markets.
 In the short-run, analysts hope that there will be an
orderly transition to democracy and that may halt outflows of
capital which have reached as much as $1 billion per day at the
height of the revolt.
 Many investors are also optimistic about the broader changes
to business and policy that may follow under a freely-elected
government but there is little prospect of a step change in the
near term.
 ""In terms of the economy, Egypt has been run by the same
technocrats for the last 30 years,"" said Tim Ash, head of
emerging markets research at RBS. ""I don't think you're going to
see too much of a change.""
 ""The establishment are still around. Their real agenda is no
change until September,"" he said.
 Egypt's economy was worth an estimated $217 billion last
year, half of oil giant Saudi Arabia, and relies on foreign
investments, tourism and fees from the Suez Canal 
 A month before the protests erupted on Jan. 25, analysts
polled by Reuters had expected growth of 5.4 percent in the
fiscal year ending in June, second in the Gulf Arab region only
to Qatar. The government had forecast 6 percent expansion. 
 But while banks and some shops are reopening, tourists --
who account for between 5 and 11 percent of economic output --
are still shunning the popular holiday hub, making the growth
predictions look optimistic.
 Said Hirsch, Middle East economist at Capital Economics,
said the main priority would be bringing society back to normal
and get people working again.
 ""The military's role will be to stabilise the economic
situation,"" he said.
 
 MARKET NERVES
 Officials on Saturday pushed back the opening of the stock
market for a second time, from Sunday to next Wednesday, and the
Egyptian pound had to be propped up by intervention by the
central bank last week.
 At the peak of the unrest, some analysts speculated the bank
would have to make an emergency rise in interest rates to aid
the pound. 
 Optimism over Hosni Mubarek's departure -- which has helped
emerging markets globally -- make that move less likely, but the
currency's weakness also adds to the likelihood of higher
inflation and an eventual rise in rates.
 Ratings agencies also downgraded Egypt's sovereign ratings
by one notch as protests intensified, citing possible damage to
already weak state finances.
 ""We believe the central bank will hike rates by 100 basis
points in an emergency meeting this month as inflation is likely
to surge on the back of a weaker pound,"" said Dina Ahmad, CEEMEA
strategist at BNP Paribas.
 Lower private consumption, which accounts for around 70
percent of GDP, a drop in foreign investments and higher
unemployment are also expected to hurt economic performance.
 Although Mubarak's promise of a double-digit salary raise
for public sector workers will now likely be scrapped, the
transitional government is likely to keep up spending.
 Lower taxes, higher subsidies and pressures to give more
money to unemployed may also undermine the crude oil-importer's
fiscal health, with the budget gap likely to balloon towards 10
percent of GDP this year, according to BNP Paribas.
 ""First we need to see a return to normality,"" said Lars
Christensen, senior emerging markets analyst at Danske Bank.
""Then I think the recovery could be relatively short.""
 
 SPENDING VS INFLATION
 Long-term, the outlook is cloudier.
 If the economy worsens, any resulting social instability
could become a graver geopolitical concern and to prevent that,
Egypt may also be well-positions to receive a boost in foreign
aid.
 ""I think it's the case that the United States and the Gulf
(countries) could bring more aid to Egypt,"" said Hirsch. ""A lot
of money could come from the Gulf.
 Gulf Arab rulers, as well as the United States, see Egypt as
a key ally to counter Iran's growing influence in the region,
and will want to keep the country economically healthy and
stable.
 Among Gulf countries, Yemen, Bahrain and Kuwait have already
offered cash or concessions, eyeing similar young populations
and simmering discontent.
 Beyond that, the prospect of a freer and more transparent
economy under new regime could draw substantial inflows of
investment looking to grab market share in the country of 80
million.
 ""When you have less than, say, 10 percent of the population
with checking accounts, there is potential for growth,"" said
Karim Baghdady, managing director of Egyptian-based investment
bank Beltone in New York. 
 ""When you have a gray economy that is almost as large as the
official GDP, if you are able to institutionalize that economy,
then people will start securitizing their debts, able to borrow
more, buy more. So there is a big domino effect.""

permanent rescue mechanism for the euro zone, meaning it will

the challenge facing Chancellor Angela Merkel to convince the

 As a quid pro quo for her support for the scheme, Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy have put forward proposals for
a ""competitiveness pact"" which is to be hammered out by March
and has provoked strong opposition from other EU leaders.
 Berlin's ability to compromise on the steps -- which seek to
end wage indexation, raise retirement ages and lock debt limits
into national constitutions -- may be influenced by what the
government can sell to a domestic audience.
 Der Spiegel said the legal opinion on the issue -- pointed
to by an MP from Merkel's junior coalition partners -- found
that a two-thirds majority would be required because the
European Stabilisation Mechanism (ESM) would involve an
extensive intrusion into the Bundestag's administrative

Chancellor Angela Merkel, as a leading candidate to replace him
at the helm of the Bundesbank when he steps down from the German
central bank in April.
 In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine released on
Saturday, Weber said he feared the credibility of the ECB
presidency would have suffered if as president he held a
minority view on key questions, pointing to his ""clear position""
in the last year on important decisions.
 ""These positions might not have always been helpful for my
acceptance in some governments,"" Weber said, referring to his
criticism in May of the ECB's decision to buy bonds as part of a
concerted push to try to resolve the euro zone's debt crisis.
 The German government announced on Friday that Weber would
step down as head of the Bundesbank a year before his term ends,
formally ending his chances of becoming the next ECB president.
The interview was Weber's first comment publicly since.
 Weber said the bonds programme carried significant risks and
his call for the ECB to end it earned a public rebuke from
Trichet just as the debate was starting about who should be the
next ECB president.
 ""So since May I was aware that a potential candidacy would
be damaged,"" Weber told Der Spiegel. ""My decision grew during
this time not to aspire for this important office.""
 Weber said he sent signals to the German government in the
autumn that he had other options and had spoken with Chancellor
Angela Merkel about it in January. Since January his decision
not to be a candidate had grown firmer, he said.
 
 INFLATION FIGHT
 The 53-year old, an inflation-fighting monetary ""hawk"", was
widely seen as the frontrunner to replace Trichet when his term
ends in October.
 His withdrawal has thrown the ECB race wide open and fed
unease in financial markets about the ability of divided
European policymakers to solve the euro zone's sovereign debt
crisis.
 The ECB has played a crucial role in responding to the
crisis, buying the bonds of debt-stricken peripheral euro zone
countries as part of a concerted push to calm markets. 
 Analysts also wonder if whoever is appointed instead of
Weber will take as tough a line on fighting inflation and other
policy issues as the Bundesbank chief.
 Weber told Der Spiegel that, despite his criticism of that
decision, he had the same view as Trichet and other ECB board
members ""on most issues."" He said there was no fundamental
dissent in the ECB.
 ""The ECB is the bulwark of stability in Europe,"" Weber said.
""This young institution proved that impressively in the recent
crisis. The president has a special role. However, if he has a
minority position in important questions, then the credibility
of this office suffers.""
 Weber said he has no immediate plans to take a post at a
commercial bank and he would not take a new job before 2012.
 He went out of his way to praise Merkel economic adviser
Weidmann as a leading candidate to replace him at the
Bundesbank, saying the central bank would have younger leaders.
Weidmann is 42.
 ""We need a signal of rejuvenation,"" Weber said. ""Political
leaders often saw the Bundesbank as an institution for
(political) party balance. We need board members who've got
international expertise.""
 He added: ""Weidmann is an excellent economist. Despite being
young, he's got a lot of experience and is a top professional.
It's not fair to put him close to political leaders. He is
actually on loan from the Bundesbank to the government.""

 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar is destined to
continue gaining against the euro next week as the single
currency enters a period filled with obstacles, from widening
peripheral sovereign bond spreads to a hefty funding schedule
and an abundance of key economic data.
 While the euro hit a three-week low against the dollar on
Friday and breached a widely perceived pivotal level of $1.35,
it ended the week nearly unchanged. Technical analysts eyed a
close below its 100-day moving average at $1.3542, for the
first time since Jan. 17, which would indicate the single euro
zone currency should see further downside.
 ""An abundance of factors should work against the euro next
week,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 Euro zone debt markets became increasingly unsettled in
recent days as Portuguese 10-year bond yields reached record
highs, sparking fresh concerns about funding costs in
peripheral euro zone economies.
 ""Concerns about Europe's debt problems have moved back to
the forefront and should cause the dollar to appreciate
gradually,"" he said.
 Uncertainty surrounding the European Central Bank's policy
should also weigh on the euro. Bundesbank chief Axel Weber, a
known policy hawk, will not succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as
president of the ECB, according to reports this week, adding to
doubts that euro zone rates would rise in the near future.
 ""We see the euro as entering a more uncertain period ahead
of the euro zone leaders' summit in mid-March and the heavier
sovereign funding schedule for Portugal and Spain in the coming
months,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells
Fargo in New York.
 The euro next week could break through the technical
support level of $1.35 and trade in the mid- to lower-$1.34
range, Esiner said.
 Economic data is plentiful next week and many euro-area
economies will release their preliminary estimates of fourth
quarter GDP growth.
 Part the dollar's strength this past week could be
attributed to short-covering and data indicates more upside
potential.

 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.3

lies at $1.3500, a point that traders cited as an options

 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - World stocks surged while oil
prices fell on Friday after the resignation of President Hosni
Mubarak in Egypt bolstered sentiment among investors who feared
regional unrest could disrupt Middle East crude supplies.

 However, the U.S. dollar and government debt strengthened
on worries about the transfer of power in Egypt and potential

 Data that showed the U.S. economic recovery is gaining

 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar strengthened
against other currencies on Friday after briefly losing ground
on news that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down,
with the greenback's appeal expected to continue given
technical factors weighing on the euro.
 The euro hit a three-week low, and as it failed twice to
break the $1.35 level, this put even more focus on the
downside.
 The euro temporarily pared losses after Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak stepped down and handed power over to the Supreme
Council of the Armed Forces. For the latest stories on Egypt,
see [ID:nLDE71327H]
 ""It was a kneejerk reaction and it didn't last because
there are bigger things driving the euro right now,"" said Brian
Dolan, chief currency strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster,
New Jersey.
 ""Egypt is now seen as a regional political drama and the
market seems to think the risk of a fundamentalist takeover
there is overblown. But the concerns most heavily weighing on
the euro -- the ongoing debt crisis -- are still there, and for
now, the downside is still in play,"" he said.
 Win Thin, global head of emerging markets strategy, at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said there are still more
questions than answers with regard to Egypt's fate and so
investors must be prepared for ongoing volatility.
 ""Will the protesters trust the military and will it be able
to deliver on official promises to open up the country to
greater democracy and freedoms?,"" he said. ""We are hopeful, but
if the protesters continue to push for more immediate relief,
will the military allow them to continue or will it crack
down?""
 The dollar has smartly benefited from a spate of U.S.
economic data reflecting a recovery well underway and most
strategists are looking for more outperformance on the dollar.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro fell 0.4
percent to trade at $1.3532 , after earlier hitting
$1.3497 -- its lowest since Jan. 21. Key support for the euro
lies at $1.3500, a point that traders cited as an options
barrier, with reports of strong bids ahead of that level.
 Technical analysts said if the pair closes below the euro's
100-day moving average at $1.3542, it would be the first time
since Jan. 17. As a result, the single euro zone currency could
see further downside.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the
greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, was up
0.3 percent at 78.508.
 Traders said the European Central Bank bought Portuguese
bonds after yields on the country's debt hit euro-era highs.
The latest spike in yields has sparked fresh concerns about
funding costs in peripheral euro zone economies.
 Bond yields have also been driving the price in euro/dollar
in favor of the greenback, with spreads between two-year U.S.
Treasuries and German Bunds narrowing, said Andrew Busch,
global currency strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago.
 He said the two-year U.S. Treasury/Bund spread peaked in
late January at around 89 basis points, but has since narrowed
to 60 basis points or less, describing this as a big deal.
 The dollar's outperperformance against the yen has been
stronger than the euro. The greenback, which gained versus the
yen for eight straight sessions, is on track for a weekly gain
of 1.6 percent, its best performance in more than a month.
 The dollar touched its highest level in a month at 83.68
yen , and was last up 0.3 percent at 83.52 yen,
boosted by the rising trend in U.S. Treasury yields.
 The dollar also made headway against the Swiss franc,
rising to a one-month high at 0.9750 on demand from a Swiss
bank. The franc was further undermined on weaker-than-expected
Swiss inflation data released Thursday.
 The dollar  was last at 0.9730, up 0.4 percent.

 * Rival government says head of pro-Gbagbo body dismissed
 (Adds details, comment)
 By David Brough and Ange Aboa
 LONDON/ABIDJAN, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The cocoa trade was torn
on Friday between conflicting orders on exports and payment of
taxes from rival authorities in top producer Ivory Coast.
 An Ivorian trade body loyal to incumbent leader Laurent
Gbagbo has threatened sanctions including jail terms against
cocoa exporters who delay shipments or fail to pay taxes by
March 31, a letter showed.
 However, the rival government of Alassane Ouattara, widely
recognised by the international community as the winner of a
Nov. 28 election, warned exporters against cooperating with the
pro-Gbagbo committee, saying they face sanctions from his
administration if they do.
 Ouattara's government said the head of the pro-Gbagbo body,
Anoh N'Guessan, had been dismissed and had no right to act in
its name.
 ""Volumes of cocoa subject to these procedures should be
shipped by April 15, 2011, at the latest,"" said the letter to
exporters from the Coffee and Cocoa Management Committee, dated
Feb. 9 and signed by N'Guessan.
 It added that exporters in Ivory Coast, which accounts for
roughly one third of world supplies, were obliged to pay all
their taxes by March 31 at the latest. Exporters include major
international trading houses such as Olam and Cargill.
 ""Any trader who contributes to or is inclined towards not
respecting the above regulations exposes himself to sanctions
prescribed by Ivorian law,"" it said.
 Justin Kone Katinan, Gbagbo's budget minister, said, ""The
law gives us powers to (collect the taxes.) All we have to do is
apply the law. We have foreseen all this.""
 The minister also issued a warning to smugglers of cocoa.
 ""The first exporter who is registered here and is caught
involved in parallel exportation will be stripped of his
licence, arrested and sent to prison for complicity with an
armed group,"" he said.
 Ouattara has placed a one-month ban on cocoa exports that
most exporters are observing.
 Fears that Ouattara may extend his export ban, have helped
push cocoa futures to one-year highs.
 ICE May cocoa futures were up $18 to $3,391 per tonne on
Friday.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell and world
stocks rose modestly on Friday after Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak stepped down following more than two weeks of popular
unrest that roiled financial markets.
 Prices of gold and U.S. Treasury bonds erased some of their
gains as Mubarak's departure partially revived investors'
appetite for risk. Many were still concerned, however, about
the transfer of power in Egypt and potential new uprisings in
other Middle Eastern countries impacting oil prices.
 The uncertainty kept the U.S. dollar strong against other
major currencies. Also supporting the greenback was data
showing the U.S. economic recovery is gaining traction.
 ""Initially you'll see a pop in the market and oil come off
on the hope that this prevents violence in the streets of
Egypt. But as we go forward, we'll start wondering what's next
for the country,"" said Jay Suskind, senior vice president at
Duncan-Williams in Jersey City.
 Mubarak ceded power to a military council, which will run
the affairs of the Arab world's most populous nation. A free
and fair presidential election has been promised for September.
For details, see [ID:nLDE7192NZ].
 U.S. crude oil  prices, which had been rising on
fears of potential disruptions in supply from the Middle East,
fell $1.18, or 1.36 percent, to $85.55 per barrel.
 Key U.S. stock indexes erased early losses to trade with
modest gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was nearly flat at
12,229.82 while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose
1.77 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,323.64. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> climbed 5.96 points, or 0.21 percent, to
2,796.41.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed 0.41 percent higher. MSCI's benchmark All-Country
World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> was little changed at 340.83
points.
 ""It looks like the stock market is taking the news well,""
said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist with Wells Fargo in
St. Louis.
 ""One thing that has weighed on investor sentiment is that
the price of oil would go up in the case of political turmoil,
and Mubarak's leaving reduces that possibility.""
 Despite a slight return in risk appetite, the dollar kept
gains. It was rising 0.46 percent against a basket of major
currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>. Against
the Japanese yen, it  rose 0.29 percent to 83.50.
 A survey showing U.S. consumer sentiment rose to its
highest level in eight months in early February also supported
the greenback as it suggested the U.S. economic recovery was on
track. Stronger economic growth may eventually translate into
higher Treasuries yields and boost the appeal of the dollar.
 The euro  fell 0.61 percent to $1.351, also pressured
by a fresh bout of concerns about the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis.
 ""There are bigger things driving the euro right now,"" said
Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""The concerns most heavily weighing on the euro -- the
ongoing debt crisis -- are still there, and for now, the
downside is still in play,"" he said.
 U.S Treasury prices shed some gains after Mubarak's
resignation, but benchmark 10-year notes  were still
up 15/32 in price, with the yield at 3.6457 percent.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against
the euro on Friday, shaking off a brief dip after Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak stepped down as investors have widely
priced in his exit and technical factors weighed on the single
currency.
 The euro, which hit a three-week low against the dollar on
Friday, has tried to break the $1.35 level twice before and
failed, shifting momentum to the downside.
 In addition, the recent spate of U.S. economic data has
been supportive of the greenback and most strategists are
looking for more outperformance on the dollar.
 ""It was a kneejerk reaction and it didn't last because
there are bigger things driving the euro right now,"" said Brian
Dolan, chief currency strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster,
New Jersey.
 ""Egypt is now seen as a regional political drama and the
market seems to think the risk of a fundamentalist takeover
there is overblown. But the concerns most heavily weighing on
the euro -- the ongoing debt crisis -- are still there, and for
now, the downside is still in play,"" he said.
 In midday New York trading, the euro fell 0.4 percent to
trade at $1.3540, after earlier hitting $1.3502 -- its lowest
since Jan. 21. Key support for the euro lies at $1.3500, a
point that traders cited as an options barrier, with reports of
strong bids ahead of that level.
 Technical analysts said if the pair closes below the euro's
100-day moving average at $1.3542, it would be the first time
since Jan. 17. As a result, the single euro zone currency could
see further downside.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, which measures the
greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, was up
0.3 percent at 78.522.
 Traders said the European Central Bank stepped in to buy
Portuguese bonds after yields on the country's debt hit
euro-era highs. The latest spike in yields has sparked fresh
concerns about funding costs in peripheral euro zone
economies.
 Bond yields have also been driving the price in
euro/dollar, with spreads between two-year U.S. Treasuries
catching up to their Bund counterparts, supporting the
greenback, said Andrew Busch, global currency strategist at BMO
Capital Markets in Chicago.
 He said the two-year U.S. Treasury/Bund spread peaked in
late January at around 89 basis points, but has since narrowed
to 60 basis points or less, which Busch said was a big deal.
 The dollar, meanwhile, touched its highest level in a month
at 83.68 yen, boosted by the rising trend in U.S. Treasury
yields. It was last up 0.3 percent at 83.51 yen. Some analysts
said the spike in yields reflects a U.S. economy on a more
footing.
 The dollar also made headway against the Swiss franc,
rising to a one-month high at 0.9750 on demand from a Swiss
bank. The franc was further undermined on weaker-than-expected
Swiss inflation data released Thursday.
 The dollar was last at 0.9762, up 0.7 percent.

 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied and oil
prices fell on Friday after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
stepped down, bowing to escalating pressure from the military
and protesters.
 Prices of gold and U.S. Treasury bonds partly erased early
gains as Mubarak's departure partially revived investors'
appetite for risk. The U.S. dollar briefly pared gains, but
remained strong against a basket of major currencies.

 ""One thing that has weighed on investor sentiment is that

 Key U.S. stock indexes opened lower on concerns about the
continuous unrest in Egypt, a longtime U.S. ally in the Middle
East. On Thursday, Mubarak disappointed protesters and
investors by holding on to power.
 Equities rose later as news of his resignation was
announced by the Egyptian vice president on television.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 15.67
points, or 0.13 percent, at 12,244.96, while the Standard &

 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top

 U.S. crude oil prices  fell 30 cents, or 0.35
percent, to $86.43 per barrel, while spot gold prices 
erased part of its gains, but were still up 0.19 percent at
$1,364.00.
 U.S Treasury prices also shed some gains, but the benchmark
10-year notes  were still up 22/32 in price, with
the yield at 3.6194 percent.

(Recasts with Weber leaving Bundesbank)
 By Noah Barkin and Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Axel Weber will step down as head
of the Bundesbank a year before his term ends, the German
government said on Friday, formally ending his chances of
becoming the next president of the European Central Bank.
 Reuters reported on Wednesday that Weber planned to remove
himself from consideration for the top ECB post held by
Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet and leave the Bundesbank early,
but Friday's statement was the first official confirmation.
 ""Bundesbank president Axel Weber told German Chancellor
Angela Merkel that he would like to step down on April 30, 2011
at the end of his seventh year in office,"" government spokesman
Steffen Siebert told Reuters.
 ""The chancellor and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble took
note of his decision with respect for his personal reasons,"" he
added, without elaborating. ""A successor will be communicated
during the course of the next week.""
 The Bundesbank confirmed his departure.
 The 53-year old Weber, an inflation-fighting monetary ""hawk""
who left a meeting with Merkel and Schaeuble in the chancellery
on Friday without speaking to reporters, was widely seen as the
frontrunner to replace Trichet when his term ends in October.
 His withdrawal has thrown the ECB race wide open and fed
unease in financial markets about the ability of divided
European policymakers to solve the euro zone's sovereign debt
crisis.
 The ECB has played a crucial role in responding to the
crisis, buying the bonds of debt-stricken peripheral euro zone
countries as part of a concerted push to calm markets. Weber's
public criticism of that decision may have cost him the top job.
 The Frankfurt-based central bank stepped into the markets
for the first time in two weeks on Thursday to buy Portuguese
bonds, traders said, after yields hit euro-era highs on concerns
about perceived slow progress on solving the year-long debt
crisis.
 
 ITALY BACKS DRAGHI
 Earlier, Schaeuble suggested that Germany could accept a
non-German in the prestigious ECB post, but told reporters that
the priority was agreeing a ""comprehensive package"" to help stem
the bloc's debt woes.
 ""Germany has never insisted that the next ECB president be a
German,"" Schaeuble said after talks with the French economy
minister and French central bank chief.
 ""We now want to solve the question of institutional reform
in the Eurogroup,"" he said. ""Once that is solved we will discuss
the question of who is the best candidate (for the ECB).""
 Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said Europe should
find the most competent person for the job independent of their
nationality, but also described his countryman Mario Draghi, the
Bank of Italy governor, as an ""excellent"" candidate.
 Weber's withdrawal is a blow to Merkel's drive to secure the
ECB post for a German and could raise pressure on her to impose
tough German-style fiscal rules on euro zone partners to satisfy
voters in a year of seven state elections.
 The news comes ahead of two crucial summits -- on March 11
and March 24-25 -- at which European leaders want to agree a
comprehensive package to resolve the debt crisis.
 Germany and France want their ""competitiveness pact"" to be
part of the broader package, in return for agreeing to
strengthen a 440 billion euro bailout fund.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said Paris would
try to incorporate one proposal in that pact -- a German-style
""debt brake"" imposing strict limits on issuing government debt.
 ""In the coming months, before the end of 2011, we will look
into incorporating in the constitution rules that permanently
secure a balanced budget,"" she said.
 Leaders from the 17-nation euro zone are expected to approve
a successor to Trichet by summer and will take their cue from
Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 Italy is pushing the candidacy of Draghi but other
contenders include Luxembourg's Yves Mersch and Finnish central
Bank chief Erkki Liikanen, a monetary policy moderate.
 The leading contenders to replace Weber at the Bundesbank
include Jens Weidmann, Merkel's economic adviser, and ECB
executive board member Juergen Stark.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2011 10:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-EU issues pesticide alert on Argentine sorghum cargo," * Feed makers in big producer Spain concerned over supplies
 * Spain industry says only one batch affected so far
 * Sorghum cheaper feed grain than sky-high wheat
 
 (Adds details of EU pesticide limits)
 By Charlie Dunmore and Martin Roberts
 BRUSSELS/MADRID, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Dutch authorities have
confirmed that a shipment of sorghum unloaded in Rotterdam from
Argentina and destined for use as animal feed was contaminated
with the pesticide dichlorvos, an EU-wide alert showed.
 It is possible the tainted feed has already been distributed
to the market in the Netherlands and Germany, the European
Union's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) showed.
 The alert follows a separate warning issued by German
officials to European Union farmers last month that feed had
been tainted with the toxic chemical dioxin and fed to hens and
pigs, contaminating eggs, poultry meat and pork at affected
farms.
 The dioxin contamination hit wider sales of German eggs and
meat and led to a protest by thousands in Berlin in late
January. Animal feed makers in Spain, home to Europe's
biggest feed industry, said they were concerned that the
dichlorvos alert could damage imports to Europe of raw materials
at a time when their prices were already at 2-1/2-year highs.
 ""The consequences for food security would have to be
evaluated, as we are not today aware any batch has entered the
food chain or more than one batch is affected,"" Spanish feed
compounders' association Cesfac said in an internal report seen
by Reuters.
 Cesfac said the tainted sorghum had been delivered to a feed
factory in Germany, where the insecticide had been detected
during an in-house check.
 ""The said manufacturer has made a formal complaint to the
provider for not complying with product quality. The merchant
has traced this batch to a sorghum ship, which contained 30,000
tonnes, or Argentine origin,"" it said, adding the sorghum had
been unloaded in Rotterdam.
 The RASFF alert said 0.623 parts per million (ppm) of
dichlorvos had been found in the sorghum. 
 A European Commission spokesperson said the insecticide was
not authorised in the EU, so a maximum residue level of 0.01 ppm
was applicable by default.
 The spokesman said, however, that the compound feed made
using the sorghum had itself been within allowable limits of the
insecticide and therefore it had been released onto the market.
 
 SORGHUM CHEAPER THAN WHEAT
 Spain needs to import upwards of 10 million tonnes of grain
every year because farmers cannot grow enough to meet demand in
the country's harsh climate and poor soil.
 Like several countries in Europe, Spain has recently been
importing the feed grain sorghum to provide a cheaper
alternative to wheat, which is trading on world markets at its
highest levels since August 2008.
 Farmers across the 27-country EU bloc say many are deeply in
the red after a surge in feed costs, largely driven by bad
weather and worries of food inflation, and fear herds will
shrink and many farms fall into disuse in the coming months.
 Cesfac noted that Spanish imports of sorghum so far in the
2010/11 market year came from the United States.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2011 09:52AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Earnings and price worries on display," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - There is no shortage of market
moving events for investors in the coming week -- from Egypt
unrest to inflation data -- but the biggest shape-shifter would
be a continuation of the recent burst of disappointing earnings.
 Equity markets were rattled in the past week by a series of
corporate reports that ran counter to the widespread view that
all is well with revenues and profits, with some firms starting
to struggle with rising cost pressures and wary consumers.
 Focus will fall on a heavy European schedule that includes
the likes of Barclays, AXA, BNP Paribas and Volvo.
 The past week saw investment bank Credit Suisse and leading
spirits group Diageo miss expectations, while U.S. tech giant
Cisco Systems Inc beat projections but with disappointing
margins.
 European companies, in particular, are having a hard time
meeting the market expectations set for them.
 Data from Thomson Reuters StarMine shows that with a third
of STOXX 600 quarterly reporting done, 54 percent of companies
have missed analysts' target. It compared with only 25 percent
for the U.S. S&P 500.
Colin McLean, chief investment officer of SVM Asset
Management, said most of the weakness has been related to
consumer sentiment and rising prices.
 This will mean investors look beyond the bottom line to
underlying pressures.
 ""It will be more than the actual result, (instead) looking
at the impact of oil prices and food prices,"" he said.
 All of which means that the coming week's inflation and
growth data, along with a G20 meeting at the end of the week,
plus continuing questions about Egypt and the Middle East,
threaten to make markets skittish.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 ALL ABOUT PRICES
 A quick glance at the performances of various asset classes
so far this year, points to how inflation expectations have come
to dominate some investor thinking.
 Among the top gainers is the S&P GSCI soft commodities index
, which has a total return of nearly 11 percent, reflecting the
rising cost of food.
 At the other end of the scale, however, is MSCI's emerging
market stock benchmark, which has lost more than 5 percent. Some
of this is because of the impact of food price rises on emerging
market inflation and the potential for monetary tightening as a
result.
It is not only impacting emerging markets, of course. The end
of the past week saw German consumer inflation revised upwards
along with a spike in wholesale prices, and British producer
prices surging.
 Oil rising above $101 a barrel on Friday as a result of the
tumult in Egypt will have done nothing to ease investor
concerns.
 The coming week brings consumer inflation data for China,
the United States, and Britain, where the Bank of England's
inflation report will also be released.
 The bank held interest rates steady at its meeting in the
past week, but it is considered one of the most likely of the
big economies to begin a tightening cycle. The report will be
parsed for clues to whether the market has been right to price
in a UK base rate rise in May.
 Inflation, meanwhile, is putting Group of 20 finance
ministers and central bankers, meeting in Paris at the end of
the week, under pressure to come up with a coordinated response
rather than risk a piecemeal tightening of monetary policy.
 Their ability to do so will be a major driver of where
investors see the relative value in bonds and currencies in
coming weeks.

 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday, and
looked to stay firm next week, as investors sought safety in
the currency after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak refused to
step down despite more than two weeks of massive protests.
 The euro, a currency sensitive to the Egypt unrest, fell
for a second straight day against the dollar and traded below
its 100-day moving average around $1.3542. It hit a three-week
low on $1.3505 on electronic trading platform EBS.
 Key support for the euro lies at $1.3500, a point that
traders cited as an options barrier, with reports of strong
bids ahead of that level.
 Other currencies that thrive in a risk-seeking environment
such as the Australian dollar and British sterling fell, even
as Mubarak's vow to delegate powers to his vice president. On
Friday, Al Arabiya TV reported that Mubarak and his family had
left Cairo and may have gone to the Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh.
 ""It's all about risk today, and the dollar as a result is
getting some safe-haven bids. A lot of this has to do with
Egyptian unrest,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of North American
FX strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""The market's anticipation that Mubarak will step down has
not been fulfilled. In a way, what's happening in the market is
a slight echo of that Friday a few weeks ago when the Egyptian
situation first became prominent.""
 In early New York trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index,
which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of
currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 78.554.
 The euro shed 0.5 percent to trade at $1.3528. Technical
analysts said if the pair closes below the euro's 100-day
moving average at $1.3542, it would be the first time since
Jan. 17. As a result, the single euro zone currency could see
further downside.
 Traders said the European Central Bank stepped in to buy
Portuguese bonds after yields on the country's debt hit
euro-era highs.. The latest spike in yields has sparked fresh
concerns about funding costs in peripheral euro zone nations.
 The dollar touched its highest level in a month at 83.68
yen, boosted by the rising trend in U.S. Treasury yields. It
was last up 0.2 percent at 83.44.
 Traders cited a expiring significant dollar/yen options
contract for Friday's New York cutoff at 84.00 yen, with more
sizable interest at the same level also reported to come on
Monday.
 U.S. Treasury yields have spiked this month, shoring up the
dollar as improving data supported the view a U.S. economic
recovery was on more solid ground.
 ""The focus is on interest rates and the U.S. has lagged
behind most, especially the euro zone,"" said Paul Robson,
currency strategist at RBS Global Banking.
 ""The improvement in the labor market bodes well for the
dollar, while for the euro there is a risk of disappointment as
peripheral debt problems return.""
 The dollar also made headway against the Swiss franc,
rising to a one-month high at 0.9750 on demand from a Swiss
bank. The franc was further undermined on
weaker-than-expected Swiss inflation data released Thursday.
The dollar was last at 0.9727, up 0.4 percent.

 * Volatile liquidity means unpredictable borrowing rates
 * Solution to problem of persistent borrowers not in sight
 * Banking reform, end of ECB support key to normalisation
 By William James
 LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The euro zone banking system has
shown signs it can wean itself off the ECB's life support loans
but while interbank rates are volatile and funding for weaker
banks troublesome, money market 'normality' is a long way off.
 Demand for the European Central Bank's unlimited fixed-rate
loans -- designed to keep banks lending to each other in
stressed markets -- has fallen, pushing bank-to-bank lending
rates back to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis
brought money market activity shuddering to a halt.
 The value of the ECB's lending to banks shrank to 450
billion euros in January, its lowest since October 2008 and down
from a peak of over 900 billion euros in June 2010.
 ""The fact that liquidity is going down week after week is
certainly an encouraging sign ... but it doesn't tell you the
full picture,"" said Unicredit rate strategist Luca Cazzulani.
 Competition for a smaller surplus of liquidity and large
weekly swings in ECB borrowing have seen the cost of overnight
borrowing surge and the path of rates become volatile.
 Throughout January's ECB maintenance period -- the timeframe
over which banks are required to keep a set amount of cash at
the central bank -- the overnight Eonia rate varied by almost a
full percentage point, between 0.347 percent and 1.318 percent.
By comparison, in the first three months of 2007, Eonia moved an
average of 12 basis points over the course of a reserve period.
 With a vast array of financial lending instruments pegged to
Eonia, this volatility makes funding decisions costly and
difficult throughout the wider lending markets.
""If the Eonia remains volatile you will keep seeing treasury
managers having very hard times making right decisions,""
Cazzulani said. ""In the end if that incurs a cost, it means the
cost of funding for a bank increases and someone eventually will
have to pay.""
 
 HOOKED ON ECB LIQUIDITY
 The structural problems underlying the money market are
highlighted by 'addicted' banks who are unable to find willing
lenders in the market and have become reliant on ECB funds.
 The bulk of serial borrowers are believed to lie in the euro
zone's embattled peripheral states, Greece, Portugal and
Ireland, where sovereign concerns have exacerbated difficulties.
 These three countries account for 48 percent of the total
borrowing from the ECB, despite representing just 8.6 percent of
the euro zone banking system by assets, Barclays Capital said.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has expressed his
determination to tackle the problem of dependent banks, but the
tools at the ECB's disposal are limited.
 With the central bank applying pressure to end persistent
borrowing, much of the decline in excess liquidity demand can be
attributed to banks able to deleverage more easily -- leaving a
core of persistent demand that is more difficult to eliminate.
 ""It sounds easy in theory to deleverage but if it was that
easy (these banks) probably would have done it by now ... we
just don't know what assets they are holding,"" said Peter
Shaffrik, head of rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 Recent data showed Portuguese banks' borrowing from the ECB
in January had not fallen from December's 41 billion euros.

 HURDLES ON NORMALISATION PATH
 A real return to the less dysfunctional and more stable
money markets seen before the 2008 crisis of confidence between
lenders requires more than just lower surplus liquidity.
 ""The very holistic answer is that you need to fix the
banking system,"" Shaffrik said.
 A more consolidated system of banks with improved
capitalisation is seen as key for the resumption of interbank
lending to the distressed regions of the euro zone.
 Spain is seen as leading the way on banking sector reforms
to address the problems doggings its 'caja' savings banks, but
elsewhere reform is proving more difficult and slow.
 Once markets are assured this process is underway, the ECB
will be able to regain control of the money supply by ending its
offer of unlimited funding, and returning to a system of
variable-rate tenders with a fixed amount of funds on offer.
 ""As long as the ECB is not controlling the supply of
liquidity, rather than the banks themselves, you will always be
quite volatile in terms of liquidity conditions and also in
terms of rates,"" said Commerzbank strategist Christoph Reiger.
 Withdrawal of liquidity measures will be in focus at the
ECB's March 3 meeting, with Trichet expected to say if the bank
judges the time is right for a gradual move toward the exit.

 * Imports to rise sharply after tariff falls to $50/T
 * Imports in 2011 seen down from 2010
 * Domestic prices keep declining on low demand
 
 By Aleksandras Budrys
 MOSCOW, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Russia's raw sugar imports are
expected to decline in February from the previous month but then
rise sometime in the new few months after a cut in import
tariffs, the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies (IKAR)
said.
 The think-tank said in a monthly sugar review on Friday that
102,000 tonnes may be imported to Russia in February, of which
65,000 tonnes are already being unloaded, down from 150,000
tonnes in January.
 ""Besides this volume, 483,000 tonnes of Brazilian raws are
set to be shipped to Black Sea (ports), most of which will reach
Russia in February-March,"" it said. 
 ""The bulk of this volume, as well as no less than 150,000
tonnes of already unloaded raws will be cleared by the customs
after the $50 per tonne tariff becomes effective.""
 The Russian government has proposed an early cut in the raw
sugar import tariff to $50 per tonne from $140 -- in March
rather than in May.
 The proposal came after a severe drought caused a spike in
Russian food prices, pushing up annual inflation to 8.8 percent
in 2010 versus the government's original target of 6-7 percent,
data showed last month.
 But the new tariff has to be approved by Russia's partners
in a customs union, Belarus and Kazakhstan, to become effective.
 The customs union's executive commission sets the tariff
before the 15th of every month for the following month and bases
its rate on the average New York price of the preceding month.
So far the commission has made no announcement.
 IKAR forecasts that Russia's raw sugar imports will decline
to 1.9 million tonnes this year from 2.1 million in 2010, with
the bulk of shipments taking place before July. It expects a
record output of domestic beet sugar of 4.2 million tonnes.
 IKAR's estimate is in line with the forecast by the Russian
Sugar Producers' Union, the industry lobby which expects beet
sugar output to exceed 4 million tonnes this year.
 ""Imports may be even lower if there are sales of
intervention sugar between the end of February through May,""
IKAR's analyst Yevgeny Ivanov told Reuters.
 Russia's state reserve Rosrezerv plans to supply 300,000
tonnes of sugar to the domestic market next month in order to
suppress prices following the summer drought.
 Russian sugar prices have been on the decline for about a
month, currently reaching 34,500-34,600 roubles ($1,177-1,180)
per tonne in Krasnodar, and may decline further due to weak
demand, Ivanov said.
 ""There is no deficit of sugar in most regions,"" IKAR said.

 * But more-liquid market make Hungarian assets a better bet
 * Hungary deficit reduction package still key
 
 By Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Emerging Europe's two main
economies to receive IMF bailouts, Hungary and Romania, are
taking starkly different approaches towards recovery, but the
latter's pursuit of orthodox policy is failing to woo investors.
 Even with most economists skeptical of Budapest's focus on
stimulating demand rather than cutting budget flab, analysts say
the draw of relatively high bond yields and its more liquid
markets is keeping investors in play for now.
 Romania's path to growth of 4.0-4.5 percent in 2012 -- a
cost-cutting campaign sanctioned by the International Monetary
Fund -- looks more convincing, they say. But its markets are
still so small that investors in central and eastern Europe do
not feel obliged to get involved.
 ""They are both trying to tackle fiscal problems by taking
different approaches. But the market realities are also very
different,"" said Barclay's Capital strategist Koon Chow.
 ""They've got different debt, liquidity benchmark inflows,
and differ in how policymakers in Romania have been able to
control nearly every element of the market by intervention and
by not selling bonds above a certain yield.""
 The IMF forecasts Hungary's growth next year at just 3
percent, but right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban is aiming
for 5 percent, having shunned IMF advice to cut public spending
that makes up 50 percent of the economy.
 Despite its debt carrying ""junk"" ratings status Romanian CDS
prices to insure against default were $260,260 per $10 million
in debt on Friday, while Hungary, which is rated one notch above
that, was priced a more risky $275,730. 
 But the forint currency has outperformed Romania's leu,
rising 2 percent this year versus a fall of 0.7 percent.

* For a story on Hungary's pro-growth strategy: [ID:nLDE70N0B9]

 
 PRO-GROWTH?
 The IMF and the European Commission bailed out Hungary and
Romania at the height of the crisis with two 20 billion euro
emergency aid packages that called for painful austerity to cut
debt and put the countries on a path towards sustainable growth.
 While Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc is struggling to
stick to that advice by cutting pensions, state wages, and other
costs, Orban chose not to extend his IMF deal and is funding
spending and tax cuts with levies on big business and the
""renationalisation"" of some $14 billion in pension funds. 
 There is a chance he could meet his 5-percent growth target,
helped by a boost for manufacturing when an 800 million euro
Daimler AG  comes on line in 2012 and an Audi plant
finishes a smaller but similar expansion a year later.
 But the IMF and Hungary's former budget council -- disbanded
by Orban last year -- both forecast growth falling well short
and the IMF sees the budget deficit ballooning to more than 7
percent of GDP as a result.
 This month, the Fund recommended Budapest cut spending by
about 4 percent of GDP because, at about half of the entire
economy, Hungary's public spending is much larger than in its
regional peers. It also said Orban's tax cuts may undercut
domestic demand, leading to weaker than expected tax income.
 ""The government's strategy is risky as it needs the
otherwise costly tax cuts to trigger a strong response in
economic activity, which may not materialize,"" the IMF said
earlier this month.
 
 WAIT AND SEE
 In the short term, however, investors say the extra taxes
and pension grab mean Hungary can finance itself at least this
year, alleviating at least some worry that Orban will take the
country backwards with unsustainable budget policies.
 The market is now watching for details of a three-year,
600-650 billion forint ($2.98-$3.23 billion) deficit reduction
plan pledged by his government to address those fears.
 After a series of communication missteps, investors are
skittish, and this week bond yields rose and the forint stumbled
when media reported the cabinet government was struggling to
find areas for spending cuts -- worth some 2 to 3 percent of GDP
-- meant to make up two thirds of the package. [ID:nLDE7190XY]
 ""If the government does not deliver, then the market might
take another point of view from the one they've been taking so
far,"" said BNP Paribas strategist Elisabeth Gruie.
 But the strategists still saw most market players preferring
Hungary over Romania, whose smaller markets have little
participation from foreign investors and fewer assets to buy.
 The Romanian central bank intervened to keep the currency in
a tight band of around 4.1-4.3 per euro last year and the
government frequently baulks at selling debt at high yields,
reducing opportunities to dip in.
 ""People give Hungary the benefit of the doubt because it's
quite an actively traded market. People expect a bit of a helter
skelter ride there,"" said Nigel Rendell, a strategist at RBC.
 ""They are prepared to live with that because if you look at
the yields, they are 6 percent, versus 3.5 for Poland, and you
get a little more return... For Romania, it's going to take a
couple more years to come good.""

379,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2011 08:40AM ET</span>","US trade gap widens in Dec, swells 33 pct in 2010"," WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit
widened in December to its highest level in four months, the
U.S. government said on Friday in a report that also showed
the annual trade gap expanded nearly 33 percent in 2010 as
imports from China hit record levels.
 The December trade deficit grew nearly 6 percent to $40.6
billion, just slightly higher than a consensus estimate of
Wall Street analysts as the average price for imported oil
leapt to its highest level since October 2008.
 Overall imports of goods and services were also their
highest since October 2008, in a sign that consumers and
businesses are spending more as the U.S. economy picks up
steam.
 Exports of goods and services were the highest since July
2008, the month that they hit their peak before beginning a
precipitious drop caused by the global financial crisis.
 U.S. goods exports to China grew to a record $10.1 billion
in December and also were a record $91.9 billion for the year.
 But that strong finish was swamped by record U.S. imports
from China of $364.9 billion for the entire year, which pushed
the closely watched trade gap with that country to a record
$273.1 billion.
 Rising oil prices also helped widen the U.S. trade deficit
in 2010. The average price for imported oil jumped to $74.66
per barrel, from $56.93 in 2009.
 Imports of consumer goods and foods, feeds and beverages
also set records in 2010.
 Overall, U.S. imports of goods and services grew 19.7
percent in 2010 to $2.33 trillion dollars.
 U.S. exports grew 16.6 percent to $1.83 trillion, a pace
that if maintained would allow the United States to reach
President Barack Obama's goal of doubling exports by 2013.
 U.S. exports of services, industrial supplies, consumer
goods and petroleum all set records.
 The strong services performance pushed the U.S. trade
surplus for services to a record $148.7 billion in 2010.

(Corrects to replace the word imports with stocks in first and
11th paragraphs)	
 By Neil Chatterjee	
 JAKARTA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia ordered a government
agency on Wednesday to boost stocks by a third in the latest
sign that governments concerned about rising food prices and
dwindling supplies are rushing into the market and could drive
inflation even higher. 
 Global food prices have climbed to record highs on shrinking
supplies of wheat, corn, soybean and oilseeds. While rice has
been less of a worry thanks to ample supplies in the top two
exporters, Thailand and Vietnam, traders said other Asian
governments may soon seek to boost rice stocks too.	
 Adding to gathering nervousness among governments over food
supplies, China plans subsidies to boost grain output this year,
state radio said in a report on its website.	
 ""Maintaining a stable grain output increase has a very
important meaning to managing inflation expectations,
stabilizing general consumer prices, and realising rapid and
stable economic growth as well as social harmony and stability,""
the report said, citing a regular state council meeting held by
Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday. 
 The impact of Cyclone Yasi in Australia has exacerbated food
worries. The chairman of Australia's main sugar industry group
Canegrowers said up to a quarter of the sugar cane crop in the
state of Queensland may have been lost.	
 ""Given there has been such a wide area of impact from this
cyclone, we are looking at losses on the outer edges of 5 to 10
percent and close to the centre of the cyclone up to 50 percent
of the crop could be lost,"" Alf Cristaudo told Reuters in an
interview. 
 The latest monthly grains report from the U.S. government
threatened to further stoke concerns over crops being
increasingly used for fuel. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
slashed its forecast for corn stockpiles 9 percent, projecting
the tightest supply since the Great Depression as a record
amount of the crop is used to make ethanol. 
 Problems with Australia's wheat crop as well as lingering
effects of last summer's drought in the Black Sea region have
boosted the role of the United States on the export market.	
 In January, global food prices tracked by the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organisation hit their highest level on
record. The FAO said last week its Food Price Index rose for the
seventh month in a row to reach 231 in January, the highest
level since records began in 1990.	
 The rising prices have raised concerns over inflation,
protectionism and social unrest, factors behind the 2008 food
crisis, and prodded the G20 to promise action. 
 
 
 
 WILL RICE PRICES SURGE TOO? 
 Indonesia's government met to discuss food security on
Wednesday. Chief Economic Minister Hatta Rajasa asked state
procurement agency Bulog to gradually boost rice stockpiles to 2
million tonnes from the current 1.5 million tonnes, underlining
fears shortages could cause price spikes. 
 Traders said other governments may also look to increase
stocks despite ample supplies in Thailand and Vietnam.	
 Bangladesh said it was buying 200,000 tonnes of parboiled
rice from Thailand in their first government-to-government deal
for the grain. 
 The Philippines, however, held back on importing more
despite a recommendation by a government panel to build stocks
above a 1 million tonne target. 
 Traders also warned of a remote chance the top two
exporters, facing food inflation pressures as well, may choose
to keep more supplies at home.	
 ""Rising supply from the world's top two exporters is likely
to weigh prices down. However, there could be steady demand from
traditional buyers such as the Middle East, African countries
and demand elsewhere in Asia that could help support prices,""
said Kiattisak Kallayasirivat of trading firm Novel Agritrade. 
 Indonesia surprised markets last month by buying nearly five
times as much rice as expected, then suspended rice import
duties, signalling it could look to stockpile more.	
 Its import plans are a turnaround from minimal purchases
last year and show efforts by Southeast Asia's biggest economy
to be self-sufficient in rice have not succeeded. 
 Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called on
people to start planting food at home, and told the World
Economic Forum in Davos the next economic war could be over the
race for scarce resources, due to growing populations.	
 Food price inflation led the central bank to hike interest
rates last week for the first time in two years, and protests
over food prices were seen as a major factor in the ousting of
Indonesia's autocratic President Suharto in 1998.	
 By contrast in the Philippines, policymakers appear not to
be overly worried about rising food costs. The central bank is
expected to leave policy rates unchanged at a record low on
Thursday, and has said there is no evidence that commodity
prices are spilling over into the broader economy.	
 The country may buy less than 1 million tonnes of rice this
year despite a government panel recommendation for a higher
purchase volume, with forecasts of a good first quarter crop, a
government official said.	
 Early rains this year have helped rice crops and along with
hefty stockpiles from previous years' imports, gives Manila --
the world's biggest buyer in recent years -- room to buy less
than the record 2.45 million tonnes it purchased last year. 
 ""We are preventing over-importation because our farmers will
be disadvantaged,"" said agriculture secretary Proceso Alcala.	
 Thai rice rose to $545 per tonne from last week's $540 per
tonne on the back of loading demand after exporters committed
last month to sell 820,000 tonnes of rice to Indonesia.	
 Benchmark Thai 100 percent B-grade white rice prices
 are likely to rise to $550 a tonne by the end of
February and $567.5 a tonne in March from around $540 a tonne
now, given expectations of additional orders from Indonesia,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, a Reuters poll shows. 
 Rice lagged other staple grains last year, falling 13
percent while corn and wheat surged around 50 percent. Rice
prices have only gained 2 percent this year and are far below a
record $1,050 a tonne hit in 2008.	
 Still, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao sees Thai white
rice rising into a range of $630-$673 per tonne over the next
three months based on chart indicators. 
 Some traders say rice prices could drop in the coming weeks
on increased supply because Vietnam is due to start harvesting
its major winter-spring rice crop by end-February. 
 ""Prices will fall in March as there are no more government
deals while the Philippines has not detailed its importing plan
but it may buy less than last year,"" one said.	
 Thailand is also about to start harvesting its second crop,
expected to be around 9.5 million tonnes, the highest ever and
well above 8.8 million tonnes last year.

(updates prices, adds quote, detail)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday following
a new bout of market jitters over the euro zone's sovereign debt
problems, while the dollar struck a one-month high against the
yen after data underscored recovery in the U.S. jobs market.
 U.S. Treasury yields have spiked this month, shoring up the
dollar while improving data has supported the view that economic
recovery in the United States is on more durable ground.
 Data on Thursday showed new applications for unemployment
benefits dropped to a 2-1/2 year low last week, consistent with
other indicators suggesting a strengthening labour market.
 ""The focus is on interest rates and the U.S. has lagged
behind most especially the euro zone,"" said Paul Robson,
currency strategist at RBS Global Banking.
 ""The improvement in the labour market bodes well for the
dollar while for the euro, there is a risk of disappointment as
peripheral debt problems return.""
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance
against a basket of currencies, was up 0.5 percent at 78.640.
The dollar touched its highest level in a month at 83.60 yen to
trade up 0.3 percent on the day.
 Traders highlighted a chunky dollar/yen expiry for Friday's
New York cut at 84.00 yen, with more sizeable interest at the
same level also reported to come on Monday.
 The dollar also benefited from safe-haven flows after
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak refused to step down as had been
expected, keeping alive the risk of a possible showdown between
protestors and the military and more political chaos in the
Middle East..
 
 DEBT WORRIES DOG EURO
 The euro remained under pressure against the dollar after
falling the previous day, weighed down by renewed jitters about
the euro zone debt crisis and waning expectations that the
European Central Bank will raise interest rates soon.
 The euro shed 0.5 percent to trade at $1.3518, falling below
its 100-day moving average around $1.3541. Technical analysts
say a daily close below this level for the first time since Jan.
17 could see further downside.
 Next support was seen at this week's low just ahead of
$1.3500, where an option barrier was reportedly being protected
by strong bids.
 Traders said the European Central Bank stepped in to buy
Portuguese bonds after yields on the country's debt hit euro-era
highs.. The latest spike in yields has sparked fresh concerns
about funding costs in the euro zone periphery.
 ""Portugal faces a huge round of debt redemptions in April
and with current yields on Portuguese debt holding just below
post-euro creation highs it is not unreasonable to fear that
Portugal may need some sort of financial support this spring,""
said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
 ""The next few months therefore promise to be testing times
for the European Union and the euro.""
 Traders will also keep an eye on a meeting between
Bundesbank President Axel Weber and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel to discuss his future after the leaked disclosure of his
withdrawal from the ECB presidency race hit markets..
 The rebounding dollar also made headway against the Swiss
franc, rising to a one-month high on demand from a Swiss bank,
with the franc staying pressured by weaker-than-expected Swiss
inflation data released on Thursday.
 The Australian dollar lost 0.6 percent to $0.9979, having
come under pressure after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor
Glenn Stevens said it was reasonable to expect rates to be on
hold for some time.
 U.S. trade data for December is due at 1330 GMT with
economists in a Reuters survey forecasting a $40.4 billion
deficit versus a 38.31 billion deficit for November.
 ""Our economists expect that today's trade data will show
greater import strength (as indicated by strong domestic
spending in Q4 GDP) more than offsetting the expected gain in
exports and leading to a wider deficit,"" said RBC analysts in a
note.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2011 06:52AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Russian-British relations," Feb 11 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
will pay a rare visit to London next week for talks with British
Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William
Hague.
 Here are some details of diplomatic disputes and economic
ties between Britain and Russia.
 
 * LITVINENKO CASE
 -- The largest single source of strain in Russian-British
relations remains the November 2006 murder in London of emigre
Alexander Litvinenko, a Kremlin critic and former state security
officer, who was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210.
 -- Russia refuses to extradite suspect Andrei Lugovoy, an
ex-KGB bodyguard who is now a member of Russia's parliament, and
says Britain has not yet provided full information about the
case. Britain denies that.
 -- The row led to tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions from
London and Moscow in July 2007.
 
 * BORIS BEREZOVSKY:
 -- Moscow has resented London granting refugee status to
Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, a former Kremlin insider who
became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin.
 -- Britain has rejected Russian requests to extradite
Berezovsky, who has lived in London since 2000 and is wanted in
Moscow on several criminal charges he says are baseless.
 -- Berezovsky won a libel suit at London's High Court last
year over claims on a Russian TV channel that he was connected
with the poisoning of Litvinenko, his close associate.
 
 * SPYING:
 -- Last December Russia accused Britain of ""paranoid
spymania"" and hinted the brief arrest of Katia Zatuliveter, a
Russian aide to a member of Britain's parliament, could set back
efforts to improve relations.. 
 -- Also in December, Britain expelled a Russian diplomat,
citing evidence of Russian intelligence operations against
British interests. Russia called the move groundless and
expelled a British diplomat in return.
 -- Spy rows between London and Moscow go back to the Cold
War. In 2006, Russia's FSB security service said a fake rock
found in a Moscow park concealed a device used by British spies
to communicate with Moscow agents.
 
 * AKHMED ZAKAYEV:
 -- Zakayev, a senior commander in two separatist wars with
Moscow in the 1990s, represents the moderate wing of the Chechen
separatist movement. Accused by Russia of being a terrorist, he
has been subject to an international arrest warrant since 2001.
-- A British court turned down a Russian request to extradite
Zakayev in November 2003. The judge said Zakayev faced a
substantial risk of torture if he was sent back to Russia.
 
 * YEVGENY CHICHVARKIN:
 -- Chichvarkin, who helped found Russian mobile phone
retailer Euroset, fled to Britain in 2008, saying he could be
killed if jailed in Russia, where he faced charges of extortion
and kidnapping. He said the charges were politically motivated.
 -- In September, a British court delayed a hearing into
Russia's request to extradite Chichvarkin. Last month, he said
Russian authorities had dropped their criminal case but that he
would not return to Russia, fearing new charges.
 
 * GUARDIAN REPORTER:
 -- Luke Harding, a British reporter for the London-based
Guardian newspaper, was refused entry to Russia at a Moscow
airport last weekend and put on a plane back to Britain, his
visa annulled, the newspaper said.
 -- The Guardian said that Harding may have been expelled for
reporting on Wikileaks diplomatic cables that contained
unflattering descriptions of Russia's leadership. Russian
officials said he had violated rules for foreign journalists.
 
 * TRADE TIES
 -- British companies accounted for $18.9 billion of the $266
billion in foreign investment Russia has attracted since the
1991 Soviet collapse. Britain is the sixth most popular
destination for Russian investment, with nearly $3 billion as of
September 2010.
 -- British oil giant BP has been operating in Russia through
its TNK-BP joint venture since 2003.
 Last month, BP gained more direct access to Russian oil,
reaching a share swap deal with state-controlled Rosneft under
which they plan joint exploration of an Arctic area BP says may
contain billions of barrels of oil and gas.
 -- More than 1,000 British companies operate in Russia in
industries such as retail, food production and manufacturing.
 For Russian companies, London is the traditional venue for
selling billions of dollars worth of stocks and bonds.
 -- The volume of bilateral trade quadrupled over five years
and reached $22.5 billion in 2008, with Russian exports to
Britain accounting for $15 billion. It fell to $12.6 billion in
2009 but edged up to $15.9 billion in 2010, according to Russian
government statistics.

 * Spat over barred journalist the latest irritant
 
 By Lidia Kelly
 MOSCOW, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign minister heads
to Britain on Monday for a rare visit as the two countries
build up trade ties despite unresolved differences over the
murder of a Kremlin critic in London five years ago.
 Sergei Lavrov will meet Prime Minister David Cameron and
Foreign Secretary William Hague during the two-day trip, his
first visit to Britain for purely bilateral purposes since his
appointment as Russia's top diplomat in 2004.
 Within the past week, tensions bubbled up again after a
British reporter for the Guardian newspaper was barred from
Russia and put on a plane back to London. In December, the two
countries engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions
reminiscent of Cold War spy rows.
 Commercial links are in better shape: Britain's BP and
Russia's state-controlled Rosneft announced a share swap and
Arctic exploration deal last month that suggested the lure of
Russia's oil wealth outweighs diplomatic tensions.
 Moscow has played down the dispute over the expulsion of
Guardian journalist Luke Harding, who in a December report on
WikiLeaks cables had described Russia as ""a corrupt, autocratic
kleptocracy centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin"", the
prime minister. It says Harding could return to Russia if he
sorts out his accreditation status.
 ""Attempts to spoil the atmosphere before the visit are
artificial,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander
Lukashevich told a briefing on Wednesday. ""Both sides are united
in the understanding that remaining problems must not hinder the
progressive development of dialogue.""
 But for nearly half a decade, their remarks on the main
issue clouding relations have sounded more like mutually
exclusive monologues, and that will not change when Lavrov
visits London.
 Russia refuses to extradite Andrei Lugovoy, the suspect
Britain wants to prosecute for the murder of Alexander
Litvinenko, a former Russian state security officer who died in
London in 2006 from poisoning by radioactive polonium-210.
 Even before Litvinenko's killing, relations were strained by
espionage claims, Western concerns about human rights and
democracy and Russian anger at Britain for granting asylum to
prominent Kremlin foes.
 In an October visit to Moscow, Hague said Britain had not
changed its stance on Lugovoy.
 
 DISPUTES AND DEALS
 In a BBC interview before his trip, Lavrov made clear Moscow
has not budged either. Russian authorities are still waiting for
Britain to share information that would help them investigate
Litvinenko's death, he said.
 But Lavrov said he has the ""right chemistry"" with Hague and
that both countries ""want to go forward"" and cooperate ""in the
areas where we can do so -- and they are plenty.""
 Economic cooperation is ""the real foundation of our
relationship"", Lavrov said.
 In a statement this week, Hague said the countries would
concentrate on ""tackling the major global challenges and further
deepening our already strong trade relationship"".
Britain is one of the top foreign investors in Russia: its
companies accounted for $18.9 billion of the $266 billion in
outside investment that Russia has attracted since the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union.
 In the five years before the global financial crisis struck,
political tension failed to dent a fourfold increase in the
volume of bilateral trade, which reached $22.5 billion in 2008.
It fell to $12.6 billion in 2009 but edged up to $15.9 billion
in 2010, according to Russian government statistics.
 More than 1,000 British businesses have a base in Russia.
 While Russia's investment climate is marred by corruption,
Russian officials point to the BP-Rosneft deal as evidence the
pluses outweigh the minuses.
 ""Deals like this ... suggest that Russia appears to be a
very attractive country for English businesses and conditions
for investment are absolutely acceptable,"" Russia's ambassador
to Britain, Alexander Yakovenko, said on television on Thursday.

most hawkish or inflation-conscious policymakers. ""Do I look
like a hawk? Is it the shape of my nose?"" Mersch, a keen gymnast
in his younger years, once joked in response to journalists'
questions.
 -- Mersch has explained he is more sensitive to inflation
dangers than other policymakers because Luxembourg wages are
automatically linked to inflation, risking a vicious spiral of
prices and wages feeding on each other. ECB observers remember
his insistence that the central bank ""walk the talk"" by backing
up rhetoric with action.
 -- Mersch has stressed that price stability is the bank's
key objective, but after the credit crunch struck in August
2007, he adopted a less rigid stance, even more so after the
fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. 
 -- Since May 2009, when rates dropped to a record low of 1.0
percent, Mersch has talked about the negative side effects
associated with very low rates, such as in the money markets,
and their diminished marginal efficiency.
 -- He has also advocated an exit from the ECB's exceptional
measures saying repeatedly that there are signs of a broad-based
recovery, that low interest rates encourage risk-taking and that
such measures tend to distort banks' decisions.

(Adds German and French ministers on ECB and reforms)
 By Noah Barkin and Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Bundesbank chief Axel Weber and
Chancellor Angela Merkel were set to confirm on Friday his exit
from the race to be the next head of the European Central Bank,
as Berlin signalled it would not insist on a German getting the
job.
 ""Germany has never insisted that the next ECB president be a
German,"" Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after talks
with the French economy minister and French central bank chief.
 ""We now want to solve the question of institutional reform
in the Eurogroup. Once that is solved we will discuss the
question of who is the best candidate (for the ECB).""
 Weber, Merkel and Schaeuble were scheduled to meet at 1400
GMT, with the chancellor's spokesman Steffen Seibert saying that
a written statement would follow the meeting.
 ""This afternoon we will be able to put an end to the
speculation,"" Seibert told reporters.
 Weber has not yet commented on the news, first reported by
Reuters on Wednesday, that he was withdrawing from the contest
to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet at the helm of the ECB.
 The prospect of a hardline inflation fighter like Weber no
longer being top contender to replace Trichet when his term ends
in October has fed unease in financial markets about the ability
of divided European policymakers to solve the euro zone crisis.
 The ECB has played a crucial role in responding to the
crisis, buying the bonds of debt-stricken peripheral euro zone
countries as part of a concerted push to calm markets. Weber's
public criticism of that decision may have cost him the top job.
 The Frankfurt-based central bank stepped in again for the
first time in two weeks on Thursday to buy Portuguese bonds,
traders said, after yields hit euro-era highs on concerns about
perceived slow progress on solving the year-long debt crisis.
 
 FRANCO-GERMAN PUSH ON REFORMS
 Weber's withdrawal is a blow to Merkel's drive to secure the
ECB post for a German and could raise pressure on her to impose
tough German-style fiscal rules on euro zone partners to satisfy
voters in a year of seven state elections. [ID:nLDE71918F]
 The news comes ahead of two crucial summits -- on March 11
and March 24-25 -- at which European leaders want to agree a
comprehensive package to resolve the debt crisis.
 Germany and France want their ""competitiveness pact"" on
public spending in Europe to be part of the broader package, in
return for agreeing to strengthen a 440 billion euro bailout
fund.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said Paris would
try to incorporate one of the proposals -- to emulate Germany's
""debt brake"" imposing strict limits on issuing government debt.
 ""In the coming months, before the end of 2011, we will look
into incorporating in the constitution rules that permanently
secure a balanced budget,"" she said.
 Merkel's spokesman Seibert said there was no cause to fear
the Bundesbank would neglect its duties because of doubts over
the future of Weber, who could also give up the position as head
of the German central bank he is mandated to hold until next
year.
 ""The Bundesbank will continue to represent our convictions
about a stable currency policy. That does not depend on one
individual,"" said Seibert.
 Leaders from the 17-nation euro zone are expected to approve
a successor to Trichet by summer and will take their cues from
Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 A French source said Merkel and Sarkozy had not discussed
the ECB succession yet. [ID:nPISADE7XL]
 Italy is pushing the candidacy of Mario Draghi, governor of
the Bank of Italy and a member of the ECB's governing council.
Other contenders include Luxembourg's Yves Mersch and Finnish
central Bank chief Erkki Liikanen, a monetary policy moderate.

 (Adds details, comment, background)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Chinese bathroom, kitchen and
paving tiles face new import duties in EU Commission plans set
to be approved next week and designed to quell a price war
crimping profits in one of Europe's manufacturing strongholds.
 Duties of up to 73 percent will hit some 275 million euros
($373 million) in Chinese ceramic tiles the EU says are being
exported annually to Europe at illegally low prices and hurting
European producers, industry sources and diplomats told Reuters.
 ""Europe's ceramics industry has been looking for years for
ways to attack growing imports from China, so it's not
surprising the duties are quite high,"" an EU diplomat told
Reuters on Friday.
 Such imports have hurt European Union ceramics makers based
largely in Italy, Portugal and Spain.
 The duty plan by the EU executive is widely expected to be
approved during a meeting of EU government representatives next
Thursday. It affects all but one Chinese producer, which has
been granted a lower duty of 26 percent, sources said.
 Duties must be launched by March 18 and can stay in place
for up to six months while the Commission considers whether to
impose definitive duties, which would be valid for five years.
 
 CERAMICS STRONGHOLD
 The European Union is the world's biggest ceramic tiles
producer after China and exports 25 percent of its production,
with market share rising abroad, according to industry figures.
 The 27-state bloc uses about one billion square metres of
floor and wall tiles every year -- almost enough to cover
Greater London. About 7 percent of these are sourced from China.
 ""China is gaining market share in Europe. But much more
importantly, we have lost profitability and we argue that this
is because of pressure from China through market dumping,"" said
Renaud Batier, managing director of the European Ceramic Tile
Manufacturers' Federation, which asked the Commission to
investigate Chinese export practices last year.
 The federation says profit margins of its 500 member firms
shrank to 0.28 percent in 2009 from almost 7 percent in 2005.
 Yet it is uncertain duties will boost profits for European
producers, as importers may turn to Turkey or Indonesia for
cheap tiles, said the European DIY Retail Association, whose
members include British-based home improvements firm Kingfisher
and France's Leroy Merlin.
 ""There was some worry among importers when the investigation
started, but then they decided, let's just adapt our sourcing.
We can find ways of not having to rely on China,"" said the DIY
association's director Alisdair Gray.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2011 05:48AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Bumper year or bumpy ride for sprinting investors?," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Equity investors have been
behaving like sprinters rather than middle-distance runners when
it comes to developed markets this year, threatening in many
cases to reach year-end targets for gains months in advance.
 It suggests they are either in for a bumper year or heading
for a bumpy ride. It also makes markets particularly susceptible
to short sell-offs triggered by anything from food inflation
scares to Egypt unrest to suddenly disappointing earnings.
 At the end of last year, consensus predictions were for
equities to make steady gains but not to rack up the kinds of
massive rises seen in 2009. High single-digit to low
double-digit gains were expected for major developed markets.
 Roughly six weeks into 2011, some are already there even
after this week's wobbles.
 Consider, for example, the S&P 500. The Reuters poll in
December showed equity strategists expecting the broad index of
U.S. stocks to gain 5.36 percent.
 As of Thursday's close, it had already captured 95 percent
of that.
 Other developed indexes tell the same story. France's CAC
has 73 percent of its expected annual gain; Germany's DAX 60
percent and Britain's FTSE 30 percent.
 Even Japan's Nikkei, set with a poll target of 17.31
percent, is already 21 percent of the way to the goal.
 Italy's MIB, meanwhile, has managed the impressive
achievement of gaining more than 12 percent, 133 percent of what
strategists thought it could manage for the whole year.
 All this, remember, before the middle of February.
 Globally, MSCI's developed world stock index is up 4.3
percent for the year.
 If that kept up, it would be a compounded gain of around 45
percent for the year, easily the largest annual gain in the
index's 23 year history.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 TIME TO REASSESS
 This market behaviour means one of two things is likely to
to happen -- either the strategists' projections are
spectacularly wrong and a record-breaking year is in the making,
or some form of correction, at least in pace, is ahead.
 From the standpoint of investor positioning, there is scant
evidence to suggest investors are getting overly nervous.
 Reuters asset allocation polls at the end of January showed
solid overweights in equities and exposure growing. Fund tracker
EPFR Global's latest report, meanwhile, showed developed market
funds taking in money for the seventh week in the past eight.
 Some investors, indeed, are sounding increasingly bullish.
 Joachim Faber, chief executive officer of the giant Allianz
Global Investors, told Reuters this week that there were
""extraordinarily good conditions"" on European share markets.
 ""We have an interest rate that is clearly below what is
justified by the quality of developments at companies. Interest
rates can't be higher because of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and
so forth."" he said
 ""Secondly, the world economy is giving a lot of support to
exports, so we've got a tailwind. So, I think it will be a good
year.""
 MSCI's euro zone stock index is up nearly 7 percent for
2011, close to eclipsing some annual projections.
 It has all but met Generali Investments' in-house projection
for the year, for example. So what does an investors do?
 Klaus Wiener, Generali's head of research, said it
scrutinises what has happened, taking into account the gains to
set new targets.
 ""Given what we have seen over the past few months it needs
to be reassessed,"" Wiener said. ""Equities will probably (be)
better than forecast.""
 But he added that the pace of gains has been such that his
firm may take a bit of risk out of their portfolios this month.
 
 TROUBLE AHEAD?
 It is when that happens that markets start to wobble and the
recent three-day falls in global stocks may reflect investors
taking advantage of negative events to lock in some of the
year's gains.
 Egypt, for example, has had some impact, mainly by pushing
up the price of oil and feeding a growing unease about inflation
and possible future monetary tightening.
 More unnerving for some stock investors has been the sudden
appearance of disappointing corporate earnings reports, mainly
in Europe but also on Wall Street.
 That kind of thing undermines one of the biggest drivers
behind the developed market equity rally.
 The performance of emerging market stocks, in the meantime,
has been the flip side of developed, with barely any progress
towards analysts' targets and losses in some cases.
 Some firms, such as Goldman Sachs, expect fund flows to turn
back to emerging markets later in the year.
 In that sense, the developed market race could well turn
from sprint to hurdle.

 * China can defuse yuan tension with words -state advisers	
 * China says U.S. inciting emerging nations to attack yuan	
 * But independent analysts warn Beijing against complacency	
 
 By Zhou Xin and Koh Gui Qing	
 BEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The United States has incited
Brazil and India to criticise China's currency policy, but
Beijing need not worry too much because it can defuse the
tension through talks, a series of Chinese government advisers
told Reuters.	
 Independent analysts warned, however, that a belief that
Brazil and India are doing Washington's bidding and are not
truly aggrieved could make Beijing complacent and undermine
fledgling ties between the emerging powers.	
 Increasingly widespread calls for a stronger yuan are
awkward for China, which is accustomed to facing U.S. pressure
over its tightly controlled exchange rate but has long tried to
cast itself as the natural ally of other developing nations.	
 Brazil and India are unlikely to be any more successful than
the United States in persuading Beijing to permit faster
appreciation, researchers in Chinese government think tanks
said.	
 ""They must realise that the root of problem is not China but
the United States,"" said Chen Fengying, director of the World
Economy Institute at the Institute of Contemporary International
Relations in Beijing.	
 ""Yes, we know India's inflation is high and Brazil is
raising interest rates, but how can China's currency policy
solve your problems?""	
 Critics accuse Beijing of giving its exporters an unfair
advantage by keeping the yuan low, but the Chinese advisers said
that an ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy debasing the dollar was
to be blamed for rising currencies in developing nations.	
 
 
 CRUMBLING BRICS	
 The ""BRIC"" grouping of fast-growing emerging markets --
Brazil, Russia, India and China -- would provide Beijing with an
avenue for making its case, the advisers told Reuters.	
 ""Complaints from other BRIC countries add to the pressure
over the yuan as they are key trading partners and China has to
take them seriously,"" said Song Hong, a senior researcher in the
Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.	
 ""However, China is unlikely to change its ways because of
the additional pressure. When the United States pressed China,
China explained itself to Washington, and China can do the same
with the BRIC countries,"" he said.	
 The BRICs, a term coined by Goldman Sachs in 2001 to
describe the growing influence of large emerging economies, have
been at the forefront in pushing for more clout in international
forums for developing nations.	
 Despite a shared interest in increasing their stature, the
foursome have struggled with gaping differences over climate and
trade issues and have yet to come up with clear proposals to
advance a common agenda.	
 The divisions have sharpened recently.	
 Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao said this
week that an artificially low yuan hurt his country.	
 And Brazil's newly elected President Dilma Rousseff, in part
pressured by a relentless rise in the real currency, has pointed
to an undervalued yuan as a threat, flooding her country with
cheap Chinese imports and eroding Brazil's export
competitiveness.	
 ""No matter if the pressure is from developed countries or
emerging markets, the Chinese government is very unlikely to
yield too much over the exchange rate issue,"" said He Maochun,
an international studies professor at Tsinghua University.	
 
 BUMP ON THE ROAD	
 For China, the smoking gun was U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner's visit to Brazil this week, where he urged
Roussef to do more to lobby Beijing to let its currency rise.	
 ""The United States incites emerging countries to besiege the
yuan,"" read the top headline in the Chinese commerce ministry's
official newspaper on Friday.	
 ""Although the situation facing China's exchange rate is
becoming more difficult, it will still be controllable,"" it
said.	
 Zhou Zhiwei, a Latin American specialist in the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, described it as a bump in the road.	
 ""Ties between BRIC countries today are stronger than they
were 10 years ago, so it is normal to have friction and
conflicts. That won't affect cooperation,"" he said.	
 The BRICs have held annual summits since 2009. With China
scheduled to play host this year, the government advisers said
Beijing must remind the others of how its appetite for raw
materials and investment flows had propped up their growth.	
 But Gregory Chin, director of global development research at
CIGI, a think tank in Canada, said Beijing would need to offer
something more concrete to mend fences, particularly with
Brazil, which it had been trying to cultivate as a closer
partner.	
 Short of speeding up yuan appreciation, China could try to
make peace by offering Brazil more trade financing and
preferential access to the Chinese market, he said.	
 ""China is going to have look more seriously at Brazilian
interests. It is not something that can be papered over so
easily,"" Chin said.	
 The yuan weakened against the dollar on Friday in an
apparent expression of Beijing's displeasure over renewed U.S.
pressure for faster appreciation.	
 It has risen about 3.5 percent since China unshackled it
from its peg to the dollar last June, but it has been kept
little changed so far this year.

 * World stocks fall for third straight day
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for the third
straight day on Friday partly on growing tensions in Egypt after
President Hosni Mubarak disappointed protesters hoping he would
resign, though oil and the dollar advanced.
Partly because of the Egypt crisis, Asian stocks were on the
course for their biggest weekly loss in nine months and European
shares were down. U.S. stock index futures also fell, indicating
a weak open on Wall Street.
 However, the safe-haven Swiss franc fell against the dollar
after Swiss consumer price inflation eased slightly and gold
eased.
 Egypt's people-power protesters, reeling with disillusion
and anger, planned massive new demonstrations on Friday but the
powerful army guaranteed the lifting of 30-year-old emerging
laws and free and fair elections in a bid to end the popular
uprising.
 Egypt five-year credit default swaps, insurance-like
contracts against debt default, rose 39 basis points to 380 bps.
 ""Everyone had hoped the situation in Egypt was going to go
smoothly, but the chances of this are small,"" Koen De Leus,
strategist at KBC Securities Bolero in Brussels, said.
 ""There is going to be nervousness in the market and there
are worries of possible contagion in other Middle Eastern
countries.""
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index fell
0.5 percent, down for the third day in a row partly hit by
disappointment with corporate earnings. The index, however, is
still up 2.6 percent so far this year.
 The MSCI emerging market index dropped 0.6 percent, and is
down 6 percent since the beginning of the year as some investors
shift out of the booming emerging markets on concerns over
inflation and bet on improving growth in the United States.
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares-ex-Japan fell more than
4 percent this week, set for its worst performance since May
2010.

 
 OIL HIGHER
 Worries that rising tensions in Egypt could spread disorder
to other countries in the oil-rich region sent U.S. crude

 ""Yesterday, there were the ups and downs of hopes that the
situation in Egypt was going to be resolved, but that did not
happen,"" said David Cohen, economist at Action Economics in
Singapore.
 ""So, there's still a degree of uncertainty hanging. The
politics in Cairo remains a source of pressure on oil prices.""
 Higher oil prices would put further pressure on the
inflationary situation in emerging economies, threatening to
hamper global growth and exaggerate the shift of funds out of
emerging markets to developed countries.
 The 18th day of unrest in Egypt also helped the dollar,
which was up 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies. The
U.S. currency was up 0.4 percent at 0.9731 francs.
 Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 4 basis points to
3.6588 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.7 percent,
though it is still up 3.5 percent this year, and the euro fell
0.5 percent to $1.3522.
 Portugal's stocks dropped 0.9 percent, though the country's
10-year Portuguese debt yield was little changed on the day at
7.326 percent, steady relative to euro zone benchmark German
Bunds, after rising to 7.656 percent on Thursday to top the
previous record set in November.
 ""Portugal faces a huge round of debt redemptions in April
and with current yields on Portuguese debt holding just below
post-euro creation highs it is not unreasonable to fear that
Portugal may need some sort of financial support this spring,""
said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.

 By Masayuki Kitano	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The dollar touched a one-month
high against the yen on Friday after data underscored that the
U.S. labour market was on the mend, while the Australian dollar
fell after its central bank said interest rates were likely to
stay on hold for some time.	
 U.S. report showing new applications for unemployment
benefits dropped to a 2-1/2 year low last week helped shore up
the dollar, which edged higher against a basket of currencies.	
 The euro remained under pressure after falling the previous
day, weighed down by renewed jitters about the euro zone debt
crisis.	
 ""Any easy gains in the euro are susceptible to rapid
reversal,"" said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC
Dominion Securities.	
 ""Overnight EU peripheral jitters reemerged ... the euro
reacted as one might expect, it sold off from just over $1.37 to
a low of $1.3577."" 
 The euro last traded at $1.3582 , down 0.2 percent
from late U.S. trading on Thursday. Support is seen at around
$1.3483, a level representing the 38.2 percent retracement of
the January to February rally.	
 Traders said the European Central Bank stepped in to buy
Portuguese bonds after yields on the country's debt hit euro-era
highs on a perceived lack of progress towards resolving the
block's year-long debt crisis. 
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 83.44 yen
on trading platform EBS, touching its highest level in
about a month.	
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was last at 78.316, up 0.1
percent on the day.	
 A trader for a major Japanese bank in Singapore said gains
in the dollar against some Asian currencies such as the South
Korean won helped support the U.S. currency against other
major currencies.	
 The dollar rose against the South Korean won after South
Korea's central bank surprised market players by holding
interest rates unchanged. A majority of analysts polled by
Reuters had been expecting a 25-basis-point rate rise on Friday.	
 The Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to $0.9997
, having come under pressure after Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) Governor Glenn Stevens said it was reasonable to
expect rates to be on hold for some time. 
 Some traders have said that the part of the reason behind
the Australian dollar's retreat in recent sessions is an
accumulation of long positions in the currency.	
 Latest U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows
that currency speculators increased their net long positions in
the Australian dollar to 60,077 contracts in the week ended Feb.
1, up from 45,458 lots the previous week.

 By John Ruwitch and Ngo Thi Ngoc Chau	
 HANOI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Vietnam devalued its beleaguered
currency on Friday for the third time in a year, as authorities
start to try to address festering economic problems that critics
say have been brushed aside in the pursuit of growth. 
 The State Bank of Vietnam dropped the dong's reference rate
by 8.5 percent against the dollar and narrowed the
currency's trading band to 1 percent from 3 percent on either
side of that midpoint rate.	
 The combined effect pulled the weak limit of the band down
about 7 percent to 20,900 from 19,500, and brought official and
black market exchange rates closer to alignment.	
 The International Monetary Fund welcomed the changes, but
said authorities needed a ""broader set of policies"" to restore
macroeconomic stability.	
 The dong, unlike nearly all other Asian currencies, has
been weakening against the U.S. dollar. Confidence in the local
currency is low in Vietnam, where dollars and gold are widely
used as currencies for major purchases and as a hedge against
inflation.	
 Friday's devaluation was the sixth -- and by far the biggest
-- in nearly three years. Exactly one year earlier, the dong was
devalued by 3.2 percent, and in August there was a 2.0 percent
devaluation. The currency's slide has come during a turbulent
period in which authorities have grappled with volatile
inflation, wide trade and fiscal deficits, rising global gold
prices along with sinking confidence in the dong. For a timeline
click .	
 Economists applauded the move but said it would not be a
panacea and the central bank now needed to target double-digit
inflation, which the devaluation could exacerbate.	
 ""This is a bold and decisive step by the central bank,"" said
economist and former government advisor Le Dang Doanh. ""But the
devaluation should be just part of a package of measures that
the government should take.""	
 Many economists and international organisations, including
the IMF, had said authorities were overly focused last year on
attaining high gross domestic product growth before a January
meeting, held once every five oyears, of the Communist
leadership. Inflation soared to near two-year highs.	
 Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's and all downgraded
Vietnam's sovereign credit rating last year, citing
macroeconomic imbalances.	
 The new reference rate was 20,693 dong per dollar, down from
18,932 in place since mid-August 2010. After the move, currency
traders said the dong was being quoted about 40-60 dong beyond
the band on the interbank market.	
 
 LOW RESERVES, HIGH INFLATION	
 The central bank said in a statement it would monitor the
reference rate, which it sets each day, ""relatively flexibly"" in
the coming time. Some traders said that comment and the narrower
trading band implied that the central bank may move the
reference rate more regularly.	
 Since June 2008 the dong reference rate has been devalued by
more than 20 percent and foreign exchange reserves have fallen
sharply, making it increasingly difficult for the government to
break a cycle of devaluation expectations. Most other currencies
in the region gained ground against the weak dollar.	
 Minister of Planning and Investment Vo Hong Phuc was quoted
in state media earlier this week as saying foreign exchange
reserves were ""more than $10 billion"" at the end of 2010.
Reserves were nearly $24 billion at the end of 2008. In December
2009, the central bank estimated reserves at $16 billion.	
 Doanh said the low reserves had left the central bank little
choice but take a big enough step to realign exchange rates.	
 Economists at Standard Chartered said the devaluation should
ease downward pressure on reserves and help exports, but
inflation would remain a problem.	
 ""The latest devaluation could also lead to higher imported
inflation in the months ahead, especially when combined with
rising global commodity prices. While the central bank remains
comfortable with the current level of interest rates, we see a
need for higher rates in order to pre-empt economic overheating
risks,"" the bank wrote on Friday.	
 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) also said the
devaluation underscored the need for rate hikes.	
 The consumer price index rose to a near two-year high of
more than 12 percent in January.	
 The central bank raised the base rate in early November by
100 basis points to 9 percent. Between then and January, while
the base rate has stayed flat, it hiked the reverse repo rate on
7-day open market operations by 400 basis points to 11 percent
in a tightening move.	
 Still, businesses in Vietnam have been complaining that
lending rates are too high at up to 20 percent, and officials
say they hope to eventually bring rates down.	
 
 EXPECTED MOVE	
 The dong has languished outside its band for more than four
months on unofficial markets , hovering in recent
weeks about 6-7 percent beyond the weak limit.	
 On Friday morning the dong was quoted at 21,300/21,400 per
dollar on the unofficial market in Hanoi, according to two major
gold shops that double as a foreign exchange dealers.	
 Stocks dipped slightly after the news, but recovered with
the benchmark Vietnam Index closing down just 0.05
percent and the Hanoi Index gaining 0.13 percent.	
 ""For the short term (the devaluation) is bad, but after a
week I expect more foreigners will come into the stock market to
trade, so it'll be good for the market,"" said Quach Manh Hao,
Deputy Director of Thang Long Securities.	
 ""This is a message to the market that the government will
focus on stabilising foreign exchange for the whole year.""	
 Currency traders and economists had widely expected the
State Bank of Vietnam to make a move around this time after a
senior official in early November ruled out a devaluation before
Tet, the lunar new year festival, saying that authorities would
instead tap foreign exchange reserves to try to meet dollar
demand.	
 The Tet holiday ended on Monday and market activity resumed
on Tuesday.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell more than a
percent and were on course for their biggest weekly loss in nine
months as investors shunned risk on concerns about the pace of
policy tightening in the region and growing tensions in Egypt.	
 A broad sell-off in Asia since the start of 2011 on
inflationary worries has shown no signs of abating, as
expectations of more monetary tightening have encouraged
investors to shift funds from emerging to developed markets.	
 Analysts said the selling in emerging markets could have
some more room to run, especially in countries where stocks are
ripe for a pullback after last year's stellar gains and the near
term interest rate outlook is unclear.	
 On Friday, Taiwan shares ended down more than two
percent, stock markets in Thailand and Korea were
down one percent, while Australia's benchmark index
snapped a seven-day winning streak a investors took profits from
banking and resource shares.	
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares-ex-Japan
is set to fall by more than 4 percent this week, its worst
performance since May 2010.	
 So far this year, Asian shares have underperformed the MSCI
world index by five points as traders cut
positions due to a steady drip of strong data out of the U.S.	


 ""Pressure on emerging market equities may well, therefore,
continue while uncertainties about the intensity, duration and
effect of the ongoing tightening cycle remain alive,"" Barclays
strategists said in a weekly note.	
 This week alone, China raised interest rates, Philippines
held rates but raised its inflation forecast and Bank of Korea
surprised markets by holding rates steady, although it is widely
expected to tighten again in March.	
 Foreign selling has picked up in Asian shares, especially in
South Korea this week while offshore selling in Taiwan on
Thursday was the biggest in six months.	
 Indonesian shares fell 0.6 percent with shares in PT
Garuda Indonesia , the nation's state-owned carrier,
tanking by more than 20 percent on debut. 
 Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday.	
 
 METALS GAIN	
 Copper rose back above $10,000 per tonne, while tin
prices hit a record high as strong U.S. jobless data reassured
investors about the pace of the recovery in the world's biggest
economy. .	
 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's plans to relinquish
powers but not step down did little to boost investor hopes of a
quick solution to the Egyptian crisis and lifted oil prices
. 
 Gold , was steady at around $1,364 an ounce and U.S.
crude oil futures rose 88 cents to $87.61 a barrel. . 
 In the currency markets, the dollar edged higher after
notching up solid gains against the euro overnight and after
traders said the European Central Bank stepped in to rescue a
failing Portuguese bond auction. .	
 Broad trading patterns in the euro are in line with
wave formations and the single currency may be in the initial
stages of what may be a decline towards the lower end of a broad
1.3250-1.3850 range.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank chief
said on Friday that interest rates will probably stay on hold
until late in the year, knocking more than half a cent off the
Australian dollar and sparking a rally in interbank bill
futures.	
 Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens sounded
upbeat about the longer-term prospects for the economy,
highlighting the mining investment boom and strong terms of
trade, keeping intact the central bank's tightening bias.	
 But with recent data showing benign price pressure, Stevens
conceded that the central bank may be ahead of the policy game.	
 Stevens told a parliamentary committee that market pricing
for no rate hike until late in the year was reasonable. 
 ""I feel that the current level is about right for the
medium-term outlook we have,"" he said.	
 The Australian dollar fell below parity with the
U.S. dollar for the first time since Feb 1 in the wake of his
comments, while interbank bill futures <0#YIB:> climbed, with
markets now eyeing a November rate hike.	
 Over the next 12 months, markets have discounted just 34
basis points worth of tightening .	
 ""Clearly they're very comfortable with the current policy
setting and cash rate level, but the tightening bias is there,""
said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australia strategy at RBC Capital
Markets.	


 The RBA kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent this
month, having previously hiked by 175 basis points since October
2009. It has said the last rate rise in November was a
pre-emptive strike against inflation.	
 
 The RBA aims to keep the consumer price index (CPI) in a 2-3
percent band over the long run. Fourth-quarter inflation was 2.7
percent.	
 
 UPBEAT OUTLOOK	
 Stevens also said while the effects of serious floods and
Cyclone Yasi could see real gross domestic product (GDP) one
percentage point lower than the pre-flood forecast, he believed
they will not derail the expansion.	
 He said the events should also not pose a serious threat to
the achievement of the medium-term goal for inflation, ""provided
the community can understand their temporary nature and
expectations of ongoing inflation remain well-anchored.""	
 The central bank has forecast GDP growth of 4 percent for
both 2012 and 2013, levels well above the historic trend of
around 3.25-3.5 percent.	
 Stevens said global growth, if anything, looked a little
stronger than before with China and India sustaining a strong
pace of expansion and global commodity prices rising further in
recent months.	
 Those most important to Australia, such as iron ore and
coal, were at very high levels, and as a result, the nation's
terms of trade, or ratio of export to import prices, were now
higher than assumed three months ago and will probably peak
higher and later than previous assumed, he said.	
 This has created a mining investment boom which the RBA is
trying to offset with slower domestic consumption. To that end,
the RBA acknowledged that household credit growth was quite
modest.	
 ""The average since the early 1960s is mining investment
maybe running at a bit under 2 percent, or around 2, and it's
going to be on its way to 5-1/2. So that's a big change. It's a
big story, no question about that,"" Stevens said.

after his comments, while interbank bill futures <0#YIB:> showed

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks ended flat
after a late buying surge as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said he would relinquish powers but not step down, while upbeat
weekly U.S. jobless claims data boosted the U.S. dollar.
 The greenback gained after the U.S. Labor Department
reported an unexpected drop in initial claims for unemployment
benefits to the lowest level in 2-1/2 years.
 Weak results from computer networking giant Cisco Systems
Inc  helped end an eight-day win streak for the Dow
industrials. Disappointing results for Swiss bank Credit Suisse
 and Diageo , the world's largest spirits
maker, weighed on European shares.
 Oil prices rose in anticipation of Mubarak stepping aside
and extended those gains in post-settlement trade.
 Gold recovered lost ground as the immediate reaction to
Mubarak's announcement alleviated some investor anxiety,
although the political upheaval appears far from over as
Egypt's streets erupted in rage when he did not resign after
two weeks of deadly protests.
 The Van Eck Market Vectors exchange-traded fund 
ended up 0.45 percent, cutting gains late when it appeared that
Mubarak was not stepping down. Previously, the fund had risen
as much as 5.8 percent.
 Mubarak said he is delegating powers to newly appointed
Vice President and trusted former intelligence chief, Omar
Suleiman.
 ""Egypt stopped us from dropping lower, but the low volume
means that people are skeptical of the climb we've had,""
Michael Nasto, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in
San Antonio, Texas, said of the stock markets' movement.

 DOLLAR SURGE
 The dollar's rise accelerated after the U.S. weekly jobless
claims report showed a drop in the latest week to a seasonally
adjusted 383,000, the lowest since July 2008.
 While the data underpinned the greenback's gains, investors
remain worried about Europe's lack of progress in tackling a
sovereign debt crisis which undermined the euro.
 ""Higher yields have benefited the dollar, while Portuguese
10-year bond yields are uncomfortably above 7 percent, which is
reminding investors that the stress in the euro zone periphery
has not disappeared,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging
markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 The euro, which hit a 12-week high above $1.38 this month,
struggled as investors drove Portuguese bond yields to their
highest since the currency was introduced in 1999.
 Portugal is considered at risk of becoming the next euro
zone country to need a bailout. The European Central Bank
stepped in to buy Portuguese bonds to help stabilize the
fragile market.
 The euro fell 0.93 percent to $1.3602 . The dollar
rose 1.17 percent against the Swiss franc to 0.9686 francs
 and rose 0.93 percent against the yen to 83.15 .
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, renewing their recent
sell-off, as traders sold older issues to make room for $16
billion in 30-year bonds  in this week's quarterly
refunding.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, March crude  was
up 85 cents to $87.56 a barrel, after settling up only 2 cents,
or 0.02 percent, at $86.73 a barrel.
 Spot gold  dropped 0.2 percent to $1,360.05 an
ounce.

 NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The dollar solidly
outperformed rival currencies on Thursday after a fall in U.S.
jobless claims, with more gains foreseen against the euro on
concerns that Europe is not adequately tackling its debt
crisis.
 The dollar rose for a seventh straight day against the yen.
The Swiss franc , meanwhile, fell as safe-haven demand
faded as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he would
transfer powers to his vice president. For details, see
[ID:nLDE7182MG]
 Traders said a recent spike in U.S. yields may prompt
further dollar gains in the days ahead.
 ""Higher yields have benefited the dollar, while Portuguese
10-year bond yields are uncomfortably above 7 percent, which is
reminding investors that the stress in the euro zone periphery
has not disappeared,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging

 U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds briefly traded more than a
point lower in price, extending losses following an auction of
$16 billion of the bonds. [nNYD003761]
 The euro hit a $1.3578 session low, with support seen at
$1.3541, the 100-day moving average. It pared losses by late
afternoon in New York and was last down 1.0 percent at $1.3591
. It remained above the widely perceived pivotal level of
$1.35.
 Thin said recent stronger U.S. data is likely to underpin a
dollar rally, with higher U.S. yields and a potential pivot
point in risk reversals also a signal of strength.
 ""The peripheral debt issues have not gone away and with
European leaders' next meeting about a month away, investors
are losing their patience,"" he said.
 The dollar neared a one-month high at 83.29 yen 
before easing to 83.23 yen, up 1.0 percent.
 The currency pair had breached 82.93, its Jan. 28 high, and
there were large stops at above 82.90 and 83.00. The break
above the Ichimoku ""Cloud"" put the technical bias to the
upside, a trader said.
 ""There are indications that the Japanese capital flow
picture is changing in a direction consistent with yen
weakening,"" said Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy
at Nomura Securities International. ""We are looking for
opportunities to go long dollar-yen.""
 A BofA Merrill Lynch research report suggested a short yen
position versus a long 2-year USD rate on a beta-weighted
basis. ""This trade is consistent with our core calls for
gradual weakening of the JPY and lower front-end US rates in
the medium term,"" the bank said.
 Sterling fell as low as $1.6011  overnight after
the Bank of England left interest rates at record lows despite

 U.S. JOBLESS CLAIMS FALL
 U.S. growth picked up in late 2010 and expectations of even
brisker expansion this year have driven up bond yields to
nine-month highs, though the Federal Reserve has failed to
signal plans to cut short a $600 billion bond-buying program.
 Adding to the optimism, U.S. claims for first-time jobless
benefits fell more than expected in the latest week to a

$1.3498, according to RBC Capital Markets. The $1.3498 level
will have to be taken out in order to sustain a deeper pullback
that would expose secondary supports at $1.3246 and $1.3015,
the bank said.

 By Michael O'Boyle and Ana Nicolaci da Costa
 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Chile's peso hit
its strongest level in more than a month on Thursday after a
poll backed bets of higher interest rates and intervention
risks were seen receding, while Brazil's currency slumped.
 Chile's central bank is seen raising its benchmark interest
rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 percent next week, according to
a poll. [ID:nSAG002722]
 Chilean policymakers held borrowing costs steady last month
to try to discourage yield-hungry investors from pouring into
its assets. The pause complemented a currency intervention
program introduced at the beginning of the year.
 But the move spooked bond investors, who fear the central
bank is not doing enough to tame rising inflation. Now
policymakers appear to be changing course.
 The central bank held back from expanding the intervention
program this week despite solid gains in the peso.
 ""People feel more comfortable that they will tolerate a
stronger peso, because they need to worry about inflation,""
said Igor Arsenin, head of Latin American debt strategy at
Credit Suisse in New York.
 Seven straight rate hikes last year drove the Chilean peso
to a nearly three-year high, pushing the central bank to buy
$50 million a day to help protect local exporters.
 Chile's peso  bid 0.57 percent stronger to 473.50
per dollar, its strongest since early January. The peso has
clawed back more than 5 percent from a 7 percent loss spurred
by news of the intervention in early January.
 Brazil's real  shed 0.6 percent to 1.669 per dollar,
pulling back sharply after the currency hit a more than
one-month high in the previous session.
 A broadly stronger dollar and a slump in the euro, a key
proxy for gauging demand for riskier assets like emerging
market currencies, weighed on the real and Mexico's peso.
[ID:nN10219781]
 NO MEXICAN MEDDLING
 Brazil's government unveiled budget cuts of about $30
billion on Wednesday in a bid to regain credibility among
investors worried that overspending is driving inflation higher
and beyond the control of the central bank. [ID:nN09134882]
 ""Yesterday we had a positive economic context here,
especially with the announcement of the budget cuts, it makes
Brazil seem more trustworthy ... so the day after it is normal
that you have an adjustment,"" said Andre Sacconato, economist
at Tendencias consultancy in Sao Paulo.
 Brazil has been waging an even more intense battle than
Chile to contain the strength of the real, which is considered
one of the most overvalued currencies in the world.
 Brazil offers among the highest interest rates available,
and a relentless flow of funds from global investors continues
to bode further strength despite heavy intervention.
 The central bank held a reserve currency swap auction on
Thursday, though the real did not react noticeably to the
news.[ID:nSPG003233]
 The Mexican peso  reversed steep early losses to
trade flat at 12.0765 per dollar after Mexico's finance
minister said the country will not intervene in foreign
exchange markets, brushing off complaints from exporters who
want a weaker peso. [ID:nN10293385]
 Mexico's peso has lagged the gains in other emerging
markets currencies, giving policymakers more room to stay on
the sidelines.
 But some had begun to bet Mexico could follow suit with
greater intervention after the peso gained around 4 percent
since November to hit a nearly 2-1/2 year high last month.

U.S. lawmakers launched a new attempt on Thursday to pass

 The bill would clear the way for the Commerce Department to
treat undervalued currency as a subsidy under U.S. trade law.

 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The European Union is drafting
proposals to temporarily suspend import duties on feed wheat and
barley to secure sufficient animal feed amid tight supplies and
high global prices, the bloc's executive said on Thursday.
 The European Commission said it had raised the idea, at a
meeting of the EU's cereals management committee, of suspending
duties of 12 euros per tonne on feed wheat and 16 euros per
tonne on feed barley until June 30, 2011.
 ""This is a reaction on the tight supplies on world cereals
markets, and the idea of the proposal is to help facilitate feed
cereals imports from outside the EU and so to reduce tensions on
the European markets,"" the Commission said in a statement.
 The proposal is likely to be put to a vote by EU government
experts at the management committee's next meeting on Feb. 24,
the Commission said.
 Strong exports from major EU producers France and Britain in
the early part of the 2010/11 campaign have led to tight
supplies within Europe, raising the prospect of imports from
countries such as Canada and Australia.
 EU feed makers have lobbied the Commission to suspend the
duties In recent months as surging feed prices stoked fears of a
sharp fall in the bloc's livestock herd.
 Until now, the EU executive has rejected the move, saying it
would have little effect on prices in the 27-nation bloc.
 The Commission said it would propose suspending the bloc's
12 euro per tonne tariff for low- and medium-quality wheat,
which is applied to the EU's annual tariff-rate quota (TRQ) of
2,989,240 tonnes.
 Of the total quota, 572,000 tonnes are earmarked for imports
from the United States, 38,853 for imports from Canada and the
remaining 2,378,387 for imports from other countries.
 Less than 2 percent of the 2011 import quota for feed wheat
had been taken up by Feb. 7, a Commission official said.

 The EU's annual import quota for feed barley is 306,214
tonnes, said the official.
 The last time the EU suspended most of its grain import
tariffs was in 2008 in response to tight supplies and soaring
world prices.

 By Danilo Masoni
 MILAN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - A conservative outlook from
Italian oil services firm Saipem sparked profit-taking on
Thursday following higher than expected fourth-quarter profits
as the industry benefits from a stronger oil price.
 Shares in Europe's biggest oil services group were down 3.3
percent by 1601 GMT as the STOXX Europe was up 0.5 percent.
 ""The share has had a very strong performance and today the
guidance for 2011 has not beaten what the market expected,"" a
Milan-based analyst said.
 Saipem shares reached an all-time high of 38.2 euros on Jan
17, their highest since listing in 1984.
 The company, controlled by Italian major Eni, said oil
industry spending was expected to rise in 2011, underpinning
expectations of improved market prospects for its sector.
 ""Onshore is expected to experience similar high levels of
investment as in 2010, whilst the offshore sector spending is
expected to increase,"" it said in a statement.
 Saipem, traditionally conservative in forecasts, predicted
adjusted net profit to grow around 5 percent this year and core
profits around 10 percent. A Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus
points to a 11.2 percent rise in 2011 core profits.
 The price of U.S. crude futures started the year above $90,
boosting prospects for new industry investment, overshadowing a
decline in gas projects as demand remained weak.
 The world's largest oil services firms, Schlumberger and
Halliburton of the United States, topped Wall Street forecasts
in their quarterly profits and pointed to steady growth.
 Saipem posted fourth-quarter adjusted net profit of 237
million euros, up 26 percent from a year earlier. Analysts
polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for 198 million
euros on average.
 It proposed a dividend of 0.63 euro per ordinary share,
against expectations for 0.59 euro.

 By Stephen Brown and Noah Barkin
 BERLIN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Axel Weber's shock withdrawal
from the ECB leadership contest has increased pressure on
Chancellor Angela Merkel to impose tough German fiscal rules on
euro zone partners to satisfy her coalition and voters at home.
 Weber's decision to step down, reported by Reuters on
Wednesday, was widely seen in Berlin as a blow to Merkel and her
drive to see a German replace Jean-Claude Trichet when his term
as president of the European Central Bank ends in October.
 German media said she had lost a vital ally in what some
depict as the battle to save the euro. Opposition politicians
accused her of throwing away a chance to put a home-grown
candidate at the helm of the central bank which sets monetary
policy for the 17-nation euro zone.
 People close to Merkel have said for weeks that her main
priority has been to ensure the new ""comprehensive package"" euro
leaders have promised to unveil next month has Berlin's policy
fingerprints all over it.
 Having lost a major bargaining chip in Weber, she has even
less wiggle room to compromise with EU partners at two crucial
summits -- on March 11 and March 24-25 -- which will shape the
future of Europe's 12-year old single currency zone.
 ""I think that Germany will now try much harder to push
through its points,"" said Daniela Schwarzer, an analyst at the
German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
 As she has been forced to do for months, Merkel must balance
the demands of domestic constituents, who expect her to drive a
hard bargain in Brussels, and the needs of European partners,
who are willing to accept some but not all of Berlin's demands.
 Lurking in the background are increasingly nervous financial
markets, whose confidence that EU leaders will forge a strong
agreement to stem contagion to countries like Portugal and Spain
seems to be fading.
 Portuguese bond yields shot up to their highest level since
the creation of the euro on Thursday and the single currency
fell back against the dollar as renewed doubts about the
promised package emerged.
 
 RED LINES
 Officials close to Merkel have indicated she is not wedded
to putting a German atop the ECB, but a failure to do so would
still be seen by many at home as a defeat.
 She now needs some other European success to impress voters
in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where a crucial state election will be
held on March 27, and Germany's top court in Karlsruhe, which
will rule on the legality of the euro zone's rescue mechanism in
the coming months.
 ""Merkel's room for maneouvre has become very limited,"" said
Wolfgang Nowak, head of the Alfred Herrhausen Society, a
Deutsche Bank think-tank.
 Her first priority will be ensuring key elements of the
controversial ""competitiveness pact"" she unveiled to EU partners
last week are adopted, despite widespread resistance.
 Chief among these is the demand that other euro zone members
enshrine German-style debt-brake rules in their constitutions or
national law. Others include raising national retirement ages in
line with demographic trends and ending inflation-indexing of
wages in several countries.
 Equally importantly, Merkel may be under added pressure
after Weber's withdrawal to resist demands from EU partners for
a bigger and more flexible euro zone rescue fund.
 Among ""red lines"" for some members of her coalition are
allowing the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) to buy the
bonds of struggling euro members or providing flexible credit
lines to countries before they are shut out of bond markts.
 There is also resistance to cutting the interest rates on
rescue loans to Greece and Ireland or extending their loan
repayment deadlines.
 Some allies want Merkel to resist any increase in the
effective lending capacity of the EFSF -- a key demand of her
euro zone partners and a step markets are now counting on --
unless she secures big concessions elsewhere.
 
 BUNDESTAG THREAT
 A senior member of her Free Democratic coalition partners
told Reuters on Thursday that without Weber, Merkel would face a
much tougher time winning approval in the lower house of
parliament if a weak compromise were sealed in Brussels.
 Any decision that would increase the financial burden on
Germany, including a boost in the EFSF's lending powers, has to
be approved by the Bundestag.
 ""Until now she could always reassure critics in the
Bundestag with promises that Weber would ensure stability as ECB
president,"" the FDP politician said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ""Now she stands alone in the face of these critics.""

 * Purchases stopped, farmers fear beans to start rotting
 * Local exporters still said to be buying cocoa
 
 By Loucoumane Coulibaly
 ABIDJAN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - A halt to cocoa-buying in Ivory
Coast is leaving beans to rot in farm warehouses, while
smuggling through Ghana intensifies and some growers switch to
other crops, farmers said on Thursday.
 Economic sanctions, a cocoa export ban and a liquidity
shortage since incumbent Laurent Gbagbo seized the central
bank's local branch has left the cocoa industry in chaos in the
world's largest grower as beans pile up in farms or are smuggled
out.
 Alassane Ouattara, who beat Gbagbo in a Nov. 28 presidential
poll, according to U.N.-certified electoral commission results
that Gbagbo refused to concede, last week called for a one-month
cocoa registration ban to starve his rival of tax revenues.
 Cocoa exporters, fearing sanctions by Western powers that
recognise Ouattara's win, have played ball. 
 In the western region of Soubre, at the heart of the cocoa
belt, farmers and one cooperative manager said in interviews
they no buyers were taking their beans last week and they feared
the poorly dried beans stashed in their warehouses would rot.
""Nothing's moving, everything's stopped,"" said farmer
Innocent Zamble, who runs a farm in the Soubre town of Meagui.
 ""Our stores are stuffed with beans and there's no more space
to stock them. We fear the quality is going to perish because we
don't have the capacity to stock big quantities long term.""
 
 ""FIRST TIME THEY'VE SEEN THIS""
 Ouattara has not said whether the ban will be extended when
it expires on Feb. 23. Exporters estimate that around 65,000
tonnes arrived at Abidjan and San Pedro ports in the two weeks
to Feb. 6, none of which has been exported.
 But even if it is lifted, EU restrictions on ships
registered there doing business with the port, which the
European Union says is supporting ""Gbagbo's illegal regime"",
will continue to interrupt export activities.
 And a shortage of liquidity means there is not enough cash
to pay suppliers on a day-to-day basis, exporters say.
 In the western region of Gagnoa, farmers and cooperative
managers said several growers were switching to growing
vegetables, tomatoes or maize, which can be harvested faster
for export or local trade.
 ""They're not paying for the cocoa and farmers have to
survive,"" said cooperative manager Francois Badiel. ""Lots of
them are now doing trunk farming (growing vegetables) instead.
This is the first time they've seen a situation like this.""
 In the eastern region of Abengourou, on the Ghana border,
farmers said huge numbers of cocoa trucks were crossing the
border in smuggling operations.
 ""When we saw how many trucks full of cocoa were heading over
the border every day, we said: 'There's not even that much cocoa
in our region',"" said Abengourou farmer Joseph Amani.
 ""It must be coming in from other regions as well. It's easy
to get it here from Daloa or Soubre by road.""
 A purchasing manager of an international cocoa exporter said
that while major international exporters have stopped purchases,
some local exporters were very active at the port, buying at
about 900 CFA francs ($1.86) per kg.
Local exporters have tended to support Gbagbo, while the big
multinationals are bound by their base countries in Europe or
the United States to recognise Ouattara's authority.
 ""The small local exporters are still very active in the past
week. They are buying a lot of cocoa, but I'm wondering where
they are exporting it and on which ships,"" the manager said.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Weak corporate results
jeopardized an eight-day rally in the Dow industrials and
weighed on European stocks on Thursday, overshadowing upbeat
weekly U.S. jobless claims data that boosted the U.S. dollar.
 A stronger greenback has put some selling pressure on
commodity prices. The dollar gained after the U.S. Labor
Department reported an unexpected drop in initial claims for
unemployment benefits to their lowest level in 2-1/2 years.
 ""(Claims) looked good and the market had a muted but
positive reaction to them,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment
officer at Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New
York.
 ""It comes at a time of year where earnings are being
reported and it looks like, at least this morning, we are going
to see a bit of profit taking in the market,"" he said.
 After weeks of generally positive news on the corporate
front that has lifted benchmark indexes to 2-1/2 year highs,
investors have suddenly been presented with a barrage of less
than robust reports.
 The latest reading of U.S. earnings, for instance, showed
that of the companies listed on the Standard & Poor's 500
index, 72 percent of those reporting have beaten analysts' mean
quarterly estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 However, companies such as computer networking equipment
maker Cisco Systems Inc  fell 11.75 percent to $19.45 a
day after warning about dwindling public spending and weaker
margins.
 In Europe, major bank Credit Suisse  missed profit
expectations because of debt charges, and Diageo , the
world's biggest spirits group, missed expectations with just a
9 percent rise in half-year earnings.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 64.64 points,
or 0.53 percent, to 12,175.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> lost 7.06 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,313.82. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 9.88 points, or 0.35
percent, at 2,779.19.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.09
percent, pressured in particular by emerging markets. The EM
sub-index lost 1.89 percent.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was off 0.6 percent,
even with a gain of 2.59 percent for Deutsche Boerse
, which looks set to buy peer NYSE Euronext .
NYSE'S stock fell 2.36 percent in early New York trading.
 Japan's Nikkei closed down 0.1 percent.
 Most developed markets remain in the black for the year
however, with U.S. indexes leading the way, reflecting a shift
this year from emerging markets to developed ones.
 DOLLAR SURGE
 The U.S. dollar's rise accelerated after the weekly jobless
claims report showed a drop to a seasonally adjusted 383,000,
the lowest since July 2008.
 While the U.S. data underpinned the greenback's gains,
investors remain worried about Europe's lack of progress in
tackling a sovereign debt crisis which undermined the euro.
 ""I think this can continue as the run-up in yields is
dollar-supportive and now we're encountering a renewed sense of
fear about euro zone debt issues,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The euro, which hit a 12-week high above $1.38 earlier this
month, struggled as investors drove Portuguese bond yields to
their highest level since the currency was introduced in 1999.
 Portugal is considered at risk of becoming the next euro
zone country to need a bailout. The European Central Bank
stepped in to buy Portuguese bonds to help stabilize the
fragile market.
 The euro fell 1.05 percent to $1.3586  while sterling
dropped 0.45 percent to $1.6031 percent .
 Sterling fell after the Bank of England left interest rates
at a record low. Traders said a recent spike in U.S. yields set
the dollar up for further near-term gains.
 The dollar made 1 percent gains against the Swiss franc,
rising to 0.9670 francs  and rose 0.96 percent against
the yen to 83.15 .
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, renewing their recent
selloff, as traders sold older issues to make room for $16
billion in 30-year bonds in this week's quarterly refunding.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 87 cents, or 1
percent, to $87.58 per barrel. Spot gold prices  fell
$7.54, or 0.55 percent, to $1354.80.

 * Strauss-Kahn says adding yuan could improve stability
 * Global recovery not going in desired direction
(Updates with quotes, panel of experts)
 By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund
chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Thursday the Chinese yuan
should be given a greater role within a restructured
international monetary system.
 Strauss-Kahn, speaking at the IMF's headquarters, said
that adding emerging market countries' currencies such as the
yuan to a basket of currencies that the IMF administers would
benefit the global system and create more stability.
 He warned that without adjustments to the global monetary
system the world could be sowing the seeds of the next crisis,
pointing to widening economic imbalances, large and volatile
capital flows, exchange rate pressures and rapidly growing
excess reserves.
 Strauss-Kahn's remarks about the yuan do not mark a policy
shift for the IMF, which has always urged more participation by
China in the world economy, but it does expand on its stance.
 Its timing was significant because it comes ahead of next
week's meeting in Paris of finance chiefs from the Group of 20
rich and developing nations.
 Strauss-Kahn said he also saw a greater role for the IMF's
Special Drawing Right as a unit of account, but said such a
move would take time and a great deal of international
cooperation to make it work. The SDR is composed of the dollar,
sterling, euro and yen.
 ""Increasing the role of the SDR would clearly require a
major leap in international policy coordination,"" Strauss-Kahn
said. ""For this reason, I expect the global reserve asset
system to evolve only gradually, and along with changes in the
global economy.""
 He said overhauling the global monetary system could
bolster the economic recovery and help avoid future crises.
 Strauss-Kahn's speech comes as debate over the U.S.
dollar's status as the main global reserve currency is set to
intensify amid G20 discussions, especially with emerging market
economies providing most of the world's growth.
 ""In my opinion, reforms to the international monetary
system that help us get to the root of these imbalances could
both bolster the recovery and strengthen the system's ability
to prevent future crises,"" Strauss-Kahn said.
 But bringing the yuan into the SDR is not simple.
 Among the drawbacks is that the yuan is not freely traded
and China's capital markets are largely closed. Beijing has
been expanding a pilot program to encourage use of its currency
in cross-border trade in what economists say is part of a
strategy to raise the currency's profile.
 The SDR is not itself a currency but an IMF accounting
unit. It is only used as a reserve asset by central banks and
is not available to the private sector.
 The IMF's board was cautious about giving the SDR a greater
role saying it ""should not substitute for the efforts underway
to strengthen the international monetary system's stability.""
 Still, members acknowledged that ""an enhanced role for the
SDR could potentially contribute to the long-term stability"" of
the global monetary system.
 An IMF paper released alongside Strauss-Kahn's speech said
the U.S. dollar would remain the most important global reserve
currency ""for the foreseeable future"".
 But the paper noted there was a place within the system for
the SDR to reduce currency volatility and ensure countries have
easier access to foreign exchange funding during crises. It
said that using the SDR to price global trade would provide a
buffer from exchange rate volatility, while the issuance of
SDR-denominated bonds could create a potentially new class of
reserve assets that could involve the private sector.

 WASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund

overhaul of the international monetary system.
 In a speech at the IMF Strauss-Kahn said adding emerging
market countries' currencies, such as the yuan, to a basket of
currencies that the IMF administers could add stability to the
global system.
 He saw a greater role for the IMF's Special Drawing Rights,

 CAIRO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Egypt will take the final decision
on Saturday evening on whether to reopen its stock exchange
after a two-week closure caused by political unrest, the
official news agency said on Thursday.
 The exchange, closed since Jan. 27, is due to reopen on
Sunday. The government has already delayed the reopening once.
 ""The decision to continue suspending trade on the exchange
is possible, but we must wait for the events of tomorrow,
Friday, before we make an official announcement,"" the MENA news

 Organisers of protests seeking to topple the government of
President Hosni Mubarak were looking forward to another major

 The government shut the exchange after countrywide
political protests caused the benchmark index to plunge by 16
percent in two days, and analysts have warned of a renewed
sell-off by spooked investors once trading resumes.
 The regulator on Tuesday said the exchange would suspend
trade for a half hour if its broad 100-share index declined by 5
percent and for even longer if it fell by 10 percent.
 It also said trading on the exchange would end an hour

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on
Thursday, boosted by better-than-expected U.S. employment data,
while the euro slumped as investors worried about Europe's lack
of progress in tackling a sovereign debt crisis.
 Sterling fell against the dollar after the Bank of England
left interest rates at a record low despite chatter about a
possible hike, and traders said a recent spike in U.S. yields
set the dollar up for further near-term gains.
 ""I think this can continue as the run-up in yields is
dollar-supportive and now we're encountering a renewed sense of
fear about euro zone debt issues,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The euro fell 0.9 percent to $1.3605, with support seen
around the $1.3541 100-day moving average.
 Options market signals, though, suggested that further
volatility in euro-dollar trading may be limited, with the
one-month option hitting a five-month low near 10.45 percent.
 Dolan said it would likely take a break of the $1.3450 area
before ""people start targeting $1.30 in the weeks ahead.""
 The dollar also rose 0.9 percent at 83.16 yen, its highest
since Jan. 27 and seventh straight daily gain. Dolan said
higher U.S. yields could lift it to the high 80s, an area last
seen in July.
 Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.6033, off a session low of
$1.6011.
 U.S. JOBLESS CLAIMS FALL
 U.S. growth picked up in late 2010 and expectations of even
brisker expansion this year have driven up bond yields to about
nine-month highs, though the U.S. Federal Reserve has failed to
signal plans to cut short a $600 billion bond-buying program.
 Adding to the optimism, U.S. claims for first-time jobless
benefits fell in the latest week far below forecasts, data
showed.
 The euro, which hit a 12-week high above $1.38 earlier this
month, struggled as investors drove Portuguese bond yields to
their highest level since the currency was introduced in 1999.
 Portugal is considered at risk of becoming the next euro
zone country to need a bailout, and investors are anxious about
a lack of progress by policymakers in addressing a euro zone
debt crisis. European leaders are to meet next month to discuss
bolstering a 440-billion euro bailout fund for troubled
countries.
 Higher-yielding debt from some euro zone issuers came under
selling pressure, but traders said the European Central Bank
(ECB), which had talked about rising price pressures lately,
stemmed the increase by stepping up its bond purchases.
 ""There are downside risks that the ECB may not be prepared
to hike rates, (with) the potential that bondholders may be
forced to take debt haircuts,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency
strategist at Barclays Capital.
 Bundesbank chief Axel Weber, a known policy hawk, will not
succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European
Central Bank, according to reports Wednesday, adding to doubts
that euro zone rates would rise in the near future.

 * Periphery pressured on EFSF reform pessimism

 By William James
 LONDON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank stepped
in to buy Portuguese bonds on Thursday, traders said, after
yields on the country's debt hit euro-era highs on a perceived
lack of progress towards resolving the bloc's year-long crisis.
 Portuguese 10-year bond yields soared to 7.656 percent,
topping the previous record set in November, as market patience
over the lack of a deal on reforms to tackle the debt crisis
wore thin.
 Portugal is seen as the next euro zone country most
vulnerable to requiring a bailout after Greece and Ireland.
 ""A couple of sellers came in yesterday and now the market
wakes up this morning and thinks 'I'm long Portugal, yields are
at their record highs and there's been no resolution -- sell
it',"" a trader said.
 The move prompted the ECB to resume its programme of buying
debt to stabilise the euro zone's most fragile markets, traders
said. Portuguese yields fell back to 7.404 percent, only
slightly higher on the day.
 Traders said the ECB mainly bought Portuguese bonds and not
in large amounts relative to purchases when the programme was
launched. The bank said on Monday it had bought 76.5 bilion
euros of bonds since May, but none in the last two weeks.
 Yields on Portuguese debt have risen for six straight
sessions as disappointment over slow progress towards reform of
the euro zone rescue fund and the poor performance of its
newly-launched benchmark spooked investors.
 ""By all accounts the (EU) summit last week was pretty
acrimonious and there was a bit of finger pointing,"" said Alan
McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers. 
 ""It adds to the impression there is not a unified front
within Europe and in times of uncertainty you're better off in
core rather than peripheral paper.""
 The Portuguese 10-year government bond yield spread over
Germany widened to 440 bps, up more than 30 bps on the day
before reversing direction, falling back to 410 bps on the talk
of ECB buying. 
 Portuguese stocks fell 2.03 percent, far exceeding
a 0.8 percent drop on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300. The
German Bund future gained as a result of the tension, rising as
much as 65 ticks to 122.98.
 Other peripheral bond yields also rose relative to German
debt on a building sense of unease in the periphery, despite
recovering ground as Portuguese spreads tightened.
 
 POOR SYNDICATION
 Traders highlighted Portugal's five-year syndicated bond
sale this week as a sign of waning investor appetite to hold the
country's debt. The bond has traded poorly in the secondary
market, adding to worries over Portugal's ability to access the
market to raise the 18-20 billion euros it has targeted in 2011.
 The indicative bid price on the bond earlier fell as low as
97.29 -- well below the initial reoffer price of 99.762, driving
the yield above 7 percent and leaving investors who bought the
issue potentially holding paper at a loss.
 Peripheral euro zone debt had rallied in late January as
markets grew increasingly confident European Union leaders were
making progress on a deal to strengthen the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), the euro zone bailout fund.
 The 10-year German bond yield was 3.288 percent, down 2.1
bps while the two-year Schatz yield was 0.7 bps lower at 1.449
percent.

 * Telefonica could afford to raise more debt
 * Deal tough sell to investors after big 2010 buys
 
 By Robert Hetz and Elisabeth O'Leary
 MADRID, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Telefonica is interested in
buying Polish mobile firm Polkomtel, but such a deal could be
tough to sell to investors concerned about its sluggish home
market and after a run of big acquisitions last year. 
 Sources familiar with the situation said Telefonica, the
euro zone's biggest telecommunications firm has joined a crowded
field of potential investors studying the possibility of a bid
but it has not decided whether to take part. [ID:nLDE7171GJ
 Telefonica declined to comment.
 The purchase of Poland's top mobile group by sales, worth up
to 4 billion euros, could fit with Telefonica's current holdings
in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
 Telefonica's debt of about 58 billion euros would not, in
principle, be a hindrance.
 ""Debt is 2.3 times core earnings, but it still has
sufficient financial muscle to bid,"" said Virginia Perez,
analyst at brokerage ACF in Madrid. 
 But with Telefonica's core Spanish market under pressure
from 20 percent unemployment and last year's 7.5 billion euro
purchase of Portugal Telecom's stake in Brazil's Vivo fresh in
investors' minds, the firm might opt to keep its powder dry.
 Some analysts question Telefonica's ability to reach
earnings targets and say a purchase could increase this
scepticism.
 ""(Polkomtel) would be a marginal deal either way for
Telefonica, and if it were to be perceived that they were
acquiring a way to reach targets, investors might be sceptical,""
said John Davies, analyst at ING in London.
 
 SPAIN DRAGS
 Telefonica's domestic business has been hit by the end of a
property boom, which has saddled Spaniards with debt and
intensified competition in the telecoms market.
 Analysts already see Telefonica's goal to raise its dividend
25 percent to 1.75 euros per share in 2011/2012 as ambitious.
 Earlier this week, the telecoms group told the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that in the fourth quarter of
2010 ""operations in Spain were affected by difficult economic
conditions, lower consumption and greater price competition.""
 Given that backdrop, Chairman Cesar Alierta might have to
sit tight.
 ""We believe that an acquisition of this size at this time
would likely not be well-received by the market, and would
probably place some pressure on the share price,"" said broker JB
Capital Markets in a note to clients.
 Shares were down 1.4 percent to 18.31 euros at 1058 GMT on
Thursday, having risen 9.4 percent so far this year versus a 6.8
percent gain in the European Stoxx telecoms sector.
 Telefonica announces full year results on Feb. 25.
 Exane BNP Paribas expects a 7.3 percent rise in revenue and
a 46 percent rise in profit, with a large part of that due to a
boost in the valuation of Vivo after the purchase of PT's stake.
 Brokerage Bernstein argues Telefonica could opt to issue new
shares to buy out other European telecoms businesses such as KPN
in The Netherlands, an eternal takeover candidate.
""Another synergy creating deal - a paper deal for KPN - would
almost (but not quite) put the dividend (target) within reach,""
Bernstein said in a research note.
 It said that could entail the merger of Telefonica's O2
Germany and KPN's E-Plus, potentially creating up to 3.5 billion
euros in synergies.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday as nagging doubts over a lack of concrete
policy measures to tackle the euro zone debt crisis hit
sentiment and pushed peripheral debt yields up.
 Sterling fell to a session low against the dollar after the
Bank of England held interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent.
The decision was widely expected, but markets had been pricing
in a small possibility of a rate hike. [ID:nLAC005806]
 The single currency struggled after the yield on 10-year
debt issued by Portugal, seen at risk of becoming the next euro
zone country to need a bailout, hit an all-time high, widening
the spread over its safe-haven German equivalent.
 Traders said an Asian sovereign account sold euros
persistently in early European trade, as market participants
speculated that Asian demand for the single currency seen
earlier in the week had petered out.
 The euro's upward momentum has fizzled as investors wait
until March for details of additional steps to tackle the euro
zone's debt crisis, while markets pare back speculation of a
near-term rise in euro zone interest rates.
 Analysts say renewed concern that bond investors may be
forced to take haircuts on debt issued by weak euro zone
countries holdings could also dampen euro sentiment.
 Higher-yielding debt from some euro zone issuers came under
selling pressure but traders said bond buys from the ECB helped
to calm jitters. [ID:nLDE7190XP]
 ""It looks as if the market has got a bit ahead of itself
with the euro as concrete policy measures to address the debt
crisis are unlikely to materialise before the end of March,""
said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ""There are also downside risks that the ECB may not be
prepared to hike rates as well as the potential that bondholders
may be forced to take debt haircuts,"" he added.
 The euro  was down 0.7 percent against the dollar at
$1.3620, having risen to $1.3745 in U.S. trade on Wednesday.
 In addition to Asian names, an east-European sovereign name
was seen selling the euro. But traders said Middle-Eastern
accounts were buying around the day's low of $1.3616, while key
support was the 100-day moving average at $1.3541.
 Implied options volatilities in euro/dollar, a measure on
the market's view of how much the pair will move in the future,
were trading with a heavy feel. The one-month  slipped
to a five-month low around 10.45 percent.
 Sterling  slipped around 40 pips to a session trough
of $1.6012 before pulling back to $1.6060, 0.3 percent lower on
the day.
 The fall in the euro helped the dollar index to rise 0.6
percent on the day to 78.100. The U.S. currency was up 0.5
percent at 82.80 yen .
 The dollar rose broadly, but traders were wary about bidding
it up too far after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave
no indication that the central bank would cut short its bond
buying programme, let alone raise interest rates down the road.
 
 RATE VIEW SUPPORTS EURO
 The euro showed little initial reaction to comments from
European Central Bank board member Axel Weber, who reiterated
the ECB's commitment to price stability. 
 Weber declined to comment on his own future, after reports
that he is no longer a candidate to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet
as president of the ECB, which has added to doubts that euro
zone rates would rise in the near future. [ID:nLDE7190O8]
 Some analysts argue that while the ECB may not raise rates
immediately, a hike in the coming months remains a possibility
as the central bank has highlighted its pledge to maintain price
stability as inflation expectations gather pace.
 Kathleen Brooks, research director at FOREX.com, said such a
view would provide some support the euro in the near term.
 ""Bar another shock from the sovereign debt crisis (like
Spain needing a bailout), swap rates should remain supported and
the euro should continue to trade with a bullish tone,"" she said
in a note.
 But she added: ""Although the pace of gains especially above
$1.3800 and towards $1.4000 may slow as the prospect of ECB
hikes get pushed out to the future.""

 (Adds comment)
 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England defied
critics and kept interest rates at a record low on Thursday,
judging the threat from rising inflation will prove temporary
and that Britain's recovery remains in doubt.
 Inflation has jumped to almost twice the BoE's target and is
still rising, but the economy faces headwinds from hefty public
spending cuts and suffered a surprise contracted at the end of
last year.
 Strategists had been unanimous in predicting rates would
stay at 0.5 percent -- where they have stood since March 2009 --
and there was little market reaction.
 However, the debate on the BoE's monetary policy committee
will have been heated and investors remain convinced that rates
will rise before long. Money markets show a quarter-point rate
rise is fully priced in by May, with at least one additional
hike by the end of the year.
By May, BoE policymakers will have more information about
how the economy weathered the government's fiscal tightening and
whether a 0.5 percent contraction in the fourth quarter was
largely related to unusually snowy weather.
 James Knightley at ING said Thursday's policy deliberations
would have been hard-fought.
""Despite our worries about the economy there is clearly
growing pressure on the BoE to do something to combat near-term
inflation fears,"" he said.
 
 KEEPING THE FAITH
 The BoE's decision to hold fire will come as a relief to the
government, which is hoping loose monetary policy will cushion
the blow from its fiscal tightening.
 However, it will also heighten criticism that Britain's
central bank is ignoring its price stability mandate. Inflation
has been more than a percentage point above its 2 percent target
for the past year and has been above target around 80 percent of
the time for the past three years.
 The BoE's no-change decision means quarterly inflation
forecasts, to be published next Wednesday, are likely to show
price pressures easing over the medium term. However, after
repeated overshoots, the BoE's line that inflation will be
temporary is wearing thin.
 ""If the Monetary Policy Committee again forecasts sub-target
inflation two to three years ahead with market rates, investors
may again be sceptical, doubting the MPC's inflation forecasts
and hence also doubting their message,"" said Michael Saunders at
Citi.
 BoE Governor Mervyn King warned last month that inflation
could rise as high as 5 percent in the coming months, but
reiterated that slack in the economy should steer inflation back
to target once one-off factors, such as last month's rise in
sales tax, have faded.
 Two other members of the BoE's monetary policy committee,
Andrew Sentance and newcomer Martin Weale, are less confident
however. Both voted for an immediate quarter-point interest rate
rise in January and are likely to have repeated their call this
month.
 A breakdown of this month's vote will be published on Feb.
23 and is likely to show sharp divisions.
 ""Although today's decision means the tail risk of an
immediate rate hike did not crystallise, the question of whether
there will be a tightening in policy over the next few months
remains live,"" said Simon Hayes at Barclays Capital.

 (Adds detail)
 PARIS, Feb 10 (Reuters) - France exported 1.4 million tonnes
of soft wheat in December, pushing up exports in the first half
of the 2010/11 season by 32 percent from a year ago, customs
data showed, as tightening world supply fuelled demand for
French wheat.
 Soft wheat exports reached 10.1 million tonnes in the six
months to end-December versus 7.6 million in the same period of
2009/10, the data showed on Thursday.
 Demand for French wheat on the world market has surged after
adverse weather hit crops in other major producing countries
including Russia.
 The monthly customs data showed that French wheat exports
outside the EU were up 57 percent year-on-year in the six months
at nearly 6.9 million tonnes.
 Farm office FranceAgriMer on Wednesday raised its monthly
forecast for France's non-EU wheat exports this season to a new
record of 12.1 million tonnes.
 Exports to Algeria were up 32 percent on the year and
accounted for 29 percent of total French non-EU exports in the
first half of the season, while sales to Egypt jumped 49 percent
and accounted for a quarter of non-EU exports, the data showed.
 In contrast, French wheat shipments within the EU were down
2 percent on year at 3.2 million tonnes.
 Wheat imports, key this season to compensate for France's
large exports of high-quality wheat, were slightly above 500,000
tonnes, four-and-a-half times the year-earlier level. The
imports were mainly from the EU -- notably Germany, Belgium and
Britain.
 French barley exports in the first half of 2010/11 were at
2.8 million tonnes, up 23 percent, of which almost 779,000
tonnes sold outside the European Union, the data showed.
 Maize exports, which have been hampered by a lack of
competitiveness, dropped 27 percent on the year, while imports
gained 12 percent.

 BRATISLAVA, Feb 10 (Reuters) - German car group Volkswagen
plans to invest 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in Slovakia in
the coming five years to boost car and parts production, the
company's Slovak unit said on Thursday.
 Volkswagen, one of the biggest investors and exporters in
Slovakia, has invested more than 1.7 billion euros in the euro
zone country over the past 20 years.
 Heavily export-reliant Slovakia has introduced structural
market reforms over the past decade and attracted billions of
euros of foreign direct investment, helping to make it one of
the European Union's fastest growing economies.
 ""We will focus on new production technologies and increasing
car production in the Bratislava assembly plant and car-parts
production in the Martin factory,"" the Slovak unit's CEO Andreas
Tostmann said in a handout to media.
 ""This confirms that we are serious about growing in
Slovakia,"" he said.
 The plant near Bratislava produces sport utility vehicle
(SUV) models the Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q7, and parts of the
Porsche Cayenne. It will launch production of a new small family
car later this year.
 ""It confirms that Slovakia is a unique destination for
foreign investment and also that it has a strong position in
terms of car production per capita in Europe,"" senior Volksbank
analyst Vladimir Vano said.
 The car industry, including units of Volkswagen, PSA Peugeot
Citroen and Kia Motors, is among the key drivers of the
63-billion-euro economy, which is expected to grow by around 4
percent in 2010 after contracting in 2009.
 Volkswagen produced 106,000 cars in Slovakia in 2009, down
from 188,000 units the previous year.

 * Dollar's dominance cause of instability-Gyohten
 * 10-15 years before yuan can be added to SDR basket
(Adds quotes)
 By Rie Ishiguro and Shinji Kitamura
 TOKYO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The yen is unlikely to weaken in
the long term due to Japan's persistent deflation, which
translates into stronger purchasing power for its currency, a
former top Japanese currency official said on Thursday.
 ""The yen is unlikely to weaken medium- to long-term as long
as deflation persists, because currency moves tend to be driven
by purchasing power and deflation means that the yen's purchasing
power will become stronger and stronger,"" Toyoo Gyohten told
Reuters in an interview.
 He added that the dollar's dominance was already diminishing
as the euro increases its share in global trade, but Europe's
credit problems have prevented the single currency from being
considered a strong alternative to the dollar.
 ""The dollar's unipolar dominance certainly has been a cause
of instability (in global financial markets) ... The fact that
France and China are discussing the dollar's role reflects
declining trust in the dollar,"" Gyohten said.
 Reform of the global monetary system and changes to the
greenback's role as a reserve currency are expected to be high on
the agenda at the Group of 20 finance chiefs' meeting next week
in Paris.
 Gyohten also said it will likely take 10 to 15 years for the
yuan to be added to the basket of currencies which backs the
IMF's Special Drawing Rights system. This allows members to draw
funds to supplement their reserves and currently comprises
dollars, euros, yen and sterling.
 French officials have suggested setting a timetable for the
yuan's entry into the SDR's basket of currencies could be one
achievement of their presidency of the G20, but Washington is
reluctant to concede this without more yuan exchange rate
flexibility.
 Gyohten was director general of the Ministry of Finance's
international bureau at the time of the Plaza Accord in 1985,
when rich countries agreed to let the dollar depreciate to reduce
the United States' trade deficit.
 He then served as Japan's top currency official until he
retired from the finance ministry in 1989. He now heads Institute
for International Monetary Affairs, a think tank.
 On Japan's tattered public finance, the government's social
security and tax reform package due in June will be the key to
gaining market trust, Gyohten said.
 ""Japan's circumstances are different from other countries as
most of its debts are held by Japanese people and there is room
for tax hikes ... But that will not act as panacea for markets
forever.""

Thursday, but many banks were holding back from large dollar
purchases after Tuesday's intervention from the central bank,
dealers said.
 ""Trade is very slow,"" said a dealer at a Cairo bank, adding
that state-controlled banks had been selling dollars to support
the Egyptian pound .
 The Egyptian pound  had been falling steadily since
political protests broke out on Jan 25, and many traders and
strategists expect more losses. UBS analysts put the potential
decline at as much as 25 percent within a month.
 The pound was trading at 5.887 to the U.S. dollar.
marginally lower than Wednesday's close of 5.8775 but stronger
than the six-year low of 5.960 reached before the central bank
intervention on Tuesday.
 Egypt's central bank said on Wednesday it was prepared to
intervene directly in the currency market again after Tuesday's
intervention if it sees the need.
 Traders said the central bank had intervened without dipping
into foreign reserves, and one trader estimated the size of the
intervention at ""not less than $1 billion and not more than $1.6
billion."" [ID:nLDE71812B]
 The intervention boosted the currency as much as 1.4
percent.
 One trader estimated that volume on the interbank currency
market on Wednesday had fallen to about $300 million from
$1.6-1.7 billion on Sunday and $1 billion on Monday before the
intervention.
 Traders put volume in normal times at $300-400 million.
 The central bank is due to announce the results later today
of an auction of 3.5 billion Egyptian pounds in 182-day treasury
bills, its second since political protests forced Egypt's banks
and treasury rooms to close for five days last week. 
 Egypt's central bank accepted fewer bids than treasury bills
it offered on Monday in an oversubscribed auction that received
no foreign bids, suggesting demand has been knocked lower by two
weeks of political turmoil.

 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Weak corporate earnings weighed
on global stocks on Thursday and worries over the Saudi king's
health ratcheted political tensions up another notch in the
Middle East, keeping Brent crude prices above $100 a barrel.
 Major European markets were down more than half a percent
while stock futures indicated a weaker opening on Wall Street,
though better-than-expected data on U.S. weekly jobless claims
helped U.S. stock futures pare some losses.
 U.S. Treasury yields also rose and the dollar gained against
the euro after data showed new claims for unemployment benefits
dropped more than expected last week to touch their lowest point
in 2-1/2 years.
 The data ""looked good and the market had a muted but
positive reaction to them. Anecdotally, we do hear that there is
some improvement on the jobs front and this is another
indication of that,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer
at Solaris Asset Management.
 Earlier, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at
0.5 percent as expected, soothing bond markets but briefly
pushing sterling lower after markets had priced in an outside
chance of a hike.
 Britain's FTSE 100 index was down 0.9 percent. The
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 0.7 percent
despite a boost from Deutsche Boerse, which looks set to buy
peer NYSE Euronext.
 After weeks of generally positive news on the corporate
front, investors have suddenly been presented with a barrage of
less than robust reports, shaking some of the optimism over the
global economic recovery.
 Credit Suisse missed profit expectations and Diageo, the
world's biggest spirits group, missed expectations with a 9
percent rise in half-year earnings. Credit Suisse shares fell
over 5 percent.
 U.S. tech giant Cisco Systems Inc posted quarterly results
after the New York market close on Wednesday, beating profit and
sales expectations but with disappointing margins.
 Its stock fell nearly 10 percent in extended trading.
 ""Most earnings themselves have been supportive, but if you
look at the guidance and the impact of inflationary pressure,
what is almost certain is that this will have an impact on
profit margins,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at
Charles Stanley.
 MSCI's all-country world index was down 0.4 percent,
pressured in particular by emerging market losses. The EM
sub-index lost 1.8 percent
 Traders said a weak bond auction in Portugal was also
weighing on sentiment. Yields rose above 7.4 percent on 10-year
paper, well above the 7 percent many consider as the limit for
sustainable servicing of the country's debt.
 ""Portuguese spreads are widening, making some traders
nervous again,"" senior trader at ETX trading Markus Huber said.
""On top of somewhat disappointing earnings, from Credit Suisse
for example, this is weighing on investor sentiment,"" he added.
 In the United States, data showed new unemployment benefit
claims at lowest point in 2-1/2 years. That helped futures pare
losses, with S&P futures down 6.5 points compared to 7 just
before the data.
 Dow Jones industrial average futures tumbled 44 points and
Nasdaq 100 futures were off 16.75 points. 
 U.S. earnings due on Thursday include Expedia, Goodyear Tire
& Rubber Co. Kraft and Philip Morris.

CRUDE UP, EURO DOWN
 The weak Portuguese auction also hit the euro, which fell
against the dollar. Analysts said the lack of concrete policy
measures to tackle the euro zone debt crisis was weighing on
sentiment on the single currency and peripheral bonds.
Investors must wait until March to hear details of steps to
tackle the crisis, and speculation of a near-term rise in euro
zone interest rates also is being pared back.
 The euro eased 0.7 percent against the dollar to $1.3620
ahead of the U.S. data, dipping further to 1.3593 by 1354 GMT.
 ""There are... downside risks that the European Central Bank
may not be prepared to hike rates and the potential that
bondholders may be forced to take debt haircuts,"" said Barclays
currency strategist Raghav Subbarao.
 Sterling fell after the BoE meeting where rates were held
steady even though UK inflation is almost twice the targeted
rate.
 Sterling fell to a session low of $1.6012 soon after the
announcement from around $1.6053. It recouped those losses, but
was still 0.3 percent down for the day. March gilt futures were
up 25 ticks to 115.65, giving up some of the modest gains
immediately after the decision.
 On oil markets, Brent crude oil futures stayed above $102 a
barrel as investors remained concerned that unrest in Tunisia
and Egypt could ignite similar protests in bigger oil producers
such as Libya -- or even Saudi Arabia.
 Rumours the Saudi King Abdullah was seriously ill also
triggered buying, the fears felling a surge in Saudi credit

U.S. crude however remained at $86 a barrel, the gap between

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday on selling from a major Asian sovereign
account, while nagging doubts over a lack of concrete policy
measures to tackle the euro zone debt crisis hit sentiment.
 A boost the previous day from falling U.S. bond yields
proved short-lived amid expectations that the euro will stick to
its well-worn range versus the greenback in the near-term.
 Traders said an Asian sovereign account sold euros
persistently from the European open. An east-European sovereign
name was also seen selling.
 The euro lacked upward momentum as markets looked set to
wait until March for details of additional steps to tackle the
euro zone's debt crisis, amid renewed concerns that bond
investors may be forced to take haircuts on the euro zone
holdings.
 ""It looks as if the market has got a bit ahead of itself
with the euro as concrete policy measures to address the debt
crisis are unlikely to materialise before the end of March,""
said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ""There are also downside risks that the ECB may not be
prepared to hike rates as the potential that bondholders may be
forced to take debt haircuts,"" he added.
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi said on Wednesday debt haircuts would immediately result
in a run on banks.
 The euro was down 0.6 percent against the dollar at $1.3646
having risen to $1.3745 in U.S. trade on Wednesday. ""It's
difficult for now for the euro to rise above the peak it hit
earlier this month. It will need a fresh factor to push it
beyond that high,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko
Cordial Securities.
 Reports on Wednesday that Bundesbank chief Axel Weber, a
known policy hawk, would not succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as
President of the European Central Bank, added to doubts that
euro zone rates would rise in the near future.
 
 DOVISH BERNANKE
 Traders were equally wary about bidding the dollar up too
far after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave no
indication that the central bank would cut short its bond buying
programme, let alone raise interest rates down the road.
 Bernanke, testifying in Congress, acknowledged renewed
momentum in the economy, saying a drop in the jobless rate to 9
percent was grounds for optimism while adding that hiring was
still anaemic.
 U.S. Treasury yields fell from nine-month highs, with an
auction of 10-year bonds drawing strong foreign demand.
 The fall in the euro helped the dollar index to rise 0.5
percent on the day to 78.027. It was up 0.3 percent at 82.70 yen
.
 With both euro/dollar and dollar/yen seen in a holding
pattern, some speculators are now selling options in the two
pairs -- essentially betting against sharp moves -- rather than
making directional bets.
 That pushed one-month implied volatility on euro/dollar to a
five-month low, while one-month dollar/yen volatility was
flirting with three-year lows.
 Sterling was down 0.3 percent versus the dollar at $1.6060
as traders adjusted positions ahead of the Bank of England
interest rate announcement at 1200 GMT.
 While most analysts expect the bank to stand pat this time,
money markets are pricing in about a 20 percent chance of a rate
hike on Thursday and a 100 percent chance by May.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.0046 after jobs
data showed that more jobs than expected were created despite
the floods in Queensland, although full-time employment fell,
which some traders said prompted profit-taking.

 By Leila Abboud
 PARIS, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Long-troubled telecom equipment
maker Alcatel-Lucent sparked investor hopes it had turned a
corner when it kept an ambitious free cash flow target and
reassured on its 2011 profitability.
 Shares in the Franco-American group shot up more than 13
percent to their highest level since October 2009, making it the
French CAC 40 index's biggest gainer on Thursday.
 Chief Executive Ben Verwaayen, a Dutchman who formerly led
BT Group before taking over Alcatel-Lucent in September 2008,
said the results showed that the group was on track to complete
his promised three-year turnaround.
 ""We had the best profits this quarter since the merger and
it's a clear indication that we are on our way to becoming a
normal company going into 2011"", he said in a call with
reporters on Thursday.
 Verwaayen was brought in to rescue Alcatel-Lucent, which
competes with larger rivals Ericsson of Sweden and China's
Huawei, and restore it to profitability after it was rocked by a
value-destroying merger in 2006.
 But the economic downturn led telecom operators to slash
spending and last year's results were hit by a shortage of
components that weighed on profits.
 Alcatel-Lucent set an adjusted operating margin target of 5
percent of 2011 sales, the lower end of the 5 to 9 percent range
that it has previously told investors it would hit in 2011.
 Asked whether the 9 percent was now out of reach, Verwaayen
said he did not exclude it.
 ""There is clear momentum in the market and for us as a
company,"" said Verwaayen. ""We feel confident that we will grow
faster than our addressable market and aim at a significant
increase in profitability.""
 Investors hailed the forecast-beating fourth quarter and
signs that the fixed-line business was taking off again.
Analysts from CA Cheuvereux and WestLB raised their
recommendations on the shares, while Credit Suisse and Goldman
Sachs said they were reviewing their estimates.
 ""We think the company now appears much more credible as a
restructuring play, which should profit from market growth this
year,"" wrote Thomas Langer of WestLB in a note.
 
 GROWTH AHEAD
 Alcatel-Lucent said the global market for telecom gear would
grow in the high end of the previously predicted 0 to 5 percent
range this year.
 Market research firms have forecast 1.6 to 2.5 percent
growth in telecom operators capital spending this year, as a
boom in smartphones and tablets overload networks with data.
 Alcatel-Lucent's full-year revenues for 2010 were up 5.5
percent to 15.996 billion euro ($21.90 billion), while its
adjusted operating income was 288 million euro.
 Analysts had expected 2010 revenues would be up 3.8 percent
to 15.74 billion euro. 
 The group had an adjusted operating margin of 1.8 percent in
2010, the lower end of a 1 to 5 percent range for which it was
aiming.
 The fourth quarter brought a 22 percent increase in
revenues, boosted by strong sales in North America. The group's
adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 8.1 percent
of sales.
 Alcatel-Lucent earns about one third of its revenues in the
region through big contracts with AT&T and Verizon.
 U.S. operators are investing heavily in fourth-generation
wireless rollouts to cope with an explosion in data traffic.
 But Alcatel-Lucent struggled to convert higher sales last
year in to strong cash flows because of troublesome shortage of
electronic components that forced it to stockpile parts.
 As a result, it did not deliver on its pledge to break even
on a free cash flow basis this year. Instead, it saw negative
free cash flow of 818 million euros, according to Chief
Financial Officer Paul Tufano.
 ""We increased our inventory dramatically as we suffered from
component shortages,"" he explained. ""But we plan to keep
reducing inventory this year, and still aim for positive free
cash flow in 2011.""
 Signalling some improvement, free cash flow in the fourth
quarter was positive 319 million euros.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the dollar
on Thursday, pressured by fading prospects for a European Central
Bank rate hike while a boost the previous day from falling U.S.
bond yields proved short-lived, fuelling expectations that it
will stick to its well-worn range.
 Traders instead focused on the British pound, which was
well-supported ahead of the Bank of England's policy announcement
at 1200 GMT, as speculation lingered of a surprise rate hike.
 The euro, in contrast, lacked momentum after the European
Central Bank chief last week quelled expectations of a near-term
rate hike, which toppled the currency from a 12-week high.
 ""It's difficult for now for the euro to rise above the peak
it hit earlier this month. It will need a fresh factor to push it
beyond that high,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko
Cordial Securities.
 The euro slipped to $1.3694 , down about 0.3 percent
from late U.S. levels.
 Although the fall in U.S. yields helped the currency rise
sharply on Wednesday, it has failed to make a sustainable break
above resistance around $1.3740, a 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of its fall from November to January.
 ""I expect the euro to stay in a boxed range between $1.35 and
$1.38 for the time being,"" said Nikko's Matsumoto, reflecting the
view of many market players.
 Many traders are also wary about bidding the dollar up too
far after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave no
indication that the central bank would cut short its bond buying
programme, let alone raise interest rates down the road.
 That, combined with strong foreign demand at a 10-year U.S.
bond auction, helped to drive U.S. yields from a nine-month high
and undermined the greenback on Wednesday.
 Bernanke, testifying in Congress, acknowledged renewed
momentum in the economy, saying a drop in the jobless rate to 9
percent was grounds for optimism while adding that hiring was
still anaemic.
 TREASURY YIELDS
 U.S. Treasury yields fell from nine-month highs, with an
auction of 10-year bonds drawing strong foreign demand, helping
to widen the euro's yield advantage over the dollar.
 The two-year German-U.S. yield spread, which has had a high
correlation with the euro-dollar rate, rose to 0.64 point from a
three-week low of 0.55 hit on Tuesday.
 German bond yields and euro zone short-term interest rates
also climbed despite reports that hawkish ECB policy maker Axel
Weber, the head of the Bundesbank, had pulled out of the race for
the presidency of the ECB. [ID:nLDE7180MQ]
 ""It is true that Weber is one of the most hawkish
policymakers. But the market seems to be leaning to the view that
the ECB's policy direction will not be that different even if
Weber doesn't take the helm,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the yen, with buying by
Japanese corporates helping to lift it to a nearly two-week high
of 82.72 yen .
 Many traders said that heavy offers from Japanese exporters
as well as repatriation flows from Japanese companies will likely
keep the pair below 83 yen in the near future.
 With both euro/dollar and dollar/yen seen in a holding
pattern, some speculators are now selling options in the two
pairs -- essentially betting against sharp moves -- rather than
making directional bets.
 That pushed one-month implied volatility on euro/dollar to a
five-month low , while one-month dollar/yen volatility
was flirting with three-year lows .
 The British pound held on to Wednesday's 0.2 percent gain to
trade at $1.6100 , ahead of the Bank of England's
policy-setting meeting later in the day.
 While many currency traders expect the bank to stand pat this
time, money markets are pricing in about a 20 percent chance of a
rate hike on Thursday and a 100 percent chance by May.
[ID:nLDE7181WS]
 Sterling could fall if the Bank of England does not take
action, although expectations of an early hike are likely to
support the pound, some traders said.
 ""Among major central banks, the Bank of England is likely to
be the first to raise rates,"" said Sumino Kamei, senior analyst
at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi-UFJ.
 The dollar's index against a basket of currencies stood at
77.789 <.DXY> <=USD>, up 0.2 percent on the day.
 The Australian dollar  fell after jobs data showed
that more jobs than expected were created despite the floods in
Queensland, although full-time employment fell, which some
traders said prompted profit-taking. The Aussie slipped to
$1.0070, down 0.5 percent on the day.

 By Ivana Sekularac
 AMSTERDAM, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Dutch food group Nutreco gave
no earnings outlook when it reported better-than-expected 2010
operating profit on Thursday, adding to uncertainty over the
impact of raw materials price rises in 2011.
 Nutreco said 2010 underlying earnings before interest, tax
and amortisation (EBITA) rose 27 percent to 222.5 million euros
($304 million). The average expectation for underlying EBITA was
207 million euros.
 ""The most striking thing is that the company did not give
the outlook and it might be interpreted by the market as a sign
of uncertainty because of rising prices of raw materials,"" ABN
AMRO analyst Maarten Bakker said. ""That will weigh on the
sentiment.""
 Nutreco has passed on higher prices to farmers in 2010,
boosting its earnings, but concerns about rising raw materials
prices have heightened in recent weeks, hurting its shares.
 Based on Wednesday's close, Nutreco's shares have fallen 11
percent to 53.50 euros from an all-time high of 60.73 euros on
Dec. 16.
 
 HIGHER COSTS
 Nutreco, the world's fifth-largest compound feed producer,
competes with Provimi, Norvite Animal Nutrition Company, Cargill
, Alltech, DSM and Danisco, which has been agreed to be bought
by DuPont.
 The company reported net profit of 113 million euros, up
21.5 percent, but below the average forecast of 128 million on a
9.5 percent rise in sales to 4.94 billion euros.
 ""Operating earnings are in line with expectations, but
higher restructuring charges and higher financial expenses
result in net profit some 10 percent below our estimate,"" said
Richard Withagen, an analyst with SNS Securities.
 ""Overall slightly disappointing,"" he added.
 The company, which produces animal and fish feed and is a
major poultry processor, said in its compound feed business it
had been able to pass on raw materials price rises to customers.
 In its fish feed business, Nutreco said it benefitted from
improved volumes in Norway and a recovering volumes in Chile, a
region hit by fish disease problems in recent years.
 The company also announced changes in its management board,
saying Chief Financial Officer Cees van Rijn will retire as of
Sept. 1, 2011 and be replaced by Gosse Boon.
 It also announced the merger of the agriculture and
specialties divisions into a new animal nutrition unit, cutting
the number of its board members to four from five.

 SYDNEY, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Asian stocks suffered a second
session of sharp losses on Thursday, while the dollar struggled
to make much headway after the U.S. central bank chief signalled
the recovery in the world's biggest economy was still fragile.	
 European stocks, however, were expected to open slightly
higher, according to financial bookmakers. 
 Worries about further interest rate hikes in China and
whether authorities in emerging Asia can tackle inflation
without derailing longer-term growth have prompted investors to
lock in profits on some of last year's best performing markets.	
 Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.1 percent, while shares
elsewhere in Asia slid 1.3 percent, wiping out
this year's gains to reach lows not seen since late December.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.7 percent, South
Korea's KOSPI lost 1.8 percent and Singapore's Straits
Times Index shed 1.2 percent.	
 Last year's laggards like the Nikkei, however, remained well
in the black for the year as investors rotated into some
developed markets from emerging ones.	
 ""It's not like buying in Japanese stocks has completely
stopped, but investors have been looking for a reason to take
profits and now they're cautious about overheating in the
market,"" said Norikazu Kitta, strategist at Nikko Cordial
Securities.	
 Despite the generally downbeat mood, there were patchy
bright spots in the market. Among them, shares in Australian
bourse operator ASX jumped 4.7 percent, while Singapore
Exchange gained 0.7 percent. 
 Investors are hoping that merger news between major bourses
like the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse would boost prospects
for Singapore Exchange's $7.9 billion takeover bid for ASX,
which is facing political hurdles in Australia.	
 
 Rio Tinto put on 0.3 percent ahead of its December
half results. After the Australian market close, the global
miner reported a record second-half profit that more than
doubled from a year earlier. 
 Investors, however, pushed SingTel shares down 1.6
percent after the telecom company unveiled a 2.2 percent fall in
quarterly profit. 
 
 DOLLAR SUBDUED	
 Meanwhile, the dollar index , which tracks the
greenback's performance against a basket of major currencies,
edged up 0.2 percent to 77.786 after a steep decline overnight.	
 Many traders still think the dollar is in a holding pattern
for the near term as the euro was also lacking upward momentum
of its own after the European Central Bank last week quelled
expectations of an early rate hike.	
 The euro traded at $1.3690 , retreating from a
one-week high around $1.3744 set a day earlier.	
 ""It's difficult for now for the euro to rise above the peak
hit earlier this month. It will need a fresh factor to go beyond
that peak,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko Cordial
Securities.	
 Also under pressure, the Australian dollar hit
one-week lows at $1.0074 even after another solid jobs report as
investors bet the numbers were not strong enough to make a rate
rise more likely anytime soon. [ID:L3E7D92LY]	
 U.S. crude futures drifted up 0.2 percent to $86.87 a
barrel, and Brent crude rose above $102, supported by
ongoing tension in Egypt and tighter North Sea supplies.	
 Gold edged down to $1,361.30 an ounce, well off a
lifetime high around $1,430 hit in December, while copper, which
hit an all-time high of $10,160 per tonne on Monday, traded at
$9,970 .

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The euro was supported on Thursday
after climbing the previous day against the dollar on a fall in
U.S. bond yields, though many traders said it lacks the momentum
to extend gains beyond a 12-week peak set last week.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave no indication the
central bank would cut short its bond buying programme, let
alone raise interest rates down the road.
 That and strong foreign demand at a 10-year U.S. bond
auction helped drive U.S. yields off a nine-month high and
undermined the greenback, though traders hesitated to bid the
euro too much after the European Central Bank's chief quelled
expectations of an early rate hike last week.
 ""It's difficult for now for the euro to rise above the peak
it hit earlier this month. It will need a fresh factor to push
it beyond that high,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at
Nikko Cordial Securities.
 The euro traded at $1.3710, down about 0.2 percent from late
U.S. levels but still up about nearly one percent on the week.
 It is facing resistance at around $1.3740, a 61.8 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its fall from November to January. The
next upside target is around $1.3765, the euro's low on Feb. 2.
 ""I expect the euro to stay in a boxed range between $1.35
and $1.38 for the time being,"" said Nikko's Matsumoto,
reflecting views of many market players.
 Bernanke, testifying in Congress, acknowledged renewed
momentum in the economy, saying a drop in the jobless rate to 9
percent was ""grounds for optimism"", but said hiring is still
anaemic.
 U.S. Treasury yields fell from nine-month highs, with an
auction of 10-year bonds drawing strong foreign demand, helping
to widen the euro's yield advantage over the dollar.
 The two-year German-U.S. yield spread, which has had a high
correlation with the euro-dollar, rose to 0.64 point from a
three-week low of 0.55 hit on Tuesday.
 German bond yields and euro zone short-term interest rates
also climbed despite reports that hawkish ECB policy maker Axel
Weber, the head of the Bundesbank, had pulled out of the race
for the presidency of the ECB.
 ""It is true that Weber is one of the most hawkish
policymakers. But the market seems to be leaning to the view
that the ECB's policy direction will not be that different even
if Weber doesn't take the helm,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief
FX strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro stayed near a 10-week high
of 1.3190 franc hit on Wednesday. It was last quoted around
1.3145 francs.
 The dollar rose a tad against the Japanese yen, on buying
from Japanese corporates, though it failed to rise above
Wednesday's high of 82.68 yen, which was its highest since Jan.
28. It last traded at around 82.53 yen, up 0.2 percent.
 Many traders said that meeting heavy offers from Japanese
exporters as well as repatriation flows from Japanese companies
will likely keep the pair below 83 yen in the near future.
 The British pound kept Wednesday's 0.2 percent gain to trade
at $1.6100, ahead of the Bank of England's policy-setting
meeting later in the day.
 While many currency traders expect the bank to stand pat
this time, money markets are pricing in about a 20 percent

 The dollar's index against a basket of currencies stood at
77.727, little changed on the day and about 1 percent above its
three-month low of 76.881 hit last week, which is seen as major
support now.
 The Australian dollar fell after jobs data showing more jobs
than expected were created despite the floods in Queensland, but
full-time employment fell, which some traders said prompted
profit-taking. The Aussie slipped to $1.0085, down 0.3 percent
on the day.

 By Pedro da Costa and Mark Felsenthal
 WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke on Wednesday warned against sharp cuts in U.S.
spending at a time when the economic recovery is still fragile
enough to require extraordinary support from the central bank.
 Even as he warned about the need for a long-term plan to
address ""unsustainable"" budget deficits, Bernanke said steep
reductions in government outlays could compromise growth at a
time when employment is just beginning to rebound.
 ""The cost to the recovery would outweigh the benefits in
terms of fiscal discipline,"" Bernanke told the House of
Representatives' Budget Committee. ""I think we really need to
take a long-term view.""
 Bernanke offered few clues into whether the Fed might
extend its controversial policy of buying $600 billion in
government bonds beyond its June deadline, nor did he signal
any inclination to cut the program short.
 The Fed launched the bond-buying plan in November in an
attempt to keep long-term borrowing costs down and support a
fragile economic rebound.
 Acknowledging renewed momentum in the economy, Bernanke
said a drop in the jobless rate to 9 percent in January from
9.8 percent in November, the biggest two-month decline since
1958, was ""grounds for optimism.""
 However, he said hiring is still anemic and noted that the
economy has made up just over one million of the more than
eight million jobs lost during the recession.
 ""This gain was ... not enough to significantly erode the
wide margin of slack that remains in our labor market,"" he
said. ""Until we see a sustained period of stronger job
creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly
established.
 In separate remarks, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart
indicated the bar will be relatively high for extending the
Fed's bond purchases beyond June, even if he appeared to think
the economy is still relatively vulnerable. [ID:nN09230398]
 ""It depends entirely on the state of the economy and if I
take my base case forecast, which continues the moderate rate
of growth through 2011 and for 2012, I'm not sure it will be
necessary,"" Lockhart told reporters after a speech to a group
of professional accountants.
 Brian Sack, head of the powerful New York Fed markets group
charged with implementing Fed policy, sounded a similar note.
""The issue for the prospect of an additional round of asset
purchases would need to be calibrated with whether it is
appropriate given the shift in the economic outlook.""

 BERNANKE PING-PONG
 Both Democrats and Republicans tried to get Bernanke to
back their views on how best to attack a budget deficit that is
expected to hit a record $1.5 trillion this year. Republicans
want to rein in outlays and ward off any tax increases;
Democrats are wary of cutting spending too deeply now.
 Bernanke offered a fig leaf to both sides, supporting lower
taxes on the one hand while maintaining that short-term budget
reductions should not be too radical.
 ""It's really a question of convincing the market that
there's a long-term plan here,"" Bernanke said, adding that
budget cuts should be done in a ""growth-friendly"" way.
 He said Congress should consider closing corporate tax
loopholes to broaden the tax base so that the corporate tax
rate could be reduced. He also repeated a warning about the
dire consequences of not lifting the country's debt ceiling.
 Asked about the future of government-sponsored enterprises
like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Bernanke said government
backing for the mortgage sector should be a last resort, not
common practice. For more, see: [ID:nN09172003]
 Just across the street, Fed nemesis Ron Paul, who has
called for the central bank to be abolished, was holding his
first hearing as chairman of a House committee on monetary
affairs.
 Paul reiterated some of his unvarnished criticism of
Bernanke and, after the hearing, took the time to sign copies
of his book, called ""End the Fed"". Paul said Bernanke ""is
really cocky"" about plans to unwind the toxic assets the Fed
took on from troubled banks during the height of the 2007-2009
crisis. [ID:nN09212473]
 DEFENDING THE FED
 Part of the skepticism from Congress comes from the Fed's
aggressive bond-buying program, which many Republicans have
argued is potentially inflationary. These concerns were again
on display Wednesday as Bernanke made his first appearance
before a House committee since Republicans assumed control of
the chamber last month.
 The discourse was generally civil, although some of the
questions were pointed.
 The panel's chairman, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of
Wisconsin, opened the hearing by criticizing the Fed for
providing the fuel for future bubbles and inflation, suggesting
the bond purchases were eroding the dollar's value.
 ""There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to
its citizens than debase its currency,"" Ryan said.
 Pressed by skeptical lawmakers, Bernanke said the Fed
regularly reviews its bond buying, but also indicated he feels
it is still needed. He repeated that it would take four to five
years for unemployment to return to more ""normal"" levels closer
to 5 percent.
 ""The chairman continues to deliver the same message of
caution and patience despite the better-than-expected data flow
observed in recent months,"" said Michael Gapen, economist at
Barclays Capital in New York.
 Bernanke said U.S. inflation remains quite low, a tough
message to deliver amid headlines of rising food and commodity
costs across the globe. He also said expectations of future
inflation had remained ""stable,"" suggesting little worry that
an inflationary psychology was building.

 SYDNEY, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia's developed
markets succumbed to a bit of profit taking on Thursday, while
the dollar struggled after the head of the Federal Reserve
signalled the U.S. economic recovery was still fragile and
warned against sharp spending cuts.	
 Commodity prices including crude oil were subdued after Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested U.S. economic conditions were
still too weak for the central bank to pull back on its vast
monetary stimulus.	
 Japan's Nikkei was little changed, having dipped
into negative territory earlier, while shares elsewhere in Asia
shed 0.2 percent. South Korea's KOSPI
fell 0.4 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index
was flat.	
 Among the bright spots, shares in Australian bourse operator
ASX jumped more than 4 percent. 
 Investors are hoping that merger news between major bourses
like the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse would boost prospects
of ASX's own planned merger with Singapore Exchange ,
which is facing political hurdles.	
 
 The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's
performance against a basket of major currencies, was still
shaky at 77.687, having suffered a steep decline overnight.	
 Still, many traders think the dollar is in a holding pattern
for the near term as the euro was also lacking upward momentum
of its own after the European Central Bank last week quelled
expectations of an early rate hike.	
 The euro traded at $1.3717 , down slightly from late
U.S. Levels but still up about 1 percent on the week.	
 ""It's difficult for now for the euro to rise above the peak
hit earlier this month. It will need a fresh factor to go beyond
that peak,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko Cordial
Securities.	
 The Australian dollar dipped slightly in the wake
of solid jobs numbers as investors bet they were not so strong
as to make a rate rise more likely anytime soon. [ID:L3E7D92LY]

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive
against the euro on Thursday after Treasury yields fell on
comments by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that its bond buying
programme would continue and strong auction results.
 Still many traders think the dollar is in a holding pattern
for the near term as the euro also lacks upward momentum on its
own after the European Central Bank chief quelled expectations of
an early rate hike last week.
 ""It's difficult for now for the euro to rise above the peak
hit earlier this month. It will need a fresh factor to go beyond
that peak,"" said Keiji Matsumoto, a strategist at Nikko Cordial
Securities.
 The euro traded at $1.3720, down slightly from late U.S.
levels but still up about 1 percent on the week.
 It is facing resistance at around $1.3740, a 61.8 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its fall from November to January. The
next upside target is around $1.3765, the euro's low on Feb. 2.
 ""I expect the euro to stay in a boxed range between $1.35 and
$1.38 for the time being,"" said Nikko's Matsumoto, reflecting
views of many market players.
 Bernanke, testifying in Congress, acknowledged renewed
momentum in the economy, saying a drop in the jobless rate to 9
percent was ""grounds for optimism"", but said hiring is still
anaemic.
 U.S. Treasury yields fell from nine-month highs, with an
auction of 10-year bonds drawing strong foreign demand, helping
to widen the euro's yield advantage over the dollar.
 The two-year German-U.S. yield spread, which has had a high
correlation with the euro-dollar, rose to 0.64 point from a
three-week low of 0.55 hit on Tuesday.
 German bond yields and euro zone short-term interest rates
also rose despite reports that hawkish ECB policy maker Axel
Weber, the head of the Bundesbank, had pulled out of the race for
ECB presidency.
 ""It is true that Weber is one of the most hawkish
policy-makers. But the market seems to be leaning to the view
that the ECB's policy direction will not be that different even
if Weber doesn't take the helm,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro stayed near a 10-week high
of 1.3190 franc hit on Wednesday. It was last quoted around
1.3145 francs.
 Falls in U.S. yields pressured the dollar against other
currencies, including the yen.
 Although the dollar rose as high as 82.68 yen on Wednesday,
its highest since Jan. 28, it quickly slipped back to around
82.43 yen, meeting heavy offers from Japanese exporters.
 The British pound kept Wednesday's 0.2 percent gains to trade
at $1.6100, ahead of the Bank of England's policy-setting meeting
later in the day.
 The dollar's index against a basket of currencies stood at
77.637, little changed on the day and about 1 percent above its
three-month low of 76.881 hit last week, which is seen as a major
support now.
 The Australian dollar fell after jobs data showing more jobs
than expected were created despite the floods in Queensland, but
full-time employment fell, which some traders said prompted
profit-taking. The Aussie slipped to $1.0085, down 0.3 percent on
the day.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks sold off
on Wednesday as investors fretted about inflation in the
developing world while the U.S. dollar fell after remarks by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke pushed bond yields down.
 The dollar fell against the euro after a strong auction of
U.S. Treasury debt accelerated bearish sentiment in the wake of
Bernanke's comments, which indicated the U.S. central bank's
$600 billion bond-buying program remains intact. For details
see: [ID:nN09192971]
 ""Bernanke is telling you that the Fed is not going to rush
to raise rates, and that's why the dollar sold off,"" said David
Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in New York.
 The euro  gained 0.72 percent at $1.3731, and the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, a basket of major currencies, was
down 0.52 percent.
 Investors embraced government bonds, drawn by higher yields
and encouraged by a 10-year U.S. Treasury note auction that
apparently attracted record foreign demand. [ID:nN09579634]
 The so-called indirect bid, which roughly correlates to
demand from overseas investors, dominated the auction, taking
71.3 percent of the sale. The norm is about 44 percent, said
Ian Lyngen, senior government bond strategist at CRT Capital
Group in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose
20/32 in price to yield 3.66 percent.
 Stocks in Tokyo were poised to open lower, with the March
futures contract that trades in Chicago for the Nikkei 225
<0#NK:> down 65 points at 10,630.
 Investors dumped emerging market shares after Brazil said
it will cut 50 billion reais ($30 billion) from its budget this
year to slow surging inflation and an overheated economy. For
details see: [ID:nN09134882]
 The announcement came on the heels of China's raising of
interest rates on Tuesday to subdue stubbornly high inflation
and curb its fast-expanding economy. 
 MSCI's emerging market index fell 1.5 percent, led by a 2.4
percent decline in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index <.BVSP>
Since the emerging market index peaked in mid-January at highs
last seen in June 2008, it has declined more than 5 percent.
 The slide in developing world assets contrasted with U.S.
stocks, where the tech-rich Nasdaq and broad S&P 500 index
fell. But the iconic Dow industrials eked out an eighth
straight session of gains, lifted by a late-hour rally in Bank
of America 
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> is up about
4 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained about
5 percent since the beginning of 2011.
 Investors expressed confidence that solid corporate
earnings will spur further U.S. stock advances, but a recent
string of lightly traded sessions raised worries that buying
interest at these levels has dried up.
 ""We've had such a great run that we're seeing some
profit-taking even though there's really no information out
there that's taking us down,"" said Tom Wirth, senior investment
officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co, which manages $1.5 billion
in Elmira, New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 6.74
points, or 0.06 percent, at 12,239.89. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 3.69 points, or 0.28 percent, at
1,320.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slipped 7.98
points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,789.07.
 Dow components Walt Disney Co  and Coca-Cola Co
 advanced after reporting strong quarterly sales. Disney
was the strongest performer on the index, surging 5.3 percent
to $43.36 and Coke gained 0.4 percent to $63.15. For details,
see [ID:nN0883045] and [ID:nN08101124]
 Brent crude jumped nearly 2 percent to near $102 a barrel
as the dollar fell and unrest in Egypt stoked supply worries,
while high inventories pushed down U.S. crude and widened the
spread between the two contracts to record levels.
 The U.S. inventory builds helped push Brent's premium over
the U.S. crude futures to a record above $15 a barrel,
surpassing the previous high of $13.06 on Tuesday.
 In London, ICE March Brent  settled $1.90 higher at
$101.82 a barrel.
 U.S. crude for March delivery  ended 23 cents lower
at $86.71 a barrel.
 Gold was little changed as the market was underpinned by
the dollar's drop and Bernanke's comment on bond-buying and the
indication that rates will not rise any time soon.
[ID:nLDE7180U2]
 U.S. gold futures for April delivery  settled up
$1.40 at $1,365.50.

 * Brazil announces budget cut, real adds 0.36 pct
 * Chilean analysts see rate hike later in month
 * Mexico's annual inflation slows, peso loses 0.33 pct
(Updates to afternoon)
 By Jean Luis Arce and Maria Jose Latorre
 MEXICO CITY/SANTIAGO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Brazil and Chile's
currencies firmed on Wednesday, while Mexico's peso sank as the
central bank signaled there is no hurry to tighten borrowing
costs.
 The Chilean  peso firmed 0.59 percent to 476.20 per
dollar, its strongest level since early January, backed by bets
on higher interest rates.
 Economists expect Chile's central bank to hike interest
rates to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent at a meeting later this
month to cool surging inflation.
 ""The market is good and committed to a rate hike in
February,"" said Rodrigo Sarria, a trader with Celfin Capital.
 Besides Chile's strong economy, recent record-high copper
prices have helped support the peso.
 ""With copper at the levels we've seen in the last few
sessions it's hard to think the currency won't keep on
gaining,"" Sarria added.
 The central bank also refrained from increasing the size of
its intervention program of daily dollar purchases on Tuesday,
suggesting it is willing to let the currency gain some ground
to help curb inflation pressures, analysts said.
 Also supporting bids for riskier assets like emerging
market currencies, the U.S. dollar slipped broadly after the
head of the U.S. Federal Reserve said unemployment in the
world's largest economy was too high. His comments suggested
the central bank would push on with its $600 billion stimulus
program. [ID:nN09164124]
 The Fed has taken interest rates down to near zero to try
to stimulate the still-sluggish U.S. economy. But that
ultra-loose policy has also allowed investors to borrow money
cheaply there, only to pour those funds into higher-yielding
emerging markets such as Chile and Brazil
 The resulting strengthening of Latin American currencies
has been a worry for regional governments, hurting industry and
fueling a flood of cheap imports.
 Brazil's real  firmed to its strongest in more than a
month, gaining 0.36 percent to bid at 1.659 per dollar.
 Brazil's benchmark interest rate is at 11.25 percent,
making it one of the highest in the world, and the central bank
is expected to keep raising interest rates.
 The country's government unveiled budget cuts of about $30
billion on Wednesday, the minimum needed to cool an overheating
economy and begin to regain credibility among investors worried
about overspending. [ID:nN09134882]
 The cuts could ease pressure on Brazil's central bank to
raise its benchmark rate as much as some have been expecting.
 In contrast, the Mexican peso  weakened 0.33 percent
to 12.0755 per dollar.
 Mexico's annual inflation rate slowed sharply in January
and the central bank cut its inflation forecast, bolstering
expectations that interest rate rises are not in the cards in
the short term. [ID:nN09159668]
 ""Between the data and the inflation report, it makes you
think they are in no rush to raise interest rates,"" said Luis
Flores, an economist at brokerage IXE in Mexico City.
 He said the news could keep Mexico's peso from definitively
firming past the 12 per dollar level in the coming weeks.
 Mexico's currency broke the 12 level last month for the
first time in nearly 2-1/2 years, but it has struggled to mount
further gains since then.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slumped against
the euro on Wednesday as lower Treasury yields fueled selling
following comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
that its bond buying program would continue.
 The dollar fell to a three-day low against the euro, but
was steady against the Japanese yen as U.S. bond yields dropped
after an auction of $24 billion in 10-year Treasury notes drew
strong demand.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3745  on trading
platform EBS, breaking above resistance around $1.3740, the
61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement, a technical indicator, of
its fall from November to January. It last traded at $1.3722,
up 0.7 percent. The next upside target is around $1.3765, the
euro's low on Feb. 2.
 ""The comments from Bernanke were more dovish than expected
as some thought he would give more credit to recent
improvements seen in the labor market, but he did not,
indicating he is in no rush to raise rates any time soon,"" said
Alan Ruskin, foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank in
New York.
 ""The euro will likely remain range-bound until there is
more clarity on EFSF (the emergency bailout fund), perhaps when
European leaders meet next month,"" Ruskin said. ""Whether or not
the European Central Bank decides to raise rates ahead of the
U.S. Federal Reserve is also a big wild card.""
 Some analysts hoped that given more signs of a U.S.
economic recovery, Bernanke would drop hints that the Fed would
end its $600 billion bond-buying program sooner than expected.
Instead, he repeated concerns about high unemployment, ensuring
the Fed's quantitative easing will remain in place and fuel
dollar selling. For details, see [ID:nN09164124]
 European debt market developments and euro zone monetary
policy trends boosted the euro during January, but the its
outlook is starting to wane, according to Wells Fargo.
 ""We see limited upside for the euro from current levels,
while the currency could be vulnerable in the coming weeks if
U.S. data strengthen more decisively,"" the bank said. ""Overall,
we continue to expect medium-term dollar strength versus the
euro, yen and pound, while we generally expect dollar weakness
against the commodity and emerging currencies.""
 Most G10 currencies have been range-bound this year and
short-dated implied volatility has fallen sharply, with notable
drops, including USD/CAD 3-month volatility, which is at levels
seen before the 2008 financial crisis, according to Deutsche
Bank.
 Foreign exchange volatility is most strongly associated
with the level of the U.S. unemployment rate, the bank said, so
last week's sizable drop in the jobless rate is consistent with
lower volatility. But with long-term macro-economic risks still
abundant, long-dated volatility still looks set to lag rather
than lead short-dates.
 The dollar also hit a session low of 82.20 yen on EBS
immediately following the Treasury debt auction, but soon
turned slightly positive and was last at 82.38 yen ,
up 0.1 percent on the day. Hedge funds were said to be buyers
of the pair overnight, with traders citing stop orders above
82.70 yen.
 A break through 82.95 yen, the initial trendline
resistance, will trigger a bullish signal on dollar/yen and
open upside toward 85 yen, BNP Paribas said in a note.
 Further weighing on the yen was a Moody's warning that a
lack of success on fiscal reform would negatively affect
Japan's credit rating. [ID:nTOE718050]
 In other trading, the dollar fell 0.6 percent against the
Swiss franc  to 0.9574 francs and was also down 0.2
percent against sterling at $1.6102 .
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, measured against six major
currencies, lost 0.5 percent to 77.598 <.DXY>.

 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro on Wednesday, after a strong Treasury debt sale
accelerated bearish sentiment in the wake of comments by
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that its bond buying
program would continue.
 The dollar fell to a 3-day low versus the euro but was
steady against the Japanese yen as U.S. bond yields fell after
an auction of $24 billion 10-year Treasury notes drew strong
demand.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3745  on trading
platform EBS, breaking above resistance around $1.3740, the
61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from November to
January. It last traded at $1.3724, up 0.7 percent. The next
upside target is around $1.3765, the euro's low on Feb. 2.
 Most of G10 currencies have been range-bound this year and
short-dated implied volatility has fallen sharply, with notable
drops including USD/CAD 3-month volatility which is now at
levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis according to
Deutsche Bank.
 Foreign exchange volatility is most strongly associated
with the level of the U.S. unemployment rate, the bank said, so
last week's sizable drop in the jobless rate is consistent with
lower volatility, but with long-term macro-economic risks still
abundant, long-dated volatility still looks set to lag rather
than lead short-dates.
 The euro earlier broke above the $1.3700 level versus the
dollar, triggering stop orders in the wake of Bernanke's
testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee
that largely echoed a speech he delivered last week.
 Bernanke said U.S. unemployment remained too high,
suggesting the Fed would push on with its $600 billion stimulus
program. The Fed's program, first announced last November, is
tantamount to printing money, essentially diluting the value of
the dollar.
 Some analysts hoped that given more signs of a U.S.
economic recovery, Bernanke would drop hints that the Fed would
end its bond-buying program sooner than expected. Instead he
repeated concerns about high unemployment, ensuring the Fed's
quantitative easing will remain in place and fueling dollar
selling. For details, see [ID:nN09164124]
 ""Bernanke is telling you that the Fed is not going to rush
to raise rates, and that's why the dollar sold off,"" said David
Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in New York.
 ""To some extent, he's also pouring cold (water) on the bond
market selloff in the last week or so. So the dollar selloff is
in sync with the rally in Treasuries.""
 The euro had been rising throughout the session, with
traders citing talk of buying by central banks in Russia and
South Korea.
 The dollar also hit a session low of 82.20 yen on EBS
immediately following the Treasury debt auction, but soon
turned slightly positive and was last at 82.37 yen ,
up 0.1 percent on the day.
 Hedge funds were said to be buyers of the currency pair
overnight, with traders citing stop orders above 82.70 yen.
 U.S. Treasury yields have moved higher across the curve in
the past week amid further signs of a U.S. recovery. Two-year
yields have risen about 30 basis points in the last week.
 A break through 82.95 yen, the initial trendline
resistance, will trigger a bullish signal on dollar/yen and
open upside toward 85 yen, BNP Paribas said in a note.
 More gains for the dollar are seen in the near term against
the yen, analysts said, especially since the currency pair has
lagged the increase in Treasury yields. At current two-year
yields, analysts said the dollar should be trading between 88
to 89 yen.
 Further weighing on the yen was a Moody's warning that a
lack of success on fiscal reform would negatively affect
Japan's credit rating. [ID:nTOE718050]
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc 
to 0.9570 francs and was also down 0.2 percent against sterling

 * S.Korea to offset losses due to foot-and-mouth disease
 By Bob Burgdorfer
 CHICAGO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - U.S. beef exports this year
could be the highest in eight years, the head of the U.S. Meat
Export Federation said, as a weak U.S. dollar, improving
economies and a growing hunger for meat continues to drive
sales, particularly in Asia and the Middle East.
 Phil Seng, chief executive of the export promotion group,
also told Reuters in an interview this week that pork exports
in 2011 were forecast to be the highest in three years.
 Strong meat exports will be needed to justify the record
high cattle and hog prices that some analysts expect this year,
according to a Reuters poll last week. [ID:nN04126900]
 (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/sad87r)
 Seng said Asian countries were expected to buy more beef
and pork this year, and the Middle East more beef.
 U.S. beef exports from January to November last year were
up nearly 18 percent from a year earlier and pork was up 2.5
percent and were the key reasons for the high cattle and hog
markets. The final 2010 meat export figures will be released on
Monday.
 For 2011, beef exports should be up about 10 percent and
pork up about 5 percent, said Seng.
 PENT UP DEMAND
 Seng's projected increases would still put exports shy of
the record 2.52 billion lbs of beef exported in 2003 and the
4.65 billion of pork in 2008.
 ""The 10 percent on the beef side could be conservative if
the U.S. gains more access to Japan and China,"" said Seng.
 Japan, the No. 3 export market for U.S. beef, only buys
U.S. beef from cattle under 20 months of age, but Seng is
optimistic that age limit could be relaxed this year because of
domestic and international pressures.
""If we could get some more access there beyond this 20
months, it would be huge. There is tremendous pent up demand in
Japan,"" he said.
 China said in December it will lift its seven-year-old ban
on U.S. beef, but provided few details. China may need to
import beef and pork to tame food price inflation there,
Chinese industry sources said.
 USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters on Wednesday that
talks are under way with China and relate to offal products, or
non-meat items such as organs.
 SOUTH KOREA NEEDS PROTEIN, EGYPT BUYING BEEF
 South Korea should again be an important market for U.S.
beef and pork as it needs the imports to offset lost production
because of foot-and-mouth disease in its livestock herds.
 ""It is desperately in need of protein,"" Seng said.
 About 25 percent of South Korea's hog herd has been culled
as its fight to halt spread of the disease.
 ""I think they are starting to get their arms around it, but
they are not there yet,"" Seng said of disease-fighting
efforts.
 Beef shipments to Egypt have resumed after coming to a halt
about two weeks ago at the outset of the anti-government
demonstrations there.
""It looks like Egypt might getting back to more normal. They
are starting to clear product again. It was at a standstill for
the last 12 days,"" he said.
 Egypt primarily buys beef livers and recently opened its
market to all ages of U.S. beef, said Seng.
 Saudi Arabia continues to be an important buyer of both
beef and beef variety meats, the latter including such things
as livers and internal organs, he said.

 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped and the
dollar fell on Wednesday as investors worried about the run-up
in equity markets this year and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said U.S. unemployment remained too high.
 U.S. crude prices retreated as official data showed
increases in U.S. oil inventories, while prices for Brent crude
in London topped $100 a barrel, supported by unrest in Egypt.

 U.S. government debt prices rose as bargain hunters emerged
as anxiety over the U.S. central bank's inflation-fighting pace
pushed benchmark yields to 9-1/2-month highs. [ID:nN09165656]
 Bernanke told the a U.S. House panel that a 9 percent
unemployment rate was too high and the rate of inflation too
low for the Fed to budge from its super-loose policy stand,
while acknowledging recent economic improvement.
[ID:nWAL9DE7ZM]
 The euro broke above a key $1.3700 level versus the dollar
on Bernanke's testimony before the U.S. House of
Representatives Budget Committee that largely echoed a speech
he delivered last week.
 Wall Street edged lower as investors booked profits after
stocks hit new 2-1/2-year highs Tuesday, but strong earnings
made it likely the market would continue an upward trend.
[ID:nN09170180]
 Global stocks, as measured by MSCI's all-country world
index <.MIWD00000PUS> are up more than 4 percent so far this
year and the S&P 500, a U.S. benchmark, has gained more than 5
percent since the beginning of 2011.
 ""The primary trend (in the market) is that we are moving up
on solid earnings, and a little bit of profit-taking on a small
volume only means new bids are coming up,"" said Joseph Greco,

520,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2011 12:12PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Pirates stalk shipping lanes," Feb 9 (Reuters) - Armed pirates seized the Irene SL, a
U.S.-bound oil tanker, off Oman on Wednesday, carrying around
$200 million worth of crude, in one of the biggest raids in the
area to date, escalating the threat to vital shipping lanes.
 Here are some details about shipping around the region:
* STRAIT OF HORMUZ/ARABIAN SEA/GULF OF OMAN:
 -- A narrow bend of water separating Oman and Iran. It
connects the biggest Gulf oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia,
with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.
 -- At its narrowest point, the strait is only 21 miles
across and consists of 2-mile (3-km) wide navigable channels for
inbound and outbound shipping and a 2-mile-wide buffer zone.
 -- Flows through the Strait in 2009 were roughly 33 percent
of all seaborne traded oil (40 percent in 2008), or 17 percent
of oil traded worldwide, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration (EIA).
 -- Hormuz is the world's most important oil chokepoint due
to its daily oil flow of 17.0 million barrels in 2010. On
average, 13 crude oil tankers per day passed eastbound through
the Strait in 2009.
 
 * GULF OF ADEN:
 -- Up to 30,000 ships pass through the Gulf of Aden each
year, heading to and from the Suez Canal.
 -- Millions of tonnes of crude oil, petroleum products, gas
and dry commodities such as grains, iron ore and coal, as well
as containerised goods from Hi-Fis to toys are ferried through
the Gulf of Aden and Suez Canal every month.
 -- The Strait of Bab el-Mandab is a chokepoint between the
Horn of Africa and the Middle East, and a strategic link between
the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. It is located between
Yemen, Djibouti, and Eritrea, and connects the Red Sea with the
Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea.
 -- Exports from the Gulf and Asia to the West must pass
through Bab el-Mandab before entering the Suez Canal.
 * SUEZ CANAL:
 -- The 192-km (120-mile) Suez Canal is the quickest sea
route between Asia and Europe.
 -- The canal is one of seven geographic choke points
identified by the U.S-based Energy Information Administration
(EIA). These narrow channels are critically important to the
world oil trade and are also susceptible to blockages or pirate
attacks.
 -- About 8 percent of the world seaborne trade passed
through the Suez Canal in 2009.
 -- Crude oil and refined products volume accounted for
around 15 percent of Suez cargoes in 2009, measured by tonnage.
Over 50 percent of total tonnage was accounted for by container
shipping including finished goods from electronics to toys.

imports
 * French opposition seen as main barrier to adoption
 
 (Adds detail, quotes, background)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - A European Union committee
failed to reach a decision on Wednesday on a proposal to allow
minute levels of unapproved genetically modified (GM) material
in animal feed imports to the bloc.
 The proposed 0.1 percent threshold is designed to avoid a
repeat of supply disruptions in 2009, when U.S. soy shipments to
Europe were blocked after unapproved GM material was found in
some cargoes.
 After two days of talks in Brussels, opposition to the plan
from a number of EU states, including France, meant that the
committee could not reach the qualified majority needed under
the bloc's weighted voting rules, a source close to the meeting
said.
 Rather than abandon the proposal, discussion among EU
governments will continue at a future meeting, an EU diplomat on
the committee told Reuters. Another source said the talks could
resume as early as Feb. 22.
 ""The European Commission takes note of the fact that some
member states have requested a prolongation of the discussion on
the issue,"" the EU's executive said in a statement.
 Adoption will now depend on whether France can be convinced
to reverse its opposition to the plan, as other sceptical states
are unlikely to change their position, sources close to the
issue said.
 EU feed and livestock producers have said the 0.1 percent
threshold is needed to safeguard affordable feed supplies for
the import-dependent bloc.
 Last year, the European Union imported more than 51 million
tonnes of animal feed worth almost 15 billion euro, according to
the Commission's latest trade statistics.
 But green groups have accused the Commission of caving in to
GM-industry lobbying by proposing to relax the bloc's
""zero-tolerance"" policy on unauthorised GM crops.
 ""The postponement of the vote indicates what a controversial
issue this is. The case put forward by the animal feed industry
is based on scaremongering and not on reality,"" said Friends of
the Earth food campaigner Mute Schimpf.
 
 FOOD CONCERNS
 If adopted, the 0.1 threshold would only apply to imports of
animal feed and not human food, despite warnings from exporting
states that it is impractical and costly to seperate global
grain supplies into those destined for food and those for feed.
 A majority of EU governments was also reported to be in
favour of a similar threshold for food imports.
 Legislation covering both food and feed imports is also the
preferred option of European food and drink industry association
CIAA, which represents major multinationals including Unilever,
Nestle and Danone.
 ""A partial feed-only 'technical solution' is not based on
the reality of trade in the commodity market and overall food
manufacturing processes,"" CIAA and ten other EU industry
associations said in a recent letter to the Commission.
 ""Making a distinction between use of imported materials for
food and feed presents our industries with a challenging and
unmanageable situation ... Thus we believe that the technical
solution should include food as well as feed,"" the letter added.

 * More dollar/yen gains seen, playing catch-up to yields
(Recasts, updates prices, adds quote, Bernanke comment)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said U.S.
unemployment remained too high, suggesting the Fed would push
on with its $600 billion stimulus program.
 Euro buying by central banks to diversify their reserves
also undermined the dollar.
 The euro broke above a key $1.3700 level versus the dollar,
triggering stops just above that point in the wake of
Bernanke's testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives
Budget Committee that largely echoed a speech he delivered last
week.
 Traders said the euro may encounter resistance at $1.3745,
a daily pivot point, and above there, at $1.3765, the low on
Feb. 2, and $1.3825, the high on the same day.
 For now, analysts said the euro seemed to be on an
ascending path on the technical charts.
 Some analysts hoped that given broadening signs of a U.S.
recovery, Bernanke would drop hints that the Fed would end its
bond-buying program sooner than expected. Instead he repeated
concerns about high unemployment, ensuring the Fed's
quantitative easing will remain in place and fueling dollar
selling.
 In general, the Fed's easing program tends to weaken the
greenback because it boosts the supply of dollars in the
market.
 ""Bernanke is telling you that the Fed is not going to rush
to raise rates, and that's why the dollar sold off,"" said David
Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in New York.
 ""To some extent, he's also pouring cold (water) on the bond
market selloff in the last week or so. So the dollar selloff is
in sync with the rally in Treasuries.""
 In mid-day trading, the euro rose 0.4 percent versus the
dollar to $1.3684, after hitting session highs at $1.3721 on
electronic trading platform EBS.
 The euro has been rising all morning, with traders citing
talk of buying by central banks in Russia and South Korea.
 Near-term support was at $1.3538, the 100-day moving
average, followed by $1.3480, the 23.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the January-to-February euro rally.
 The dollar, meanwhile, held gains against the yen,
supported by the rising trend in U.S. yields.
 U.S. Treasury yields have moved higher across the curve in
the past week amid signs of a broadening U.S. recovery and
positive comments from Fed officials. Two-year yields have
risen about 30 basis points in the last week.
 Higher yields tend to support the dollar against the yen.
 The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 82.43 yen, recovering from
a fall to 81.77 yen on Tuesday. Hedge funds were said to be
buyers of the currency pair overnight, with traders citing
stops above 82.70 yen.
 A break through 82.95 yen, the initial trendline
resistance, will trigger a bullish signal on dollar/yen and
open upside toward 85 yen, BNP Paribas said in a note.
 More gains for the dollar are seen in the near term against
the yen, analysts said, especially since the currency pair has
lagged the increase in Treasury yields. At current two-year
yields, analysts said the dollar should be trading between 88
to 89 yen.
 Further weighing on the yen was a Moody's warning that a
lack of success on fiscal reform would negatively affect
Japan's credit rating.
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc to
0.9608 francs and was also down 0.2 percent against sterling
at $1.6108.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, measured against six major
currencies, lost 0.4 percent to 77.730.

 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped and bond
yields rose on Wednesday as investors, seeking direction,
weighed the year's quick run-up in equity prices against the
safety of government debt, now offering a 3.7 percent return.
 U.S. oil prices pared gains and gold held close to the
previous session's near-three-week high, supported by an
increased focus on inflation after China's second interest rate
hike in six weeks and interest in the metal as a haven. For
details see: [ID:nLDE7180U2]
 Other asset prices also traded near flat, as investors
weighed a surge in equity prices that have lifted global stocks
more than 4 percent so far this year and the S&P 500, a U.S.
benchmark, more than 5 percent since the beginning of 2011.
 The dollar gained slightly against the yen, supported by
the rise in Treasury yields and the suggestion of an improving
economic outlook. But it came under pressure in Europe as
central banks sold greenbacks to buy euros and diversify.
[ID:nN09331341]
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.18 percent at 77.858.
 The euro  was up 0.48 percent at $1.3698, and against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.24 percent at
82.52.
 Government debt was higher but pared gains after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that U.S.
unemployment remains too high despite increasing signs of
economic strength. [ID:nN09164124]
 At one point bond prices turned negative, as Bernanke's
testimony suggested the U.S. central bank would push on with
its $600 billion stimulus program.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
5/32 in price to yield 3.7172 percent.
 Ten-year Treasury note yields earlier hit nine-month highs
before a $24 billion auction of notes later on Wednesday.
Higher yields make bonds a more attractive investment and can
crimp the appeal of equities as they translate into costlier
funding for corporations.
 ""Earnings are fine, the economy continues to show signs of
life but we do have this interest rate headwind (and) Treasury
yields moving higher that the U.S. equity market can't continue

 (Adds closing prices, eurobond expectation, Karsan)
 ISTANBUL, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Turkish bonds extended a
week-long fall on Wednesday, hit by worries over inflation and
further central bank policy tightening ahead of next week's
monetary policy committee meeting.
 The yield on the benchmark Nov. 7, 2012 bond rose to 8.62
percent from 8.47 percent on Tuesday, extending rises from 8.39
percent at the end of last week. In Thursday-dated trade it
slipped back to 8.53 percent.
 The lira weakened to 1.5860 against the dollar in interbank
trade, from a previous close of 1.5760.
 Istanbul's main share index closed up 0.48 percent at
65,569.61, adding to gains of 0.54 percent a day earlier.
Turkish shares have weakened since the start of 2011 after
rallying 27 percent last year.
 As the fourth-quarter earnings season begins, solid profits
from industrial companies could drive up the share index, but
banks are taking a hit from increases to required reserve ratios
by the central bank.
 Loans surged 34 percent last year but the bank would like to
limit credit growth this year to 20-25 percent.
 The central bank cut interest rates in December and January
in a surprise change in policy but at the same time raised
banks' required reserve ratios in order to ensure an overall
tightening effect.
 Its next policy meeting on Feb. 15 sees analysts split over
whether it will cut interest rates again. Governor Durmus Yilmaz
has reaffirmed the policy was for gradual tightening and
declined to rule out further rises in reserve requirements.
 Uncertainty about the bank's next move and complaints over
its policy visibility have made bond markets broadly jittery.
 Separately, senior Turkish treasury officials will meet
investors at a roadshow in London next week and fund managers
said on Wednesday the country could be gearing up to issue its
second international bond of the year.
 Turk Telekom shares rose 2.7 percent to 6.94 lira after the
firm posted a 31.8 percent rise in net profit to 2.451 billion
lira ($1.56 billion) in 2010.
 Sales rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier to 10.85 billion
lira. The telecoms group did not provide fourth-quarter figures,
but based on previously released data, net profit in the fourth
quarter stood at 559 million lira, exceeding a Reuters poll
forecast of 535 million lira.
 ""Turk Telekom reported strong fourth-quarter and full year
2010 results that significantly exceeded our above consensus
estimates,"" JP Morgan wrote in a note.
 Shares in automaker Karsan rose 2.1 percent to 1.98 lira on
speculation that it could win a contract to produce New York
taxis. It is one of three finalists in the tender.

 By Pedro da Costa and Mark Felsenthal
 WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke on Wednesday warned against sharp cuts in U.S.
spending at a time when the economic recovery is still fragile
enough to require extraordinary support from the central bank.
 Even as he warned about the need for a long-term plan to
address ""unsustainable"" budget deficits, Bernanke said steep
reductions in government outlays could compromise growth at a
time when employment is just beginning to rebound.
 ""The cost to the recovery would outweigh the benefits in
terms of fiscal discipline,"" Bernanke told the House of
Representatives' Budget Committee. ""I think we really need to
take a long-term view.""
 Bernanke offered few clues into whether the Fed might
extend its controversial policy of buying $600 billion in
government bonds beyond its June deadline, but nor did he
signal any inclination to cut the program short.
 The Fed launched the bond-buying plan in November in an
attempt to keep long-term borrowing costs down and support a
fragile economic rebound.
 Acknowledging renewed momentum in the economy, Bernanke
said a drop in the jobless rate to 9 percent in January from
9.8 percent in November, the biggest two-month decline since
1958, was ""grounds for optimism.""
 However, he said hiring is still anemic and noted that the
economy has made up just over one million of the more than
eight million jobs lost during the recession.
 ""This gain was ... not enough to significantly erode the
wide margin of slack that remains in our labor market,"" he
said. ""Until we see a sustained period of stronger job
creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly
established.

 DEFENDING THE PROGRAM
 The Fed's aggressive bond-buying program drew ire from many
policymakers in emerging markets, who accused the United States
of unfairly driving down the value of the U.S. dollar to boost
exports.
 At home, many Republicans attacked the policy as
potentially inflationary, concerns on display again Wednesday
as Bernanke made his first appearance before a House committee
since Republicans assumed control of the chamber last month.
 The discourse was generally civil, although some of the
questions were pointed.
 The panel's chairman, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of
Wisconsin, opened the hearing by criticizing the Fed for
providing the fuel for future bubbles and inflation, suggesting
the bond purchases were eroding the dollar's value.
 ""There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to
its citizens than debase its currency,"" Ryan said.
 Pressed by skeptical lawmakers, Bernanke said the Fed
regularly reviews its bond buying, but also indicated he feels
it is still needed. He repeated that it would take four to five
years for unemployment to return to more ""normal"" levels closer
to 5 percent.
 ""The chairman continues to deliver the same message of
caution and patience despite the better-than-expected data flow
observed in recent months,"" said Michael Gapen, economist at
Barclays Capital in New York.
 Bernanke said U.S. inflation remains quite low, a tough
message to deliver amid headlines of rising food and commodity
costs across the globe. He also said expectations of future
inflation had remained ""stable,"" suggesting little worry that
an inflationary psychology was building.
 BERNANKE PING-PONG
 Both Democrats and Republicans tried to get Bernanke to
back their views on how best to attack a budget deficit that is
expected to hit a record $1.5 trillion this year. Republicans
want to rein in outlays and ward off any tax increases;
Democrats are wary of cutting spending too deeply now.
 Bernanke offered a fig leaf to both sides, supporting lower
taxes on the one hand while maintaining that short-term budget
reductions should not be too radical.
 ""It's really a question of convincing the market that
there's a long-term plan here,"" Bernanke said, adding that
budget cuts should be done in a ""growth-friendly"" way.
 He said Congress should consider closing corporate tax
loopholes to broaden the tax base so that the corporate tax
rate could be reduced. He also repeated a warning about the
dire consequences of not lifting the country's debt ceiling.
 Asked about the future of government-sponsored enterprises
like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Bernanke said government
backing for the mortgage sector should be a last resort, not
common practice. For more, see: [ID:nN09172003]

dateline from previous LONDON)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen
on Wednesday, lifted by the recent rise in Treasury yields on
hopes of an improving U.S. and global outlook.
 U.S. Treasury yields have moved higher across the curve in
the past week amid signs of a broadening U.S. recovery and
positive comments on the economy from Federal Reserve
officials. The move tends to support the dollar against the
yen.
 Two-year yields have risen about 30 basis points over the
last week.
 More gains for the dollar are seen in the near term,
especially against the yen, analysts said, especially since the
dollar/yen has lagged the increase in Treasury yields. At
current two-year yields, analysts see the dollar trading
between 88-89 yen.
 ""There has been a significant divergence between the
U.S.-Japanese two-year bond spread and dollar/yen ongoing for
several weeks,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist
at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""Today dollar/yen has finally started to shift higher. This
move is not yet complete, and (we) are biased to be long
dollar/yen in the near term.""
 In early New York trading, the dollar gained 0.2 percent to
82.47 yen, recovering from a fall to 81.77 yen on Tuesday.
Hedge funds were said to be buyers of the currency pair
overnight, with traders citing stops above 82.70 yen.
 A break through 82.95 yen, the initial trendline
resistance, will trigger a bullish signal on dollar/yen and
open upside potential toward 85.00 yen, BNP Paribas said in a
research note.
 Further weighing on the yen was a statement from Moody's on
Wednesday, warning that a lack of success on fiscal reform
would have a negative impact on Japan's credit rating.
 The euro rose against the dollar in volatile trading,
boosted by central bank buying to diversify their reserves. It
last traded at $1.3662, up 0.2 percent on the day.
 Near-term support lies at $1.3538, the 100-day moving
average, followed by $1.3480, the 23.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the January-to-February euro rally. Some traders
saw resistance at $1.3811, the opening price on Feb. 3.
 Earlier, the euro fell after sources told Reuters
Bundesbank head Axel Weber would not be a candidate to replace
Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank.
 Weber, who had been considered a front-runner to succeed
Trichet when his term expires in October, is regarded as a hawk
on inflation, but often finds himself in the minority.
 ""He had a fairly hawkish line, and these views may not have
reflected the ECB's, and have not helped him,"" said Steve
Barrow, head of G10 currency research at Standard Bank.
 ""This news has come as a surprise to many, which is why the
euro dipped. But it has held reasonably well, which suggests
there is underlying support.""
 Investors awaited testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke, due at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT), before
the U.S. House Budget Committee. This is the first time
Bernanke will be facing a Republican majority generally viewed
as more hostile to the Fed.
 ""Aside from an expected warning from Bernanke regarding the
extension of U.S. debt limits, the market will also look for
any change of tone in Bernanke's assessment of the U.S.
economy,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at
GFT in New York.

 By Andreas Framke and Matthias Sobolewski
 FRANKFURT/BERLIN, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Bundesbank chief Axel
Weber will not be a candidate to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as
president of the European Central Bank when the Frenchman's term
expires in October, European sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
 A hardline inflation-fighter who has led Germany's central
bank for nearly seven years, Weber had been seen as the leading
contender to replace Trichet, the second president of the ECB
after Dutchman Wim Duisenberg.
 But Weber's staunch public opposition last year to the
Frankfurt-based central bank's decision to buy the bonds of weak
euro zone members to prevent a deepening of the bloc's debt
crisis annoyed countries like France and may have doomed his
chances for Europe's top monetary policy job.
 One German source told Reuters that Weber had decided to
rule himself out for the ECB post after he was informed by the
German government that his candidacy did not have the necessary
support elsewhere in Europe.
 ""Weber's ECB candidacy is no longer on the agenda,"" one
European source said.
 The report of his withdrawal from the unofficial race
surprised markets, pushing the euro down and German bond futures
higher. But the moves were limited and short-lived, suggesting
investors believe a monetary ""hawk"" is likely to replace
Trichet, even if it isn't the 53-year old Weber.
 Sources had told Reuters earlier in the day that the
Bundesbank planned to issue a statement about Weber's
professional future later on Wednesday, but the German central
bank denied that.
 Bundesbank sources said Weber had indicated internally that
he was not interested in a second term at the Bundesbank. His
first term expires in April 2012.
 Sources later said Weber was working on a personal statement
on his future.
 German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Chancellor
Angela Merkel had spoken with Weber on Wednesday morning, but
declined to elaborate on the ""confidential"" conversation.
 He reiterated Berlin wanted a ""strong candidate"" to replace
Trichet and that this person could be German.
 ""The question of who succeeds Mr Trichet is not on the
agenda now, as his term doesn't end until late autumn. Anyway
this is a matter to be decided on internationally and the German
government will have an opinion when it is time,"" said Seibert.
 A senior banking source said there was no agreement for
Weber to take a post at Deutsche Bank after rumours surfaced
that he could move to Germany's largest commercial bank.
 
 GRAND BARGAIN
 Leaders from the 17-nation euro zone are expected to approve
a successor to Trichet by the summer following an agreement
between Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 The bloc's leaders are currently embroiled in negotations on
a comprehensive new package of measures to address the region's
sovereign debt crisis, with Berlin pushing other member states
to commit to German-style fiscal discipline in exchange for
agreeing to increase the bloc's bailout fund.
 Berlin has repeatedly denied that the decision on the ECB
presidency post would be part of a ""grand bargain"" that also
included the policy package, which is expected to be finalised
at a March 24-25 European Union summit.
 But deals on top posts have often been sealed in the EU as
part of broader agreements on other contentious issues.
 ""It could be that Weber didn't want to be part of that
bargain,"" said Katinka Barysch, deputy director of the Centre
for European Reform in London.
 Weber's opposition to the ECB's bond-buying programme
reinforced the view in some European capitals that his strict
adherence to monetary orthodoxy might be a problem as the euro
zone struggles to emerge from the deepest crisis in its 12-year
existence.
 France and southern European countries may have pushed hard
behind the scenes for a candidate who would be more willing to
use extraordinary measures, even if they were in conflict with
the strict inflation-fighting mandate the ECB received when it
was created in 1998.
 ""I think it's been clear for some time that Weber was too
abrasive a character for the role of ECB President,"" said James
Nixon, an economist at Societe Generale.
 
 OTHER CANDIDATES
 Weber's withdrawal does not necessarily mean a German will
miss out on the post.
 Klaus Regling, head of the European Financial Stability
Facility, the euro zone's bailout fund, is viewed as a second
German option although he said in November he was not
interested.
 Weber's chief rival for the post has long been seen to be
Italian central bank head Mario Draghi, who as chairman of the
Financial Stability Board has been in charge of coordinating
global financial regulation since the 2008-09 crisis.
 Other names that have been mentioned include Bank of Finland
Governor Erkki Liikanen, a former European Commissioner and a
monetary policy moderate; Ewald Nowotny, Austria's central bank
chief; and Yves Mersch from Luxembourg, who is the longest
serving member of the ECB's governing council.
 Marco Valli, chief euro zone economist at Unicredit, said
that with Weber out of the way, a candidate from a small country
like Mersch or Liikanen appeared most likely.
 ""Draghi's main problem is his nationality,"" he said. ""With
the debt crisis still far from being solved, it's not easy to
see the ECB steering so clearly towards the periphery.""
 A German source said that Merkel's economic adviser Jens
Weidmann was seen as the leading candidate to replace Weber at
the Bundesbank when he leaves, although ECB member Juergen Stark
has also been mentioned as a possibility.

 * Less than a quarter of small UK companies are exporters
 
 (Updates after publication)
 By Tim Castle
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday it would
seek to boost growth in its faltering economy by helping more of
its small companies to find business overseas.
 The government will offer smaller companies improved trade
finance and insurance products, lobby in Europe for lighter
regulations for small firms and launch an online service
offering sales leads around the world.
 ""Trade and inward investment are key drivers of growth. They
are fundamental to rebuilding and rebalancing our economy.
Encouraging small businesses to export more is at the heart of
that,"" said Business Secretary Vince Cable as he published the
coalition's trade and investment policy.
 The government's export-credit agency would offer small
companies trade financing for the first time since the early
1990s, said trade minister Stephen Green. 
 This would reduce a competitive gap with rivals in Europe
already receiving such support from their governments.
 Britain would also continue to push for the finalisation of
the long-stalled Doha world trade talks and for the removal of
remaining barriers to trade and investment inside Europe's
single market.
 The coalition government says boosting international trade
is key to its plans for expanding growth in the economy, which
emerged from a deep recession in late 2009 and now faces four
years of cuts in state spending to cure a record budget deficit.
 Official data published shortly before the publication of
the trade ""white paper"" highlighted the scale of the challenge
facing the government. 
 The Office for National Statistics said Britain's total
trade deficit sank in December to its worst level since August
2005, deteriorating to 4.83 billion pounds from 3.95 billion
pounds in November, the Office for National Statistics said.
 The trade white paper comes ahead of a broader review of
growth policies the government will publish next month.
 The coalition's economic policies have come under close
scrutiny after data showing the economy shrank at the end of
last year and following U.S. drug group Pfizer's planned closure
of a research laboratory in England.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Expectations are firming that the
European Central Bank will raise rates in the fourth quarter as
the economic recovery takes hold and it focuses on controlling
inflation, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
 The poll of around 60 economists, taken over the past week,
saw them revising up their median forecasts for growth as a long
bout of ultra-loose monetary policy bears fruit.
 The 17-nation bloc's economy is expected to grow 1.6 percent
this year and 1.8 percent in 2012, up from the respective 1.5
and 1.7 percent predictions in a poll taken just a month ago.
 ""The business cycle recovery in the region is proceeding at
a stronger pace than we anticipated, especially in Germany ...
This, combined with higher inflation, is resulting in a more
hawkish central bank,"" said Jacques Cailloux at RBS.
 Unemployment -- which held steady at 10.0 percent in
December -- is likely to have peaked, according to 27 of the 33
economists who answered.
 But the recovery, led by Germany, is coming at a price --
inflation is rising sharply and that presents a dilemma for the
ECB which is tasked with maintaining price stability but wants
to support struggling economies like those of Spain and Ireland.
 The ECB's goal is to keep inflation just below 2 percent but
economists do not see it coming back to that level until early
next year as soaring commodities, fuel and food costs couple
with a depreciating euro to drive prices higher.
 Euro zone inflation accelerated to a 15-month high of 2.4
percent last month and medians from the poll predict prices will
rise 2.1 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2012, up from
respective 1.9 and 1.8 percent predicted in last month's poll.
 This is the first poll where 2011 inflation is seen above
2.0 percent since Reuters began forecasts in January 2010.
 Highlighting market uncertainty, consensus timing for the
first rate move had flip-flopped over the previous three polls
of economists between the fourth quarter and the first three
months of 2012, but is now settling on the fourth quarter.
 Forty-two of 78 economists now expect a rate hike from the
central bank before the end of this year, compared to 41 of 81
in a poll taken two weeks ago.
 Medians show interest rates rising to 1.25 percent in the
fourth quarter and then by 25 basis points per quarter until the
end of September 2012, ending next year at 2.0 percent.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said after the bank's
February rate setting meeting that inflation was likely to climb
further and exceed target for most of the year but posed no
threat to medium-term price stability.
 ""The bank is now concerned that inflation is currently above
their 2 percent target. This largely reflects high food and
energy prices, a by-product of the global upturn, and so euro
rates are unlikely to rise any time soon, although the market is
now pricing in a quarter point increase in the final months of
the year,"" said Dan McLaughlin at Bank of Ireland.
 China raised interest rates on Tuesday, its second increase
in just over six weeks, intensifying its own campaign against
stubbornly high inflation in the world's second largest economy.
 And the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of
England are seen making their first rate moves at the end of
2010 as they battle to stem price rises.

 * Inflation forecasts revised up
 * Central banks seen tightening this year
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Rich world economies could grow
faster this year than previously thought, albeit with higher
inflation and a growing likelihood that major central banks will
start to hike interest rates, Reuters polls showed.
 The United States is still seen leading in terms of growth
but economists have revised up their more lacklustre forecasts
for the euro zone and Japan. Only forecasts for the British
economy became gloomier.
 ""While events in North Africa have captured market attention
the global economic backdrop is improving. Growth indicators
continue to surprise to the upside,"" said Ethan Harris at
BofAML.
 Markets have been watching closely for further fallout from
political unrest in Egypt and Tunisia, which could potentially
push oil prices still higher after they hit a 28-month peak last
week.
 The improving growth outlook, coupled with prices being
driven up by rising food, energy and commodity costs, have led
central banks to start unwinding their loose monetary policies
or at least begin taking a more hawkish stance.
 ""Key interest rate hikes are fast approaching. Output gaps
are on their way towards closing. Financial conditions continue
to normalise, including the beginnings of growth in the money
supply,"" SEB economists said in a research note.
 ""This indicates that central banks in the major OECD
countries must soon start normalising their monetary policies to
keep inflation expectations under control.""
 China raised interest rates on Tuesday, its second increase
in just over six weeks, intensifying its own campaign against
stubbornly high inflation in the world's second largest economy.
 The United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank
and the Bank of England are all seen making their first moves at
the end of this year as they battle to stem rising prices.
 Only the Bank of Japan, still fighting deflation, is seen
holding rates until at least next October.
 
 HIGHER GROWTH
 Growth forecasts for the 17-nation euro zone for 2011 were
revised up to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent but British forecasts
were nudged down to 1.7 percent as economists expected fiscal
austerity to have a greater impact than previously thought.
 In contrast U.S. economic growth was seen averaging 3.2
percent this year, up from the 3.0 percent predicted last month,
led by reviving consumer demand and an improving job market.
 ""Recent upward trends in income growth and retail sales, and
a relative improvement in labour market conditions and consumer
optimism, will push personal spending up,"" said Nathaniel Karp
at BBVA.
 But even U.S. growth pales into comparison when compared to
predicted Chinese growth of 9.3 percent and Indian expansion
forecast at 8.7 percent in the year to end-March 2012. Both
should benefit export-driven economies.
 ""Strong domestic demand growth in emerging Asia should spill
over into strong commodity demand and boost export-oriented
economies with high emerging market exposure,"" said Willem
Buiter at Citi.
 The voracious demand means Japan's export-led economy will
emerge from a lull early this year, growing 1.5 percent in the
coming financial year, according to the poll.
 ""Exports and output are expected to recover at a faster pace
in the first quarter and pull the economy out of a lull,"" said
Takumi Tsunoda, a senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank
Research Institute.

 * Grain 7-mo exports at 7.3 mln T vs 15.8 mln year ago -firm
 
(Adds export data in paragraphs 13 and 14)
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine's Farm Ministry said on
Wednesday it would review the country's grain stocks to decide
whether the ex-Soviet republic needs to restrict grain exports
for the remainder of the current season.
 ""We will re-examine grain stocks of our producers and will
make a decision,"" Farm Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk told
reporters.
 Ukraine, the world's top barley exporter and a major wheat
supplier, introduced export quotas after a drought last summer
to prevent a rise in domestic bread prices after neighbouring
Russia banned grain exports for the whole 2010/11 season.
 In October, the government introduced a 2.7 million tonne
grain export quota, and in December it extended the quotas until
March 31 and increased the total volume to 4.2 million tonnes.
 Last month Prysyazhnyuk told Reuters that the ministry would
urge the government to allow unlimited exports of grain in the
forthcoming 2011-2012 marketing season and in the last three
months of the current season.
 Last week Ukraine's Economy Ministry said it had proposed
that the government should cancel restrictions on maize exports
in the 2010/11 season.
 But Prysyazhnyuk said the government had taken into account
negative harvest news from abroad.
""We had expected good harvests in Brazil and Argentina. But
now we see that the forecasts of their grain yields are reduced.
We see a serious shortage of grain,"" Prysyazhnyuk said.
 
 PRICE PRESSURES
 Drought in Russia, which banned grain exports in the 2010/11
season, pushed global grain prices to record high levels, and
the recent news of a possible fall in the grain harvest in China
became an additional factor for the jump in prices.
 U.S. wheat futures rose half a percent on Wednesday,
building on the previous session's 2 percent rally to reach near
a 30-month high on growing concern over production in China and
the United States and strong demand.
 Wheat output in China, the world's largest producer and
consumer of the grain, may be at risk after severe winter
drought in its main northern producing regions, the United
Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation said.
 Ukraine, which harvested 16.8 million tonnes of wheat in
2010, has exported about 2.7 million tonnes so far this season,
down from 6.9 million tonnes in the same period in 2009/10 due
to quotas.
 Ukraine's grain exports fell to 7.3 million tonnes in the
first seven months of the 2010/11 season from 15.8 million in
the same period a season earlier, according to data provided by
UkrAgroConsult agriculture consultancy.
 The consultancy said Ukraine had reduced exports of barley
to 2.38 million tonnes from 4.18 million. Exports of maize fell
to 1.92 million tonnes from 3.59 million.
 Ukrainian wheat is traditionally cheaper that the grain
harvested in the European Union and could compete on the key
markets in the Middle East or north Africa.
Traders said on Wednesday that the lowest offer in a
Lebanese government tender to buy 22,500 tonnes of milling
wheat, which closed on Tuesday, was $414.67 a tonne C&F and the
offer was for Ukrainian origin.
 Ukrainian soft milling wheat is traded at about $340 FOB
Black Sea.

 By Martin Dokoupil
 DUBAI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Political turmoil in Egypt may
more than halve the Arab country's economic growth this year,
push its budget deficit into double digits and weaken its
currency, boosting already high inflation.
 A month before massive anti-Hosni Mubarak protests erupted
on Jan. 25, analysts polled by Reuters had expected Egypt's
economy to grow 5.4 percent in the fiscal year ending in June,
second only to Qatar. The government had forecast 6 percent
expansion.
 Banks are reopening but with shops still closed and tourists
shunning the popular holiday hub, those growth predictions now
look optimistic.
 Some analysts have already trimmed their growth projections
as the disruption strips at least $310 million per day from the
crude-importing economy, said Banque Saudi Fransi.
 ""Tourist arrivals were 20 to 30 percent lower year-on-year
after the (1997) Luxor attacks or when the global economy fell
into recession,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said.
 ""Should political uncertainty not abate meaningfully and
remain in place for an extended period, similar contraction
would shave off some 2 to 3 percentage points from headline
growth, which, along with contracting investments, would bring
annual GDP growth to the 1 to 2 percent year-on-year range.""
 Lower private consumption, which accounts for around 70
percent of GDP, a drop in foreign investments and higher
unemployment are also expected to hurt economic performance.
 Egypt's economy was worth an estimated $217 billion last
year, half of oil giant Saudi Arabia, and relies on foreign
investments, tourism and Suez Canal fees, but faces challenges
such as poverty, high unemployment of at least 10 percent -- but
many suggest the real figure is much higher -- and stubborn
inflation.
 Some analysts warn that the central bank could raise
borrowing costs, with the overnight lending rate now at 9.75
percent, to stem capital outflows. Citi estimates outflows of
$500 million to $1 billion per day.
 ""Tourism revenues are taking a big hit and are unlikely to
recover quickly,"" Reinhard Cluse, economist at UBS in London,
said. ""Retail and foreign trade seem to be disrupted and cash
reserves might still be running low.""
 Income from tourism -- estimated at 5 to 11 percent of
economic output -- is an important lifeline for the Arab world's
most populous country, where about 40 percent of people live on
less than $2 per day.
 As protests intensified in the past two weeks, ratings
agencies downgraded Egypt's sovereign ratings by one notch
citing possible damage to already weak state finances.
 
 BUDGET GAP UP
 Facing public anger and a presidential election in
September, the government is likely to keep spending high. Lower
taxes, higher subsidies and pressures to give more money to
unemployed are poised to undermine the fiscal health.
 ""We have already seen a 15 percent rise in salaries and we
will probably see more government expenditure and more emphasis
on wealth distribution within Egypt (taking) from the more
privileged in the society and giving to the poor,"" said Farouk
Soussa, Middle East chief economist for Citi in Dubai.
As a result, the government budget gap is likely to balloon
towards 10 percent of GDP this year, BNP Paribas estimates,
above the government's 2010/11 guidance of 7.9 percent.
 Moreover, inflation that is running at around an annual 10
percent is seen creeping higher on the back of loose fiscal
policy and the weak pound currency.
 ""Our analysis shows that a 1 percent depreciation in the
Egyptian pound versus a 50:50 euro/dollar basket adds
approximately 0.3-0.4 percentage points to headline inflation,""
said Dina Ahmad, CEEMEA strategist at BNP Paribas in London.
 ""Pass-through is therefore quite substantial and would need
to be addressed by the central bank either defending the
currency or hiking rates,"" she said.
 
 RATE HIKE POSSIBLE
 The pound retreated 2.4 percent against the dollar since the
beginning of the protests, that claimed some 300 lives so far.
It erased part of its losses on Tuesday, following the central
bank's intervention, and was quoted at 5.8800 to the dollar as
of 1100 GMT on Wednesday.
 Analysts said some $36 billion in central bank reserves at
the end of December gave it enough fire power to face imminent
capital outflows, but that longer term political instability and
the risk of a run on local banks could push the pound much
lower, paving the way for capital controls.
 It also had an estimated $7 billion to $21 billion of
additional assets with commercial banks, its so-called
unofficial reserves.
 ""Over the short term, we expect the Egyptian pound to fall
by 20 percent,"" said John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque
Saudi Fransi.
 Non-deliverable currency forwards implied on Wednesday that
the pound would soften to 6.600/900 to the dollar over the next
12 months.
 To stave off inflation, the central bank could also opt to
hike interest rates aggressively ahead of its planned policy
meeting on March 10 to counter capital flight.
 ""We believe the central bank will hike rates by 100 basis
points in an emergency meeting this month as inflation is likely
to surge on the back of a weaker pound,"" Ahmad said.

 By Isabel Coles
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - U.S. and UK benchmark bond yields
hit multi-month highs and the dollar rose against the yen and
Swiss franc on Wednesday as investor focus turned to inflation,
while world stocks pulled back from a 29-month high.
 The euro briefly fell against the dollar after sources said
Bundesbank chief Axel Weber will not be a candidate to replace
Jean-Claude Trichet as European Central Bank president.
 U.S. Treasury yields climbed as high as 3.77 percent --
their highest since late April -- while the yield on 10-year
British government bonds hit its highest since May 2010.
 China's interest rate rise on Tuesday, its second in just
over six weeks, has prompted investors to consolidate their
positions after a 4 percent rally in the benchmark world equity
index since the start of the year.
 But investors remained confident China's proactive but
gradual stance in its inflation battle will not derail the
global recovery and improving economic conditions in developed
economies would lead to higher interest rates at some point.
 ""The main reason rates are not being hiked and quantitative
easing continues is because of the miserable state of the U.S.
jobs market,"" RIA Capital rate strategist Harald Eggerstendt
said.
 ""If that improves over time, then policies will change and
rates will go up and so the (debt) market sold off.""
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 82.58 yen while it hit a
2-1/2 week high of 0.9660 Swiss francs. The euro stood at
$1.3643, slightly higher on the day.
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.3 percent, having hit a
29-month peak on Tuesday, while the Thomson Reuters global stock
index was down a quarter percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.1 percent.
 Wall Street looked set to open lower, with U.S. stock
futures down 0.3 percent. Emerging stocks shed around 1.2
percent, while Shanghai shares dropped 0.9 percent.
 Bund futures were down 25 ticks on the day.
 
 RISING YIELDS
 The yield on 10-year British government bonds rose as high
as 3.915 percent, its highest since May 2010.
 Higher energy and commodity prices are putting upward
pressure on inflation and yields, especially in the United
States and Britain.
 The Bank of England's monetary policy decision comes on
Thursday. Money markets are pricing in a small risk of a rate
rise this week and pricing in a full quarter-point hike by May.
 U.S. crude oil rose 0.5 percent to $87.38 a barrel while
London crude prices jumped above $100 due to tighter North Sea
supplies.
 Investors are focusing on an address by Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke later on Wednesday, when he may give clues
on the outlook for U.S. interest rates. Bernanke said last week
the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help -- a stance many
traders expect him to repeat.

not be a candidate to replace European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet, whose eight-year term expires at the end of
October 2011, sources said on Wednesday.
 Weber said on Thursday he would not comment on his future
until he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding a
layer of uncertainty to the situation.
 European Union leaders must select a new ECB president ""from
among persons of recognized standing and professional experience
in monetary and banking matters"". They are expected to do so
around the middle of year.
 Following is a list of possible candidates for the job.
 
 FRONTRUNNERS:
 MARIO DRAGHI, Italy, 63 - A former treasury official with
the IMF and with private sector experience, the Italian central
bank head is chairman of the Financial Stability Board, in
charge of coordinating global financial regulation since the
2008-9 financial crisis. He would be the first Italian in the
position.
 Draghi rarely speaks on interest rate policy but is regarded
as a centrist on the ECB's governing council. His chances may be
reduced by the fact that another southern European considered a
monetary dove, Vitor Constancio of Portugal, was appointed ECB
vice-president last year. Draghi may also be tainted in some
eyes by having worked in 2002-5 for investment bank Goldman
Sachs, criticised for its role in the financial crisis.
 
 KLAUS REGLING, Germany, 60 - Head of the European Financial
Stability Facility, the former senior European Commission
official could emerge as an alternative German candidate.
 Regling holds orthodox German views on monetary policy and
fiscal discipline. He has no central banking experience but
served at the IMF and in the German Finance Ministry before
rising to be director-general for Economic and Financial Affairs
in the EU executive in Brussels.
 
 OTHER GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS:
 JUERGEN STARK, 62 - A former finance ministry official and
Bundesbank Vice-President and a current ECB Executive Board
member. Like Weber, Stark is regarded as one of the most
'hawkish' ECB members who takes a strict line on inflation.
 The chance of him taking over from Trichet appear remote at
first glance. ECB rules prevent anyone seeking back-to-back
terms on the bank's board, but switching from a regular board
seat to president remains a grey area that would be open to a
legal challenge.
 It remains more likely that Stark would move to head the
Bundesbank once Weber steps down.
 
 YVES MERSCH, Luxembourg, 61 - The longest-serving member of
the ECB's governing council, Mersch has headed tiny Luxembourg's
central bank since its creation in 1998. Seen as an inflation
hawk close to German thinking, he might be a compromise
candidate if Weber fails. Luxembourg already has one big EU job,
though, with Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker chairing the
Eurogroup of finance ministers of the euro zone, which could
work against Mersch's chances.
 
 GUY QUADEN, Belgium, 65 - The Belgian National Bank chief is
a respected moderate on the ECB governing council. Similarly to
Mersch, Quaden's chances may be hurt by the fact that Belgium
already has one top European Union job with Hermann Van Rompuy
as president of the European Council. Quaden may also be seen as
too old to start an eight-year stint at 66.
 
 ERKKI LIIKANEN, Finland, 60 - The Finnish central bank chief
is a former European Commissioner and a monetary policy
moderate. His social democratic affiliation and the fact that
Finland already has a key position with European Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn may count against him.
 
 OUTSIDE THE ECB:
 DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN
 The International Monetary Fund head has experience in
spades, even though he has never been at a central bank helm.
The 61-year-old former French finance minister could be put
forward by President Nicolas Sarkozy, but his chances are small
due to his nationality -- Trichet being his compatriot, it is
unlikely other countries would agree to having the French lead
the central bank for 16 years in a row.

 * Global food prices at record high

 * Australia sugar group assesses cycline damage
 * U.S. to issue report Wednesday on global grains supply

 By Neil Chatterjee	
 JAKARTA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia ordered hefty rice
imports on Wednesday to boost stocks by a third in the latest
sign that governments concerned about rising food prices and
dwindling supplies are rushing into the market and could drive
inflation even higher.	
 Global food prices have climbed to record highs in recent
months on shrinking supplies of wheat, corn, soybean and
oilseeds, and while rice has been less of a worry thanks to
ample supplies in the top two exporters, Thailand and Vietnam,
traders said other Asian governments may soon seek to boost rice
stocks too.	
 Adding to a sense of gathering nervousness among governments
over food supplies, China plans subsidies to boost grain output
this year, state radio said in a report on its website.	
 ""Maintaining a stable grain output increase has a very
important meaning to managing inflation expectations,
stabilizing general consumer prices, and realising rapid and
stable economic growth as well as social harmony and stability,""
the report said, citing a regular state council meeting held by
Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday. 
 Food worries have been worsened by the impact of Cyclone
Yasi in Australia. The chairman of Australia's main sugar
industry group Canegrowers said up to a quarter of the sugar
cane crop in the state of Queensland may have been lost.	
 ""Given there has been such a wide area of impact from the
this cyclone we are looking at losses on the outer edges of 5 to
10 percent and close to the centre of the cyclone up to 50
percent of the crop could be lost,"" Alf Cristaudo told Reuters
in an interview. 
 The U.S. Agriculture Department announces its latest wheat
stocks outlook at 1330 GMT on Wednesday, plus estimates of other
crops. 
 The USDA is expected to announce a drop in wheat stocks with
export demands firm despite prices trending near 30-month highs.	
 Problems with crop production in Australia as well as the
lingering effects of last summer's drought in the Black Sea
region have boosted the role of the United States on the export
market.	
 Global food prices tracked by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organisation hit their highest level on record in
January. The FAO said last week its Food Price Index rose for
the seventh month in a row to reach 231 in January, the highest
level since records began in 1990.	
 The rising prices have raised concerns over inflation,
protectionism and social unrest, factors behind the 2008 food
crisis, and prodded the G20 to promise action.	


 
 WILL RICE PRICES SURGE TOO?	
 Indonesia's government met to discuss food security on
Wednesday and Chief Economic Minister Hatta Rajasa asked state
procurement agency Bulog to secure imports to gradually boost
rice stockpiles to 2 million tonnes from the current 1.5 million
tonnes, underlining fears shortages could cause price spikes.

 Traders said other governments in the region and further
afield may also look to increase stocks despite ample supplies
in Thailand and Vietnam. 
 Bangladesh said on Wednesday it was buying 200,000 tonnes of
parboiled rice from Thailand in their first
government-to-government deal for the grain. 
 The Philippines, however, held back on importing more
despite a recommendation by a government panel to build stocks
above a 1 million tonne target. 
 Traders also warned of a remote chance the top two
exporters, facing food inflation pressures as well, may choose
to keep more supplies at home.	
 ""Rising supply from the world's top two exporters is likely
to weigh prices down. However, there could be steady demand from
traditional buyers such as the Middle East, African countries
and demand elsewhere in Asia that could help support prices,""
said Kiattisak Kallayasirivat of trading firm Novel Agritrade.	
 Indonesia surprised markets last month by buying nearly five
times as much rice as expected, and then suspended rice import
duties in a move that signalled it could look to stockpile more.	
 Its import plans are a turnaround from minimal purchases
last year and show efforts by Southeast Asia's biggest economy
to be self-sufficient in rice have not succeeded.	
 Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called on
people to start planting food at home, and told the World
Economic Forum in Davos that the next economic war could be over
the race for scarce resources, due to growing populations.	
 Food price inflation led the central bank to hike interest
rates last week for the first time in two years, and protests
over food prices were seen as a major factor in the ousting of
Indonesia's autocratic President Suharto in 1998.	
 By contrast in the Philippines, policymakers appear not to
be overtly worried about rising food costs -- the central bank
is expected to leave policy rates unchanged at a record low on
Thursday, and has said there is no evidence that commodity
prices are spilling over into the broader economy.	
 The country may buy less than 1 million tonnes of rice this
year despite a government panel recommendation for a higher
purchase volume, with forecasts of a good first quarter crop, a
government official said on Wednesday.	
 Early rains this year have helped rice crops and along with
hefty stockpiles from previous years' imports, gives Manila --
the world's biggest buyer in recent years -- room to buy less
than the record 2.45 million tonnes it purchased last year.	
 ""We are preventing over-importation because our farmers will
be disadvantaged,"" said agriculture secretary Proceso Alcala.	
 Thai rice rose to $545 per tonne from last week's $540 per
tonne on the back of loading demand after exporters committed
last month to sell 820,000 tonnes of rice to Indonesia.	
 Benchmark Thai 100 percent B-grade white rice prices
 are likely to rise to $550 a tonne by the end of
February and $567.5 a tonne in March from around $540 a tonne
now, given expectations of additional orders from Indonesia,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, a Reuters poll shows. 
 Rice lagged other staple grains last year, falling 13
percent while corn and wheat surged around 50 percent. Rice
prices have only gained 2 percent this year and are far below a
record $1,050 a tonne hit in 2008.	
 Still, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao sees Thai white
rice rising into a range of $630-$673 per tonne over the next
three months based on chart indicators. 
 Some traders say rice prices could drop in the coming weeks
on increased supply because Vietnam is due to start harvesting
its major winter-spring rice crop by end-February.	
 ""Prices will fall in March as there are no more government
deals while the Philippines has not detailed its importing plan
but it may buy less than last year,"" one said.	
 Thailand is also about to start harvesting its second crop,
expected to be around 9.5 million tonnes, the highest ever and
well above 8.8 million tonnes last year.

 By Isabel Coles
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - World stocks pulled back from a
29-month high on Wednesday as China's interest rate rise
prompted investors to book profits, while inflation expectations
sent U.S. and UK benchmark bond yields to multi-month highs.
 China raised interest rates on Tuesday for the second time
in just over six weeks, ratcheting up its battle against
inflation.
 Monetary tightening in the world's second-biggest economy,
if aggressive, could potentially put a brake on global growth
and weigh on equities and commodities. But investors remained
confident China's proactive but gradual stance will not derail
the global recovery.
 In the short term, the rate hike gave investors an excuse to
consolidate their positions after the benchmark world index
rallied nearly 4 percent since the start of the year.
 Wall Street looked set to open lower, with U.S. stock
futures down 0.3 percent.
 Investors also had their eye on an address by Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later on Wednesday, when he may
give clues on the outlook for U.S. interest rates.
 ""China is turning its focus towards inflation, rather than
(slowing) growth,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency strategist
at Credit Agricole CIB. ""What this means is that growth is
likely to continue.""
The MSCI world equity index fell 0.4 percent, having hit a
29-month peak on Tuesday, while the Thomson Reuters global stock
index was down 0.3 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.1 percent.
 Emerging stocks were down one percent while Shanghai shares
dropped 0.9 percent.
 U.S. crude oil rose 0.5 percent to $87.38 a barrel while
London crude prices jumped above $100 due to tighter North Sea
supplies.
 Bund futures were steady on the day while 10-year U.S.
Treasury yields climbed as high as 3.77 percent -- their highest
since late April -- in the wake of a lacklustre U.S. bond
auction.
 The yield on 10-year British government bonds rose as high
as 3.915 percent, its highest since May 2010.
 Concerns about inflation are putting upward pressure on
yields in the run-up to the Bank of England's monetary policy
decision on Thursday. Money markets are pricing in a small risk
of a rate rise this week and a full quarter-point hike by May.
 The dollar ticked a touch lower against a basket of major

550,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2011 06:28AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Wealthy investors looking to snaffle risky debt," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Has the time come to buy some of
the world's most unloved investments, such as Greek bonds, and
stick them in the bottom drawer?
 Hedge funds and wealthy private investors increasingly
appear to be saying yes, attracted by yields that blow away what
can be found on many other assets.
 It is not for everyone -- indeed, many mainstream investment
firms cannot follow the route -- but the idea is that a lot of
higher yielding debt with two to five years to run is promising
significant return with diminishing risks.
 Longer-term bonds or, in some cases, those with better
credit, have been losing favour because of both low yields and
the general global risk rally that has taken hold with economic
recovery.
 But at the riskier end there are signs of life.
 A good example of the phenomenon is Barclays Wealth, which
has recently encouraged its well-heeled clients to consider
buying two-year Greek government bonds .
 Battered by the debt crisis, such paper is currently
yielding more than 11 percent and, unlike longer-term paper, is
all but guaranteed by the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund bailout. 
 So Barclays considers the default or restructuring risk for
short-term paper to be slight.
 ""You have a backstop of EU money being able to come in in
case people are struggling,"" said Michael Dicks, the wealth
manager's chief economist.
 He added that IMF and EU monitoring should also ensure that
Greece sticks with its budget repair plans.
 The Greek paper is nonetheless likely to be volatile, so the
key is to buy it and hold it to maturity, locking in what
amounts to 11 percent a year plus the return of capital.
 ""What we are trying to do is provide a more attractive
(investment) than cash. They are cash-like in the sense of short
maturities,"" Dicks said.
 
 ROLLING ALONG
 A similar approach is being taken by State Street Global
Advisors, but with an eye on high-yield corporate credit rather
than troubled euro zone debt.
 Yields on high-yield, or junk, bonds differ widely depending
on the issuer, but a range of 6.0 to 6.5 percent should be
attainable on, say, five-year dollar bonds.
 Richard Lacaille, SSgA's global chief investment officer,
told a Reuters briefing recently that his firm and a number of
its clients were looking at buy-and-hold positioning.
 ""We are talking about a roll down strategy with maturities
less than five years,"" he said.
 Roll down essentially means buying a bond and keeping it as
it heads towards maturity, perhaps only selling it towards the
end if the price return by dumping on the secondary market would
bring in the same overall return.
 The risk, of course, is default, which is why the yield is
so high in the first place.
 But with signs of the global economy growing at a
near-normal pace, default rate expectations are low.
 Rating agency Moody's forecasting model, for example,
predicts that the global corporate speculative-grade default
rate will decline to just 1.5 percent by January next year.
[ID:nN28ORPS]
 Investor interest in high-yield bonds is generally running
quite high, although most of the allocation is the more typical
buy-and-expect-to-sell strategy .
Reuters global asset allocation poll for January showed
overall bond holdings at their lowest level since last February,
but with interest in high-yield debt having grown steadily since
August. [ASSET/WRAP]
 High-yield bonds now account for 12.9 percent of bond
portfolios held by poll respondents, representing many of the
largest investors in the world, well above the 9.8 percent
average for the past year.
 
 ONLY FOR SOME
 Buy and hold strategies such as these are not for everyone.
Some funds, for example, are prohibited by their mandates from
holding such high-risk debt.
 More of a barrier yet is the need to ""mark to market"", the
requirement than many institutions report the market value of
their holdings at various times.
 Buying a volatile bond such as Greece's two-year, for
example, might mean that a fund would have to write up a paper
loss on capital even if the end result would amount to an 11
percent a year investment.
 ""There are very few places in the world where you can just
buy and hold and forget,"" said Andrew Clare, professor of asset
management at Cass Business School in London
 That said, strategists with RBC Capital Markets told
reporters at a briefing this week that they were hearing about a
number of groups getting in on the short-term buy and hold
strategy.
 SSgA's Lacaille also said his clients were showing
increasing interest in holding high-yield corporates down the
curve.
 Investors who are used to taking more risk -- such as hedge
funds -- or have fewer restrictions on what they do -- such as
wealthy individuals -- were the most likely.
 Emerging market funds, in the meantime, were reported to be
taking an interest in Greece.
 The search for yield, after all, has been the main theme of
investors ever since central banks began slashing official rates
to combat the financial crisis.

 * Global grain shortage pushes prices up
 * Ukraine seeks free grain exports in 2011/12
 
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine's Farm Ministry said on
Wednesday it would review the country's grain stocks to decide
whether the ex-Soviet republic needs to restrict grain exports
for the remainder of the current season.
 ""We will re-examine grain stocks of our producers and will
make a decision,"" Farm Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk told
reporters.
 Ukraine, the world's top barley exporter and a major wheat
supplier, introduced export quotas after a drought last summer
to prevent a rise in domestic bread prices after neighbouring
Russia banned grain exports for the whole 2010/11 season.
 In October, the government introduced a 2.7 million tonne
grain export quota, and in December it extended the quotas until
March 31 and increased the total volume to 4.2 million tonnes.
 Last month Prysyazhnyuk told Reuters that the ministry would
urge the government to allow unlimited exports of grain in the
forthcoming 2011-2012 marketing season and in the last three
months of the current season.
 Last week Ukraine's Economy Ministry said it had proposed
that the government should cancel restrictions on maize exports
in the 2010/11 season.
 But Prysyazhnyuk said the government had taken into account
negative harvest news from abroad.
""We had expected good harvests in Brazil and Argentina. But
now we see that the forecasts of their grain yields are reduced.
We see a serious shortage of grain,"" Prysyazhnyuk said.
 
 PRICE PRESSURES
 Drought in Russia, which banned grain exports in the 2010/11
season, pushed global grain prices to record high levels, and
the recent news of a possible fall in the grain harvest in China
became an additional factor for the jump in prices.
 U.S. wheat futures rose half a percent on Wednesday,
building on the previous session's 2 percent rally to reach near
a 30-month high on growing concern over production in China and
the United States and strong demand.
 Wheat output in China, the world's largest producer and
consumer of the grain, may be at risk after severe winter
drought in its main northern producing regions, the United
Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation said.
 Ukraine, which harvested 16.8 million tonnes of wheat in
2010, has exported about 2.7 million tonnes so far this season,
down from 6.9 million tonnes in the same period in 2009/10 due
to quotas.
 Ukrainian wheat is traditionally cheaper that the grain
harvested in the European Union and could compete on the key
markets in the Middle East or north Africa.
Traders said on Wednesday that the lowest offer in a
Lebanese government tender to buy 22,500 tonnes of milling
wheat, which closed on Tuesday, was $414.67 a tonne C&F and the
offer was for Ukrainian origin.
 Ukrainian soft milling wheat is traded at about $340 FOB
Black Sea.

 * Impact of bad weather unclear, may have worsened deficit
 * Imports of aircraft jump ahead of January tax change

(Adds analyst comment, 
 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain's goods trade deficit
unexpectedly hit a record high in December, underscoring doubts
about UK competitiveness, though the figures were worsened by
bad weather and a tax-related jump in aircraft imports.
 The data chime with a sharp fall in UK GDP at the end of
2010 and deal a further blow to hopes that exporters will be
able to drive growth in 2011 when both the government and
consumers are tightening their belts.
 ""The deterioration in the UK's trade position in December
probably partly reflects the bad weather, but the underlying
trend is still pretty dismal,"" said Vicky Redwood at Cap ital
Economics.
 The Office for National Statistics said Britain's goods
trade gap widened to 9.25 billion pounds from 8.46 billion in
November, its highest since monthly records began in 1980.
Economists had forecast a broadly steady reading of 8.6 billion
pounds.
 There was little market reaction to the data, which is
volatile at the best of times and unlikely to influence the
outcome of Thursday's Bank of England monetary policy decision.
 BoE policymakers are expected to leave interest rates at a
record low of 0.5 percent -- where they have stood since March
2009 -- though the strength of recent inflation data has
encouraged some in the market to bet on a rise.
 December was Britain's coldest in one hundred years and
heavy snow and ice heavily disrupted air and road transport. The
statistics office said exports might have been hit harder by the
weather than imports, though it noted some evidence that part of
losses related to this were recouped before the month was over.
 ""While the data are somewhat disappointing, I would leave
them aside until we get the January figures and can assess
whether there has been a bounce back,"" said David Tinsley, an
economist at National Australia Bank.
 The data showed imports of aircraft jumped by 652 million
pounds in December ahead of a change in tax rules that would
impose VAT sales tax on commercial aircraft used on domestic
routes.
 Even excluding volatile trade in oil and goods such as
aircraft, Britain's goods trade deficit rose to 8.18 billion
pounds from 7.38 billion pounds, also a record high.
 Britain's total trade deficit, which includes services,
deteriorated to 4.83 billion pounds from 3.95 billion pounds,
its worst level since August 2005.

 * Markets await Fed Bernanke's testimony

(Recasts with euro, adds details, quote, details)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The euro gave up its gains against
the dollar on Wednesday after sources said Bundesbank head Axel
Weber will not be a candidate to replace Jean-Claude Trichet as
President of the European Central Bank.
 The dollar also climbed against the yen and the Swiss franc
on Wednesday, boosted by rising U.S. yields, while a sanguine
reception from investors to China's latest rate hike helped the
Australian dollar stay above parity.
 The euro  fell to a session low of $1.3609 from around
$1.3645 before the news and was last trading at $1.3633, flat
for the day.
 Weber, who had been considered a front-runner to succeed
Trichet when his term expires in October, is regarded as a hawk
on inflation but often finds himself in the minority.
[ID:nLDE7180MQ]
 ""He had a fairly hawkish line, and these views may not have
reflected the ECB's and have not helped him,"" said Steve Barrow,
head of G10 currency research at Standard Bank.
 ""This news has come as a surprise to many, which is why the
euro dipped. But it has held reasonably well, which suggests
there is underlying support.""
 The euro hit a three-month high of $1.3861 last week on
mounting expectations the ECB would raise interest rates later
this year. Those expectations were reined in after Trichet
sounded less hawkish than many were expecting when the board
kept rates on hold at its monthly meeting last week.
 Still, investors are pricing in chances that the ECB will
move to raise rates ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Attention
will turn next to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony at 1500
GMT to the House Budget Committee.
 ""We expect him to repeat his concerns over unsustainable
U.S. debt trends, but also that low rates are appropriate for
the time being,"" said Chris Turner, chief currency strategist at
ING.
 
 RISING YIELDS
 Bernanke will be giving testimony as the U.S. 10-year
Treasury yield hovers at nine-month highs . That has
moved yield differentials in the dollar's favour and was lending
it support, especially against the yen, traders said.
 Against the Japanese currency, the dollar gained 0.3 percent
to 82.60 yen , recovering from a fall to 81.77 yen on
Tuesday. Traders say the dollar is unlikely to run much higher
as some Japanese investors will have to buy yen ahead of a U.S.
Treasury redemption and coupon payment on Feb. 15. 
 Some traders cite stops above 82.70 yen.
 Traders said the tight correlation between U.S. yields and
the dollar/yen pair was showing signs of re-establishing itself
after having broken down earlier in the year.
 Signs of a broadening U.S recovery and some hawkish
commentary from Fed officials have contributed to higher U.S
bond yields this week. Two-year yields have risen around 30
basis points over the last week.
 ""The rise in US yields seen over the past week,
especially at the short end of the curve, are finally
starting to feed through into support for dollar/yen,"" BNP
Paribas said in a note.
 ""A break through the initial trend line resistance at the
82.95 level will trigger a dollar/yen bullish signal opening
upside potential towards 85.00.""
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent on the Swiss franc at 0.9650
francs  having hit a 2-1/2 week high of 0.9660. The next
possible targets for the dollar include the 100-day moving
average at 0.9691 francs and more importantly, its mid-January
peak of 0.9784.
 The euro hit a two-month high of 1.3179 francs , up
0.3 percent on the day, with risk appetite holding up reasonably
well despite a hike by the Chinese central bank on Tuesday.
 The markets have settled down since China delivered a 25
basis point rate hike late on Tuesday, the second increase in
little more than six weeks. [ID:nL3E7D81F7]
 The Australian dollar , highly sensitive to Chinese
interest rate policy as China is the biggest market for its top
exports, iron ore and coal, traded at $1.006  with
robust support at $1.0083, last Thursday's low.

 * Greek manager says armed men seized tanker
 * Industry says piracy crisis escalating

 (Adds release of South Korean ship)
 By Jonathan Saul and Renee Maltezou
 LONDON/ATHENS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Suspected Somali pirates
captured a U.S.-bound tanker carrying around $200 million worth
of crude oil in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday in one of the
biggest hijackings in the area so far.
 The Irene SL, the length of three soccer pitches and with 25
crew members on board, was carrying about 2 million barrels of
oil, or nearly one fifth of daily U.S. crude imports.
 The hijacking came a day after an Italian tanker carrying
oil worth more than $60 million was snatched by Somali pirates,
reinforcing industry fears that the piracy scourge is ""spinning
out of control"".
 ""This morning the vessel was attacked by armed men,"" the
Irene SL's Greece-based manager Enesel said. ""For the moment
there is no communication with the vessel.""
 Commander Susie Thomson, spokeswoman for the multinational
Combined Maritime Forces fighting piracy in the area, said the
333-metre tanker was hijacked 220 miles off Oman and was likely
to have been attacked by Somali pirates. ""We can only speculate
as to where the ship is being taken.""
 Shipping industry associations have warned that over 40
percent of the world's seaborne oil supply passing through the
Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea is at risk from Somali pirates,
who are able to operate ever further out to sea and for longer
periods, using mother ships.
 John Drake, a senior risk consultant with security firm AKE
Ltd, said pirate activity off Oman first emerged in 2009.
 ""This is a strategic area of concern because it implicates
shipping travelling to and from the Persian/Arabian Gulf,"" he
said. ""This area also does not have a significant naval presence
like the Gulf of Aden.""
 On Tuesday, pirates firing guns and rocket-propelled
grenades hijacked an Italian oil tanker in the Indian Ocean and
diverted the vessel towards Somalia.
 The Irene SL is only the fourth very large crude carrier to
have been hijacked by Somali gangs since piracy escalated in
2008, the International Maritime Bureau said. 
 
 PIRATE CRISIS
Joe Angelo, managing director of INTERTANKO, an association
whose members own the majority of the world's tanker fleet, said
the hijacking of the Irene SL marked ""a significant shift in the
impact of the piracy crisis in the Indian Ocean.""
 Angelo said the Irene SL's cargo of Kuwaiti crude oil
represented nearly 20 percent of total U.S. daily crude oil
imports and urged governments to step up anti-piracy efforts.
 ""The piracy situation is now spinning out of control into
the entire Indian Ocean,"" he told Reuters.
 ""If piracy in the Indian Ocean is left unabated, it will
strangle these crucial shipping lanes with the potential to
severely disrupt oil flows to the U.S. and to the rest of the
world.""
 Pirate gangs are making tens of millions of dollars in
ransoms, and despite successful efforts to quell attacks in the
Gulf of Aden, international navies have struggled to contain
piracy in the Indian Ocean owing to the vast distances involved.
 ""The situation is only going to worsen. With rising ransoms
pirates are able to hire more men, bribe more officials and wait
longer periods to negotiate,"" said AKE's Drake.
 ""Pirates may not set out into the Indian Ocean with specific
intent to capture oil tankers but if they see one they will
likely attack it with more determination and ferocity than other
vessel types, simply because of the potential ransom sum they
could secure through holding such a vessel.""
 Pirates last year received a record $9.5 million ransom for
the release of the Samho Dream South Korean oil tanker. A study
showed maritime piracy costs the global economy between $7 and
$12 billion a year.
 The European Union Naval Force said a South Korean fishing
vessel, the Golden Wave, and its 43 crew had been released from
pirate control. The ship was hijacked off the Kenyan coast last
October. EU NAVFOR did not say if a ransom had been paid.

 By Jason Subler and Lu Jianxin	
 SHANGHAI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Chinese shares fell on Wednesday
after the central bank raised interest rates for the second time
in just over six weeks in a bid to rein in stubbornly high
inflation, while bond yields and the yuan's mid-point edged up.	
 The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended 0.9
percent lower, with most of the losses racked up after the
midday break.	
 The slide also weighed on stocks in Hong Kong, helping to
push the Hang Seng index down 1.1 percent. 
 Property, commodity-related and financial firms led the
selloff in Shanghai on worries that higher borrowing costs could
curb consumer demand for homes and new loans. The property
sub-index fell 2.1 percent.	
 The index rose into positive territory several times during
the day and nearly breached the 250-day moving average of 2,803
points, but selling appeared to ramp up whenever that
much-watched level was nearly reached.	
 ""Investors felt pressure after five days of rises before the
long holiday,"" said Zhang Qi, analyst at Haitong Securities in
Shanghai. ""And the index also faces large pressure near the
250-day moving average.""	
 China raised interest rates late on Tuesday, the last day of
week-long Lunar New Year holidays. Gains in overseas markets in
recent sessions while Chinese bourses were closed likely helped
to cushion the Shanghai market in early trade on Wednesday.	
 
 
 PROPERTY SHARES HIT	
 Markets had largely expected further monetary tightening
measures from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) but the exact
timing of the rate rise was a surprise, coming on the last day
of the holiday.	
 The central bank raised its benchmark deposit and lending
rates by 25 basis points to 3 percent and 6.06 percent,
respectively. The increase comes ahead of data next week that is
expected to show China's inflation rose to 5.3 percent in
January, the fastest pace in more than two years.

 It was the third rate rise since China began monetary
tightening cycle in earnest in October and adds to other
measures, including seven increases in bank reserve requirements
over the past year and a slew of property measures aimed at
cooling surging housing prices.	
 Many market players now expect that the PBOC could take a
break for at least a few weeks in raising interest rates
further, though it could employ tools such as bank reserve
requirement increases, potentially giving shares some room to
rise gradually.	
 ""If there are no other measures, such as another rate hike
or a rise in bank reserve requirement ratios, the (stock) index
should rise slowly and steadily in coming weeks,"" said Zheng
Weigang, senior trader at Shanghai Securities.	
 Property shares were down throughout the day as investors
felt the sector would clearly be hit by more tightening. Top
listed property developer China Vanke fell 2
percent.	
 Financial firms also fell, though by less than the broader
market, as analysts see some room for them to benefit from
higher rates. 
 Top insurer China Life fell 0.6 percent, while
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the world's
biggest bank by market capitalisation, slid 0.5 percent.	
 
 YIELDS PLAY CATCH-UP	
 Movements in the debt market supported the idea that traders
do not expect another interest rate rise very soon.	
 Interest rate swaps (IRS) played catch-up with the official
interest rate hike, with the benchmark five-year IRS
rising 26 basis points -- just a bit more than the
25 bps rise for one-year deposits and loans.	
 But rises in bond yields rose by less, as the market expects
no more rate rises in the first quarter. The yield for the
benchmark five-year bond was quoted up 7.8 bps late
on Wednesday, trimming an earlier gain of 21 bps.	
 Lingering expectations of another rise in the bank reserve
requirements to help drain excessive liquidity in the near term
pushed money rates higher.	
 The weighted average seven-day government bond repurchase
rate , the main barometer of short-term liquidity
supply, jumped 86.7 bps to 4.14 percent.	
 
 LOOKING TO YUAN	
 Investors could take heart from signs that the PBOC may be
increasingly willing to use the yuan to help fight
inflation after it set the mid-point for Wednesday's
trading in the currency against the dollar at a record high.

 Until very recently, the PBOC was very cautious not to fan
expectations of yuan appreciation against the dollar right after
a policy rate adjustment and typically set the yuan's mid-point
stable or weaker the day after a policy move.	
 Wednesday's mid-point was set stronger even after the dollar
index rose during the Lunar New Year holiday. Its record
high was also a surprise to the market.	
 Still, the currency closed at 6.5938 per dollar in the spot
market, flat from before the holiday. So far this year the
currency has actually fallen slightly, despite mounting price
pressures, after a mini rally late last year.	
 Dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) bounced to imply
less appreciation as overseas investors bet Beijing may still
lean more towards traditional policy levers, such as interest
rates, rather than the yuan, in its anti-inflation campaign.	
 Benchmark one-year NDFs were bid at 6.4270, up
from 6.4170 overnight, with their implied yuan appreciation in
12 months dropping to 2.46 percent from 2.62 percent.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2011 04:36AM ET</span>",UK goods trade deficit hits record high in Dec," LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain's goods trade deficit hit
a record high in December as imports of aircraft jumped ahead of
a change in VAT sales tax, and bad weather caused disruption at
airports and ports.
 The figures chime with a sharp fall in UK GDP at the end of
2010 and may raise concern among economists that Britain's
recovery will not be as swift as hoped.
 The Office for National Statistics said that Britain's goods
trade gap widened to 9.247 billion pounds from 8.460 billion in
November. Economists had forecast a broadly steady reading of
8.6 billion pounds.
 December was Britain's coldest in at least one hundred years
and heavy snow and ice closed many airports, though the ONS said
they may have recovered some business later in the month.
 Even excluding volatile trade in oil and goods such as
aircraft, Britain's goods trade deficit rose to 8.175 billion
pounds from 7.382 billion pounds, also its highest since monthly
records began in 1980.
 The total trade deficit, which includes services,
deteriorated to its worst level since August 2005, increasing to
4.831 billion pounds from 3.947 billion pounds.

 By Neil Chatterjee	
 JAKARTA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia on Wednesday aimed to
lift its rice stockpiles by a third as it struggles to fight
food inflation, though steady buying by top importer the
Philippines and a bumper crop from top exporter Thailand may
ease market pressure.	
 Traders said other governments in the region and further
afield may also look to increase stocks despite ample supplies
in Thailand and No. 2 exporter Vietnam to quell food inflation.	
 ""Rising supply from the world's top two exporters is likely
to weigh prices down. However, there could be steady demand from
traditional buyers such as the Middle East, African countries
and demand elsewhere in Asia that could help support prices,""
said Kiattisak Kallayasirivat of trading firm Novel Agritrade.	
 Thai rice rose to $545 per tonne from last week's $540 per
tonne on the back of loading demand after exporters committed
last month to sell 820,000 tonnes of rice to Indonesia.	
 Indonesia asked state procurement agency Bulog to lift rice
stockpiles to 2 million tonnes on Wednesday, which followed the
country surprising markets last month by buying five times as
much rice as expected, while the Philippines also on Wednesday
said it may import less than 1 million tonnes planned this year
despite a recommendation from a government agency to go above
that level.	
 Benchmark Thai 100 percent B grade white rice prices
 are likely to rise to $550 a tonne by the end of
February and $567.5 a tonne in March from around $540 a tonne
now, given expectations of additional orders from Indonesia,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, according to a Reuters poll.	
 But rice has lagged other staple grains last year, falling
13 percent while corn and wheat surged 50 percent. Rice prices
have only gained 2 percent this year and are far below a record
$1,050 a tonne hit in 2008.	
 Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao sees Thai white rice
rising into a range of $630-$673 per tonne over the next three
months 
 Even at that level however, supplies of CBOT rough rice
, now trading around $313.5 a tonne, are unlikely to flow
heavily into Asia as local grades are preferred.	
 
 Still, perceived panic buying by governments as global food
prices have climbed to record highs in recent months on
shrinking supplies of wheat, corn and oilseeds has kept the
market watchful.	
 Indonesia surprised markets last month by buying nearly five
times as much rice as expected, and then suspended rice import
duties in a move that signalled it could look to stockpile more.	
 Growing Asian demand and speculation over panic buying has
already pushed prices for the grain higher, adding to inflation
that hit a 21-month high of 7 percent in Indonesia last month,
though Thailand and Vietnam are poised to see new harvests.	
 Indonesia's government met to discuss food security on
Wednesday and chief economic minister Hatta Rajasa said it would
gradually lift stockpiles from a current 1.5 million tonnes,
underlining its fears over shortages leading to price spikes.	
 Food price inflation led the central bank to hike interest
rates last week for the first time in two years, and protests
over food prices were seen as a major factor in the ousting of
Indonesia's long-term autocratic ruler Suharto in 1998.	
 
 NEW CROPS	
 Other traders said rice prices could drop in the coming
weeks on increased supply because Vietnam, the world's second
biggest rice exporter, is due to start harvesting its major
winter-spring rice crop by end-February.	
 Vietnam's winter-spring rice crop accounts for around 48
percent of the country's total rice production of around 39-40
million tonnes and most of the output are for exports.	
 ""Prices will fall in March as there are no more government
deals while the Philippines has not detailed its importing plan
but it may buy less than last year,"" a trader said.	
 Thailand is also about to start harvesting its second crop,
expected to be around 9.5 million tonnes, the highest ever and
well above 8.8 million tonnes last year.	
 Indonesia's own harvest will start in March, when it sees
prices starting to ease and imports are not allowed to avoid
damaging farmer earnings. The country said it had already
secured 1.33 million tonnes of imports by December.	
 Indonesia has set a target to produce 69 million tonnes of
unmilled rice this year, up from 65 million tonnes in 2010.	
 Its import buying is a turnaround from minimal purchases
last year and shows efforts by Southeast Asia's biggest economy
to be self-sufficient in the staple have not succeeded.	
 Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called on
people to start planting food at home, and told the World
Economic Forum in Davos that the next economic war could be over
the race for scarce resources, due to growing populations.	
 By contrast in the Philippines, policymakers appear not to
be overtly worried about rising food costs -- the central bank
is expected to leave policy rates unchanged at a record low on
Thursday, and has said there is no evidence that commodity
prices are spilling over into the broader economy.	
 The country may buy less than 1 million tonnes of rice this
year despite a government panel recommendation for a higher
purchase volume, with forecasts of a good first quarter crop, a
government official said on Wednesday.	
 Early rains this year have helped rice crops and along with
hefty stockpiles from previous years' imports, gives Manila --
the world's biggest buyer in recent years -- room to buy less
than the record 2.45 million tonnes it purchased last year.	
 ""We are preventing over-importation because our farmers will
be disadvantaged,"" said agriculture secretary Proceso Alcala.

(Adds CEO comments, analyst, more details)
 By David Jones
 LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain's Reckitt Benckiser missed
fourth-quarter earnings forecasts on Wednesday as market growth
in the consumer goods industry declined and price competition
sharpened, sending its shares lower in early trade.
 Reckitt, which took over Durex condoms and Scholl sandals
maker SSL late last year, said it was looking to outperform in
an industry that lacks growth.
 Chief executive Bart Becht was confident about 2011 saying
his group would offset hefty input price rises with selective
price rises and cost savings, but he is facing tough markets in
Europe and North America.
 ""We are facing two worlds, Western Europe and North America
are not showing much growth while Eastern Europe and other
developing areas are growing well,"" he told a briefing.
 The group also faces the threat of generic competition
emerging for its heroin substitute drug Suboxone, the main
revenue generator for its pharmaceuticals division which
accounts for nearly one quarter of group profits.
 Reckitt shares fell 3.5 percent to 33.24 pound by 0900 GMT,
to be the worst performer in the FTSE 100, after being one of
the best performers in the index over the last decade.
 Analyst Graham Jones at brokers Panmure Gordon described the
results as mixed with pharma growth strong helped by good
growth of a sublingual film version of Suboxone, offsetting a
weaker than expected base business.
 ""24 percent of group operating profits in 2010 was pharma,
and there obviously remains a significant risk of generic
entry,"" Jones added.
 The group, which makes Finish dishwash products, Cillit Bang
cleaners and Nurofen painkillers, said fourth-quarter earnings
rose 14 percent to 69.0p a share, below a company-compiled
consensus of 73.7p and Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus of
72.2p.
 Its 2010 dividend rose 15 percent to 115 pence, in line with
paying out 50 percent of its annual earnings to shareholders.
 Reckitt expected sales to rise 4 percent this year and
operating profit growth above that from its businesses,
excluding SSL but including pharmaceuticals.
 Becht said input price inflation for crude oil, plastics,
palm oil and rubber was a concern and challenge but expects
margins to rise in 2011 as it raises prices and cuts costs.
 Becht was the best-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100 in
2009, walking away with 92 million pounds in salary and bonus
thanks in large part to the strong performance of his stock
options over past years.
 During his 10 year tenure, the company's shares have
outperformed the FTSE 100 by over three times as well as beating
its peer group.
 Reckitt bought SSL in early November for 2.54 billion pounds
($4.1 billion) and then agreed to buy India's Paras
Pharmaceuticals the following month for $726 million to expand
its fast-growing health and personal care business.
 Reckitt's competitors said they were suffering from
commodity price rises such as Unilever last week, and earlier
this week British group McBride, Europe's biggest maker of
own-brand household cleaning products for retailers.

 * Exports rise 0.5 pct versus forecast for 1.0 pct gain
 * Imports unexpectedly drop 2.3 pct vs f'cast 0.5 pct gain

(Adds details, background, quote)
 BERLIN, Feb 9 (Reuters) - German exports rose less than
expected in December but still widened the trade surplus and
likely contributed significantly to fourth quarter growth in
Europe's largest economy.
 Seasonally adjusted exports gained 0.5 percent while imports
unexpectedly dropped 2.3 percent, broadening the trade balance
to 14.0 billion euros, the Federal Statistics Office said.
 Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the balance to
rise to 12.1 billion euros and imports to gain 0.5 percent.
Exports were forecast to gain 1.0 percent. 
 ""The second consecutive increase in German exports shows
that the export-led recovery is alive and kicking,"" said Carsten
Brzeski, an analyst at ING Financial Markets. ""Despite fiscal
consolidation in other euro zone countries and slower global
demand, products 'made in Germany' remain a bestseller.""
 Germany's economy has outpaced that of its peers, although
industrial orders and output numbers for December this week both
slid well into negative territory. 
 Imports also fell in both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted
terms, offering little sign of the pickup in domestic demand
that euro zone neighbours hope will allow them to benefit from
the German recovery.
 ""The pickup is more dampened than expected,"" said Alexander
Koch at Unicredit. ""But if you look at the entire final quarter,
there was a considerable increase overall. The exports likely
contributed significantly to growth.""
 Leading indicators in Germany have climbed to multi-year
highs, suggesting the recovery in the traditionally export-led
economy is becoming more broad-based, fanning hopes of stronger
consumer spending.
 Carmakers, for example have made a strong start to 2011 on
the back of booming growth in China and India. Volkswagen
 has said it was currently undergoing significant
growth and expects a ""robust"" year ahead. [ID:nWEA3304]
 Economic prospects for key German trade partners like the
United States remain mixed, while emerging nations such as India
and China still power ahead at the risk of high commodity prices
widening trade gaps and driving inflation.

(Fixes link to rates poll)	
 By Simon Rabinovitch	
 BEIJING, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Inflation is proving a tougher
foe than the Chinese government imagined and, as that
realisation sinks in, risks are tilting toward more aggressive
monetary tightening than investors expected.	
 So far, markets have been little perturbed by Tuesday's
interest rate increase, Beijing's third since October, seeing it
as just another small step in an incremental campaign aimed at
reining in prices without unduly harming growth.	
 They are in danger of under-playing both the buildup of
price pressures in China and the determination of officials,
sensitive to inflation's historic role as a cause of political
unrest in the country, to regain control.	
 ""It's begun to sink in for policy makers how serious
inflation and the property bubble are. Over the last month or
two, there has been a lot of soul searching about how to
normalise policies as quickly as possible,"" said Isaac Meng,
economist with BNP Paribas in Beijing.	
 A glance at the forecasting record of China-focused
economists shows how investors have consistently under-estimated
the severity of tightening, a pattern that appears to be
repeating itself.	
 At the start of last October, the consensus prediction of
analysts was that China would wait until the second quarter this
year to raise benchmark rates. But just a few weeks later, it
surprised with an increase.	
 At the start of December, the dominant view was that China
would lift rates by a total of 75 basis points by the end of
2011. But the government has already raised rates by 50 basis
points and there are still 11 months to go in the year.	
 
 Indeed, economists now see 50 basis points of further
tightening before the end of the year, according to a Reuters
poll conducted on Wednesday after the latest rate rise.	
 That median forecast could again wind up being too low,
failing to register a change of tune in Beijing.	
 Chinese officials have in recent months expressed concern
about raising rates too quickly, contending that higher rates
would be counter-productive, attracting hot money inflows and so
adding to the excessive liquidity at the root of rising
inflation.	
 But Jianguang Shen, an economist with Mizuho Securities in
Hong Kong, noted that a jump in inflation at the start of this
year was shifting the terms of the debate.	
 ""The central bank's decision to raise rates may represent
the required change of view towards more aggressive rate hikes,""
he said.	
 Although annual inflation slowed to 4.6 percent in December,
analysts polled by Reuters expect data next week to show it
picked up to 5.3 percent in January, the fastest pace in more
than two years. 
 
 MORE WEIGHT ON RATES	
 In the latest rate rises announced on Tuesday, the central
bank increased benchmark one-year deposit rates by 25 basis
points to 3 percent and one-year lending rates by a similar
amount to 6.06 percent.	
 Global investors have taken the increase in their stride.
The Dow Jones industrial average notched a seventh straight day
of gains and commodities markets, hit initially, soon rebounded,
judging that the move was too small to weaken China's voracious
demand for raw materials. 
 As is its policy custom, China leaned most heavily on
administrative measures in its tightening over the past year,
ordering state-owned banks to lend less and forcing them seven
times to lock up more of their deposits as required reserves.	
 Although it is too early to declare that Beijing has settled
on a new model, its policy mix does appear to be changing
somewhat. Since late December, the central bank has raised
interest rates twice and required reserves only once.	
 ""Required reserve ratio hikes and administrative
interventions cannot substitute for rate adjustments in
containing inflation expectations,"" Shen Minggao, Citigroup's
chief China economist, said in a note to clients.	
 Despite this week's interest rate increase, real deposit
rates are still deep into negative territory. 
 As inflation erodes the value of their bank savings,
households are looking to preserve wealth via other assets. The
property market, which the government has been trying to cool
for the better part of a year, beckons as the favourite
alternative.	
 
 AMPLE CREDIT	
 Looking to entice savers to keep cash in banks, Beijing has
made long-term deposits more attractive. While raising benchmark
one-year deposit rates by 75 basis points since October, the
central bank has raised the five-year tenor by 140 basis points.	
 But this layered approach to interest rates will only be
helpful at the margins. Deposits with terms of five years or
more account for a mere 0.1 percent of all bank savings, while
demand deposits, which can be withdrawn at any time, make up
about 50 percent, bank analysts say. 
 And even if the central bank does raise benchmark rates
quite sharply, the nature of the state-directed financial system
in China means that the volume of credit is a far more important
determinant of monetary conditions than the price of credit.	
 On that count, Tao Wang, chief China economist with UBS,
said that a likely 7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) in new
lending this year would be too much.	
 ""The rate hikes may be ahead of what the market expects, but
I still think the central bank is falling behind the curve in
terms of inflation and the economy,"" she said. ""What I would
consider aggressive is if the government suddenly tightens the
credit target and stops approving new projects.""

 * Bank sees rupiah above 8,900 per dollar; inflation above target
 * Analysts say bank wants to eliminate SBIs
(Updates with details, quotes, auction results)	
 By Aditya Suharmoko	
 JAKARTA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank will no longer regularly
sell its six-month SBI debt in monthly auctions in an attempt to drive
investment to longer-term instruments, as emerging markets around the world seek
to counter hot money flows.	
 Bank Indonesia (BI) sold 14 trillion rupiah ($1.57 billion) of nine-month
SBIs and 30 billion rupiah of nine-month sharia SBIs in Wednesday's auction,
both with a rate of 6.70542 percent, after receiving offers totalling 37.22
trillion rupiah.	
 It plans to issue a six-month term deposit this week, while aiming to sell a
nine-month term deposit at a later date, deputy governor Budi Mulya said before
the auction.	
 Analysts said the bank was moving to replace SBIs with term deposits --
which are not tradeable and must be held to maturity -- and short-term deposit
facilities (FASBI) to absorb excess liquidity in the financial system.	
 As of Feb. 1, foreigners held 142.68 trillion rupiah of SBIs, or 23 percent
of the total, latest data shows -- down from 200.11 trillion rupiah in the first
week of January.	
 In a BI auction last month, the weighted average yield for six-month SBIs
was 6.1 percent and for nine-month SBIs 6.5 percent.	
 Authorities are trying to smooth volatility in short-term instruments amid
fears that any sharp outflow of funds could threaten stability and the rupiah.	
 Indonesian stocks, bonds and the currency fell last month as investors took
profits from a strong rally in 2010 and worried that the central bank was behind
the curve in tackling growing inflationary pressures.	
 Mulya said he expected the rupiah to strengthen to above 8,900 to the dollar
in coming months, from around 8,915 currently, and that inflation could rise
above the target of 4-6 percent this year.	
 The central bank last week hiked its key policy rate by 25 basis points to
6.75 percent, surprising many market watchers, in an attempt to head off price
pressures. SBIs are expensive for BI because the yields are based on its
benchmark interest rate.	
 From Nov. 5 to Jan. 14 foreign investors bought 17.7 trillion rupiah of
six-month SBIs after they could no longer purchase the three-month SBIs.	
 ""Efforts to shift excess liquidity that is piling up in short tenors to
longer tenors are expected to reduce the dependency of market players on placing
short-term funds in BI's monetary instruments, supporting financial deepening,""
said BI spokesman Difi A. Johansyah.	
 BI introduced a 28-day minimum holding period for its SBIs in June last
year, driving investors out of a one-month tenor that had been popular for its
high yields and liquidity and towards three- and six-month tenors and government
debt.	
 It then stopped selling three-month SBIs in November last year. It has
issued term deposits as replacement, with a five-month term deposit first
introduced last month. 
 ""This is BI's scenario: to eventually eliminate SBIs,"" said Juniman, an
economist at Bank Internasional Indonesia in Jakarta.	
 ""In effect, foreigners can't put in funds that may destabilise the rupiah.
They will move to the bond market then, which will be positive to finance the
state budget and in driving the real sector.""	
 Analysts see the government could start issuing T-bills with maturity of
less than a year once the central bank stops issuing SBIs.	
 ""The government shouldn't be too afraid on refinancing risks by issuing
shorter-dated T-bills. The instruments are needed by banks,"" said Anton Gunawan,
an economist at Bank Danamon in Jakarta.	
 Ultra-low interest rates in developed markets have been driving a flood of
money towards emerging markets where yields are higher, leading countries from
Taiwan to Brazil to impose capital controls to stem the rise in their
currencies.

 * Wants to fix Colombia, Panama pacts as soon as possible
 * Wants Congress to end Cold War blot on trade with Russia
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama wants
to win congressional approval of a free trade pact with South
Korea in the next few months and to resolve issues blocking
trade deals with Panama and Colombia ""as soon as possible this
year,"" the top U.S. trade official said on Wednesday.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, in testimony prepared
for a House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee
hearing, said the White House also wants Congress to remove a
Cold War-era stain on relations with Russia by approving
""permanent normal trade relations.""
 Republicans, since winning control of the House and gaining
seats in the Senate in November, have pressed Obama for a
timetable for action on free trade pacts with South Korea,
Colombia and Panama that were negotiated and signed during the
administration of former President George W. Bush.
 The deals have been stalled because of strong opposition
from U.S. union groups and many rank-and-file Democrats,
especially to the South Korea and Colombia pacts.
 Even before the election, Obama said he wanted to resolve
auto industry complaints that the South Korea agreement failed
to open that country's market to American cars while phasing
out remaining U.S. tariffs on South Korean vehicles.
 But a deal to win the support of the United Auto Workers
and Ford Motor Co, the original pact's harshest critics, did
not come together until Dec. 3.
 ""To bring home its promise -- billions of dollars in
exports and tens of thousands of jobs in America -- the
president intends to submit the U.S.-Korea trade agreement to
Congress in the next few weeks and looks forward to working
with you to secure its approval this spring,"" Kirk said in
testimony for a hearing on the president's trade agenda.
 U.S. labor groups still strongly oppose the Colombia
agreement on the grounds that country has not done enough to
stop the murders of trade unionists and prosecute those
responsible for past killings.
 ANTI-UNION VIOLENCE
 Business groups looking to expand exports say critics are
ignoring the progress Colombia has made over the past decade to
reduce violence. They have worked with Republicans to press the
Obama administration to move forward on the pact.
 They also want Congress to pass the agreement with Panama,
which has been blocked by Democratic concerns over the
country's tax secrecy laws and labor regulations.
 ""I can tell you today that the president has directed me to
immediately intensify engagement with Colombia and Panama with
the objective of resolving the outstanding issues as soon as
possible this year and bringing those agreements to Congress
for consideration immediately thereafter,"" Kirk said in the
administration's clearest statement of intent yet.
 A senior administration official, speaking on condition
that he not be identified, said the White House wanted to folow
the model of consultation with Congress and stakeholders used
in the South Korean talks to reach deals with Panama and
Colombia that have broad support.
 Kirk also said the administration wanted to work with
Congress ""this year to grant Russia permanent normal trade
relations, so that U.S. firms and workers fully benefit from
Russia's accession to the WTO (World Trade Organization).""
 That would involve Congress lifting the so-called
Jackson-Vanik amendment, which was passed in 1974 and tied U.S.
trade relations with the Soviet Union to the right of Soviet
Jews to emigrate freely.
 Russia has been in compliance with the provision since the
1990s, but the law remains on the books and is a point of
friction between the two countries as the Obama administration
strives to improve relations.
 Moscow hopes by May or June to finish a 17-year bid to join
the World Trade Organization. If that occurs, the United States
would be obligated under the term of a WTO agreement to remove
the Jackson-Vanik amendment for Russia.

 * Yuan mid-point at record high as c.bank fights inflation
 * Shares in property firms hit; sub-index down 0.6 pct
 * Insurers seen benefitting from higher rates

 By Jason Subler and Lu Jianxin	
 SHANGHAI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Chinese property firms
fell on Wednesday after the central bank raised interest rates
for the second time in just over six weeks to rein in stubbornly
high inflation, although the broader market held largely steady.	
 The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index inched down
just 0.03 percent by the mid-day break ,
after the market reopened on Wednesday following a
week-long break for the Lunar New Year holiday. Insurers rose
and banks largely fell.	
 Markets had largely expected further monetary tightening
measures from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) but the exact
timing of the rate rise was a surprise coming on the last day of
the Lunar New Year holiday.	
 A strong performance in international equity markets over
the past week also helped support sentiment.	
 Investors will also take heart from signs that the PBOC may
be turning more to the yuan to help fight inflation
after it set the mid-point for Wednesday's trading in
the currency against the dollar at a record high. 
 Still, the longer-term outlook for China's equity markets --
which have lagged behind other regional markets so far this year
after ranking as the worst performers in Asia last year -- will
depend partly on the pace and nature of further monetary
tightening, analysts said.	
 ""While the impact of this expected rate hike is seen as
muted, investors will watch for future tightening steps,"" said
Zheng Weigang, senior trader at Shanghai Securities.	
 ""If there are no other measures, such as another rate hike
or a rise in bank reserve requirement ratios, the (stock) index
should rise slowly and steadily in coming weeks, supported by
strong economic growth and corporate earnings.""	
 
 The PBOC announced on Tuesday that benchmark one-year
deposit and lending rates would rise by 25 basis points to 3
percent and 6.06 percent respectively.	
 It marked the third rate rise since China began monetary
tightening cycle in earnest in October and adds to other
measures, including seven increases in bank reserve requirements
over the past year and a slew of property measures to calm the
housing market.	
 
 WINNERS AND LOSERS	
 China's 2,000-plus listed companies will post their 2010
earnings results over the next couple of months. Analysts expect
them to post a combined 30 to 40 percent rise in their net
profits from 2009.	
 Various sectors performed very differently in response to
the latest rate rise, underscoring the policy-related jitters
that have hung over the market for the past year.	
 The main property sub-index dropped 0.6 percent,
with top listed property developer China Vanke
falling by the same degree, as higher borrowing rates could
crimp demand.	
 Conversely, insurers rose as higher rates are seen as
boosting their investment returns, particularly in bonds. Most
bond yields rose by about 10 basis points on Wednesday. Top
insurer China Life was up 0.9 percent.	
 Banks largely fell, although some analysts said their net
interest margins -- the gap between deposit and lending rates --
appeared set to increase on the latest rate rise.

 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the
world's biggest bank by market capitalisation, slipped 0.2
percent.	
 Steelmakers and other commodity-related firms mostly fell,
even though Shanghai futures for steel rebar and rubber hit
record highs after the reopening of the market, catching up with
price rises elsewhere during the past week.	
 Benchmark sugar futures fell after the ICE futures
U.S. sugar contract dropped by over 4.5 percent on Tuesday,
partly on account of China's rate rise.	
 
 YUAN CONTINUES RISE	
 A bright spot for many investors from China's fight against
inflation, which is expected to have picked up in January to 5.3
percent, the highest in more than two years, could be Beijing's
increased willingness to loosen the reins on the yuan, as a way
of keeping prices of imported grain and other goods down.	
 The PBOC set a record-high mid-point for the yuan on
Wednesday. The currency rose to 6.5836 per dollar in the spot
market, up from 6.5938 at the close on Feb. 1, the last trading
before the holiday.	
 ""Setting the yuan's mid-point at a record high right after
an interest rate hike is a strong indication that the government
wants to use the currency as one of the weapons to fight against
inflation,"" said a dealer at an Asian bank in Shanghai.	
 ""China's strong economic growth has apparently eased
resistance from domestic critics of yuan appreciation, paving
the way for the currency to rise at a faster pace this year.""	
 Four currency dealers showed they maintained their forecast
for the yuan to appreciate by 5 percent to 6 percent this year,
compared with a rise of 3.6 percent last year.	
 Still, dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) bounced
slightly as overseas investors bet Beijing may still lean more
towards traditional policy levers, such as interest rates,
rather than the yuan for its anti-inflation campaign.	
 Benchmark one-year NDFs were bid at 6.4230, up
from 6.4170 overnight, with their implied yuan appreciation in
12 months dropping to 2.53 percent from 2.62 percent.

 SINGAPORE, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Wednesday
after China's latest interest rate rise, but government bond
yields rose and the dollar and Swiss franc eased as investors
bet Beijing's policy tightening would not derail hopes of a
sustained economic recovery.	
 Developed equity markets outperformed emerging ones,
continuing a rotation of funds that has been in place since the
start of the year, although some analysts predicted strong Asian
growth would reverse the trend eventually.	
 U.S. S&P 500 futures fell 0.3 percent and financial
spreadbetters were calling major European markets to open
flat-to-lower. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average
notched a seventh straight day of gains, rising 0.6
percent, as surprisingly strong sales by McDonald's
boosted optimism about consumer spending.	
 Technical indicators show the average is overbought after a
strong run-up that began in September, leaving U.S. markets
prone to a pullback or a correction.	
 China raised interest rates by 25 basis points late on
Tuesday, its second increase in just over six weeks. The timing
was a surprise, coming on the final day of the Lunar New Year
holiday, but investors had been expecting further tightening
from Beijing to rein in stubbornly high inflation.

 ""Chinese policymakers' efforts to rein in overheating
pressures are now seen in a relatively more positive light by
global investors in that they will help slow growth to a more
sustainable pace, while other engines of growth in the region
begin to rev up,"" said Samarjit Shankar, analyst at BNY Mellon.	
 
 Japan's Nikkei hit a 9-month high before retreating
to close down 0.2 percent as bank shares were hit by
profit-taking, but Australia's benchmark index rose 0.3
percent and New Zealand shares also gained. 
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
fell 0.8 percent, weighed down by a 1.2 percent
decline in South Korean stocks , with market players
citing weakness in firms such as Hyundai Motor that
are most exposed to China and a stronger won . 
 ""The Chinese rate hike had been expected for some time,""
said Lee Sun-yeb, a market analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp in
Seoul. ""However, investors are reacting to it by offloading
issues that are sensitive to forex swings and Chinese demand.""	
 Chinese shares also fell, with the mainland market
down 1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng off 0.6 percent.	
 Japan has been Asia's best performing market so far this
year as healthier corporate profits and worries about building
inflationary pressures have encouraged investors to switch money
from fast-growing emerging markets -- last year's star
performers -- to developed market equities.	
 ""I expect developed markets to outperform for a few months
but Asia and emerging markets should come back with a vengeance
in the second-half of the year,"" said Khiem Do, chairman of the
Asia multi-asset team at Barings Asset Management in Hong Kong. 
 While monetary policy in the rich world remains
ultra-loose, central banks in emerging markets, especially in
Asia, have been tightening policy to rein in inflation fuelled
by rising commodity and energy prices and strong domestic
growth.	
 Indonesia raised rates last week and South Korea is expected
to announce a back-to-back rate increase on Friday, while
central banks in India and Brazil both hiked last month.	
 Traders said markets were positioned for more rate hikes in
China and Indonesia, but some others such as India and Korea are
beginning to look attractive from a fixed income perspective as
markets may be bracing for a lot more rate increases than what
may be ultimately delivered.	
 
 INFLATION STILL IN FOCUS	
 The Swiss franc , seen as a safe-haven currency, fell
across the board on Wednesday and the dollar index , which
measures the U.S. currency against a basket of major currencies,
slipped 0.1 percent. 
 Foreign exchange strategists said China's rate rise could
support Asian currencies by underscoring policymakers
determination to keep a lid on inflation.	
 ""The recent moves by China will give more room for other
Asian countries to raise rates and regional equity markets will
react negatively to this,"" said Wilfred Sit, Head of Asia
Pacific Investment Strategy, Mirae Asset Global Investments (HK)
Limited. ""Other more freely floating Asian currencies will
continue to appreciate.""	
 Increased investor appetite for riskier assets was evident
in the bond market, with the five-year Japanese government bond
yield climbing to a 15-month high and 10-year U.S.
Treasury yields at a 9-month high, continuing a
global trend of rising yields on government debt on expectations
of an improving economy.	
 ""The market seems to want to price in a rate hike by the
Federal Reserve,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.	
 Gold , often seen as an inflation hedge, was little
changed around $1,363 an ounce, after rising around 1 percent in
the previous session.	
 U.S. crude oil futures rose 44 cents to $87.38 a barrel
after U.S. data showed an unexpected drawdown in stocks. 
 News of China's rate hike hit commodities markets in London
and New York initially, but prices soon rebounded as investors
felt the size of the increase was not enough to stifle China's
voracious demand for raw materials.

 By Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - World stocks and industrial
metals managed to claw their way slightly higher while oil
prices fell in volatile trade on Tuesday after China raised
interest rates for the second time in six weeks, spurring
worries that global growth will be crimped.
 As commodities took the initial hit from China's move, the
commodity-sensitive Australian dollar fell and bolstered the
euro, which rallied broadly on demand from Asian central banks.
The U.S. dollar and Swiss franc eased across the board as
investors ventured away from safe-haven currencies after
tensions in Egypt eased.
 In an intensifying bid to tame high inflation, China said
it would raise its benchmark one-year deposit rate by 25 basis
points to 3 percent.
 China is the world's biggest consumer of copper, an
industrial metal often viewed as a barometer for economic
conditions, and the world's second-biggest consumer of energy.
 Copper, mirrored by tin, tumbled on the news initially but
bounced to a slightly firmer finish with demand remaining
robust for this year. The metal has been reaching successive
record highs since the beginning of February. [ID:nLDE71718U]
 The impact from China's rate hike on other asset classes
was limited.
 ""The rate hike is important, but it isn't at a critical
level where it becomes troublesome,"" said Michael Mullaney, a
portfolio manager who helps manage $9.5 billion at Fiduciary
Trust Co in Boston.
 Global stocks coasted, with major averages lingering near
2-1/2-year highs. Wall Street rose on the thinnest volume this
year as gains in consumer discretionary stocks offset losses in
energy shares and lifted the Dow to the seventh consecutive day
of gains.
 Asian markets were set for a higher open as the front month
futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock index <0#NK:> trading
in Chicago rose 30 points, or 0.28 percent, to 10,695. Asian
markets will reopen on Wednesday after week-long Lunar New Year
holidays.
 China's reminder about inflationary worries around the
world supported gold, which rose and pushed through resistance
levels. At the U.S. market close, however, spot gold 
trimmed its gains, edging down 0.1 percent, or 96 cents, to

589,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2011 05:20PM ET</span>",US business defends capital controls in trade pacts," WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A coalition of leading
business groups has urged the Obama administration to reject a
call to give U.S. free trade partners more freedom to control
the flow of capital in and out of their countries.
 Loosening rules on capital controls in future free trade
agreements and bilateral investment treaties would be both
""counterproductive and unjustified,"" the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, American Petroleum Institute and 15 other groups said
in a letter on Monday to top U.S. officials.
 It ""would undermine the very policies the president is
actively promoting: expanding U.S. exports; supporting and
generating good-paying American jobs; and advancing broader
national economic, foreign policy, and national security
objectives, such as the rule of law, anti-corruption
disciplines, poverty reduction and political stability,"" they
said.
 The letter was sent to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk and other top officials in President
Barack Obama's administration.
 The debate erupted as the Obama administration pushes to
substantially complete talks on a regional trade pact with
eight countries in the Asia Pacific region by November.
 The proposed TransPacific Partnership pact would include
Australia, Peru, Chile, Singapore, which already have free
trade agreements with the United States, as well as Vietnam,
Malaysia, New Zealand and Brunei, which do not.
 More than 250 economists in a letter to Clinton, Geither
and Kirk called last week for more lenient capital controls
rules than Washington had negotiated in previous free trade
pacts.
 The economists, who included Nobel laureate Joseph
Stiglitz, said new research by the International Monetary Fund
and others found restricting the inflow of short-term capital
can help developing nations ""stem the development of dangerous
asset bubbles and currency appreciations and generally grant
nations more autonomy in monetary policy-making.""
 Many U.S. free trade pacts and investment treaties strictly
limit the use of capital controls and give private foreign
investors ""the power to effectively sue governments in
international tribunals over alleged violations of these
provisions,"" the economists said.
 Some recent pacts required a ""cooling off"" period before an
investor could sue and also limited the amount of compensation
they could win. ""However these minor reforms do not go far
enough to ensure that governments have the authority to use
such legitimate policy tools,"" the economists said.

 * Higher global oil demand due to stronger economy
 * Industrialized oil inventories to fall 115 mln barrels
 (adds comments from EIA analyst, energy analyst))
 By Tom Doggett and Timothy Gardner
 WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. government's energy
forecaster on Tuesday revised up its estimate for global oil
demand this year, but also said more crude from major non-OPEC
oil producing countries will help fill the gap in the supply
shortfall.
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration, in its latest
monthly forecast, said top oil exporter and de facto OPEC
leader Saudi Arabia is also pumping more crude than previously
thought, about 100,000 barrels per day extra during both
November and December.
 However, most of that extra Saudi oil is being used as fuel
to run domestic power plants, with little left to export,
according to EIA. ""Industry analysts have noticed an increase
in Saudi Arabia's direct burn of crude oil for power
generation,"" said Erik Kreil, an EIA analyst.
 Phil Flynn, energy analyst at PFG Best in Chicago, said the
kingdom's use of its own oil for electricity shows the Saudi
economy is strong.
 ""This really has been the unsung story of global oil
demand. We have seen Mideast demand rise over recent years but
it has been overshadowed by growth in the emerging markets,"" he
said.
 Rising Saudi demand also means oil that could have made it
to international markets will instead be burned domestically.
 Additional supply will be needed as the EIA said the world
will consume about 140,000 bpd more in oil than it had forecast
just last month, with demand now expected to average a record
88.16 million bpd this year. Global oil use jumps another 1.9
percent next year to 89.79 million bpd, the agency said.
 Higher oil demand reflects the strong recovery of the
global economy, which is expected to grow 3.9 percent this year
and 4 percent next year, the EIA said.
 Non-OPEC oil production is forecast to increase by 310,000
bpd this year, with most of that output coming from China and
Brazil.
 Strong global oil demand will also cut into the petroleum
inventories held by the industrialized nations, with oil stocks
expected to decline by 115 million barrels over the next two
years to the middle of their five-year average range by the end
of 2012, the EIA said.

 By Steven Scheer
 HERZLIYA, Israel, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Bank of Israel Governor
Stanley Fischer said on Tuesday recent measures taken by the
central bank to battle the speculative flow of capital into the
country were undesired but necessary.
 Fischer told a conference the goal of the steps, including
imposing a reserve requirement of foreign exchange derivative
deals, was meant to relieve pressure on the shekel .
 ""We are undertaking administrative measures to moderate
short-term inflows, which have created the undesired effect on
our exchange rate,"" Fischer said. ""These controls are undesired
and (we) hope they are temporary, but they are needed.""
 On Monday, the central bank's supervisor of banks issued an
order requiring that local and foreign banks report their
balance of foreign exchange derivatives on a monthly basis, a
copy of the order obtained by Reuters showed. For more
see[ID:nLDE7161GQ].
 Last month, the Bank of Israel imposed a reserve
requirement on some foreign exchange derivative deals and said
it will require Israelis and foreigners to report on
transactions in foreign exchange swaps and forwards of more
than $10 million in one day. [ID:nLDE70J1KN]
 In December foreigners made swaps worth $76 billion
compared with $19 billion by Israelis and up from $59 billion
by foreigners alone in November.
 Foreigners' investment in Bank of Israel bills jumped by
$18 billion in 2010 to $28 billion, a level Fischer said ""is
huge and puts pressure on the exchange rate.""
 The shekel had reached a 27-month peak of 3.52 per dollar
in early January and the central bank has intervened repeatedly
to contain the currency's advance. It bought $2.085 billion of
foreign currency in January to bring its forex reserves to a
record $73.4 billion.
 The shekel weakened to 3.71 per dollar last week but has
since gained back to a rate of 3.65.
 Fischer, who has raised Israel's benchmark interest rate by
1.75 percentage points since August 2009, said that while there
were successful international rules in place to govern global
trade, there were no such laws overseeing foreign exchange
markets or capital movements.
 He said it wasn't possible to set rules establishing how
much central banks could intervene in markets, but he added
that some standards for capital movements were needed.
 ""It is important that the IMF is now trying to develop such
rules, to figure out what works and what doesn't work when the
exchange rate starts to appreciate and ... what measures they
can take that are acceptable from the viewpoint of managing the
international economy,"" he told the conference.
 ""Those are rules we have to develop just as we developed
rules gradually in the years since the 1950s that produced a
global trading system,"" he added.
 Fischer rejected the notion of a global ""currency war"" that
has led to steep appreciation of the shekel and Latin American
currencies, which has forced central banks to intervene.
 The Bank of Israel and Latin American central banks
continue to intervene to try to prevent rapid appreciation in
their respective currencies, which damages exports.
 Fischer said the U.S. Federal Reserve was not using
monetary policy to create a devaluation of the dollar and
inflict harm on other countries.
 ""I believe the U.S. is doing what needs to be done for
growth. Furthermore, I believe that when the U.S. starts
growing more rapidly, the dollar will strengthen,"" he said,
adding European countries are also trying to get out of
recession.
 ""This is not to say that there are no countries that use
their currencies as a major part of their economic policy. Of
course I am referring particularly to China which has kept its
currency lower than the market would want it to be if the
government was not intervening.""

 * Euro supported by Asia demand, risk appetite
 * U.S. dollar weaker across the board
(Recasts; updates prices, adds quotes, changes byline)
 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - An appetite for riskier
currencies strongly favored the euro versus the U.S. dollar and
Swiss franc on Tuesday, with more gains seen as slightly calmer
headlines from the Middle East reduced the appeal of safe-haven
currencies.
 The euro gained after underperforming for most of the past
week, lifted by demand from Asian central banks and buying
against the Australian dollar after a Chinese interest rate
hike fueled concerns over that country's economic growth and
demand for commodities.
 ""Safe-haven currencies fared well during the height of the
tensions in Egypt last week, but as the headlines subside
somewhat investors are unwinding some of those positions in
exchange for riskier currencies,"" said Greg Anderson, G10
strategist at CitiFX in New York.
 Weak demand for a U.S. Treasury bond sale had a slight
negative impact on the dollar, he said.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices touched session lows in early
afternoon trading after weaker-than-expected results at a $32
billion auction of three-year government debt. The note sale is
the first leg of this week's $72 billion February refunding.
 Traders said central bank buying of yen and fiscal year-end
repatriation in Japan have supported the yen against the dollar
despite a surge in U.S. yields in recent weeks.
 The U.S. dollar struggled against a major currency basket,
slipping 0.1 percent to 77.918 <.DXY> and lost 0.1 percent
against the yen  to 82.21.
 ""Over the next couple of weeks the euro will likely stay
within a range and not go below $1.3509 or above $1.3862,""
Anderson said.
 The euro rose above key resistance at $1.3680, a high on
electronic trading platform EBS last Friday. If euro/dollar
manages to extend beyond $1.3680, analysts see the next
resistance level at $1.3767, the Feb. 2 low.
 The euro's strength against the dollar could prove to be
temporary, with comments from European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet last week sharply diminishing expectations
of a near-term European Central Bank rate hike.
 The euro  gained 0.4 percent versus the greenback
to $1.3646 as investors booked profits on long dollar positions
taken in the last four days.
 Other euro-linked assets were also higher. The
CurrencyShares Euro Trust , an exchange-traded fund listed
on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was up 0.9 percent at
$136.28. The ETF holds euro on-demand deposits in
euro-denominated bank accounts.
 The euro also benefited from buying against the Aussie
dollar, traders said, after a Chinese rate increase on Tuesday.
It had fallen significantly versus the Australian currency the
last two years.
 China's central bank raised its benchmark one-year deposit
rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent, its second increase in
just over a month, intensifying its fight against stubbornly
high inflation. For details, see [ID:nTOE706030]
 The Aussie dollar is the currency most sensitive to Chinese
interest rate policy as Australia is China's biggest supplier
of commodities.
 The decline in implied volatility, a measure of risk
sentiment in major currencies, has also spurred buying of
riskier currencies. The one-month implied volatility on
euro/dollar fell to its lowest in more than five months on
Tuesday, at 10.59 percent .
 Risky trades thrive in an environment of low volatility.
 The Australian dollar  initially fell against the
U.S. dollar after the Chinese rate hike but recovered in New
York trading to move up 0.3 percent at US$1.0159. Near-term
support is seen at $1.0083, last Friday's low.
 MacNeil Curry, chief rates & currencies technical
strategist, said in a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report
thst since 2000, the AUD/USD shows a very strong propensity to
rally at the start of the Lunar New Year.
 ""A break of 1.0185/1.0260 would confirm a return to trend,
targeting 1.06/1.10,"" he said. ""Given our bearish EUR view,
this should also result in a weaker EUR/AUD, with the current
bounce an opportunity to get short.""

 By Ingrid Melander and Harry Papachristou
 ATHENS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude
Juncker said on Tuesday he was open to a Greek debt buyback and
a 30-year extension to the repayment of the country's bailout
loans if Germany would consider it.
 Juncker applauded Greek fiscal efforts and said he was sure
debt-ridden Greece and the euro zone would survive the debt
crisis, triggered at the end of 2009, when Greece revealed its
finances were in a much worse state than previously thought.
 In an effort to reduce Greece's debt burden as early as the
second half of this year, EU and German officials are
considering steps such as a debt buyback, sources said last
week.
 ""That's an idea, a suggestion worth being followed but I
have to discuss this with my colleagues at the Eurogroup,"" he
told Reuters during a visit to Athens.
 He said that if the German government was willing to
consider a 30-year extension to the repayment of Greece's 110
billion euro bailout loans, he would not oppose it.
 He added that he did not think joint eurobonds would be
adopted in the near future.
 ""The euro will survive and Greece will be among the
survivors,"" Juncker told reporters, adding that Athens was
taking the right austerity measures and could count on the
solidarity of its partners.
 Juncker also said the euro itself was not in crisis.
 Euro zone leaders aim to agree in March on a comprehensive
package to draw a line under the bloc's debt crisis.
 Tensions over what measures the euro zone needs to take to
exit the debt crisis emerged at a summit last week after
Germany, backed by France, proposed a competitiveness pact that
includes locked debt limits and increased retirement ages.
 Juncker said the two countries must detail their proposal,
which and has irked a number of their partners. ""It is a baby
you cannot love before it is born,"" he said.
 The cost of protecting Greek and other euro zone peripheral
debt against default rose on Tuesday, with some analysts saying
dissent over the competitiveness pact dampened expectations of
strong measures to tackle the debt crisis.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told the same news
conference that euro zone leaders should take decisions in
March, without delay.
 ""We are on the right path but as it was clear from the
beginning, Europe has to take the necessary decisions as there
were shortages in the euro zone's economic governance,"" he said.

 WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. government's energy
forecaster on Tuesday revised up its estimate for global oil
demand this year, but also said more crude from major non-OPEC
oil producing countries will help meet higher consumption.
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration also said top
oil exporter and de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pumped about
100,000 barrels per day more crude than earlier estimated
during November and December due to higher power usage.
 At 8.6 million bpd, the EIA's estimate of Saudi production
was in line with last month's forecast from the Paris-based
International Energy Agency, which said that the kingdom had
quietly raised production to help cool oil prices.
 Saudi customers and some analysts say they haven't seen the
same rise in shipments, spurring a debate over whether or not
the Kingdom is opening the taps in order to put a damper on oil
prices that have topped $100 a barrel for the first time since
2008. It may be that the extra oil is being kept at home.
 ""Industry analysts have noticed an increase in Saudi
Arabia's direct burn of crude oil for power generation,"" said
Erik Kreil, an EIA analyst.
 Saudi Arabia often burns crude oil or residual fuel to
generate power in order to meet growing domestic electricity
demand, although such usage normally peaks during the hotter
summer months when air conditioning use peaks.
 ""This really has been the unsung story of global oil
demand. We have seen Mideast demand rise over recent years but
it has been overshadowed by growth in the emerging markets,""
said Phil Flynn, energy analyst at PFG Best in Chicago.
 The IEA, which advises the United States and 27 other
industrialized countries on energy policy, releases its new
monthly energy forecast on Thursday. OPEC does as well.
 HIGHER DEMAND BASELINE, GREATER NON-OPEC OIL
 Additional supply will be needed as the EIA said the world
will consume about 140,000 bpd more oil than it had forecast
just last month due to a higher 2009 baseline, with demand now
expected at a record 88.16 million bpd. The agency made only a

 * Citi called the 2007 audit ""hostile"" and ""intrusive""
 * Citi said China sought ""knowledge transfer""
 By Susan Cornwell
 WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - China used its regulatory
powers to scour the books of Citibank Shanghai in a ""hostile""
and ""extraordinarily intrusive"" 2007 audit that appeared
primarily aimed at controlling Citi's growth and uncovering its
secrets to success, the bank's top China executive at the time
told U.S. officials.
 The charges were contained in the cache of 250,000 U.S.
diplomatic cables obtained by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks
that Reuters has reviewed.
 The Citi case underscores the high level of scrutiny that
foreign companies face in China, particularly in the financial
sector, and it provides a window into complaints from U.S.
companies and trade negotiators that China conducts
intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.
 The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) sent 40
auditors into Citi in 2007 and ""wants to know how Citi works so
that the CBRC can control us due to their fear that Citi will
become too strong,"" the bank's then country head Richard
Stanley was quoted as saying in a classified cable from the
U.S. Shanghai consulate.
 There was ""knowledge transfer"" happening as a result of the
audit, according to Stanley in the Dec. 11, 2007, cable.
 While visits by government officials to foreign-owned
businesses in China are fairly common, the kind of office sweep
of a large Western corporation that Stanley describes is a
rarity.
 China keeps a tight grip on foreign investment in its
financial sector, using capital controls to stem outside money
entering the country and strictly limiting the amount a foreign
company can invest in a finance-related domestic firm. Getting
regulatory approval for such investments can take at least a
year.
 Citigroup Inc.  is one of the largest foreign lenders
in China, with a presence dating back to 1902. It now has about
34 consumer banking outlets there stretching across the
country. It was one of the first foreign lenders in 2007 to
incorporate locally, a move that allowed Chinese regulators to
scrutinize its books so thoroughly.
 Stanley, a U.S. citizen who has since died, was both Chief
Executive Officer of Citi China and Chairman of Citibank
(China) Co., Ltd, the locally-incorporated subsidiary.
 Just six months after Citi launched the subsidiary, Chinese
regulators sent 40 auditors into Citi's Shanghai headquarters
for a month, Stanley was quoted as saying in the 2007 cable.
 Stanley discussed the Chinese audit in two separate
meetings with the then-U.S. special envoy at Treasury for
China, Alan Holmer, as well as Federal Reserve System Governor
Kevin Warsh in November, 2007, the U.S. cable said. Officials
from the Shanghai consulate and Beijing embassy were also
present, it said.
 The U.S. State Department declined to comment on any
classified cable, its spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
 A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment directly on
the 2007 events described in the cable but said the bank had
good ties with Chinese regulators.
 ""Although we are unable to respond directly to these dated
and second-hand comments attributed to a deceased Citi
executive, the alleged statements in no way reflect Citigroup's
view of its regulatory relationships in China. We have a
constructive relationship with our regulators in China,"" the
spokeswoman said.
 ""LOOK"" CHINESE
 In the cable, Stanley is quoted as saying he felt the audit
was motivated more from an attempt to see how Citi works than
to see if Citi was doing anything improper.
 Also, it said Stanley believed the Chinese regulator was
""deadly serious"" about checking Citibank (China)'s independence
from international Citi business and making it look and act
more like a Chinese bank.
 A recurring question asked by the Chinese auditors was:
""Why don't you have more Chinese people on your bank board?""
Stanley told the Americans.
 He saw the audit as a sign that the Chinese were feeling
more nationalistic and confident. Chinese officials were
becoming ""strident and arrogant,"" and Stanley got the message
from them that Chinese banks were not ready to have significant
foreign bank participation, the cable said.
 ""We are not in an opening-up period"" in terms of China's
financial sector, Stanley told U.S. officials in the 2007
meetings. He implied things had been better from 1998-2003,
saying, ""I'm waiting for the second coming of Zhu Rongji,""
China's former premier.
 The current premier, Wen Jiabao, had a ""muddled approach,""
Stanley was quoted as saying.
 But Stanley saw hope in what was then a recent decision to
appoint the former Shanghai Communist Party Secretary Xi
Jinping to the Politburo, the cable said. Stanley said Xi was a
""very impressive person"" with a pro-business background.
 Xi, now China's vice president, is the presumed successor
to China's President Hu Jintao in an arranged power handover
that begins in late 2012.
 The cable was sent to officials in the U.S. State and
Treasury Departments as well as the National Security Council.
 Stanley left Citi in 2008 to become CEO of DBS Group
, Southeast Asia's biggest lender. He died of
complications from leukemia in 2009.

 NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - World stocks managed to claw
their way slightly higher while oil and other commodities
prices fell in volatile trade on Tuesday after China raised
interest rates for the second time in six weeks, spurring
worries that global growth will be crimped.
 In an intensifying bid to tame high inflation, China said
it would raise its benchmark one-year deposit rate by 25 basis
points to 3 percent.
 China is the world's biggest consumer of copper, an
industrial metal often viewed as a barometer for economic
conditions, and the world's second biggest consumer of energy.
 The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar fell on concerns
that Australia's economic growth and demand for commodities
could suffer.
 The euro rallied broadly on demand from Asian central
banks, while the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc fell across the
board as investors ventured away from safe-haven currencies
after tensions in Egypt eased.
 Global stocks coasted, with major averages lingering near
2-1/2-year highs. In the United States, equities rose as gains
in consumer discretionary stocks offset losses in energy
shares.
 ""China is weighing on commodity prices and commodity
stocks, but it's not weighing so much on the entire market,""
said Randall Warren, president at Warren Financial Service in
Philadelphia. ""We need a breather at this point for a healthier

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and Swiss franc
fell across the board on Tuesday, with more losses seen likely,
as investors ventured away from safe-haven currencies after
tensions in Egypt eased.
 The euro, on the other hand, recovered broadly, lifted by
demand from Asian central banks and buying against the
Australian dollar after a Chinese interest rate hike fueled
concerns over that country's economic growth and demand for
commodities.
 Analysts, however, said the euro's rally against the dollar
could be short-lived as comments from European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet last week had damped down
expectations of a near-term ECB rate hike.
 The euro rose above key resistance at $1.3680, a high on
electronic trading platform EBS last Friday. If euro/dollar
manages to extend beyond $1.3680, analysts see the next
resistance level at $1.3767, the Feb. 2 low.
 ""It's all about risk. Euro/Swiss is up big. The market is
happily unwinding some of the safe-haven positions taken during
the Egypt crisis,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency
strategist at OANDA in Toronto.
 ""Egyptian headlines are not on the front pages any more and
that's certainly supporting risk appetite. This has weighed on
historical safe-haven currencies such as the dollar and Swiss
franc.""
 Traders said the dollar and Swiss franc could fall further
given a sizable amount of safe-haven buying the last 10 days.
 In midday trading, the U.S. dollar struggled against a
major currency basket, falling 0.4 percent to 77.693, and lost
ground against the yen to 81.92 yen.
 Traders said central bank buying of yen and fiscal year-end
repatriation in Japan have supported the Japanese currency
against the dollar despite a surge in U.S. yields in recent
weeks.
 The euro gained 0.6 percent versus the greenback to $1.3675
as investors booked profits on long dollar positions taken in
the last four days.
 Other euro-linked assets were also higher. The
CurrencyShares Euro Trust, an exchange-traded fund listed on
the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was up 0.9 percent at
$136.28 on Tuesday. The ETF holds euro on-demand deposits in
euro-denominated bank accounts.
 The euro zone single currency also benefited from buying
against the Aussie dollar, traders said, after a Chinese rate
increase on Tuesday, having fallen significantly versus the
Australian currency the last two years.
 China's central bank raised its benchmark one-year deposit
rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent, its second increase in
just over a month, intensifying its fight against stubbornly
high inflation.
 The euro fell 18.2 percent versus the Aussie dollar last
year and dropped 19.1 percent in 2009. It has risen 2.8 percent
so far this year and clearly has room for further gains. On
Tuesday the euro was up 0.3 percent to A$1.3439.
 The Aussie dollar is the currency most sensitive to Chinese
interest rate policy as Australia is China's biggest supplier
of commodities.
 The negative impact of the Chinese rate rise on commodity
currencies has all but faded as risk appetite increased.
 The decline in implied volatility, a measure of risk
sentiment in major currencies, has also spurred buying of
riskier currencies. The one-month implied volatility on
euro/dollar fell to its lowest in more than five months on
Tuesday, at 10.59 percent.
 Risky trades thrive in an environment of low volatility.
 The Australian dollar initially fell against the U.S.
dollar after the Chinese rate hike but recovered in New York
trading to move up 0.4 percent at US$1.0175. Near-term support
is seen at $1.0083, last Friday's low.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2011 12:08PM ET</span>",PREVIEW-Euro zone finmins to discuss rescue fund changes Monday," * Eurogroup to make progress on EFSF, no final decisions
 * EFSF interventions on primary bond market seen possible
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers will
discuss how to give their rescue fund more firepower and how to
tackle new crises at a meeting on Monday, but final decisions
are unlikely before March, euro zone sources said.
 Finance ministers from the 17 countries that use the euro
and the President of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude
Trichet meet on Feb 14 in Brussels to try to make progress on a
new, comprehensive response to the sovereign debt crisis.
 The package is to include changes to the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro bailout fund
created last May, to increase its lending capacity and give it
more flexibility on how to use its money. Strengthening the
EFSF has been the focus of discussion for months, since it
became clear its effective capacity was only about 250 billion
euros, not 440 billion, due to guarantees built into the fund to
maintain its triple-A credit rating. 
 ""We will have that discussion -- the increase of the lending
capacity of the EFSF and broadening its mandate,"" a euro zone
source involved in the preparations for the meeting said.
 ""This is a discussion that at a preparatory level is going
reasonably well but there are a number of political questions
related to that -- in some countries, changes to the EFSF will
require parliamentary approval,"" the source said.
 Germany and France want talks on changes to the EFSF to be
linked to boosting euro zone competitiveness through higher
retirement ages, national laws to cap debt, a common corporate
tax base and an end to wage indexing to inflation.
 But this initiative met almost immediate resistance from a
wide range of euro zone member states from Belgium to Austria,
Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Poland and Luxembourg and a discussion
of the Franco-German proposal was not formally on Monday's
agenda.
 ""Since this is part of the comprehensive package, even if
there is agreement (on some aspects of changes to the EFSF) it
will not mean there is a decision, because nothing is decided
until everything is decided,"" the source said.
 ""There could be agreement on a certain number of elements,
but not a decision per se.""
 The source said that while there was agreement that the EFSF
effective lending capacity should be boosted to the full 440
billion euros, there was no consensus yet on how to do that.
 
 BOOSTING THE FUND
 One of the ideas, favoured by Germany, is that countries
with a triple A credit rating would increase their guarantees
for the fund, while those below triple-A would inject cash.
 But the source said such a solution could be divisive.
 ""I would not exclude anything at this point, but I would
think that anything that introduces a wedge between triple-A and
non-triple-A countries is unlikely to occur -- it's about equal
treatment,"" the source said.
 The EFSF now steps in as the lender of last resort to euro
zone countries cut off from markets. The ministers will discuss
various ways of giving the EFSF more operational flexibility.
 ""I think interventions of the EFSF on the primary market
could possibly happen,"" the euro zone source said. 
 A second euro zone source noted, however, that bond
purchases on both primary and secondary markets were seen by
some countries as going against the no-bailout clause in EU law.
 On the possibility of the EFSF making bond purchases on the
secondary market, an option favoured by the European Central
Bank which is conducting such operations now, the first euro
zone source said: ""I think it is less and less likely.""
 Sources said the option of using EFSF money for buy-backs of
distressed debt were also under consideration. 
 But a deal that would finalise the instruments available in
the toolbox of the revamped EFSF might only be reached once the
whole package of measures is agreed on by EU leaders at a summit
on March 24-25, sources said.
 A flexible credit line, modelled on an instrument from the
International Monetary Fund, could be used in the European
Stability Mechanism that is to replace the EFSF from mid-2013. 
 ""For the ESM -- yes. For the EFSF -- I don't think so,"" the
first source said. 
 Euro zone governments are also likely to extend the maturity
of bilateral loans to Greece from three to seven years, the first
source said, adding the proposal of German central bank governor
Axel Weber to extend them to 30 years was not discussed.
 The ministers will also choose between Belgium's Peter Praet
and Slovakia's Elena Kohutikova as the person to replace
Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell on the ECB's executive board.

 NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - World stocks and oil prices
ebbed from recent highs on Tuesday after China raised interest
rates for the second time in just over a month, spurring
worries of the hike's impact on global economic demand.
 The euro recovered, lifted by demand from Asian central
banks and pressure on the commodity-sensitive Australian
dollar.
 The rate hike also fueled concerns over Chinese demand for
commodities, sending copper and tin prices lower. Spot gold
prices , however, rose $16.05, or 1.19 percent, to
$1364.80.
 China's central bank raised its benchmark one-year deposit
rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent on Tuesday. For details,

 NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Tuesday,
lifted by demand from Asian central banks and buying against
the Australian dollar after a Chinese interest rate hike fueled
concerns over its growth and demand for commodities.
 Analysts, however, said the euro's rally could be
short-lived after comments from European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet last week dampened expectations of a
near-term rate hike. Traders said as long as the euro trades
below $1.3680, a high on electronic trading platform EBS last
Friday, the single currency should trade with a weak bias.
 If the euro/dollar manages to extend beyond $1.3680,
analysts see the next resistance level at $1.3767, the Feb. 2
low.
 ""There's been a lot of talk of Asian central banks having
bought a significant amount of U.S. dollars as intervention to
weaken their currencies, and that shows as reserves flow back
into euros,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency
strategist at Westpac in New York.
 ""But if you look at the euro, it has broken down ever since
we had the less hawkish Trichet last week.""
 The euro gained 0.3 percent versus the greenback to $1.3627
as investors booked profits on long dollar positions taken in
the last four days.
 Gains in the euro were muted after a weaker-than-expected
reading of German industrial output for December on Tuesday.
That followed a dismal industrial orders report the previous
day, leading to a selloff in the common currency and a two-week
low of $1.3508.
 The single euro zone currency also benefited from buying
against the Aussie dollar, traders said, after the Chinese rate
move, analysts said, having fallen significantly versus the
Australian currency the last two years.
 The euro fell 18.2 percent versus the Aussie dollar last
year and dropped 19.1 percent in 2009. It has risen 2.8 percent
so far this year. But it clearly has room for further gains,
and on Tuesday the euro was up 0.4 percent to A$1.3449.
 The Aussie dollar is the currency most sensitive to Chinese
interest rate policy as Australia is China's biggest supplier
of commodities.
 China's central bank raised its benchmark one-year deposit
rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent on Tuesday, its second
increase in just over a month, intensifying its fight against
stubbornly high inflation.
 ""Tighter monetary policy suggests weaker growth, and this
plays negatively for commodities,"" said Paul Robson, strategist
at RBS.
 ""Australia relies heavily on bulk commodities, so a slowing
Chinese economy would take the edge off that at a time when
markets are looking at deteriorating short-term economic data
in Australia due to the floods the country has been dealing
with.""
 The Australian dollar initially fell against the U.S.
dollar after the Chinese news, but recovered early in New York
trading to move up 0.2 percent at US$1.0149. Near-term support
is seen at $1.0083, last Friday's low.
 The U.S. dollar struggled across the board, falling 0.2
percent against a currency basket, and lost ground against the
yen to 82.19 yen.

dispute between India and Iran over oil payments raises new
questions as India seeks to use a European bank that is subject
to U.S. sanctions to facilitate the $12 billion-a-year trade.
 The two countries have been negotiating a new payment scheme
after India's central bank said a long-standing clearing
mechanism could no longer be used, jeopardising Iran's 400,000
barrels per day (bpd) of exports, which cover 12 percent of
India's oil needs.
 The United States has not commented on the new proposal.
Washington welcomed the Reserve Bank of India's initial move,
which came just weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama visited
India, which aspires to a permanent seat on the U.N. Security
Council.
 Iran is second only to Saudi Arabia as an oil supplier to
India, while India is Iran's second-biggest crude buyer after
China, accounting for about 20 percent of its exports.
 Following are some key questions on the issue:
 
 WHAT IS THE PROPOSED NEW MECHANISM?
 An Indian oil ministry source said last week payments would
be handled by State Bank of India (SBI) and Tehran-owned
European-Iranian Trade Bank (EIH), which is already under U.S.
sanctions applying to transactions with Iranian banks seen to be
aiding Iran's nuclear programme.
 Transactions will be vetted by New Delhi to try to ensure
funds are not being used to boost Iran's nuclear programme, the
source added. Payments will be in euros and for individual
deals, instead of a net trade balance being settled every two
months.
 But the SBI has not yet got the go-ahead from government
authorities to handle the payments, sources at the bank say.
 Iran and India could consider a bilateral trade arrangement
if the current proposal does not work, said Iran's ambassador to
India, Seyed Mahdi Nabizadeh.
 But finance ministry sources are sceptical that such a move
could materialise, because a bilateral agreement could expose
the Indian government to U.S. criticism.
 
 WHY THE DELAY?
 SBI needs a green light from the Reserve Bank of India,
which in turn must get a full government go-ahead.
 The oil ministry and the finance ministry are keen to get
payments going again, but India will not want to risk going out
on a diplomatic limb as it craves international support in the
region, where volatile Pakistan and Afghanistan are its
neighbours.
 India's foreign ministry has yet to give its approval to the
new mechanism, which could anger the United States because it
uses EIH.
 German banking regulator Bafin has declined to comment, but
a spokesman said the watchdog would act to check compliance of
banks with obligations under the country's trade laws.
 Germany's economics ministry, responsibile for embargoes or
other restrictions under the country's law, has yet to comment.
 
 WHAT'S AT STAKE?
 India's state-owned refiners, Mangalore Refinery and
Petrochemicals Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum and Indian Oil Corp,
along with privately owned Essar Oil, would have to find
alternative sources for supplies.
 Iran's largely high-sulphur content crude is difficult to
refine and produces a higher percentage of diesel, which is used
widely in India's agriculture sector for machinery and water
pumping.
 Iran's oil deals with India run for a year until March 31,
2011 and so far it has said it will continue supplies.
 India's state-owned refiners could replace missing barrels
with crude from Africa, where there are similar quality crudes
and freight rates are not too prohibitive. Private refiner Essar
has said it would step up imports from Latin America.
 India is looking to lock in more diverse supplies to meet
its growing local demand and fulfil requirements for expanding
refineries. It has already sought additional crude from two key
African producers -- Angola and Nigeria.
 Iran would have to find alternative buyers for 20 percent of
its crude exports, but with oil prices over $100 a barrel there
should be little difficulty selling extra barrels.
 The issue highlights the problems faced by refiners in doing
business with sanctions-hit Iran and could raise concerns among
them over the sustainability of crude supplies.
 
 WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON INDIA'S FINANCES?
 There is a backlog of $2 billion in payments waiting to be
settled, the oil ministry source said last week.
 India's oil import bill fell 16 percent in December to $6.9
billion despite scorching international prices, which pushed the
April-to-December bill up by 18 percent. Traders say the
December fall could be linked to the lack of payments to Iran.
 India's coalition government is currently trying to rein in
inflation, which is being pumped partly by a nearly 12 percent
rise in fuel prices after petrol was deregulated last June.
 India caps diesel prices and the cost of this is split
between the government, state-owned oil majors, refiners and
consumers. It has offered a subsidy of $4.63 billion so far in
the current fiscal year -- well above the $686 million for fuel
subsidies in the budget.

 * Ethiopia hopes to join WTO soon
 * Poor country with potentially large market
 
 By Aaron Maasho
 ADDIS ABABA, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Ethiopia said on Tuesday it
expected to gain entry to the World Trade Organisation soon
without giving way to foreign demands that it open up its
banking and telecoms sectors.
 Analysts say the Horn of Africa country's hopes for WTO
membership hinge on calls for Addis Ababa to open those areas to
international competition, in a country where most people have
no telephone or bank accounts.
 U.S. officials have publicly asked Ethiopia to liberalise
both sectors, seen as a stumbling block to Ethiopia's efforts
for accession to the WTO since 2003 -- which could help boost
investor confidence, enticing foreign cash and know-how.
 The country of 80 million people is among the world's
poorest and one of its largest recipients of foreign aid. It is
scheduled to hold its second working party meetings, a major
foundation for prospective membership in May.
 But Ethiopia is attracting growing interest from foreign
investors in agriculture, hydropower, and oil and gas
exploration, and has recorded growth of more than 10 percent for
the last five years.
 ""WTO membership obviously has its benefits, but we believe
surrendering our sensitive areas such as banking and
telecommunications will harm our national interests,"" State
Minister for Trade Yacob Yalla told Reuters.
 ""We are confident that our accession will be finalised soon,
and we expect them to respect our sensitivities in that
process,"" he said.
 Speaking at a workshop organised to share experience with
Cambodia and Yemen, Yacob lamented the ""cumbersome and
time-consuming"" process for accession, and said his country
seeks to move directly towards bilateral negotiations after May.
 Bids to join the WTO take anywhere between three to 15
years, according to the organisation, and some countries such as
Yemen have held up to eight working party meetings before
proceeding to bilateral discussions with trade partners.
 Ethiopia has suffered high inflation, power cuts and a
shortage of foreign currency in recent years.
 Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a former Marxist rebel, said in
2009 that he hoped negotiations would be finished within three
years and said competition may be inevitable.
 Meles has said Ethiopia may not need any food aid within
five years thanks to an ambitious development plan that targets
an average economic growth of 14.9 percent over the period.
 Addis Ababa has posted high economic growth figures over the
past five years, averaging about 11 percent, according to
government figures. Opposition parties have disputed the
accuracy of the country's growth statistics.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell on
Tuesday after a surprise Chinese interest rate rise spurred
speculation growth in the world's No. 2 economy may slow, while
the euro rose against the dollar, boosted by Asian demand.
 Other major currencies were little affected after China's
central bank raised its benchmark one-year deposit rate by 25
basis points to 3 percent. The hike was its second increase in
just over a month as policymakers step up their fight against
stubbornly high inflation. [ID:nBJA002446]
 While investors have been anticipating a gradual tightening
in Chinese monetary policy, analysts said riskier currencies
including the commodity-driven Australian dollar would be most
vulnerable to such moves.
 ""Tighter monetary policy suggests weaker growth, and this
plays negatively for commodities,"" said Paul Robson, strategist
at RBS.
 ""Australia relies heavily on bulk commodities, so a slowing
Chinese economy would take the edge off that at a time when
markets are looking at deteriorating short-term economic data in
Australia due to the floods the country has been dealing with.""
 The Australian dollar  fell more than half a U.S.
cent after Beijing's announcement to around $1.0120, shedding
earlier gains to trade weaker on the day. Near term support is
seen at $1.0083, last Friday's low.
 The euro  also dipped on the China rate hike news, but
quickly recovered to trade 0.5 percent higher at $1.3648.
Traders said Asian investors, including sovereign names, bought
the euro as players in the region have been selling the dollar
since returning on Monday after the lunar new year holidays.
 But gains were muted after much weaker-than-expected German
industrial output for December. That followed a dismal
industrial orders survey the previous day which had led to a
sell-off in the common currency and saw it drop to a two-week
low of $1.3508.
 The dollar struggled across the board, falling 0.3 percent
against its currency basket <.DXY>, while shedding ground
against the yen  to 82.17.

 EURO CONCERNS
 Traders are reluctant to buy the dollar aggressively, after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week that the
U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help -- a stance he is
expected to repeat when he speaks on Wednesday.
 Still, the dollar is likely to be supported on the back of a
spike in U.S. yields. The 10-year U.S. yield  hit a
nine-month high of around 3.7 percent on Monday, and money
markets have started to price in a chance of a U.S. rate hike
later this year.
 While the euro recovered on Tuesday, it remains well below a
12-week high of $1.3862 hit last week, and analysts say the
single currency will struggle to pick up its rally after
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet last week
doused expectations for an imminent interest rate rise.
 ECB Governing Council member Yves Mersch argued on Monday
the central bank could raise rates before it ended measures to
support liquidity, but analysts say the euro zone economy is too
weak to withstand a rate rise in the near term. [ID:nLDE71628Y]
 Some said the single currency may stumble if European
leaders are unable to agree next month on a plan to strengthen
the bloc's economy and its debt rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility.
 ""Peripheral risks should continue to haunt euro as well,""
said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi. ""The
upcoming elections in Ireland and Germany have already prompted
comments by various politicians which could point at potential
turbulent times for euro in the weeks ahead.""

 * Says EU must do more than just consolidate debt

(Adds quotes, background, details)
 ROME, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The European Union's bailout fund
should be strengthened and its mandate expanded to allow it to
buy bonds on the market and finance troubled banks directly, a
senior Bank of Italy official said on Tuesday.
 Fabrizio Saccomanni, deputy head of the Italian central
bank, said that many financial analysts had expressed doubts
over whether the European Financial Stability Facility had
sufficient ""firepower"" if the financial crisis spread to big
economies like Spain or Italy.
 ""I consider this scenario highly improbable but I think it
would be appropriate to increase the effective dimension of the
EFSF, which is considerably smaller than its nominal scale, and
above all its operational potential,"" he said, according to the
text of a speech given at the German finance ministry in Berlin.
 ""Beyond loans to states, the EFSF should be able to finance
banks and purchase government bonds on the market,"" he said.
 At a summit meeting last week, European Union leaders backed
the idea of boosting the effective capacity of the fund and
making it more flexible but details have still to be worked out
ahead of a meeting in late March to agree the changes.
 Germany, the fund's main paymaster, has presented proposals
for a ""competitiveness pact"" including fixed debt limits and
higher retirement ages that it wants to see agreed before the
EFSF can be reinforced.
The Italian government has not yet made a clear public
statement of its position on the pact but officials have
expressed concern over the strict emphasis on debt control in
the German proposals.
 They say successive Italian governments have made serious
efforts to rein in the debt and note that Italy's relatively
modest deficit, high rate of private savings and conservative
banking system have shielded it from the financial crisis.
 Saccomanni, who does not speak for the government, said
Italy, with a public debt ratio of around 119 percent of gross
domestic product, was well aware of its obligation to repair its
finances.
 ""But it is equally obvious that countries which share a
currency have the moral obligation to cooperate to facilitate
the correction of imbalances and to prevent contagion spreading
across the whole area and destabilising the single currency
itself,"" he said.
 He said Europe needed to have clear proposals to strengthen
economic government but he added that ""the EU cannot resolve its
structural problems solely through fiscal consolidation.""
 Reforms to boost competitiveness and growth, one of Italy's
chronic weak points, were needed, he said.

 By Christiaan Hetzner 
 BERLIN, Feb 8 (Reuters) - German industrial output fell
unexpectedly in December as the worst winter weather in years
triggered a collapse in construction but the data failed to
dampen growth expectations for Europe's biggest economy.
 Forward-looking business and sentiment surveys have climbed
to multi-year highs, suggesting buoyant exports are driving
growth across the German economy and fanning hopes that spending
by its consumers could help lift the wider euro zone.
[ID:nLDE70K0L2] [ID:nSLALCE7ND]
 ""Under the blanket of snow, there still slumbers a lot of
growth potential,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.
 ""With high backlogs, record high production expectations and
improving investment plans, all the ingredients are there to
continue the success story of the last two years.""
 France, Germany's biggest single trading partner, is
expected to grow 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2010, its
fastest clip in seven years, the French central bank said on
Tuesday in a surprisingly upbeat forecast. [ID:nLDE7170H8]
 Germany's economy ministry said December industrial output
had sunk by 1.5 percent on the month in seasonally adjusted
terms, well below the 0.3 percent increase forecast in a Reuters
poll and putting pressure on the euro. [ID:nLDE71711X]
 Construction activity fell by nearly a quarter, the biggest
monthly drop since records began in 2000.
 The ministry said the fall in production had been strongly
influenced by December's Arctic weather conditions.
 ""The economically important manufacturing sector is still
pointing towards an upwards trend, however, and retained in the
final quarter of the year its growth rate from the previous
period (the third quarter),"" it said in a statement.

 Separately, employers from the mechanical and electrical
engineering sectors said on Tuesday they expect to increase
production and create jobs in the early months of this year, in
a statement released by their association Gesamtmetall.
 ""In all likelihood, we will have fully recovered from the
global economic crisis by the end of 2011,"" said Gesamtmetall
economist Michael Stahl.

 GROWTH POTENTIAL
 A statistician at the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said December's plunge in building activity was the worst since
German reunification in 1990.
 Construction activity accounts for only about 4 percent of
gross domestic product, whereas manufacturers like Siemens
, BASF  and Volkswagen  make up
roughly a quarter of Germany's economy.
 Taking November into account to smooth out volatility,
overall industry output including construction was flat in the
last two months of 2010 versus the combined September-October
period, suggesting fourth quarter growth was driven largely by
the services sector.
 Other data on Monday showed traditionally volatile industry
orders slid far more than expected in Germany in December,
giving back much of November's gains, but leaving a sizeable
backlog of orders booked to fuel future output. [ID:nLDE7160ZR]
 Detailed German GDP figures are due on Feb. 24, with first
estimates for the final quarter showing growth of only 0.5
percent due to the harsh weather.

blip
* Hungary growth in govt's focus, f'casts unchanged for now
* Slovakia output beats forecasts, Romania slightly lower
By Marton Dunai and Sandor Peto
BUDAPEST, Feb 7 (Reuters) - A sudden drop in export demand
hammered Hungarian industry in December, leading to an 11.8
percent drop in output on the month and a much smaller rise from
the same month a year earlier than analysts had forecast.
 The drop in production in the emerging European Union nation
of 10 million contrasted starkly with its regional peers, where
output continued to surge despite a bigger-than-forecast fall in
orders in Germany, their biggest export market.
 Hungarian output rose just 8.5 percent versus a year
earlier, data showed on Tuesday, slowing from a 14.7 percent
rise in November and far undershooting analysts' median forecast
for a 17.1 percent rise.
 The monthly drop-off in Hungary affected all industry
sectors and was largely due to a decline in demand for the
country's exports, a statistician from the central statistics
office KSH said.
 Economists said Hungary's data was likely a one-off blip and
that they would not change their growth forecasts for now, but
it highlighted how the government's budget strategy depends on
optimistic growth forecasts.
 ""We were somewhat surprised, taking into account strong PMI
figures and the rest of the region doing well in manufacturing,""
Danske Bank analyst Lars Christensen said.
 ""We're not panicking over these numbers. I am inclined to
say this is a one-off. On the domestic side things are fragile
but exports have been good, so we have a hard time seeing why
this figure should be so low.""
 German industry output fell unexpectedly in December,
depressed by a weather-related plunge in construction activity,
the Economy Ministry said later on Tuesday. Output sank by 1.5
percent on the month in seasonally adjusted terms, while
economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting a 0.3 percent
rise in output.
 The Hungarian forint was little changed against the euro, as
was the Polish zloty and the Romanian leu.
 
 HUNGARY LAGS
 Some analysts said the drop could potentially be attributed
to severe weather in Germany, which may have caused some
manufacturers there to close temporarily.
 ""December brought very harsh weather in Germany, as in many
other places in Europe, so I suspect some German companies
scaled back production, leading to a dropoff,"" said Dirk Wolfer,
spokesman for the German-Hungarian Chamber of Commerce.
 But that did not explain the strong performance in some of
Hungary's neighbours. Slovak output rode a rise in car exports
to beat analyst forecasts, expanding 19.7 percent from the same
period a year earlier even though some other industry sectors
recorded somewhat slower growth than in the preceding month.
 That even outpaced strong data from the Czech Republic,
where output grew 12.7 percent on the year. Slovakia also
outperformed every other country in the region, with Polish
slipping 4.1 percent in December from the previous month and
Romania recording a dip of 0.2 percent.
 ""We expect industrial output to maintain double-digit growth
in the first quarter,"" Eduard Hagara, senior analyst with ING
Bank in Bratislava said.
 After prematurely ending a bailout deal with the EU and
International Monetary Fund, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
Orban has shunned austerity measures in favour of a pro-growth
strategy incorporating a raft of unconventional budget measures.
 Aside from seizing some $14 billion in private pension
assets and taxing banks, utilities and other mainly foreign
firms to cover public spending and cut debt, the plan depends on
growth forecasts of 3 percent this year, accelerating to 5.5
percent by 2015, which analysts say may be over-optimistic.
 And although economists refused to draw wider conclusions
from the December industry data or use it as a reason to change
their growth forecasts, they said that any longer-term slowdown
would raise risks to Orban's budget plans.
 ""It does serve to highlight the fragility of this kind of
pro-growth strategy,"" said Neil Shearing, an economist at
London-based Capital Economics.
 ""At the moment, everything has been driven by industry and
manufacturing, and any signs that that is starting to lose steam
would be a real worry because there is no real evidence yet of
the consumer sector starting to pick up.""

 * Workers get additional one-time payment of 1 percent
 * Analysts downplay fear of wage-price spiral
 
(Adds fresh textile workers demand, economist quote, details)
 By Jan Schwartz
 HANNOVER, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen and German unions
agreed to a substantial wage hike on Tuesday, adding to concerns
of policymakers already facing the prospect of above-target
inflation in the euro zone rising further.
 The 3.2 percent pay rise for around 100,000 workers raised
the prospect of other sectors gaining similar inflation-busting
increases this year, although economists said the effect on
European Central Bank thinking would not be dramatic.
 The deal, struck in the early morning hours after marathon
talks that started on Monday, also includes a one-time payment
of 1 percent of annual wages or at least 500 euros per person at
Europe's largest car maker and runs for 16 months from May 1.
 Union IG Metall had demanded a 6 percent wage increase, a
far cry from the average 1.8 percent increase seen country-wide
on average in 2010, according to data from the Hans Boeckler
Stiftung think-tank.
 ""The Volkswagen deal could raise concerns if it leads to a
trend, but we would have to first see second round effects, and
similar moves in other countries before the ECB moves on
interest rates,"" said Claudia Windt from Helaba.
 Euro zone inflation hit 2.4 percent in January, above the
ECB's target of close to but below 2.0 percent for the second
month running.
 In the same month, German inflation hit 2.0 percent.
 ECB policymakers say they expect inflation to subside
further out but have sharpened their warnings that interest
rates will rise if it does not.
 A wage-price spiral, where buoyant economic conditions and
rising prices push workers to secure higher pay, would be a major
concern for central bankers intent on controlling inflation.
 The latest Reuters poll of economists found a narrow
majority expecting a first ECB rate hike from a record low of
1.0 percent in the last quarter of the year.
 
 LITTLE INFLATION ALARM
 Germany is so dominant economically within the euro zone
that the ECB will be more attuned to signs of price pressures
there than anywhere else. But most analysts said the deal was
moderate enough to keep the central bank relatively sanguine.
 ""Overall, the 'headline settlement', while being higher than
the sector wide 2.7 percent headline pay increase in 2010,
appears to be a signal for ongoing wage moderation,"" said
Thorsten Polleit at Barclays Capital.
 Neither does the raise stand out compared to past deals at
the company: in the last agreement in Sept. 2009, Volkswagen and
IG Metall agreed to a 4.2 percent pay raise plus one-off
payments in western Germany.
 Sluggish growth and prices in Germany, where consumer prices
account for just over a quarter of the weighting for euro zone
inflation data, have generally offset rapid inflation in smaller
states such as Ireland and Spain. 
 Now, higher wage demands, loose monetary policy and rising
food and fuel prices may create the opposite situation.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 In a telling sign of union ambition for the year, IG Metall
said after the deal that it would demand a 5 percent raise for
some 110,000 textile workers who begin negotiations tomorrow.
The Hans Boeckler think tank says it expects demands to range
from 5 to 7 percent this year across sectors.
 The booming auto sector however stands out from other parts
of the German economy, such as the chemicals sector, where
less-impressive profits leave less money for pay increases.
 Volkswagen says it is growing significantly and expects a
""robust"" year while its luxury unit Audi saw double-digit growth
in January sales driven by significant demand in all regions.
 So busy is Volkswagen that it briefly shut down its assembly
line in Wolfsburg -- where it makes about 3,000 cars a day --
last month because its suppliers were unable to deliver parts
quickly enough to keep up with the pace of production.
 Volkswagen shares were up nearly 3.3 percent just before
market close on Monday.
 With the wage rise affecting a relatively small number of
workers, and with public sector workers asking for a more modest
3 percent pay rise small in their ongoing negotiations, the
chance of a wage-price spiral appeared slim to economists.
 ""For the ECB it is probably not a big concern for the time
being, particularly because unit labour costs are not likely to
increase as a result,"" said Juergen Michels at Citigroup.
 ""But it will increase the disposal income of German
households, and that's likely to support the outlook for
consumption in Germany,"" he said.
 The main impact of Tuesday's deal may not come until next
year, when the powerful, millions-strong engineering and
metalworkers sector negotiations for its next pay increase.
 ""They have no negotiations this year, but this gives insight
into what's coming next year -- it basically shows that
employees are demanding and securing their share of the economic
recovery,"" said Andreas Scheuerle from Dekabank.

(Adds trade data for 2010, economy minister)
 By Shrikesh Laxmidas and Sergio Goncalves
 SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Portugal
is pinning its growth hopes on a further rise in exports, its
prime minister said, looking to ease market concerns the
government's austerity programme could trigger another
recession.
 ""Exports is an area where we can fight for economic growth
in 2011 and compensate for the recessive effect that the budget
austerity measures inevitably have on the economy,"" Jose
Socrates told a congress of exporters on Tuesday.
 Exports soared by 15.7 percent last year, the National
Statistics Institute said, and Economy Minister Jose Vieira da
Silva said Portugal's foreign trade had bounced back fully from
a slump caused by the global financial crisis in 2009.
 According to the 2011 budget, the government expects exports
to grow 7.3 percent this year.
 Socrates said the government's priorities for 2011 were to
cut the budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product
from around 7 percent in 2010, as well as maintain economic
growth after last year's estimated 1.3 percent expansion.
 Slashing the deficit is vital to convincing investors
Portugal can solve its public finance and debt problems on its
own without seeking a bailout as Ireland and Greece did.
 But many economists expect Portugal to slide back into
recession this year as the tax hikes and public sector wage cuts
imposed by the government reduce consumption.
 ""In 2011 Portugal will make one of the deepest and most
ambitious budget adjustments ... needed to guarantee the
international credibility of our economy, guarantee financing of
our economy and its growth,"" Socrates said.
 Meanwhile, the government was contributing to export growth
by cutting red tape, promoting Portuguese goods abroad and
providing incentives and financing, he said, but stopped short
of announcing any concrete new measures.
 ""We want to show that the state is on the side of the
exporting companies, that the country understands that this is
the top priority,"" he said.
 The government is banking on continued export growth,
especially to new markets in fast-growing emerging economies, to
eke out GDP expansion of 0.2 percent this year.
 Analysts say exports surprised on the positive side last
year and should continue rising. However, they warn that export
diversification will take time to bear fruit, while Portugal's
main trading partner and neighbour Spain is itself implementing
tough austerity.
 Last year the economy grew an estimated 1.3 percent after
shrinking 2.6 percent the previous year, and any new recession
would make planned budget deficit cuts more difficult.
 Economy Minister Vieira da Silva said Portugal ""was one of
the countries that have recovered the fastest from the very
strong fall in exports at the peak of the recession in 2009.""
 He said the country has diversified the range of products it
sells abroad and the markets it sells to, though boosting
exports further presented a key challenge.
 ""It is ... probably the main structural challenge of our
economy,"" he said. 
 Despite its strong exports growth last year, Portugal's
trade deficit still widened about 2 percent, largely due to the
rising cost of oil and fuel imports.

 PARIS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - France will issue a new 15-year OAT
bond linked to euro zone inflation in the coming days, the debt
management agency said on Tuesday, tapping growing investor
demand for paper protected from inflation.
 Globally, investor interest in bonds that track the rate of
inflation has surged in recent weeks on concerns about the
outlook for inflation.
 ""When you have higher growth you have higher inflation and
so investors demand protection against potential upward
revisions of inflation and so we have strong appetite for linker
bonds which offer protection against that,"" Philippe Mills,
Chief Executive of the debt management agency AFT, said.
 Mills said the new OATei bond maturing July 25, 2027, could
go on sale as early as Wednesday depending on market conditions
and that the AFT was targeting an issue size of about 3 billion
euros.
 The euro zone's inflation rate hit 2.4 percent in January,
the highest since October 2008, and investors expect it to stick
at around 2.2 percent, according to the so-called breakeven rate
that measures market expectations of euro zone inflation based
on France's existing 10-year OATei bond. [ID:nLDE7091HX]
 
 INFLATION PROTECTION PIONEER
 France has been a pioneer of inflation-linked bonds in
continental Europe for years, with a first issue in 1998. The
liquidity of France's existing OAT bonds linked to euro zone
inflation has made them a European benchmark.
Its new bond will be issued in a syndication led by Barclays
Capital , BNP Paribas , Credit Agricole
, HSBC  and Royal Bank of Scotland  as
joint lead managers, the Agence France Tresor (AFT) said.
 ""The AFT's decision to now go ahead with that bond clearly
underpins the very constructive market environment for linkers
in general,"" Commerzbank interest rate strategist David Schnautz
said.
 France generally sells inflation-linked bonds to cover
roughly 10 percent of its total annual debt issuance.
 Last month, AFT issued nearly 3 billion euros of a new
five-year BTANi bond linked to French inflation, the first
five-year French linker, and attracted good demand from
investors.
 ""We are an issuer that wants to have a complete curve on any
segment of the market we are issuing in,"" Mills said. ""For us it
was obvious to have this specific point for the curve on euro
area inflation.""
 The AFT issued 20.4 billion euros of inflation-indexed bonds
last year out of a total gross issuance of BTAN and OAT bonds of
210.7 billion euros.

 LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - European stocks and oil prices
turned lower on Tuesday after China raised interest rates for
the second time in just over a month, intensifying its fight
against inflation.
 The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar also fell but
world stocks still held near the previous day's 29-month high as
China's monetary tightening did little to immediately change the
favourable outlook for global growth this year.
 Recent strong manufacturing and services sector surveys
around the world and a fall in the U.S. unemployment rate point
to sustained momentum in the global recovery, while China's
latest move is seen as proactively tackling inflation problems.
 ""Global markets may begin to see the frequent rate hikes as
a sign that growth slowdown in China is inevitable, which could
briefly weigh on market sentiment,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk,
senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 ""But in the end the move will be seen as a sign of strength,
with solid growth momentum allowing policymakers to raise rates
-- and... global markets should respond positively to such moves
aimed at controlling inflation.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.15
percent, having hit its highest level since August 2008 on
Monday. The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> was
still up around 0.1 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell half a percent,
turning negative after China's move and moving away from the
previous day's 29-month high.
 U.S. crude oil was the biggest loser after China's move. It
 fell 1.5 percent to $86.18 a barrel as expectations rose
that the higher cost of borrowing may tame oil demand growth in
China, which is the largest energy consumer in the world
according to the International Energy Agency.
 U.S. stock futures  were slightly higher on the day.
 Benchmark U.S. equity indexes hit 2-1/2 year highs on

[ID:nN07200008]
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.2 percent on the day.
China is closed for the Lunar New Year holidays. 
 From Feb 9, China's benchmark one-year deposit rates will be
lifted by 25 basis points to 3 percent, while one-year lending
rates will also be raised by 25 basis points to 6.06 percent.
German government bond futures  were steady on the day.
 
 RATE MOVES EYED
 The Australian dollar  fell around half a U.S. cent
to $1.0130, tracking commodity prices lower after China's move.
 In the broader currency market however, the focus was on
U.S. and euro zone monetary policies. The euro recovered on
Tuesday, having been under pressure after last week's comments
from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet cooled
expectations on the pace of monetary tightening.
 The euro  rose 0.6 percent to $1.3662  while the
dollar <.DXY> fell 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 ""Our risk-adjusted yield differential indicator has given a
fresh euro/dollar sell signal over the past couple of days and
we look to use any initial corrective rebound today to establish
bearish strategies,"" BNP Paribas said in a note to clients.
 Last week's unexpected fall in the U.S. jobless rate also
sparked a rise in U.S. debt yields. The 10-year U.S. yield
 broke above a trading range that had been in place
since early December and U.S. money markets have started to
price in some chance of a U.S. rate hike later this year.
 Still, investors are reluctant to buy the dollar
aggressively after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said
last week that the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help -- a
stance many traders expect him to repeat when he speaks on
Wednesday.

(CDU) in the European Parliament no longer categorically oppose
euro bonds, contrary to the line of the CDU members in the
domestic parliament, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday.	
 ""Euro bonds are worth considering as long as they are tied
to strict conditions,"" Werner Langen, the head of the CDU/CSU
group in European Parliament, was quoted as saying in the paper.	
 The idea of euro zone joint bonds, pushed by Eurogroup chief
Jean-Claude Juncker and Italy's Giulio Tremonti, has gained
traction among some member states, such as struggling Greece,
who expect it could help the bloc through its debt woes.	
 Berlin and Paris have opposed the idea of issuing joint
bonds, arguing that a common interest rate would raise their own
borrowing costs and remove a key market incentive for fiscal
discipline in countries with high debts and deficits.	
 ""There are interesting approaches that make euro bonds seem
certainly economically possible and sensible,"" the newspaper
quoted from a discussion paper in the CDU group of the EP.
The paper proposes swapping Greek, Portuguese and Irish debt at
a markdown for euro bonds, with investors writing down 130
billion euros of those states' sovereign debt.	
 The other 14 member states could give a political
declaration to guarantee up to 60 percent of each other's
sovereign debt, Handelsblatt cited from the internal paper.	
 The CDU/CSU faction in the European Parliament is part of
the centre-right European People's Party grouping, in which it
feared isolation if it stuck to its strict ""no"", the paper said.
However, it said there were still opponents within the German
group.

of imports of U.S. beef on Tuesday after finding meat that could
not be confirmed to comply with its restrictions, officials said,
in what was called the 14th violation by U.S. beef producers in
four years.
 The farm ministry said it found cattle parts that could not
be confirmed to be from cows aged 20 months or younger, as
required, and the U.S. side could not verify it.
 The ministry said it was halting beef imports from a meat
packaging facility in Nebraska until it received detailed reports
of U.S. investigations.
 Japan was the biggest export market for U.S. beef until mad
cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), was found in the United States in December 2003, prompting
Tokyo to impose a ban.
 Since July 2006, Japan has restricted U.S. beef imports to
meat from cattle aged 20 months or younger. The U.S. has stressed
the safety and quality of its beef, saying the 20-month age
restriction has no scientific basis.
 Talks had been deadlocked since mid-2007, when the last
face-to-face negotiations were held, but resumed last September
when a working-level meeting was held in San Francisco.
 Japanese public concerns about U.S. beef linger on as some
cow body parts, such as bone, banned by Japanese import
regulations have been found in beef shipments from the U.S.

 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The fund of hedge funds arm of
UK-based Hermes aims to boost its assets by three times to $5
billion in five years by tapping growing demand for alternative
investments in countries including Japan, the head of the company
said.
 Hermes BPK is hoping that its experience managing British
Telecom's (BT) pension scheme will help it win the confidence of
typically risk-adverse investors in Japan, the world's second
biggest institutional market.
 ""Japanese institutional investors are very concerned as they
were scarred a bit by their experiences in 2008 (in the wake of
the global financial crisis) in the alternative
industry,"" Matteo Perruccio, chief executive and founding partner
of Hermes BPK Partners, told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Although that being said, they are smart investors and
they understand the alternative space is going to be very
interesting in the next couple of years.""
 The company, which manages more than $1.5 billion in assets
in three product classes, expects to service high amounts of
money from a small number of Japanese investors, Perruccio said.
 Besides Japan, Hermes BPK is also focusing on drawing
investors from the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland
and Australia.
 Hermes BPK, established in 2008, is a partnership between its
directors and Hermes Fund Managers, an asset management group
wholly owned by the BT pension scheme. Hermes Fund Managers owns
61.5 percent and the partners hold 38.5 percent.
 The fund company offers a system where its clients are
allowed to claw back performance fees if funds fail to meet
targets.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The euro edged off a two-week low on
Tuesday but lacked momentum after a drubbing the previous day
when weak German industrial data took the wind out of
expectations for a near-term euro zone rate hike.
 But with more Asian market players returning from Lunar New
Year holidays, traders remained wary of more potential euro
buying by Asian central banks after they helped push the euro
higher on Monday.
 Such speculation helped to lift the euro to $1.3610, up 0.2
percent from late U.S. levels and about a full cent above a
two-week low of $1.3508 hit on Monday.
 Surprisingly weak German industrial orders data for December
had triggered selling of the euro, although analysts said the
soft figures partly reflected a strong reading in November.
 But the single currency was holding above major supports,
including $1.3535, which had been a key resistance level in late
January and is its 100-day moving average, as well as $1.3480, a
38.2 percent retracement of its January-February rally,
 ""I think the euro will be supported but it will need a dose
of hawkishness from the European Central Bank to rise,"" said Koji
Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse.
 Last week, the euro started descending from a 12-week high of
$1.3862 after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
doused expectations for an imminent rate increase, saying
inflation would remain contained.
 That was followed by an unexpected fall in the U.S. jobless
rate, which sparked a rise in U.S. debt yields, further helping
the dollar against the euro.
 The 10-year U.S. yield broke above a trading range that had
been in place since early December and U.S. money markets have
started to price in some chance of a U.S. rate hike later this
year.
 Still, traders are reluctant to bet aggressively against the
euro after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week
that the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help -- a stance many
traders expect him to repeat when he speaks on Wednesday.
 ""The market seems to be in limbo. I don't think Bernanke's
comments will change that,"" said a trader at a Japanese
brokerage.
 One currency that is benefiting from expectations of an early
rate hike is the British pound, as chances of an early rate hike
still smouldered ahead of the Bank of England's policy
announcement on Thursday.
 The pound ticked up 0.15 percent in Asian trade to $1.6135,
about 1 percent below a three-month high of $1.6279 hit last
week.
 Financial markets are expecting a BoE rate hike by May, with
a small chance of a hike this week priced in, but analysts'
expectations are quite different with many not expecting one
until the end of the year.
 ""As European currencies had been riding on rate hike hopes,
the BoE's policy meeting will be important not just for sterling
but also for the general outlook of the dollar,"" said Hideaki
Inoue, a manager at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking.
 The dollar was in a holding pattern against the yen, capped
by selling by Japanese exporters at 82.50 yen and above.
 While a rise in U.S. bond yields in theory supports the
dollar, buying by Japanese investors seems limited in the near
term, some market players said.
 ""Yen-selling by Japanese mutual funds has been dwindling,
while many institutional investors do not want to take risks
ahead of their book-closings in March,"" said Credit Suisse's
Fukaya.

 * Oil steady as Egypt concerns ease

 By Alex Richardson	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Most Asian share markets
struggled for traction on Tuesday, but Japan's Nikkei hit a
fresh 9-month high and Australian stocks rose as hopes of a
sustained recovery for the rich world encouraged investors to
switch funds from emerging to developed markets.	
 The euro edged up from a two-week low plumbed after
surprising weak German industrial orders data, but fading
expectations of a near-term eurozone interest rate rise stopped
the single currency from pushing too much higher. 
 U.S. S&P 500 futures were flat. Merger activity drove
U.S. stocks to two-and-half year highs on Monday, when the Dow
Jones industrial average and broader S&P 500 both
rose 0.6 percent. 
 Market players in Tokyo said better-than-expected earnings
reports from U.S. and Japanese companies have accelerated a
shift of money out of inflation-dogged emerging markets and into
developed markets with loose monetary policies and more subdued
price pressures. 
 ""The performance of all emerging markets, including Brazil,
India, Indonesia and China, has been very weak this year and the
shift of market focus to developed economies with lower
inflationary risk is helping Tokyo stocks,"" said Norihiro
Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities.	
 
 Data from Lipper last week showed a record $4.1 billion
outflow from emerging market equity funds in the week to Feb. 2.	
 Despite sluggish economic growth and persistent deflation,
Japan has been the best performing Asian market so far in 2011,
with year-to-date gains of around 4 percent.	
 The Nikkei rose 0.4 percent, but MSCI's index of
Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.2
percent, led by a 1 percent decline for the tech sector, with
markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and India in
negative territory.	
 Australian shares rose 0.5 percent as positive
earnings from National Australia Bank lifted the top
four lenders, but shares in investment bank Macquarie
fell 0.3 percent after it lowered its full-year profit guidance.	
 Shares in National Australia Bank, the country's top lender,
gained 1.9 percent on the back of a forecast-beating 18 percent
rise in first-quarter cash profit.	
 ""Every time they come out with a result that says basic
operations have done reasonably well and conditions are all
tracking in the right direction, you get a steady decrease in
the perceptions of risk that go with NAB,"" said Angus Gluskie,
chief investment officer at White Funds Management.	
 
 CENTRAL BANK BUYING	
 The euro rose to around $1.3625, having fallen to $1.3508 on
Monday. Some traders were wary of more buying by Asian central
banks, which had helped push the single currency higher in the
previous session.	
 ""I think that's the train of thought market players have,
because they have been intervening constantly,"" said a trader at
a major Japanese bank in Singapore.	
 The euro has retreated from a 12-week high of $1.3862 since
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet last week
doused expectations of an imminent interest rate rise, saying
inflation in the eurozone would remain contained.	
 ""I think the euro will be supported, but it will need a dose
of hawkishness from the European Central Bank to rise,"" said
Koji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.	
 The dollar was steady against the yen around 82.30 ,
capped by selling by Japanese exporters at 82.50 yen and above.	
 U.S. crude oil futures were almost unchanged at
$87.49 a barrel, as concerns about unrest in Egypt affecting
global supplies eased and as investors turned their attention to
rising U.S. inventories. Brent crude futures edged up to
$99.37. 
 ""There's pressure for crude oil prices to go down,"" said Ken
Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives manager at Japan's Newedge
brokerage. ""Fundamentally, I don't think crude oil supplies are
tight. The market needs a correction, and now is the time.""	
 Gold was a touch higher at $1,351.30 an ounce, well
below the record high around $1,430 scaled in December and under
pressure from rising global stock markets that encouraged
investors to switch funds from the safe haven metal into riskier
assets.

 * Speech to business group avoids discussion of Egypt
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - A top U.S. trade official
said on Monday he was optimistic about U.S. export growth to
Arab countries, but steered clear of the turbulent political
situation in Egypt, the most populous Arab nation.
 ""Change is afoot throughout the region, and nothing can
safeguard the region more so than economic progress,"" Commerce
Under Secretary Francisco Sanchez said in a speech to the
National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce.
 The business group released a report on Monday forecasting
U.S. goods and services exports to the Middle East and North
Africa will increase to $117 billion by 2013, from an estimated
record of nearly $68 billion in 2010.
 Sanchez highlighted potential new exports to the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the two biggest U.S. export
markets in the Arab world.
 The UAE's push into nuclear power and other efforts to
diversify its economy create a number of new business
opportunities, while Saudi Arabia is planning ""a massive
infrastructure project of more than $400 billion in the next 10
years,"" Sanchez said.
 At the same time, ""Saudi business leaders are concerned
that American companies are lagging behind European, Chinese
and Korean companies in taking advantage of numerous business
opportunities in the region,"" he said.
 Sanchez also spotlighted Qatar, which he said is spending
$65 billion to prepare to host the 2022 World Cup soccer games
and planning $120 billion over the next 10 years on road,
ports, rail and other infrastructure projects.
 Sanchez did not mention Egypt, the third largest U.S.
export market in the region, where President Hosni Mubarak is
clinging to power despite protests calling for an end to his
30-year presidency.
 In a sign of how delicately the U.S. government views that
situation, Sanchez agreed to take questions after his speech
with the stipulation his answers were ""off the record.""
 Last year, the United States exported more than $6 billion
worth of goods to Egypt, including farm products, civilian
aircraft, military equipment and armaments.
 It imported more than $2 billion of goods from Egypt. The
single biggest item was natural gas, followed by clothing and
household goods made from cotton.
 Egypt, one of the relatively few countries that runs a
trade deficit with the United States, has long wanted a free
trade agreement with the United States.
 However, concerns about Mubarak's commitments to political
reforms have stood in the way of that.
 Last year, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk traveled to
Cairo for meetings under a bilateral forum called the Strategic
Partnership for Trade-Related and Investment Issues.
 USTR has not announced any dates for meetings under that
forum in 2011.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Strong corporate earnings and
mining shares boosted world stocks to a 29-month high on Monday
and copper rose to a record on supply concerns and improved
sentiment of economic recovery.
 Rising commodity prices, along with another uptick in U.S.
Treasury yields, deepened concerns about inflationary
pressures.
 Worries about inflation damping down economic growth and
political risk from Egypt have been responsible for a shift in
assets out of emerging markets into developed economies.
 World equities as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 0.53 percent after gaining 2.2
percent last week. The index is up 3.4 percent so far this
year, while the MSCI emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> is down 2
percent.
 ""A lot of analysts are saying that we need a correction
before we can move higher, but I think there's still room to
grow,"" said Ron Kiddoo, chief investment officer at Cozad Asset
Management in Champaign, Illinois, which has $700 million in
assets under management.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 69.40
points, or 0.57 percent, at 12,161.55. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 8.18 points, or 0.62 percent, at
1,319.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 14.69
points, or 0.53 percent, at 2,783.99.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed at its highest level since September 2008, up 1 percent
at 1176.81, supported by mining companies as copper hit a fresh
record on supply concerns from top producer Chile.
 Concerns over higher inflation in booming emerging markets,
further indications of economic recovery gathering pace in the
United States, modest valuations and tentative signs of
stability in the euro zone sovereign debt crisis have fueled
the outperformance of shares in developed markets.
 Data from fund tracker EPFR Global showed investors pulled
out $7 billion from emerging markets equity funds in the week
of Feb 2, their biggest outflow in three years, and much of the
money is flowing into developed markets.
 The euro paired losses against the dollar after touching a
two-week low, but downward pressure is likely to remain after a
bigger-than-expected fall in German industrial orders
emboldened the stance that euro zone interest rates will stay
steady for a while.
 The euro  was flat at $1.3585 in late afternoon
trade in New York. The dollar was unchanged against a basket of
major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> flat at
78.04. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.16
percent at 82.30.
 TREASURY YIELDS UP
 Nagging worries the Federal Reserve is clinging to a
near-zero interest rate policy for too long as inflation and
the economy accelerate sent U.S. Treasury prices lower.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 2/32, with the yield at 3.648 percent, while the 2-year
U.S. Treasury note  was down 2/32, with the yield at
0.7725 percent.
 Prices of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  ended
up 11/32, with the yield at 4.7078 percent, down from yield
levels touched earlier in the day of 4.75 percent, levels not
seen since last spring.
 Copper  backed away later in the trading day from a
new record hit at $10,160 due to the rise of the U.S. dollar.
 But concerns about supply, especially from top producer
Chile, and a recent stream of positive economic data that
boosted the outlook for industrial metals demand, combined to
push commodities prices higher.
 Tin  also hit a record high on worries about supply
problems in top exporter Indonesia.
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.99 percent, to $87.25 per
barrel, and spot gold prices  ended flat at $1348.75 an
ounce.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The euro was roughly unchanged
against the U.S. dollar on Monday after reaching a two-week
low, but losses are seen likely after weak German industrial
data emboldened the stance that euro zone interest rates will
stay steady for a while.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet doused
expectations of an imminent rate increase last week, saying
inflation would remain contained. The German data bolstered
that view, prompting investors to further book profits after
the single currency's new year rally. For details, see
[ID:nLDE7160ZR]
 Analysts said the euro's near-term direction would hinge on
the progress of discussions on a euro zone debt rescue fund.
 The dollar weakened against the euro throughout most of
January on expectations that rising inflation would prompt the
ECB to raise interest rates much earlier than the U.S. central
bank.
 ""Those expectations were far too speculative and thus why
we have seen a sharp turnaround this past week,"" said Jessica
Hoversen, foreign exchange and fixed income analyst at MF
Global in Chicago.
 A number of recent positive economic reports have helped
improve the U.S. economy's outlook and suggest that the Federal
Reserve may not need to stimulate the economy any further.
 Hoversen said profit taking and a disappointing read of
German industrial orders helped weaken the euro versus the
dollar.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro 
slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3577. It hit a low of $1.3508 on
electronic trading platform EBS.
 The euro had hit a two-week low, falling below the current
100-day simple moving average, a key support, at around
$1.3532. Investors focused on $1.3500, followed by $1.3480, the
38.2 percent retracement of the January-to-February rally.
 ""Meanwhile, we expect U.S. rates, both on the short- and
long-end of the yield curve, to continue to head higher, which
bodes well for the dollar,"" she said.
 Market participants are starting to factor in higher U.S.
interest rates for 2012, particularly after Friday's jobs
report, which showed a decline in the unemployment rate to 9.0
percent last month. That led to a rise in benchmark U.S. yields
and a widening of the spread against 10-year German bunds in
favor of U.S. Treasuries, a move that added to the appeal of
the dollar.
 Worries the Fed is clinging to a near-zero interest rate
policy for too long as inflation and the economy accelerate
sent U.S. Treasury prices lower on Monday for a sixth straight
session. Treasury debt yields rose to levels reached last
spring.
 ""What's going on in U.S. rates has really diverged from
what's going on in European rates, especially after Trichet
sounded less hawkish than expected,"" said Jens Nordvig, global
head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura Securities International Inc

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Strong corporate earnings and
mining shares boosted world stocks to a 29-month high on Monday
and copper hit a record high on supply disruptions.
 Rising commodity prices, along with another uptick in U.S.
Treasury yields, deepened concerns about inflationary
pressures.
 Worries about inflation damping down economic growth in
emerging markets have been responsible for a shift in assets
into developed economies.
 World equities as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 0.55 percent after gaining 2.2
percent last week. The index is up 3.4 percent so far this
year, while the MSCI emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> is down 2

 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed at its highest level since September 2008, up 1 percent
at 1176.81, supported by mining companies as copper hit a fresh
record on supply concerns from top producer Chile.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 79.85

1,320.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 23.33
points, or 0.84 percent, at 2,792.63.
 Concerns over higher inflation in booming emerging markets,
further indications of economic recovery gathering pace in the
United States, modest valuations and tentative signs of
stability in the euro zone sovereign debt crisis have fueled
the outperformance of shares in developed markets.
 Data from fund tracker EPFR Global showed investors pulled
out $7 billion from emerging markets equity funds in the week
of Feb 2, their biggest outflow in three years, and much of the
money is flowing into developed markets.
 The euro fell to a two-week low against the dollar after a
bigger-than-expected fall in German industrial orders prompted
investors to book profits after the single currency's new year
rally.
 The euro  was down 0.28 at $1.3547 as German
industrial orders fell 3.4 percent in December, worse than
forecasts for a 1.5 percent fall, on weak demand outside the
euro zone. For details, see [ID:nLDE7160ZR]
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.20 percent at 78.20.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.30 percent
at 82.42.
 TREASURY YIELDS UP
 U.S. Treasury debt yields rose to levels seen last spring
with 30-year  yields briefly piercing 4.75 percent.
Dealers said Treasury prices, which have been falling for
several days on views the economy and inflation were
accelerating, were further weighed down in anticipation of new
supply this week.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 9/32, with the yield at 3.6762 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 3/32, with the yield at
0.7925 percent.
 Copper  hit a record at $10,160. Concerns about
supply, especially from top producer Chile, and a recent stream
of positive economic data that boosted the outlook for
industrial metals demand, combined to push prices higher.
 Tin  also hit a record high on worries about supply
problems in top exporter Indonesia.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar for a fourth straight day on Monday, with more losses
seen likely, as soft German industrial data reinforced the view
that euro zone interest rates will remain low for some time.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet doused
expectations of an imminent rate increase last week, saying
inflation would remain contained. The German data bolstered
that view, prompting investors to further book profits after
the single currency's new year rally.
 Analysts said the euro's near-term direction would hinge on
the progress of discussions on a euro zone debt rescue fund.
 In contrast, market participants started to factor in
higher U.S. interest rates for 2012, particularly following a
decline in the unemployment rate to 9.0 percent last month.
That led to a rise in benchmark U.S. yields and a widening of
the spread against 10-year German bunds in favor of U.S.
Treasuries, a move that added to the appeal of the dollar.
 The euro hit a two-week low, falling below the current
100-day simple moving average, a key support, at around
$1.3532. Investors focused on $1.3500, followed by $1.3480, the
38.2 percent retracement of the January-to-February rally.
 ""What's going on in U.S. rates has really diverged from
what's going on in European rates, especially after Trichet
sounded less hawkish than expected,"" said Jens Nordvig, global
head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura Securities International Inc
in New York.
 ""We now have a market thinking of a Fed exit from zero
rates in 2012. That's a pretty big deal, and that's giving the
dollar some support.""
 In mid-day New York trading, the euro slipped 0.2 percent
to $1.3561, extending losses made after the U.S. payrolls
report on Friday. It hit a low of $1.3508 on electronic trading
platform EBS.
 Traders said the German data triggered stop-loss orders on
the downside, overtaking earlier demand from Asian firms as
regional markets resumed trading after the lunar new year
holidays.
 David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said that given euro zone debt problems,
the euro has had a good run and overcome most of the hurdles.

even with no concrete solution on the debt crisis.
 The 25 delta risk reversals, a measure of risk sentiment,
on front-end euro/dollar are still showing a bias toward puts,
or expectations for a currency decline, but the puts have
become less extreme.
 Meanwhile, implied volatility on the one-month euro/dollar
contract declined for a second straight day, trading at around
11.3 percent, suggesting a far calmer market than in November
and December.
 In the latest week, currency speculators raised bets on the
euro to the highest level since late October after weeks of
significant shorting, according to the latest data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, which tracks the greenback
against a basket of major currencies, edged up 0.1 percent on
the day to 78.124, off a three-month low of 76.881 last week.
 The dollar added 0.2 percent at 82.38 yen after rising more
than 1 yen from a one-month low of 81.10 hit just after the

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on
Monday, touching a 29-month high on merger news, rising
commodity prices and flows into developed economies as
investors bet on a stronger global economy.
 Copper and tin hit record highs and U.S. 10-year Treasury
yields rose to levels not seen since May. The higher yields
supported the dollar, which rose to two-week highs against the
euro after a bigger-than-expected fall in German industrial
orders prompted investors to book profits on the single

 The political turmoil in Egypt kept traders glued to their
televisions and computers, but it took a backseat when putting

 Merger news lifted U.S. stocks. Diversified industrial
company Danaher Corp  agreed to buy medical diagnostics

 The deals provided the latest indication stock valuations
are considered attractive.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2011 11:44AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Further lira fall may hit inflation-Turkey c.bank," LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank appears to
be succeeding with efforts to cool inflows of speculative
capital and the bank is aware of the dangers posed to inflation
by further lira weakening, Governor Durmus Yilmaz said on
Monday.
 In an interview with Reuters Insider television, he also
declined to rule out further action on reserve ratios, which it
raised to drain excess liquidity and curb credit growth as part
of a dramatic policy shift late last year.
 The bank's aim is to weaken the lira, making imports more
expensive, cooling domestic demand and helping reduce Turkey's
current account deficit -- seen as a key weakness when its
economy is growing robustly.
 ""There was some depreciation of the currency which was a
deterrent to the short term capital coming into the country and
also the short-term swap rates,"" Yilmaz told 
 He stressed however that the bank was not targeting any
specific exchange rate.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 To view the Insider interview: http://link.reuters.com/pyk87r
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The lira has fallen around 5 percent against the dollar
 since the central bank introduced the policy, and fears
are growing that the bank could be making a policy mistake that
may push Turkey into an inflation spiral.
 But Yilmaz said the central bank was confident in what it
was doing and was aware of the dangers of lira weakness.
 ""We are very mindful that any further...depreciation of the
currency, if commodity prices increase further, will impact the
inflation outlook in a negative way,"" Yilmaz said.
 ""The policies that we have introduced so far have been
successful, there has been some depreciation of the currency,
deterring short-term money coming into the country, into
short-term swap markets,"" he added.
 He noted that there was evidence money was moving to
long-term deposits and longer-term swaps away from shorter
maturities.
 The increase in reserve requirement ratios is aimed at
limiting bank credit growth to 20-25 percent this year. He
refused to rule out further such moves.
 ""If the measures are not adequate, we may take further
action. We have to see the results of the action we have already
taken,"" he said, adding the central bank aimed to withdraw 5.8
percent of the total domestic loan stock.
 ""The currency initiative has worked and we will see on the
credit side.""

 (Adds confirmation, analyst comment)
 By Jan Lopatka
 PRAGUE, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Respected economist Lubomir Lizal
will join the Czech central bank board on Tuesday, replacing
Robert Holman, whose term runs out this week, the president's
office said on Monday.
 Lizal, 41, is an internationally trained economist and
associate professor at Prague's Charles University economics
research institute CERGE-EI, with expertise including
transitional economies and international trade.
 President Vaclav Klaus's office said Lizal would be
appointed for a six-year term on Tuesday along with current
board member Pavel Rezabek, who will be granted a second term.
 The appointment and reappointment are not set to
significantly alter the board's monetary policy views.
 Holman has generally favoured rate stability, although a
named voting record has not been published from last week when
the board voted narrowly 4-3 against lifting the main repo rate
from record low of 0.75 percent.
 Rezabek made hawkish comments on the rate outlook last
month, but most analysts believe the bank will not hike
aggressively in the coming months.
 Lizal has advised the main Czech right-wing party, the Civic
Democrats, and has worked for the government's national economic
advisory council, NERV. His views on monetary policy are little
known but economists expected a middle-of-the-road stance.
 ""He is very well equipped instrumentally. He has good
understanding of the micro side and can be a contribution to the
bank board in that,"" said Michal Mejstrik, an economics
professor who has worked with Lizal.
 ""He can take bold decisions if backed by solid evidence.""
 Lizal was not immediately available for comment. 
 A senior researcher at the economic institute of the Czech
Academy of Sciences, he has a Ph.D. with specialisation in
transition economics, applied microeconomics, econometrics,
industrial organisation and international trade.
 He worked as an external consultant for the World Bank and
an expert evaluator for the European Commission.
 U.S. trained, Lizal held fellowships at the University of
Pittsburgh and the William Davidson Institute at the University
of Michigan in the 1990's, as well as at the Tinbergen Institute
in Amsterdam.

 When: Thursday Feb 10 at 1200 GMT
 BoE seen keeping rates at 0.5 percent; 1 in 5 chance of
rise to 0.75 percent
 
 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will have to
decide this week whether its first priority is to tackle soaring
inflation or to support Britain's fitful economic recovery.
 Such opposing risks put Britain's central bank in an
unenviable dilemma and mean Thursday's decision is the first
since rates were cut to record lows in March 2009 when investors
have felt in any real doubt about the outcome on rates.
 News Britain's economy contracted at the end of 2010 has
encouraged analysts to stick with their view that the BoE will
keep interest rates on hold until much later in the year. A
Reuters poll last week showed only 21 out of 67 analysts thought
rates would go up before the fourth quarter.
 However, with pipeline price pressures building and the
BoE's credibility under threat, money markets are pricing in
around a 20 percent chance of a quarter point rise to 0.75
percent this week, and a 100 percent chance of such a move by
May.
 The contrast between analysts' views and Sterling Overnight
Interbank Average Rates may partly reflect overshooting by the
market. After many months when investors saw little need to
hedge against a rise in interest rates, they have been piling
into the market to do so, distorting prices.
 UK interest rates have stood at 0.5 percent since March
2009, when the BoE slammed monetary easing onto full throttle to
protect the economy from the ravages of recession and deflation.
 Fast-forward two years and Britain's problem is with prices
rising rather than falling. Inflation hit an eight-month high of
3.7 percent in December, almost twice the central bank's target,
and looks set to rise even higher in the coming months.
 ""We expect the Monetary Policy Committee will leave rates on
hold at the upcoming meeting but it may be a much closer call
than many expect,"" said Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi.
 ""We expect that inflation will stay above target for an
extended period, not just this year but probably 2012 and 2013
as well.""
 
 CREDIBILITY AT STAKE
 A rise in interest rates might reassure investors that the
central bank was serious about bringing inflation back to target
-- something they have started to doubt after three years of
persistent overshoots. 
 BoE policymakers will have updated inflation and growth
forecasts this week that are likely to show consumer price
inflation approaching 5 percent in the coming months.
 The doves on the BoE's monetary policy committee might take
comfort from the fact that domestically-generated inflation
remains benign. Although public inflation expectations have
risen, wage inflation remains subdued by historical standards,
running at a year-on-year rate of 2.1 percent in the three
months to November.
 The hawks, led by Andrew Sentance and Martin Weale -- two
members who voted for a rate rise in January -- will argue that
pre-emptive action is needed: by the time second-round inflation
effects are felt, it is too late to put the inflation genie back
in the bottle.
 In an interview last week, BoE Deputy Governor Charles Bean
said that if oil prices surged and inflation became embedded,
then interest rates would have to rise even if growth was weak.

 With the outlook so murky, BoE policymakers might decide to
keep policy unchanged this month but send a message, spelt out
in next week's Inflation Report, that rate rises might not be
far away. That would avert a shock move this month and pave the
way for a rise in March or April.
 ""There is now major uncertainty over interest rate prospects
in both the very near term and further out,"" said Howard Archer
at IHS Global Insight.
 ""Further increases in headline inflation over the coming
months and rising inflation expectations could well force the
Bank of England's hand sooner rather than later.""

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar for a fourth straight day on Monday, with further
weakness seen likely, as soft German industrial data prompted
investors to book profits after the single currency's new year
rally.
 The euro hit a two-week low, falling below the current
100-day simple moving average, a key support, at around
$1.3532. Investors focused on $1.3500, followed by $1.3480, the
38.2 percent retracement of the January-to-February rally.
 Investors sold the euro as they pared back expectations of
a euro zone rate hike in the coming months and analysts said
its near-term direction would still hinge on the progress of
discussions on a euro zone debt rescue fund.
 David Watt, senior currency strategist, at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said that given the euro zone's debt
problems, the euro has had a good run and overcome most of the
hurdles.
 ""But (European Union) realities are starting to creep back
in and the reality is there is still no long-term plan to
address the crisis. So I think investors are quite happy to
sell into the euro's rallies.""
 Further weakening the euro's resolve was a report showing
German industrial orders fell 3.4 percent in December, worse
than forecasts for a 1.5 percent fall, on weak demand outside
the euro zone. The data highlighted the German economy's
reliance on external demand.
 In addition, U.S. Treasury yields have moved higher on
expectations of a stable recovery in the world's largest
economy, supporting the dollar. Friday's report showing a
decline in the U.S. unemployment rate to 9.0 percent added to
that view and raised questions over whether the Federal Reserve
would keep interest rates low for a long time.
 ""Those sentiments appear more dominant in the market at
present and more consistent with the continued rise in U.S.
yields,"" said Bob Lynch, senior currency strategist at HSBC
Bank in New York.
 In early New York trading, the euro fell 0.5 percent to
$1.3521, extending losses made after the U.S. payrolls report
on Friday. It hit a low of $1.3512 on electronic trading
platform EBS.
 Traders said the German data triggered stop-loss orders on
the downside, overtaking earlier demand from Asian firms as
most Asian markets resumed trading after the lunar new year
holidays.
 Euro positioning has also become more neutral after
significant shorts taken on the currency. Currency speculators
raised their bets on it for the week to Feb. 1 to the most
since late October.
 The ICE Futures' dollar index, which tracks the greenback
against a basket of major currencies, edged up 0.3 percent on
the day to 78.263, off a three-month low of 76.881 last week.
 The dollar was up slightly at 82.29 yen, after rising more
than 1 yen from a one-month low of 81.10 hit just after the
Friday jobs data. Resistance was at 82.56, the top of the
Ichimoku cloud, a closely watched technical indicator.

 JERUSALEM, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel has decided
that it would continue a nearly three-year policy of buying
foreign currency to keep the shekel  from appreciating
rapidly, minutes of a Jan. 24 rates decision showed on Monday.
 In the meeting that ended with a quarter-point increase in
the benchmark rate  to 2.25 percent, the question
came up whether there was a need for intervention in the foreign
exchange market, and if so, what degree was required.
 ""Discussion focused particularly on how much flexibility the
exchange rate should be allowed, and the implications of various
scenarios on the trade balance and on capital flows. It was
agreed that in light of the developments on the real side during
2010, the Bank of Israel's policy ... was still essential and
should continue,"" the minutes said.
 The central bank started intervening in the market in March
2008 with $25 million a day, a level that rose to $100 million
four months later. Since August 2009, intervention has been on
days the Bank of Israel deems necessary.
 It bought $2.085 billion of foreign currency in January
after buying $1.815 billion in December.
 The Bank of Israel, which has made slowing the shekel's
rise central to its monetary policy, has bought tens of billions
of dollars over the past three years but the Israeli currency
has stayed strong, partly due to a wide interest rates gap with
the United States and Europe -- Israel's main trading partners.
 Some officials expressed fears of a further appreciation of
the shekel should the central bank raise rates. But new central
bank directives [ID:nLDE70J1KN] aimed at moderating the effects
of wider interest rate differentials on the shekel allowed the
rate hike to proceed, the minutes said.
 Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer's decision to raise
the key rate was supported by all four central bank officials.
The increase was the first such move in four months and the
seventh time since August 2009. The current interest rate is
deemed expansionary, the bank said.
 
 INFLATION
 Inflation, according to the bond market and economists, is
expected to remain at 3 percent or above for most of 2011,
higher than an annual target of 1-3 percent. That, the minutes
said, ""indicate the need for an increase in the interest rate.""
 Israel had inflation 2.7 percent in 2010, much of that
stemming from gains in housing costs, an issue that was a major
challenge for the central bank last year.
 House prices rose 17 percent in 2010 as low interest rates
led to a rapid expansion of housing credit, while housing demand
outpaced supply. Central bank officials agreed ""there was a
significant probability that housing prices would continue their
rapid rate of increase in the coming year"".
 In addition to interest rate hikes, the Bank of Israel has
already taken a number of steps aimed at raising banks' mortgage
loan rates. Policymakers said they would introduce further
measures ""if there was no change in the path of prices and in
the degree of leverage"".
 Also supporting a rate increase last month was Israel's
""substantial expansion"" of the economy and employment levels.
After growing 4.5 percent in 2010, the central bank sees strong
growth continuing in the first quarter of 2011, which would
boost inflation, the minutes said.
 ""It was also noted that the most recent data indicate more
positive assessments of the recovery of the global economy from
the economic crisis,"" the central bank said.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped to a session low
against the dollar on Monday after a weak reading of German
industrial orders accelerated profit-taking prompted by data on
Friday showing a lower U.S. jobless rate.
 German industrial orders fell 3.4 percent on the month in
December, more than forecasts for a 1.5 percent fall, due to
weak demand outside the euro zone. The data highlighted the
German economy's reliance on external demand. [ID:nLDE7160ZR]
 Investors also sold the euro as they pared back expectations
of a European Central Bank rate rise, while analysts said the
currency's near-term direction would hinge on discussions about
strengthening the euro zone economy and its debt rescue fund.
 ""A lot of the optimism in the market is already priced into
the euro, so if you unwind that you get a 3-4 point fall,"" said
Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 ""For the euro to rally, you need significant positive
headlines from the core economies in regards to the EFSF fund
and measures for periphery countries.""
 By 1213 GMT, the euro  had fallen 0.4 percent on the
day to $1.3534, extending losses made after U.S. nonfarm
payrolls data on Friday.
 The German data triggered stop-loss orders on the downside,
overtaking earlier demand from Asian names, after most Asian
markets resumed trading after the lunar new year holidays.
 Further losses in the euro were limited for the moment by
support around $1.3530, its 100-day moving average.
The dollar was supported after investors brushed off a
smaller-than-expected rise in January U.S. payrolls late last
week and instead focused on drop in the jobless rate to 9.0
percent from 9.8 percent in November.
 The data is unlikely to prevent the Federal Reserve from
completing its $600 billion government bond-buying programme to
support the economy, but signs of underlying strength in the
labour market boosted U.S. bond yields.
 ""One employment report is not a secure sign for a change in
monetary policy,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst at UBS
in Zurich.
 He said euro positioning had become more neutral as many
speculative long euro positions were cut after ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet tempered his hawkish stance on inflation.
 Currency speculators had raised their bets on the single
currency for the week to Feb. 1 to the most since late October,
but Trichet played down inflation risks last Thursday, helping
knock the euro back from a near three-month high to the dollar.
 
 EURO ZONE INFIGHTING
 Reports of infighting over a French and German push for a
comprehensive package of reforms to address the euro zone debt
crisis also kept the euro on the back foot. [ID:nLDE7130E4]
 The apparent rift was a stark reminder of the difficulty of
getting an agreement in the 17-nation currency bloc, though
traders anticipate euro zone policymakers will hammer out more
steps to counter the debt crisis by March.
 ""The euro's had a good run but on the weekend we didn't see
much sign of progress on structural issues and they are no
closer to getting any resolution on a new bailout regime,"" said
Phil Poole, head of global and macro strategy at HSBC Global
Asset Management.
 ""The overhang for the euro is still there and if people
start to price out the rate hikes they had priced in, the euro
will weaken.""
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a
basket of major currencies, inched up on the day to 78.198
<.DXY> <=USD>, off a three-month low of 76.881 hit last week.
 The dollar was up slightly at 82.35 yen , after having
risen more than 1 yen from a one-month low of 81.10 yen hit
seconds after the U.S. payroll data on Friday. Resistance was at
82.56, the top of the closely watched Ichimoku cloud.

(Adds industry comment, details)	
 By Erik dela Cruz	
 MANILA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - A government panel has recommended
the Philippines import between 1.0 million and 1.5 million
tonnes of rice to meet this year's needs, and could wait till
peak harvest season before buying, a government source said on
Monday.	
 At a time of rising food prices globally, the Philippines
looks to be waiting for the harvest in Vietnam and Thailand to
see if prices moderate -- even though rice is one of the
commodities that remains well below record-high prices.	
 The Southeast Asian country bought a record 2.45 million
tonnes of the grain for 2010. It has yet to finalise its 2011
import plans, but officials had previously said it was looking
to halve imports and perhaps cut them to below 1.0 million
tonnes. 
 Large import orders for rice in two big Asian countries --
Indonesia and Bangladesh -- has sent worrying signal the
region's main staple may join a surge in prices for other
grains, worsening Asia's spiralling food inflation.

 ""The IAC (inter-agency committee) is recommending a volume
between 1.0 million and 1.5 million tonnes this year,"" the
source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity as the
official was not authorised to disclose the recommendation to
the media.	
 The source said Manila, the world's biggest buyer in recent
years, could firm up its import plans when the National Food
Authority (NFA) Council, the panel that decides the volume and
timing, meets again, possibly next week.	
 The Philippines expects unmilled rice output in the first
half of the year to rise 15.4 percent from a year earlier to
7.64 million tonnes, and plans to become self-sufficient by
2013. 
 ""Under normal circumstances, we see a bumper crop in the
summer,"" said Herculano Co, president of the Philippine
Confederation of Grains Associations.	
 ""But you really cannot be too optimistic these days given
the effects of climate change. We've seen floodings in many
parts of the country because of continuous heavy rains,"" he
said.

 STOCKS	
 A large build-up in rice stocks in 2010 has delayed this
year's import orders by Manila. The Philippines usually buys
most of its rice requirements from Vietnam, the world's
second-biggest exporter, and also has had deals with top
exporter Thailand.	
 While there was no need to rush buying given ample stocks,
the source said it would be ""ideal"" for Manila to enter the
market in coming months during peak harvest in Vietnam and
Thailand and before the lean season in the middle of the year.	
 The NFA Council, which is chaired by Agriculture Secretary
Proceso Alcala, last met on Jan 24. Alcala had said he would
call for another council meeting within two to three weeks.	
 The Philippines had rice stocks of 3.39 million tonnes at
the end of January, including NFA inventory of 1.7 million
tonnes, enough to cover domestic requirements for more than 90
days, NFA data showed. The NFA is required to maintain a 30-day
buffer stock during the lean season up to September.	
 Traders have said rice prices, which were steady last week,
were likely to fall towards the end of March because of rising
supply from Vietnam, which starts harvesting its main crop late
this month. 
 Thailand could produce a record high volume in its 2010/11
second crop to be harvested from late February to June, but
strong demand would hold prices up, adding to unease over food
price inflation, traders said.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Monday,
hovering near a 29-month high on further signs of global
economic recovery, and copper rallied to a record high while
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit their highest since May.
 Oil prices were also higher, while the euro fell to a
two-week low against the dollar after a bigger than expected
fall in German industrial orders.
 World equities as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index advanced 0.2 percent after gaining 2.2 percent last week.
The index is up 3.4 percent so far this year, while MSCI
emerging markets index is down 2 percent.
 ""At the moment, clients are feeling that any dips can be
bought into and the trend is an upwards one, and I can't see
that being thrown off course in the short term,"" said Giles
Watts, head of equities at City Index in London.
 Concerns over higher inflation in booming emerging markets,
further indications of economic recovery gathering pace in the
United States, modest valuations and tentative signs of
stability in the euro zone sovereign debt crisis have fuelled
the outperformance of shares in developed markets.
 Data from fund tracker EPFR Global showed investors pulled
out $7 billion from emerging markets equity funds in the week of
Feb 4, their biggest outflow in three years.
 The U.S. S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average hit new
2-1/2-year highs on Friday as a fall in U.S. unemployment raised
optimism of a labour market recovery.
 U.S. stock index futures put on 0.3
percent, indicating a firm open on Wall Street.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose 0.9 percent on
Monday, while Germany's DAX added 0.9 percent, shrugging off the
news that German industrial orders fell by 3.4 percent on the
month in December. Japan's Nikkei average put on 0.5 percent,
hitting a nine-month high.
 In terms of valuations, the S&P 500 carries a 12-month
forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.3 times, compared with a
10-year average of 15.5 though more expensive than the emerging
markets index's 11.3 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows.
 
 TREASURY YIELDS UP
 As optimism over the U.S. economic recovery grew, investors
were also shifting away from government bonds.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries rose 3 basis points
to 3.6701 percent, their highest level since early May and up
about 28 basis points since the start of the month.
 ""Investors are now reflecting that an ever-improving outlook
for the U.S. is a new factor in the equation, which is weighing
quite heavily on U.S. Treasuries,"" said Kornelius Purps,
strategist at Unicredit in Munich. 
 ""We have not only the (non-farm) labour report -- which was
a mixed bag but seen as a positive -- we have the ISM, which
were extremely positive and indicate the U.S. economy is
recovering at quite a healthy clip.""
 Spreads on 10-year Portugese government bonds over benchmark
German Bunds rose 5 bps to 386 bps, though still down about 8
bps since the beginning of the month, after Portugal, one of the
weakest euro zone economies, planned a five-year syndicated
bond.
 The euro eased 0.3 percent to $1.3552, while the dollar was
up 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies.
 Copper put on 1 percent to $10,152.75 a tonne after hitting
a record high of $10,153.50, while benchmark U.S. oil futures
rose 0.3 percent to trade above $89 a barrel.

 By Neil Chatterjee and Aditya Suharmoko	
 JAKARTA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Indonesia's economy grew in the
fourth quarter of 2010 at the strongest pace in six years,
blowing past expectations and increasing the chances of steeper
rate hikes in coming months to head off inflationary pressures.	
 For 2010 as a whole, Southeast Asia's top economy expanded
6.1 percent, underscoring some expectations that the G20 member
is in line for a coveted investment grade credit rating in the
next year or so to place it alongside the so-called BRIC nations
of Brazil, Russia, India and China.	
 Gross domestic product rose in the fourth quarter by 6.9
percent over a year earlier , well above even the most
optimistic forecast of 6.5 percent in a Reuters poll, helping
explain the central bank's concern about a buildup of
inflationary pressure that prompted it to raise interest rates
on Friday.	
 ""The growth outlook remains robust. This will attract more
investment into Indonesia. Inflation remains at the forefront of
Bank Indonesia's policy concerns with back-to-back 7 percent or
higher inflation,"" said Prakriti Sofat, an economist at Barclays
in Singapore.	
 ""In the next three to four months we expect up to a 75 basis
points rise in interest rates,"" she said.	
 That would be in line with a Reuters poll conducted last
week before the central bank surprised markets on Friday by
raising its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent from
a record low of 6.5 percent.	
 The poll predicted the policy rate would rise to 7.5 percent
by the end of 2011.	
 
 Analysts have been clamouring for Bank Indonesia to hike
rates for the past year, following regional peers.	
 Indeed, worries that the central bank was behind the curve
in tackling inflation, which reached a 21-month high of
7.02 percent in January , led to a selloff in bonds and
stocks last month, after the country had been an investor
darling in 2010.	
 But Friday's rate rise, the first in nearly two years,
helped ease those concerns and Monday's GDP data reinforced the
view that the central bank will have to keep raising rates to
counter the threat of inflation as the economy expands.	
 After the GDP data, the stock market picked up from
negative territory to trade steady, with the rally led by top
car seller Astra International and banks, while the
rupiah edged up to a 3-month high.	
 Ten-year bond yields have pulled back sharply by
more than 70 basis points as investors hunted for bargains after
the January sell off.	
 
 INVESTMENT NEW GROWTH ENGINE	
 The fourth-quarter growth, driven by government spending,
domestic consumption and investment, added to other figures
showing economies in Southeast Asia grew strongly into the end
of the year. 
 Singapore's gross domestic product rose 12.5 percent and the
Philippines 7.1 percent from a year earlier.	
 Before Monday's data, economists had expected Indonesia to
grow 6.2 percent in 2011, versus a government forecast of 6.4
percent. 
 President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is aiming for
7.7 percent annual growth by 2014, though analysts say the
country would need to speed up progress on overhauling
infrastructure to achieve that goal.	
 The government said on Monday it aims for $150 billion of
infrastructure investments by 2015, but is relying on foreign
investors for two-thirds of that amount. Japan has already
pledged about $53 billion over 15 years and is funding a metro
line for Jakarta. 
 But for now, airports, ports and roads are overwhelmed. Car
sales jumped 57 percent in 2010 to a record as an emerging
middle class in the world's fourth-most-populous nation snapped
up new models in a market dominated by Toyota .	
 The statistics bureau said each percentage point rise in GDP
growth adds over half a million new jobs.	
 Private consumption growth slowed in the fourth quarter
versus the third, but government expenditure and exports both
accelerated.	
 Government spending in Indonesia usually picks up the fourth
quarter as authorities rush to meet targets, with low spending
earlier in 2010 leading to a cut in debt issuance. Falling
government debt to GDP levels have spurred rating upgrades. 
 Wellian Wiranto, an economist with HSBC in Singapore,
described Monday's GDP growth figure in a report as ""a wow
number"" that meant the central bank should not be shy to
continue brandishing its recently-adopted tightening stance.	
 ""Today's GDP data also shows a subtle but important shift in
Indonesia's growth story. It is no longer all about domestic
consumption anymore... Taking an increasingly larger share of
GDP is investment,"" he said in a research report.	
 Total realised investment grew 54 percent last year, with
foreign direct investment rising to a record $16.4 billion as
firms -- particularly from Asia -- put money into plants to make
goods from shoes to tyres, or to extract mineral resources.	
 Indonesia, the world's top exporter of thermal coal and tin
and the biggest producer of palm oil, has benefited from the
rise in many commodity prices.	
 State miner Timah said on Monday tin sales fell 18
percent last year, but profits more than doubled as tin prices
surged to record highs.	
 Investors have bought into Indonesia's growth and reform
story. Although Indonesia does not produce the strongest
economic growth in Asia, it has a massive domestic consumer
market and the president is pressing economic reform.	
 Relatively high interest rates compared to low levels in
developed nations following the end of the global financial
crisis have also helped.	
 Local-currency bonds returned more than 80 percent over the
course of 2009 and 2010 in U.S. dollar terms and the stock
market rose 173 percent over the same period.	
 Indonesia's economic resilience -- it avoided recession
during the global crisis -- and the government's fiscal health
were rewarded in January when Moody's Investors Service raised
its credit rating on the country by one notch and to within one
level of the coveted investment grade.

 * Western investors to remain on sidelines	
 * Sanctions debate keeps focus on Suu Kyi's role	

(Adds details, analyst comment)	
 By Aung Hla Tun	
 YANGON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The party of Myanmar pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Monday that Western sanctions on
the country should remain in place, arguing the embargo affected
the military regime and not the broader population.	
 The announcement by the National League for Democracy (NLD),
Myanmar's biggest opposition force, will be a blow to both the
ruling junta and Western investors keen to tap the isolated
country's vast natural resources.	
 ""We came to find that the sanctions affect only the leaders
of the ruling regime and their close business associates, not
the majority of the people,"" Tin Oo, NLD vice-chairman, told
Reuters.	
 Tin Oo declined to elaborate but said a report by the NLD,
whose 1990 election victory was ignored by the junta, would be
released later on Monday based on its own research and
consultation with economists.	
 Suu Kyi, who was released from house arrest on Nov. 13, has
long backed sanctions as part of her fight against decades of
authoritarian military rule in the former British colony also
known as Burma. The sanctions were intended to force the regime
to improve its poor human rights record and initiate democratic
reforms.	
 But many experts say the policy damaged the economy and hurt
the Burmese people, pushing the generals closer to neighbours
China and Thailand, which are tapping the country's vast energy
reserves.	
 
 Soon after her release, Suu Kyi indicated she might
recommend the lifting of the embargoes, which prompted a flurry
of diplomatic activity and attracted wide attention in the West.	
 
 INVESTMENT CREDENTIALS	
 Around the same time, Myanmar launched a drive to attract
Asian investors, touting its tourism potential and abundant
supplies of gemstones, timber, oil and gas, much of which
remained intact because of ""unfavourable Western sanctions"".	
 Such sanctions have not affected the wealth and lavish
lifestyles of the junta top brass, but they have hampered
efforts to acquire new weapons technology for the military and
have increased dependence on China.	
 Many experts see the sanctions as Suu Kyi's best, and
perhaps only, bargaining chip -- one she might continue to hold
to remain relevant in Myanmar's changing political landscape.	
 While hugely popular and a symbol of hope for the Burmese
people, Suu Kyi and the NLD have no official political role in
Myanmar having boycotted the Nov. 7 election because of strict
election laws. It has since been officially disbanded for
refusing to take part, despite repeated court appeals.	
 A civilian parliament dominated by retired and serving
soldiers convened last week for the first time in five decades
and chose a new president to lead the country
but the old regime is expected to pull the strings, with little
scope for reconciliation or reforms.	
 Experts suggest Suu Kyi could act as a mediator between the
West and the reclusive generals towards easing the sanctions in
return for concrete reforms in the country of 50 million people,
about a third of whom live beneath the poverty line.	
 ""The NLD is popular, but it's facing real problems. They've
been outmanoeuvred by the generals, who have formed a parliament
and government without them,"" said Milton Osbourne, a Southeast
Asia expert at Australia's Lowy Institute think tank.	
 ""The focus on sanction reflects the NLD and Suu Kyi's desire
to be relevant again after being sidelined for so long.""

 * Euro's 3-½ week rally seen hitting wall
 * Aussie takes in stride disappointing retail sales
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The euro recovered a tad on Monday
on Asian buying after lunar new year holidays, though it remained
on shaky ground after a jump in U.S. Treasury yields undermined
its yield advantage.
 With many market players still seen caught in euro long
positions, the euro risks extending a retreat from last week's
12-week high that started after the head of the European Central
Bank sounded less concerned about inflation than many expected.
 A rise in January U.S. payrolls shown in data released on
Friday was much smaller than expected, but traders concluded that
the figure was affected by severe snow storms and instead focused
on a sharp drop in the jobless rate.
 The unemployment rate fell to 9.0 percent in January,
compared to 9.8 percent in November, marking its biggest
two-month decline since 1958.
 While the report is unlikely to prevent the Federal Reserve
from completing its $600 billion government bond-buying programme
to support the economy, signs of underlying strength in the
labour market boosted U.S. bond yields.
 ""I know some people think the jobless rate is unreliable. But
it is one parameter the Fed will be looking at closely,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank.
 The euro rose to $1.3617, up 0.3 percent from U.S. levels
late on Friday, when it fell as low as $1.3543 -- its lowest in
nearly two weeks.
 Major support levels for the euro include $1.3535-40 and
$1.3483, a 38.2 percent retracement of its Jan. 10-Feb. 2 rally.
 Some Asian accounts were buying the euro after the lunar new
year holidays. Mainland China is still on holiday but most other
Asian financial centres resumed trading on Monday.
 But many traders think the euro is likely to lose steam once
follow-up buying has run its course as a jump in U.S. yields
narrowed the euro's yield advantage over the dollar.
 German two-year notes now yield 66 basis points over U.S.
notes, down from a two-year high of 82 basis points late last
month.
 In addition, reports of infighting over a French and German
push for a comprehensive package of reforms to address the euro
zone debt crisis also kept a lid on the euro.
 The apparent rift was a stark reminder of the difficulty of
getting an agreement in the 17-nation currency bloc, even though
traders have grown optimistic in the past few weeks that euro
zone policy-makers will hammer out more steps to counter the debt
crisis by March.
 ""The U.S. has seen a run of solid economic data. On the other
hand, Europe has many things to decide by March. I wouldn't be
surprised if the euro falls to around $1.32 by the end of this
month,"" said Takako Masai, manager of the capital markets
division at Shinsei Bank.
 The euro's fall came after currency speculators raised their
bets on it for the week to Feb. 1 to the most since late October,
meaning it could fall if the market unwinds more of the bets.
 DailyFX strategist David Rodriguez said short-term momentum
may have turned in the dollar's favour.
 ""Of note, the euro/U.S. dollar set a potentially significant
'Evening Star' reversal formation as it failed to hold fresh
multi-month highs on two consecutive trading days and closed
sharply lower on the third,"" he said in a note to clients.
 ""The top question on traders' minds is clear: Is this the
start of a larger euro/U.S. dollar correction? Our technical
strategists certainly think that this may be the spark necessary
to force a major EUR/USD turnaround.""
 The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against
a basket of major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 77.878 but
well off a three-month low of 76.881 plumbed on Wednesday.
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 82.20 yen,
showing little sign of breaking out of its recent trading band
around 82 yen.
 It has a cluster of resistance points around 82.50 yen,
including its 90-day moving average and Ichimoku cloud. Although
some traders think rising U.S. yields could help lift the dollar,
many say the pair seems lacking momentum to clear the resistance
zone.
 The Australian dollar was resilient, dipping only briefly
after surprisingly subdued Australian retail sales data.
 The currency stood at $1.0135, little changed from late U.S
levels but not far from one-month high of $1.0201 hit last
Friday.

 * Euro gains modestly on Asian buying	
 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Asian stocks pushed towards a
near three-year peak on Monday as the U.S. job market showed
further signs of recovery, highlighting a brighter economic
outlook, while the dollar eased against a basket of currencies.	
 South Korea and Japan led gains, with the
former ending up below a record high and the latter closing at a
nine-month peak. .	
 Japan, which is the best performing Asian market this year
with year-to-date gains of more than 3 percent, has benefited
from a shift into developed markets and generally strong
corporate earnings. The index closed up 0.5 percent.	
 South Korea has seen inflows from investors rotating out of
last year's hot performing emerging markets in South and
Southeast Asia due to relatively attractive valuations.	
 The broader MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
was up 0.4 percent to within striking distance
of a three-year peak tested in January.	
 So far this year, Asian stocks have underperformed the MSCI
world index by nearly three percentage points
due to a variety of factors such as frothy valuations in some
markets in South and Southeast Asia and strong data out of the
U.S.	
 Investors pulled out $7 billion from emerging markets equity
funds in the week of Feb. 4, their biggest outflow in three
years, data from fund tracker EPFR Global showed, putting a
sizeable dent in record inflows seen in this category in 2010.	
 But indications that Asian authorities are demonstrating
greater urgency to tackle inflation, with Indonesia being the
latest country to increase interest rates by a quarter point
last week, have made investors optimistic about the near-term
outlook. .	
 ""Policymakers are likely to adopt more administrative
measures and front-load rate hikes as inflationary expectations
continue to rise,"" Barclays Capital strategists said in a note.	
 Most Asian markets which were closed for the Lunar New Year
holiday late last week reopened on Monday with the exception of
China, where trading will not resume until Wednesday.	
 
 DOLLAR DIPS	
 Boosted by Friday's data, which showed a sharp drop in the
U.S. jobless rate, the dollar gained briefly against a basket of
currencies. The dollar index , which tracks the
greenback against a basket of major currencies, had dipped 0.2
percent by midday, nearing a three-month low of 76.881 tested
last Wednesday.	
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.3617 with traders
citing talk of euro-buying by Asian names. . 
 Reports of euro zone infighting over a French and German
push for a comprehensive package of reforms to address the
region's debt crisis also kept a lid on the euro.	
 Indeed, Credit Agricole said many of its Asian clients were
sceptical about any signs of improved sentiment towards the
eurozone's debt troubles.	
 Japanese government bond yields rose, reflecting a rise in
U.S. Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield hitting a
nine-month peak of 1.30 percent. But losses were limited due to
some mild bargain buying. .	
 U.S. crude futures edged above the $89 per barrel
mark, recovering from a 2 percent drop the previous session, due
to the political crisis in Egypt while Brent crude stayed above
the $100 level. .	
 The Egyptian government opened talks with the opposition at
the weekend to try to resolve the country's deepest crisis in 30
years, but it was far from certain the situation had been
defused. (Additional reporting by Ian Chua in SYDNEY and Vikram

 * Reforms could help improve risk assessment, boost forint
 * Monetary policy room of maneuvre may also widen -cbanker
(Adds quotes, background)
 BUDAPEST, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Hungary's fiscal reforms,
expected later this month, could improve risk assessment and
boost the forint, widening the central bank's room of maneuver
in monetary policy, the bank's Governor Andras Simor said on
Sunday.
 ""It is extremely important what that (reform) package will
contain,"" Simor told ATV television. ""It would be good if the
measures reduced spending and not boosted revenues.""
 Simor said the fiscal measures should be sustainable.
 ""If these measures are implemented that can improve
Hungary's risk assessment substantially.""
 ""That ... could widen the room of maneuver for monetary
policy, if you like, not the least because a favourable package
like that would strengthen the forint's exchange rate.""
 The government has said it would table reforms worth
600-800 billion forints ($3 billion-$4 billion) by the end of
this month. Both the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund have said the country needed substantial spending
side reforms. [ID:nLDE71312R] [ID:nLDE7122AH]
 Simor added that the exchange rate of the forint was not
overly strong at the moment, as indicated by annual export
growth of around 20 percent.
 ""In a situation like this, one cannot say the exchange rate
is overly strong and hinders export growth,"" he said.
 The National Bank of Hungary raised the main lending rate
by 25 basis points at each of its last three rate meetings
since November, to 6 percent in January  from a record
low of 5.25 percent last year.
 The government has criticised the rate hikes, saying they
were counter to its pro-growth policies.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban has also said he would have
removed Simor from the helm of the central bank long ago if he
had had the right to do so.
 Asked whether he would resign in the face of government
pressure, Simor said he would fulfill his mandate, which ends
in 2013. He also said that he expected new members of the
rate-setting Monetary Council to resist political pressures.
 A parliamentary committee controlled by the ruling Fidesz
party will nominate all the new rate setters when the mandates
of four of the seven members expire on March 1, as the
government plans to change nomination rules.
 The new members will be in a majority in the council.
 ""The question is why the (nomination rules) are being
changed,"" Simor said. ""Whether this means that the members that
come in arrive with instructions. I trust that whoever comes
will be bound by the central bank law... that they will listen
to forecasts, read the analyses of the staff, and make
decisions based on that.""

 * Spain needs deeper structural reforms
 * Euro not at risk, but cant' ignore market pressure

(Recasts with inflation comments, adds details, quotes)
 By Judy MacInnes
 MADRID, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
have to raise interest rates if the rate of inflation does not
begin to slow by the end of 2011, ECB Executive Board member
Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said.
 ""The ECB is confident that the current uptick in inflation
is temporary, linked to the price of certain raw materials. We
hope it will begin to fall again at the end of the year,""
Gonzalez-Paramo said in an interview with the ABC newspaper on
Sunday.
 ""But if that doesn't happen we will need to raise rates. We
cannot let (inflation) get out of control. The loss of
credibility in anchoring inflation has very serious, negative
consequences,"" he said.
 The ECB left euro zone interest rates at a record low of 1
percent on Thursday and tempered speculation of a near-term rate
hike by saying last month's larger-than-expected inflation jump
had not altered its assessment of medium-term price risks.
 Gonzalez-Paramo ruled out the risk of stagflation in the
eurozone, with the inflation rate running close to 2 percent,
but acknowledged that Spain ""is a situation apart"" as it has to
absorb the impact of a decade-long property boom turning sour.
 ""Spain is looking for a new path. It has to refocus its
resources ... More structural reforms are needed,"" he said.
 While Spain has embarked on a series of structural reforms,
including an overhaul of its labour laws and pension system, the
key to the country's recovery is a reform of collective wage
bargaining.
 ""The key objective is the reform of the collective
bargaining system. The country's recovery lies there and not to
be aware of that is doing the economy no favours,"" Gonzalez
Paramo said.
 Linking salaries to inflation is outdated and ""prevents any
adjustment to the labour market,"" he added.
 Spain's government, unions and employers associations signed
a broad social pact last week on job creation and industrial
development, but left difficult issues such as collective wage
bargaining procedures for future talks. 
 The euro is not at risk, but the market's perception of
some governments' lack of commitment to fiscal obligations
cannot be ignored, Gonzalez-Paramo said.
 ""It's very important to know what the market is thinking,""
he said.

 By Patrick Werr and Sherine El Madany 
 CAIRO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Egypt's Banks opened for the first
time in a week to queues of customers seeking to access their
accounts on Sunday, but the Egyptian pound weakened only
modestly after violent protests gave way to calmer political
talks.
 Bankers had braced for foreign investors and local business
executives to flee the pound  but the currency closed at
5.93 to the dollar, having weakened by about 1.3 percent since
it was last traded on Jan. 27.
 Egypt's AlexBank , a former big state bank that has
been privatised, said after trading it had ended its first open
day with a net cash surplus of 4 million pounds ($674,000).
 ""The way things are looking we do not expect a run on the
pound at the moment,"" Angus Blair, head of research at Beltone
Financial, said. ""We think that the prevailing atmosphere is a
lot calmer than we might have assumed last week. We assumed some
dollarization of the pound but that the system can cope.
 ""I think that each day is seeing an incremental improvement
in stability. If the improvements continue like this, then it
would be a near new normal by the end of the week,"" he said.

 BANK REASSURANCE 
 The pound had weakened to six-year lows in the two days of
trading that followed the first protests on Jan. 25.
 The central bank had sought to reassure investors over
recent days and governor, Farouk el-Okdah, gave a rare
television interview on Saturday night before banks opened.
 ""Of course, over the next week we will have some problems
but we will be able to handle them because we have had
experience before,"" Okdah said. ""I am confident that the market
will be orderly.""
 Since then protesters have been beaten by police and
attacked by supporters of President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo and
across Egypt. Cars and ruling party buildings have been torched.
The army was sent onto the streets to restore order.
 Egypt, once an island of stability in a tumultuous region,
has seen its political establishment shaken to the core.
Mubarak, 82, had been widely expected to run for president again
in September, but has now said he will step down.
 Protesters are still in central Cairo demanding the
president end his 30-year rule now. But violence has subsided
and there was a huge but quiet protest on Friday.
 ""For private investment, I don't think investors will pull
out of Egypt,"" Mona Mansour, an economist at CI Capital, said.
 ""Maybe we'll ... see more outflow from the stock market and
fixed income. We may see also higher T-bill yields. These are
the short-term impacts of this crisis,"" she said.
 The stock market has yet to re-open and a bourse official
said it would stay closed on Tuesday.
 Banks and ATM machines in downtown Cairo have drew long
queues of customers anxious to withdraw money before banks close
after a shortened working day at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT). Some
clients were still anxious despite the relative calm.
 ""I have been visiting several bank branches downtown since
nine in the morning,"" said Soad Mohamed, 62, who wanted to cash
in her pension.
 ""Every bank I go to, they tell me, the bank is closed. I
have one more hour to go before banks close again, and I still
have not been able to withdraw the amount of money I need.""
 Army vehicles still stand guard at intersections where
soldiers had erected sandbag barriers, as buses dropped
employees off at large state banks.
 While clients queued, some employees started taking names to
create lists to ensure order when they enter.
 ""We have to have some order around here. People are anxious
to get paid and pull money out. It has been almost two weeks and
life is at a standstill,"" said Metwali Sha'ban, a volunteer
making a list of customers to organise who would enter first.
 Some 341 bank branches, including 152 in Cairo, were opened
across the country.
 In Tahrir Square, the focal point of nearly two weeks of
protests against Mubarak, soldiers opened the doors of the main
government administrative building, the Mugamma.

(Adds closing exchange rate, trade in government debt) 
 By Patrick Werr and Shaimaa Fayed 
 CAIRO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound fell on Sunday
when trade resumed after a week-long suspension due to political
unrest, but the drop was less sharp than many traders had feared
as the central bank appeared to support the currency. 
 The pound  closed at 5.9300 against the dollar, its
lowest finish since January 2005, compared with 5.8550 when
banks last traded the currency on Jan. 27. 
 Trade was heavy as some foreign investors and Egyptians sent
money out of the country because of the political instability.
Trading volume totalled about $1 billion, double or triple the
normal amount on a Sunday, one dealer estimated. 
 The head of treasury at a Cairo-based bank said there was
heavy dollar-buying, but dollars were being provided by two
local commercial banks which the central bank has traditionally
used to help manage the price of the pound.
 ""We have not had the central bank intervening directly,"" he
said.
 Deputy central bank governor Hisham Ramez indicated last
week that the central bank, which had $36 billion of official
foreign reserves at end-December, did not want to see a sharp
fall of the pound.
 ""We don't comment on currency matters, but this will not
happen,"" he told Reuters.
 
 PRESSURE MAY GROW 
 Currency traders said pressure on the pound could grow more
acute on Monday when banks outside the Middle East opened after
the weekend.
 ""People are trying to get out. There will be more tomorrow,
when I think we're going to test 6.00,"" a London-based trader
said.
 Hisham Ezz al-Arab, chairman of Commercial International
Bank , Egypt's biggest private bank, said the central
bank was focused more on providing liquidity to the market than
on maintaining the value of the pound.
 ""The main objective of the central bank or the market makers
is to make sure there is liquidity,"" he told al Arabiya
television. ""The price is not the objective.""
 UBS Investment Research predicted on Friday that the pound
could fall by as much as 25 percent within a month, which would
put it well below 7.00 against the dollar. Credit Agricole
suggested on Thursday that the pound could drop 20 percent ""over
the short term"".
 The non-deliverable forwards market has been showing
increasing expectations for long-term depreciation of the pound;
one-year forwards  were at 6.63 late last week,
compared to levels around 6.25 in mid-January.
 Some traders think the pound may stabilise after a few days,
however. A Dubai-based trader said he was expecting about $7
billion to $9 billion to flow out of Egypt over time as a result
of the political unrest, which the central bank could handle
fairly comfortably given the size of its reserves.
 The risk to the pound is a much greater-than-expected
outflow of money, which could occur if the political crisis
drags on, he said.

 GOVERNMENT DEBT
 A fresh test of market confidence in Egypt will come on
Monday when the central bank is due to auction 15 billion
Egyptian pounds ($2.6 billion) of short-term Treasury bills,
after being forced to cancel auctions last week.
 Some Egyptian banks are expected to buy the bills to back
the government's efforts to stabilise the financial system, but
it is unclear whether foreign banks will buy. Any substantial
foreign interest in the bills could help to support the pound.
 Dealers said secondary market trade in government debt was
very light on Sunday because of the political uncertainty, with
offers of bills by foreign investors finding few buyers.
 ""We have no idea where the rates are going to be on Monday,""
a fixed income dealer at a Cairo bank said. Most banks were
having problems calculating their reserves, which made it hard
for them to judge how many T-bills they should buy, he added.
 Banks had not yet settled many transfers and debt market
trades made in the two frantic days before they were closed down
by the political protests. ""They must see where they stand.""

(Updates with U.S. markets close)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose and
Treasury yields broke above key levels on Friday as investors
remained confident in the U.S. economic recovery despite
conflicting messages from a key jobs report for January.
 Global stocks posted limited gains as major indexes hit
resistance after a prolonged rally. Still, the S&P 500 closed
at a 2-1/2-year high and had its best week in nine.
 U.S. crude oil prices fell nearly $2 in volatile trade on
talk that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was about to step
down. The speculation was based on a television report that
later appeared to be unfounded, but oil prices, which had been
rising this week on the unrest in Egypt, remained lower.
 The euro fell about 0.3 percent while long Treasury bonds
lost more than one point in price as the U.S. nonfarm payrolls
data did not fundamentally change investors' view that the
world's largest economy is recovering but more monetary
stimulus is needed.
 The Labor Department reported U.S. employers added only
36,000 jobs in January as severe snow storms slammed large
parts of the country, but the unemployment rate fell to 9.0
percent, the lowest level since April 2009.
 The job gains were only one quarter of the 145,000
economists had expected, but the jobless rate was better than
the forecast that it would tick up to 9.5 percent. For details,
see [ID:nN0366997].
 ""The employment report is stronger than the headline as
weather probably damped it,"" said Bret Barker, portfolio
manager with the TCW Group. ""This is true especially when you
contrast it to the other employment data points we are seeing
in the PMIs and jobless claims.""
 Tom Bentz, a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in
New York, said markets were being kept on edge by events in
Egypt. ""Markets are still concerned about Egypt unrest
continuing. Traders may still be concerned about being short
ahead of the weekend."" he said.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3546  on trading
platform EBS, below a key support level of $1.3570. It last
traded at 1.3584, 0.34 percent lower.
 The dollar also gained against other major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.38 percent. Against the
Japanese yen , the greenback strengthened 0.77 percent to
82.22.
 ""The drop in the jobless rate is a surprise and the dollar
is rallying on this,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""Yields are moving up and
while job creation not where people want it to be, the feeling
is there is an underlying momentum there.""
 Traders said the fall in the euro through the key support
level of $1.3570 suggested that a three-week rally in the
single currency may be showing signs of exhaustion.
 ""We haven't seen a three-day slide since the euro's January
rally began, and it was looking overbought this week, so we
seem to be in correction mode,"" said BNP Paribas technical
strategist Andrew Chaveriat. He said the euro could test $1.35
in coming days and $1.3250-$1.3350 over the next few weeks.
 Investors also dumped U.S. Treasury bonds after the jobs
report, sending yields on long bonds to a near 10-month high.
 Prices of 30-year bonds  fell 34/32, sending
yields to 4.7359 percent, their highest since last April 15.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 25/32 in
price, with the yield at 3.6457 percent.
 The jump in Treasury yields increased fears that U.S.
mortgage rates could rise toward 5 percent and further weigh on
the struggling U.S. housing market.
 STOCKS RALLY COOLS DOWN
 World stocks posted small gains as investors preferred not
to take on large positions in face of continuous unrest in
Egypt. [ID:nLDE713009]
 MSCI's All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> edged 0.13
percent higher, while its benchmark emerging market index
<.MSCIEF> dipped 0.2 percent.
 The major Wall Street indexes rose moderately as investors
rotated into defensive and lagging sectors, while taking some
profits in energy, materials, and industrials.
 ""The market has been getting more selective and the
rotation is important,"" said Wayne Kaufman, chief market
analyst at John Thomas Financial in New York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 29.89
points, or 0.25 percent, at 12,092.15, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> finished up 3.77 points, or 0.29
percent, at 1,310.87. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose
15.42 points, or 0.56 percent, at 2,769.30.
 For the week, the Dow rose 2.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained
2.7 percent, and the Nasdaq climbed 3.1 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading
shares closed 0.23 percent higher, supported by construction
stocks.
 U.S. crude oil prices fell $1.51 to $89.03 a barrel as the
speculation on Mubarak's resignation sparked profit-taking,
from which the market failed to recover even after the
speculation proved unfounded.
 ""The expectation that some resolution was coming flushed a
lot of length out of the market,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst
at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Oil prices were also pressured by the strength of the
dollar, which makes the commodity more expensive for non-U.S.
investors.
 Optimism about the global economic recovery drove copper
prices above $10,000 a tonne. Contracts for delivery in three
months on the London Metal Exchange  closed at $10,050 a
tonne, after reaching a record-high $10,100.

 NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the

by higher Treasury yields after a sharp drop in the U.S.
jobless rate brightened the outlook for the U.S. economy.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3543 on trading platform EBS on
Friday, retreating further from a nearly three-month high at

showing signs of exhaustion.

 The euro was last down 0.3 percent at $1.3585 ,

 By John McCrank
 TORONTO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar powered to
its highest level against the U.S. dollar since May 2008 on
Friday after data showed that Canada produced far more jobs
than expected in January, while U.S. job gains were tepid.
 The currency rose as high as C$0.9832 to the U.S. dollar,
or $1.0171 after Statistics Canada said the economy added
69,200 new positions, more than quadruple the 15,000 that
markets had expected. [ID:nN04174016]
 The unemployment rate, which had been forecast to remain
unchanged, grew to 7.8 percent from 7.6 percent as more people
entered the workforce.
 In the United States, the data showed a rise of 36,000 jobs
in January, far less than the 145,000 increase the market had
expected, but the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level
since April 2009.
 The contrast was key to the Canadian dollar's
outperformance of its U.S. counterpart, said David Watt, senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""It took a fairly startling jobs number in order to beat
the U.S. dollar, but we did manage to be the only currency to
beat the U.S. dollar today,"" he said.
 The Canadian dollar  closed at C$0.9884 to the U.S.
dollar, or $1.0112. That was up from Thursday's North American
close at C$0.9910 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0091.
 The modest U.S. jobs gain was at odds with other U.S. data
for January, which had suggested employment growth was picking
up, but severe snow storms that slammed large parts of the
country may have been partly to blame for the weak figure.
[ID:nLLA4DE7BA]
 The weak U.S. headline number did not have a deep impact on
the U.S. dollar, which allowed the Canadian dollar to
strengthen on the back of Canada's own set of job figures and
outperform all the other major currencies, said Camilla Sutton,
chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 BONDS FALL
 The strong Canadian data and the big drop in the U.S.
unemployment rate fueled economic recovery hopes, weakening
demand for safe-haven government debt and keeping Canadian bond
prices in the red.
 ""The data raises the risk that the Bank of Canada could
resume raising interest rates sooner than expected,"" said Sal
Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 Both Guatieri and RBC's Watt said that while that risk had
increased, it was unlikely the central bank would move on rates
in the near term.
 The bank has said its main concerns regarding Canada's
economic recovery are related to soft Canadian productivity,
lackluster U.S. demand, and the strong Canadian dollar, said
Watt.
 ""Well, it takes time for the productivity to change, the
U.S. situation still remains challenging, and the Canadian
dollar is still above parity,"" he said. ""So I don't think the
Bank of Canada is necessarily going to change how it is
approaching monetary policy.""
 The two-year bond  shed 17 Canadian cents to
yield 1.857 percent, while the 10-year bond  dropped
32 Canadian cents to yield 3.464 percent.

 By Maria Jose Latorre and Michael O'Boyle
 SANTIAGO/MEXICO CITY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Chile's peso hit a
one-month high on Friday, daring policymakers who are worried
about its strength, while Mexico's peso broke a key level after
central bank minutes showed few worries about its gains.
 Brazil's real, meanwhile, slipped on a sharp stock market
sell-off and the central bank's daily dollar purchases.
 Chile's peso  firmed 0.17 percent to 478.80 per
dollar as copper, the country's main export, posted yet another
record high.
 The country's currency has more than halved its losses
since the beginning of January, when the central bank knocked
the peso back from a nearly three-year high with the start of a
$12 billion intervention program.
 The Chilean peso has been steadily appreciating, boosted by
copper prices and expectations that the central bank will need
to raise interest rates to fight surging inflation
expectations.
 ""The exchange rate is following its fundamentals,
specifically copper and an expected benchmark rate hike this
month,"" said a trader.
 Bets in favor of the peso are rising in the non-deliverable
forwards market, the preferred vehicle for major foreign
players who want to take a position on Chile's currency.
[ID:nN04186082]
 NO WORRIES IN MEXICO
 Mexico's peso firmed 0.25 percent to 11.9760 per dollar,
breaking past the key 12-per-dollar level.
 The currency has struggled to definitively break the
12-per-dollar level since firming past that for the first time
in nearly 2-1/2 years last month.
 Aiding the peso, Mexico's central bank did not signal alarm
about recent peso gains in minutes published on Friday but
noted that peso volatility has diminished as foreign investors
take long-term positions in the currency. [ID:nN04186082]
 Mexico's peso has lagged the gains of other emerging market
currencies, hurt last year by fears of a double-dip U.S.
recession, and that has given policymakers more room. Moreover,
the peso's strength is helping curb the inflationary pressures
of international commodity prices.
 ""Mexico clearly stands in contrast to the rest of the
region, where the central bank depends upon a stronger FX in
containing inflation pressures as opposed to concerns of
currency strength feeding further into domestic demand,"" wrote
analysts at RBS Securities, who expect the peso to keep gaining
ground against the dollar.
 The Brazilian real  was down 0.36 percent at 1.674
per dollar in the local spot market.
 The greenback traded higher against a basket of major
currencies <.DXY> after the U.S. January jobs report
underpinned optimism that the economy's recovery is on track,
even though job growth was much lower than forecast.
 The fall in the real was driven by a slump in the stock
market and efforts by the central bank to limit the currency's
gains. The central bank earlier sold $706.7 million worth of
reserve currency swap contracts, less than the amount on offer.
[ID:nN04178765].
 ""We are seeing (foreign investors) getting out of the stock
market ... that affects the dollar,"" said Luiz Eduardo
Portella, a fixed-income and currency trader at Banco Modal in
Sao Paulo. ""They are getting out of markets where inflation is
getting out of control.""
 Brazil's 12-month inflation in the month to mid-January
rose 6.04 percent, at the top end of a government target range.
Analysts will get the full index for January next week.

 NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro on Friday after the U.S. jobless rate fell to its lowest
level in nearly two years, and traders said a brightening U.S.
economic outlook may help it extend gains in the weeks ahead.

 The euro peaked this week at $1.3862, the highest in nearly
three months, but slid after the European Central Bank cooled
expectations for a near-term hike in euro zone interest rates.
 BNP Paribas technical strategist Andrew Chaveriat, adding
the euro could test $1.35 in coming days and $1.3250-$1.3350

 Recent U.S. data, capped by the jobless rate's slide to 9
percent from 9.4 percent, pushed up U.S. yields and had markets

 LONG-TERM EURO OUTLOOK BRIGHTER

the euro had climbed nearly 8 percent by mid-week, partly on
the view the ECB would lift interest rates before the Fed.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet dashed those expectations

and service sector activity, some analysts say the market may

 By Jan Strupczewski and Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Germany and France tried to win
backing for a pact to strengthen the euro zone economy on
Friday, but many other EU states were angered by what they saw
as a 'fait accompli' and the measures contained in it.
 Paris and Berlin -- the driving forces behind euro zone
policy -- set out a wish-list of measures they want euro zone
and the wider EU to adopt to improve competitiveness and help
tackle the year-long debt crisis. The proposals included:
 * limits on debt levels written into national laws
 * a higher retirement age, based on demography
 * the abolition of wages indexed to inflation
 * unified bank crisis-resolution mechanisms, and
 * a minimum corporate tax rate
 But there was almost immediate pushback against the
proposals, with large and small EU states, from Belgium and
Austria to Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Poland and Luxembourg
expressing aggravation at France and Germany's methods, as well
as the substance of the six-point proposal.
 ""The discussion became really quite heated,"" said an EU
diplomat on the sidelines of the talks. ""One EU leader asked
Sarkozy and Merkel if they really thought it was right to treat
everyone else in this way. He was insulted.""

 BREAKINGVIEWS column on French debt brake [ID:nLDE7120QJ]
 
 Paris and Berlin said they had worked together to come up
with a clear package quickly. French President Nicolas Sarkozy
said the two had no intention of enforcing a straightjacket.
 ""The idea we have with Angela Merkel is not to impose the
same thing to everybody ... but maybe we can agree on how to
calculate things,"" he told reporters after the summit.
 ""Maybe we can agree on a commom framework, which does not
mean pure equality,"" he said of the proposal for a corporate
taxation minimum. ""It's not a rigid process.""
 Merkel said the intention was to show unity and
determination on tackling the causes of the debt crisis.
 ""We want to send out a clear message, that as the European
Union, we intend to grow together. What we want to establish is
a pact for competitiveness,"" she said.
 Opponents, which included a good portion of the 17 countries
in the euro zone, said the proposals were hard to accept.
 ""I don't think it's possible for the European Union to
regulate the pension age because there are large differences in
the individual countries,"" Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann
said. ""I don't think it's right to interfere in wage
negotiations, like some have demanded.""
 Ireland opposes a minimum corporate tax rate, Belgium, Spain
and Portugal oppose the abolition of index-linked wage
increases, and the retirement age measure is widely disliked in
countries with strong unions and powerful labour lobbies.
 The issue is likely to be taken up again at an extra summit
after March 9, Germany said, with the aim still to try to forge
an agreement by the end of next month.
 
 PUSHBACK
 Most of the proposals by Berlin and Paris have already been
set out by the European Commission in January in its Annual
Growth Survey, part of the new, tighter budget process.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso signalled
on Wednesday there was no need for separate agreements between
governments on more economic cooperation since the same could be
done on the basis of the Commission proposal.
 But France and Germany hope a deal between governments will
ensure an agreement is reached more quickly -- an important
factor given the pressing nature of the debt crisis.
 The two biggest euro zone economies want the pact to be part
of a ""comprehensive package"" that leaders agree in March, when
they hope to sign off on a series of measures that might help
halt the euro zone's year-long sovereign debt crisis.
 The package is to include changes to the European Financial
Stability Facility, the 440 billion euro bailout fund agreed
last May, to increase its effective lending capacity and give it
more flexibility on how to use its money. [ID:nLDE7101AC]
 Conclusions of the summit said euro zone ministers would
consider proposals for strengthening the EFSF ""to ensure the
necessary effectiveness to provide adequate support"". Those
discussions are also expected to be finalized next month.
 Strengthening the EFSF has been the focus of discussion for
months, since it became clear its effective lending capacity was
only about 250 billion euros, not 440 billion, due to guarantees
built into the fund to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 Given its lending limitations, there are concerns that if
Portugal and Spain were both to end up needing a bailout, the
EFSF would not have sufficient funds. 
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, who
held talks with EU leaders over lunch, is among those calling
for the EFSF to be enlarged and made more flexible, so that it
is not just a bailout lender of last resort.
 The EFSF is the chief weapon in the EU's arsenal, but deep
disagreement remains over how it should be strengthened, with
Germany determined to secure stricter budgetary commitments from
other euro zone members and reforms boosting competitiveness in
exchange for agreeing amendments to the fund.

 * Addresses rich country demands, but asks them to do more
 * U.S. trade official says proposal not ambitious enough
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday
rejected a Mexican government proposal to break the deadlock in
long-stalled world trade talks, saying it failed to achieve the
amount of new market opening needed for a deal.
 Trade ministers agreed last week to push for an outline
deal in the decade-old talks by July, and instruct their
negotiators at World Trade Organization headquarters in Geneva
to make the necessary compromises to reach an agreement.
 Mexico's proposal attempts to tackle the fundamental divide
in the talks -- the call by rich countries for a more
far-reaching deal than is now on the table versus the demand by
poorer countries that a deal primarily promotes development.
 ""We appreciate the active engagement, but our analysis of
Mexico's approach is that it will not address the central issue
of ambition,"" a U.S. trade official told Reuters.
 That ""cannot be resolved through blanket prescriptions, or
over-arching formulaic solutions,"" the aide added.
 ""There is simply no substitute for WTO Members sitting
across the table and negotiating with one another. Shortcuts
all lead to dead ends,"" the aide said.
 The United States and European Union want emerging
economies to open up their markets more than so far proposed,
while developing countries want advanced economies to make a
bigger contribution to the deal than they do.
 Since it is already agreed in principle that the world's
poorest countries would not have to make concessions, the
difference is between rich and fast-emerging economies like
Brazil, China, India, South Africa and Thailand.
 Some economists say a Doha deal could inject hundreds of
billions of dollars into the world economy. It would also boost
business sentiment and bolster defenses against protectionism.
 While the nine-year-long negotiations have prompted yawns
and scepticism in the past, businesses are paying increasing
attention. The law firm King & Spalding issued a note to
clients on Thursday urging them to review how a deal could
affect them.
 TRADE-OFFS
 Mexico's proposal, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters,
would require rich countries to do more to open their markets
than developing countries.
 It looks to open up a whole range of markets, from farming
and industrial goods to services, allowing negotiators to make
trade-offs across the board.
 For instance one country may be willing to make deeper cuts
in industrial tariffs if it sees its partner going the extra
mile on farm import duties.
 ""In the market access areas progress has been quite
limited,"" Mexican Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari told trade
ministers in the Swiss resort of Davos on Jan. 29, according to
a participant in the meeting.
 ""So the question is if we are going to be able to create a
shortcut towards a simultaneous solution for all market access
issues,"" he was quoted as saying.
 A Doha agreement may be quite different to Mexico's
proposal in the end, but it is certain to involve this kind of
trade-off across different sectors, known in the jargon as
horizontal negotiations.
 And once questions of market access are dealt with, other
problems such as cutting subsidies or improving rules for
unfairly priced imports will fall into place, Ferrari said.

 (Refiles to recast headline)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - European Union institutions and
smaller EU states voiced frustration on Friday over a
Franco-German 'fait accompli' on beefing up the euro zone
economy, suggesting it rode roughshod over the bloc's guiding
principles.
 Paris and Berlin jointly proposed a competitiveness pact for
European governments, including debt rules in national
constitutions, higher retirement ages, a minimum corporate tax
and the abolition of wage indexation, among other ideas.
 It was the second time in recent summits that France and
Germany -- the bloc's biggest and most influential economies --
have agreed a joint position ahead of the meeting, expecting the
rest of the euro zone and wider EU to tag along.
 ""A lot of countries have very big difficulties with the
proposals,"" said a diplomat from a smaller euro zone state. ""But
we cannot now say that we are against the Franco-German proposal
because that would send the wrong signal to markets.""
 Several east European and peripheral euro zone states
quietly expressed their irritation, and the European parliament
issued a statement decrying the Franco-German approach.
 ""I found it astounding that two of the most committed and
founding members of the European Union are determined on taking
this intergovernmental approach to saving the euro,"" Sharon
Bowles, the head of the economic and monetary affairs committee
of the parliament, said in a statement.
 ""We must ensure that the Commission is at the heart of the
system and fully politically accountable to the parliament. Only
then will we be able to prevent the political trade-offs and
back scratching between member states, which led Europe directly
into this crisis in the first place,"" she said.
 An adviser to French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Paris
had every intention of keeping the European Commission, the EU
executive, involved in the process.
 
 FRANCO-GERMAN DEAL
 The competitiveness pact is viewed as part of the euro
zone's plan to win back the confidence of markets, and the price
Germany wants to extract from others in exchange for agreeing to
strengthen the euro zone's bailout fund, the EFSF.
 Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso expressed concern
that EU institutions were being sidelined in the process even
before France and Germany presented their proposal on Friday.
 ""Establishing a system of reinforced economic governance for
the EU, and in particular the euro area outside the union
framework raises important, and politically very sensitive,
questions,"" Barroso told parliament on Wednesday.
 ""We need, and we have been in favour of, more policy
coordination, better economic governance, but we have to do it
in a way that is coherent and compatible with the treaties and
with the community approach,"" he said.
 Laws in the EU can be proposed by governments, with binding
actions agreed on by heads of state and government. The European
parliament is consulted in the process in what is called the
inter-governmental method.
 The pact put forward by France and Germany is similar to
proposals made by the European Commission in January in its
annual growth survey, which is part of the new, tighter
budgetary and economic policy coordination process.
 But instead of developing the Commission proposal, Paris and
Berlin chose to submit their own, because a deal between
governments may often be readied more quickly.
 ""Merkel and Sarkozy should bear in mind that we are not
working to their agenda or proposals but on what comes from the
Commission. We will not rubber stamp anything which fails to
address the underlying causes of the crisis, namely the weak
fiscal discipline of previous years,"" Bowles said.

 * U.S. adds only 36,000 jobs but unemployment rate falls
 * Investor view on U.S. recovery unchanged after jobs data
 * Crude oil prices fall on Egypt speculation
(Updates with European markets close)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose and
Treasury yields broke above key levels on Friday after the U.S.
January jobs report underpinned optimism that the economy
recovery is on track, even though job gains missed forecasts.
 Global stocks were little changed, as major indexes hit
resistance after a recent prolonged rally.
 Oil prices were volatile, with U.S. crude futures falling
more than $2 on talk that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was
about to step down. The speculation was based on a television
report that later appeared to be unfounded, though crude
prices, which had been rising this week on the unrest in Egypt,
remained lower.
 The euro fell about 0.4 percent while long Treasury bonds
lost more than one point in price as the U.S. nonfarm payrolls
report for January did not fundamentally change investors' view
that the world's largest economy is recovering but more
monetary stimulus is needed.
 The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added
only 36,000 jobs in January as severe snow storms slammed large
parts of the country, but the unemployment rate fell to 9.0
percent, the lowest level since April 2009. The job gains were
only one quarter of the 145,000 economists had expected, but
the jobless rate was better than the forecast that it would
tick up to 9.5 percent. For details, see [ID:nN0366997].
 ""The employment report is stronger than the headline as
weather probably damped it,"" said Bret Barker, portfolio
manager with the TCW Group. ""This is true especially when you
contrast it to the other employment data points we are seeing
in the PMIs and jobless claims.""
 Tom Bentz, a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in
New York, said markets were being kept on edge by events in
Egypt. ""Markets are still concerned about Egypt unrest
continuing. Traders may still be concerned about being short
ahead of the weekend."" he said.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3546  on trading
platform EBS, below a key support level of $1.3570. It last
traded at 1.3572, 0.43 percent lower.
 The dollar also gained against other major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.5 percent. Against the
Japanese yen , the greenback strengthened 0.72 percent to
82.18.
 ""The drop in the jobless rate is a surprise and the dollar
is rallying on this,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""Yields are moving up and
while job creation not where people want it to be, the feeling
is there is an underlying momentum there.""
 Traders also said the fall in the euro through the key
support level of $1.3570 suggested that a three-week rally in
the single currency may be showing signs of exhaustion.
 ""We haven't seen a three-day slide since the euro's January
rally began, and it was looking overbought this week, so we
seem to be in correction mode,"" said BNP Paribas technical
strategist Andrew Chaveriat. He said the euro could test $1.35
in coming days and $1.3250-$1.3350 over the next few weeks.
 Investors also dumped U.S. Treasury bonds after the jobs
report, sending yields on long bonds to a near 10-month high.
 Prices of 30-year bonds  fell 35/32, sending
yields to 4.7369 percent, their highest since April 15, 2010.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 29/32 in
price, with the yield at 3.6638 percent.
 The jump in Treasury yields increased fears that U.S.
mortgage rates could rise toward 5 percent and further weigh on
the struggling U.S. housing market.
 World stocks were little changed as investors preferred not
to take on large positions in face of continuous unrest in
Egypt. [ID:nLDE713009]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 13.97
points, or 0.12 percent, at 12,048.29, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> dipped 2.00 points, or 0.15 percent, to
1,305.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was nearly flat at
2,755.39.
 Major indexes faced resistance after the Dow opened above
the 12,000 mark for a third consecutive day.
 ""Despite the general bullishness in the market, we've been
trading sideways for a while"" because the market needs a small
pullback to move beyond the technical ranges, said James
Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading
shares closed 0.23 percent higher, supported by construction
stocks.
 MSCI's All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
practically unchanged at 340.8 points, while its benchmark
emerging market index <.MSCIEF> was 0.2 percent lower.
 U.S. crude oil prices fell in volatile trade after the
jobs report, with the confusing data initially drawing negative
responses by various markets. Crude prices fell further with
speculation on events in Egypt.
 ""Traders are liquidating crude futures in anticipation of a
possible announcement from Egypt about Mubarak,"" said Tom
Knight, trader at Truman Arnold in Texarkana, Texas. ""The
market is assuming that Mubarak is leaving and that the
demonstrations will end.""
 Phil FLynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago, noting
the rumors that Mubarak was about to step down, said, ""But this
isn't the first time we've heard these rumors, and we're not
sure if he's leaving or not.""
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, March crude 
fell more than $2 before paring gains. It last traded down
$1.72, or 1.9 percent, at $88.82 per barrel.
 Optimism about the global economic recovery drove copper
prices above $10,000 a tonne. Contracts for delivery in three
months on the London Metal Exchange  closed at $10,050 a
tonne, after reaching a record-high $10,100.

(Adds new quotes from Huawei)
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The European Union will drop its
inquiry into whether China is giving illegal aid to two of its
leading telecom firms, even as the EU's executive cites evidence
of massive subsidies, according to EU Commission documents.
 The Commission will propose ending two investigations into
illegal export pricing by and state aid to Chinese wireless
modem producers after the withdrawal of the complaint by
Europe's main producer, Belgium's Option, late last year,
according to a confidential document seen by Reuters.
 The proposal is expected to be approved by European Union
governments later this month, ending a case industry players had
expected to be a litmus test of the EU's willingness to
challenge Chinese state subsidies.
 ""It would be disproportionate to continue with the
investigation and impose measures following the withdrawal of
the complaint,"" the Commission said in its document, which was
distributed on Tuesday to interested parties in the case.
 But in a separate document also dated Tuesday and
distributed to EU governments, the Commission cites evidence --
gathered since last summer -- that China's main telecom
producers Huawei and ZTE are state-controlled and receive cheap
state loans that give them an unfair advantage over their
European rivals.
 ""We continue to reject any allegations of illegal subsidies.
Huawei is a 100 percent staff-owned company and has no link to
any government. Huawei's customers get their financing from a
range of banks at market rates,"" said Tim Watkins, Huawei's Vice
President for the West EU Region.
 ZTE has also denied receiving state aid, but could not be
reached for comment.
 There was no comment from the Commission.
 Option dropped its complaints of Chinese subsidies and
export dumping after it reached a cooperation agreement with
Huawei in October.
 
 AID ALLEGATIONS
 According to the Commission, ZTE received credit lines of
$15 billion from the China Development Bank and $10 billion from
the China Export-Import Bank in 2009.
 ""Such facilities are a major selling point, which enables
ZTE to clinch deals in its export markets ahead of its
competitors such as Option in Belgium, while shifting the
entirety or majority of its risk of payment onto the Chinese
policy banks,"" the document says.
 ""Huawei also benefited from similar massive financing
facilities"", including a $30 billion credit line from the China
Development Bank, the document says, adding: ""This suggests
significant state interference.""
 Bill Plummer, Vice President of External Affairs for Huawei
USA, told Reuters that China's financing went to customers
buying Huawei equipment -- not the company itself -- and that
this practice complied with OECD standards.
 ""It was a miniscule fraction of our business. To suggest we
succeeded because of that flies in the face of the facts. We
succeeded because we invested in research and development,""
Plummer said.
 The Commission's findings also include allegations that ZTE
and Huawei are still influenced by the state.
 Beyond wireless modem manufacturing, the growth of Huawei
and ZTE in other sectors has worried European telecoms hardware
and network infrastructure producers such as Ericsson, Nokia
Siemens Networks and Alcatel-Lucent.
 It has also worried policy makers who fear China is
encroaching on high-tech sectors hitherto dominated by Europe.
Europe's chief trade negotiator last year vowed to face down
illegal state subsidies outside the EU, accusing China of
subsidising ""nearly everything"".

(Updates prices, adds detail, comment)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro on Friday after the U.S. jobless rate fell to its lowest
level in nearly two years, and traders said a brightening U.S.
economic outlook may help it extend gains in the weeks ahead.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3544, and traders said a break
through firm support at $1.3570 suggested a three-week euro
rally may be showing signs of exhaustion.
 The euro was last 0.4 percent lower at $1.3577, headed for
its first three-day decline in more than a month.
 ""We haven't seen a three-day slide since the euro's January
rally began, and it was looking overbought this week, so we
seem to be in correction mode,"" said BNP Paribas technical
strategist Andrew Chaveriat, adding the euro could test $1.35
in coming days and $1.3250-$1.3350 over the next few weeks.
 The euro peaked this week at $1.3862, the highest in nearly
three months, but slid after the European Central Bank cooled
expectations for a near-term hike in euro zone interest rates.
 Recent U.S. data, capped by the jobless rate's slide to 9
percent from 9.4 percent, pushed up U.S. yields and had markets
pricing in a two-in-three chance of a U.S. rate hike by year
end, up from one in three a week ago.
 With the rate differential shifting in the dollar's favor,
the greenback also rose 0.4 percent to 81.99 yen and 1.1
percent to 0.9555 Swiss francs.
 ""Yields are moving up, and while job creation is not where
people want it to be, the feeling is there is an underlying
momentum,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey. ""The dollar has moved higher on that.""
 Trading on electronic trading platform EBS posted an
unofficial volume record with 2,990 foreign exchange trades
recorded in the minute after the release of the jobs data. Some
12,000 deals were recorded in the 10 minutes after the release.
Records become official 24 hours after they're set.
 If the euro closes below $1.3570, Dolan said a move to
$1.33 was possible in the weeks ahead. The next downside target
was around $1.3526, the 100-day simple moving average.
 LONG-TERM EURO OUTLOOK BRIGHTER
 After hitting a four-month low beneath $1.29 on Jan. 10,
the euro had climbed nearly 8 percent by mid-week, partly on
the view the ECB would lift interest rates before the Fed.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet dashed those expectations
on Thursday, saying euro zone inflation expectations remains
well anchored.
 The Federal Reserve, however, has also remained dovish, and
Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated this week that the economy
remained fragile.
 Despite recent stronger-than-expected data on U.S. factory
and service sector activity, some analysts say the market may
be getting ahead of itself. Dan Cook, senior analyst at IG
Markets in Chicago, noted U.S. employers added a paltry 36,000
jobs in January, though bad weather may have had an impact.
 ""These numbers are not supportive of the dollar,"" he said.
""They mean the Fed is going to stay around. Look for some
profit-taking.""
 Traders from one large investment bank reported only modest
selling of bullish euro-dollar and euro-yen option structures
on Friday, suggesting the longer-term view remains bullish.
 Investors have grown less anxious about Europe's ability to
handle a sovereign debt crisis, and EU policymakers on Friday
discussed bolstering a rescue fund for indebted member
countries.
 In a note to clients, Dan Dorrow, head of research at
Stamford, Connecticut-based FX execution firm Faros Trading,
said central bank efforts to rebalance dollar-heavy portfolios
will ensure a large and reliable bid for the euro.

 * 2,400 work at Sandwich site, where Viagra was discovered
 
 LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Pfizer faces a grilling from
British lawmakers, who want an explanation for its decision this
week to shutter a giant research and development centre in
Sandwich, southern England, which employs 2,400 people.
 The parliamentary Science and Technology Committee said on
Friday it planned to take oral evidence from representatives of
the world's biggest drugmaker, as well as Britain's science
minister David Willetts.
 Pfizer's decision to quit the research site where Viagra was
discovered is a major setback for Britain, which has a long
history as a centre of drug development.
 Committee chairman Andrew Miller MP said the move
was ""deeply worrying"" and members of parliament had urgent
questions that needed answering.
 ""It is not only a cruel blow for the Pfizer employees --
many are highly skilled -- but it also raises questions about UK
Plc's ability to use science to drive the economy,"" he said in a
statement.
 Pfizer, which is exiting Sandwich over the next 18-24 months
as part of a global drive to rationalise its research,
said the majority of staff would be made redundant, although
some might find work at other Pfizer sites.
 Sandwich is Pfizer's biggest R&D facility in Europe and the
largest R&D site of any foreign-owned drugmaker in Britain. It
has been a base for drug discovery for the U.S.-based group
since 1954.
 Researchers at Pfizer's Sandwich site, which resembles a
university campus, have been responsible for discovering several
high-profile Pfizer products, including impotence pill Viagra,
heart drug Norvasc and HIV/AIDS medicine Celsentri.
 Britain has traditionally punched above its weight in drug
research, but it has already been hit in the past year by other
planned research cuts at British-based AstraZeneca and
GlaxoSmithKline.

 By Nia Williams
 LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A recent sharp tightening in
peripheral yield spreads over German Bunds, driven by talk of
reforming the euro zone financial rescue fund, could quickly
unwind if policymakers fail to turn their words into action.
 Spanish, Italian and Greek spreads narrowed this week to
their tightest since October, helped by whispers of Germany
accepting that the European Financial Stability Facility would
need to be expanded to draw a line under the year-long euro zone
debt crisis.
 Proposals to discuss economic policy coordination at a
European Union summit on Friday, with a view to ironing out
differences on how to reform the $440 billion EFSF fund, are the
strongest signals yet that a revamp is on the agenda.
 But until those proposals are translated into policy, most
likely at the March 25 EU summit deadline promised by German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, peripheral spread tightening should be
viewed with caution, analysts said.
 ""The market is giving officials the benefit of the doubt.
But if we don't get a resolution in March there will be all hell
to pay,"" said Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham
Stockbrokers.
 ""We can't take anything for granted. We've a had a good run
but it wouldn't take much to cause consternation and push yields
higher again. If this turns out to be just more talk it could
ultimately push Portugal over the edge.""
 Although statements from German and French policymakers have
mostly been positive for the periphery, unnamed officials in
Berlin spoke against the EFSF being allowed to buy bonds as
recently as Wednesday.
 The accompanying flare-out in peripheral spreads, albeit
short-lived, served as a reminder that positive sentiment is
still precarious in the crisis and EU policymakers cannot afford
to over-promise and under-deliver.
 ""For the last 12 months the market has been buying the
rumour and selling the fact,"" said Kenneth Broux, market
economist at Lloyds Bank.
 ""Efforts to resolve the crisis so far have been like
sticking a temporary plaster on the wound, but there is a
tremendous amount of sovereign funding still to be done this
year. What is needed is something that can withstand headwinds.""
 
 PRECARIOUS PORTUGAL
 Although spreads have tightened considerably, outright debt
yields remain high. Portuguese 10-year paper yields 6.930
percent, a whisker below the 7 percent level seen as
unsustainable for a government to borrow at.
 As spreads represent the premium investors demand to hold
peripheral debt over benchmark German paper, moves this week
were accentuated by a poor run for Bunds ahead of the European
Central Bank rate meeting, with the 10-year bond yielding 3.265
percent in early trade on Thursday, up 40 bps since Jan. 7.
 Some analysts believe that while EFSF reforms would create a
buffer to protect Spain and Italy against speculative attacks,
the talk is only delaying the inevitable for Portugal, which has
weak economic fundamentals and nominal growth around 4 percent.
 ""If reforms had not been discussed, Portugal would have
already been bailed out,"" said RBS rate strategist Harvinder
Sian, who also warned thatthe legality of some measures could be
challenged in member states' constitutional courts.
 Traders said market activity in the periphery had been thin
and much of the tightening could be attributed to hedge funds
pulling back after they shorted peripherals on the mistaken
assumption the debt crisis would intensify in early 2011.
 ""There were some fairly big underweight positions in
peripheral trade, and these are very exaggerated moves based on
the volumes going through,"" a trader said. 
 ""The trigger behind the latest crunch tighter is
unsubstantiated press talk. I'm still cautious.""

 * Talks focus on enlarged EFSF fund, economic coordination
 * No firm decisions seen; aim is for late-March deal

(Adds Merkel, Sarkozy press conference, Rehn comments)
 By John O'Donnell and Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Germany and France proposed a
competitiveness pact for Europe on Friday and EU leaders
discussed strengthening a euro zone rescue fund, hoping to win
back market confidence in the bloc's public finances.
 Paris and Berlin -- the driving forces behind euro zone
policy -- set out a wish-list of measures they want euro zone
and other countries to sign up to including:
 * limits on debt levels written into national laws
 * a higher retirement age, based on demography
 * the abolition of wages indexed to inflation, and
 * a minimum corporate tax rate
 ""Germany and France will make it very obvious that we intend
to defend the euro as a currency ... we also want to defend it
as a political project,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a
joint news conference with French President Nicolas Sarkozy just
before a presentation to EU leaders.
 ""We want to send out a clear message, that as the European
Union, we intend to grow together. What we want to establish is
a pact for competitiveness,"" she said.
 The two biggest euro zone economies want the pact to be part
of a ""comprehensive package"" that leaders agree in March, when
they hope to agree a series of measures to help draw a line
under the euro zone's year-long sovereign debt crisis. 
 ""We are working hand in glove, France and Germany, with a
clear, total determination to support the euro,"" Sarkozy said.
 The package is to include changes to the European Financial
Stability Facility, the 440 billion euro bailout fund agreed
last May, to increase its effective lending capacity and give it
more flexibility on how to use its money.
 In draft conclusions prepared ahead of the summit, the 27
heads of state and government said they would consider ""concrete
proposals"" for strengthening the EFSF ""to ensure the necessary
flexibility and financial capacity to provide adequate support"",
with those discussions being finalized next month.
 EU diplomats said no major decisions would be taken on
Friday as market pressure on debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal
or Spain has eased. But officials understand that failure to
agree on concrete measures before the next scheduled summit on
March 24-25 could reignite the conflagration in the markets.
 In a sign of returning investor confidence, Spain's
borrowing costs fell sharply at bond auctions on Thursday.
Portugal has also had encouraging recent debt sales.
 Strengthening the EFSF has been the focus of discussion for
months, since it became clear its effective lending capacity was
only about 250 billion euros, not 440 billion, due to guarantees
built into the fund to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 Given its lending limitations, there are concerns that if
Portugal and Spain were both to end up needing a bailout, the
EFSF would not have sufficient funds. 
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, who
held talks with EU leaders over lunch, is among those calling
for the EFSF to be enlarged and made more flexible, so that it
is not just a bailout lender of last resort.
 
 RESISTANCE
 The EFSF is the chief weapon in the EU's arsenal, but deep
disagreement remains over how it should be strengthened, with
Germany determined to secure stricter budgetary commitments from
other euro zone members and reforms boosting competitiveness in
exchange for agreeing amendments to the fund.
 Economics and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn
praised Germany for entering the crisis stronger than others in
the EU thanks to broad structural reforms since the 1990s.
 ""It is important for everyone that other countries now
manage to do what Germany and a few other member states have
already managed in past years,"" Rehn wrote in a column in the
German daily Handelsblatt.
 Most of the proposals by Berlin and Paris have already been
set out by the European Commission in January in its Annual
Growth Survey as part of the new, tighter budget coordination
process called the European Semester.
 ""The ideas presented by some member states fit very well
with this overall approach of reinforcing our governance,""
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
 But some of the competitiveness reforms proposed by
Brussels, Paris and Berlin met with immediate resistance.
 ""I don't think it's possible for the European Union to
regulate the pension age because there are large differences in
the individual countries,"" Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann
said. ""I don't think it's right to interfere in wage
negotiations, like some have demanded.""
 There remains the risk that Friday's summit will underline
just how far apart states remain, with Germany largely backed by
the likes of France, Finland and the Netherlands, while Greece,
Italy, Spain and others pull in different directions.
 Euro zone officials privately express concerns about how
slowly work is progressing and say they doubt whether a complete
package can be agreed by late March. Leaders will consider
holding an extra summit in early March to maintain momentum.

 * Dollar rallies on fall in U.S. jobless rate
 * $1.3570 euro support holds, but traders see more losses
(Updates prices, adds detail, comment, change byline,
dateline, previous LONDON)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro on Friday after data showed the U.S. jobless rate in
January fell to its lowest level in nearly two years,
encouraging optimism about the U.S. economic outlook.
 That helped the dollar add to gains booked a day ago when
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet cooled
expectations for a near-term hike in euro zone interest rates.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.3586 , nearly a
cent below its session high. Support around $1.3570 was holding
but traders said the euro rally that lasted most of January
seems to be losing steam and a close below that level would
lead to further losses.
 The euro initially rose after U.S. data showed employers
added a meager 36,000 jobs last month, well below expectations,
but reversed course as U.S. yields rose and traders latched
onto the jobless rate's slide from 9.4 to 9 percent. For more
see [ID:nLDE7131GR].
 ""The drop in the jobless rate is a surprise and the dollar
is rallying on this,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""Yields are moving up and
while job creation not where people want it to be, the feeling
is there is an underlying momentum there.""
 A close below $1.3570 would put $1.35 in sight, and Dolan
said that could push the euro down to around $1.33 in coming
weeks.
 The market will be watching an EU summit on Friday,
although traders expect policymakers to wait until March before
making a final decision on bolstering a 440-billion-euro
bailout fund for struggling member states. [ID:nLDE7120QB]
 RATE DIFFERENTIALS
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 81.76 yen  and 1
percent at 0.9550 Swiss francs .
 Recent U.S. data, including reports on factory and service
sector activity, have shown signs of improvement, though
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated this week that
the U.S. recovery remains fragile. [ID:nWAL3DE7Z2]
 The Fed's stance had led investors to favor the euro in
recent weeks on the view the ECB would lift rates first but ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet dashed that view Thursday when he
said euro zone inflation was well anchored. [ID:nLDE7120I5]
 Trichet's comments prompted euro zone interest rate futures
 to pare expectations of a rate increase by August
and sparked a euro retreat from a three-month high at $1.3862.
 U.S. yields, meanwhile, have climbed in recent days. The
gap between two- and 10-year yields widened to 286 basis points
Friday, making for the steepest curve in more than 11 months.
[ID:nNYD003757]
 ""The U.S. economy is on a sugar high, helped by all the
stimulus, and we expect U.S. yields to continue creeping
higher,"" said Ankita Dudani, G-10 currency strategist at RBS
Global Banking. ""We expect euro/dollar to ease to $1.25 by the
end of the first half of the year.""
 But Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets in
Chicago, said the paltry job creation last month was not an
encouraging sign.
 ""I am surprised to see the euro tanking,"" he said. ""These
numbers are not supportive of the dollar. They mean the Fed is
going to stay around. Look for some profit-taking.""

762,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2011 09:40AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Investors looking beyond Egypt," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Financial market wobbles caused by
turmoil in the Middle East have done little to stop investors
positioning themselves for a further rally in stocks and other
riskier assets as economic growth accelerates around the world.
 In fact, rising oil and food prices -- the former
exacerbated by the unrest in Egypt and Tunisia -- are reminding
investors of growing inflation risks, which also reinforce the
case to buy equities, commodities and other risky assets rather
than bonds and money market instruments.
 World stocks measured by MSCI erased early losses last week
to hit 29-month highs. The benchmark index has risen 3.4 percent
since the start of the year and is on track to post its biggest
weekly gain in two months.
 Risk aversion also proved temporary. The VIX index -- Wall
Street's fear gauge -- fell below 17 percent on Thursday having
briefly jumped above 20 late last week.
 ""Rising energy and food prices have pushed up global
inflation in recent months. Since global economic growth
has simultaneously picked up, there is a growing risk that this
price increase is not just a temporary phenomenon,"" said Philipp
Baertschi, chairman of the investment committee at Sarasin.
 ""The economic environment for risky assets should remain
positive in the months ahead. We are therefore sticking to our
slight overweighting of equities. We aim to use any corrections
to build up risky assets further.""
 He said a 5-10 percent correction in stocks was now overdue
given the virtual non-stop rally since September 2010, adding
that Sarasin favours energy and technology sectors.
 Global surveys showed services sector activity surged in the
United States and Europe in January, mirroring similar reports
about global manufacturing and reinforcing expectations global
growth would be at a healthy 4 percent in 2011.
 And cash-rich corporates are on a shopping spree, which
shows that they are confident about an economic recovery.
 Thomson Reuters data shows the value of worldwide mergers
and acquisition totalled $309.6 billion so far this year, up 69
percent from 2010 and marking the strongest start for M&A since
2000. Financials, materials, energy and power sectors accounted
for almost two thirds of this year's total.
 Firms on the S&P 500 index -- 58 percent of which have
reported fourth-quarter results -- expanded their quarterly
earnings by nearly 37 percent.
 Lipper data shows emerging market equities suffered record
net redemptions of $4.1 billion in the week ending Feb 2,
although this comes after they attracted hefty inflows in 2010.
 Investor risk morale was intact, with U.S. stocks attracting
a net $4.11 billion. Investors have also pulled $57.5 billion
from money market funds in the past three weeks.
 Volatility is expected when Egypt's stock markets reopen in
the coming week after the index fell more than 21 percent since
the start of the year. But long-term investors still see value
in the biggest North African economy.
 
 INFLATION
 A growing threat to an otherwise favourable economic outlook
is inflation -- which is in part a source of turmoil in the
Middle East.
 Brent oil rose as high as $103.37 on Thursday, its highest
since September 2008. Global food prices tracked by the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organisation hit their highest level on
record in January, a problem set to worsen after a massive
snowstorms in the United States and floods in Australia. 
 JP Morgan expects a sustained 10 percent rise in oil prices
would cut global gross domestic product by 0.25 percentage
points.
 Mounting price pressures are grabbing attention of
policymakers, not just in emerging economies but in the
developed world.
 In the euro zone, whose inflation is already at a 15-month
high of 2.4 percent in January, European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet warned inflation is likely to climb further.
 UK inflation stands at an 8-month peak of 3.7 percent in
December and Britons' inflation expectations for the year ahead
picked up in January to a two-year high, raising expectations
that the Bank of England would raise interest rates this year.
 Goldman Sachs estimates that at the peak, estimated to be
around the third or fourth quarter, food and energy will add to
headline inflation to about 160 basis points in the United
States, 200 bps in the euro zone and UK and 90 bps in Japan.
 While G4 central banks (Fed, ECB, BoE and Bank of Japan)
focus on core inflation, higher commodity prices could push
inflation expectations higher and increase chances of
second-round effects.
 However, as long as inflation is under control, the
environment remains favourable for risky assets.
 Goldman noted that higher commodity prices are driven by a
strong bid from emerging economies, where central banks are
reluctant to raise interest rates to avoid currency
appreciation.
 ""The irony here is that by focusing on core inflation, the
major central banks are 'exporting' looser monetary policy to
emerging markets, and as a result, they are being forced to
'import' back higher food and energy prices,"" Goldman said.

 * Egyptians consume specially-blended Kenyan tea
 * Kenya may lose as much as 30 percent in coming auctions
 
 By Beatrice Gachenge
 NAIROBI, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Kenyan tea prices are expected to
fall steadily in coming auctions should the unrest in leading
buyer Egypt persist, traders said on Friday.
 Regulator Tea Board of Kenya said last week output leapt 27
percent to a record 399 million kgs and export earnings by 40
percent to 97 billion shillings ($1.2 billion), surging past
horticulture which brought in 78 billion. [ID:nLDE70N081
 Egypt bought over 93 million kgs in 2010, or 21 percent of
all the tea sold by the world's leading exporter of black tea.
 Brokers buying for Egyptian clients stayed away from this
week's auction and are expected to sit out next week's sale
should the protests in Egypt drag on.
 ""They (Egyptians) did not buy this week ... and last week
they bought about five percent out of the total 25 percent they
ordinarily buy,"" said a trader who asked not to be named.
 The weekly auction saw 43 percent of offered teas left
unsold, according to Mombasa-based Africa Tea Brokers.
 Thousands of Egyptian protesters have gathered for days in
central Cairo to demand the immediate resignation of President
Hosni Mubarak. Scores have been injured and several people
killed during the protests.
 Good Medium PDS fetched $3.18-$3.22 per kg from $3.40-$3.52
per kg last week, one of the tea varieties bought by Egyptian
buyers as well as Dust grades.
 Buyers for Egypt say their pockets are being hit hard.
 ""Most of the tea was purchased in December when the prices
were high, now they are low. What will happen is a lot of
defaults. So they (Egyptian buyers) may buy low to average the
prices,"" Peter Kimanga, a tea manager at Global Tea and
Commodities Kenya Ltd, told Reuters.
 Egyptians consume specially-blended Kenyan tea, mostly made
up of Dusts, which traders said narrows possible sales to other
markets due to different buyer specifications.
 
 NEW BUYERS
 The prevailing low prices for Dusts had attracted new tea
buyers from countries such as Kazakhstan, but their demand was
still not making up for the low volumes bought by Egypt.
 ""The Dust grade is suitable for tea bags so traders are
likely to move away from the good grades which are more
expensive,"" Kimanga said.
 Kenya may lose as much as 30 percent in auctions over the
next month should the Egyptian situation remain unresolved, he
said.
 A leading producer said warehouse space capacity was a
challenge since a bulk of the stock was Egyptian tea.
 ""It (Dust) is not moving. We are holding about 50-60 percent
of our total capacity of 24,000 packages ... it has an impact on
our finances,"" an official of the producing firm, who did not
want to be named, said.
 Fears of drought in east Africa's biggest economy has seen
some buyers stock up on tea, which they said may counteract the
downward pressure on prices caused by Egypt.

(Adds analyst on Swaziland, paragraphs 8-9)
 By Servaas van den Bosch
 WINDHOEK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Proposed changes to revenue
sharing within the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are
unacceptable because they place an unfair burden on its poorer
members, a senior Namibian official said on Friday.
 Deputy Finance Minister Calle Schlettwein said the changes,
which would mean much lower revenues for Swaziland, Namibia and
Botswana and a slight increase for South Africa, would polarise
the region and have ""very serious"" political implications.
 ""No one should be worse off under a new revenue sharing
formula, but this proposal doesn't give that,"" he told Reuters.
 ""South Africa gains, while the (smaller countries) are
losing. The gain is not evenly spread.""
 SACU, the world's oldest customs union which celebrated its
100th birthday last year, is in the throes of reforming a
revenue-sharing formula that now sees South Africa transferring
a large portion of its customs receipts to its neighbours.
 The transfers, which are meant to compensate the smaller
countries for South Africa's desire for high import duties on
things like cars, have historically accounted for nearly
two-thirds of government revenue in Swaziland and Lesotho, just
over a third in Namibia and 25 percent in diamond-rich Botswana.
 Under proposed revisions outlined in a document obtained by
Reuters this week, Swaziland's share of SACU receipts would fall
to 3 percent in 2019 from 9 percent in 2012, dealing a crippling
blow to its budget and economy.
 A sharp drop in SACU revenues due to a 2009 recession in
South Africa has already put the landlocked absolute monarchy in
dire financial straits, with the central bank having to dip into
reserves last year to pay civil servants.
 ""If Swaziland was a company, you would say it was bankrupt,""
said Christie Viljoen of NKC Independent Economists, a Cape
Town-based consultancy. Last year, Swazi reserves fell a third
to $640 million, or three months import cover, Viljoen said.
 
 BOTSWANA, NAMIBIA SQUEEZED
 Lesotho, a mountainous kingdom surrounded by South Africa,
would see its share rise to 9 percent from 8.5 percent, but
Botswana's would fall to 6.7 percent from 17 percent and
Namibia's to 9 percent from 15 percent.
 The redistribution formula was devised as a way of
compensating the smaller states for South African tariff policy
and its virtual monopoly on attracting external investment
because of its sheer size.
 However, the white-minority apartheid government that led
South Africa until 1994 also painted it as an altruistic subsidy
to deflect global criticism of its attitude towards blacks.
 Now South Africa has a democratically elected government,
that argument no longer applies, and a recession in 2009 piled
pressure on Pretoria to halt what many South Africans see as a
bank-rolling of its neighbours.
 Despite the desire for increased revenues, revision of the
SACU formula presents South Africa with a conundrum, since it
will have to pick up the pieces if Swaziland, which already has
one of the world's highest HIV/AIDS rates, collapses.
 Schlettwein said Namibia, which relies heavily on mining,
was looking to cut its reliance on SACU funds, which are
estimated at 6.6 billion Namibian dollars ($920 million) out of
a budget of 25 billion Namibian dollars.
 ""We already brought the SACU share of the budget down from
35 percent to 25 percent. We will continue this by deepening and
broadening the tax base,"" he said.
 ""This doesn't mean Namibia will accept the proposed cuts. We
have our position and we will fend for it.""

 (Adds detail, updates prices)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Friday,
having slid after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet cooled expectations for a near-term hike in interest
rates, while the dollar consolidated ahead of key U.S. jobs
data.
 Traders said whether the dollar's reprieve from a recent
sell-off and the euro's retreat from a 12-week high will
continue hinges on U.S. job data for January due at 1330 GMT.
 Economists polled by Reuters see the U.S. economy adding
145,000 jobs in January, increasing for the fourth straight
month, although the jobless rate is also likely to rise.
 ""Our U.S. economics team expects a more positive outcome,
forecasting 160,000 jobs. Given such a number, we look for a
continuation in yesterday's dollar relief rally, with the euro
eyeing support at $1.3550,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency
strategist at Credit Agricole.
 The euro traded flat at $1.3627, after falling 1.2 percent
the previous day and moving away from a 12-week peak of $1.3862
set on Wednesday. On the charts, the euro was holding around
support from an Ichimoku cloud top at $1.3623.
 More support lies at $1.3570, this week's low, and $1.3535,
which was resistance for the currency last month before a break
there turned it into support. A breach of those rates would open
the door for a slide below $1.35.
 Trichet, speaking after the ECB's decision to keep rates at
a record low 1 percent on Thursday, said inflation expectations
remained firmly anchored and inflationary pressures over the
medium to long term should remain contained.
 Trichet's comments prompted euro zone interest rate futures
to pare expectations of a rate increase by August to around 90
percent after having fully priced one in beforehand.
 The market will be watching an EU summit later on Friday,
although few traders expect anything startling to emerge as
measures to reinforce a bailout scheme for struggling member
states are not expected to be taken until March.
 
 READJUSTMENTS AHEAD OF U.S. JOBS
 The dollar is drawing support from a recent rise in U.S.
bond yields -- and expectations of a strong jobs number added to
that trend. The two-year Treasury note yield, sensitive to
changes in monetary policy expectations, has risen about 17
basis points this week.
 ""The U.S. economy is on a sugar high, helped by all the
stimulus, and we expect U.S. yields to continue creeping
higher,"" said Ankita Dudani, G-10 currency strategist at RBS
Global Banking. ""We expect euro/dollar to ease to $1.25 by the
end of the first half of the year.""
 But the euro and other currencies seen as higher risk could
also benefit from the rise in risk appetite that hopes of
stronger U.S. growth bring, especially if the data fails to
change the perception that the Federal Reserve is in no real
hurry to raise rates.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that despite
improved data the U.S. economy needs help from the central bank.
 The dollar index was flat at 77.774, having rebounded
sharply on Thursday and was off a 12-week low of 76.881 hit
earlier this week.
 The dollar was up slightly at 81.64 yen, drawing little help
from the rise in U.S. yields. Traders cite large stops under
81.00 yen.
 The Aussie dollar was up 0.3 percent at $1.0180, having
jumped to a one-month high of $1.0196 after the Reserve Bank of
Australia stayed upbeat on the economic outlook and played down
the impact of recent floods. Traders said an option barrier at
$1.0200 was helping to cap further Aussie gains.
 The Canadian dollar rose to a session high against the U.S.
dollar of C$0.9845 after Canada added 69,200 more jobs in
January, far more than most forecasts, while the unemployment
rate unexpectedly ticked up from 7.6 percent to 7.8 percent.

772,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2011 07:16AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Hot money flees Turkey's lira but no wider rout," * Lira eases some 6 percent to dollar, further easing eyed
 * $8 bln short-term money left Turkey - finance minister
 * $2 billion of foreign capital entered bonds since mid-Dec
 * Long-term Turkey a strong play, but inflation key focus
 
 By Alexandra Hudson and Behiye Selin Taner
 ISTANBUL, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Seven weeks since starting its
offensive against inflows of hot money, Turkey's central bank
looks to be winning the battle.
 Interest rate cuts have sent foreign buyers into retreat,
weakening the lira by some 6 percent since the bank launched its
bold new policies. Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek stated calmly
this week that $8 billion worth of short-term money has left.
 Data on foreign flows explains the relative sense of calm.
The central bank has managed to engineer, as intended, the
weakening of what it viewed as an over-valued currency without
sparking a large-scale flight of foreign capital from bonds and
shares as it aims to nudge investors into longer maturity
investments.
 Doubts over progress made by the bank on other fronts
however -- its fight against rampant credit growth and a surging
current account deficit -- could curb growth potential for
Turkish assets in the short term.
 The chief fear is that the central bank is inviting higher
inflation with its unorthodox mix of interest rate cuts with
increases to banks' required reserve ratios, and that it will be
forced into a sudden reversal later this year.
 Few foreign investors are seen significantly selling out of
a country which boasts a young, growing and increasingly wealthy
population and where economic growth is forecast at 4-5 percent
this year, after probably topping 7 percent in 2010.
 But it will take at least until the end of the first half
for markets to gauge if the bank's policy gamble has paid off.
 ""Turkey remains one of our biggest overweights,"" said George
Hoguet, senior portfolio manager at State Street.
 ""Its economic prospects are bright though we have to bear in
mind if we get a large shock to the world economy ... Turkey
would be impacted significantly from an economic standpoint as
well as capital flows.""
 Data on foreign holdings of short-term lira deposits is not
available, but data on treasuries and equities suggests Turkey
can still attract the longer-term money it wants.
 From mid December until Jan. 28 there has been an inflow of
$2.088 billion worth of foreign capital into Turkish treasuries,
although $1.1 billion worth of outside capital has left the
equity market, whose free float is two-thirds foreign owned.
 ""We see a sharp positioning shake-out as a low-risk event
considering Turkey's strong fundamentals, attractive growth
prospects, stabilising domestic political tensions and Turkish
yields still among the highest in the investable world,""
economists at RBC wrote in a note.
 But they added that with 18 percent of the government's
marketable debt stock in foreign hands, it would be damaging if
current account deficit fears or inflation fears start to drive
selling -- ratcheting up the stakes in the bank's fight.

 LOWER LIRA
 As recently as 2008 the lira had some of the highest
overnight borrowing rates in the world at 16.75 percent,
spurring carry trade. Although the bank had cut rates to 6.5
percent by early 2009, quantitative easing in western economies
spurred renewed carry trade -- inflating the lira.
 The central bank struck back by making the repo rate its
main policy rate, and in November slashing the overnight
borrowing rate to 1.75 percent from 5.75 percent -- all but
strangling foreign flows into overnight deposit accounts.
 It cut further to 1.5 percent last December.
 Some analysts now see the lira sliding to as far as 1.62 to
the dollar in the first quarter from current levels of 1.59,
with the blessing of the central bank.
 A weaker lira makes imports more expensive and will cool
rampant domestic demand, helping reduce the current account
deficit, which surged to an estimated 6.2 percent of gross
domestic product last year, from 2.3 percent in 2009.
 But a weaker lira also risks higher inflation, particularly
at a time of rising food and fuel prices.
 The central bank says it has balanced inflationary effects
by raising lenders' required reserve ratios, reducing the
amounts they dish it out in cheap loans.
 ""Net-net the central bank's action is a tightening, although
the required reserve ratio increases apply only to the domestic
economy. For forex trading the moves definitely have an easing
effect, which is why foreigners are flowing out of the lira,""
said Namik Aksel, fund manager at HSBC Asset Management.
 ""I think the moves are negative for the lira, flat to
negative for treasuries -- particularly shorter-term maturities,
but at the longer end it is a very different story. I also think
Turkish equities will see buyers after recent underperformance.""
 Turkish shares fell 1 percent since the start of 2011, after
rallying 27 percent last year.
 ""Valuations are attractive relative to other emerging
markets. The hope is that earnings growth compensates for any
foreign exchange losses,"" Hoguet said.
 The average price to earnings ratio for the index for 2011
is 10, compared with an average of 12 for Czech stocks, 13 for
Polish stocks, 9 for Russian stocks, and 18 for South African
stocks.

deadlock in the long-running Doha round trade talks by allowing
countries to make simultaneous trade-offs across the main areas.
 The proposal would meet demands from rich countries for a
more far-reaching deal, but require them in return to make
bigger concessions than emerging economies.
 Here are the main points of the proposal, a copy of which
was obtained by Reuters:
 
 INDUSTRIAL GOODS 
 The Mexican proposal tackles one of the issues that sank the
last push for a deal in 2008 -- the call by rich countries to go
beyond any general reduction in tariffs and have groups of
countries agree to cut further or eliminate entirely duties in
some industrial sectors, such as chemicals or electronics.
 Mexico says only the more advanced, or emerging, developing
countries would take part in a maximum of two sectors and would
be able to propose exceptions to cuts within those sectors for
specific products. Rich countries would have to participate in
every sector deal they sponsor, and with bigger cuts.
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS
 The Doha talks aim to free up trade in environmental
products from biofuels to windmills to help counter climate
change. Developed countries would have to make bigger cuts on a
wider range of goods than developing countries.
 
 SERVICES
 The biggest chunk of the economy, but one widely seen to be
lagging in the negotiations behind agriculture and
manufacturing.
 All the main trading countries would commit to keep markets
for services such as banking or law open at their current state,
on the basis of their current regulatory regime.
 Countries would be allowed to make exceptions, with more
exceptions permitted for developing countries.
 AGRICULTURE
 The key to an overall deal because of its importance for
developing countries.
 Here the proposal would prevent developed countries from
being able to increase their current actual tariffs on farm
produce as well as negotiating a cut in the ceiling.
 That is because negotiations set maximum permitted tariffs
for a product and allow countries to raise or lower duties at
will as long as they do not breach those ceilings.
 Under the Doha proposals countries will negotiate cuts in
those ceilings, according to a formula.
 Mexico says that where the formula cut leaves the new
ceiling for a developed country above its current actual tariff,
it must lower the ceiling further to the current rate.
 Developed countries would also not be able to seek any
further exceptions to these tariff cuts for sensitive products,
and would make further cuts in domestic subsidies.

 * Addresses rich country demands, but asks them to do more
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - As trading powers embark on a
renewed push for a Doha round trade deal, Mexico has come up
with a wide-ranging proposal to break the deadlock in the
long-stalled talks.
 Trade ministers agreed last week to push for an outline deal
in the decade-old talks by July, and instruct their negotiators
at World Trade Organization headquarters in Geneva to make the
necessary compromises to reach an agreement.
 Mexico's proposal attempts to tackle the fundamental divide
in the talks -- the call by rich countries for a more
far-reaching deal than is now on the table versus the demand by
poorer countries that a deal primarily promotes development.
 The United States and European Union want emerging economies
to open up their markets more than so far proposed, while
developing countries want advanced economies to make a bigger
contribution to the deal than they do.
 Since it is already agreed in principle that the world's
poorest countries would not have to make concessions, the
difference is between rich and fast-emerging economies like
Brazil, China, India, South Africa and Thailand.
 Some economists say a Doha deal could inject hundreds of
billions of dollars into the world economy. It would also boost
business sentiment and bolster defences against protectionism.
 While the nine-year-long negotiations have prompted yawns
and scepticism in the past, businesses are paying increasing
attention. The law firm King & Spalding issued a note to clients
on Thursday urging them to review how a deal could affect them.

 TRADE-OFFS
 Mexico's proposal, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters,
would require rich countries to do more to open their markets
than developing countries.
 It looks to open up a whole range of markets, from farming
and industrial goods to services, allowing negotiators to make
trade-offs across the board.
 For instance one country may be willing to make deeper cuts
in industrial tariffs if it sees its partner going the extra
mile on farm import duties.
 ""In the market access areas progress has been quite
limited,"" Mexican Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari told trade
ministers in the Swiss resort of Davos on Jan. 29, according to
a participant in the meeting.
 ""So the question is if we are going to be able to create a
shortcut towards a simultaneous solution for all market access
issues,"" he was quoted as saying.
 A Doha agreement may be quite different to Mexico's proposal
in the end, but it is certain to involve this kind of trade-off
across different sectors, known in the jargon as horizontal
negotiations.
 And once questions of market access are dealt with, other
problems such as cutting subsidies or improving rules for
unfairly priced imports will fall into place, Ferrari said.

 * Rules out own-initiative investigation against China
 * Commission cites ""massive"" Chinese financing for Huawei
 * Commission says ZTE received $25 bln state credit in 2009
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The European Union will drop its
inquiry into whether China is giving illegal aid to two of its
leading telecom firms, even as the EU's executive cites evidence
of massive subsidies, according to EU Commission documents.
 The Commission will propose ending two investigations into
illegal export pricing by and state aid to Chinese wireless
modem producers after the withdrawal of the complaint by
Europe's main producer, Belgium's Option, late last year,
according to a confidential document seen by Reuters.
 The proposal is expected to be approved by European Union
governments later this month, ending a case industry players had
expected to be a litmus test of the EU's willingness to
challenge Chinese state subsidies.
 ""It would be disproportionate to continue with the
investigation and impose measures following the withdrawal of
the complaint,"" the Commission said in its document, which was
distributed on Tuesday to interested parties in the case.
 But in a separate document also dated Tuesday and
distributed to EU governments, the commission cites evidence --
gathered since last summer -- that China's main telecom
producers Huawei and ZTE are state-controlled and receive cheap
state loans that give them an unfair advantage over their
European rivals.
 There was no comment from the EU Commission.
 Huawei and ZTE have denied receiving state aid, and neither
company could immediately be reached for a response.
 Option dropped its complaints of Chinese subsidies and
export dumping after it reached a cooperation agreement with
Huawei in October.
 
 AID ALLEGATIONS
 According to the Commission, ZTE received credit lines of
$15 billion from the China Development Bank and $10 billion from
the China Export-Import Bank in 2009.
 ""Such facilities are a major selling point which enables ZTE
to clinch deals in its export markets ahead of its competitors
such as Option in Belgium, while shifting the entirety or
majority of its risk of payment onto the Chinese policy banks,""
the document says.
 ""Huawei also benefited from similar massive financing
facilities"", including a $30 billion credit line from the China
Development Bank, the document says, adding: ""This suggests
significant state interference.""
 The Commission's findings also include allegations that ZTE
and Huawei are still influenced by the state.
 Beyond wireless modem manufacturing, the growth of Huawei
and ZTE in other sectors has worried European telecoms hardware
and network infrastructure producers such as Ericsson, Nokia
Siemens Networks and Alcatel-Lucent.
 It has also worried policy makers who fear China is
encroaching on high-tech sectors hitherto dominated by Europe.
Europe's chief trade negotiator last year vowed to face down
illegal state subsidies outside the EU, accusing China of
subsidising ""nearly everything"".

 * Grain imports seen up to 3 million T in year to June
 * Local supply dwindles due to panic buying, hoarding
 
 (Adds details)
 By Ruma Paul
 DHAKA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's state grains buyer
plans to increase the volume of rice and wheat tenders to speed
up imports and build stocks in the face of record global food
prices and analysts' fears of social unrest.
 ""We are thinking to raise the volume of grains in tenders,""
an official at the Directorate General of Food, who declined to
be named, said on Friday.
 The government is under increasing pressure to contain
prices. Analysts say Bangladesh faces unrest if prices continue
to rise, given that nearly 40 percent of its population survive
on less than $1 a day.
 ""If possible, for wheat tenders we may ask for 100,000
tonnes instead of the earlier 50,000 tonnes. For parboiled rice
we can seek 50,000 tonnes from an earlier 30,000 tonnes to cut
time and build stocks as quickly as possible,"" the official told
Reuters.
 ""If it is not possible, we will issue tenders for wheat and
rice every week,"" he said.
 U.S. wheat futures rallied to near 2.5-year highs on Friday
as concerns mounted about yields from the U.S. winter wheat crop
and boosted by stronger oil prices.
 Soaring prices pushed Bangladesh's food inflation rate to
11.01 percent in December, the highest level in three years.
 ""Domestic markets are facing supply shortages despite bumper
food production in the country in the last crop season,"" said
Mustafa K. Mujeri, director general of the Bangladesh Institute
of Development Studies.
 ""This is because growers, millers, retailers are trying to
keep their stores full, hoping to make windfall profits when
prices go further up. Consumers are also storing grains in panic
fearing that prices may reach beyond their buying capacity,""
Mujeri added.
 
 IMPORT PLANS
 The government seeks to import 2.2-3.0 million tonnes of
rice and wheat in the year to June, up from around 550,000
tonnes in the previous year.
 Bangladesh, which suffered badly during the 2008 spike in
global food prices, wants to build reserves of basic commodities
such as wheat, rice, oils and sugar to avoid a similar
situation.
 The United Nations said on Thursday its food price index
rose for the seventh month in a row to 231 in January, topping a
peak of 224.1 in June 2008. It is the highest level the index
has reached since records began in 1990.
 Rice is the main staple for Bangladesh's more than 150
million people, and the government is set to sell more rice at
subsided rate to the poor. Thousands stand in long queues for
rice, and many go home empty-handed when supplies run out.
 Although it is the world's fourth-biggest rice producer,
Bangladesh has emerged as a major importer this year and is
desperately looking for dependable sources for rice.
 ""The government is making frantic efforts to import rice and
wheat to ensure food security,"" Ahmed Hossain Khan, director
general of the state grains buyer, told Reuters.
 ""The government is also negotiating with Vietnam, Thailand
and Cambodia for long-term deals to import rice as India, once
the traditional supplier to Bangladesh, maintained its ban on
wheat and rice (exports),"" Khan said.
 The government has reserves of around 850,000 tonnes of rice
and wheat, and 125,000 tonnes are at ports while another 125,000
tonnes are due to arrive soon, a food and disaster management
ministry official said.
 A Bangladeshi delegation is now in Bangkok for negotiation
to import up to 200,000 tonnes of Thai parboiled rice, while
talks are continuing with India to buy 300,000 tonnes of rice.
 ""So we have nothing to fear about reserves,"" the government
official said.

 * Germany, France seek broader consensus on fiscal rules
 * No firm decisions seen; aim is for late-March deal

(Adds Merkel, European Commission comments)
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
discuss strengthening the euro zone's 440 billion euro bailout
fund at a summit on Friday and try to agree how best to insulate
the region from the year-long debt crisis.
 Germany and France will set out proposals for tighter
economic and fiscal coordination, measures they hope will be
included in a ""comprehensive package"" that leaders will agree in
March, along with changes to the European Financial Stability
Facility, the bailout fund agreed last May.
 ""We will talk about how to prepare decisions that are still
necessary, in particular with regard to the permanent crisis
mechanism which is to be agreed by March,"" German Chancellor
Angela Merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting.
 In draft conclusions prepared ahead of the summit, the 27
heads of state and government said they would consider ""concrete
proposals"" for strengthening the EFSF ""to ensure the necessary
flexibility and financial capacity to provide adequate support"",
with those discussions being finalized next month.
 With no major decisions therefore expected at Friday's
meeting, diplomats are describing it as a stock-taking exercise
to assess progress since the last meeting in December, since
when concerns about the debt crisis spreading from Greece and
Ireland to Portugal, Spain or beyond appear to have diminished. 
 ""Markets are turning, doubts about the solidity of the euro
and the euro zone are dissipating,"" a source in the French
presidency said on Thursday, briefing reporters ahead of the
summit. ""This is the moment to take a great step forward.""
 After a year of trying to extinguish sovereign debt flames,
officials have been heartened by relative calm in financial
markets in recent weeks, but recognise that failure to agree on
concrete measures before the next scheduled summit on March
24-25 could reignite the conflagration.
 In a sign of returning investor confidence, Spain's
borrowing costs fell sharply at bond auctions on Thursday.
Portugal has also had encouraging recent debt sales.
 Strengthening the EFSF has been the focus of discussion for
months, since it became clear its effective lending capacity was
only about 250 billion euros, not 440 billion, due to guarantees
built into the fund to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 Given its lending limitations, there are concerns that if
Portugal and Spain were both to end up needing a bailout, the
EFSF would not have sufficient funds. 
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, who
will hold talks with EU leaders over lunch, is among those
calling for the EFSF to be enlarged and made more flexible, so
that it is not just a bailout lender of last resort.
 One proposal for increasing the capacity involves the six
euro zone member states with triple-A credit ratings increasing
their own guarantees, while the remaining 11 would have to make
cash deposits to bolster the fund.
 Another is to allow the fund to buy the bonds of distressed
euro zone states, either directly in the primary market or by
lending money to states to buy back bonds, euro zone officials
have said.
 There is also likely to be discussion on Friday on the
bailouts that have already been provided to Greece and Ireland,
and on whether the interest rate being charged on their loans
should be lowered, or the term of the loans lengthened.
 
 GERMAN RESISTANCE
 The EFSF is the chief weapon in the EU's arsenal, but deep
disagreement remains over how it should be strengthened, with
Germany determined to secure stricter budgetary commitments from
other euro zone member states in exchange for agreeing
amendments to the fund.
 A German government official, at briefing in Berlin on
Wednesday ahead of the summit, appeared to close the door on one
proposal, saying bond-buying wasn't an option.
 ""It is not in our interest that the EFSF can buy bonds,"" the
official said. ""This is not practical.""
 In their proposals for economic coordination, France and
Germany will lay out plans for stricter fiscal discipline,
including the idea of a ""debt brake"" that would establish a
constitutional limit on deficits, and calls for more regular
euro zone summits to better coordinate economic management.
 ""We want to increase our competitiveness and grow closer
together within the Eurogroup and also invite other countries to
take part,"" Merkel said.
 Germany's ideas also include raising the pensionable age
depending on a country's demographics, limiting wage increases,
and agreeing a common tax base for corporations.
 Most of the proposals by Berlin and Paris have already been
set out by the European Commission in January in its Annual
Growth Survey as part of the new, tighter budget coordination
process called the European Semester.
 ""I ... expect progress on the comprehensive economic plan we
have prepared for the euro area and for the EU as a whole,""
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on
entering the summit. ""The ideas presented by some member states
fit very well with this overall approach of reinforcing our
governance.""
 There remains the risk that Friday's summit will underline
just how far apart states remain, with Germany largely backed by
the likes of France, Finland and the Netherlands, while Greece,
Italy, Spain and others pull in different directions.
 Euro zone officials privately express concerns about how
slowly work is progressing and say they doubt whether a complete
package can be agreed by late March. Leaders will consider
holding an extra summit in early March to maintain momentum.
 Friday's summit was originally set up to discuss energy
issues. While these remain on the agenda, the debt crisis and
the situation in Egypt are likely to dominate the discussion.
The leaders are expected to issue a statement on Egypt.

 By David Milliken
 LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The number of companies in England
and Wales forced into liquidation fell to its lowest level in
two-and-a-half years in the last three months of 2010, official
figures showed on Friday.
 Some 3,955 firms were liquidated between October and
December on a seasonally adjusted basis, the lowest quarterly
total since Q2 2008 and an 11.3 percent decline on the same
period a year earlier.
 Businesses benefitted from having reduced their reliance on
borrowing, said Kevin Booth, head of UK business support at
Barclays' corporate banking division.
 ""With new referrals into our business support team
continuing to track downwards, we anticipate a continued fall in
UK business failures well into 2011,"" he said.
 However, insolvencies in 2012 were harder to predict as many
firms would be hurt by falls in public spending and weak
consumer demand in 2011, Booth added.
 Personal insolvencies reached an all-time record high of
135,089 in 2010, though they have been on a downward trend since
the second quarter of the year. Fourth-quarter insolvencies came
in at 30,729, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009
and 13.6 percent lower than a year earlier.
 ""Lower unemployment has also helped to limit individual
insolvencies, while banks and creditors have also been
encouraged to take a sympathetic approach to financial
problems,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 However, Archer warned that many people were still at risk
-- especially as unemployment and Bank of England interest rates
are likely to rise this year.

 * G20 action on monetary system reform unlikely -Hirano
 * Inaction on Japan's public debt would have dire results
(Adds quotes)
 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Japan's monetary authorities are
likely to intervene again in the currency market to weaken the
yen if global financial markets destabilise and prompt safe-haven
buying of it, a former senior Bank of Japan official said on
Friday.
 ""The yen could attract buying because of its relative
stability if financial market worries temporarily heighten. In
that case, Japan is likely to intervene,"" Eiji Hirano, who
attended Group of Seven meetings as assistant governor at the
BOJ, told Reuters in an interview.
 But in the long term ""the yen is likely to peak"", Hirano
added, predicting a steep fall in the currency as Japan's
economic power and political clout decline.
 He did not give a specific time frame but said it could be
several years.
 Hirano, who left the BOJ in 2006, also said the dollar's
position as a global reserve currency is strengthening due to
credit problems in Europe that have dented trust in the euro and
the slight chance of drastic currency reform by China in the near
term.
 ""There is unlikely to be specific action on reform of the
global monetary system at the G20,"" he said, despite the desire
of France, which holds the year-long Group of 20 presidency, to
explore changes to the dollar's role as a reserve currency.
 G20 finance leaders gather in Paris on Feb. 18-19 and are
expected to discuss swings in commodity prices and reform of
global economic governance.
 UNSUITABLE FORUM
 Hirano said the G20 may not be a suitable forum to debate
currency issues as achieving a consensus among its members is
likely to be difficult. It is thus expected to stick to its
indirect approach to issues such as setting guidelines for
correcting global imbalances.
 He said Japan has not done enough to seek agreement from
other countries for its currency intervention. It made its first
foray into the market for over six years last September, spending
2 trillion yen ($24.51 billion) as the yen shot up to 15-year
highs against the dollar.
 ""Japan's action is justifiable as it was meant to check
currency moves that were out of line with economic fundamentals,""
said Hirano, who has close ties with central bankers across the
globe.
 He said there is a greater risk of ""selling Japan"", or
simultaneous selling of the yen and Japanese stocks and bonds,
over the next two to three years if the government fails to take
action on public debt, now about twice the size of its $5
trillion yen economy, by far the worst among major economies.
 ""The government may call on the Bank of Japan to do more, but
this is not right. It seems to believe monetary policy can solve
everything ... but such a belief is a road to ruin.""
 Political deadlock could derail a renewed drive to fix
Japan's tattered finances but the BOJ has so far seen no need to
draw up contingency plans for a debt crisis like those on the
euro zone's periphery.
 Given the likelihood of the Japanese economy's gradual
recovery this year, the BOJ is likely to stand pat on monetary
policy for the time being, Hirano said.

Services, the financial arm of Toyota Motor Corp.

* Copper hovers hear record high, oil prices edge up
 * Euro struggles after Trichet comments
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - World share prices rose while
bonds fell on Friday as investors positioned for the possibility
of strong U.S. jobs data, which would bolster the view of a
recovering global economy and further boost riskier assets.
 Such speculation boosted demand for U.S. shares, which were
expected to open higher, while copper prices hovered near a
record peak of $10,000 hit the day before.
 Oil prices were poised for a second straight week of gains
on concerns over political unrest in Egypt, where chaos has
underscored volatility in the Middle East and North Africa,
which together produce more than a third of the world's oil.
 Euro zone bonds dipped, relinquishing slight gains made the
previous day after comments from European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet cooled some speculation of an interest rate
rise in the coming months.
Debt prices are expected to remain under selling pressure as
Trichet's comments, while more dovish than his recent fighting
words on rising inflation, have done little to change the view
that ECB rates will rise this year.
The euro struggled, having trimmed its new year gains which
had been driven by growing anticipation of an ECB rate rise.
 U.S. non-farm payrolls due at 1330 GMT are forecast to show
the economy created 145,000 new jobs last month, after a rise of
103,000 in December. A strong reading will add to the view the
U.S. economy is recovering, which may boost share prices.
 Currency analysts said this may add to the dollar's recovery
from its sell-off in the past month, after investors bought back
the U.S. currency on Thursday when the euro was sold.
""Our U.S. economics team expects a more positive outcome
forecasting 160,000 jobs. Given such a number, we look for a
continuation in yesterday's dollar relief-rally with the euro
eyeing support at $1.3550,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency
strategist at Credit Agricole.
 A run of upbeat economic data has added fuel to the view the
global economy is recovering, which has boosted demand for
higher-risk assets including stocks.
 But the dollar has struggled despite solid economic figures,
suffering on speculation the Federal Reserve will lag other
major central banks in raising rates, and some analysts said
higher-than-expected payrolls would not change that view.
 The euro was flat on the day at $1.3630, while the dollar
was unchanged at 77.790 against a currency basket.
 
 EGYPT IN FOCUS
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.3 percent in early
European trade. The index hovered near its highest intraday
level in more than two years hit last month.
The MSCI world equity index rose 0.3 percent, hovering near
a 2 1/2-year high hit earlier this week.
 Stocks extended gains after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke on Thursday said the economy still needs help from
the central bank, which was taken as a sign that monetary policy
will remain accommodative for now.

 German Bund futures slid to 122.95, 22 ticks lower on the
day while the price of other safe-haven assets such as U.S.
Treasuries and Japanese government bonds also fell as investors
priced in the possibility of buoyant payrolls.
 Spanish, Italian and other lower-rated euro zone debt
outperformed Bunds as expectations of an eventual, sustainable
rescue plan for indebted European countries prompted investors
to pick up peripheral bonds after they fell on Thursday.
 Even as investors expect the global economy to continue
recovering, many were keeping an eye on political unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East, which was supporting oil

(Adds details from draft conclusions) 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
discuss strengthening the euro zone's 440 billion euro bailout
fund at a summit on Friday and try to agree how best to insulate
the region from the year-long debt crisis.
 Germany and France will set out proposals for tighter
economic and fiscal coordination, measures they hope will be
included in a ""comprehensive package"" that leaders will agree in
March, along with changes to the European Financial Stability
Facility, the bailout fund agreed last May.
 In draft conclusions prepared ahead of the summit, the 27
heads of state and government said they would consider ""concrete
proposals"" for strengthening the EFSF ""to ensure the necessary
flexibility and financial capacity to provide adequate support"",
with those discussions being finalized next month.
 With no major decisions therefore expected at Friday's
meeting, diplomats are describing it as a stock-taking exercise
to assess progress since the last meeting in December, since
when concerns about the debt crisis spreading from Greece and
Ireland to Portugal, Spain or beyond appear to have diminished. 
 ""We are at a key moment -- markets are turning, doubts about
the solidity of the euro and the euro zone are dissipating,"" a
source in the French presidency said on Thursday, briefing
reporters ahead of the summit.
 ""This is the moment to take a great step forward.""
 After a year of trying to extinguish sovereign debt flames,
officials have been heartened by relative calm in financial
markets in recent weeks, but recognise that failure to agree on
concrete measures before the next scheduled summit on March
24-25 could reignite the conflagration.
 In a sign of the increased confidence markets are showing in
how the euro zone is confronting the crisis, Spain saw borrowing
costs fall sharply at an auction of two- and five-year bonds on
Thursday. Portugal has also had encouraging recent auctions.
 Strengthening the EFSF has been the focus of discussion for
months, since it became clear its effective lending capacity was
only about 250 billion euros, not 440 billion, due to guarantees
built into the fund to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 Given its lending limitations, there are concerns that if
Portugal and Spain were both to end up needing a bailout, the
EFSF would not have sufficient funds. 
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, who
will hold talks with EU leaders over lunch, is among those
calling for the EFSF to be enlarged and made more flexible, so
that it is not just a bailout lender of last resort.
 One proposal for increasing the capacity involves the six
euro zone member states with triple-A credit ratings increasing
their own guarantees, while the remaining 11 would have to make
cash deposits to bolster the fund.
 Another is to allow the fund to buy the bonds of distressed
euro zone states, either directly in the primary market or by
lending money to states to buy back bonds, euro zone officials
have said.
 There is also likely to be discussion on Friday on the
bailouts that have already been provided to Greece and Ireland,
and on whether the interest rate being charged on their loans
should be lowered, or the term of the loans lengthened.
 
 GERMAN RESISTANCE
 The EFSF is the chief weapon in the EU's debt-fighting
arsenal, but deep disagreement remains over how it should be
strengthened, with Germany determined to secure stricter
budgetary commitments from other euro zone member states in
exchange for agreeing amendments to the EFSF.
 A German government official, briefing in Berlin ahead of
the summit on Wednesday, appeared to close the door on one
proposal, saying bond-buying wasn't an option.
 ""It is not in our interest that the EFSF can buy bonds,"" the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""This is not
practical.""
 In their proposals for economic coordination, France and
Germany will lay out plans for stricter fiscal discipline,
including the idea of a ""debt brake"" that would establish a
constitutional limit on deficits, and calls for more regular
euro zone summits to better coordinate economic management.
 Germany's ideas also include raising the pensionable age
depending on a country's demographics, limiting wage increases,
and agreeing a common tax base for corporations.
 There remains the risk that Friday's summit will underline
just how far apart states remain, with Germany largely backed by
the likes of France, Finland and the Netherlands, while Greece,
Italy, Spain and others pull in different directions.
 Euro zone officials privately express concerns about how
slowly work is progressing and say they doubt whether a complete
package can be agreed by late March. Leaders will consider
holding an extra summit in early March to maintain momentum.
 Friday's summit was originally set up to discuss energy
issues. While they remain on the agenda, the debt crisis and the
situation in Egypt are likely to dominate the discussion. A
statement from the leaders on Egypt is expected.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Friday,
having slid after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet cooled expectations for a near-term hike in interest
rates, while the dollar inched up ahead of key jobs numbers.
 Traders said that whether the dollar's reprieve from a
recent sell-off and the euro's retreat from a 12-week high will
continue hinges on the U.S. job data for January due later in
the day.
 Economists polled by Reuters see the U.S. economy adding
jobs for the fourth straight month in January, up 145,000,
though the jobless rate is also likely to rise [ID:nN0366997].
 ""Our U.S. economics team expects a more positive outcome
forecasting 160,000 jobs. Given such a number, we look for a
continuation in yesterday's dollar relief-rally with the euro
eyeing support at $1.3550,"" said Adam Myers, senior currency
strategist at Credit Agricole.
 The euro traded flat at $1.3630 , after falling 1.2
percent the previous day and moving away from a 12-week peak of
$1.3862 set on Wednesday. On the charts, the euro was holding
around support from an Ichimoku cloud top at $1.3626.
 More support lies at $1.3570, this week's low, and $1.3535,
which was resistance for the currency last month before a break
there turned it into support. A breach of those rates would open
the door for a slide below $1.35.
 A strong jobs number bodes well for growth in the U.S.
economy and an eventual rise in interest rates there -- reducing
the prospect of a rise in the disparity between risk premiums
for holding euros and dollars.
 Trichet, speaking after the ECB's decision to keep rates at
a record low 1 percent on Thursday, said inflation expectations
remain ""firmly anchored"" and inflationary pressures over the
medium to long term ""should remain contained"". [ID:nLDE7120I5]
 His comments disappointed euro bulls who expected a more
hawkish statement after recent inflation data came in above
forecasts. 
 Trichet's comments prompted euro zone interest rate futures
 to pare expectations of a rate increase by August to
around 90 percent after having fully priced in one beforehand.
 The market will be watching an EU summit later on Friday,
although few traders expect anything startling to emerge as
measures to reinforce a bailout scheme for struggling member
states are not expected to be taken until March. [ID:nLDE7120QB]
 
 READJUSTMENTS AHEAD OF U.S. JOBS
 The dollar is drawing support from a recent rise in U.S.
bond yields -- and expectations of a strong jobs number added to
that trend.
 ""U.S. bond yields seem about to go above their recent
ranges. If they do, that will likely lead to a broad recovery in
the dollar,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 But the euro and other currencies seen as higher risk could
also benefit from the rise in risk appetite that hopes of
stronger U.S. growth bring, especially if the data fails to
change the perception that the Federal Reserve is in no real
hurry to raise rates.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that despite
improved data the U.S. economy needs help from the central bank.
[ID:nWAL3DE7Z2]
 U.S. short-term interest rates futures suggest traders have
raised their expectations that the Fed could increase rates at
the end of the year in a bid to keep a lid on inflation.
 Bolstering those expectations and the dollar's rebound were
reports showing the U.S. services sector grew in January at its
fastest pace since August 2005. [ID:nN0682144]
 The dollar index was marginally higher at 77.79, having
rebounded sharply on Thursday and off a 12-week low of 76.881
<.DXY> <=USD> hit earlier this week.
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 81.59 yen ,
drawing little help from the rise in U.S. yields -- a sea change
from last year when the pair closely tracked debt prices.
Traders cite large stops under 81.00 yen.
 The Aussie dollar  was up 0.3 percent at $1.0188,
having jumped to a one-month high of $1.0196 after the Reserve
Bank of Australia stayed resolutely upbeat on the economic
outlook and played down the impact of recent floods.

 * Shipments likely to below 2.5 mln tonnes in 2011/12
 * Cyclone damage follows worst harvest in 20 years

 By Bruce Hextall	
 SYDNEY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Raw sugar exports from Australia
in 2011/12 are expected to fall more than 20 percent below
average after a huge cyclone hit the sugarcane industry's
heartland this week, analysts said on Friday.	
 Australia is usually the world's third largest exporter of
raw sugar exporter, behind Brazil and Thailand, with average
overseas sales of 3.2 million tonnes in recent years.	
 But Cyclone Yasi, which smashed in the northeast coast on
Thursday, is likely to prevent exports from reaching anywhere
near the number for the second year in a row.	
 Last year, the industry recorded its worst harvest in 20
years after prolonged wet weather delayed the harvest, lowered
sugar content and left more than 5 million tonnes of cane uncut.	
 ""Exports will be constrained for yet another year below 2.5
million tonnes,"" said Paul Deanes, senior agricultural economist
at ANZ Banking Group.	
 
 
 World sugar prices surged four percent to 30-year
highs on Wednesday as Cyclone Yasi came ashore, but fell back
9.3 percent a day later as investors took profits.	
 ANZ's Deanes expects Australia to lose up to 10 percent of
total sugar output in 2011. Cane output could be similar to the
27.4 million tonnes harvested last year. Normally, Australia has
produced around 33 million tonnes a year on average.	
 Production losses could even exceed 10 percent because the
worst-affected area, north of the coastal city of Townsville, is
estimated to have had 50 percent of its crop damaged.	
 This area produces around 30 percent of the country's cane,
suggesting total losses in the region of around 15 percent or
possibly as high as 20 percent, according to Rabobank.	
 ""We were looking around a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction
in production in the area that was worst affected,"" said
Rabobank general manager Rural Australia Peter Knoblanche. 
 On the positive side the majority of the cane left
unharvested at the end of 2010 was in areas which appear to have
escaped major cyclone damage. This should help limit losses.	
 Sugarcane is like grass and once cut regrows with uncut cane
retaining the potential to yield sugar in following years. The
cane is usually harvested between June and October.	
 In Queensland, where more than 90 percent of the country's
sugarcane is located, cane is grown on a four year rotation.
That means an area planted this year with sugarcane will not be
replanted again for another four years.	
 ""Going forward, it will take time to assess the extent of
the damage, but I think it is one of these things that always
starts with a worst case scenario,"" said Neil Burgess, senior
commodities analyst at Westpac Banking Corp.	
 He said global sugar prices were likely to remain volatile
until the world demand/supply picture became clearer, adding
that global supplies were currently tight.	
 Burgess said the two big unknowns were the extent of Indian
exports and the size of the harvest in Brazil, the world's top
sugarcane producer. Damage to the Australian crop has added
another layer of uncertainty.	
 The Brazilian harvest starts next month but cane output
could decline for the first time in 11 years from the previous
crop after a long dry spell in 2010 hit cane growth.	
 India, the second largest producer, is also considering
exports after a recovery in its production.	
 ""There is volatility in the market, there is real price
support because of sugar supply tightness so all things being
equal you should see prices continue to be well supported,""
Burgess said.	
 If the production outlook improved, investment funds were
likely to take some of their money off the table, a factor which
would take prices off near 30-year highs, he added.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The euro was on the defensive on
Friday after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
poured cold water on expectations for a near-term rate hike,
wrongfooting bulls who had expected more tough talk on inflation.
 Whether the euro's retreat from a 12-week high will continue
now hinges on U.S. job data due later in the day, with a break of
support around $1.3535-70 seen as a potential sign of more losses
down the road.
 Trichet, speaking after the ECB's decision to keep rates at
a record low 1 percent on Thursday, said inflation expectations
remain ""firmly anchored"" and inflationary pressures over the
medium to long term ""should remain contained"".
 His comments disappointed investors who expected a more
hawkish statement after recent inflation data came in above
forecasts. Expectations the ECB would lift interest rates sooner
than the Federal Reserve had boosted the euro in recent weeks.
 The euro traded at $1.3625 after falling 1.2 percent the
previous day, moving further away from a 12-week peak of $1.3862
set on Wednesday.
 On charts, the euro is now clutching at support from an
Ichimoku cloud top at $1.3626.
 More supports lies at $1.3570, this week's low, and $1.3535,
which was resistance for the currency last month before a break
there turned it into support.
 A breach of those rates would open the door for a slide below
$1.35 -- a scenario some analysts view as likely.
 ""I think the market's expectations of ECB rate hikes had gone
a bit too far,"" said Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Corp.
 Trichet's comments prompted euro zone interest rate futures
to reflect a rolling back of expectations of a rate increase by
August to around 80 percent from fully pricing it in before.
 Sera said such expectations may retreat further and push the
euro to around $1.34.
 ""It's true the ECB is moving towards normalisation step by
step. But it's questionable if the ECB can raise rates just
focusing on the strength in Germany and ignoring high
unemployment in some other countries,"" Sera said
 The market will be watching an EU summit later on Friday,
although few traders expected a surprise as any measures to
reinforce its bailout scheme are expected to be taken in March.
 More important will be U.S. jobs data due at 1330 GMT, with
market players expecting it to show jobs growth of 145,000 in
January.
 Some traders think a stronger reading would favour the dollar
at the expense of the euro.
 ""U.S. bond yields seem about to go above their recent ranges.
If they do, that will likely lead to a broad recovery in the
dollar,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 But others think the market reaction may not be
straightforward as the euro could benefit from rising risk

for unemployment benefits dropped sharply.
 The dollar index showing its value against a basket of
currencies rebounded sharply on Thursday but moved little on
Friday at 77.74, off a 12-week low of 76.881 hit earlier this
week.
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 81.61 yen,
drawing little help from a rise in U.S. bond yields -- a sea
change from last year when the pair closely tracked U.S. debt
yields.
 Although the two-year U.S. bond yield climbed to a new
one-month high of 0.73 percent and looks set to rise to an
8-month peak if the U.S. job data turns out to be strong, the
dollar hovered not far from a one-month low of 81.31 yen hit
earlier this week.
 UNLIKELY TO STEP UP
 While bids by Japanese investors are supporting the dollar
for now, some analysts say Japanese investors are unlikely to
step up their dollar buying.
 ""Even if the two-year yield rises to 1 percent, Japanese
investors will not buy dollar bonds without currency hedging
because they can get far better returns on hedged U.S. bonds than
domestic bonds,"" said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""I expect the dollar to fall below 80 yen. It seems to be in
a broad downtrend,"" he said.

 By Vikram S.Subhedar	
 HONG KONG, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Japanese shares rose on Friday,
lifted by news of a mega merger in the steel sector, while a
rebounding dollar put a slight dent in a commodities rally that
saw copper hit a record $10,000 a tonne in the previous session.	
 While there are signs that the global economy is gaining
momentum, many market players were on the sidelines, eyeing
developments in Egypt after the White House was said to be
discussing the immediate resignation of Hosni Mubarak as one of
several scenarios for a transition of power. 
 The U.S. move comes after 10 days of anti-government
protests in Egypt and ahead of a mass ""Day of Departure"" rally
planned by protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday to
force Mubarak to quit.	
 Clashes between pro- and anti-Mubarak demonstrators have
fueled fears of possible disruptions to energy supplies and
boosted crude oil prices, which were headed for a second
straight week of gains.	
 Brent crude for March gained 31 cents on Friday to
$102.07 a barrel at 0525 GMT, after touching $103.37 on
Thursday, the highest intraday price since Sept. 26 2008, and
then sliding on a stronger dollar. U.S. crude rose 39
cents to $90.93.	
 Japan's Nikkei shares gained 1.1 percent, lifted by
steelmakers which surged on news of a mega merger in the sector
that would create the world's No.2 steel producer.	
 Tough competition from steelmakers in China and India,
shrinking demand from domestic automakers and rising prices for
raw materials such as coal and iron ore prompted the deal which
would likely see Nippon Steel acquiring Sumitomo Metal, valued
at $11 billion. 
 Shares of Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal
rallied sharply, rising 9 percent and 16 percent, respectively.	
 ""The news will likely raise expectations that more Japanese
companies will seriously try to increase their competitive edge
in the global market,"" said Shinichiro Matsushita, a senior

 ""On top of last week's NEC-Lenovo deal, these deals will
boost investor sentiment towards Japanese stocks.""	
 The Nikkei has risen 3.1 percent so far this year and is
Asia's top performing market as investors continue to favour
developed markets over emerging markets that are battling with
high inflation and political risk. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index
is up just 0.6 percent.	
 Australia's key stock index rose 0.9 percent as
heavyweighted commodity-related stocks rallied. Most other
markets in Asia remained shut for the Lunar New Year holidays
and will reopen on Monday.

 Spurred by further signs that the global economic recovery
is gaining traction and speculative buying, copper hit
$10,000 a tonne for the first time in London overnight, before
easing slightly. 
 Sugar retreated as well after spiking to 30-year tops
on Wednesday as a killer cyclone battered Australia's sugar cane
fields. Wheat rebounded after a brief decline, staying
near the 2008 highs seen in the last session after a snowstorm
that paralyzed the U.S. grain belt.	
 Surging food prices have come back into the spotlight after
they helped fuel the discontent that toppled Tunisia's president
in January and spilled over to Egypt and Jordan. 
 Global food prices tracked by a U.N. agency hit their
highest level on record in January. 
 Markets fear many central banks may have to take more
aggressive action to contain growing inflationary pressures,
which could dampen global growth.	
 Weighing on commodity prices on Friday was a rebound in the
U.S. dollar as stronger-than-expected growth in the U.S.
services sector showed a resilient economy. 
 Rising service-sector activity, improved jobless claims
figures and stronger-than-expected retail figures in the U.S.
have raised confidence ahead of Friday's payrolls report that is
expected to show the economy adding 145,000 jobs in January.	
 A strong jobs report could help the dollar extend gains
against the euro.	
 The euro was on the defensive after its more than 1
percent drop overnight after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet threw cold water on expectations of a rise
in euro zone interest rates. 
 The single currency was trading at $1.3633 by the afternoon
in Asia, moving further away from a 12-week high of $1.3862 set
on Wednesday.

 * Tighter budget rules, stronger rescue fund on agenda
 * No firm decisions expected; aim is for late-March deal
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - France and Germany will lay out
proposals for tighter economic coordination at a summit on
Friday, hoping to forge agreement among European leaders on how
best to resolve the euro zone's year-long debt crisis.
 No concrete decisions are expected at the one-day meeting,
with diplomats describing it as a stock-taking exercise to
assess progress since the 27 leaders last met in mid-December,
since when concerns about the crisis spreading from Greece and
Ireland to Portugal, Spain or beyond have diminished. 
 Diplomats say the summit's aim is to build consensus among
the 17 euro zone countries, and the wider European Union, on a
""comprehensive package"" to resolve the crisis, including closer
euro zone fiscal coordination and a reinforced rescue fund.
Germany and France want an agreement by the end of March.
 ""We are at a key moment -- markets are turning, doubts about
the solidity of the euro and the euro zone are dissipating,"" a
source in the French presidency said on Thursday, briefing
reporters ahead of the summit.
 ""This is the moment to take a great step forward.""
 After a year of trying to extinguish the sovereign debt
flames, officials have been heartened by relative calm in
financial markets in recent weeks, but recognise that failure to
agree on concrete measures before the next scheduled summit on
March 24-25 could reignite the conflagration.
 In a sign of the increased confidence markets are showing in
how the euro zone is confronting the crisis, Spain saw borrowing
costs fall sharply at an auction of two- and five-year bonds on
Thursday. Portugal has also had encouraging recent auctions.
 In their proposals, France and Germany are expected present
plans for stricter fiscal discipline, including the idea of a
""debt brake"" that would establish a constitutional limit on
deficits for euro zone members, and calls for more regular euro
zone summits to better coordinate economic management.
 Germany's ideas also include raising the pensionable age
depending on a country's demographics, limiting wage increases,
and agreeing a common tax base for corporations.
 
 BIG, BOLDER RESCUE FUND
 Friday's discussions will also cover the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro fund set up last
May and used in November to bail out Ireland, with policymakers
focused on finding ways to increase its effective size and make
it more flexible.
 Because of guarantees built into the EFSF to maintain its
triple-A credit rating, the fund can only lend about 250 billion
euros, not 440 billion, meaning if Portugal and Spain ultimately
needed bailouts, there might not be sufficient funds.
 One proposal for increasing the capacity involves the six
euro zone member states with triple-A credit ratings increasing
their own guarantees, while the reminder would have to make cash
deposits to bolster the fund.
 The EFSF is the chief weapon in the EU's debt-fighting
arsenal, but disagreement remains over how it should be
strengthened and Germany appears determined to secure stricter
budgetary commitments from other euro zone member states in
exchange for agreeing amendments to the EFSF.
 Among ideas on the table for improving the fund is to allow
it to buy the bonds of distressed euro zone states, either
directly in the primary market, or by lending money to states to
buy back bonds, euro zone officials have said.
 But a German government official, briefing in Berlin ahead
of the summit on Wednesday, appeared to close the door on such a
possibility, saying bond-buying wasn't a viable option.
 ""It is not in our interest that the EFSF can buy bonds,"" the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""This is not
practical.""
 There remains the risk that Friday's summit will underline
just how far apart states remain, with Germany largely backed by
the likes of France, Finland and the Netherlands, while Greece,
Italy, Spain and others pull in different directions.
 Euro zone officials privately express concerns about how
slowly work is progressing and say they doubt whether a complete
package can be agreed by late March. Laders will consider
holding an extra summit in early March to maintain momentum.
 Friday's summit was originally set up to discuss energy
issues. While they remain on the agenda, the debt crisis and the
situation in Egypt are likely to dominate the discussion. A
statement from the leaders on Egypt is expected.

(Updates prices, adds detail, Bernanke)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Thursday and could extend losses after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet threw cold water on expectations
euro zone interest rates would rise any time soon.
 Trichet, speaking after the ECB's decision to keep interest
rates at a record low 1 percent, said inflation expectations
remain ""firmly anchored"" and inflationary pressures over the
medium to long term ""should remain contained."" For details, see
[ID:nLDE7120I5]
 His comments disappointed investors who had expected a more
hawkish statement after recent inflation data came in above
forecast. Expectations the ECB would lift interest rates sooner
than the Federal Reserve boosted the euro in recent weeks.
 The euro fell more than 2 cents on the day, moving further
away from a 12-week high of $1.3862 set on Wednesday. It was
last down 1.3 percent at $1.3626 . Traders said support
now lies at $1.3570, this week's low, and a break would open
the door for a slide below $1.35.
 ""Trichet failed to deliver on expectations for a hawkish
statement,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency
strategist at Westpac in New York. ""He merely repeated what he
said in January, which is that inflation risks are balanced but
could move to the upside. The markets were clearly looking for
something more aggressive than that.""
 Interest rate futures  imply an 80 percent chance
of a 25 basis point rate increase by August. Before the
meeting, the market was fully pricing in a rate hike by then.
The spread between German and U.S. two-year bond yields
narrowed to 69 basis points from around 75 basis points.
 ""The market has rightly interpreted Trichet's comments as a
sign that the prospect of a near-term rate hike is still
premature,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, an analyst at Credit
Agricole in a note.
 ""That said, it is very likely, in our opinion, that the ECB
staff of economists will revise GDP and inflation projections
upwards next month based on recent data and oil price
dynamics.""
 The euro lost 1.2 percent to 111.24 yen . It also
traded sharply lower versus the Swiss franc  and
sterling .
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 81.64 yen , while an
index measuring the dollar against a basket of six currencies,
rose 0.9 percent to 77.844 <.DXY>, rebounding from a 12-week
low set on Wednesday.
 SOLID US DATA
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Thursday that
despite improved U.S. economic data, the economy needs help
from the central bank. [ID:nWAL3DE7Z2]
 Still, expectations the recovery is taking hold pushed U.S.
10-year Treasury yields  north of 3.54 percent,
above a range that has held solidly since mid-December. Higher
bond yields make dollar-denominated assets more attractive.
 U.S. short-term interest rates futures suggest traders have
raised their expectations that the Fed could raise rates at the
end of the year in a bid to keep a lid on inflation.
 Bolstering those expectations and the dollar's broad rally
were reports showing the U.S. services sector grew in January
at its fastest pace since August 2005 while new weekly claims
for unemployment benefits fell sharply. [ID:nN0682144]
 The data ""have rekindled optimism about the transition
of the U.S. economy from recovery to expansion,"" said Samarjit
Shankar, managing director of global foreign exchange strategy
at BNY Mellon in Boston.
 ""This, in addition to the renewed worsening of the
political and social unrest in Egypt, has underpinned the
renewed buying interest in the U.S. dollar,"" he added. ""Whether
this is sustained or is just a blip remains to be seen.""
 Analysts said a strong reading on U.S. employment on
Friday could help the dollar extend gains against the euro.

 BRUSSELS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The European Parliament proposed
stricter rules on Thursday to halt what has become Europe's
fastest growing type of waste: discarded mobile phones,
computers and other electronic devices.
 European Union lawmakers said they wanted member states to
collect at least 85 percent of discarded electronics by 2016,
compared with only 33 percent today.
 Under the proposed new rules, electronics producers will be
expected to foot the bill for collecting discarded appliances.
 Karl-Heinz Florenz, a German parliament member who drafted
the text adopted on Thursday, said the 85 percent target was
challenging but realistic.
 Florenz said there were more than 8 million tonnes of waste
electronics in the EU in 2005, about 20 kilograms per EU
citizen. This total is expected to grow to 12.3 million tonnes
by 2020.
 The EU is concerned that if not properly disposed of, the
electronics, much of which contains toxic metals and compounds,
could cause health problems and harm the environment.
Many used electronics are also illegally shipped overseas for
disposal, meaning sought after raw materials such as gold and
rare earth minerals leave the EU.
 The measures still require the approval of the European
Council, which is scheduled to debate the issue in March.

 MADRID, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Europe should work on harmonising

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled on Thursday as
odds for a near-term interest rate rise in Europe diminished,
while violence in Egypt kept investors on edge, driving oil
above $103 a barrel and pressuring equities.
 The latest U.S. economic data added to evidence that the
recovery is taking hold, helping drive copper to a record
$10,000 a tonne and providing support to equities in Europe.
 But on Wall Street, prices fell as fighting between
demonstrators and those loyal to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak diminished risk appetite as investors weighed whether
it is time to lock in profits after a 29-month global rally.
 Global food prices measured by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization hit their highest level since records
began in 1990. Rising food costs have been a key driver of the
turmoil in Egypt and Tunisia that is threatening to spill over
to other countries. For details, see [ID:nSGE71203E]
 The European Central Bank held interest rates unchanged at
1 percent, as expected, but remarks from ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet on inflation threw cold water on market
expectations that interest rates would rise anytime soon.
 Trichet said inflation is likely to climb further and could
exceed the bank's 2 percent target for most of the year, but
there is no threat to medium-term price stability.
[ID:nECBNEWS] [ID:nLDE7120I5]
 ""Trichet and the ECB Governing Council are inching towards
a rate hike later this year, but at a slower pace than the
market expected,"" said Michael Woolfolk, managing director at
BNY Mellon Global Markets.
 ""While the ECB may delay lifting rates, when it does so the
euro/U.S. dollar will once again be back above the $1.4000
level,"" he added.
 The euro dropped 1.22 percent to $1.3634  and 0.90
percent to 111.59 against the yen. The greenback rose 0.34
percent against the yen to 81.83 .
 Trichet's comments countered data showing vibrant growth in
euro zone and British services sector, giving more evidence of
inflationary pressures and the likelihood they will not ease
anytime soon. [ID:nLDE7121H1]
 U.S. economic data, including better-than-expected weekly
jobless claims, higher worker productivity and new orders
received by U.S. factories also helped drive copper and tin
prices to record highs. A recent Reuters poll also points to a
supply deficit in copper for the coming year. [MET/POLL]
 But in the wake of Trichet's comments, the strengthening of
the U.S. dollar dug into the gains in commodity markets.
 After briefly touching $10,000 on the London Metal Exchange
on Thursday, copper closed at $9,930 a tonne against $9,945 at
Wednesday's close. Trading was muted due to the week-long Lunar
New Year holiday in China.
 ""A lot of the data that's come out today has been
supportive for commodities,"" said Daniel Smith, an analyst at
Standard Chartered. ""It's all telling us the macro picture's
pretty strong globally.""
 Brent crude rose to a 28-month high above $103 a barrel
before dropping back to trade at $101.92, off 0.41 percent on
the day . U.S. light sweet crude fell 0.41 percent to
$90.49 a barrel .
 STOCKS TAKE A PAUSE
 Global stock markets drifted lower, signaling a pause by
investors who have driven benchmark indexes to their best
levels in 29 months.
 ""It's a little premature to say that we are headed for a
correction, but we were certainly due for some consolidation
after this rally,"" said Brian Lazorishak, portfolio manager at
Chase Investment Counsel of Charlottesville, Virginia.
 In midday New York trade, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> fell 8.02 points, or 0.07 percent, to 12,033.95. The

 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading

weak results from heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell  and
Santander  were offset by the data showing the U.S.
economic recovery was gathering pace.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.29
percent from Wednesday's 29-month peak.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a seven-week
high of 3.55 percent. However, by midday, the 10-year note fell
7/32 of a point in price, leaving the yield at 3.52 percent

 By Bate Felix 
 LUXEMBOURG, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Suspected fake goods moving
through the European Union from a non-EU country can be seized
if there is a danger they could enter the trade bloc, an adviser
to the EU's highest court said on Thursday.
 The non-binding opinion by Advocate General Pedro Cruz
Villalon in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) centres on
complaints by Finnish mobile firm Nokia and Dutch conglomerate
Philips, which were referred by national courts.
 ""Non-community goods ... in transit from one non-member
country to another non-member country may be seized by the
customs authorities provided that there are sufficient grounds
for suspecting that they are counterfeit goods and in
particular, that they are to be put on the market in the
European Union,"" Cruz Villalon said.
 His opinion supported existing regulations which empower
customs officers to detain goods for a limited period -- even if
there is no conclusive proof they are fakes.
 Nokia had asked a British court to review a decision by the
country's customs agency not to seize 400 contraband mobile
phones in a shipment of goods from Hong Kong to Colombia, on the
grounds that they were not meant for the EU market.
 Britain's customs service, HMRC, was awaiting a final
ruling, but a spokesman said in a brief statement: ""The
(Advocate General's) opinion confirms that, while HMRC do not
have the power to seize suspect goods in the absence of judicial
proceedings, we can detain such goods for the period set out in
the regulation.""
 In the second case, the Belgian courts sought advice from
the European Court of Justice on a batch of fake Philips
electric shavers placed in transit in Antwerp, with no stated
destination.

 * Swaziland, Botswana, Namibia to take ""substantial"" hit
 * SACU document proposes 8-year adjustment from 2012

(Adds analyst, paragraphs 15-16)
 By Ed Cropley
 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Southern Africa Customs
Union (SACU) is considering a major overhaul of revenue-sharing
that will see South Africa keeping a far bigger slice of pooled
customs receipts, according to a policy document.
 Conversely, Swaziland, a landlocked absolute monarchy, will
see a ""substantial"" drop in its overwhelming source of revenue
and could ultimately be driven into bankruptcy.
 The review paper drawn up by an Australian consultancy and
obtained by Reuters on Thursday recommended an 8-year adjustment
period for the new revenue-sharing formula, starting in 2012, to
minimise the shock to already vulnerable economies.
 According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), SACU
revenues account for nearly two-thirds of official receipts in
Swaziland and Lesotho, just over a third in Namibia and 25
percent in diamond-rich Botswana.
 The world's oldest customs union, which celebrated its 100th
birthday last year, is still debating the proposals, under which
South Africa's share of pooled customs receipts would rise to 72
percent in 2019 from 50 percent in 2012.
 Africa's biggest economy accounts for around 85 percent of
SACU takings, but it pays out much of that to its smaller
neighbours under a complicated revenue-sharing formula that
dates back to 1969.
 The redistribution was officially devised as a way of
compensating its smaller neighbours for South African tariff
policy and its virtual monopoly on attracting external
investment thanks to its sheer size.
 However, the white-minority apartheid government that led
South Africa until 1994 also painted the SACU as an altruistic
subsidy of its poorer black neighbours to deflect international
criticism of its attitude towards blacks.
 Now that South Africa has a democratically elected
government, that argument no longer applies, and a recession in
2009 piled the pressure on Pretoria to halt what many South
Africans see as a bankrolling of its neighbours.
 
 SWAZI SQUEEZE
 Under the proposed revisions, Swaziland's share of SACU
receipts would fall to 3 percent by 2019 from 9 percent in 2012
-- cuts that will go down well with opponents of King Mswati III
but which could herald disaster for an already ailing economy.
 Botswana's share would fall to 6.7 percent from 17 percent
and Namibia's would drop to 9 percent from 15 percent.
 However, Lesotho, a mountainous kingdom entirely surrounded
by South Africa, would see its share rise to 9 percent from 8.5
percent, the document said.
 Despite the desire for increased revenues, the revision of
the SACU formula presents South Africa with a conundrum.
 A drop in funds could mean bankruptcy for Swaziland, which
already has one of the world's highest HIV/AIDS infection rates,
and South Africa would be likely to find itself picking up the
pieces as migrants flood across the border.
 ""Unfortunately it may be pretty short-sighted for South
Africa -- squeezing the other countries for something that
doesn't ultimately matter that much for South Africa,"" said
Razia Khan, head of Africa research at Standard Chartered.
 ""If there are countries that are in better economic shape on
its borders, that ultimately is good for South Africa.""
 Last April, credit rating agency Fitch cut its long-term
outlook on Lesotho to negative from stable, citing lower SACU
receipts as a result of South Africa's recession.

 * Subsidies should not distort the market or hit the poor
 
 (Adds quotes, links)
 By Silvia Aloisi
 ROME, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Market deregulation since 1999 has
fuelled speculation on commodities markets which , and that
needs to be corrected to curb food price volatility, the head of
FAO said on Thursday.
 ""We have created an environment that allows pure
speculation,"" FAO Director General Jacques Diouf told Reuters
Insider TV shortly after the agency said its closely watched
Food Price Index had climbed to a record high in January. 
 ""This is something that would require the necessary
corrections to allow still normal operations but not unlimited
speculation leading to great volatility in prices,"" he said. 
 ""I am calling for going back to the regulation that existed
(until 1999)."" 
 ""Buying on the future markets ... buying only the contract
and reselling it at higher prices without even seeing the
commodities, that is what is not right."" 
 He said the global market for agricultural commodities was
""neither free nor fair"", with trade barriers and subsidies in
advanced economies distorting the demand and supply balance and
hurting farmers in poor countries.
 ""It is not normal that OECD countries can provide every year
an average equivalent support of $365 billion to their farmers,""
said Diouf.
 ""I am not saying that farmers should not be supported -- all
farmers in the world, both developed and developing countries.
But it has to be done in a way that is not distorting to the
market and in a way that is also not jeopardising the livelihood
of poor farmers.""
 The FAO says the world needs to invest $83 billion a year in
agriculture in the developing world and raise overall output by
70 percent over the next 40 years to feed a global population of
9.1 billion in 2050.
 ""Unless we invest in agriculture ... we will not have a
situation that will preserve us from the shocks of tight supply
due to climate change in particular,"" Diouf said.
 Turning to foreign land purchases by private companies and
governments of food-importing countries, Diouf said it was
necessary to ensure these land deals were fair, transparent and
benefitted local communities and not just those investing money.
The FAO, along with other international organisations, has
been working on drawing up a set of principles for ""responsible""
investment in farmland. Diouf said negotiations on those
guidelines were at an advanced stage.

* Expert says list offers no legal certainty to states
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - European Union governments could
ban the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops to
maintain public order in the face of popular opposition to the
technology, the bloc's executive said in a draft document.
 Bans could also be justified on public morality grounds,
such as religious or philosophical concerns over GM technology,
according to a list drawn up by the European Commission as part
of plans to let states decide whether to grow or ban GM crops.
 The list was drafted after EU countries asked the Commission
to spell out the grounds on which they could justify proposed GM
crop bans. While it is not yet final, it gives a clear
indication of the Commission's likely recommendations.
""Such reasons ... could be invoked, alone or where relevant
in combination, by a member state to restrict or prohibit GMO
cultivation in all or part of its territory,"" said the document
drafted by the Commission's consumer affairs department and seen
by Reuters.
 Other possible reasons on the ""open list"" include
safeguarding the choice of producers and consumers to grow and
buy non-GM products, town and country planning decisions, and
preserving natural areas or traditional farming practices.
 When using any of the listed reasons as the basis for a ban,
EU states must ensure restrictions are ""justified, proportionate
and non-discriminatory"", the document added.
 The Commission drew up the list after several EU governments
voiced concerns that without solid legal arguments, national
cultivation bans could leave them open to legal challenges in
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
 By telling governments what arguments they might use to ban
GM crops, the Commission hopes to soften strong opposition from
several large EU states to its plan to devolve to national level
any decisions on allowing genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

 
 NO LEGAL CERTAINTY
 The list is set to be discussed by EU government experts in
Brussels on Feb. 11.
 A Commission spokesman said the EU executive would wait to
gauge the reaction from governments, but there were currently no
plans to amend the GM cultivation proposals and add the list to
the draft legislation.
One EU legal expert said that although the reasons on the
list were drawn from existing EU legislation and European court
rulings, the only way to make them legally secure would be to
add them to the draft legislation.
 ""Without that, the legal validity of this list is quite
questionable, and would not protect EU countries against legal
action by biotech companies, farmers or WTO trade partners,""
said Thijs Etty, assistant professor of EU law at VU University
Amsterdam.
 Even if the list was added to the legislation, most of the
reasons given are not valid under existing WTO regulations, and
countries will struggle to prove that national GM crop bans
based on such reasons are proportionate and non-discriminatory,
Etty added.
The Commission proposed giving governments the power to
decide on bans in July, in a bid to break a long-standing
deadlock in EU GM crop approvals which has seen just two
varieties approved for cultivation in more than 12 years.

* Use sovereign or corporate bonds, FX to avoid limelight
 * Funds move away from PIGS, target France, Germany 
 
 By Laurence Fletcher
 LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are steering clear of
hotly debated credit derivatives and reverting to more orthodox
bond plays so as not to invite more regulation from the many
politicians who blame them for the global financial crash.
 Fearing being seen as ""bringing down a country"", funds are
instead trading sovereign and corporate bonds as they hunt for
less controversial ways of making money from market volatility.
 ""The larger funds have been really cautious in trading CDS.
They don't want to find themselves in the newspaper, and let it
become an issue with their client base,"" said Jeff Holland,
co-founder of fund of hedge funds firm Liongate.
 Scouring through the track records and portfolios of
hundreds of fund managers, firms such as Liongate select other
funds to invest client money in, giving them a wide overview of
trading strategies used by hedge funds.
 At the height of Greece's debt problems in February last
year, Europe's second-biggest hedge fund firm Brevan Howard,
which now runs $32 billion in assets, told its investors it had
sold out of ""meaningful"" positions in CDS and bonds in Spain,
Portugal or Italy. The firm declined to give further details.
 ""Hedge funds have been playing the bond spreads, which is
less visible,"" said Philippe Gougenheim, head of hedge funds at
Unigestion, which invests in hedge funds. ""In the macro space
they're definitely active on the bonds.""
 While data on hedge funds' trades can be scarce, at the time
of the Greek crisis last year hedge funds accounted for 12-20
percent of CDS activity, according to one hedge fund industry
source, citing estimates from banks.
 Hedge funds sprang up when rich investors thought of ways to
hedge against losses in financial markets.
 Many critics say the funds are still too lightly regulated
and the largest funds fear further controversy could spark
tightening of the rules.
 Leading European politicians have blamed CDS -- a bet on the
creditworthiness of a borrower -- for aggravating the debt
crisis, allowing investors to speculate on a default rather than
protect against it, their original goal.
 
 INTERVENTION POWERS
 Europe is approving a law giving the European Securities and
Markets Authority powers to intervene in markets to ban
practices, including naked selling of CDS, where the buyer does
not own the underlying bond.
 That comes after an EU report -- which was not published,
despite protests from the hedge fund industry -- on sovereign
CDS last year largely exonerated CDS markets for putting
pressure on bond prices.
 To avoid the risk of tighter regulation, many hedge funds
are buying or short-selling sovereign bonds -- even of countries
as seemingly stable as France and Germany.
 ""CDS is proving to be a more challenging market for traders,
considering that governments are indicating that they could well
change how the market is regulated,"" said Scott MacDonald, at
U.S.-based credit specialist Aladdin Capital.
 The play on more sovereign trouble is just too good to
ignore and funds are now looking beyond the so-called ""PIGS""
(Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain), which have already
yielded big profits for some investors as spreads widened.
 ""We're still seeing some funds using CDS but a lot have
diversified because of politics and uncertainty in the
regulation of CDS,"" said Ben Funk, head of research at fund of
funds firm Liongate, adding that cash bonds and currency also
offer better liquidity.
 He added: ""The general consensus is that there's more pain
to go (for indebted European countries)... A lot of managers
have taken off short Portugal or Spain positions, where it's
almost a given there's going to be problems, and have moved to
France or Germany.
 ""In those countries the spreads are so tight, but should
there be instability in the periphery they'll move.""

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled on Thursday as
odds for a near-term interest rate rise diminished, while
violence in Egypt and upbeat economic data combined to push oil
above $103 a barrel and copper to a record $10,000 a tonne.
 Fighting between demonstrators and those loyal to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak diminished risk appetite for stock
investors who are weighing whether it is time to lock in
profits after a 29-month rally.
 Global food prices measured by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organisation hit their highest level since records
began in 1990. Rising food costs have been a key driver of the
turmoil in Egypt and Tunisia that is threatening to spill over
to other countries. For details, see [ID:nSGE71203E]

 The euro dropped 1.22 percent to $1.3634  and 0.90
percent to 111.59 against the yen. The greenback rose 0.34
percent against the yen to 81.83 .
 U.S. economic data, including better-than-expected weekly
jobless claims, higher worker productivity and new orders
received by U.S. factories helped drive copper and tin prices
to record highs. A recent Reuters poll also points to a supply
deficit in copper for the coming year. [MET/POLL]
 After briefly touching $10,000 on the London Metal Exchange
on Thursday, copper traded down to $9,907 a tonne at 1530 GMT,
against $9,945 at Wednesday's close. Trading was muted due to
the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in China.
 Brent crude rose above $103 a barrel before dropping back
to trade at $101.80, off 0.53 percent on the day . Crude
traded in New York fell 0.56 percent to $90.35 a barrel
.
 In U.S. stocks, prices fell from the start, unable to
capitalize on the positive economic data.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 39.46 points,

 * U.N.'s Ban says piracy poses threat to trade routes
 
 By Adrian Croft and Jonathan Saul
 LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.N.'s maritime agency called
for a new drive against piracy on Thursday as officials and
shipowners voiced fears that the growing scourge of Somali
pirates was outpacing international efforts to deal with them.
 The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) action plan,
which calls for closer international coordination of military
and civilian efforts against piracy, comes at a time of growing
concern over the expanding reach, ambition and firepower of
Somali-based pirates.
 ""Piracy seems to be outpacing the efforts of the
international community to stem it,"" United Nations Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon told delegates at the launch of the plan at
the London headquarters of the IMO.
 Ransom payments of hundreds of millions of dollars had
created a ""pirate economy"" in some areas of Somalia and
insurance premiums were on the rise, Ban said.
 ""The threat to international trade routes is clear,"" he
said, calling for action to support alternative jobs to piracy
for Somalis, including rehabilitating coastal fisheries.
 The IMO's plan called for efforts to build up the capacity
of states in pirate-infested regions to bring pirates to
justice, but is short on specifics.
 
 FRUSTRATION
 Speakers at the launch reflected frustration in the shipping
community at the growing threat the pirates pose to key shipping
lanes and vital oil supply arteries in the Indian Ocean despite
the deployment of international naval ships there.
 ""The situation has worsened during the past years with
fiercer and increasing attacks on ships. The increased use of
so-called 'mother' ships has enabled the pirates to operate at a
vastly greater range,"" said Robert Lorenz-Meyer, president of
BIMCO, the world's largest private shipowners' association.
 ""Today there are more than 700 seafarers held hostage for
ransom on 32 ships ... This does not speak well for the
effectiveness of the measures taken by the international
community,"" he said.
 Separately, the owners of the ""Beluga Nomination"", a cargo
ship hijacked by Somali pirates on Jan. 22, said this week
Somali pirates had shot dead a crew member.
 Lorenz-Meyer appealed to the U.N. Security Council to
increase the naval presence in the Indian Ocean and to make it
easier to prosecute detained pirates.
 ""Without robust and effective counter-measures, piracy will
... make the use of this important sea lane an unacceptable risk
to ship owners,"" he said.
 David Cockroft, general secretary of the International
Transport Workers' Federation, a union grouping representing
seafarers, said many crew members were at breaking point because
of the stress of passing through the area frequented by pirates.
 ""If the risks cannot be eliminated, then seafarers will
demand not to sail into the area at all and responsible ship
owners will support them,"" he said.
 There would never be enough navy ships to counter the
pirates in the vast ocean, he said, calling for ""robust
political and military intervention"" onshore in Somalia, led by
the key states in the region.

 * Gap in expectations normally no more than three months
 * Growing risks even if central expectations unchanged
 * Credibility issue complicates forecasts
 
 By Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A widening gulf between analysts
and the market on the timing of a Bank of England rate hike
suggests the risk of an extreme outcome -- a hike this month or
next -- is rising, even if the market is overshooting somewhat.
 The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters,
published on Tuesday, was for rates to stay at a record-low 0.5
percent until the final quarter of 2011, when analysts see a
hike to 0.75 percent. Only 21 of 67 respondents thought the BoE
would raise rates before the fourth quarter. [ID:nLDE7100Q5]
 By contrast, Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rates
 were on Wednesday night pricing in a 20 percent
chance of a hike at next week's meeting of the Monetary Policy
Committee, and were fully discounting a 25 basis point rise in
May, with rates seen around 1.20 percent by the end of the year.
 This gap of roughly half a year between analysts and the
market over the BoE's first hike is huge and unusual -- in the
past, the difference has rarely been more than one quarter.
 The next reading of the SONIA market, on Thursday night, may
show even stronger expectations for a rate hike, as it will come
after a purchasing managers' survey of Britain's services sector
from Markit/CIPS.
 The survey, released on Thursday morning, showed the
headline services activity index grew at its fastest pace for
eight months in January; this was not a surprise, but the survey
also showed a record jump by input cost inflation in the
services sector. [ID:nLDE7120WD]

 OVERSHOOTING
 Overshooting by the market probably explains some of the gap
in expectations; after many months in which investors saw little
need to hedge against a rise in interest rates, they are now
piling into the market to do so, distorting prices.
 Part of the gap, however, is probably due to the natural
reluctance of analysts to recalculate forecasts that they have
only recently made, and to the time taken to do so. The pattern
of economic data releases over the past few weeks may have
encouraged this slowness.
 This week's Reuters poll of analysts showed no change in the
median forecast from the last poll two weeks previously; news on
Jan. 25 that gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank 0.5
percent in the last quarter of 2010 may have reassured analysts
who would otherwise have shifted to predicting an earlier hike.
 But the purchasing managers' survey for the services sector
-- and similarly strong January surveys of the manufacturing and
construction sectors released on Tuesday and Wednesday -- now
suggest weakness in the last quarter may simply have set the
economy up for a stronger rebound this quarter.
 There is also the possibility that analysts are trapped by
their central predictions. Polls capture what economists see as
the most likely interest rate at a given point in time, but do
not capture growing risks that they may see to their forecasts.
 Recent comments by many analysts have recognised these risks
by acknowledging an unusually wide range of possible scenarios.
 ""February is in play, but on balance I think the MPC will
probably hold off because the GDP number gives them the excuse
to,"" said Ross Walker, economist at RBS.
 ""Even if they don't go in February, I am not sure we're
going to have until May. The Inflation Report could tee us up
for a March or April hike and the logic for that would be that
they may just want to wait another month to see whether we can
sustain these sort of levels.""
 
 CREDIBILITY
 One factor increasing the uncertainty is that when the
nine-member MPC announces its decision next Thursday at 1200
GMT, it may have put much more emphasis than normal on the issue
of ""credibility"" -- a political and social concept rather than a
purely economic one.
 The MPC will have updated inflation and growth forecasts
next week, and these are likely to show consumer price inflation
accelerating to around 5 percent in coming months, more than
double the central bank's 2 percent target.
 Much of that will be due to last month's rise in the Value
Added Tax and the spike in oil prices above $100 a barrel. BoE
Governor Mervyn King has insisted the central bank will not
react to short-term fluctuations in inflation and GDP as it is
more concerned about long-term stability.
 Some other members of the MPC, however, seem increasingly
concerned about the BoE's reputation as an inflation-fighter. If
its credibility is seriously damaged as a result of inaction on
interest rates, the result could be a panicky leap in
longer-term bond yields that would damage the economy more than
an official interest rate hike.
 MPC member Andrew Sentance, who has been voting for higher
rates since last June, was joined last month by Martin Weale.
Deputy Governor Charles Bean hinted on Wednesday that he might
be on the brink of joining the hawks. [ID:nLDE7110IV]
 For others on the MPC, January's decision to hold rates
steady was ""finely balanced"", according to minutes of the
meeting. The minutes showed most members felt the balance of
risks to the medium-term inflation outlook -- the basis for
monthly policy decisions -- had moved upwards. [ID:nLDE70P0SV]
 ""Those minutes were set up for a committee that was actively
thinking of moving in February, or if not, in May,"" said Moyeen
Islam, strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ""Would they go in February? It seems unlikely, but the BoE
has been known to suprise the market in the past."" In January
2007, the BoE raised rates at least a month earlier than most
analysts had expected.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply on
Thursday after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet said inflation expectations in the euro zone remain
firmly anchored, dampening speculation of an interest-rate
hike.
 Trichet's comments, which came after the ECB's decision to
keep interest rates at a record low 1 percent as expected,
disappointed investors who had expected a more hawkish
statement after recent inflation data came in above forecast.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3655 on trading platform EBS
, moving further away from a 12-week high of $1.3862
set on Wednesday. It last traded at $1.3666, down 1 percent on
the day.
 Trichet said euro zone inflation is likely to climb further
and could exceed the central bank's target for most of the year
but poses no threat yet to medium-term price stability.
[ID:nLDE7120I5]
 ""The underlying message is that there is no need for a rate
hike anytime soon,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
currency research at GFT in New York.
 Expectations that the ECB would raise interest rates ahead
of the U.S. Federal Reserve had boosted the euro against the
dollar in recent weeks.
 The spread between German and U.S. two-year bond yields
narrowed to around 69 basis points after Trichet's comments
from around 75 basis points before the press conference.
 Against the yen, the euro lost 0.7 percent to 111.80 yen
.
 Some traders said the euro could rebound if Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke, who is due to speak at 12:30 p.m. (1730
GMT), reaffirms the Fed's focus on boosting growth, which could
reignite talk the ECB could tighten monetary policy ahead of
the Fed.
 Losses in the euro pushed the dollar index <.DXY>, which
tracks the greenback versus a basket of currencies, up 0.6
percent at 77.624, above a 12-week low of 76.881.
 Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit, said
investors may be taking a more neutral position on the dollar
after its hefty losses earlier in the week, given the political
turmoil in Egypt and the risks of unrest spreading to other
Middle East countries.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 81.78
.

 By Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc's iron strength is
set to have a greater adverse impact than expected on the 2011
results of companies reporting in the currency, with some bears
predicting earnings growth will be half that forecast.
 Although Switzerland's export-oriented machinery and luxury
goods makers have benefitted from a general global recovery and
drug groups and food giant Nestle have made it through the
financial crisis, Swiss companies may now become victims of
their currency's success.
 It is Switzerland's safe haven status which has driven the
Swiss franc to record highs against the dollar and the euro,
threatening companies with overseas profits.
 The ""Swissie"" ended last year some 12 percent in real terms
above its 2009 average when measured against a basket of
Switzerland's 40 most important trading partners. And it was
more than 20 percent above its pre-crisis low of 2007.
 There is no real sign of this run reversing as the euro zone
debt crisis and uncertainty about the U.S. recovery boost the
currency's appeal as a safe port during uncertain times.
 So while investors and analysts are factoring in strong
performances from dependable Swiss companies, some seem to be
underestimating the franc's potential damage to earnings.
 ""We suspect that EPS (earnings per share) growth estimates
for the Swiss market are too high given currency headwinds,"" Jon
Cox, head of research at Kepler Capital Markets, told Reuters.
 ""EPS growth of 5 percent is more realistic rather than close
to 10 percent expected currently,"" Cox added.
 Companies in Switzerland's blue-chip SMI index are expected
to post earnings growth of 9.9 percent in 2011, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecasts. That compares with a
consensus 15.5 percent rise in earnings from the benchmark STOXX
Europe 600 index.
 The euro's relative weakness has been a boon for European
exporters, including many German companies, driving sales in
developing markets and making them more competitive at home.
 
 EARNINGS SQUEEZE
 The Swiss earnings season began in earnest last week with
pharma group and index heavyweight Novartis and most firms are
expected to report higher profits and rising revenue.
 But at the same time, Switzerland's manufacturers are
suffering from what the Swiss National Bank has called an
extraordinary challenge for exporters.
 A first batch of results has given a taste of what could be
in store in 2011, with chocolate maker Barry Callebaut,
watchmaker Swatch and specialty chemicals group Sika all seeing
the franc hitting sales.
 In the case of toilet flush manufacturer Geberit, a demand
rise in the fourth quarter translated into falling revenue in
Swiss franc terms, while luxury group Richemont -- which reports
in euros but produces mostly in Switzerland -- warned the franc
was eating into margins.
 Brokerage Kepler has cut its EPS forecasts to take into
account the impact of the strong franc, with the largest
downgrades an 11 percent reduction at drugs industry supplier
Lonza and a 7 percent cut for its EPS estimate at
dental-implants producer Straumann.
 Meanwhile, Vontobel analyst Panagiotis Spiliopoulos has
quantified the potential impact on the whole market.
 ""If the euro falls by three cents, this narrows the earnings
of Swiss companies (listed on the main bourse) by a cumulative
800 million francs,"" Spiliopoulos said.
 The franc's strength has also seen more and more analysts
reconsider their view on some of the Swiss heavyweights. 
 More than half of Swiss blue chips saw their 12-month
forward EPS cut by analysts over the last month, I/B/E/S shows,
while analysts raised forecasts for a majority of the companies
on the STOXX Europe 600 index.
 The world's number 2 cement-maker Holcim, which has
benefitted from strong growth in India and China, was cut to
'sell' by Citi due to currency headwinds.
 ""We believe the market has not taken into account the effect
of the strong Swiss franc,"" Citi analyst Aynsley Lammin said,
adding that although structurally nothing was wrong, valuations
looked a little stretched.
 Swiss companies are not alone in feeling the pinch. Swedish
truckmaker Scania warned on Wednesday that the strong Swedish
currency would dent its first quarter.
 The world's largest food group Nestle may not escape either.
Nomura put it on 'reduce', predicting a 3.7 percent franc hit
for the KitKat makers' 2010 earnings. If the franc were to
remain at early January levels, Nestle could see a translation
hit of 9 percent for its 2011 results, Nomura said.
 Even Switzerland's all-important banks and wealth managers
will not be immune from the squeeze. Despite strong inflows
during the euro zone debt crisis, a large portion of these
assets are denominated in euros and dollars.
 ""We'd also expect a negative effect on the bottom line for
the private banks such as Julius Baer or Sarasin, because a
large portion of the costs are booked in francs,"" said Vontobel
analyst Tobias Bruetsch.
 Helvea analyst Peter Thorne is similarly bearish and has cut
his EPS forecast for 2011 for Julius Baer, the Alpine country's
biggest dedicated wealth manager, by 5 percent.

 By Rajendra Jadhav
 MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's efforts to calm inflation
by allowing easier imports and restricting exports of key
foodstuffs are disappointing farmers who are keen to exploit
global high prices and say structural reforms are the way ahead.
 The cost of food for families in Asia's third-largest
economy has soared 17 percent over the past year, data showed on
Thursday showed, boosted most recently by gains in onions and
other everyday vegetables as harvests are hit by unseasonal
rains.
 Worldwide, food prices are touching record highs and worries
about damage from poor weather have led to warnings that costs
could rise still further, with shortages of key staples such as
rice and sugar already biting.
 World food prices hit a record high in January, the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organisation's Food Price Index showed on
Thursday.
 India's coalition government of Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh, under pressure after a series of corruption scandals and
with an eye on state elections this year, slapped an export ban
on onions and removed import duty to ease the pain for
consumers.
 In the past few years, the government has also scrapped
import taxes on sugar and lentils, and lowered duties on edible
oils.
 At the same time, to augment supplies in the local market,
it has banned exports of non-basmati rice or common rice, wheat
and lentils. Exports of sugar, cotton, aromatic rice and edible
oils also face restrictions.
 That is bad news for farmers in India, one of the world's
biggest producers and consumers of food, who argue that the
problem is not shortages of production but poor infrastructure
and profit-taking.
 ""The government is over-concerned about middle-class
consumers. It is abruptly changing trade policy of farm
commodities, which is hurting farmers,"" Raju Shetty, a farmers'
leader and member of parliament from the regional Swabhimani
Paksha party, told Reuters.
 
 SUPPLY CHAIN WOES
 Retailers agree that high prices in the market need a
different approach to tame them.
 ""An inefficient supply chain is stoking food price
inflation. Consumers are paying higher prices, but farmers are
not benefiting from it,"" said Shirish Deshpande, vice-chairman
of the consumer forum Mumbai Grahak Panchayat.
 ""The government should do more to check excessive profiting
by middle men,"" he said.
 Onion prices, for example, can triple in the distribution
chain from field to table.
 Farmers are also angry that the government failed to support
them when harvests were bad and is now interfering to keep
prices low for consumers.
 ""The government is not giving us compensation for crop
damage. Then it should allow prices to rise so we can recover
some of the losses caused by last season's crop loss,"" said
Sakahari, a 65-year-old onion farmer from Nashik, the biggest
onion producing belt in the country in western Maharashtra
state.
 The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) has called on the
government to allow 500,000 tonnes of unrestricted exports, to
take advantage of high international prices.
 ISMA's move echoes demands by sugar millers like Shree
Renuka Sugars, Balrampur Chini, Bajaj Hindusthan and Triveni
Engineering & Industries. They are struggling to pay farmers
higher prices for cane due to lower sugar prices in the local
market.
 Sugar prices in India are hovering around $595 per tonne
compared to levels around $845 for London futures.
 Farmers in western Maharashtra state, the biggest producer
of sugar, last October burned trucks and attacked sugar mills in
protests demanding a higher price for their sugar cane.
 Like sugar, farmers groups have also been demanding an
increase in export quotas for cotton, which it set at 5.5
million bales for 2010/11 season that began on Oct. 1.
 ""Indian cotton is cheaper by around a quarter if we compare
it with international prices. The government should allow
exports of surplus output,"" said Vijay Jawandhia, a farmers'
leader, who organised a protest rally in Nagpur, Maharashtra, in
January.
 Wheat and rice exporters are also seeking concessions on the
exports front as government-owned granaries are spilling over.
 On Jan. 1, India's wheat stocks stood at 21.5 million tonnes
against a target of 8.2 million tonnes. The rice inventory was
25.6 million tonnes versus a target of 11.8 million tonnes.
 The government, with an eye on a rising budget deficit, is
anxious to ensure stocks of such basic foodstuffs after a
drought in 2009 forced it onto the global market to buy sugar at
high prices.
 ""The government should find out other ways to minimise the
pinch of higher food prices. Banning exports and allowing
duty-free imports is not a solution. It will not help in the
longer term in raising local production,"" said a senior official
at a multi-national grains trader.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar
on Thursday, with investors booking profits and as markets
awaited the European Central Bank's latest comments on inflation
after it kept interest rates on hold, as expected.
 The euro could rebound if U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke, who is due to speak at 1730 GMT, reaffirms the Fed's
focus on boosting growth, reinforcing expectations the ECB will
raise rates ahead of the Fed.
 Analysts said an upward revision to a euro zone services PMI
and lower yields at a Spanish debt auction were positives for
the euro, but the focus on the ECB's monthly meeting meant the
currency barely reacted.
 Market players will be looking for further hints on when
euro zone rates might rise, given ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet's recent warnings on the need to tackle inflationary
pressures. Accelerating inflation and funding problems for
peripheral banks are set to top the agenda at the meeting..
 Trichet's news conference is due to start at 1330 GMT.
 ""The future trajectory of the euro/dollar rests on Trichet's
shoulders,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at
Forex.com. ""If he picks up where he left off back in January and
highlights the upward risks to inflation that would be euro
positive and we could see euro at $1.40 in the coming days.""
 She added that if, on the other hand, he argued the spike in
inflation and risks to growth were temporary, the euro could
come under pressure.
 The single currency shed 0.4 percent on the day to trade at
$1.3753, moving away from a 12-week high of $1.3862 hit on
Wednesday though still more than 7 percent above a four-month
trough of $1.2860 hit less than a month ago.
 Traders said offers were lined up at $1.3830 with talk of an
options barrier at $1.3900. Ahead of $1.40, the euro faces
resistance around $1.3950, marking the 76.4 percent retracement
of its two-month decline to early January as well as its
200-week moving average.
 The dollar index was up 0.2 percent at 77.329, not far above
a 12-week low of 76.881.
 Stephan Maier, currency strategist at Unicredit, said
investors may be taking a more neutral position on the dollar
after its hefty losses earlier in the week, given the political
turmoil in Egypt and the risks of unrest spreading to other
Middle East countries.
 
 RISK FACTORS
 Some analysts said expectations of hawkish ECB rhetoric may
have built too much, leaving room for disappointment and posing
downside risks for the euro.
 ""The market is looking for confirmation of a more hawkish
Trichet, though the risk/reward is that there is the potential
for disappointment,"" said Lauren Rosborough, currency strategist
at Westpac.
 She said further gains could leave the euro on track to test
$1.40, but falls due to a more dovish line than expected from
Trichet, or from safe-haven dollar buying due to concerns about
unrest in Egypt, could push it towards last week's low around
$1.3530.
 Another risk factor for the euro was an EU summit due on
Friday. EU finance ministers agreed last week to take their time
over beefing up the euro zone's rescue fund, in a go-slow
approach championed by Germany that could test the patience of
investors.
 Euro/dollar implied volatility for one month inched up to
11.85 percent from around 11.45 percent on Wednesday, but one
options trader says there had been little interest in topside
protection.
 Sterling hit a three-month high against the dollar of
$1.6279 after strong UK services PMI data bolstered the case for
higher interest rates.
 While interest rate differentials are seen playing a big
role, one currency pair that has seen a breakdown in correlation
with yields is the dollar/yen, which was up 0.13 percent at
81.67 yen.

 By Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet
 PRAGUE, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank held
interest rates on Thursday but came close to raising them as it
weighed rising inflation risks, surprising markets and sending
the crown currency to 27-month highs.
 Governor Miroslav Singer said the board agreed inflationary
pressures were more of a threat than the last time policymakers
met on rates in December, and the board also saw them somewhat
higher than the bank's staff forecast.
 The bank voted 4-3 to keep rates on hold at record low of
0.75 percent where they have stood since last May. The ranks of
dissenting board members calling for a quarter-point rate rise
grew from just one at the previous meeting.
""Practically the entire board agreed that it sees
pro-inflationary risks a little bit higher than the last time,""
Singer told reporters.
 The Czechs have yet to follow the Polish and Hungarian
central banks down monetary tightening cycles after more than
two years of loosening to nurse economies through the global
downturn.
 No analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the Czech bank to
raise rates this month, though the majority expect the bank to
begin increasing them in the second quarter and markets are
pricing this in in the first half.
 The Czech crown gained more than half a percent after the
central bank's news conference, breaking below the psychological
level of 24 to the euro and hitting its highest since November
2008. It traded at 23.94 versus the euro by 1500 GMT.
 Rates on 2-year interest rate swaps rose 6 basis points to
2.26/31 percent. A 3x6 forward rate agreement, which indicates
3-month interest rates in three months' time, rose 9 basis
points.
 Board member Pavel Rezabek said last month rates may rise
faster, joining hawkish colleague Eva Zamrazilova.
 The bank will reveal the voting record next Friday, and it
may give further clues on its next policy move as the terms of
Rezabek and another board member, Robert Holman, will expire
later this month.
 Before Thursday's meeting, markets were already pricing in
at least three quarter-point rate hikes this year, which many
analysts have said was too bullish.
 ""It may appear that the hawkish wing is being formed within
the Board - but, caution, for two of the members who we think
voted today for the hike (Rezabek and Holman) this was the last
meeting and we do not know if they're going to be re-appointed,""
Martin Lobotka, analyst at Ceska Sporitelna, said in a report.
 ""Also, the forecast itself isn't overly bullish - certainly
not so much as the market thinks.""
 
 INFLATION TICKS UP
 Inflation rose to 2.3 percent year-on-year in December,
above the midpoint of the bank's target of 2 percent plus/minus
one percentage point.
 But the crown has gained a central European-leading 8.7
percent in the past year, helping curb inflationary pressures --
something policymakers including Singer have acknowledged.
 The bank's new quarterly staff forecast raised its outlook
on economic growth this year to 1.6 percent from a previous
forecast of 1.2 percent.
 It said the policy-relevant inflation rate would rise early
this year before hovering around the bank's target, while
headline inflation would be around the target for the next 18
months.
 The staff forecast sees market interest rates roughly stable
this year before they start rising at the end of 2011.

 MINSK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Belarus must quickly take steps to
reduce the current account deficit from last year's estimated 16
percent of gross domestic product, the International Monetary
Fund said on Thursday.
 The Fund urged the former Soviet republic to tighten
monetary policy and stop foreign currency borrowing from local
banks by its central bank.
 ""The current account deficit is too high,"" an IMF mission,
which has completed a visit to Belarus, said in a statement late
on Wednesday.
 ""The government and the National Bank of the Republic of
Belarus should take action quickly to bring it down.""
 The Fund this week urged Belarus to raise interest rates and
cut government lending to improve the current account.
[ID:nLDE7111QM]
 ""Our estimate of the current account deficit was about 16
percent of GDP in 2010 and if macroeconomic policies are
unchanged we project only a small reduction in the current
account deficit in 2011, reflecting an improvement in the terms
of oil trade with Russia following the December 2010
agreements.""
 The Fund said the main causes of the high current account
gap were a rapid credit expansion and a ""significant increase in
budgetary wages and salaries in late 2010"".
 Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko ran for office
for the fourth time on December 19 and won in a landslide vote
criticised by Western monitors who said the count was flawed.
 The weak current account balance could put more pressure on
the Belarussian rouble  which has weakened by about a
third within the last two years and trades at around 3,000 per
dollar on a market tightly controlled by the central bank.

 MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russia plans to start the
privatisation of Sberbank, its largest lender, in 2011, after
selling shares in rival VTB, the Kremlin's top economic aide
told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
 The government has said it plans to cut its stakes in
Russia's two top lenders to 50 percent to plug the budget
deficit, offloading 35.5 percent of VTB and 7.6 percent of
Sberbank by 2013. Sberbank CEO German Gref said last Friday that
the sale might not go through until 2012.
 ""We believe both VTB and Sberbank (privatisations) can start
this year, Sberbank later in the year,"" Arkady Dvorkovich told
Reuters Insider television on the sidelines of the Troika Dialog
Forum Russia 2011.
 ""The structure of the (VTB) deal will be defined in the next
few weeks.""
 In the biggest state asset sale since the 1990s, Russia is
seeking to raise $32 billion in the next three years by reducing
government stakes in a raft of companies, from oil firms to
banks.
 Dvorkovich said he supported public offerings over private
sales as the most effective way of proceeding with the
privatisation drive.
 ""From what I personally can see it (investor interest in
Russia) is big; we have weekly meetings with international
investors ... Public offerings will be more successful than
private deals.""
 Dvorkovich said tax increases and inflation were among the
main domestic threats to Russian economic growth.
 ""Inflation is still a problem. It's higher than we wanted it
to be,"" he said, but added that for the full year inflation
would still come in at under 10 percent.
 Government officials have admitted it will be tough to stay
within the full-year inflation target of just 6-7 percent.
Economy ministry officials have said a reading of up to 8
percent is more realistic.
 The rouble, which has been buoyed in recent days by oil
prices of over $100 per barrel, will likely continue to
strengthen against major currencies, Dvorkovich said.
 ""Most likely the rouble will continue to appreciate, but not
with high speed.""

(Adds details, reaction)
 By Kate Holton and Simon Johnson
 LONDON/STOCKHOLM, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Strong demand from
emerging markets and from smartphone users helped cellphone
operators Vodafone and TeliaSonera lift sales last year and give
cause for confident outlooks for 2011.
 Vodafone, the world's largest mobile operator by revenue,
nudged up its profit forecast for the year to end-March on
Thursday, while Sweden's TeliaSonera cheered investors with a
$1.6 billion share buyback, lifting its shares 2.9 percent.
 Vodafone's service revenues in the last three months of 2010
rose 2.5 percent, in line with market expectations, thanks to
strong demand in India and some improvements in Europe, although
analysts said concerns remained about the business on its home
continent.
 Vodafone has made some of the biggest bets on emerging
markets, including spending $11.1 billion in India in 2007 to
get a 67 percent stake in what is now Vodafone Essar.
 While demand is growing rapidly, the Africa, Middle East and
Asia Pacific division is still worth only 30 percent of group
sales. It grew 9.3 percent on an organic basis in the third
quarter, while European revenue edged up only 0.2 percent.
 The British-based firm said it now expects adjusted
operating profit for the year to end-March to be towards the
upper end of its previously stated 11.8 to 12.2 billion-pound
range ($19.1 to $19.8 billion).
 But Vodafone shares were down 0.9 percent at 175.5 pence by
0834 GMT, the weakest performer in a flat Stoxx 600 Europe
telecoms sector index.
 Liberum Capital analyst Mark James said the headline numbers
were good but noted that Europe was still tough and particularly
so in Spain. Other analysts reckoned that the Vodafone share
price was close to its fair value.
 Vodafone has also recently restructured its business to now
include the faster-growing Turkish market in its European
division. In its previous structure, European service revenue
was down 0.9 percent, following a fall of 0.8 percent in the
previous quarter.
 ""One of the reasons we are not more enthusiastic on Vodafone
is that its European operations, which generate some 70 percent
of group EBITDA, are still going backwards,"" James said.
 
 SMARTPHONES
 Nevertheless both Vodafone and Teliasonera said they had
benefited from increased demand for internet services. Mobile
operators initially struggled to profit from the explosion in
data traffic but many, including Vodafone, are now retreating
from flat-rate tariffs.
 Vodafone's data service revenue rose 27 percent in the last
three months of 2010, while Telia said seven out of every 10
phones it sold in Sweden were now smartphones, whose users spend
more time surfing and using premium services, boosting revenues.
 Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said: ""Our
performance has been driven by the effective execution of our
strategy to strengthen our businesses and deliver growth,
particularly in data services and emerging markets.""
 TeliaSonera, Europe's fifth-biggest operator by market
value, said it expected sales in local currencies excluding
acquisitions to grow 4 percent this year, though the strong
Swedish crown could impact reported figures.
 ""This will mainly be driven by mobile data in the Nordic
region, increased market share in Spain and higher mobile
penetration in Eurasia,"" the company said in a statement.
 Vodafone's improved outlook followed solid trading in its
fiscal third quarter, with strong growth in India and Turkey and
improvements in Britain, Germany and South Africa.
 However, the Spanish market was worse than expected, with
revenues down 7.4 percent. 
 Its business in Spain, which grew strongly for several years
before the recession hit, has been particularly affected by
thousands of migrant construction workers leaving the country
and cancelling their contracts. 
 The group did add subscribers in the third quarter but with
prices falling due to competition its revenues slumped. In
contrast TeliaSonera, which has held onto customers by offering
lower rates in the first place, said it expected to grow further
in Spain.
 TeliaSonera, which has also seen a growing share of income
in recent years from markets like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and
Azerbaijan, said its overall costs would grow less than sales,
and its core profit margin should rise compared with 2010.
 On Thursday British fixed-line operator BT and Danish
operator TDC said they had also benefited from cost cuts and
some analysts suggested investors should switch from Vodafone to
BT.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2011 04:16AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-India's stance on key food trading," NEW DELHI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's
coalition government is battling high food prices, largely
a result of a spurt in the cost of vegetables --
as harvests were hit by rains -- and dairy
products. 
 Food inflation in Asia's third-largest
economy rose 17.05 percent in the year to Jan. 22,
while the fuel price index climbed 1 1.61 percent.
[ID: nSGE71203Q ] 
 Food prices worldwide are hitting record highs and
worries about damage from poor weather have led to warnings that
prices of key grains could rise further this year, with
shortages of staples such as rice and sugar already biting. 
 But India, where around 42 percent of the population
lives on less than $1.25 per day, has overflowing grain
bins and sugar output is forecast to jump in
the new season that began in October after a normal monsoon
in 2010 . 
 The government continues to worry about food security,
however, after a drought in 2009 forced it to import sugar,
sending global prices sharply higher. 
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee will present the
federal budget on Feb. 28. and analysts believe he may unveil
measures aimed at keeping a lid on prices.	
 
 Following are key facts about important farm commodities:
 
 GRAINS	
 - On Jan. 1, the country's wheat stocks were at 21.5 million
tonnes against a target of 8.2 million tonnes . 
 R ice inventory surged to 25.6 million tonnes
against a target of 11.8 million tonnes.	
 - India, the world's second-biggest wheat producer, does not
allow overseas sales. The country banned wheat exports in 2008
to tame high food prices. The export ban is likely to continue
despite the country heading for a record wheat
production in 2011, the fourth year in a row when
output will exceed demand.	
 - India , the world's second-biggest producer of
rice, is likely to continue with curbs on exports of
the staple. India banned exports of common
grades of rice in 2009 to bolster domestic supplies. 
 The government permits overseas sale of
aromatic basmati rice priced above $900 per tonne. 
 - India does allow the sale of
small amounts of grains under diplomatic deals to
neighbours. Last year, the country allowed exports of 300,000
tonnes of common rice and 200,000 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh.
It ha s also permitted the sale of grains to
Nepal and Maldives.	
 - India does not allow futures trade in
rice. 
 - The government is likely to free more grain stocks for
subsidised sale to the poor. In December, the federal government
freed up 5 million tonnes of wheat and rice for sales to states
and bulk consumers as part of efforts to curb rising food
prices.	
 
 SUGAR	
 - India, the world's biggest producer behind Brazil,
has flip-flopped on unrestricted exports, popularly
termed Open General Licence (OGL) sales , of 500,000
tonnes of sugar.	
 In December, a minister said mills
could export 500,000 tonnes of sugar. But the
government, bowing to public pressure over food
prices, has referred the issue to a panel of
ministers. 
 Industry body the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA)
has called for the government to allow the exports immediately
to take advantage of high global prices.
[ID: nDEL000076 ] 
 - The government is forecasting production at 24.5
million tonnes of sugar in 2010/11, up from 18.8
million tonnes a year earlier . ISMA is
forecasting 25.5 million tonnes of output. 
 - Mills are already exporting some white sugar to
meet an obligation against imports of raws since 2004.	
 - Mills need to export close to 1 million tonnes of white
sugar before March to meet the obligation. 
 - India relaunched sugar futures trading in December
after it lifted a ban introduced in May 2009 when it faced
shortages. 
 
 EDIBLE OILS	
 - India, the world's top buyer of vegetable oils, is
expected to continue with duty-free imports of crude varieties.
The country has no immediate plans to impose an import
tax on edible oils, as any such move would stoke prices.	
 - Indian trade bodies want the government to impose a
10-17 percent import tax on oils to ensure higher prices
for local producers on prospects of a good domestic oilseed
crop.	
 
 LENTILS	
 - India is the world's largest producer of
lentils and a big consumer. It allows duty-free
imports to bridge its supply shortfall.	
 - Imports come from Australia, Canada and Myanmar.	
 - The policy of duty-free imports is expected to continue as
lentils are an important source of protein for most Indians.	
 - India does not allow futures trading in two varieties of
lentils. Introduction of futures trade in the two grades depends
on domestic output. Unseasonal rains in November may hit lentil
harvests.

 * But some point to risks of more profit-taking in euro

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro was steady, hovering not
far below a 12-week high on Thursday as the market awaited a
European Central Bank meeting and news conference, where hawkish
comments could give it a further boost.
 The euro could gain even more if Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke, who is due to speak only a few hours after ECB
chief Jean-Claude Trichet, reaffirms the bank's policy is still
focussed on boosting growth.
 However, some suspect expectations of hawkish ECB rhetoric
may have built up too much, leaving room for disappointment and
posing downside risks for the single currency.
 Market players will be looking for any hints on when euro
zone interest rates might rise, given Trichet's recent warnings
on the need to tackle inflationary pressures. Accelerating
inflation and funding problems for peripheral banks are set to
top the agenda at the meeting.
 ""The market is looking for confirmation of a more hawkish
Trichet, though the risk/reward is that there is the potential
for disappointment,"" said Lauren Rosborough, currency strategist
at Westpac.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3790. It slipped on
profit-taking after marking a 12-week high of $1.3862 on
Wednesday, though it is more than 7 percent above a four-month
trough of $1.2860 hit less than a month ago. Traders cited talk
of an options barrier at $1.3900.
 Rosborough said further gains could leave the euro on track
to test $1.40, but falls due to Trichet disappointment, or from
any safe-haven dollar buying due to concerns about unrest in
Egypt, could push it towards last week's low around $1.3530.
 The ECB announces its policy decision at 1245 GMT, with a
news conference at 1330 GMT. Market players were also wary ahead
of auctions of Spanish and French debt.
 ""I think the market expects the ECB to be hawkish. But as
the euro has already risen quite a lot, market players are
cautious about chasing it higher,"" said Tsutomo Soma, a manager
of foreign bonds at Okasan Securities in Tokyo.
 Similar risk also exists for the speech from the Fed chief,
due at 1730 GMT, if he turns out to be less dovish than many
market players have hoped.
 Many market players do not expect the speeches from the
world's two most influential central banks to change the
perception that the ECB will be way ahead in raising rates.
 The dollar index was steady at 77.147, near a 12-week low of
76.881.

 RATE FOCUS
 Growing expectations that high inflation could force the
Bank of England to raise interest rates sooner rather than later
pushed sterling to a three-month high versus the dollar of
$1.6245.
 The Australian dollar also performed well after strong
Australian trade data, rising 0.5 percent to $1.0133, though the
New Zealand dollar fell 0.6 percent after weak New Zealand jobs
numbers.
 While interest rate differentials are seen playing a big
role in currency transactions, one currency pair that has seen a
breakdown in correlation with yields is the dollar/yen, which
was steady at 81.78 yen.
 The yield on U.S. two-year notes, which had strong
correlation with dollar/yen moves last year, has almost
completely lost its link to dollar/yen in the past month.
 ""The market seems to no longer be looking at yield gaps.
What's we are seeing is that investor buying of bonds is
dwindling. Instead, their money seems to be heading for
commodities,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Bank in Tokyo.

 * Oil shipments were halted over legality of contracts
 
 (Adds byline, comments from officials, background)
 By Shamal Aqrawi
 ARBIL, Iraq, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Iraq started exporting crude
on Thursday from the Kurdish region's Tawke oilfield, a major
step toward resolving fierce disputes between the war-torn
country's majority Arabs and minority Kurds, officials said.
 Shipments from the Tawke oilfield operated by Norway's DNO
International and Turkey's Genel Enerji began at 10,500 barrels
per day and were expected to reach 50,000 bpd in two to three
days, officials at Iraq's North Oil Company said.
 Exports from the semi-autonomous Kurdish region briefly
flowed in 2009, but were halted when the Iraqi government in
Baghdad refused to pay the companies involved. Baghdad views oil
contracts signed by the Kurds with foreign firms as illegal.
 The impasse over oil is part of a broader dispute over land,
power and the distribution of the country's natural wealth that
U.S. military officials fear could one day spark a war in Iraq.
 ""This morning we registered 10,500 bpd of Kurdish exports
from the Tawke field,"" said one North Oil Company official, who
asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to
speak about the matter.
 ""This is the first shipment of crude officially registered
for the Kurdish authorities,"" the official said.
 A senior North Oil Company, who also asked not to be
identified, said exports from Tawke to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan were expected to rise to 50,000 barrels per day in the
next two to three days.
 Shares of DNO rose 3 percent after the company said it had
started test production for exports from Tawke.
 Once exports fully resume, shipments from Tawke and a second
field, Taq Taq, operated by Chinese company Sinopec and Genel
Enerji, should reach 100,000 bpd. For a FACTBOX on companies
involved in the region, click on.
 Exports from the region were stopped over the dispute
between Iraqi Kurdistan and the Arab-led government in Baghdad
over the legality of contracts awarded by the Kurds to foreign
companies.
 Earlier this year, the two sides said they had reached a
deal. Under the agreement, first proposed by Baghdad last year,
the Iraqi government will pay the companies for their
exploration and development costs but not cover their profits.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2011 04:04AM ET</span>",Euro zone PMIs jump but divergence persists," * Euro zone service sector grows faster than initial estimate
* New business grows at fastest pace in over 3 years
* Composite PMI suggests Q1 growth of 0.7-0.8 percent
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro zone's dominant service
sector expanded much faster than initially thought in January as
new business boomed, but the figures masked a continued
underlying divergence among member states, a survey showed on
Thursday.
 The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
which measures changes in activity at thousands of companies
ranging from hotels to banks, rose to 55.9 in January from 54.2
in December, higher than an earlier flash estimate of 55.2.
 The service sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of
the euro zone economy, saw new business growing at a rate not
seen since August 2007, with the index bouncing to 55.9 from
December's 53.9.
 Any reading above 50 signifies expansion.
 But the upturn in numbers was driven by a buoyant Germany
which far outshone poor results in other members of the
17-nation bloc.
""The divergence between national service sector performance
-- ranging from near-record growth in Germany to minor
contractions in Spain and Italy -- looks likely to remain a
headache for policymakers at the ECB,"" said Chris Williamson at
data provider Markit.
 The German-led recovery is coming at a price, with inflation
rising sharply above the European Central Bank's target,
presenting it with the dilemma of how to support struggling
economies while maintaining price stability.
 There has been no clear consensus among economists as to
when the ECB will first raise rates, with medians over the last
three Reuters polls flip-flopping between the fourth quarter of
this year and the first three months of 2012.
 But all 82 of the economists polled by Reuters expect the
ECB to leave rates on hold at 1.0 percent when it meets later on
Thursday.
 Markit's Eurozone Composite PMI, which combines the service
sector data with manufacturing figures released on Tuesday that
showed that sector gained momentum last month and is often used
as a gauge for economic growth, also rose from December.
 The main index jumped to 57.0, its highest level since
April, and up from December's 55.5 and a flash reading of 56.3.
 ""The data signal the best start to a year for three years,
consistent with GDP growth accelerating to a quarterly pace of
0.7-0.8 percent,"" Williamson said.
 The composite employment index slipped for the third
consecutive month, dipping to 52.1 from December's 52.5, but
spent its ninth month above the break-even point.
 Official data released on Tuesday showed unemployment in the
euro zone remained roughly steady at 10.0 percent in December,
hovering near a 12-year high for the seventh month running.

 By Gyles Beckford and Mantik Kusjanto	
 WELLINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - New Zealand's government will
slash spending and borrowing to help keep interest rates low and
weaken its rising currency, the finance minister said, as a
surprise jump in unemployment threw up yet another hurdle to its
sputtering economic recovery.	
 ""We believe that a tighter fiscal track will lead to lower
interest rates and lower exchange rate,"" Bill English told
Reuters in an interview on Thursday.	
 Data earlier in the day showed the economy shed 11,000 jobs
in the fourth quarter, sending unemployment up to 6.8 percent
from 6.4 percent in the previous quarter.	
 Analysts said it would have topped 7 percent if the
workforce had not shrunk, compared with the OECB average of 8.6
percent. Economists polled by Reuters and the RBNZ had forecast
a 6.4 percent rate.	
 The dissapointing jobs figures suggest policymakers will
likely stay the course in efforts to boost economic growth,
prompting investors to set back expectations for the timing and
magnitude of interest rate rises this year.	
 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has held its key interest
rate at 3.0 percent since September last year as the economy has
struggled to pick up momentum and households and businesses cut
spending. Unlike many other developed nations, the economy has
shown few signs of gaining traction in recent months. 
 ""The labour market's weaker than the Reserve Bank
anticipated and there's no need to increase interest rates
anytime soon. We're still picking a September hike,"" said
Westpac senior economist Dominick Stephens.	
 The New Zealand dollar shed around half a cent to a
low of $0.7720 before paring its losses to stand at $0.7730. It
has rallied about 10 percent in the last year, threatening to
add to the economy's woes by weighing on export competiveness. 
 Interest rate futures <0#NBB:> rose as much as eight points,
and the short term swaps fell as markets pushed back
the timing for the resumption of rate rises by the RBNZ. 
 The often-volatile jobs data came after a slew of recent
weak economic indicators, including soft retail sales and
building activities, although recent surveys have shown
improving hiring plans. 
 
 
 NO RATE RISES SOON 
 The main drag in employment came from a 2.8 percent drop in
part-time employment, overshadowing a 0.3 percent rise in
full-time job growth.	
 The jobless rate has swung wildly between 6 percent and 6.9
percent over the past year, although analysts suspect some of
the volatility is due to statistical anomalies.	
 The RBNZ has said interest rates will remain low until the
recovery gains momentum, but with a steady stream of
disappointing numbers analysts have been pushing back the timing
of that tightening, with the consensus now settling on September
from the previous pick of July.	
 Market assumptions about the extent of monetary tightening
over the next 12 months fell to 57 basis points (bps) from 68
bps. It has fluctuated between 48 and 70 bps over the past
month. 
 New Zealand's growth is expected to gradually pick up pace
later this year, helped by the rebuilding of the Canterbury
region after last year's earthquake and by spending for the
Rugby World Cup.	
 Surveys last month by the NZ Institute of Economic Research
and the National Bank of NZ have shown businesses were expecting
to hire more staff.	
 
 TIGHT PURSE STRINGS	
 Finance Minister English said moving back into budget
surplus by 2014/15 as pledged by the prime minister last week
would be a challenge, but was attainable as long as the economy
picked up the pace.	
 He said keeping a tight rein on spending and reducing
borrowing would help to support low interest rates and activity.	
 ""We'd hope to arrest the growth in the stock of debt...we
want it to peak earlier and lower,"" he said.	
 English said he expected government borrowing to slow after
the budget, usually in May, and hoped a return to surplus sooner
would also keep the lid on debt. 
 New Zealand has struggled with anaemic growth since emerging
from its longest recession in 30 years in 2009, and the economy
unexpectedly contracted in the third quarter last year, raising
the prospect of a double-dip recession, which English said he
hoped would be avoided.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The euro paused below a 12-week peak
on Thursday, though hawkish comments from the European Central
Bank later in the day could give it fresh impetus to test
resistance around $1.3950.
 The euro could gain even more if Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke, who is due to speak only a few hours after ECB chief
Jean-Claude Trichet, reaffirms that the bank's policy is still
focusing on boosting growth.
 The euro traded at $1.3805, having slipped on profit-taking
after it hit a 12-week high of $1.3862 on Wednesday.
 Comments from a German government official that Berlin
opposed allowing a euro zone rescue fund to buy troubled
countries' debt helped trigger profit-taking on Wednesday, though
Germany later signalled its readiness to boost the fund's size.
 The euro moved little in Asia on Thursday, with many Asian
players away for the Lunar New Year holidays and as traders
looked to Trichet's news conference at 1330 GMT.
 ""I think the market expects the ECB to be hawkish. But as the
euro has already risen quite a lot, market players are cautious
about chasing it higher,"" said Tsutomo Soma, a manager of foreign
bonds at Okasan Securities.
 Some market players suspect the market's expectations of
hawkish rhetoric from Trichet has built up so much that there is
room for disappointment, posing downside risk for the single
currency.
 Similar risk also exists for the speech from the Fed chief,
due at 1730 GMT, if he turns out to be less dovish than many
market players have hoped.
 Still, Fed Governor Elizabeth Duke said late on Wednesday
that although she does not think the U.S. central bank will have
to extend its $600 billion bond-buying programme beyond midyear,
economic weakness could force the Fed's hand.
 Many market players do not expect the speeches from the
world's two most influential central banks to change the
perception that the ECB will be way ahead in raising interest
rates to curb inflation.
 That should keep euro zone interest rates much higher than
dollar rates, and help the euro test resistance around $1.3950,
where it has a 76.4 percent retracement of its two-month decline
to early January as well as its 200-week moving average.
 Expectations of a credit tightening are also helping the
British pound stay close to a three-month high. Sterling stood at
$1.6194, not far from Wednesday's three-month high of $1.6232.
 While interest rate differentials are seen playing a big role
in currency transactions, one currency pair that has seen a
breakdown in correlation with yields is the dollar/yen.
 The yield on U.S. two-year notes, which had strong
correlation with dollar/yen moves last year, has almost
completely lost its link to dollar/yen in the past month.
 The U.S two-year bond yield rose to its highest in nearly a
month on Wednesday but that had a limited impact in boosting the
dollar versus the yen and the one-month correlation of the two
assets is now close to zero.
 ""The market seems to no longer be looking at yield gaps.
What's we are seeing is that investor buying of bonds is
dwindling. Instead, their money seems to be heading for
commodities,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Bank.
 Indeed, Japanese government data showed Japanese investors
became net sellers of foreign bonds last week for the first time
in six weeks.
 Worries about inflation -- the enemy of bonds as it eats into
their real value -- helped to push 30-year U.S. bond yields to a
nine-month high on Wednesday.
 Kitakura said the rising tide of money flows to commodities
will keep supporting commodity currencies such as the Australian
dollar.
 The Aussie rose 0.1 percent to $1.0110, inching closer to a
one-month peak of $1.0149 marked earlier in the week.

while commodities markets raced even higher, adding to worries
of mounting inflationary pressures that could threaten the
global economic recovery.	
 North Sea Brent crude futures rose nearly a dollar
to $103.27 per barrel, the highest in 28 months, after
supporters of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak opened fire on
protesters, in what many saw as an official crackdown on
anti-government demonstrations. 
 Fears that unrest in Egypt and Tunisia will spread to other
countries in the Middle East and threaten the region's oil
exports overshadowed the bearish effect of soaring gasoline
inventories in the United States, prompting investors to move to
safer assets, or the sidelines.	
 In currency markets, the euro paused below a 12-week
peak, though tough talk on the inflation from the European
Central Bank after its monthly meeting later in the day could
give it fresh impetus to test resistance around $1.3950. 
 Higher energy prices along with copper, sugar and cocoa
prices at or near record highs have put a sharp dent in appetite
for riskier assets such as emerging market equities as investors
fear price pressures will get out of control.	
 In fast growing countries such as Brazil, India and China,
worries have grown that policymakers will need to tighten
monetary policy aggressively to tame rising consumer prices,
which could put a dampener on a key driver of the global
economy.	
 ""The current strong pace of activity is clearly not
compatible with comfortable and stable levels of inflation,
underscoring the urgency of continued monetary policy
tightening,"" said Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India &
ASEAN at HSBC, in a report on India's services sector.	
 The report showed business activity in the country's
services sector grew at a faster pace in January than the month
before, but the input price index hit a 30-month high.

 Higher prices for raw materials are already squeezing
corporate profit margins. While many firms appear able to pass
those costs on for now, sharp spikes will eventually force
consumers to cut back on spending.	
 U.S. candy maker Hershey Co reported overnight that
it was seeing ""meaningfully higher"" costs for ingredients such
as cocoa and sugar, while Australia's Qantas announced
a round of fuel surcharges on Thursday. 
 
 Japan's Nikkei fell 0.3 percent, easing slightly
after posting its biggest jump in two months the day, as
investors took a more cautious stance and awaited key earnings
results and Friday's U.S. payrolls data.	
 Shares of Panasonic Corp fell 3.2 percent after it
posted a worse-than-expected drop in quarterly profit as tough
price competition and a stronger yen offset help from Japan's
incentive scheme for eco-friendly appliances. 
 Overall, foreigners remained net buyers of Japanese stocks
for a 13th straight week on optimism that the U.S. and global
economies are gathering momentum.	
 Developed market shares are likely to outperform those in
emerging markets over the next six months, until it is clear
inflation is under control, said Shane Oliver, chief investment
strategist at AMP Capital Investors.	
 U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected in
January, the 12th consecutive month that companies took on
staff, adding to hopes that the American labour market is slowly
recovering and bolstering hopes for the more comprehensive U.S.
jobs report on Friday. 
 Elsewhere in Asia, Australia's main share benchmark
rose 0.5 percent as strong metals prices continued to support
shares of resources firms. Mining giants BHP and Rio
Tinto both rose more as copper prices stayed just shy
of $10,000 a tonne, with supplies tight against strong demand.	
 But regional trading was thin overall, with markets in
Greater China, South Korea and much of Southeast Asia closed for
Lunar New Year holidays.

 * Building approvals jump on multi-unit building
 * Bodes well for economic growth last quarter, and 2011

 By Wayne Cole	
 SYDNEY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Australia boasted its ninth
straight month of sizable trade surpluses in December as demand
from China kept key commodity prices at dizzying heights while
dire weather had less impact on shipments than feared.	
 The surplus on goods and services amounted to A$1.98
billion ($2 billion) in December, down only slightly from A$2.1
billion in December and beating forecasts of $1.6 billion.	
 The surplus for all of 2010 was a record A$16.6 billion and
historically high prices for iron ore and coal bode well for an
even bigger bonanza this year, even accounting for recent heavy
floods which disrupted coal production and exports.	
 ""It really has been an extraordinary year,"" said Brian
Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie.	
 ""The floods will have more impact on coal volumes in
January,"" he added. ""But the outlook for prices is extremely
bullish and the terms of trade could rise another 15 percent
this year, which is massive.""	
 
 Exports edged up 0.3 percent in December by value to A$24.6
billion, while imports rose 0.8 percent to A$22.6 billion.	
 Volumes of iron ore and coal defied the weather to rise in
December and looked to have outstripped imports for the whole
quarter. That suggests net exports added to Australia's A$1.3
trillion in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth
quarter, after dragging on growth the previous quarter.	
 For 2010, export earnings were up a hefty 22 percent. This
embarrassment of riches is boosting profits, jobs, incomes and
tax receipts while funding a huge pipeline of resource projects.	
 That in turn is a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) is expected to hike interest rates again in coming months
as it seeks to manage the mining boom's inflationary threat.	
 Most analysts suspect the central bank will move again in
the second quarter , though futures markets <0#YIB:> are
leaning toward later in the year.	
 
 EYES ON CHINA	
 One reason for market caution is that the run of pre-emptive
rate hikes from the RBA -- seven in 14 months -- has worked to
restrain consumer spending while underlying inflation slowed to
a decade-low last quarter.	
 Higher mortgage rates have also cooled the housing market,
with home prices only inching higher last quarter. Government
data out Thursday showed approvals to build new private houses
were flat in December, to be barely changed for the quarter.	
 Still, a steep 21.3 percent jump in multi-unit approvals did
help lift overall approvals by 8.7 percent, well above analyst
expectations of a 1.8 percent increase. That could suggest that
credit for large apartment projects is becoming easier to find.	
 More importantly, the RBA has its sights fixed very much on
the industrialisation of China and India and the urbanisation
their two billion people, which are likely to drive demand for
Australia's commodity exports for years to come.	
 Australian exports to China in the last six months of 2010
were up 57 percent on the prior six months, giving it a surplus
with the Middle Kingdom of A$10.5 billion. 
 And that is only likely to grow larger as the RBA's measure
of Australian commodity prices jumped 4.9 percent in Australian
dollar terms in January, while reaching record highs when
measured in U.S. dollars.	
 Prices for Australia's biggest export, iron ore, have been
climbing since July as strong demand from Chinese steelmakers
meets limited supply. Spot prices are now near record highs atop
$185 <.IO62-CNI=SI>, which compares with $120 this time last
year and less than $60 in early 2009.	
Indeed, Australia's terms of trade -- the ratio of export to
import prices -- are at peaks not seen since the 1950s and are
60 percent higher than the average of the entire 20th century.	
 Since exports account for about one-fifth of the economy,
the terms of trade are generating a staggering 12 to 15 percent
of GDP in additional income every year, or roughly A$150-200
billion annually.

Kirk will be pressed to lay out President Barack Obama's trade
priorities for 2011 when testifies before a congressional trade
panel next week, a Republican congressman said on Wednesday.
 ""I look forward to hearing Ambassador Kirk in his first
appearance before the committee as he lays out the president's
trade priorities,"" House of Representatives Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dave Camp said in a statement.
 Camp said he would press Kirk next Wednesday on when the
White House plans to submit free trade pacts with South Korea,
Panama and Colombia to Congress for votes.
 The hearing will also focus on China trade concerns,
prospects for finishing the Doha round of world trade talks,
U.S. trade negotiations in the Asia Pacific and Russia's bid to
join the World Trade Organization, Camp said.
 Kirk has never testified in public before the House Ways
and Means Committee although he has been Obama's chief trade
negotiator since March 2009.
 That reflects the low priority that Democrats put on
approving the three pending trade agreements when they
controlled the House from 2007 through 2010.
 In contrast, Camp said he wants to start action on all
three agreements in the first six months of this year.
 Obama, who has had frosty relations with business, is
scheduled to speak on Monday to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as
part of a new White House outreach efforts.
 The U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization,
Michael Punke, said last month he expected Obama to address
trade issues in that speech.

 * Oil keeps climbing as Egypt protests turn violent
(Updates with U.S. closing prices)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - World shares struggled to eke
out more gains on Wednesday as wariness over escalating
violence in Egypt and rising oil prices muted optimism over the
latest signs of a sustained global economic recovery.
 The price of copper, a key industrial metal, hit a record
high on expectations of strong global demand.
 Brent crude earlier topped more than $102 a barrel, a
28-month high, on worries that the flare-ups in Egypt could
spread across the Middle East and North Africa, source of more
than a third of the world's oil.
 Prices of U.S. crude futures had slipped after data showed
that U.S. stockpiles rose for a third straight week, but
finished moderately higher. U.S. light sweet crude oil <2CLc1>
rose 9 cents to settle at $90.86 per barrel.
 ""While the oil market wants to move lower on the bearish
(inventory) data, it can't break away from worries about
Egypt,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in
Chicago.
 ""The latest pictures of Egyptian demonstrations becoming
violent have added to those worries,"" Flynn said.
 The dollar, a traditional safe-haven currency, rose against
the euro on the unrest in Egypt and on signs of dissent over a
euro zone rescue plan.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>, one
of the broadest gauges of global equities, rose 0.22 percent
after earlier hitting levels last seen in August 2008.
 ""Just like everyone else, we are monitoring Egypt very,
very closely in the event we need to make adjustments,"" said
Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles, which has more than
$150 billion in assets under management.
 Emerging market shares <.MSCIEF> led gains, rising 0.4
percent. They are down more than 1 percent in 2011, however,
reflecting a shift by investors to developed markets such as
the United States, where key indexes on Tuesday hit their
highest closing levels in about 2-1/2 years.
 Equities were bolstered by a report by ADP Employer
Services on Wednesday that U.S. private employers added 187,000
jobs in January, more than forecast. On Tuesday, strong factory
data worldwide prodded U.S. benchmark stock indexes higher.
 But the civil unrest in Egypt remained a top concern as
violent clashes erupted between opponents and supporters of
President Hosni Mubarak in central Cairo.[ID:nLDE71100I].
 U.S. indexes ended little changed after a day of see-saw
trade. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 1.81
points, or 0.02 percent, to 12,041.97. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> slipped 3.56 points to 1,304.03 and the Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 1.03 points to 2,750.16.
 Appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  fell 2.1 percent to
$82.77 after its profit missed expectations. [ID:nN02176058].
 Time Warner Inc  rose 8.6 percent to $35.10 after
its profit topped estimates on a 21 percent jump in advertising
sales at its cable networks. [ID:nN02180792]. Mattel Inc
 rose almost 1 percent to $24.37 after its profit beat
expectations. [ID:nN01136189].
 ""The world economy appears to be improving a little faster
than expected, valuations are OK and companies are publishing
quite good results,"" Geert Ruysschaert, strategist at BNP
Paribas Fortis Private Banking, said. ""Investors can take
advantage of that.""
 Commodity prices continued to rise on improving global
growth prospects. Copper  hit a record high at $9,988.25
a tonne before settling back at $9,945.25.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.2
percent, marking a 3.5 percent year-to-date gain. Earlier,
Japan's benchmark Nikkei <.N225> ended up 1.8 percent for its
biggest daily gain since Dec. 2.
 Despite lingering Middle East tension, bids for some
safe-haven assets, including U.S. Treasury bonds, eased.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose 0.04 percentage
point to 3.48 percent as their prices fell. Treasuries were
pressured as rising energy and food costs fed worries over
inflation, which erodes the value of bonds over time.
 Gold  fell $3.60, or 0.3 percent, to $1,336.60 an
ounce, well below its December record high near $1,430.
 ""The sell-off seemed to illustrate that people had lost
faith in gold and could see much better places to invest,"" said
Peter Hillyard, an analyst at ANZ Bank in London. ""I don't
think people want to sell it,"" he added. ""They are fearful
about what is going to happen in the Middle East, and what
really is going on in the markets.""
 In currencies, the euro retreated from a 2-1/2-month high
against the dollar as signs of dissension over a euro zone
rescue plan caused some investors to take profits after a
recent rise.
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3861 overnight, its best
level since early November, but fell after a German government
official said Berlin opposed allowing a euro zone rescue fund
to buy troubled countries' debt.
 A downgrade of Irish government debt also prompted some
euro selling, but analysts said the currency remains in an
uptrend and may yet test $1.40 in the weeks ahead.
 ""There's a bit of a flare-up in Egypt, and some of our
barometers suggest a hint of renewed risk aversion, but I don't
think it will dissuade investment in high-yield assets,"" said
BNY Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk. ""And given how far the
euro has come, you would expect to see some profit-taking.""
 Dollar gains against major currencies were slight, even
after the U.S. private employment data. The U.S. Dollar Index
<.DXY> rose 0.05 percent to 77.104.
 The euro  fell 0.2 percent to $1.3805, and the dollar
rose 0.27 percent to 81.53 yen .

 * Pushes China on promise to increase legal software use
 * Implementation will be key focus in 2011, USTR says
 By Walter Brandimarte and Doug Palmer
 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke on Wednesday criticized China for failing
to honor promises to open its market and said the United States
would be pressing Beijing for better results in 2011.
 ""This type of behavior simply has to change,"" Locke said in
a toughly worded speech just two weeks after Chinese President
Hu Jintao met with President Barack Obama and members of
Congress in Washington.
 Locke said U.S. companies have concerns about China's trade
practices in a number of areas but ""the fundamental problem
often boils down to the distance between the promises of
China's government and its actions.""
 The stern tone reflects the pressure the Obama
administration is under to achieve meaningful results on the
ground for U.S. companies that have grown increasingly
frustrated with business conditions in China.
 U.S. officials said Hu made several promises during his
January visit, including that China would not discriminate
against products made with foreign technology when awarding
lucrative government procurement contracts.
 U.S. companies have worried that China's use of government
procurement preferences to encourage ""indigenous innovation""
would force them to transfer technology in order to compete in
the country's vast public works market.
 Locke highlighted a pledge Chinese officials made in
December to fight piracy of U.S. business software by
increasing budgets for government agencies and large
state-owned enterprises to buy legal versions.
 ""Of course, this dealt with a problem we thought we had
solved in 2006, when China issued a regulation requiring
government ministries to buy computers with licensed software
pre-loaded. They just never put any money behind the
commitment,"" Locke said at a conference organized by Bloomberg
News in New York.
 Locke, echoing a theme of Obama's State of the Union speech
last week, also said the United States needed to do more at
home to respond to competitive pressures from China.
 ""If you look at what China is doing, how they're focusing
on core industries, putting all their policy weight and
financial resources on specific industries ... they are really
moving and getting results,"" he said.
 ""We need a similar strategy with respect to U.S. education
policy, with respect to clean energy, transportation, you name
it,"" Locke said.
 Two senior U.S. trade officials echoed the need for tough
monitoring of China's recent trade promises at a briefing for
reporters in Washington.
 Hu's Washington visit capped a year of progress on Chinese
""indigenous innovation"" policies that threatened to keep U.S.
companies out of that country's huge government procurement
market unless they agreed to transfer valuable technology,
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis said.
 A major challenge in 2011 will be to ensure China actually
keeps its promise not to use government purchasing at the
central, provincial and municipal level to favor Chinese
companies that use home-grown technologies at the expense of
U.S. and other foreign firms, he said.
 The United States also will be keeping a close eye on
China's promises to increase use of legal software, crack down
on Internet piracy and to maintain an open market for 3G and 4G
telecommunication devices, said Claire Reade, assistant U.S.
trade representative for China.
""The follow-up is going to absolutely critical because
credibility matters and durability matters,"" Reade said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell from a
2-1/2-month high against the dollar on Wednesday as tensions in
Egypt escalated, though the euro zone single currency's uptrend
stayed intact given signs of rising inflation in that area.
 The euro climbed above $1.3860 overnight, its strongest
level since early November, before retreating after a German
government official said Berlin opposed allowing a euro zone
rescue fund to buy troubled countries' debt.
 Traders said winter storms in the Midwest and Northeast
were keeping trading ranks thin, while clashes in Egypt between
supporters and opponents of President Hosni Mubarak injected
some uncertainty into markets.
 The U.S. dollar, which usually benefits from safe-haven
buying, was only modestly bid, and traders said the euro
remains on track to test $1.40. An upside target before that
was seen at $1.3950, around the 200-week moving average.
 ""Unless you see a big contagion effect in the rest of the
Middle East, the euro is going to continue a little bit further
up,"" said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of currency sales at
Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
 The euro last fell 0.2 percent to $1.3804, after having
risen as high as $1.3862 on trading platform EBS. Support lies
at $1.3786, the Nov. 22 high.
 ""There's a bit of a flare-up in Egypt and some of our
barometers suggest a hint of renewed risk aversion, but I don't
think it will dissuade investment in high-yield assets,"" said
BNY Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk. ""And given how far the
euro has come, you would expect to see some profit-taking.""
 Sources say the euro zone is giving serious consideration
to letting its rescue fund buy debt from distressed countries,
though the German position was unclear.
 The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and investors
will scrutinize comments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
for clues about the bank's stance on inflation.
 The euro has gained more than 3 percent since the ECB's
last meeting on Jan. 13, when Trichet's comments on short-term
inflation pressures fueled expectations the European Central
Bank will lift interest rates sooner than the Federal Reserve.
 ""We expect the ECB to maintain its stance set in January
and continue to emphasize the need to monitor the short-term
upward pressure on overall inflation,"" strategists at BofA
Merrill Lynch Global Research in New York.
 Dollar gains against major currencies were slight despite
data showing U.S. private employers beat expectations and added
187,000 jobs last month.
 Traders said a downward revision to December's data
tempered enthusiasm and failed to alter investors' conviction
that U.S. interest rates will remain low indefinitely.
 The dollar was last up 0.3 percent at 81.56 yen and up 0.5
percent at 0.9398 Swiss francs.
 While U.S. data has improved -- a survey this week showed
manufacturing grew in January at its fastest pace since 2004 --
the Fed remains committed to stimulative monetary policy. An
official said another round of bond purchases could even be
discussed if economic recovery starts to flag.
 ING analysts argue the two-year euro swap rate at which
corporates hedge interest rate risk has limited room to extend
gains. It has pushed above 2 percent, 100 basis points over the
policy rate, which ING says is ""extreme.""
 ""The euro may have come about as far as it can on the ECB
story alone, and will need an alternative catalyst to punch it
through resistance in the $1.39-1.40 area,"" ING analyst Chris
Turner said in a note.

 * Tax reform part of effort to offset rising costs

(Adds finance minister, more Rousseff comments)
 BRASILIA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma
Rousseff told Congress on Wednesday that a major overhaul to
streamline the country's cumbersome tax system was essential to
ensure sustainable economic growth.
 The move is part of a broader effort by the Rousseff
administration, which took office on Jan. 1, to help offset the
rising cost of doing business in Brazil as interest rates are
set to rise further in coming months.
 The pragmatic career civil servant did not say whether she
would draft a new proposal or revive stalled bills in Congress.
But she said that the objective was to simplify and rationalize
the system, grant tax breaks to stimulate growth, investment
and demand for consumer goods. 
 In her first address to Congress since taking office,
Rousseff also pledged strict fiscal discipline to control
inflation.
 ""The continuation of a macroeconomic policy with fiscal
equilibrium, firm measures to control inflation and rigor in
the use of tax money will be one of the pillars of this
government,"" she said.
 The comments coincide with rising investor concern over
growing inflationary pressure and mounting expectations over
planned budget cuts to be announced next week.
 Forecasts for the benchmark IPCA consumer price index
[BRCPI=ECI], Brazil's most widely watched gauge of inflation,
climbed to 5.64 percent last week from 5.53 percent previously,
according to a weekly central bank survey published on Monday.
For details see [ID:nN31198051].
 The government hopes its planned budget cuts will take away
some of the stimulus driving growth and inflation, paving the
way for lower interest rates in the future.
 Finance Minister Guido Mantega said on Wednesday that the
government would meet its budget targets in 2011. The nominal
budget deficit would fall to 1.8 percent of gross domestic
product, down from 2.56 percent last year, Mantega said in a
speech to ministers in Brasilia.
 ""As we reduce government spending, (we) open room for
either tax breaks or for a reduction in interest rates,""
Mantega said.
 Finance Ministry officials are concerned that further
monetary tightening to curb inflation could attract more
capital inflows in a country already struggling with an
overvalued real  local currency, .
 A strong real has made it hard for producers to export
their goods while making it cheaper to import.
 ""We have to (induce) exports to grow more than imports,""
Mantega added.

(Updates with U.S. midday trading)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - World shares eked out gains on
Wednesday as escalating violence in Egypt and rising oil prices
painted a disturbing backdrop even as the latest data added to
evidence of a sustained global economic recovery.
 Brent crude earlier topped more than $102 a barrel on
worries that the flare-ups in Egypt could spread across the
Middle East and North Africa, source of more than a third of
the world's oil.
 By midday in New York, however, prices of U.S. crude
futures had fallen in volatile trading on rising crude and
gasoline stocks in the United States and as the dollar
strengthened.
 The dollar, a traditional safe-haven currency, rose against
the euro on the unrest in Egypt and on signs of dissension over
a euro zone rescue plan. U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell
6 cents to $90.71 per barrel. Brent also declined.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>, one
of the broadest gauges of global equities, rose 0.15 percent
after earlier hitting levels last seen in August 2008.
 ""Just like everyone else, we are monitoring Egypt very,
very closely in the event we need to make adjustments,"" said
Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles, which has more than
$150 billion in assets under management.
 Emerging market shares <.MSCIEF> led gains, rising 0.5
percent. They are down more than 1 percent in 2011, however,
reflecting a shift by investors to developed markets such as
the United States, where key indexes on Tuesday hit their
highest closing levels in about 2-1/2 years.
 Equities were bolstered by a report by ADP Employer
Services on Wednesday that U.S. private employers added 187,000
jobs in January, more than forecast. On Tuesday, strong factory
data worldwide prodded U.S. benchmark stock indexes higher.
 But the civil unrest in Egypt remained a top concern as
violent clashes erupted between opponents and supporters of
President Hosni Mubarak in central Cairo. Worries that the
protests could spread to other countries in the region have
pressured equities on and off in recent days. [ID:nLDE71100I].
 U.S. indexes traded little changed, with the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> dipping 0.46 points to 12,039.70. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> declined 3.03 points, or
0.23 percent, to 1,304.56 and the Nasdaq Composite Index

 Appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  fell 3.1 percent to
$82.77 after its profit missed expectations. [ID:nN02176058].
 Time Warner Inc  rose 2.25 percent to $34.56 after
its profit topped estimates on a 21 percent jump in advertising
sales at its cable networks. [ID:nN02180792]. Mattel Inc
 rose 2 percent to $24.62 after its profit beat
expectations on strong demand for its Barbie and American Girl
dolls. [ID:nN01136189].
 ""The world economy appears to be improving a little faster
than expected, valuations are OK and companies are publishing
quite good results,"" Geert Ruysschaert, strategist at BNP

 Commodity prices continued to rise on improving global
growth prospects with copper  hitting a record high at
$9,988.25 a tonne before settling back at $9,921.00.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 0.2
percent, off its highs but at a 3.5 percent year-to-date gain.
Earlier, Japan's benchmark Nikkei <.N225> ended up 1.8 percent
for its biggest daily gain since Dec. 2.
 Despite lingering Middle East tension, bids for some
safe-haven assets, including U.S. Treasury bonds, eased.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose 0.04 percentage
point to 3.48 percent as their prices fell.
 Gold  fell $10.72, or 0.8 percent, to $1,329.50 an
ounce, well below its December record high near $1,430.
 Peter Hillyard, an analyst at ANZ Bank in London, said
gold was lacking direction after its retreat from December's
record high above $1,430 an ounce.
 ""The sell-off seemed to illustrate that people had lost
faith in gold and could see much better places to invest,"" he
said. ""I don't think people want to sell it,"" he added. ""They
are fearful about what is going to happen in the Middle East,
and what really is going on in the markets.""
 In currencies, the euro retreated from a 2-1/2-month high
against the dollar as signs of dissension over a euro zone
rescue plan caused some investors to take profits after a
recent rise.
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3861 overnight, its best
level since early November, but fell after a German government
official said Berlin opposed allowing a euro zone rescue fund
to buy troubled countries' debt.
 Traders said winter storms in United States kept trading
ranks thin.
 A downgrade of Irish government debt also prompted some
euro selling, but analysts said the currency remains in an
uptrend and may yet test $1.40 in the weeks ahead.

 The euro  fell 0.33 percent to $1.3787. Against the
Japanese yen, the dollar  rose 0.49 percent to 81.71

 Simon Johnson
 STOCKHOLM, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Iceland's central bank
signalled on Wednesday that interest rates are close to
bottoming out after nearly two years of monetary easing as the
crisis-hit island aims at eventually easing currency controls.
 The currency controls were imposed in late 2008 to stop the
crown sliding further after the economy came close to collapse
when the heavily-indebted top three banks were taken over by the
state within a week.
 ""We are getting much closer to what might be considered to
be some kind of equilibrium rate, even taking into account the
slack in the economy,"" central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson
told Reuters after the bank shaved 25 basis points off rates.
 ""We are not necessarily saying that we have reached the end,
we are saying that the next move is more uncertain.""
 The rate cut on Wednesday took the key seven-day
collateralised lending to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent, down
from a peak of 18 percent over the last two years.
 The bank said in a statement that the direction of future
policy moves was uncertain as rates were at historic lows. The
prospect of removing the capital controls ""creates uncertainty
about short-term room for manoeuvre"", it added.
 The economy contracted 6.8 percent in 2009, but the picture
has slowly been improving since, thanks in part to aid from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European neighbours.
 ""The big news ... is not that the rate cut was smaller than
expected, but the MPC's statement implies that the monetary
easing that has been underway since the beginning of 2009 may be
at an end,"" Icelandic bank Islandsbanki said in a research note.
 ""It appears that the Committee is afraid of further ISK
depreciation."" 
 SEB strategist Mats Lindh said the cut was set to be the
last. ""I think the MPC (central bank Monetary Policy Committee)
is actually preparing for the beginning of the removal of
capital controls before the beginning of 2013, so they are
afraid of cutting rates too deeply,"" he said.
 
 ENDING CONTROLS TO TAKE TIME
 Gudmundsson said some limited moves to remove capital
controls could come within the next six months, but that lifting
all controls would take longer.
 ""We will start within that time frame, but how far we will
go is very much uncertain at this point,"" he said.
 The central bank will present the government with its advice
on how to proceed at the end of February.
 Gudmundsson said Iceland needed to meet certain conditions
before it could act, including macroeconomic stability,
sufficient foreign currency reserves and strong banks.
 ""We need the financial sector to be strong enough to
withstand ... the free movement of capital and that is where the
jury is still out,"" he said.
 The crown , which has weakened sharply against the
euro so far this year on uncertainty about the economic outlook,
showed little reaction to the rate cut, which was expected.
 The bank said that after an expected 2.7 percent contraction
in GDP last year, the economy would pick up again this year to
2.8 percent growth and more than 3 percent in 2012 and 2013.

 NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The euro retreated from a
2-1/2-month high against the dollar on Wednesday as questions
surrounding a euro zone rescue plan and unrest in Egypt caused
some investors to take profits on its recent rise.
 The currency climbed as high as $1.3861 overnight, its best

 * Commission to consider stockpiling critical raw materials
 
 BRUSSELS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The EU confirmed on Wednesday it
would consider stockpiling critical raw materials, but stopped
short of threatening retaliation against countries that restrict
supplies, a strategy document from the bloc's executive showed.
In earlier drafts of the paper, the European Commission said
any country that applied unjustified restrictions to raw
material exports would be removed from the EU's list of
preferred trading partners.
 But in the final version the Commission said it would:
""carry out further studies to provide a better understanding of
the impact of export restrictions on raw materials markets, and
foster a dialogue about their use as a policy tool"".
 Export restrictions on raw materials -- such as those placed
on rare earth minerals by China last year -- have left import-
dependent countries questioning how to ensure supplies of
materials essential for high-tech and defence manufacturing.
 Despite pulling back from the threat of unilateral
retaliation against export controls, the EU executive promised
to tackle supply barriers, preferably through dialogue, but if
necessary with legal action in the World Trade Organization.
 ""The aim is to try to solve problems which relate directly
to the future of European firms, industries and their ability to
innovate and compete,"" EU industry commissioner Antonio Tajani
told a news conference.
 The paper also called on the 27-nation EU to improve its
recycling technologies and stop millions of tonnes of raw
materials from leaving Europe each year in the form of scrap
electronics and cars.

assets worth around 2.6 trillion forints ($13.35 billion) from
mandatory private pension funds in the next months as part of a
revamp of the pension system, the funds said on Wednesday.
 The transfers, which are estimated to account for about 9
percent of gross domestic product (GDP), are expected to help
Hungary reduce its state debt and improve its budget balance.
 According to a bill passed late last year, the state will
receive the assets of fund members who did not declare by a Jan.
31 deadline their intent to stay in the funds at the expense of
losing their entitlement to pensions from the state.
Stabilitas, the association of the funds, estimates that
members who decided to remain with private funds own assets
worth up to 400 billion forints ($2.05 billion), national news
agency MTI quoted Stabilitas officials as saying.
 The assets held in the funds totalled 3.036 trillion forints
at the end of 2010, up 25.6 percent year-on-year, it said.
 The officials said only 4-8 of the country's 18 mandatory
private pension funds were likely to survive the changes, which
reversed a 1997 pension system reform.
 The effective renationalisation of mandatory private pension
funds is part of the centre-right government's unorthodox fiscal
policy measures criticised by the International Monetary Fund
and the European Commission. [ID:nLDE70R09I]
 The measures including ""crisis taxes"" on banks, retail,
energy and telecoms firms, are aimed at cutting the budget gap
below 3 percent of GDP, after successive years of deficit
overshoots ever since Hungary joined the EU in 2004.

 The sheer range of potential near-term scenarios, from
benign reforms that relieve social tensions and promote growth
to the collapse of order and all-out wars, means that the
simplest forecast for investors is to expect more volatility.
 Seeking templates, 1990s eastern Europe may offer some. But,
again, the key lesson may be how diverse the changes may be.
 Some experts predict the past month's largely unexpected
dramas -- the fall of Tunisia's strongman, impending departure
of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and political shifts in
Yemen, Jordan and elsewhere -- may presage seismic change across
the Arab world.
 Some see that as ultimately leaving the region a more stable
place to invest. Others are alarmed, fearing heightened risk of
conflict, militancy, extremism and oil supply interruptions.
 ""There are clearly some very different scenarios out there,""
said Lars Christensen, head of emerging markets analysis at
Danske Bank. ""There are those whereby you get liberalisation
across the Middle East that could be very market positive.
 ""But you also have the low probability-high impact scenarios
whereby you get disaster in countries like Saudi Arabia.""
 The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened up trade and
brought political reform and prosperity to dozens of economies.
But it also heralded a decade of civil war in the Balkans as
well as new regimes where investors struggle to secure returns.
 Realising the diversity of outcomes is crucial.
 ""Could you have predicted in 1989 that the Czech Republic
would do well and Ukraine less so?"" said Christensen. ""Perhaps.
 ""But you might still have been surprised by the unexpectedly
good performance of Poland -- and it was not a good time to be
in Yugoslavia.""
 
 OIL MARKETS WATCH
 Where to invest, and also when will be as vital as ever.
 Fortunes for investors in Russia alone proved hugely
volatile over the past 20 years -- which saw a coup, uprisings,
property and market booms, switches from near-anarchy to
authoritarianism, wars and energy supply interruptions.
 No model is perfect. Not only is the Middle East not eastern
Europe, the 2000-teens are not the 1990s. Times and tools have
changed. The rise of social media sites and Internet and mobile
phone penetration within the region complicate forecasting.
 Most analysts agree sites like Twitter acted as a political
accelerant, but with the technology so new few pretend they
genuinely know how it will affect events in the longer term.
 In trying to predict what comes next, experts are inherently
influenced by their own long-held assumptions, fears and hopes.
 Like the emigre Poles, Czechs and Russians who went home in
the 1990s, the Westernised Arab academics flying to Egypt now to
join protesters on the streets are full of hope they are seeing
the beginning of regional liberation. 
 But Western experts and policymakers who have spent the last
decade worrying about militancy focus their attention on violent
forces in the shadows, ready to take advantage of disorder.
 For now, the speed of events and the huge divergence of
potential opinions make it hard to gauge exactly what markets
expect. Oil markets look to be pricing in a modest heightened
risk of supply interruption, with Brent crude passing through
$100 a barrel from around $95 at the start of the year.
 But traders are watching closely and experts warn prices
could prove volatile in the coming weeks and months.
 ""Price breakouts due to geopolitical reasons have become
more likely,"" said Barclays Capital in a note, saying oil market
confidence over spare capacity last year looked to be ebbing.
 For oil traders, the main focus has been Egypt's Suez Canal
-- so far unaffected by onshore chaos -- but the elephant in the
room remains Saudi Arabia. 
 The probability a repeat of events in Cairo and Tunis in
Riyadh or Jeddah is still generally regarded as low -- albeit
higher than it was seen to be even only a couple of weeks ago --
but the potential global market impact would be huge.
 
 SAFER THAN BELGIUM, RISKIER THAN FRANCE
 Some talk up the risk. Like Egypt and Tunisia, Saudi has
ageing rulers and some disaffected populations, notably
reflecting regional and religious differences with the ruling
house. The Saudi royal family relies on a U.S.-armed military --
and Washington's approach to events in Egypt showed it can pull
support from long-term allies when the tide turns.
 Others say such parallels are overstated. They point to the
differences between the Gulf oil economies and poorer North
African states, citing the Saudi kingdom's huge oil wealth in
particular giving it more flexibility to placate the masses. 
 Credit default swaps (CDS) markets have been pricing in a
higher risk of sovereign default across the region, with rates
for Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Lebanon well over a third and
sometimes almost twice levels at the beginning of the year --
although most premiums have eased marginally since Friday. 
 Long-held assumptions of Saudi stability meant its CDS were
barely traded until mid-January, rising to 113 basis points
according to monitor Markit from a quoted 70 on Jan 18. 
 It would therefore cost $113,000 to protect $10 million Saudi
five-year debt against default or restructuring. That remains
well below Egypt's $355,000, Tunisia's $192,000, Morocco's
$193,000, Bahrain's $385,000 or Lebanon's $385,000 -- although
it is approaching Israel at $133,000.
 It also means the Saudi kingdom remains seen a better credit
risk than Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Ireland or even
Belgium, priced on Wednesday at 146 basis points.
 But after Egypt and Tunisia's revolts, the world's largest
oil producer is now priced riskier than France -- 87 basis
points -- and almost twice as risky as Britain where it costs
$60,000 to protect holdings of $10 million in government debt.

 * No firm decisions expected, aim is to build consensus
 * Improving EFSF bailout fund will be heart of debate
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
assess progress in tackling the year-long euro zone debt crisis
at a summit on Friday, with Germany expected to lead the debate
on a package of potential resolution measures.
 No breakthroughs are expected at the one-day meeting, with
many details of the ""comprehensive package"" still being worked
on. But policymakers are hoping the discussion will maintain
momentum in resolving a crisis that has already swamped Greece
and Ireland and still threatens Portugal and possibly Spain.
 After a year of trying to get to grips with the sovereign
debt fire, officials have been heartened by relative calm in
financial markets in recent weeks, but recognise that failure to
agree on concrete steps before the next scheduled summit on
March 24-25 could reignite the conflagration.
 Yields on Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Belgium 10-year
bonds have all fallen this week, and the euro has strengthened,
indicating a degree of increased confidence in the market.
 Friday's discussions are likely to focus on the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro fund
set up last May and used in November to bail out Ireland, with
officials focused on finding ways to increase its effective size
and make it more flexible.
 The summit will also try to build consensus among the 17
euro zone countries over the best options for resolving the
crisis beyond the EFSF, such as whether to lower the interest
rate on loans to Greece and Ireland, among other issues.
 Because of guarantees built into the EFSF to maintain its
triple-A credit rating, the fund can only lend about 250 billion
euros, not the full 440 billion. If several euro zone states
were to need bailouts, the fund would probably be insufficient.
 While the EFSF is the chief weapon in the EU's arsenal,
disagreement remains over how it should best be strengthened.
Germany, the EU's biggest economy and most influential decision
maker, is determined to secure budgetary commitments from euro
zone member states in exchange for changes to the EFSF.
 Among the ideas being proposed for improving the fund is to
allow it to buy the bonds of distressed euro zone states, either
directly in the primary market, or by lending money to states to
buy back bonds, sources have told Reuters.
 But a German government official, briefing in Berlin ahead
of the summit, appeared to close the door on such a possibility
on Wednesday, saying bond-buying wasn't a viable option.
 ""It is not in our interest that the EFSF can buy bonds,"" the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""This is not
practical.""
 The official added that Friday's summit should instead send
a signal on stronger economic coordination, saying it would take
no decisions on strengthening the EFSF.
 
 ""DEBT BRAKES""
 A discussion paper from Chancellor Angela Merkel's office
last week seen by Reuters laid out a series of measures Germany
wants the euro zone to adopt to improve competitiveness and
increase economic coordination in the euro zone.
 The measures included a ""debt brake"" law similar to
Germany's, designed to enforce budgetary discipline, moves to
raise the retirement age, rein in wage costs and develop a more
level playing field on corporate taxation.
 The proposals are likely to form part of Friday's
discussion, German officials have said, and could be included in
the ""comprehensive package"", which Germany hopes euro zone
member states will agree on by the end-of-March summit.
 France, which has allied itself closely to Germany during
the crisis, said on Wednesday it planned to reform its
constitution to introduce a ""golden rule"" on balancing the
budget, adding weight to Germany's position.
 With no concrete decisions expected on Friday, officials are
instead emphasising that the summit is an opportunity to ensure
all euro zone members are committed to the ""comprehensive
package"", which is emerging as once-and-for-all solution.
 There remains the risk, however, that Friday will underline
just how far apart states remain, with Germany largely backed by
the likes of France, Finland and the Netherlands, while Greece,
Italy, Spain and others pull in different directions.
 Euro zone officials have privately expressed reservations
about how slowly work is progressing and say they doubt whether
a complete package can be agreed by late March.
 Last week, euro zone sources said EU leaders were
considering holding an extra summit in early March to maintain
the momentum, with too many decisions needing to be taken
between now and the end-March target for the complete package.
 Friday's summit was originally set up to discuss energy
issues. While they remain on the agenda, the debt crisis and the
situation in Egypt are likely to dominate the discussion.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2011 09:48AM ET</span>",Yen to weaken vs dollar as U.S. outlook brightens -poll," * Yen to stay range bound over the next 12 months
 * Swiss franc to reach parity against the dollar in a year.

By Sumanta Dey
 BANGALORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The yen is expected to weaken
against the dollar by year-end, driven by improving U.S. news
but also held back by Japanese policymakers who are determined
to prevent the yen from rising sharply.
 For now, investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see stance
on the Japanese currency following the first downgrade of
Japan's sovereign credit rating since 2002, which took financial
markets by surprise last week.
 At the same time, the outlook for the U.S. economy has
improved dramatically in recent weeks even though interest rate
rises from the U.S. Federal Reserve are still nowhere on the
near-term horizon.
 In the monthly Reuters currency survey of more than 60
analysts, taken between Jan. 31 and Feb. 2, the dollar was seen
trading at 83 yen in a month and 86 in six months compared with
81.51 on Wednesday. Those consensus forecasts are largely
unchanged from the early January poll.
 The yen is seen trading at 90 in a year, although the
12-month consensus forecast for dollar/yen has been notoriously
inaccurate over past years, with analysts consistently too
negative on the yen's prospects.
 ""The yen was obviously shell-shocked by S&P's country
downgrade, but was not derailed,"" said Roberto Mialich, senior
currency strategist at Milan's UniCredit.
 The yen has long been perceived as a safe haven but some say
S&P's decision to downgrade Japan's long-term debt rating took
off some of that shine. The dollar rose about 1 percent against
the yen in the immediate aftermath.
 Mialich said dollar/yen would trade in an 81-83 ""no man's
land"" range over the next several months. 
 Japanese authorities have geared up to ensure there's enough
capacity to stem appreciation and to avoid a repeat of 2010,
when the yen surged 13 percent against the dollar.
 ""The BoJ has already introduced a new asset purchase scheme,
which can be expanded flexibly,"" said Meng Jiao, G10 FX
strategist at BofAML.
 To aid intervention, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) is set to
hike the borrowing cap at the Foreign Exchange Fund Special
Account by 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) to 150 trillion yen
($1.81 trillion) under the fiscal 2011 budget, added Jiao.
 In an extra question, asked to predict the 2011 year-end
dollar index level, the poll suggested a median of 80.5 from
more than 50 respondents.
 Japan, whose fiscal discipline is under increased scrutiny,
faces the twin challenge of managing its debt pile and ensuring
growth in an economy faced with persistent deflation. 
 In a G7 macro economic poll conducted by Reuters last month,
the country was expected to return to moderate growth in 2011
even as deflation was likely to persist until at least the
second quarrter of 2012. 
 Cross rates calculated by Reuters show the euro trading at
112 yen in a month, 112.5 in six months and 118 in a year --
slightly higher than the 109, 111 and 115 yen seen in last
month's survey.
 The poll also indicated the Swiss franc would depreciate a
tad but largely stay in a tight zone between 0.95 in a month's
time, 0.99 in six months and parity to the dollar in a year.
 ""Swings between risk aversion and risk appetite should
continue to lock USD-CHF in the 0.95/1.00 band in a quite
directionless trading for a prolonged arch of time,"" said
Roberto Mialich.
 Euro-Swiss franc cross rates were calculated at around 1.30
on the one-, six- and 12-month horizon, unchanged from last
month's survey.

919,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2011 09:48AM ET</span>","POLL-Swedish, Norwegian crown gains vs euro limited"," By Wojciech Moskwa and Walter Gibbs 
 OSLO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The buoyant Norwegian and Swedish
crowns are expected to appreciate more slowly against the euro
over the next 12 months and fall back against a resurgent
dollar, a Reuters poll of analysts shows.
 Both currencies will be driven higher by accelerating
economies and interest rate hikes at a time when the euro zone
remains mired in debt troubles.
 The Swedish crown has hit 10-year highs to the euro while
the Norwegian unit flirted with three-year highs against the
euro last month before trailing off a bit over the last three
weeks.
 ""The dynamic is much the same in both cases -- it's the
relative growth prospects that count,"" said Maren Romstad, a
currency analyst at DnB NOR Markets in Oslo.
 As fiscal tightening weighs on near-term prospects in the
euro zone the U.S. economy looks set for a pick-up in growth
that would give the dollar an additional lift, she said.
 ""It's important to remember that both the Norwegian and
Swedish crowns are already fairly strong, so many see limited
potential for further strengthening,"" Romstad said.
 According to the median forecast from a Reuters poll of
around 40 analysts, the Swedish crown is seen weakening to 8.85
against the euro in one month, then strengthening to 8.80 in
three months and to 8.75 in 12 months.
 That corresponds to a around a 1 percent rise in the next
year from Wednesday's 8.866 level.
 
 SWEDEN ""RELAXED"" ON CROWN
 Against the dollar, the Swedish crown is seen at 6.50 in one
month, 6.61 in three, 6.65 in six and 6.52 in 12 months' time --
or weakening by about 3.5 percent from the current level of
6.403.
 On Tuesday, Sweden's Finance Minister Anders Borg signalled
that the exchange rate was not a problem for Sweden's economy --
set to be Europe's top performer in terms of economic growth
rates again in 2011.
 ""We've had long periods with the crown stronger than now and
at the same time very high growth, for example in the nineties
when the crown strengthened a lot, and we at the same time had
very high growth numbers,"" Borg told Reuters. ""I have a very
relaxed attitude towards this,"" he said.
 The Norwegian currency is seen firming to 7.85 against the
euro in one month, 7.80 in three months, 7.73 in six months and
7.65 in 12 months compared to Wednesday's 7.90 level. To the
dollar it was seen weakening to 5.84 in six months before
returning roughly to Wednesday's level of 5.70 in 12 months.
 This view of limited further upside for the ""Nokkie"" would
surely be welcomed by Norway's central bank, which has said
further currency appreciation could affect inflation and the
bank's proposed interest rate path.
 ""We have noted that the crown has strengthened somewhat, and
to the extent that it strengthens further it will be a concern,
especially via low price impulses that affect rate-setting,""
Norges Bank chief Oeystein Olsen said last week.

 * Inflation, rising chance of BoE hike cited as reasons
 * Pound expected to continue steady appreciation vs euro
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Growing speculation the Bank of
England will fight inflation by raising interest rates sooner
rather than later has prompted a modest upgrade to sterling
forecasts for this year, a Reuters poll of strategists showed.
 Sterling hit a three-month peak against the dollar on
Wednesday above $1.62, which nobody predicted in last month's
poll. Median forecasts from the latest survey of 62 foreign
exchange analysts, taken this week, showed it weakening only
slightly in the next 12 months.
 While they bumped up their cable forecasts by around 2 cents
for each timeframe compared with the Jan. 5 poll, they now see
the pound falling back to $1.58 in one month, $1.57 in three
months and six months, before climbing to $1.60 in 12 months.
 Growing speculation that the BoE will bring forward a rate
hike to counter inflation, which hit an eight-month high of 3.7
percent in December, was chief among analysts' reasons for the
upgrade to forecasts.
 ""We still expect sterling to benefit from apparently
resuming risk appetite, the consequent weak dollar and
speculation that the BoE will be forced to hike rates due to
rising inflation pressures at home,"" said Roberto Mialich from
UniCredit, historically one of the poll's most accurate
forecasters.
 Minutes from the Bank's January rate-setting meeting showed
policymaker Martin Weale unexpectedly joined Andrew Sentance in
voting to raise rates in December -- and there were signs some
of the other seven members were thinking about it too.
 Predicting British interest rates has become a difficult
business. A poll of economists on Tuesday showed on balance they
thought the BoE would look beyond high inflation and keep rates
on hold at 0.5 percent until the fourth quarter to support the
economy.
 However, market expectations as measured by short sterling
interest rate futures  suggest a hike before the middle
of this year.
 
 TURNING POINT?
 Sterling should be less volatile this month, according to
calculations derived from the standard deviation of forecasts in
the poll. Compared with actual volatility of 8.7 percent in
January, the survey shows this declining slightly to 8.3 percent
in February.
 While the first batch of data for the UK's economic
performance in 2011 have so far looked largely positive, a turn
for the worse could trigger a profound shift in sterling
performance from here.
 ""We could well be poised for another major shift in
sentiment this time around depending on what the BoE
communicates and how data pan out over the coming three weeks,""
said Kenneth Broux at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets.
 Unexpectedly positive construction sector data on Wednesday
sent the pound to a three-month high, while economists expect
service sector PMI surveys to show further progress on Thursday.
 Against the euro, strategists largely retained their
forecasts for a modest sterling appreciation.
 The euro, which lost several percentage points against both
the pound and dollar last year, will decline further from its
present level of 85.4 pence to around 83 pence in 12 months'
time, the poll showed.

 * Euro to weaken versus dollar and pound in 2011
 * Debt crisis still weighs on minds
 * Euro seen more volatile against the dollar
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The euro will lose most of the
ground it has recently made against the dollar in the coming
year, despite expectations for a rate rise from the European
Central Bank, a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists
showed.
 The single currency lost almost 7 percent of its value
against the dollar last year, its worst performance since 2005,
but has regained almost 4 percent since the start of January,
trading on Wednesday at $1.38.
 But its path from here will not be smooth as the bloc's
members endure a slew of fiscal austerity measures that will
drag on growth, while the sovereign debt crisis that has already
forced Ireland and Greece to seek international bailouts weighs
on investors' minds.
 ""We look for the bullish trend to show signs of exhaustion
towards the end of February as markets look ahead,"" said Kenneth
Broux at Lloyds Banking Group.
 Median forecasts from the poll of more than 60 analysts,
taken this week, showed the euro at $1.35 in one month's time,
dropping to $1.31 in six and then dipping to $1.30 by this time
next year, largely in line with a poll taken last month.
 ""There is still risk of some retreat, as the EMU debt crisis
is not over and escalating geopolitical risks may also be a
source of volatility,"" said Roberto Mialich at UniCredit.
 European Union leaders are expected to reach a deal in late
March on reforming the region's rescue fund, conducting new,
tougher bank stress tests, tightening fiscal discipline and
improving economic policy coordination in the euro zone.
 And while the European Central Bank is seen raising rates
from a record low of 1.0 percent in the fourth quarter, it was a
close call between then and the first three months of 2012 in a
Reuters poll of 82 analysts published last week.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve is not expected to begin raising
its own low rates until early next year, despite economists
ramping up their growth expectations for the world's biggest
economy.
 The dollar is set to strengthen with the dollar index, which
measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, seen
ending this year at 80.2, up from its current level of 77.02.
 The weighted index had a volatile 2010, starting the year
around 77.64, peaking in June at about 88.71 and then finishing
off the year just over 80.

POUND PRESSURE
 Against sterling, the euro was seen weakening in the year
ahead as increasingly upbeat data suggests the Bank of England
may begin to raise interest rates sooner rather than later to
combat inflation running at nearly twice its target.
 The euro is seen buying 85.3 pence in a month, 83.3p in six
months and 82.9p in 12. In January's poll the respective
purchasing strength was 85.0p, 83.3p and 82.5p.
 Britain, whose economy surprised forecasters by contracting
in the fourth quarter, has been enduring its own austerity
cutbacks but figures on Tuesday showed manufacturing activity
grew in January at its fastest pace since records began in 1992,
while construction activity returned to growth last month.
 The expectations for a rate rise and the upbeat numbers sent
sterling to a three-month high of $1.621 on Wednesday.
 The euro was seen more volatile against the dollar over the
coming month. Analysts say the divergence of forecasts in
Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator of exchange
rate volatility in the following month.

 (Adds detail, comments from Estonian central bank, finance

 TALLINN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Estonia's GDP is expected to grow
3.6 percent in 2011 after bouncing back from recession with 2.4
percent growth in 2010, but downside risks have increased for
the new euro zone member, the IMF said on Wednesday.
 Estonian joined the euro zone on Jan. 1 after a 13.9 percent
economic contraction in 2009 cut inflation and helped it meet
the Maastricht criteria for euro zone membership.
 ""In its first year in the euro area, staff project that
growth will accelerate to about 3.5 percent,"" the International
Monetary Fund said in its annual report on the smallest of the
three Baltic economies.
 ""Still, unemployment is high and continued progress in job
creation will likely be hampered by skill mismatches.""
 It added that inflation is forecast to increase, reflecting
the full-year impact of global food and fuel price shocks,
although core inflation is expected to remain subdued.
 Inflation is forecast at 4.0 percent in 2011 after a 2.7
percent price rise in 2010.
 The country's Baltic neighbours Latvia and Lithuania are
also expected to show a return to growth in 2011, driven by
manufacturing sector exports, after having suffered the deepest
recessions in the European Union in 2009.
 Regional banking group Danske said in a report this week
that it expected Lithuania's GDP to grow by 3.6 percent in 2011,
Latvia's by 2.9 percent, and Estonia's by 3.9 percent.
 
 KEY POLICY CHALLENGE
 The IMF said the key policy challenge for Estonia is to
ensure it remains on a sustainable growth path, adding that
reaffirming ""authorities' commitment to prudent fiscal policy
... will further enhance credibility"".
 ""The authorities' medium-term goal of restoring a balanced
budget provides a natural benchmark to safeguard sustainability
and fiscal buffers,"" the multilateral lender said.
 Estonian central bank governor Andres Lipstok said in a
statement that ""the IMF rightly said that Estonia must continue
with a sustainable growth as the key policy challenge"".
 The IMF noted that Estonia had managed to keep its 2010
public sector budget deficit to about 1.25 percent of GDP, 1
percent less than in the 2010 budget. Governmental gross debt is
expected at 7 percent of GDP, the lowest in the EU with the
country holding a net external asset position in 2010.
 Estonia is due to hold national elections on March 6.
 Finance minister Jurgen Ligi said in a statement that he
welcomed concerns expressed by the IMF about possible spending
promises ahead of the vote.
 ""The most dangerous (promises) are long-term and
irreversible expenditure which would take us into chronic
indebtedness and into Europe's spreading borrowing
difficulties,"" Ligi said in a statement.
 The fund said Estonia's largely foreign-owned financial
sector still needs vigilance ""to ensure that liquidity
facilities operate effectively and bank capitalization and
provisioning remain appropriate given a weakened portfolio"".
 It also said Estonia would needed to adopt more technology
and quality production to help reduce a mismatch in skills in
the labour market that is pushing up wages in some sectors.

 MILAN/RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Talks between
Italy's Eni and Brazil's Petrobras over Eni's stake in
Portugal's Galp Energia have collapsed over price as the Italian
oil and gas group seeks a sale to cut debt, a source said on
Wednesday.
 Eni, one of Europe's most highly geared oil companies, has a
33.34 percent stake in Galp, valued at about 3.8 billion euros
($5.31 billion). It could use proceeds to reduce borrowings and
keep dividends flowing.
 A source close to the deal told Reuters that Petrobras had
pulled out of the bidding for the Galp stake.
 Earlier another source said talks with Petrobras were very
close to breaking down because Petrobras was offering too little
compared with with Eni's asking price.
 Eni declined to comment on the state of the talks except to
say that Petrobras was one of several parties interested in the
stake.
 State-controlled Petrobras has said it is considering buying
Eni's holding in Galp as it moves to expand its deepwater
operations and secure a refining beachhead in Europe.
 According to a report in Portuguese business daily Diario
Economico in January, Petrobras offered to buy Eni's stake for
3.5 billion euros.
 ""Eni has one of the highest debts among oil companies and it
would be positive for it to get the cash in. But Eni is looking
for a higher price and other buyers simply don't want to pay
it,"" a Milan broker said.
 Eni has said it is not interested in keeping minority stakes
in listed companies. It had said it may or may not sell the Galp
stake to Petrobras.
 Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni told reporters in January
the company was in no hurry to sell.
 Year-long speculation on the sale of Eni's Galp stake gained
fresh momentum after the Dec. 31 expiry of a lock-in pact among
key Galp shareholders.
 Under the agreement, Eni can only sell its stake as a single
block and a buyer of the stake might have to launch a bid for
the whole of Galp. Under Portuguese law a sale of a stake of
more than 33.3 percent triggers a compulsory bid.
 No one at Galp or Petrobras could immediately be reached for
comment.
 At 1522 GMT Eni's shares were up 0.22 percent at 18.05 euros
while the STOXX Europe 600 oil and gas sector index was up 0.35
percent. The stock had briefly turned negative after the news
that Petrobras' talks on Galp were collapsing.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2011 08:12AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-France to write balanced budget into constitution," * Change will fix clear objective of budgetary equilibrium 
 * Germany already has constitutional clause on deficit 
 * Talks on EU directive on budget requirements continue
 
 (adds political analyst quote, details of reform process)
 By Nicholas Vinocur and Emmanuel Jarry
 PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it would
reform its constitution to include a ""golden rule"" on balancing
the budget, following the example of Germany which already has
its own constitutional limit on deficits.
 Government spokesman Francois Baroin, who is also France's
budget minister, said the constitutional reform would be
presented to parliament in the coming weeks and would set a date
for France -- where generous welfare provisions have led to a
perennial deficit -- to achieve a fiscal balance.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy's government, which has said it
wants closer fiscal coordination with Germany, has been seeking
a mechanism to tackle France's large structural deficit, but
analysts said getting the constitutional change approved could
prove a challenge for his government ahead of 2012 elections.
 ""This is a reshaping of our constitution which will fix a
clear objective of budgetary equilibrium and will set the means
of achieving it,"" Baroin told journalists after a cabinet
meeting, without providing further specifics.
 EU paymaster Germany passed legislation in 2009 to set a
limit on the federal government's structural deficit, taking
into account the economic cycle.
 It is now pushing its euro zone partners to take similar
steps as part of a comprehensive anti-crisis package for the
bloc which is expected to be unveiled at an EU summit in late
March.
 
 TOUGH ROAD AHEAD
 In order to be enacted, the constitutional change will
either have to be approved by a referendum or by a three-fifths
majority in parliament -- a considerable challenge for Sarkozy's
centre-right government as it heads into an election year.
 ""I'm afraid there will be quite a few difficulties,"" said
Mariette Sineau, a political scientist at the CEVIPOF research
institute. ""Even within the UMP (ruling party) there are some
old Gaullists who will find fault with such budget orthodoxy.""
 The response on the left would be unanimous, she added.
""Among the Socialists, I think they will vote against en masse.""
The UMP has a majority in the National Assembly, but must appeal
to centrists in the Senate to rally votes.
 Baroin said conversations had been taking place in recent
weeks among European Union partners on an EU directive setting
the requirements for the budgetary frameworks of member states.
 The German ""debt brake"" rule caps new federal borrowing at
0.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from 2016, forcing
Berlin to reduce its structural deficit by roughly 10 billion
euros a year over the coming half-decade.
 Sarkozy set up a commission of experts a year ago to explore
introducing such a rule in France, but the commission stopped
short of advocating a German-style debt rule amid strong
opposition from parliamentarians, including in Sarkozy's UMP.
 Sarkozy did say in May, however, that he wanted French
governments to set out five-year plans to tackle the deficit as
part of a constitutional reform.
Baroin said the constitutional change would allow the
establishment of framework laws for longer term fiscal planning
and the setting of rules on how parliament will be consulted on
France's budget plans which are submitted to EU authorities
under the bloc's Stability and Growth Pact.
 France aims to cut its fiscal deficit to 6.0 percent of GDP
this year, from an estimated 7.7 percent of GDP in 2010, as part
of its efforts to reach an EU deficit ceiling of 3 percent of
GDP by 2013.
 Hitting this target by 2013 would imply France nearly
balancing its primary budget, excluding debt servicing costs.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The dollar clawed back some losses
while the euro slipped on Wednesday after an apparent lack of
consensus about a euro zone rescue fund highlighted ongoing
uncertainty about how to solve the region's debt problems.
 Comments from a German government source that Berlin opposed
the EFSF rescue fund buying bonds from euro zone countries
helped to pull the euro back from a near three-month high hit
against the dollar in earlier trade.
 A ratings downgrade of Irish government debt by ratings
agency Standard and Poor's also underlined fundamental weakness
in some euro zone countries, prompting short-term speculators to
sell the single currency.
 ""The euro is selling off further on this,"" said a trader in
London, referring to Germany's resistance to the bond buying.
 While this helped the dollar to recover from a 12-week low
hit against a currency basket in early trade, it remained on the
back foot after solid manufacturing data this week, low U.S.
yields and stimulative U.S. monetary policy pushed investors
towards riskier assets.
 ""The greenback is suffering on the back of the Fed's ultra
loose monetary policy and is being used as a funding currency as
the markets load up on risky assets,"" said Michael Hewson,
analyst at CMC Markets.
 The dollar index was flat on the day at 77.100, recovering
from a slide to 76.881, its lowest since early November. Its
fall had stalled above significant trendline support from the
all-time lows hit in March 2008 at 76.50.
 Data on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector grew
at its fastest pace last month since 2004.
 But unlike in 2004, when the Federal Reserve started pushing
up interest rates, the U.S. central bank is still committed to a
stimulative policy and a Fed official said another round of bond
purchases could be discussed at the Fed's next policy meeting in
mid-March if the recovery flags.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to a session low around
$1.3790, retreating after climbing to $1.3862, its highest since
early November.
 Next key resistance was the 76.4 percent retracement of the
euro's November to January fall around $1.3950, coinciding with
the 200-week moving average at $1.3956.
 Overall, the dollar suffered broadly, hitting a three-month
low versus sterling on upbeat UK data and hawkish central bank
comments, and hovered near a record low versus the Swiss franc.
 Against the yen, it was at 81.50 yen, not far from around
81.30 yen hit in earlier trade, roughly matching a one-month low
hit the previous day.
 Markets will focus on U.S. ADP employment data for January
at 1315 GMT for a steer on the more significant U.S. non-farm
payroll report on Friday.
 
 EURO BUOYED
 Euro losses were limited as it continued to be supported on
rising expectations that the European Central Bank will be well
ahead of its U.S. counterpart in raising rates.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to give more
warnings on inflation at a news conference on Thursday, after
euro zone inflation data this week was higher than forecast.
 Trichet's news conference will be followed by Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech on the same day, which
could highlight the U.S. central bank's relative dovishness
compared with the ECB.
 Despite the euro's near year rally on rate speculation, some
analysts say it will require new impetus to extend its rally.
 ING analysts argue the two-year euro swap rate -- the rate
at which corporates hedge against interest rate risk -- has
limited room to rise after pushing above 2 percent, 100 basis
points over the policy rate, which they say is ""extreme"".
 ""EUR/USD may have come about as far as it can on the ECB
story alone, and will need an alternative catalyst to punch it
through resistance in the $1.3900/1.4000 area,"" analyst Chris
Turner said in a note.

 * Rise in producer prices points to inflationary pressures
 
 (Adds economists' comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices rose
more than expected in December, data showed on Wednesday,
boosted mainly by a jump in energy costs, pointing to rising
inflationary pressures early in the pipeline.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices
at factory gates in the 16 countries using the euro in December
rose 0.8 percent month-on-month for a 5.3 percent year-on-year
rise. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a monthly rise
of 0.7 percent and annual gain of 5.2 percent.
 The rise in producer prices, which translate into consumer
price increases unless absorbed by intermediaries and retailers,
was driven mainly by a 2.2 percent monthly increase and an 11.3
percent annual jump in the costs of energy.
 ""It is a clear leading indicator of rising inflationary
pressures, adding to the ECB's headache,"" said Carsten Brzeski,
economist at ING bank.
 ""It also shows the ECB's move to a more hawkish tone was
fully justified,"" he added.
 The ECB, which meets on interest rates on Thursday, expects
inflation to peak in March and then to ease again. ECB Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny has said he did not expect any rate
rises in the first half of the year.
 Excluding the volatile prices of energy and construction,
producer prices rose only 0.3 percent month-on-month and 3.3
percent year-on-year in the euro zone.
 Consumer inflation jumped to 2.4 percent in January, an
early estimate showed on Monday -- the highest rate since
October 2008 and above the European Central Bank's target of
below, but close to 2 percent.
 There was no clear consensus among economists in the latest
Reuters poll on when the European Central Bank would first raise
rates, as the bank ponders controlling inflation or supporting
struggling periphery members.
 ""We expect ECB policymakers to continue to look through the
current spike-up in consumer price inflation and maintain the
view that it will fall back to its target level later this year
given the limiting inflationary impact of still significant
output gaps in most countries and high unemployment,"" said
Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 ""The ECB is also very aware that fiscal tightening will
increasingly weigh down on economic activity across the region
in 2011 and that recurrent sovereign debt tensions, high
unemployment and the ongoing need for balance sheet adjustments
among many consumers, companies and banks are also a threat to
growth,"" Archer said.
 ""Furthermore the ECB is also very aware that higher interest
rates are the last thing that Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain
and Italy need,"" he said.
 While none of the 82 economists Reuters polled expect the
ECB to raise rates from their record low of 1.0 percent when it
meets on Thursday, the median between the first hike being in the
final three months of this year or early next is a close call.
 ""The fourth quarter now looks like the best bet,"" said ING's
Brzeski.

3.6 percent in 2011 after bouncing back with 2.4 percent growth
in 2010, but downside risks have increased for the new euro zone
member, the IMF said on Wednesday.
 Estonian joined the euro zone from Jan 1 after a 13.9
percent recession brought down inflation, helping it to meet the
Maastricht criteria for euro zone membership.
 ""In its first year in the euro area, staff project that
growth will accelerate to about 3 1/2 percent. Still,
unemployment is high and continued progress in job creation will
likely be hampered by skill mismatches,"" the IMF said in it
annual Article IV on the smallest of the three Baltic economies.
 It added that inflation is forecast to increase reflecting
the full-year impact of global food and fuel price shocks,
although core inflation is expected to remain subdued.
 The fund said inflation is forecast at 4.0 percent in 2011
after a 2.7 percent price rise in 2010.
 The key policy challenge for the country is to ensure that
Estonia remains on a sustainable growth path and the IMF
suggests that sticking and reaffirming ""authorities' commitment
to prudent fiscal policy ... will further enhance credibility"".
 ""The authorities' medium-term goal of restoring a balanced
budget provides a natural benchmark to safeguard sustainability
and fiscal buffers,"" it added.
 The IMF said the country's almost completely foreign-owned
financial sector still needs vigilance ""to ensure that liquidity
facilities operate effectively and bank capitalization and
provisioning remain appropriate given a weakened portfolio.
 The country is also seen addressing its mismatch in skills
and subsequent upward wage pressure in some sectors by boosting
competitiveness and productivity and this will require climbing
up the technology and quality ladder, the fund said.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The dollar-index hit 12-week lows
on Wednesday, heading towards key support as solid manufacturing
data this week, low U.S. yields and stimulative U.S. monetary
policy pushed investors towards riskier assets.
 Strong manufacturing numbers from the United States and
other countries fuelled optimism on global economic growth, with
expectations of loose U.S. monetary policy further encouraging
risk-taking as concerns over euro zone peripheral debt seemed to
be contained for now.
 ""The dollar is weak due to the huge U.S. deficit, no yield
and a very dovish central bank,"" said Ray Farris, currency
strategist at Credit Suisse.
 ""The market is now embracing the idea that the euro area
political elite are going to do enough to prevent real financing
stress in the periphery which would enable the ECB (European
Central Bank) to hike rates,"" he added.
 The dollar index dipped to 76.881, its lowest since early
November. It stalled ahead significant trendline support from
the all-time lows hit in March 2008 at 76.50 and was last at
76.951, down 0.1 percent on the day.
 Data on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector grew
at its fastest pace last month since 2004.
 But unlike in 2004, when the Federal Reserve started pushing
up interest rates, the U.S. central bank is still committed to a

today's figures to show 145,000 jobs were created in January
versus 297,000 in December.
 
 EURO BUOYED
 Better risk sentiment has fed into more buying of the euro,
which has been hurt by concerns over some euro zone countries'
debt financing. Spanish and other peripheral debt has rallied
relative to German Bunds this week as investors detect signs
that new measures will be agreed to tackle the year-old
sovereign debt crisis.
 The euro was close to flat at $1.3830 after climbing to
$1.3862, its highest since early November. Next key resistance
was the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's November to
January fall around $1.3950, coinciding with the 200-week moving
average at $1.3956.
 The common currency continued to benefit from rising
expectations that the European Central Bank will be well ahead

 * Licensing system for fat makers next anti-dioxin step
 HAMBURG, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The German cabinet on Wednesday
approved the first in a series of measures aimed at raising
standards in the animal feed industry following the discovery of
the toxic chemical dioxin in feed, which led to a health alert.
 The cabinet approved a new rule that puts an extra
responsibility on private laboratories to report suspect tests
of food or animal feed to the authorities, the Agriculture
Ministry said.
 Animal feed and food firms must themselves also notify
authorities of any suspect dioxin or finds of other dangerous
substances in their products. This will enable creation of an
early-warning system of contamination, the ministry said.
 German and European Union authorities are dealing with an
alert, which began on Jan. 3 when German officials said feed
tainted with dioxin had been fed to hens and pigs, contaminating
eggs, poultry meat and pork at affected farms. Sales of eggs,
chicken and pork dropped sharply.
 Prosecutors in Germany are investigating the cause of the
contamination and specifically whether industrial fats and feeds
company Harles and Jentzsch distributed fatty acids meant for
industrial paper production to animal feed processors.
 Germany's government on Jan. 19 announced a package of
measures to raise animal feed production standards, which are
now being put into action at maximum speed, German Farm Minister
Ilse Aigner said on Wednesday.
 The next stage will be the announcement of a licensing
system for makers of oils and fats for animal feed use, she
said.
 New regulations are also being prepared to compel the
separation of production of fats and oils for industrial uses
from uses in animal feed.
 Russia last week banned poultry meat imports from Germany
because of the dioxin alert.

 * But passenger demand growth slows to 4.9 percent
(Recasts with details, background, quote, link)
 GENEVA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Air freight grew by over one fifth
in 2010, in a sign of global economic recovery, but severe
weather in Europe and North America dented passenger demand at
the end of the year, the airline body IATA said on Wednesday.
 Both passenger and freight demand have now exceeded
pre-recession levels but freight volumes have dropped 5 percent
since the peak of the post-recession restocking boom in early
2010, the International Air Transport Association said.
 IATA Director-General Giovanni Bisignani said the world was
moving again after an unprecedented decline in aviation demand
in 2009. Airlines ended the year ahead of 2008 volumes but with
a profit margin of only 2.7 percent.
 ""The challenge is to turn the demand for mobility into
sustainable profits,"" he said in a statement.
 Demand for air cargo -- an important indicator of world
trade flows -- was 6.7 percent higher in December than a year
earlier after rising 5.4 percent in November, to show a 20.6
percent rise for the full year, IATA's monthly traffic data
showed.
 The World Trade Organization has projected that global trade
rebounded by a record 13.5 percent in 2010. IATA estimates that
some 30 percent of world trade by value -- more expensive goods
than bulk cargos -- are moved by air.
 With freight demand growth oscillating between 35.2 percent
in May and 5.8 percent in November, the industry is heading
towards a more normal growth pattern in line with historical
growth rates of 5-6 percent.
 Severe weather in North America and Europe dented passenger
demand in December, with growth slowing to 4.9 percent from 8.2
percent in November. For the whole of 2010 passenger demand also
rose by 8.2 percent.
 IATA, whose 230 members include Lufthansa and Singapore
Airlines, has forecast that airlines will make a cumulative
profit in 2010 of $15.1 billion, but slowing demand will see
this fall to $9.1 billion this year.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - World stocks punched fresh
29-month highs on Wednesday, lifted by strong data pointing to
sustained global economic recovery, continuing positive
corporate earnings and easing concerns about Egypt.
 Wall Street looked set to open flat to slightly higher.
 Oil prices fell back from 28-month highs, but Brent crude
was still more than $101 a barrel on worries that unrest in
Egypt could trigger changes to the status quo elsewhere in the
Middle East and North Africa.
 The dollar fell to three-month lows against a basket of
major currencies before recovering slightly.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index, one of the broadest
gauges of global equities, was up 0.4 percent after earlier
hitting levels last seen in August 2008.
 Its developed market counterpart gained 0.3 percent, close
to a high last seen in early September 2008.
 Emerging markets were up 0.6 percent on the day, but remain
down more than 1 percent for the year, reflecting a recent shift
by investors from emerging to developed markets.
 Stock investors were cheered on Tuesday by strong factory
data worldwide, which pushed U.S. benchmark stock indexes to
their highest closing levels since June 2008.
Strong earnings from delivery firm UPS Inc and drugmaker
Pfizer in the United States on Tuesday, and Imperial Tobacco on
Wednesday added to the mood.
 ""The world economy appears to be improving a little faster
than expected, valuations are ok and companies are publishing
quite good results,"" Geert Ruysschaert, strategist at BNP
Paribas Fortis Private Banking, said. ""So investors can take
advantage of that.""
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.1 percent, off
its highs but at a 3.5 percent year-to-date gain. Earlier,
Japan's benchmark Nikkei ended up 1.8 percent for its biggest
daily gain since Dec. 2.
 Concerns about the political crisis in Egypt, meanwhile,
were easing on financial markets after President Hosni Mubarak
said he will step down at the end of his term in September,
although protestors continue to demand an immediate end to his
30-year rule.
 Foreign investors have begun to show renewed interest in
Egyptian bonds and stocks and the cost of insuring Egytian debt
against default fell.

 The euro climbed to $1.3861, its highest since early
November, but later dropped back to $1.3798.
 In a further sign that the euro zone crisis is at least
being put on a back-burner by investors, the premium demanded to
hold Spanish and Italian government bonds rather than German
debt fell.
 Commodity prices continued to rise on improving global
growth prospects with copper hitting a fresh record high at
close to $10,000 a tonne.
 Gold fell as rising equities, hopes for continued global
recovery and easing concern about Egypt dampened its safe haven
appeal. Spot gold fell more than $7 to around $1,333 an ounce,
well below its December record high of around $1,430.

 * US embassy advises caution in dealings
 * Fraudsters enjoy ""Robin Hood"" image locally
 
 By Simon Akam
 FREETOWN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Spurred on by record prices for
the precious metal, fraudsters in Sierra Leone have latched on
to a cheap gold hustle targeting gullible speculators from the
United States and Europe.
 At home, the tricksters enjoy notoriety with nicknames such
as ""Large"" and ""Capitalist"" and are even admired as latter-day
Robin Hoods by some in the impoverished West African country.
 But authorities fear the scam -- which relies on the false
belief that gold can be bought there at a fraction of world
prices -- is ruining efforts to rebrand Sierra Leone as a
serious investment venue a decade after civil war.
 ""They are causing us a lot of problems in government,"" said
attorney-general Frank Kargbo.
 ""One little incident can discourage investors, particularly
when it gets out in countries we'd hope we'd attract investors
from,"" he complained.
 The U.S. embassy in Freetown says six U.S. nationals have
lost up to $350,000 each in scams in the past six months.
European embassies have reported similar cases without giving
details of the extent of the losses.
 Sierra Leone's gold exports stood at 270,234 grams in 2010,
more than double the 2008 figure. But that does not show the
true output because much of the country's gold is smuggled over
porous borders, notably to Guinea.
 Gold has enjoyed a meteoric rise in value over much of the
past decade as nervous investors seek a safe haven. Although it
has eased slightly in recent weeks, gold  hit an all-time
high of $1,430.95 an ounce on Dec 7 of last year. 
 That has created a window of opportunity for tricksters who
offer expatriate investors a kilo at $18,000-20,000, well under
half the world market price.
 
 ""COLONIALISM ON ITS HEAD""
 The scam itself is a riff on the time-honoured advance fee
fraud, known in West Africa as '419' after the section of the
Nigerian penal code that prohibits it. 
 Punters are shown a small quantity of real gold, with the
promise of much more at a low price. They are subsequently asked
to pay large sums upfront for taxes, insurance and licensing.
 Any metal they receive, though, is worthless: often brass or
copper shavings.
 In a twist on the original fraud, Sierra Leonean ""419ers""
sometimes try to extort more money from the victim by accusing
them of attempting to take gold out of the country illegally.
 ""I don't understand how a fully grown man can be convinced
into parting with $600,000 for gold that is not in their
possession,"" said Stribey Edward Logan of Sierra Leone's
Transnational Organised Crime Unit.
 Douglas Sun at the U.S. embassy simply urges expatriates ""to
think twice about paying huge amounts of money up front"".
 ""I would warn Americans to be very wary of doing deals with
people they meet on the streets, in the hotel lobby, in bars and
restaurants,"" he added.
 The improbability of finding a local bargain is underlined
by Olufemi Boyle-Hebron, a gold and diamond dealer in Freetown
who runs his own refinery.
 His agents buy from artisanal miners in the field at prices
up to $37,500 per kilo. Once export dues and other fees are paid
he sells for $44,000 at a profit of just $3,000 per kilo.
 ""There's no cheap gold in Sierra Leone ... I work in
volume,"" he explained.
 While Sierra Leonean officials emphasise their determination
to crack down on gold 419, some privately acknowledge evidence
of collusion within the ranks of the police and mines sector,
and prosecuting alleged scammers has often proven difficult.
 While many Africans deplore their behaviour, there is a
certain admiration for scammers among some in a country which
hosts a growing number of multinationals eyeing its resource
wealth, but where annual income per head is barely $800.
 ""There's this almost Robin Hood-like celebration of it,""
said Daniel Smith, an anthropologist at Brown University in the
United States who has studied 419 scams in Nigeria.
 ""It's like turning colonialism on its head.""

 * Sentance: Need to look through GDP fluctuations

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Fiona Shaikh and Avril Ormsby
 LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Bank of England may be forced
to raise interest rates if commodity prices continue to climb
and inflation becomes embedded, Deputy Governor Charles Bean
said, in a sign the BoE is inching closer to tightening policy.
 Bean's comments to a regional newspaper came at the same
time as long-standing hawk Andrew Sentance reiterated his call
for higher rates and warned that the BoE risked losing its
inflation-fighting credibility if it did not act soon.
 Both policymakers indicated they were not overly concerned
by the 0.5 percent economic contraction at the end of last year,
suggesting that may not deter them from tightening policy.
 Surveys this week showing manufacturing growth picked up and
construction rebounded from a weather-related fall in December,
imply the economy made a solid start to 2011. [ID:nLDE7110RB]
 Interest rate futures fell sharply in the wake of the latest
figures and the pound climbed, as investors bet the BoE would
raise rates sooner rather than later.
 Bean said the Bank still expected inflation to fall back
towards its 2 percent target, providing there were no further
price shocks, but if commodity prices remained high in the
medium term, policymakers would have to act.
 ""We may well have to respond to that by keeping
domestically-generated inflation lower,"" Bean was quoted as
saying in the Western Mail newspaper.
 He said a rate rise could be made in the context of strong
growth.
 ""On the other hand if it is in response to a spike in oil
prices that we think is likely to persist and inflation is
becoming embedded that is not a nice reason to raise interest
rates, but we would have to do it.
 ""That certainly could be one driver of a change in interest
rates if we thought it materially affected the medium-term
outlook.""
 Bean's comments highlight the growing concern among
policymakers that the external factors driving up prices, which
they have so far shrugged off as being temporary, could become a
permanent fixture and start to fuel a wage-price spiral.
 A second member of the nine-man Monetary Policy Committee,
Martin Weale, joined Sentance in voting for a quarter-point hike
in January, and for other members the decision was a ""finely
balanced"" one, minutes of that meeting showed.
 Nonetheless, analysts said policymakers were unlikely to
make the leap to higher rates at their meeting next week,
although there is a strong possibility of a move by May.
 ""I think February is probably off the cards: they're going
to want to see clear evidence of an improvement in GDP,"" said
George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank.
 ""These are very uncertain times: the MPC will want to be
sure that when they do start tightening policy, it is the right
time to do it and it won't threaten the recovery.""
 
 SOFT ON CPI?
 With inflation at almost double its 2 percent target and
likely to rise even further, the BoE must act soon to safeguard
its inflation-fighting credibility, Sentance said.
 ""The longer we delay [monetary tightening] the more there is
a risk that interest rate rises when they come will have to be
larger, and then there will be a bigger risk of a shock to
confidence,"" Sentance told the CityAM newspaper.
 ""We need to be prepared to look through fluctuations in GDP
growth when we're recovering from recession: growth figures are
never linear and smooth in recoveries."" 
 Policymakers will have their updated inflation and growth
forecasts when they make their decision next week, and these are
likely to show inflation picking up sharply in the coming months
to almost 5 percent -- 3 percentage points above target.
 Analysts say a strong reading on tomorrow's services PMI
survey could embolden those policymakers who were wavering to
vote for an increase before the next forecasting round in May.
 ""Even if they don't go in February, I am not sure we're
going to have until May. The Inflation Report could tee us up
for a March or April hike,"" said Ross Walker at RBS.
 ""If we get an outsize bounce in the services PMI on
Thursday, it's toss a coin time -- it's really going to be
close.""
 The government's programme of tax hikes and spending cuts
add a further complication to the BoE's decision-making process.
 But any let-up in the pace of cuts may give the BoE the
green light to raise rates, the Institute for Fiscal Studies
said on Wednesday. [ID:nLDE7110WM]
 ""Any fiscal loosening aimed at helping the economy could be
ineffective if it prompts an offsetting monetary tightening,""
the think-tank said.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2011 01:44AM ET</span>",Statisticians hunt better ways to count trade figures," * Count the added value not the bilateral flows
 * Trade deficits and surpluses seen changing
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - In an age of global supply chains,
trade figures give an increasingly misleading picture of what is
going on -- and trade statisticians are out to change that.
Trade figures have become politically explosive -- witness
the sensitivity of the U.S. deficit with China for relations
between the two powers.
 Trade is still measured in the traditional way -- looking at
bilateral flows between one country and all the others. 
 Nowadays many goods are made up of components sourced from
many different countries, based on designs and research from
others, and assembled in one before being sold. 
 Measuring where value is added at each stage gives a more
precise picture of who is buying what from whom, and for how
much.
""Economic reality is changing so fast that there is a need
to change our statistics,"" said Hubert Escaith, chief
statistician at the WTO.
 The World Trade Organization is keenly interested in all
this, and is hosting a meeting of experts this week.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy cites a recent study by the
Asian Development Bank Institute of the trade flows involved in
Apple's iPhone, assembled in China with components from many
countries then exported to the United States and elsewhere.
 Using traditional country of origin methods, the iPhone
contributed $1.9 billion to the U.S. trade deficit with China.
 But if China's iPhone exports to the United States were
measured in value added -- the value added by China to the
components -- those exports would come to only $73.5 million, he
wrote in the Financial Times on Jan. 24.
 
 FROM BLACK-AND-WHITE TO COLOUR
 Deputy Director-General Alejandro Jara compares the new
approach to moving from black-and-white television to colour.
 This value-added approach will tend to reduce bilateral
deficits and surpluses, and could even reverse the plus or minus
signs on small amounts, although a country's overall balance
with the rest of the world will be little affected.
 For instance the United States would have a smaller deficit
with China, but a bigger one with Malaysia and other countries.
 ""The deficit between the United States and China will not be
what it is, but is going to be less, definitely less,"" Jara
said. ""How much less? I don't know.""
 Looking at figures in this way has huge implications for
policymakers keen to defend or create jobs.
 ""You may be focusing on the wrong cause of your lack of
competitiveness when you focus on one country,"" Escaith said.
 One obvious area for re-examination is bilateral exchange
rates. Many politicians in the United States urge pressure on
China to appreciate the yuan and thus reduce the U.S. deficit.
That may be the wrong -- or not the only -- target.
 Or it may turn out that offshoring -- having things made
abroad cheaply -- underpins more valuable research and design
jobs at home.
 At this week's conference the WTO has invited 150
statisticians from developed and developing countries to Geneva
from Feb. 2 to 4. 
 The meeting will lay out the research challenges for the
coming years and look at how to help developing countries
finance the new way of counting.
 Research is likely to show that some countries, including
China and states in Southeast Asia and the European Union, are
heavily integrated into international supply chains.
 Other areas like Latin America -- with the exception of
Mexico, some sectors in Brazil and Costa Rica -- appear not to
be, raising the question: Why?
 The new approach also looks at what combination of goods and
services goes into assembling a product, and shows that services
make up a much bigger share of trade than thought.
 To get a bunch of grapes from Chile to an American
supermarket requires more than a farmer to grow it, Jara said.
Transport, packaging, quality control, legal services,
accountants, telecoms and agronomists all play a role.

 By Ron Popeski	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks jumped on
Wednesday and the dollar sank as a surge in U.S. manufacturing
and strong company earnings convinced investors to pile back
into riskier assets despite turmoil in Egypt.	
 Commodities prices remained firm, bolstering shares of
resources firms, on signs that the global economy is gathering
strength. Copper surged to record peaks near $10,000 a tonne,
while Brent crude remained above $101 a barrel -- its highest
since October 2008.	
 After a million people took to the streets in Egypt on
Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he would
surrender power in September, but that was not enough for many
protesters who demanded an immediate end to his 30-year rule.

 Much now appears to depend on whether the army can ensure a
peaceful leadership transition.	
 ""The easing of the crisis in Egypt helped investors to
concentrate on positive economic data from the U.S., boosting
their appetite for equities,"" said Hideyuki Ishiguro of Ikasan
Securities.	
 Japan's Nikkei index rose 1.8 percent -- its biggest
daily advance in around two months -- as the latest in a string
of bullish U.S. economic data pushed Wall Street to its highest
levels in 2-1/2 years. 
 The MSCI index of Asian shares outside of Japan
advanced 1 percent, though activity was thin
ahead of the long Lunar New Year holidays in much of Asia.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 1.8 percent in a
shortened session while Australia's main benchmark
gained 0.9 percent despite the approach of Cyclone Yasi, said by
forecasters to be the strongest ever to strike the country.

 Global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto
both rose more than 2 percent as metals prices
continued to rally.	
 The dollar was stuck near its lowest level in three months
against the euro as robust economic data eased concerns over
Egypt and coaxed investors out of safe-haven assets. The euro
rose to $1.3853 on trading platform EBS, a touch higher
than late U.S. levels.	
 ""When investors' risk appetite grows, the dollar becomes a
funding currency,"" said Junya Tanase, a strategist at J.P.
Morgan Chase bank.	
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in
nearly seven years, data showed on Tuesday, but factories' costs
are also rising and are being passed on to consumers, raising
fears of both a spike in inflation and a slowdown in sales as
buyers baulk at higher prices. 
 On Wall Street, investors capitalised on last week's
pullback, sending the Dow to close over the psychologically
important level of 12,000 for the first time since June 2008 and
the S&P 500 to close above 1,300 for the first time since August
2008. 
 Markets considered the crisis in Egypt contained for now,
with little risk of spreading elsewhere through the oil-rich
region after Mubarak said he would surrender power soon --
although opposition leaders dismissed his speech, protesters
stayed put and and U.S. President Barack Obama called for faster
change.	
 Commodity prices remained strong, with London copper futures
rallying to a record high of $9,980 -- bolstered by
positive manufacturing data from China and the United States and
speculative interest in physical commodities.	
 North Sea Brent crude oil futures eased 0.3 percent
to $101.44 as traders continued to watch if the unrest in Egypt
would curb its oil shipments, while U.S. crude futures
slipped closer to $90.

 By Chang-Ran Kim, Asia autos correspondent
 TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co is looking to make
small investments in North America to build more of its popular
CR-V crossovers there, reducing exports from Japan to cushion the
blow from a strong yen, an executive said.
 ""Our profit structure has improved mainly thanks to robust
overseas operations, and the toughest area remains exports from
Japan,"" Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Hojo told a small group of
reporters at Honda's headquarters on Wednesday.
 ""With a little investment, we would be able to increase
production of the CR-V in the United States, so that's the most
probable course of action (to reduce yen exposure),"" he said.
 Japanese automakers are reeling from a strong yen, now
trading at around 81-82 to the dollar, losing money on
lower-margin models that are exported from domestic factories.
 Honda already has the least currency exposure among Japan's
top automakers given its relatively low export ratio of 30
percent. Last year, Toyota Motor Corp shipped 53 percent of its
Japan-made vehicles, and Nissan Motor Co exported 59 percent.
 Honda, Japan's third-biggest automaker, built about 72,000
CR-Vs in Japan last year, exporting about 35,000 of them to the
United States. Honda also builds the model in Mexico and East
Liberty, Ohio.
 Hojo said Honda was looking at various options for raising
production of the CR-V in the United States, where two of its
four assembly plants, including the East Liberty factory, are
operating at full capacity while the adjacent Marysville plant is
working at around 80 percent.
 Honda also has a factory in Indiana working at half of its
full capacity and a plant in Canada at around 88 percent.
 With gasoline prices still relatively stable, more U.S.
consumers are driving away with light trucks instead of passenger
cars, and Hojo said Honda was boosting daily production at one of
its two lines at its Alabama plant by 50 units to 650 units from
this month to meet demand for the Odyssey minivan and Pilot SUV.
 COST, PRICING STRUCTURE IMPROVING
 Rivals are also taking similar steps to reduce exports from
Japan. Nissan said last month it would shift production of its
Rogue crossover from Japan to the United States at its next
remodelling in 2013.
 Hojo said Honda, like other Japanese automakers, would look
to use more components from low-cost countries such as China and
India to take advantage of the strong yen, also making those
adjustments when vehicles are renewed.
 Honda is due to revamp its high-volume Civic this spring, and
Hojo said he expected new low-cost parts to account for at least
10 percent of the car, from virtually none now.
 Honda has already raised that ratio on the low-margin Fit
subcompact to 17 percent, and is aiming to boost that to about 30
percent, Hojo said.
 Honda on Monday delivered better-than-expected third-quarter
earnings and lifted its annual profit forecasts beyond the market
consensus, largely due to the popularity of light trucks in North
America.
 Honda this week forecast an operating profit of 620 billion
yen ($7.62 billion) for the business year ending on March 31, for
an operating margin of 7.0 percent -- at the top end of the
industry -- despite an 8-yen fall in the dollar.
 Executive Vice President Koichi Kondo said this week Honda
had achieved an earnings structure under which it could make a
profit of 100 billion yen per quarter at a dollar rate of 85 yen
and car sales of 900,000 units. A year ago, it had strived to
achieve that level of profitability at 90 yen to the dollar.
 Hojo attributed the stronger earnings structure to the
company's ability to raise its product prices -- by around 1-2
percent a year in the United States -- and a better cost
structure partly helped by greater economies of scale.
 Honda's shares have jumped 27 percent in the past three
months, outperforming a gain of about 20 percent for both Toyota
and Nissan.
 In mid-afternoon trade on Wednesday, Honda was up 2.1 percent
at 3,620 yen, mirroring a rise in the broader Tokyo market.

 * Euro hits 12-week peak as ECB rate hike hopes help
 * Yen near 4-week high, signs hint at break from range
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The dollar marked its lowest level
in nearly three months on Wednesday as a string of robust
economic data and easing concerns over Egypt took the steam out
of safe-haven buying in the currency.
 Strong manufacturing numbers from the United States and other
countries fuelled optimism on global economic growth, with
expectations of loose U.S. monetary policy further encouraging
risk-taking.
 ""When investors' risk appetite grows, the dollar becomes a
funding currency,"" said Junya Tanase, a strategist at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank.
 ""If the unrest in Egypt does not worsen and global markets
remain stable, the dollar is likely to keep falling moderately,""
he added.
 The dollar index dipped to 76.931, its lowest since early
November, grappling with a 76.4 percent retracement of its
November rally around 77.00.
 Data on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector last
month grew at its fastest pace since 2004.
 But unlike in 2004, when the Federal Reserve started pushing
up interest rates, the U.S. central bank is still committed to
stimulative policy and a Fed official said another round of bond
purchases could be discussed at the Fed's next policy meeting in
mid-March if the recovery flags.
 The combination of strong growth prospects and easy policy
outlook is encouraging investors to wade into risky trades.
 That meant more buying of the euro, which has been marred by
concerns over some euro zone countries' debt financing, as well
as of growth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The euro climbed as high as $1.3853, its highest since early
November, as the common currency continued to benefit from rising
expectations that the European Central Bank will go well ahead of
its U.S. counterpart in raising rates.
 ""I don't see any reason to think that the current
dollar-selling trend will change in the near term. The euro will
probably test $1.40,"" a trader at a Japanese bank said.
 EGYPT CONCERNS EASE
 Surprisingly strong euro zone manufacturing data, which some
market players took as a sign that growth in Germany was
trickling down to others in the bloc, also bolstered the
currency.
 The Australian dollar maintained Tuesday's 1.5 percent gain
to trade at $1.0110, with stronger commodity prices seen paving
the way for the currency to test resistance at $1.0152 and
$1.0183.
 Concerns in the financial markets that the Egyptian political
crisis could spread to other countries in the region abated, at
least for now.
 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Tuesday that he
would step down in a few months once a successor is elected,
although it remains to be seen if that satisfies many protesters
who want him out immediately.
 ""It's not clear whether the chaos in Egypt is coming to an
end. But at least it's not affecting financial markets,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank.
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent on the day to 81.48 yen but
stayed near a four-week low of 81.31 yen hit on Tuesday.
 Option-related bids near 81.30 yen are supporting the U.S.
currency. In addition, a trendline connecting a Nov. 1 trough of
80.21 and a Jan. 3 low of 80.94 comes in around 81.25-30.
 A clear break of this level may open the way for a test of
the Nov. 1 low, which sits just above a record low of 79.75
marked in 1995.
 The dollar's fall came even as U.S. bond yields rose a tad on
Tuesday, which tends to help the dollar against the low-yielding
yen, leading some traders to expect more weakness in the dollar
against the yen in the near term.
 ""Broad selling pressure in the dollar from rising global
share prices appears to be overwhelming the impact of rising bond
yields,"" said J.P. Morgan's Tanase.
 The greenback was also within striking distance of a record
low against the Swiss franc, trading at 0.9360 franc, compared
with its record low of 0.9301 hit late last year.

since October 2008.	
 After a million people took to the streets in Egypt on
Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he would
surrender power in September, but that was not enough for many
protesters who demanded an immediate end to his 30-year rule.

 ""The easing of the crisis in Egypt helped investors to
concentrate on positive economic data from the U.S., boosting
their appetite for equities,"" said Hideyuki Ishiguro of Ikasan
Securities.	
 Japan's Nikkei index rose 1.9 percent -- its biggest
daily advance in two and half months -- as the latest in a
string of bullish U.S. economic data pushed Wall Street to its
highest levels in 2-1/2 years. 
 The MSCI index of Asian shares outside of Japan
climbed 0.9 percent, though activity was thin
ahead of the long Lunar New year holidays in much of Asia.	
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.6 percent in a
shortened session while Australia's main benchmark
gained 0.8 percent despite the approach of Cyclone Yasi, said by
forecasters to be the strongest ever to strike the country.	
 The dollar was stuck near its lowest level in three months
against the euro as robust economic data eased concerns over
Egypt and coaxed investors out of safe-haven assets. The euro
rose to $1.3853 on trading platform EBS, a touch higher
than late U.S. levels.	
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in
nearly seven years, data showed overnight, but factories' costs
are also rising and are being passed on to consumers, raising
fears of both a spike in inflation and a slowdown in sales as
buyers baulk at higher prices. 
 On Wall Street, investors capitalised on last week's
pullback, sending the Dow to close over the psychologically
important level of 12,000 for the first time since June 2008 and
the S&P 500 to close above 1,300 for the first time since August
2008. 
 Markets considered the crisis in Egypt contained, with
little risk of spreading elsewhere through the region for now
after Mubarak said he would surrender power soon -- although
this was rejected by opposition leaders and U.S. President
Barack Obama called for more rapid change.	
 Commodity prices remained strong, with London copper futures
rallying to a record high just shy of $10,000 --
bolstered by positive data from China and the United States.	
 North Sea Brent crude oil futures were little
changed at just under $102 as unrest in Egypt continued to
support energy prices. U.S. crude futures edged closer to
$91.

 TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The dollar was stuck near its lowest
level in nearly three months on Wednesday as a string of robust
economic data and easing concerns over Egypt took the steam out
of safe-haven buying in the currency.
 The dollar, which attracted safe-haven bids late last week as
protests in Egypt intensified, fell broadly on Tuesday as risk
appetite returned, with its index against a basket of major
currencies posting its biggest fall in nearly three weeks.
 ""When investors' risk appetite grows, the dollar becomes a
funding currency,"" said Junya Tanase, strategist at J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank.
 The dollar index fell 0.9 percent percent to 77.067 on
Tuesday, after dropping as low as 76.943 and breaking through
major support around 77.444. It last stood at 77.031.
 Data showing the U.S. manufacturing sector grew at its
fastest pace in nearly seven years last month bolstered hopes
that the economy was gaining traction, encouraging investors to
wade into risky trades.
 That meant more buying of the euro, which has been marred by
concerns over some euro zone countries' debt financing, as well
as of growth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3843 on Tuesday, its highest
since early November, as the common currency continued to benefit
from rising expectations that the European Central Bank will go
well ahead of its U.S. counterpart in raising rates.
 EGYPT CONCERNS EASE
 Surprisingly strong euro zone manufacturing data, which some
market players took as a sign that growth in Germany was
trickling down to others in the bloc, also bolstered the
currency. It last traded at $1.3828.
 The Australian dollar maintained Tuesday's 1.5 percent gain
to trade at $1.0110, with stronger commodity prices seen paving
the way for the currency to test resistance at $1.0152 and
$1.0183.
 Concerns in the financial markets that the Egyptian political
crisis could spread to other countries in the region abated at
least for now.
 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Tuesday that he
would step down in a few months once a successor is elected,
although it remains to be seen if that satisfies many protesters
who want him out immediately.
 ""It's not clear whether the chaos in Egypt is coming to an
end. But at least it's not affecting financial markets,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank.
 The dollar fell to a four-week low of 81.31 yen on EBS on
Tuesday and last traded at 81.41 yen.
 The dollar fell even as U.S. bond yields rose a tad, which
tends to help the dollar against the low-yielding yen, leading
some traders to expect more weakness in the dollar against the
yen in the near term.
 ""Broad selling pressure in the dollar from rising global
share prices appears to be overwhelming the impact of rising bond
yields,"" said J.P. Morgan's Tanase.
 Traders said the dollar could test this year's low of 80.93
yen, a break of which would open the way for a test of a 16-year
low just above 80 yen.
 The dollar was also within striking distance of a record low
against the Swiss franc, trading at 0.9360 franc, compared with
its record low of 0.9301 hit late last year.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks jumped on Tuesday
in a broad rally spurred by hopes of further economic recovery
after strong factory data worldwide, while safe-haven assets
such as bonds fell as worries about unrest in Egypt ebbed.
 U.S. benchmarks the Dow and S&P 500 closed at their highest
levels since June 2008 and looked poised for further gains as
corporate earnings continue to surprise on the upside. For
details see: [ID:nN01125275]
 The strong corporate picture and signs of an improving
economy eased investors' fears about possible economic fallout
from the political turmoil in Egypt, where President Hosni
Mubarak announced he will not seek re-election in September
after more than 1 million people gathered peacefully across the
country to demand that he step down. [ID:nLDE71000N]
 Investors capitalized on last week's pullback, sending the
Dow to close over the psychologically important level of 12,000
for the first time since June 2008 and the S&P 500 to close
above 1,300 for the first time since August 2008.
 ""While skeptics might attribute the recent ascent in stock
prices to animal spirits, we believe that fundamentals are the
real story behind the market's success,"" said Jonathan Golub,
strategist at UBS in New York.
 Shares of Pfizer Inc  gained 5.5 percent on
better-than-expected earnings and revenue, while United Parcel
Service Inc  rose 4.1 percent after profit beat
estimates and it forecast record-high earnings in 2011.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 148.23
points, or 1.25 percent, at 12,040.16. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 21.47 points, or 1.67 percent, at
1,307.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 51.11
points, or 1.89 percent, at 2,751.19.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI's all-country world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> jumped 1.6 percent.
 Stocks in Tokyo were poised to open slightly lower, with
the March futures contract that trades in Chicago for the
Nikkei 225 <0#NK:> down 5 points at 10,330.
 The euro hit a 2-1/2-month high above $1.38, boosted by an
acceleration of factory activity in the euro zone, even as
analysts said risk appetite could fade if worries resurface
over Europe's ability to manage its debt crisis.
[ID:nN01112999]
 The euro rose as high as $1.3844 , its highest since
early November, with gains accelerating after it broke above
resistance at $1.3786.
 The dollar, which benefited from a safe-haven bid late last
week when protests in Egypt intensified, fell broadly as risk
appetite returned, hitting a four-week low against the yen at
81.33 yen 
 The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX>, often called Wall
Street's fear index, fell for a second day, down almost 10
percent. The cost of five-year credit-default swaps on U.S.
debt also dipped in a sign of increased confidence.
 Oil prices in London rose, pushing above $102 a barrel as
disruptions at Egyptian ports and Jordan's government shake-up
kindled concerns about unrest in the region. But U.S. crude
prices fell in choppy trade ahead of weekly reports expected to
show domestic crude inventories rose last week.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for March  rose 73 cents
to settle at $101.74 a barrel.
 U.S. crude oil for March delivery  fell $1.42 to
settle at $90.77 a barrel.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell for a second day as
investors unwound flight-to-safety purchases that were spurred
by fears of contagion from the Egyptian unrest. For details
see: [ID:nN01395251]
 ""While the political unrest in Egypt continues, there does
not appear to be any significant impact on U.S. economic
conditions currently, thus the market's attention turned to the
economic data,"" said Sharon Stark, chief fixed income
strategist at Sterne Agee in Birmingham, Alabama.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 16/32 in price to yield 3.44 percent.
 U.S. gold futures ended up as a weaker dollar stirred
buying interest, but it failed to rally further after the U.S.
manufacturing data and relative peace in Egypt dampened the
precious metal's safe-haven appeal. [ID:nN01582717]
 Gold futures for deliver in April  settled up $5.8 at
$1,340.30 an ounce.
 Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei share index <.N225> rose
0.4 percent and the MSCI index of Asian shares outside of Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.4 percent.

 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's and
Chile's currencies hit nearly one-month highs on Tuesday and
Mexico's peso broke the 12 per dollar level after surveys
showed global factories were gaining steam in January.
 Bets that Brazil and Chile will raise interest rates to
cool strong growth and rising inflation have boosted the allure
of their currencies despite major intervention programs.
 A survey released on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing
sector expanded at its fastest pace in almost seven years in
January, following similar surveys showing growth in Europe's
and China's factories. For details, see [ID:nN01292459]
 Mexico's peso, which closely tracks the outlook for the
U.S. economy, led gains with a more than 1 percent surge to
strengthen past the psychological 12-per-dollar level.
 ""There was good data in Europe and good data in the United
States that are helping the whole risk trade,"" said Ramses
Villela, head of currency trading at Bulltick Capital Markets
in Mexico City, referring to bets on assets like stocks,
emerging market currencies and commodities.
 Chile's peso  bid 0.69 percent firmer at 479.70 per
U.S. dollar, driven by a record price for copper, the country's
main export.
 The Chilean peso has gained around 4 percent against the
dollar in since mid-January, cutting back into the 7 percent
loss it suffered after the central bank launched a $12 billion
currency intervention early last month.
 BACK BELOW 12
 Mexico's peso  firmed 1.04 percent to 11.99 per
dollar, nearing an almost 2-1/2-year high hit last month.
 The Mexican peso has gained more than 4 percent from a
November intraday low as improving U.S. economic data promises
to support solid demand for Mexico's exports.
 A monthly poll showed that analysts following Mexico's
economy raised their expectations for both growth and inflation
this year. But some analysts said the stronger peso will curb
the need for an interest rate hike in Mexico. [ID:nN0179180]
 ""We believe the currency appreciation will absorb the
inflation pressures from higher food prices and therefore allow
(Mexico's central bank) to leave the policy rate unchanged
throughout the year,"" wrote Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura
in New York, in a note to clients.
 Mexico placed 25 billion pesos ($2.08 billion) of a new
10-year bond on Tuesday with a yield of 7.44 percent.
 Brazil's real gained in spite of heavy intervention in the
previous session by the central bank, which held three
dollar-forward auctions and two spot-dollar auctions in a bid
to undermine the real's strength.
 ""The combination of lower risk aversion and expectations of
higher rates in Brazil beats anything they put there,"" said
Pedro Tuesta, senior Latin America economist at research firm
4Cast Inc in Washington. ""Money is still pouring in.""
 Brazil's economy is posting solid growth and the central
bank is seen raising its benchmark interest rates from 11.25
percent to 12.50 percent by year-end, boosting the appeal of
local assets to yield-hungry investors.
 The Brazilian real  was bid 0.6 percent stronger at
1.662 per U.S. dollar on the local spot market.

 TORONTO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar neared a
two-week high against a broadly weaker U.S. dollar on Tuesday,
spurred by strong manufacturing data that lifted hopes the
economic recovery was gaining traction and fed risk appetite.
 After grinding higher in the overnight session, the
currency extended gains quickly after the Institute for Supply
Management said the U.S. manufacturing sector grew at its
fastest pace in nearly seven years last month.
 That came on the heels of upbeat U.S. Midwest factory
activity and consumer spending figures on Monday. The latest
data was seen as good news for Canada, which relies heavily on
the much bigger U.S. market to buy most of its exports.
 ""It's a classic risk-on day inspired in large part by the
absolutely fantastic performance of the ISM indicator in the
U.S., and not just in the headline,"" said David Tulk, chief
Canada macro strategist at TD Securities.
 ""It was generally a very positive assessment about the
global economy from purchasing managers ... and it's one of
these days where the U.S. dollar is universally weak across the
board.""
 The Canadian currency  finished at C$0.9909 to the
U.S. dollar, or $1.009, up from C$1.0015 to the U.S. dollar, or
99.85 U.S. cents on Monday, when it had finished below parity
for a second straight session.
 It reached its highest level since Jan. 19 at C$0.9900 to
the U.S. dollar, or $1.0101, just before Ottawa lowered its
2011 growth estimate to 2.4 percent from 2.5 percent, based on
the median of private sector forecasters. It sees the economy
growing at 2.8 percent in 2012, unchanged from its previous
estimate. [ID:nN01111178]
 ""That's broadly consistent with what we expect. It's a
reasonably conservative approach to understanding the
likelihood of a budget coming into balance over the next five
to six years,"" said Tulk.
 Separately, the Bank of Canada urged corporate Canada to
invest and lower costs to stay competitive. The latest remarks
by Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem echoed those of Governor
Mark Carney, who recently said the private sector was losing
competitiveness and U.S. market share due to poor productivity
and high labor costs. [ID:nN27191953]
 No Canadian data is expected until the end of the week when
Statistics Canada releases the employment report for January.
On average, analysts expect a gain of 15,000 jobs in the month,
according to Reuters estimates. The jobless rate is expected to
remain steady at 7.6 percent. [ID:nN28144465]
 Finance Minister Jim Flaherty repeated on Tuesday his
concerns that the economic recovery remains fragile and that it
could be difficult to lower the unemployment rate.
 BOND PRICES SAG
 Canadian bond prices ended lower across the curve, in line
with the U.S. Treasury market, after the robust U.S. ISM data
weakened investor appetite for safe-haven government debt.
 ""Bonds have taken quite a shellacking after the strong ISM
number,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital
Markets. ""It seems to have spurred a wave of equity buying on
both sides of the border.""
 The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index gained
1.19 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.25
percent.
 The two-year bond  dropped 10 Canadian cents to
yield 1.708 percent, while the 10-year bond  shed 50
Canadian cents to yield 3.336 percent.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 2-1/2 month high
above $1.38 on Tuesday, boosted by solid global manufacturing
data, though analysts said risk appetite could fade if worries
resurface about Europe's ability to manage its debt crisis.
 At least 1 million people gathered peacefully in Egypt to
demand President Hosni Mubarak resign. Markets saw the crisis
contained, easing fears violent unrest could spread across the
Middle East. That dented safe-haven demand for dollars.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3836, its highest since early
November, with gains accelerating after it broke above
resistance at $1.3786. A close above $1.3750 would open the way
for a run toward $1.40, ""a slam dunk unless we get some kind of
surprise from Europe about the sovereign debt crisis,"" said Dan
Dorrow, head of research at FX execution firm Faros Trading.
 Extending its gains further may prove difficult, though,
and some traders said the $1.40 level would provoke selling.
 ""The euro anywhere near $1.40 is probably a sell if we get
up there,"" said Firas Askari, head of FX trading at BMO Capital
Markets in Toronto. ""I still think there are some core
fundamental issues in Europe that have not been addressed.""
 ""When the whole world starts buying and talking about the
strength of the euro,"" he added, ""it's probably a good time to
start fading it."" The euro was last up 1 percent at $1.3826.
 The European Union is said to be working on a plan to
reduce Greece's debt burden, though noting has been finalized.
 The dollar, which saw a safe-haven bid late last week when
protests in Egypt intensified, fell broadly as risk appetite
returned, hitting a four-week low of 81.32 yen and fell 1
percent to 0.9350 Swiss francs
 The Australian dollar rose 1.6 percent to $1.0125, just off
a four-week high, after policymakers gave an upbeat assessment
of the domestic and global economy.
 Traders said demand from Middle Eastern investors helped
lift the euro while Asian sovereigns were also seen buying back
euro positions sold earlier in the day.
 ECONOMIES ON MEND, PRICES PRESSURES GROWING
 Data showing the U.S. manufacturing sector grew at its
fastest pace in nearly seven years last month bolstered hopes
the economy was gaining traction, encouraging investors to wade
into risky trades. Separate data showed Germany's jobless rate
fell while euro zone factory activity accelerated.
 Global manufacturing surveys also showed rising raw
material prices, which analysts said would likely add to upward
pressure on currencies from emerging Asia.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet has
also flagged inflation risks lately, and investors expect him
to retain a hawkish tone on Thursday. 80 percent possibility
the ECB will raise rates by 25 basis points in August from the
current record low of 1.0 percent.
 High U.S. unemployment, meanwhile, and still manageable
core inflation has investors betting the Federal Reserve will
keep interest rates near zero for some time yet, undermining
the dollar's appeal.
 ""Even with good news, the Fed will be on hold for a long
time. That will increase flows into emerging markets and the
euro,"" Dorrow said.
 Speculation that rates will rise faster in Europe than in
the United States has kept the two-year yield spread between
German and U.S. government bonds at around 80 basis points, its
widest in two years.
 A record high for a UK manufacturing PMI helped drive
sterling to a 2-1/2-month high above $1.61 and boosted
expectations for an interest rate hike my mid-year.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks jumped more than
1 percent and safe-haven assets such as bonds fell on Tuesday
as news of strong manufacturing data worldwide lifted risk
appetites and worries about unrest in Egypt eased.
 The euro rallied to a 2-1/2-month high versus the U.S.
dollar while the price of copper, an industrial metal, hit a
record high near $10,000 a tonne as the economic data suggested
the global recovery continued to gather steam.
 The euro  was up 0.96 percent at $1.3817.
 U.S. oil prices < CLc1>, which had rallied in recent days
on fears that Mideast oil production could be disrupted because
of the unrest in Egypt, fell about 0.5 percent.
 The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX>, a gauge of investor
apprehension on Wall Street, fell for a second day, down about
10 percent. The cost of five-year credit-default swaps on U.S.
debt also dipped in a sign of increased confidence.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell for a second day as

 European shares posted their biggest gain in three weeks,
buoyed by strong manufacturing data from both the euro zone and
the United States. Oil shares got a boost from rising crude
prices in London. [ID:nLDE7100VZ]
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index rose 1.4
percent to end at 1,159.80 points.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI's all-country world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> jumped 1.6 percent.
 Pfizer Inc's  announcement of a $5 billion share
buyback and better-than-expected earnings at Chinese Internet
company Baidu  helped lift U.S. stock markets.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 122.16
points, or 1.03 percent, at 12,014.09. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 19.29 points, or 1.50 percent, at
1,305.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 50.49
points, or 1.87 percent, at 2,750.57.
 Worries that unrest in Egypt could spread to nearby major
oil-producing countries have helped drive up crude prices, but
some analysts have played down this risk.
 ""There is limited contagion risk from Egypt,"" said Bob
Parker, senior adviser at Credit Suisse. ""And there's been
strong economic data -- note the ISM number data out of the
United States.""
 The ISM manufacturing index climbed to 60.8 in January, its
fastest pace in nearly seven years, while manufacturing
activity in the euro zone accelerated last month.
[ID:nN01214408][ID:nLDE71017D]
 Crude prices in London rose as the Mideast is closer to
Europe, while the United States is much less reliant on oil
from the region.
 Brent crude futures in London were up 6 cents at $101.09 a
barrel, but U.S. crude oil futures were down 60 cents at $91.59
a barrel.
 Shipping sources said there were major disruptions in
Egypt's Alexandria and Damietta ports, pushing Brent swiftly
past $101.
 ""While we don't expect (oil) transit to be impacted, the
news of the port disruptions brings up the what-if?"" said
Amrita Sen, oil analyst at Barclays.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.85 percent at 77.073.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.87
percent at 81.36.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 16/32 in price to yield 3.44 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to a 2-1/2
month high versus the U.S. dollar on Tuesday after solid
manufacturing data worldwide though analysts said risk appetite
could fade given concern over the euro zone's debt problems.
 Easing fears Egypt's political unrest would spread in the
Middle East also helped boost the euro and higher-yielding
currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 The euro briefly climbed above $1.38 after taking out
resistance at $1.3786, its Nov. 22 high. Support is seen in the
$1.3750 area and a close above would open the way to a run
toward $1.40, a level that likely will attract selling
interest.
 ""To me euro anywhere near $1.40 is probably a sell if we
get up there,"" said Firas Askari, head of FX trading at BMO
Capital Markets in Toronto. ""I still think there are some core
fundamental issues in Europe that have not been addressed.""
 ""When the whole world starts buying and talking about the
strength of the euro, it's probably a good time to start fading
it,"" he said.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3815 on trading platform EBS,
its strongest since Nov. 11, before edging back to $1.3808, up
0.9 percent on the day.
 The U.S. dollar came under broad pressure as safe-haven
demand fell. It slipped to a four-week low of 81.42 yen on EBS,
while an index of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other
currencies fell as low as 77.092, its weakest since early
November.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in
nearly seven years in January, adding to evidence that the
economic recovery is gaining traction. Separate data showed a
fall in Germany's jobless rate and an acceleration in euro zone
manufacturing activity.
 ""The G-7 countries are continuing to pull out of the
recession,"" said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist at
Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""It's a good thing for the
global economy. But at the same time, we're seeing an increase
in risk appetite on the back of those numbers and that's
weighing on the U.S. dollar.""
 The Australian dollar soared 1.7 percent on the day to a
four-week high of $1.0138 after the country's central bank
ended its monthly policy meeting with a generally upbeat
assessment of the domestic and global economy.
 Traders said demand from Middle Eastern investors helped
lift the euro while Asian sovereigns were also seen buying back
euro positions sold earlier in the day, as well as buying
Australian dollars.
 HAWKISH ECB
 In the wake of Monday's above-forecast euro zone inflation,
the PMI surveys also showed rising price pressures, adding to
expectations that European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet will keep a hawkish tone on Thursday.80 percent
possibility the ECB will raise rates by 25 basis points in
August from the current record low of 1.0 percent.
 Investors now widely expect the Federal Reserve to lag far
behind other central banks -- notably the European Central Bank
and the Bank of England -- in raising interest rates.
 Speculation that rates will rise faster in Europe than in
the United States has kept the two-year yield spread between
German and U.S. government bonds at around 80 basis points, its
widest in two years.
 Robert Lynch, currency strategist at HSBC in New York, said
the outlook for the euro will largely depend on developments in
investors' appetite for risk and in peripheral euro zone bond
markets. ""They seem to be doing better, but I'm not convinced
that we'll be seeing the same thing consistently over the
course of the next two or three months,"" Lynch said.
 Sterling jumped to a 2-1/2-month high of $1.6156 after UK
manufacturing PMI hit a record high in January, boosting
expectations for a UK rate rise by mid-year. It was last up 0.7
percent at $1.6131.

 * Signals on Greek debt buyback, bigger rescue fund
 * Merkel pressing for EU to adopt German-style reforms
 * Regional elections dictate tough bargaining
 
 By Stephen Brown
 BERLIN, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Germany's resistance to expanding
a euro zone bailout fund and easing Greece's debt burden seems
to be softening as it scents a grand bargain in which European
states would commit to tough German-style economic reforms.
 Berlin officials still insist in public there is no need to
increase the size of the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF), and reject the possibility that Greece may be forced
into some form of debt restructuring.
 But in private they are setting out the negotiating position
for what Berlin sees as a package deal to be agreed in March,
ranging from altering the terms of Greek debt to ambitious
reforms of European pay and pensions.
 Senior German officials tell Reuters the government is now
actively discussing practical options for expanding the role of
the EFSF to alleviate Greece's debt dilemma.
 One option would be to empower the fund to lend Greece money
to buy back its own bonds in the market at a discount.
 ""But we have different opinions in the government. Some want
it, some don't,"" said one official, who asked not to be named.
 In a sign of Berlin's evolving position, Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble repeatedly declined in a weekend television
interview to rule out the possibility that Greece might need to
reschedule its debt.
 Many investors believe Greece cannot sustain payments on
debt projected to reach 158 percent of economic output in 2013
under a 110 billion euro EU/International Monetary Fund bailout.
 Since the crisis reignited due to fears about Greece's
ability to avoid a debt restructuring and about EFSF's ability
to cope with possible contagion to Portugal, Spain and beyond,
Berlin has again been accused of dragging its feet.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel attacked the European Commission
for publicly seeking an increase in the EFSF, which can actually
lend far less than its 440 billion euro headline figure due to
the need to hold money in reserve to ensure a top credit rating.
 So far, Berlin has spoken only about ways of maximising the
existing sum, but ministers hint privately they may be prepared
to go further if assured it will be a ""one shot"" solution.
 
 NO ""SALAMI SLICING""
 The government has warned euro zone partners against a
""salami-slicing"" approach because, with seven state elections
this year, it cannot afford to go to parliament repeatedly to
ask for additional aid, senior EU sources say.
 ""We must address these goals in one comprehensive package so
we don't have to readjust it every few months,"" Schaeuble told
WirtschaftsWoche business magazine.
 One factor in the background is horse-trading over who will
succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as head of the European Central Bank
late this year, although no one suggests openly that support for
German central banker Axel Weber is part of the euro bargain.
 It may be no accident that Weber has floated a plan to ease
Greece's debt burden without a default by extending the rescue
loans for 30 years, casting himself as an architect of the
possible solution to the euro zone crisis.
 Merkel has said repeatedly that Germany will do ""whatever it
takes"" to save the single currency, reiterating that message
last week in Davos after France's Nicolas Sarkozy.
 In a drive to lower the political cost of rescuing the euro
and shed her role as a nay-sayer at EU summits, she has gone on
the offensive, demanding a major shakeup of Europe's retirement
and wage-bargaining systems and of divergent corporate taxes.
 A paper from her office sets out reforms that, if imposed on
Europe, might convince Germany's voters and constitutional court
-- due to rule on the legality the EU rescue fund this year --
that Merkel is not throwing good money after bad.
[ID:nLDE70R1XX]
 It calls for euro zone states to emulate Germany's ""debt
brake"" constitutional amendment for fiscal discipline and move
towards its retirement age goal of 67, which would be difficult
for many European leaders including Sarkozy, whose more modest
pension reforms aroused huge protests last year.
 Spreading such measures across Europe would ""inspire
investor confidence and have the advantage of making it easier
for us politically"", said one German source.
 The paper seems influenced by less pro-European advisers
than Schaeuble, a 68-year-old veteran of Merkel's Christian
Democrats (CDU), whose stern but flexible approach to the crisis
contrasts with that of cabinet hardliners.
 
 ""GOOD RESULTS""
 After her re-election in 2009, the centre-right chancellor's
popularity fell last year amid voter anger at the Greek bailout
in May and the creation of a rescue mechanism for other states.
 Those moves contributed to the CDU's defeat in a state
election in North Rhine-Westphalia that cost Merkel her majority
in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament which represents
the 16 federal states.
 Fresh losses in regional elections such as in conservative
industrial bastion Baden-Wuerttemberg on March 27 would further
hinder Merkel's ability to legislate.
 Officials say tentative proposals to bring forward a euro
crisis summit by a few weeks from late March respond not to
complaints about German ""procrastination"" but to worries about
the impact on regional elections. [ID:nLDE70R26G]
 Domestic politics is shaping the argument within the German
government over the content as well as the timing of the
response, with Merkel keen to avoid taxpayers feeling they are
being sacrificed for European largesse.
 One coalition party in particular, the Free Democrats led by
Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, publicly
opposes expanding the EFSF, striking a tough stance in hopes of
reviving flagging support in state elections.
 But even Westerwelle, after being lobbied by fellow liberal
European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, told a
newspaper that expanding the EFSF was ""no taboo"" for his party,
and Germany's reticence was a negotiating position.
 ""I want good results. You don't get that if you declare your
price in public beforehand or draw lines in the sand,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied and the
euro rose to its highest versus the dollar in more than two
months on strong manufacturing data worldwide and easing fears
that Egypt's unrest would spread in the Middle East.
 But crude remained above $100 a barrel in London as traders
assessed the risk of unrest spreading to neighbors who are
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
[ID:nL3E7D107I]
 Global stocks jumped as manufacturing activity in the euro
zone accelerated in January, while an index of the U.S.
manufacturing sector rose to its highest level since May 2004.
 Major European stock indexes rose more than 1 percent, as
did the technology-rich Nasdaq composite in the United States.
 The strong economic data lifted copper to a record high and
tin prices also peaked.
 ""Manufacturing is outperforming other parts of the economy,

 Oil rose and remained above $100 a barrel in London, but
crude prices in New York fell.
 The uprising against the Egyptian government is unlikely to
disrupt tanker movement and oil flows along the strategic Suez

the restive mood in the region would support prices.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday to its
highest level against the dollar in more than two months after
solid euro zone economic data, though the rally could start to
fade given lingering worries over the region's debt problems.
 Easing concern over political unrest in Egypt also helped
boost the euro zone single currency. Analysts cautioned,
however, that it's premature to conclude that the global
fallout would be contained.
 The euro climbed above key resistance around $1.3740, the
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its November-January
fall. Traders said the move opened the way to a run toward
$1.40, a level that likely will attract selling interest.
 ""To me euro anywhere near $1.40 is probably a sell if we

 The euro  rose as high as $1.3776 on trading
platform EBS, its strongest since late November, before edging
back to $1.3759, up 0.5 percent on the day.
 The Australian dollar  rallied 1 percent on the day
to a four-week high of $1.0086 after the country's central bank

 * Banks need current capital, shouldn't pay extra dividendss

(Adds finance minister comments)
 STOCKHOLM, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Sweden's authorities may need
to set tougher rules for banks to make them reduce risk in
future than those planned under new international regulations,
central bank governor Stefan Ingves said on Tuesday.
 Sweden's banks have weathered the global downturn better
than many, despite a deep recession in the Baltic nations where
several of them had large exposures, and its banks are now among
the best-capitalised in Europe.
 Nevertheless, Ingves said in the text of a prepared speech
that the banks were particularly at risk from their heavy
dependence on funding from the international capital markets and
increased household borrowing.
 ""Against this background, I believe that there may be good
reasons to consider whether we, the Swedish authorities, ought
to adopt extra measures or proceed more quickly than planned in
Basel III,"" Ingves said.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg said he welcomed signs from
Ingves that Sweden should lead the way on bank regulation and
consider going even further than the Basel Committee.
 ""The Swiss have gone substantially further than Basel 2 and
Basel 3 concerning capital requirements for banks,"" he told
reporters. ""Stefan Ingves points out that we should do so too,
and this is of course an important signal that the government
must now think about.""
 Ingves said a number of steps should be considered.
 The introduction of new liquidity standards should be
brought forward, and there should be rules to make banks match
their foreign exchange lending with the equivalent amount of
borrowing. 
 To dampen household borrowing, which has been rising
sharply, Ingves said Sweden could introduce reserve requirements
against such lending, increase the capital requirements or
increase the risk weighting for mortgages.
 SEB analyst Elisabeth Kopelman said that given the
authorities' concerns, it was likely that new measures would be
taken in addition to the recent introduction of a loan-to-value
ceiling on mortgage borrowing.
 Ingves said Swedish banks were well-capitalised and should
not face any additional costs for raising capital.
 ""However, the Swedish banks need to retain the capital they
have at present and, therefore, should not pay any extra
dividends,"" he said.
 The Nordic banking index was little changed after Ingves's
remarks, trading roughly flat on the day.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2011 09:16AM ET</span>",Egypt bank closures cut off vital Gulf remittances," * Banks in Egypt closed since Sunday
 * Egypt relies heavily on remittances from Gulf
 
 DUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The closure of Egyptian banks has
prevented Gulf-based Egyptians, who make up the bulk of the
population living abroad, from sending vital remittances back to
the North African country, exchange operators said on Tuesday.
 Egypt, racked by political unrest as demonstrators bid to
end President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule, is heavily reliant
on funds from its citizens abroad.
 The World Bank estimates about $7.6 billion was remitted to
Egypt in 2010.
 But most money transfer firms conduct business through
Egyptian banks, leaving recipients empty-handed after the
central bank ordered lenders to close on Sunday.
 Banks will remain shut on Wednesday and the central bank
said it is still assessing whether they will shut again on
Thursday. [ID:nLDE71014L]
 ""We couldn't make a single transfer to Egypt,"" said Mohammed
al-Ansari, chairman and managing director of the UAE's Al Ansari
Exchange in Abu Dhabi. ""On Sunday, we got a lot of interest but
we cannot do anything for now.
 ""Usually we have big volumes at the first of the month, when
salaries are paid.""
 Al Ansari, who said Egypt accounts for about 4 to 5 percent
of volumes at his firm, said he expected customers to switch to
U.S. dollars from Egyptian pounds once banks reopened. The
Egyptian currency  has hit six-year lows amid the unrest.
 ""As soon as it will open, we expect big volumes, mostly for
family needs, not even for investments,"" he said. ""Seventy-five
percent of transfers were in Egyptian pounds because it was a
stable currency. But we expect that to change to now.""
 Remittances from Egyptians abroad rose 39 percent to $9.75
billion in the 2009-10 fiscal year, an Egyptian foreign affairs
ministry official was quoted as saying last month.

70 percent of the approximately 6 million Egyptians working

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to its highest
against the dollar in more than two months on Tuesday, boosted
by signs that increasing inflation pressures will prompt a much
faster rise in euro zone than U.S. interest rates.
 The Australian dollar also hit a four-week high against the
dollar, buoyed by upbeat central bank comments, while strong UK
data lifted sterling to a 2-1/2 month maximum, driving the U.S.
currency to its lowest since early November against a basket of
currencies.
 Traders said demand from Middle Eastern investors helped
lift the euro, while Asian sovereigns were also seen buying back
euro positions sold earlier in the day, as well as buying
Australian dollars.
 Investors now widely expect the Federal Reserve to lag far
behind other central banks -- notably the European Central Bank
and the Bank of England -- in raising interest rates.
 ""Major currencies are ganging up on the dollar at the
moment. The euro, Aussie and sterling all have their own
independent reasons for rising which are all anchored to signs
of stronger growth,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
nabCapital.
 ""The question now is whether euro/dollar can make a break
above the $1.37/1.38 area and establish some support there"".
 The euro rose as high as $1.3776, its strongest since late
November, before edging back to $1.3737, up 0.4 percent on the
day. 
 Some easing in concern over political unrest in Egypt helped
the single currency as did a fall in Germany's jobless rate and
strong final readings of purchasing managers' surveys,
supporting the view the overall euro zone recovery is
progressing.
 
 HAWKISH ECB 
 In the wake of Monday's above-forecast euro zone inflation,
the PMI surveys also showed rising price pressures, adding to
expectations that European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet will keep a hawkish tone on Thursday.
 Implied interest rate futures suggest a nearly 80 percent
possibility the ECB will raise rates by 25 basis points in
August from the current record low of 1.0 percent.
 Speculation that rates will rise has kept the two-year yield
spread between German and U.S. government bonds at around 80
basis points, its widest in two years.
 ""Relative rate spreads are still favouring the euro to the
dollar,"" said John Hydeskov, currency strategist at Danske.
 The euro broke above $1.3740, around the 61.8 percent
retracement of its November-January fall, which technical
analysts said provided support and may open the way to $1.40.
 The U.S. currency slipped to a four-week low around 81.47
yen, also helping to push the dollar index, which tracks the
U.S. currency's value against a basket of other currencies, as
low as 77.294, its weakest since early November.
 
 AUSSIE RALLY
 The Australian dollar rallied 1 percent on the day to a
four-week high of $1.0080 after the country's central bank ended
its monthly policy meeting with a generally upbeat assessment of
the domestic and global economy.
 Sterling jumped to a 2 1/2-month high of $1.6143 after UK
manufacturing PMI hit a record high in January, adding more
evidence that the sector is expanding while price pressures
build, feeding the argument for a UK rate rise by mid-year.
 ""Markets are pricing in more chances of rate hikes and there
is little to undermine sterling at the moment,"" said Adrian
Schmidt, FX strategist at Lloyds TSB.
 The Swedish crown also rallied, knocking the euro to a
10-year low of 8.786 crowns, after an above-forecast Swedish
purchasing managers' survey.

 * Next General Council session in July
 * Support for Russian membership still strong 

(Recasts, adds background, quote)
 By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Russia's talks to join the World
Trade Organisation will extend into May, Russia's chief
negotiator said on Tuesday, pushing possible accession closer to
elections that could complicate Russia's 17-year bid.
 Russian WTO negotiator Maxim Medvedkov said the talks could
run beyond the spring session of the WTO's top body which
approves membership, though he hoped membership could still be
wrapped up by the summer.
 Russia applied to join the WTO's predecessor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), in June 1993 and its $1.5
trillion economy is by far the largest economy outside the
153-member organisation.
 Medvedkov told Reuters that the last round of informal talks
in Geneva reviewed changes to a so-called Working Party report
that had to be made after Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan set up
a tripartite customs union.
 ""We have reviewed nearly two thirds of all changes. The next
informal consultations we will have in March and then we will
probably need another one to complete work on the report,"" he
said in an interview.
 ""Most likely it may happen in May or June.""
 The report serves as the basis for a membership bid but must
be approved by the WTO's General Council which convenes every
two months. The next session of the Council takes place in July.
 ""There are no serious problems there,"" Medvedkov said.
 Kremlin economic advisor Arkady Dvorkovich said recently
that Russia aims to wrap up negotiations by the spring session
of the Council at the start of May. Otherwise, he said, it would
have to wait until the autumn session.
 President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and
WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy have all said Russia could join
the trade group this year.
 Officials in the Kremlin and the White House are seeking
Russian WTO entry ahead of Russia's March 2012 presidential
election and the November 2012 presidential election in the
United States.
 A failure to push through the accession in autumn 2011 may
delay the Russian membership until 2013, as the bid could be
stalled by electoral politics in both countries.

 RAPID ACCESSION
 Both the United States and European Union, Russia's biggest
trade partner, have expressed support for Russian membership.
 U.S. support for Russia's WTO bid and the New START nuclear
arms treaty, ratified by Russia's parliament last week, are part
of President Barack Obama's ""reset"" in relations with Russia.
Medvedkov said other issues that remain unresolved are
agricultural subsidies and meat tariffs. He said his team was
holding bilateral talks with interested parties on both issues.
 Agricultural subsidies are the only issue that remains
unresolved with the United States and EU, he added.
 He noted that smaller countries were raising some new issues
sensing that the accession process was entering the final stage
but declined to go into details.
""Overall everyone supports our rapid accession,"" Medvedkov
said, adding that new questions concerned phytosanitary and
veterinary control measures as well as technical regulation.
 Medvedkov said Georgia, which threatened to block the
accession over customs controls at the border between Russia and
two Georgian breakaway regions, took part in the consultations
but this time did not raise any issues.
 Russia has repeatedly dismissed Georgian demands to have
customs officers at the border it does not control as
""political"", saying they have nothing to do with international
trade and therefore should not be taken into consideration.

(Adds CEO comment, updates share)
 By Niklas Pollard and Johannes Hellstrom
 STOCKHOLM, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Sweden's SKF, the world's
biggest bearings maker, said it faced adverse currency movements
due to a stronger crown and rising raw materials costs after
posting a smaller-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter profit.
 SKF shares were down 6.7 percent at 171.7 crowns by 1334
GMT, underperforming the broader market, while peers Atlas Copco
and Sandvik dipped 1.0 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.
 SKF, a barometer for the manufacturing sector with its
bearings used in items ranging from jets to dishwashers, said it
expected demand in the first quarter to be slightly higher than
in the three months just ended.
 ""However, we will face headwinds due to currency and higher
raw material costs, adding to those faced in the fourth
quarter,"" the company said.
 Earnings at SKF, the first of Sweden's blue-chip engineers
to post results in the fourth quarter, have bounced back thanks
to a rapid recovery in demand and cost cuts carried out during
the global financial crisis.
 ""The report is a bit light, and they point to the continued
headwind from currencies and raw materials. The deviations are
quite small, but when you come in below the mean forecast it is
natural the stock dips,"" Swedbank analyst Mats Liss said.
 Pretax earnings at SKF rose to 2.05 billion crowns ($312
million) from 765 million a year earlier, compared with the 2.08
billion forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 analysts.
 
 CROWN WORRIES
 The company stayed out of the red during the deepest gloom
of the global crisis and left management sufficiently confident
to raise long-term financial targets.
 Since then the stock has risen roughly 20 percent, putting
its gains over the past year at about 60 percent, amid a broad
upturn in Swedish engineering stocks that include Atlas Copco
and Sandvik, both reporting on Wednesday.
 The challenge for SKF is to cater to strong demand, led by
booming growth in China and Latin America, while keeping a lid
on costs to defend its higher valuation.
 A strengthening Swedish crown has become a worry in recent
months. SKF estimated currency swings would dent operating
earnings by 150 million crowns in the first quarter and 900
million for the full year.
 Also, prices of raw materials such as metals have risen
after booming growth in emerging markets.
 SKF Chief Executive Tom Johnstone told a news conference
that the company had raised its own prices in November to help
offset the rising raw material costs and would be looking at
further pricing measures.
 ""I do expect that we -- with the actions we have taken on
pricing, with cost reductions and sourcing actions -- will be
able to manage the raw material costs as we have done in the
past,"" Johnstone said.
 SKF said fourth-quarter sales rose to 15.4 billion crowns
from a year-ago 13.9 billion, to come in shy of the mean 15.7
billion forecast by analysts and Johnstone said sales volumes
were expected to grow slightly less in the first quarter.
 The company proposed raising its annual dividend to 5 crowns
per share from 3.50 the previous year, topping the mean forecast
of 4.77.

 * Eurobond would have 10-15 year maturity, benchmark size
 * Floater bonds important part of domestic financing
 
 By Jason Hovet and Robert Mueller
 PRAGUE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is drawing up
plans for a 10-15-year benchmark Eurobond of at least one
billion euros, with timing to be decided after the government
agrees its main fiscal reforms in early spring, the ministry's
debt chief said.
 In a Reuters interview, the ministry's debt department head
Petr Pavelek said he expected the reform plans to send a strong
signal to investors but that the central European country was
under no urgency to tap international markets at the moment.
 ""There is no pressure on our side. The domestic market is in
good shape, we have enough of a cash buffer,"" he said. ""The
crown is another aspect to take into account with the timing of
the issue.""
 The Czechs sold 2 billion euros worth of a 3.625 percent
coupon Eurobond maturing in April 2021 in September at 105 basis
points over mid-swaps. 
 The Czech Republic has an 'A' rating from Standard and
Poor's and 'A1' rating from Moody's.
 Pavelek said the next issue would be at least a benchmark
size, or 1 billion euros, which could be raised if demand is
high. 
 He said he hoped for better pricing than in the last issue.
 Czech yield spreads over German Bunds have narrowed around
20 basis points since the start of the year to 83.5 basis points
on the Czech benchmark 2019 bond.
 The Czech Republic sees its gross borrowing need dropping to
219.5 billion Czech crowns in 2011 from 251.6 billion last year.
 The Czech centre-right government won power last year with
deficit-cutting pledges and markets are now watching for reform
plans to the pension, health and welfare systems. 
 Ratings agencies have said implementation of the reforms may
lead to a credit upgrade. Prime Minister Petr Necas has said he
wanted reforms ready by early March so they reach lawmakers
before the summer recess.
 ""We expect (details on reform plans) should be a positive
signal for markets. We would like to be ready from the
documenation and legal side as soon as possible,"" Pavelek said.
 Demand for Czech debt has stayed high since the ministry
sold a 2 billion euros Eurobond in September. Bids at the first
two domestic auctions of the year doubled the offer, while the
crown rose 3 percent versus the euro in January, making domestic
debt more attractive.
 
 MORE MARKET TRANSPARENCY
 Pavelek said his department would stick to a strategy of
selling only the indicated offer amount at domestic auctions,
started late last year to improve market transparency. Before it
often sold more than planned, upsetting some market players.
 Pavelek said the ministry was looking at changing auctions
in the second half of the year to possibly sell more than what
it is now able to offer -- 85 percent of the offered amount --
in the first, competitive round of auctions. 
 The rest is offered in a second round where demand drops
off.
 ""It is clear that in the non-competitive part we are not
able to reach the indicated amount,"" he said.
 The change would come with plans to implement a new
electronic second market platform based on market-making.
 He said the ministry planned to sell 30 to 40 percent of
domestic debt in the form of variable-rate bonds this year.
 The Czechs have sold 56.5 billion crowns of a floating rate
bond due 2016, with the last sale in January producing an
average yield of 27.211 basis points over the 6-month interbank
rate.
The ministry has said it would also introduce a new
variable-rate bond due 2023 tied to the 12-month PRIBOR in the
coming quarter.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2011 07:08AM ET</span>",GLOBAL ECONOMY-PMI surveys hint at deeper-seated inflation," * Signs factories passing rising costs onto customers
 * European manufacturers increasing production
 * China factory growth eases; India accelerates slightly
 * Analysts say more monetary tightening is needed
 
 By Jonathan Cable and Aileen Wang
 LONDON/BEIJING, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Costs for Asian and
European manufacturers jumped in January as firms ramped up
production, surveys showed on Tuesday, the latest evidence of
growing pressure on global inflation from food and fuel prices.
 Inflation has rapidly hurtled to the top of the policy
agenda around the globe, but in many cases it is not clear if
rises in the cost of raw materials will lead to consumer price
hikes that would force central banks to up interest rates soon.
 Purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs) suggested both that the
economic recovery was gaining momentum in Europe -- boosting
demand for goods -- and also that firms have managed to pass on
some of their increased costs to their customers.
 For the 17-nation euro zone bloc, the PMI input price gauge
jumped to its highest since the survey began in 1997, while
across the channel in Britain there was substantial growth in
both input costs and factory gate prices.
 ""The obvious culprits are food and energy prices,"" said Mark
Miller, global macroeconomist at Lloyds Banking Group. ""The
increases in commodity prices that we have seen very recently
are likely to persist.""
 Rising food and fuel prices have already hit poorer
countries and are one of the factors behind massive
anti-government protests in Egypt and in Tunisia, whose
president was ousted last month.
 The European data, compiled by Markit from comprehensive
surveys of private sector business, are likely to add to
speculation that central banks will soon have to raise the
record low interest rates held in place since the global
financial crisis set in.
 
 BACK-TO-BACK 
 Input costs for Chinese manufacturers also rebounded in
January, according to the official PMI. The comparable input
price index for India rose for a seventh straight month, while
factory gate prices were up for the fourth month in a row.
 ""This provides a further reason to think that headline
inflation is likely to pick up in the next few months,"" said
Brian Jackson, economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 In South Korea, official data showed inflation rose above
the central bank target to hit a three-month high of 4.1
percent. Manufacturing input prices as measured by the PMI
soared to a nearly two-year high, boosting the case for an
interest rate hike next week, which would mark a rare
back-to-back streak.
 In the euro zone, the European Central Bank is expected to
leave rates on hold at their record low of 1.0 percent when it
meets on Thursday. But there is growing speculation that the
Governing Council will act sooner rather than later to quell
rising prices.
 Euro zone consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in January, well
above the ECB's preferred two percent ceiling, data showed on
Monday. And British inflation rose to 3.7 percent in December,
almost twice the Bank of England's target.
 While the world economy has begun improving it is beset by
problems such as high unemployment and rising prices which could
fuel crippling trade protectionism or even lead to war within
nations, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned on
Tuesday.
 
 GROWTH GROWS
 Manufacturing activity in the euro zone accelerated in
January, suggesting the sector is regaining momentum across the
region, with the notable exception of battered Greece, while
British growth was the fastest since records began in 1992.
 But in China, tighter policy began to bite, producing a
bigger-than-expected slowdown in manufacturing growth, though
the country's factories were still well into expansionary
territory.
 China's official PMI fell to a five-month low in January,
the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said but
analysts warned the results were likely distorted by a closure
of factories ahead of China's Lunar New Year.
 A separate PMI sponsored by HSBC pointed in the opposite
direction, edging up in January and with a slight easing in
input price inflation.
 Taken together, the two surveys painted a picture of sticky
inflation and a moderate slowdown in the world's second-largest
economy after 10.3 percent growth last year, which was
generating an inflation rate of 4.6 percent in December.
 ""This will only reinforce the overriding theme of policy
tightening to contain inflationary pressures,"" said Charlie Lay,
economist at Forecast PTE in Singapore.
 So far, Chinese officials have moved tentatively on rates
and the currency, and instead leaned heavily on administrative
measures, raising banks' reserve requirements seven times since
the start of last year and capping their lending, while also
cracking down on property speculation.
 The India PMI also edged up in January.
 The Reserve Bank of India raised interest rates last week by
a quarter of a percentage point to clamp down on resurgent
inflation and warned of persistently higher food prices unless
steps are taken to boost supplies.
 The central bank has already raised policy rates seven times
since March, saying the balance of risks had tilted towards
stronger inflation and it was ready to respond if price
pressures increased.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The euro approached a two-month
high against a broadly weaker dollar on Tuesday, boosted by
speculation that increasing inflation pressures will prompt a
much faster rise in euro zone interest rates than U.S. ones.
 The dollar tumbled across the board, hitting a 12-week low
against a currency basket as investors say the Federal Reserve
will lag far behind the European Central Bank, the Bank of
England and other central banks in raising interest rates.
 ""Relative rate spreads are still favouring the euro to the
dollar,"" said John Hydeskov, currency strategist at Danske.
 ""Pressure has intensified for the ECB to do something about
inflation when it meets on Thursday. The ECB has hiked rates
when inflation was previously at this level, so it's possible
they could do it again.""
 Data on Monday showed a 2.4 percent year-on-year jump in
euro zone inflation.
 Investors expect ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet to keep
his hawkish tone when the central bank holds a policy meeting on
Thursday, as inflation hovers above the central bank's target of
just below 2 percent for the second month.
 Implied interest rate futures suggest a roughly 60 percent
possibility the ECB will raise rates by 25 basis points in July,
from the current record low of 1.0 percent.
 Speculation in the past week that rates will rise has
widened the two-year yield spread between euro zone and U.S.
government bonds to around 80 basis points, its widest in two
years.
 In early European trade, the euro rose as high as around
$1.3758, a whisper away from a two-month high of $1.3760 hit
late last week, before pulling back to $1.3720, up 0.2 percent
on the day.
 Traders said selling by Asian sovereign names had pulled the
euro away from its session high, adding the single currency was
well supported as market concern over political unrest in Egypt
abated somewhat.
 The pair hovered near $1.3739, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement of its November-January fall. Technical analysts
said a sustained move above that level would open the way to
$1.40.
 The U.S. currency slipped to a four-week low around 81.77
yen, helping to push the dollar index, which tracks the U.S.
currency's value against a basket of other currencies, as low as
77.413, its weakest since early November.
 
 AUSSIE RALLIES
 The Australian dollar rallied 0.7 percent to a session high
of $1.0047 after the country's central bank ended its monthly
policy meeting with a generally upbeat assessment of the
domestic and global economy.
 The RBA kept its key cash rate unchanged at 4.75 percent,
saying the impact of flood damage in Queensland would be
temporary and it was still very much focused on the medium-term
outlook for solid growth..
 ""The market was positioned for a more dovish slant from the
RBA, perhaps expecting the bank to cut flood-hit Queenslanders
some slack,"" Citi said in a note.
 Analysts expected offers to emerge ahead of $1.0050, which
may cool the Australian currency's rally in the short term.
 The Swedish crown rallied, knocking the euro to a 10-year
low of 8.786 crowns, after an above-forecast Swedish purchasing
managers' survey.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Investors shifted their focus from
Middle East turmoil to concentrate on improved economic data and
corporate results on Tuesday, lifting global stocks.
 Wall Street looked set to join in and open higher.
 Inflation expectations boosted the euro, helping drive the
dollar to a 12-week low against a group of other currencies.
 The price of oil, the most sensitive indicator of market
unease about Egypt, eased, although Brent crude remained a few
cents above $100 a barrel.
 Egyptians were protesting en masse, demanding an end to the
30-year-rule of President Hosni Mubarak.
 Oil dipped, however, on news of China's factory growth
cooling to a five-month low, signalling demand may rise more
slowly in the world's second-largest oil user.[ID:nTOE71000X]
 The Egyptian crisis has prompted bursts of risk aversion on
financial markets over the past few days but investors on
Tuesday were trading on expectations of better prospects for the
world economy.
 Manufacturing activity in the euro zone accelerated more
than previously thought in January, indicating the sector is
regaining momentum across most of the region with the notable
exception of Greece. [ID:nSLAVCE7O2]
 Investors were earlier encouraged by upbeat U.S. Midwest
factory activity and consumer spending figures on Monday.
 ""There is confidence in the market as companies are
reporting good figures,"" said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity
markets strategist at Deutsche Postbank in Bonn.
 German chipmaker Infineon , for example, raised
its full-year outlook, anticipating strong demand from the
automotive and industrial sectors.
 Credit Suisse, meanwhile, upgraded Greek equities to
""benchmark"" from ""underweight"", citing cheap equity valuations
and a range of supportive macroeconomic factors. Athens' leading
share index <.ATG> gained 12.7 percent last month after being
battered during the debt crisis.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> gained half
a percent, with Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> up 0.8
percent.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> earlier closed up 0.36 percent.
 Developed market stock indexes are generally in positive
territory for the year. By contrast, Citi reported that most
core government bonds lost money in January.

 DOLLAR FALLS
 The dollar fell to a 12-week low against a basket of
currencies, driven lower as the euro extended gains in the wake
of above-forecast inflation data.
 The dollar index <.DXY> fell to its weakest since early
November.
 The euro rallied to its highest against the dollar in more
than two months. It was at $1.3735 , buoyed by the view
that euro zone interest rates would rise before U.S. rates.
 ""Relative rate spreads are still favouring the euro to the
dollar,"" said John Hydeskov, currency strategist at Danske.
""Pressure has intensified for the ECB to do something about
inflation when it meets on Thursday.""
 Demand for euro zone government debt fell, pushing up
longer-term yields.
 The premium investors demand to hold lower-rated euro zone
government bonds rather than German debt fell, after the release
of the PMI and better-than-expected details of Spanish savings
banks' exposure to property and bad loans.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2011 04:04AM ET</span>",Euro zone Jan factory PMI up as periphery picks up," * Factory sector grows faster in Jan than earlier thought
 * Survey shows periphery is displaying signs of recovery
 * Input prices rise at fastest rate in survey history
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the euro
zone accelerated more than previously thought in January,
indicating the sector is regaining momentum across most of the
region with the notable exception of battered Greece, a survey
showed on Tuesday.
 ""The data also show a reassuring improvement in the
periphery, for manufacturing at least, with Ireland and Italy in
particular seeing growth leap higher in January,"" said Chris
Williamson at data provider Markit.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), which records manufacturing activity across all the major
euro area economies, rose to 57.3 in January from 57.1 in
December, exceeding an earlier flash estimate of 56.9.
 Companies, however, faced surging cost pressure with input
prices rising at the fastest pace since the survey began in June
1997, adding to signs of rising inflation pressure in other
sectors of the economy and raising the risk the European Central
Bank will have to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
 This is the 16th month the index has been above the 50.0
mark that divides growth from contraction and is its highest
reading since April. The euro zone's eight biggest economies all
saw manufacturing growth last month, with the exception of
Greece.
 ""Manufacturing continued to act as an important driver of
economic growth at the start of 2011. The increase in production
regained momentum after a lull last autumn, to run only slightly
slower than the surging pace seen in the second quarter of last
year,"" Williamson said.
 The euro zone economy grew at its fastest pace in four years
between April and June last year, expanding 1 percent, but a
Reuters poll predicted the bloc's economy will grow by between
just 0.3 and 0.4 percent per quarter through to the end of 2012.

 Germany's core PMI rose from a flash reading to 60.5 but was
virtually unchanged from December's five-month high while
France's PMI fell as growth in activity slowed.
 Italy saw the first growth in manufacturing since June 2006
while Spain's reading nudged up to its highest level since
April.
 The euro zone survey's output index leapt to 59.4 last
month, up from December's 58.4 and the flash reading of 58.6,
and it's highest since April while new orders held at December's
eight-month peak.

PRICING PRESSURE
 The input price index, although down from a flash reading
for 79.8, still notched up its highest final reading since the
survey began in June 1997 at 79.2. In December it was at 74.1.
Markit attributed higher costs to rising prices for fuel,
food and metals and output price inflation reached a
two-and-a-half year high -- indicating firms were able to pass
on at least some of their higher costs to customers.
 ""Inflation worries will be stoked by a record rise in
manufacturers' raw material prices, which firms subsequently
passed on to customers in the form of higher selling prices,""
said Williamson.
Euro zone consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in January, well
above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target, official
data showed on Monday. [ID:nBRLVCE7AU] Economists are divided on
whether the ECB will start raising interest rates late this year
or hold off until the first quarter of 2012.
 Figures due on Thursday are expected to confirm the bloc's
dominant service sector PMI held steady after a flash reading of
55.2.

 SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - South Korea's Hanjin Shipping
was re-routing some of its container vessels due to
the unrest in Egypt that has disrupted drydock operations at
several ports, its chief executive said on Tuesday.	
 Seaborne traffic through Egypt's Suez Canal continued to run
smoothly, industry officials said, but many vessels were
bypassing Egyptian ports and stopping at other countries instead
to refuel, change crew and resupply.	
 The maritime industry was closely watching developments in
Egypt, fearing that an escalation in violence could force the
Suez Canal to shutdown and force vessels to travel an extra
6,000 miles around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.	
 ""Yes, our operation is affected as Port Said and Alexandria
are either partially open or entirely not operating due to a
lack of labour and IT systems,"" Hanjin's President and CEO Young
Min Kim told Reuters in an email.	
 ""We are arranging to discharge some transshipment boxes at
the next port for the time being,"" he added.	
 
 Kim did not say how many of its 200 vessels were affected
and where they were being re-routed to.	
 More than 34,000 vessels passed through the Suez Canal in
2009, of which about half docked at Egyptian ports to pick up
supplies, military escorts and new crew members, industry
officials said.	
 DP World Limited and Danish shipping firm A.P.
Moller-Maersk on Monday suspended their Egyptian
port terminal operations due to the unrest.	
 
 BYPASSING EGYPTIAN PORTS	
 Some container vessels that were initially ordered to
discharge in Egypt were instead unloading and docking in
Singapore, one of the world's busiest ports, said a senior
shipping executive in Hong Kong.	
 Several other companies, however, said their shipping
operations had not been affected by the political instability in
Egypt.	
 ""So far none of our ships have experienced any problems. In
fact, one of them went through the Suez Canal a few days ago
after the start of the unrest in Egypt without any issues,"" said
Khalid Hashim, managing director of the Thai-listed firm
Precious Shipping .	
 Hong Kong-based dry bulk shipping firm Pacific Basin
also said it was operating in the region as normal.	
 The container industry was expected to be the most affected
should the Suez Canal close, analysts said.	
 More than 300 container vessels traveled through the canal
in the first three weeks of this year, compared to 107 dry bulk
carriers and 95 oil tankers, according to shipping and logistics
firm GAC.	
 ""We suggest that the real result of a canal closure to be
reflected in retail and manufacturing price hikes caused by the
... detour container ships en route to Europe from the East
would require,"" said George Los, analyst for Charles R. Weber
Research in a weekly report.	
 Cargo travelling south through the canal totalled 295.4
million tonnes, while north-bound vessels carried 263 million
tonnes in 2009, according to industry estimates.

instability

people
 * Pattern of earlier global imbalances re-emerging
(Adds more details from speech)	
 By Kevin Lim and Saeed Azhar	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The world economy is beset by
problems such as high unemployment and rising prices which could
fuel trade protectionism and even lead to war within nations,
the head of the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday.	
 Rising food and fuel prices in recent months have already
hit poorer countries and are one of the factors behind massive
anti-government protests in Egypt and in Tunisia, whose
president was ousted last month. 
 ""As tensions between countries increase, we could see rising
protectionism -- of trade and of finance. And as tensions within
countries increase, we could see rising social and political
instability within nations - even war,"" Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said in a speech in Singapore. 
 Strauss-Kahn noted two ""dangerous"" imbalances that he said
could sow the seeds of the next crisis.	
 The first was the unbalanced recovery across countries, as
emerging nations grow much faster than developed economies and
possibly overheat. The second was the social strains within
countries with high unemployment and widening income gaps.	
 Over the next decade, 400 million young people would join
the global labour force, posing a daunting challenge for
governments, Strauss-Kahn added.	
 ""We face the prospect of a 'lost generation' of young
people, destined to suffer their whole lives from worse
unemployment and social conditions. Creating jobs must be a top
priority not only in the advanced economies, but also in many
poorer countries.""	
 Unemployment stands at 9.4 percent in the United States
while European countries are struggling to create jobs.	
 Despite high joblessness in the wake of the 2008 global
credit crisis, trade barriers have not reached levels feared by
many analysts. Instead, a number of countries, most prominently
China according to its critics, have sought to keep their
currencies undervalued to keep exports humming.	
 ""The pre-crisis pattern of global imbalances is
re-emerging,"" Strauss-Kahn said.	
 ""Growth in economies with large external deficits, like the
U.S., is still being driven by domestic demand. And growth in
economies with large external surpluses, like China and Germany,
is still being powered by exports.""	
 Strauss-Kahn said the IMF expected subdued growth of 2.5
percent for advanced economies this year as high unemployment
and household debt weighed on domestic demand.	
 Emerging markets would grow at a faster pace of 6.5 percent,
with Asia excluding Japan expanding by 8.5 percent, he said.	
 Strauss-Kahn said the ""global growth gap"" was straining the
recovery in other ways, with energy prices rising swiftly,
reflecting the rapid growth in emerging economies. 
 ""Food prices are rising too -- though here supply shocks are
the main reason with potentially devastating consequences
for low-income countries. Together, these price increase are
beginning to feed into headline inflation,"" he said. 
 The U.N. food agency said last month that global food prices
hit a record high in December, above 2008 levels when riots
broke out in countries as far afield as Egypt, Cameroon and
Haiti.	
 Strauss-Kahn added that foreign exchange rate adjustments
had an important role to play in addressing global economic
imbalances and should not be resisted.	
 ""Holding back such adjustment in one country also makes it
harder, and more costly, for other countries to let their
exchange rate adjust,"" he said.	
 Chinese policymakers were moving in the right direction by
taking steps to bolster domestic demand, he noted. The United
States and many other Western countries continue to push Beijing
to let its yuan currency appreciate faster.

paragraph 14)
 * GM considers adding new China plants in 2011 and after
 * Capacity remains tight even as market growth moderates
 * To begin to export Sail kits to South America this year
 * Eyes exporting substantial amount of Sail cars from China
(Adds more executives quotes, details)
 By Fang Yan and Ken Wills
 BEIJING, Feb 1 (Reuters) - General Motors, the top U.S.
automaker, is considering adding new plants in China in 2011 and
after, a senior executive said on Tuesday, as it moves to meet
steady demand in the world's top auto market.
 GM, which competes with Toyota Motor Corp and other top
global manufacturers, is also planning to export a ""substantial
amount"" of its Chevrolet Sail small cars from China to other
emerging markets in the coming years, said Terry Johnsson, vice
president of the automaker's China operations.
 Global industry giants, from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG to
Volkswagen, have racked up eye-popping sales in China, where
growing national wealth has pushed auto sales to record highs.
 But the once-simmering market is returning to a more rational
growth pattern of 10-15 percent this year after the government
scrapped most of its auto incentives at the end of 2010.
 The Beijing city government's recent move to impose quotas on
new car registrations and possibly similar moves by other big
cities to tackle traffic gridlock will also apply the brakes on
sales.
 Still, GM, which sold 2.35 million vehicles in China in 2010
and always aims to outpace the market, remains under tremendous
capacity pressure this year, Johnsson told Reuters in a telephone
interview.
 ""We sold everything we could build in 2010 and the same holds
true in 2011. We could actually sell more than we will be able to
(build) if we are not capacity constrained. We are actually short
of capacity,"" he said.
 ""The total business is going to go up by the size of a single
plant. It's not just about this year. We'll have to look about a
real rapid increase in our capacity.""
 Ford Motor, Nissan Motor and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz among
others are also ramping up capacity in China, banking on robust
demand in the smaller inland cities, which are replacing big
urban centers as the major industry growth driver as incomes
rise.
 Even the super luxury brand Porsche is adding 10 dealerships
to its 31 shops in mainland China this year to cater to demand in
mid-tier cities, its China chief, Helmut Broeker, was quoted as
saying by Automotive News.
 GM, which also makes light commercial vehicles in China with
FAW Group, sold roughly 20 percent more vehicles in the country
in January than a year earlier, mostly due to its passenger car
business, Johnsson said.
 The automaker will release its official monthly China car
sales data on Feb 9.
 SURGE IN CHEVY SAIL EXPORTS
 In January 2010, GM rolled out the Chevrolet Sail, jointly
developed with its partner and domestic industry champion SAIC
Motor Corp in China.
 The first foreign brand with a price tag below 60,000 yuan
mark ($9,100) became an instant hit in the small car segment,
collecting an annual tally of 125,625 units, roughly 12 percent
of GM's overall passenger car sales in the country that year.
 Perceiving a demand for quality and affordable small cars in
other emerging markets, GM exported 5,000 of the Sail models from
China in the first 10 months of last year, mostly to Chile. The
volume is estimated to jump to 20,000 units or more this year,
Johnsson said..
 ""It's a strategic decision to take advantage of a vehicle
that's hot right now and establish out channels in those markets.
If we don't feed that demand in those market places, maybe these
markets will look elsewhere,"" he said.
 So far, GM has only exported fully assembled Sail cars from
China. It plans to start shipping components and have them
assembled in select markets in South America this year and later
in other developing countries, he added.
 ""We have a pretty ambitious plan on the exports side. It's
far beyond the numbers that we are looking at this year,""
Johnsson said.
 ""We certainly would look ahead to a time we will be looking
to exporting quite substantial amount of business from China.""

unemployment and household debt weigh on domestic demand.	
 ""Without jobs and income security, there can be no rebound
in domestic demand - and ultimately, no sustainable recovery.""	
 Emerging markets will grow at a faster pace of 6.5 percent,
with Asia excluding Japan expanding by 8.5 percent.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The euro crept back near a
two-month high on Tuesday after a jump in euro zone inflation
fuelled expectations of a rate hike and as worries about unrest
in Egypt abated slightly.
 Analysts said the euro could add to its gains in the
near-term, especially if European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet talks tough on inflation after the ECB's
policy meeting on Thursday.
 A key will be whether the euro manages to break
above last week's two-month high of $1.3760, said Andrew
Robinson, FX market strategist at Saxo Bank in Singapore.
 ""I think if we break there, then we have every chance to
squeeze up to maybe the $1.39 to $1.3950 level, which is the
next Fibonacci level for that latest down move,"" he said.
 The 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's November to
January slide lies right around $1.3950.
 Some market players say the euro could even rise towards
$1.40 in the weeks ahead, provided the trouble in Egypt does not
spread to other countries.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent from late U.S. trading on Monday
to $1.3722 .
 The euro edged higher after data on Monday showed
that consumer prices in the euro zone rose 2.4 percent
year-on-year, holding above the European Central Bank's target
of just below 2 percent for the second month.
 The data helped lift the three-month Euribor rate
, the benchmark short-term interest rate for
European money markets, to 1.074 percent, its highest since July
2009. [ID:nEAP000437]
 The euro's yield advantage over the dollar -- as measured by
the difference between two-year German and U.S. bond yields --
has also widened over the past month, and is now hovering near a
two-year high touched last week.  .
 Easing worries about the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis and growing expectations that the ECB could hike rates
sooner than the U.S. Federal Reserve have supported the euro in
recent weeks. [ID:nBRLVCE7AU]
 WILL EURO REBOUND LAST?
 There were doubts, however, about how long the euro's rally
may last.
 Gareth Berry, G10 FX strategist for UBS in Singapore, said
worries about the debt crisis could come back to haunt the euro,
adding that the UBS forecast was for the euro to be trading at
$1.25 at the end of April.
 In addition, current market expectations about the possible
pace of ECB rate rises seem excessive, Berry said.
 Overnight index swaps are now implying that market players
expect the ECB to raise interest rates by roughly 75 basis
points in the next 12 months, exceeding the pace of tightening
they expect from central banks in Australia and New Zealand, he
said.
 ""I think it's very likely that Trichet is going to sound
more hawkish. But there's a big difference between sounding
hawkish and actually delivering a rate hike,"" Berry added.
 Sterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.6051 , supported by
market expectations that British interest rates may rise as
early as the first half of the year.
 Sterling hit a 10-week high of $1.6073 earlier on Tuesday,
having extended its gains after surging 1 percent on Monday.
 The Australian dollar held firm after the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) ended its monthly policy meeting with a
generally upbeat assessment of the domestic and global economy.
 The RBA kept its key cash rate unchanged at 4.75 percent,
saying the impact of flood damage in Queensland would be
temporary and it was still very much focused on the medium-term
outlook for solid growth. [ID:nL3E7CV25J] [ID:nL3E7CV06C]
 The Australian dollar extended its gains after triggering
stop-loss bids and last stood at $1.0025 , up 0.5
percent on the day.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 81.83 yen , having
touched a one-month low of 81.75 yen earlier on Tuesday.

 By Wayne Cole	
 SYDNEY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept its
key cash rate unchanged at 4.75 percent on Tuesday saying the
impact of flood damage in Queensland would be temporary and it
was still very much focused on the medium-term outlook for solid
growth.	
The Australian dollar (AUD=D4) held firm atop parity after
the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its monthly policy
meeting with a generally upbeat assessment of the domestic and
global economy.	
 The central bank has led the developed world in hiking 175
basis points since late 2009, a pre-emptive policy that helped
slow underlying inflation to a decade-low last quarter.	
 ""The medium-term story still seems to remain intact, with a
positive boost from commodities, the Asia story, and some of the
inflation risks that go with that,"" said Michael Blythe, chief
economist at Commonwealth Bank.	
 ""As the RBA points out it's the medium-term projection that
will drive the interest rate story over time and while floods
and the like may affect the near-term timing, they probably
don't affect the end point for rates -- it still seems to be a
tightening bias in place.""

 http://link.reuters.com/geq77r 
 For a poll on the outlook for rates see 
 For a TAKE A LOOK on Australian floods 
 
 An unchanged decision was always likely given the RBA had
lifted rates as recently as November and the temporary economic
drag from floods in Queensland was just another reason to pause.	
 A survey out on Tuesday showed how the flooding had slugged
business confidence to a two-year low, even as sales, profits
and employment all picked up outside the stricken state.	
 Indeed, with a huge cyclone charging towards Queensland's
coast and threatening to do more damage to exports and tourism,
the weather was shaping up to be a real headache this quarter.	
 Since the flooding first hit, financial markets have all but
priced out any chance of a rate increase this side of June and
only one rise to 5.0 percent by year-end <0#YIB:>.	
 Analysts are generally more hawkish, with most surveyed in a
Reuters poll seeing a hike some time in the second quarter and
rates up at 5.25 percent by the end of the year .	
 
 RIDING THE COMMODITY BOOM	
 The RBA will offer a much more detailed economic assessment
in its quarterly statement of monetary policy on Friday, a
60-odd page roundup of the domestic and global outlook.	
 It should lower its near-term inflation forecasts to reflect
a surprisingly benign reading on consumer prices last quarter,
and perhaps trim its growth estimate for the first half of the
year to account of the impact of the floods.	
 However, spending on rebuilding in Queensland could bolster
growth later in the year and recent stronger data across the
globe bodes well for Australia's resource exports.	
 Indeed, prices for its biggest exports, iron ore and coal,
have outstripped all expectations in the last couple of months
courtesy of insatiable demand from Chinese steelmakers.	
 As a result, Australia's terms of trade have climbed back to
their highest since the 1950s, a surprise for the RBA which had
been expecting a steady decline this year.	
 The central bank has estimated that the lofty level of the
terms of trade is worth a staggering 12 to 15 percent of
Australia's A$1.3 trillion in gross domestic product (GDP) every
year it lasts.	
 That A$150 billion to A$200 billion in extra income finds it
way into profits, wages, employment and tax receipts and is
funding a record expansion in mining investment which should
last for years to come.	
 With unemployment already down at 5 percent and not far from
lows that have fuelled price pressures in the past, all this
extra cash makes for an inflationary brew.	
 ""For the RBA, the key themes remain strong global growth,
historically high terms of trade and booming business
investment,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist at RBC Capital
Markets.	
 ""A low starting point for inflation means they have some
flexibility to pause for now, but whichever way you cut it the
next move for rates is up.""

 By Ron Popeski	
 SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks posted modest
gains on Tuesday, led by shares in resource companies, as strong
U.S. factory data and surging commodities prices offset fears
that unrest in Egypt could spread elsewhere in the Middle East.	
 Brent crude oil futures steadied after topping $100

concerns of a global fuel price spike even as policymakers in
many emerging economies struggle to contain soaring food prices.	
 Data released in China showed manufacturing input prices
were rising quickly, keeping pressure on the government to
tackle inflation.	
 Figures from South Korea showed consumer inflation in
January rose more than expected at the upper end of the central
bank's target. Inflation in Indonesia was also higher than
targeted, triggering pressure for rate rises, while in Thailand
the rate dipped from December but the outlook for further policy
rate rises remained unchanged.	
 The euro inched back up near a two-month high after a
jump in euro zone inflation fuelled expectations of an interest
rate increase and as worries about Egyptian unrest abated
slightly. The common currency stood at $1.3720.	
 Analysts said the euro could rise further, especially if
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet talks tough
on inflation after a Thursday policy meeting.	
 Japan's Nikkei share index and the MSCI index of
Asian shares outside of Japan rose 0.16 percent
and 0.23 percent respectively, with shares of energy and
resource companies outperforming.	
 Relief that turmoil in Egypt was not escalating helped
provide a floor for the market.	
 ""Investors are finally able to focus on corporate earnings
and some stocks are set to benefit from expectations for their
results and forecasts,"" said Masumi Yamamoto of Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets.	
 Sentiment was supported by U.S. data showing factory
activity in the Midwest hit a 22-1/2 year high in January as
orders surged and employment prospects brightened, providing
further signs that the economy would stay on a solid growth path
this year. 
 Strong earnings reports and boosted mergers and acquisitions
activity also prompted investors to take a more sanguine view of
events in Egypt and renew purchases of riskier assets. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.68
percent overnight, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index
gained 0.87 percent.	
 Brent crude hovered just above $100 after soaring as high as
$101.73 overnight, while U.S. crude futures steadied above $92.	
 Saudi Arabia said OPEC was concerned by unrest in Egypt,
where protesters seeking the removal of President Hosni Mubarak
planned a ""million-strong"" march on Tuesday, but saw no need for
an immediate boost in output as there was no oil shortage.

 Stock markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong were
little changed with investors reluctant to stake out fresh
positions ahead of long Lunar New Year holidays later this week.	
 China's official purchasing managers' index fell in January
to its lowest level in five months. Though activity continued to
expand, input prices rose quickly, keeping pressure on Beijing
to tighten policy to contain inflationary pressures.

 ""This indicates that the economic recovery trend is not yet
clear, and we may see economic growth slow down a bit,"" Zhang
Liqun, a government researcher, said in a statement accompanying
the release. 
 The data signalled that demand for oil may not rise as
quickly in China, the world's second largest oil user.	
 In Korea, the finance ministry said consumer inflation was
expected to hover at the 4 percent range in the current quarter
before softening to 3 percent in the second half. The index rose
4.1 percent in January, above a 3.9 percent forecast in a
Reuters poll.	
 Indonesia's annual inflation picked up in January to a
21-month high of 7.02 percent, above the central bank's end-2011
target range of 4-6 percent. Some economists brought forward
their expectations for a central bank rate hike to this Friday.	
 Annual core inflation in Thailand slipped to 1.3 percent
from 1.4 percent in December, while headline inflation was stuck
at around 3.0 percent. Economists said food price inflation was
less marked than in other countries, but authorities had to keep
close watch on rises in oil and raw materials.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The euro crept back near a two-month
high on Tuesday after a jump in euro zone inflation fuelled
expectations of a rate hike and as worries about unrest in Egypt
abated slightly.
 Surprisingly strong data on factory activity in the U.S.
Midwest may also have boosted investor risk appetite, although
traders said the market could remain volatile given that
uncertainty remains in the Middle East.
 The data fanned hopes that more important economic numbers
due later this week, such as the manufacturing survey later on
Tuesday and Friday's payroll data, could solidify hopes for a
stronger recovery.
 ""I think the market is now generally hoping that payroll data
will be pretty strong,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3740 on trading
platform EBS on Monday, a whisker from last week's two-month peak
of $1.3760. It last traded at $1.3718, up 0.2 percent on the day.
 Some said the euro could renew a march towards $1.40 in the
weeks ahead, provided the trouble in Egypt does not spread to
other countries.
 The euro also kept the gains it made on Monday against the
Swiss franc, fetching 1.2930 franc, compared to a two-week low of
1.2780 franc hit earlier on Monday.
 Consumer prices in the 17 countries using the euro rose 2.4
percent year-on-year, holding above the ECB's target of just
below 2 percent for the second month.
 The data helped lift the three-month Euribor rate to 1.074
percent, its highest since July 2009.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet has
already warned about price pressures and is to speak on Thursday
after the ECB's monthly meeting.
 Easing worries about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis
and growing expectations that the ECB could hike rates sooner
than the Federal Reserve have supported the euro in recent
weeks.
 Reports over the weekend that the European Union was
working on a solution to reduce Greece's debt burden also
helped boost the euro, traders said.
 The single currency's rebound has also helped the British
pound, which has additionally been boosted by expectations of a
rate hike by the Bank of England.
 BoE policymaker Martin Weale, who surprised the market by
voting for a rate hike last month, said that a small rise in
interest rates would now cost less in the long run than higher
ingrained inflation.
 Sterling rose 0.3 percent on Tuesday, extending its 1 percent
gains on Monday, to hit a 10-week high of $1.6073 The dollar
was moving little against the Japanese yen, trading at 82.08 yen,
off a four-week low of 81.77 yen marked on Monday.
 The index of the dollar against a basket of major currencies
slid to 77.603, near an 11-week low of 77.537 touched on Monday.
 As risk appetite came back, the Australian dollar was firm at
$0.9967, keeping the 0.3 percent gain it made on Monday, ahead of
the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy statement expected at
around 0330 GMT.
 Australia's central bank is certain to leave interest rates
unchanged and to maintain a wait-and-see stance as policymakers
assess the full economic impact of devastating floods in
Queensland.
 ""The market will be interested to know how the RBA assesses
the impact of the flood,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The euro headed for its second
consecutive monthly advance against the dollar on Monday and
more gains could be in store after a jump in euro zone
inflation bolstered the view interest rates in the region could
rise more quickly than in the United States.
 That helped the euro reverse losses suffered on Friday as
unrest in Egypt drove up oil prices and sparked a safe-haven
bid for dollars and Swiss francs.
 Asian central banks and some Middle East accounts were
among the most active euro buyers, traders said. Some said the
euro could renew a march toward $1.40 in the weeks ahead,
provided trouble in Egypt does not spread to other countries.
 Brad Bechtel, managing director at FX execution firm Faros
Trading in Stamford, Connecticut, said inflation expectations
and month-end buying could drive the euro to $1.3750. He added
that ""$1.40 is still on the cards"" if Egypt tensions die down.
 While protesters filled the streets of Cairo for a seventh
straight day, investors seemed to take heart that violence and
disorder had at least not worsened.
 ""The Egypt crisis is looking increasingly like a tempest in
a teacup from a global investor perspective, with developments
over the weekend insufficient to maintain the safe-haven bid
seen late last week,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3740 on trading platform EBS
and was last up 0.6 percent at $1.3692. Support is seen at
$1.3570, the 50 percent retracement of its November-to-January
decline. It was on pace to post a gain of 2.3 percent in
January, which follows a gain of 3.1 percent in December.
 Sterling jumped 1 percent to $1.6012, boosted by euro gains
in a reverse of Friday's losses.
 The euro also rose against the Swiss franc and yen. The
dollar was down 0.1 percent at 82.05 yen.
 Reports over the weekend that the European Union was
working on a solution to reduce Greece's debt burden also
helped boost the euro, traders said.
 INFLATION, SOVEREIGN STRESS
 Consumer prices in the 17 countries using the euro rose 2.4
percent year-on-year, holding above the ECB's target of just
below 2 percent for the second month. European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet has already warned about price
pressures and is to speak Thursday after the ECB's monthly
meeting.
 Easing worries about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis
and growing expectations that the ECB could hike rates sooner
than the Federal Reserve have supported the euro in recent
weeks.
 The three-month Euribor rate, a mix of interest rate
expectations and banks' lending appetite, rose to 1.074
percent, the highest since July 2009.
 Citing a high U.S. jobless rate, the Fed has made it clear
it is not close to raising interest rates from near zero, even
as U.S. economic data has shown signs of improvement.
 Despite the euro's recent recovery, Aroop Chatterjee,
currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York, cautioned
that a lot of good news has already been priced in.
 ""We see disappointment on the euro sovereign debt issue as
significant differences remain between the euro area
policymakers,"" he said. ""We see conditions likely pushing those
countries to either getting a bailout from the EU/IMF as in the
case of Portugal, or the potential for a credit line being
extended by the IMF as in the case of Spain.""
 Chatterjee forecasts the euro will decline to about $1.30
by March and trade around $1.34 in three months, before
rebounding to $1.42 over a year as the U.S. dollar is pressured
by worries about U.S. fiscal challenges.

 * Both Airbus and Boeing received unfair subsidies
(Adds Boeing comment, edits)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Plane maker Boeing received
unfair subsidies from the U.S. government, according to a World
Trade Organization report on Monday, and Boeing and its European
rival Airbus immediately quarrelled over the scale of the
support.
 European rival Airbus said the report showed Boeing had
received at least $5 billion in illegal subsidies and was only
able to launch its 787 Dreamliner with such support. Boeing
denied the assertions.
 The United States and European Union, both trading
superpowers, have been fighting cases against each other in the
WTO for more than six years over each other's subsidies for
large passenger aircraft.
 Monday's report by WTO experts marked the latest stage in
the dispute as Airbus and Boeing battle for the $1.7 trillion
market.
 The report is still confidential, but even Boeing
acknowledges that the WTO has backed some of the EU claims.
However the two sides disagreed strongly over the amount of
condemned Boeing subsidies and how they compared with those
given to Airbus.
 The findings in the related cases could colour a decision in
the coming weeks by the U.S. Air Force on whether to award
Boeing or Airbus parent EADS a $25-50 billion contract for
refuelling tankers.
 Both have supporters in the U.S. Congress, as Boeing would
build and finish the tanker in Washington state and Kansas while
Airbus would assemble it in Alabama.
 
 NEED FOR AGREEMENT
 With no end to the litigation in sight, both sides have
periodically called for a negotiated end to the dispute, as EU
Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht did in September when an
interim version of the report was issued..
 His spokesman said on Monday the report confirmed those
initial findings, in comments suggesting Brussels was not keen
to raise the stakes, or wanted to play down a previous WTO
ruling that condemned its own support for Airbus.
 ""This solid report sheds further light on the negative
consequences for the EU industry of these U.S. subsidies and
provides a timely element of balance in this long-running
dispute,"" spokesman John Clancy said in a statement.
 One EU diplomat said a political solution was preferable.
 ""Given the state of the global airline industry today, a
political agreement is important for both sides of the
Atlantic,"" the diplomat said.
 The ruling, like the interim report, was handed only to the
parties. It will not be published for several weeks while being
translated into French and Spanish.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk's office said it could
not provide detailed comment now as the report was confidential.
 ""Despite that the EU has publicly commented on the report,
at this time we will simply say that the United States is
confident that the WTO will confirm the U.S. view that European
subsidies to Airbus dwarf any subsidies that the United States
provided to Boeing,"" spokeswoman Nefeterius McPherson said.
 
 MASSIVE SUBSIDIES
 Airbus said the report would show Boeing had received
billions of dollars in illegal subsidies, depriving Airbus of
$45 billion in sales, an indication of what the EU could seek in
sanctions if the case moved to retaliation.
 But Boeing disputed Airbus's figures and said the ruling
would not require any change in policy or practice as far as
Boeing was concerned.
 WTO experts found last year that Airbus received illegal
export subsidies from European governments and both sides have
appealed against that ruling.
 Appeals involving prohibited export subsidies are supposed
to be dealt with in 60 days under WTO rules, but this case is so
complicated that the WTO's appellate body has said it will not
come to a conclusion until some time this year.
 Boeing says the research and development grants it received
pale into insignificance beside the support for Airbus.
 In the Airbus case, WTO judges found the company had been
able to launch a series of passenger aircraft only thanks to the
government support and called for an end to export subsidies.
 Both sides have an interest in clarifying the rules for how
governments can facilitate the development of new aircraft in a
fair manner.
 It could take until much later this year for the appeals
process in both cases to run its course, but the two
governments, aware that Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan and
Russia have en eye on the market, are eventually likely to
negotiate a settlement.

 By Sean Mattson and Silvio Cascione
 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Latin American
currencies firmed on Monday and Chile's peso hit a nearly
one-month high, helped by solid U.S. consumer spending and
factory data that offset lingering fears about unrest in
Egypt.
 Monday's gains helped the Mexican peso cut some of its
steep losses on Friday, when violent protests in Egypt rattled
global financial markets. For details, see [ID:nLDE70O2DA]
 ""The market reacted very violently on Friday ... but the
panic that was set off in emerging currencies and some emerging
bonds was, for me, exaggerated,"" said Ramon Cordova, a currency
trader at Base Internacional.
 Data on Monday showed a measure of factory activity in the
U.S. Midwest rose to a 22-1/2 year high in January while
consumer spending ended 2010 on a firmer footing.
[ID:nN31151915]
 The United States is a major trading partner with Latin
America and it is the top buyer of Mexico's exports.
 Mexico's peso   firmed 0.54 percent to 12.1460
per dollar while the Chilean peso  gained 0.25 percent
to 483 per dollar.
 The U.S. data helped push the price of copper, Chile's main
export, toward a record high.
 Chile's peso has recovered more than half of a 7 percent
drop that followed the central bank's introduction of a $12
billion currency intervention program earlier in January.
 Expectations that further intervention surprises are
unlikely and bets that the central bank will resume hiking
interest rates in February are boosting demand for the Chilean
currency. [ID:nN31202514]
 Brazil's currency strengthened as traders sought to boost
the value of their month-end positions in the foreign exchange
market amid concerns that the central bank could raise
borrowing costs more than expected.
 Investors stepped up their purchases of the Brazilian real
 to lift the value of their bets on a declining U.S.
dollar, traders said. The move comes ahead of Monday's
settlement of the benchmark rate index PTax that is used to
calculate the value of those positions.
 Adding to the real's strength, a central bank weekly survey
showed that year-end forecasts for the Selic  --
the central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate -- were
raised to 12.50 percent from 12.25 percent. Higher rates often
lure foreign money, creating a glut of dollars in the domestic
market that bolsters the real.
 The real  bid 0.71 percent firmer at 1.671 per
dollar.
 Those gains could force the authorities to take even more
aggressive action in the market to curb the currency's rise and
protect exporters and local manufacturers.
 ""As the exchange rate approaches the threshold of 1.65 (per
dollar), new measures should be announced,"" said Luciano
Rostagno, chief strategist at CM Capital Markets.
 The central bank will buy dollar forwards via three
separate auctions on Monday, the latest in a series of steps to
weaken the real from current levels. [ID:nN28245256]
 It also called two auctions to buy dollars on the spot
market as part of an effort to curb the currency's recent
rally. The central bank has recently resumed holding two daily
spot auctions.
 The events in Egypt had a more significant impact on
Brazil's real on Friday than earlier attempts by the central
bank to tame the currency's gains.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Monday's
strong earnings while Europe's oil benchmark hit $100 a barrel
on concerns about the possible spread of unrest in Egypt which
caused a sharp selloff in world equities last week.
 The euro also recovered from Friday's weakness, helped by
concerns economic growth and inflation in Europe might mean the
region increases interest rates more quickly than the United
States.
 U.S. government debt prices slipped back as investors
turned to riskier assets while Europe's benchmark Brent crude
oil surged above $100 a barrel for the first time in 28 months
on concerns that the political upheaval in Egypt could spread
through to other parts of the Middle East, possibly disrupting
oil shipments through the Suez Canal.
 Gold edged up on some safe-haven buying but it was set for
its worst monthly performance since December 2009, driven down
by the improving tone of some key U.S. economic data.
 A report showed a measure of factory activity in the U.S.
Midwest rising to a 22-1/2 year high in January on strong
orders and employment prospects. Another showed consumer
spending ended 2010 on a firmer footing, a trend that
economists expected to continue as the labor market recovery
gains traction. [ID:nN31151915]
 European shares edged up from three-week lows, with energy
and mining firms advancing as confidence over the outlook for
corporate profits overshadowed worries about political unrest
in Egypt.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index ended 0.1
percent higher at 1,145.06 points.
 ""I think it would take more than protests in Egypt to take
this market down. The earnings continue to come in
better-than-expected but I am looking for a correction,"" said
Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James in
St. Petersburg, Florida.
 U.S. stocks edged higher after Exxon Mobil Corp ,
the world's largest publicly traded oil company reported a
higher-than-expected 53 percent increase in quarterly profit.
[ID:nN30169616]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 52.30
points, or 0.44 percent, at 11,876.00. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 9.59 points, or 0.75 percent, at
1,285.93.
 The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 16.29 points, or
0.61 percent, at 2,703.18, managing to hold gains even after
bellwether Intel Corp  fell 1.7 percent to $21.09 after
cutting its first-quarter revenue forecast by $300 million due
to costs for correcting a design flaw in one of its chips. For
details, see [ID:nN31219961]
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.18
percent while emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.58 percent,
pressured by Egypt's unrest.
 In currencies, the euro was supported by purchases made by
Asian central banks and Middle East accounts, while nervousness
surrounding the political crisis in Egypt is calming down ""as
far as the currency market is concerned,"" said Brad Bechtel,
managing director of Faros Trading, managing director at FX
advisory and execution firm Faros Trading in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 The dollar was down against a basket of currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.57 percent at 77.689, while
the euro  was up 0.69 percent at $1.3707, and some
traders expecting a move toward $1.40 in the weeks ahead.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.17
percent at 81.97.
 Egypt's stock exchange was closed on Monday as a result of
the protests to end the 30-year rule of President Hosni
Mubarak. Ratings agency Moody's added to Cairo's financial woes
by downgrading the country's debt rating on concern the Mubarak
regime may spend more to placate protesters.
 Among commodities, benchmark Brent crude  hit $101 a
barrel, first time since September 2008, while benchmark U.S.
crude  futures were up 1.67 percent at $90.83 a barrel on

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2011 12:40PM ET</span>",TIMELINE-Key dates in Airbus-Boeing subsidy dispute," Jan 31 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation delivered a
final ruling on Monday on whether Boeing benefited from unfair
U.S. subsidies to develop airliners in competition with Europe's
Airbus.
 The confidential ruling was delivered to the parties and
will not be published for several weeks or months.
 Meanwhile, the WTO's appellate body is reviewing an appeal
by the EU and U.S. into a ruling in a related case that Airbus
benefited from illegal EU subsidies.
 Here is a timeline of the dispute between Airbus and Boeing.

 Oct. 2004 - Washington files a case challenging European
loans to help Airbus develop aircraft and terminates a 1992
civil aircraft agreement covering government support for the two
top aircraft manufacturers. 
 -- The EU files a counter-complaint against U.S. support for
Boeing. 
 Dec. 2004 - Airbus wins shareholder approval to start
seeking orders for a fuel-saving, wide-body plane to be called
the A350, unleashing a fresh marketing battle against Boeing. 
 -- Airbus says it is entitled to apply for a third of the
A350 development cost under a 1992 European Union-United States
trade deal, but Boeing maintains that deal is dead. 
 March 2005 - The United States and Europe trade accusations
in an escalation of the dispute over subsidies.
 -- Washington wants Europe to stop providing ""launch aid""
loans to Airbus, worth about $15 billion since 1967. Brussels
argues Boeing benefits from its own form of aid, such as
Washington state tax breaks and federal government contracts.
 May 2005 - The United States reactivates its WTO case
against European subsidies for Airbus after fresh efforts to
reach a negotiated settlement with Brussels fail. The EU says
the next day it will reactivate its legal case against U.S.
support for aircraft maker Boeing in a tit-for-tat riposte. 
 July 2005 - The WTO launches twin probes into state aid for
Boeing and Airbus in what is billed as the biggest trade
dogfight ever but both Washington and Brussels reaffirm they are
still ready to negotiate a deal. 
 Aug. 2005 - The U.S. administration urges Britain not to
pledge government support to Airbus. 
 Sept. 2005 - Airbus Chief Executive Gustav Humbert says he
is confident European governments will lend the plane maker
almost 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to develop its A350. 
 July 2006 - Airbus unveils a $10 billion revamp of its
planned A350 aircraft and says it will seek government aid from
its partner countries, Britain, France, Germany and Spain.
 June 15, 2009 - Airbus takes a step closer to winning
government loans as Britain, France, Germany and Spain say they
aim to decide by the end of June how much money they are
prepared to put up to help the A350 project. 
 -- Germany is prepared to provide 1.1 billion euros ($1.5
billion) and France will contribute 1.4 billion. 
 -- Boeing says government financing would violate WTO rules.
 Aug. 14, 2009 - Britain pledges 340 million pounds ($510
million) in loans. 
 Aug 27, 2009 - Boeing says it hopes the preliminary WTO
panel ruling will force European governments to reconsider plans
to help finance the Airbus A350. 
 Sept. 4, 2010 - WTO panel issues interim ruling in U.S. case
against Airbus to the parties. Various sources say the panel
found EU aid amounted to unfair subsidies and in some cases
violated a tougher ban on export subsidies, but rejected some
U.S. complaints.
 March 8, 2010 - Northrop Grumman, which was bidding for a
$50 billion U.S. refuelling aircraft contract with EADS,
withdraws from the tanker contest leaving the field open to
Boeing, and prompting complaints of U.S. protectionism by EU
leaders.
 March 22, 2010 - Germany confirms it is ready to provide 1.1
billion euros' worth of funding to Airbus for the A350.
 March 23, 2010 - Confidential WTO report into European
subsidies for Airbus tells EU to end illegal export subsidies.
 June 30, 2010 - WTO report into Airbus is published. Panel
condemns illegal export subsidies and said Airbus relied on
subsidies to develop passenger aircraft.
 July 21, 2010 - EU appeals against ruling in Airbus case.
 Aug 19, 2010 - United States appeals against ruling in
Airbus case.
 Sept 16, 2010 - WTO hands confidential interim report on
subsidies for Boeing to United States and EU. Both sides express
satisfaction at the ruling.
 Sept 22, 2010 - WTO appeal court says it will not rule on
appeal over Airbus ruling until 2011.
 Jan 17, 2011 - Airbus receives more orders than Boeing in
2010 for the third year running.
 Jan 27, 2011 - U.S. Air Force says both Boeing and EADS
dealt correctly with a USAF mix-up, in which the rivals received
data on each other's bids, in their pitch for a $25-50 billion
refuelling tanker contract. The USAF is due to award the
contract in the coming weeks or months.
 Jan. 31, 2011 - WTO delivers its report to participants in
the transatlantic row over airline subsidies.

"
1053,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2011 12:36PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Main conclusions of WTO panel on Airbus aid," Jan 31 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization handed a
report to the United States and European Union on Monday which
found that U.S. plane maker Boeing received unfair subsidies
from the U.S. government for large passenger aircraft.
 The confidential report will not be published for several
weeks or months.
 Following are the main conclusions of another WTO panel that
ruled in a related complaint brought by the United States
against the European Union over aid for Airbus civil aircraft.
 The report, of more than 1,000 pages, was published on June
30 last year after being issued confidentially to the United
States and the EU on March 23. The panel, which was chaired by
Uruguay's former ambassador to the WTO, Carlos Perez de
Castillo, was formed in 2005.
 Both the EU and the United States have appealed against the
findings of that report.
 The United States had complained that the development and
marketing of Airbus airliners was only possible thanks to a
programme of ""launch aid"" and other financial support by the EU
and some of its member states on non-commercial terms.
 It said this aid comprised illegal subsidies, which hurt the
U.S. civil aircraft industry by depriving it of market share.
 
 ""LAUNCH AID""
 * The panel agreed that support for the Airbus A300, A310,
A320, A330, A340, A380 airliners constituted launch aid.
 * It did not agree that support for the A350 was launch aid,
as it did not examine the A350 programme, launched after the
complaint was filed.
 * It found that the United States had not proved there was a
coherent, systematic launch aid programme.
 
 SUBSIDIES
 * The panel found that German, British and Spanish funding
for the A380 airliner amounted to de facto export subsidies.
 * It disagreed that French aid for the A330, A340 and A380
and Spanish aid for the A340 were export subsidies.
 * It did not agree that the export subsidies were legal --
i.e. that funding was formally conditional on achieving exports.
 * It disagreed that loans by the European Investment Bank
(EIB) to the Airbus programme amounted to specific subsidies
under WTO rules.
 * It found that some but not all infrastructure spending by
member states was a specific subsidy to Airbus.
 * It found that the transfer of the German government's 20
percent stake in Deutsche Airbus to KfW, a state-owned bank, and
then to MBB, subsequently acquired by Daimler, was a specific
subsidy. In particular, KfW's sale of the stake in 1992 to MBB
was below market rates.
 * It disagreed that debt forgiveness by the German
government was a specific subsidy.
 * It agreed that equity infusions by the French government
and Credit Lyonnais were specific subsidies.
 * It agreed that the 1998 transfer of the French state's 46
percent state in Dassault Aviation to Aerospatiale was a
specific subsidy.
 * It agreed that some but not all research and development
spending on the Airbus programme was a specific subsidy. (The
panel estimated the total value of R&D spending at about 750
million euros, against a U.S. claim of 2 billion euros and an EU
estimate of 381 million euros.)
 
 MARKET IMPACT
 * The panel found that Boeing's share of sales of large
civil aircraft to the EU market declined while Airbus's
increased over the period under review (2001-2006)
 * It found that Boeing imports to the EU were displaced by
Airbus.
 * It found that Airbus displaced Boeing sales in Australia,
China, and India, and to a lesser extent in Brazil, Mexico,
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
 * It found that the United States did not prove that Airbus
had undercut prices.
 * It agreed the Airbus progrmame had led to the suppression
or depression of prices for Boeing 737, 767 and 747 airliners
but not the Boeing 777. (Suppression is when prices are
prevented from rising, depression when they are pushed down.)
 * It agreed with the United States that launch aid shifted
the risk of launching aircraft to the government from the
manufacturer through non-commercial funding.
 * It agreed with the U.S. that Airbus's ability to launch
each model was dependent on subsidies.
 * It agreed that Airbus could not have marketed planes when
it did without specific subsidies from the EU, Britain France,
Germany and Spain.
 * It concluded that if Airbus had launched and marketed the
planes without subsidies it would have been a much different and
weaker company.
 * It found that without subsidies Airbus would not have had
the market share it did in 2001-2006.
 * It found that without the Airbus subsidies, the U.S. would
have had a bigger share in EU and third markets.
 * It found that Airbus's market share was a result of
subsidies.
 * It disagreed with the United States that the subsidies
allowed Airbus to price more aggressively (i.e. any suppression
or depression of prices was not caused by subsidies).
 
 IMPACT ON U.S. INDUSTRY
 * It agreed that the subsidies had displaced Boeing in EU
and third markets, causing ""serious prejudice"" to the United
States.
 * It disagreed that the subsidies led to price undercutting,
suppression or depression.
 * It found that Boeing recovered in 2005-2006 after
performing poorly in 2001-2003 so there was no material injury
to U.S. domestic industry.
 * It found that the EU had nullifed and impaired benefits to
the U.S. that the U.S. was entitled to under WTO agreements.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS
 * The panel recommended that prohibited export subsidies be
withdrawn ""without delay"" and said this meant within 90 days of
adoption of its report by the WTO.
 * It said the EU should remove the adverse effects of
subsidies or withdraw subsidies causing adverse effects.
 * It made no recommendations on how the EU should do this
(and the U.S. did not ask for recommendations)

 * Euro gains as euro zone inflation data tops estimates

 (Updates prices, adds comment, detail on U.S. data, Fed)
By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A jump in euro zone inflation
lifted the euro above $1.37 on Monday and bolstered the view
interest rates in the region could rise more quickly than in
the United States and other advanced economies.
 That helped the euro reverse the losses it suffered on
Friday as unrest in Egypt drove up oil prices and sparked a
safe-haven bid for dollars and Swiss francs.
 Asian central banks and some Middle East accounts were
among the most active euro buyers, traders said, and some said
the euro could renew a march toward $1.40 in the weeks ahead,
provided trouble in Egypt does not spread to other countries.
 Brad Bechtel, managing director at FX execution firm Faros
Trading in Stamford, Connecticut, said inflation expectations
and month-end buying could drive the euro to $1.3750, adding
""$1.40 is still on the cards"" if Egypt tensions die down.
 While protesters filled the streets of Cairo for a seventh
straight day, investors seemed to take heart that violence and
disorder had at least not worsened. [ID:nLDE70U00B]
 ""After Friday, people anticipated coming in to chaos and
anarchy in Egypt. When that didn't happen, a lot of shorts were
caught wrong-footed,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at GFT Forex.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3739  and was last up 0.6
percent at $1.3700. Overnight, $1.3570, the 50 percent
retracement of its November-to-January decline, acted as
support, bringimmng in buyers from Asia and the Middle East.
 Sterling jumped 1 percent to $1.6014 , lifted by euro
gains in a reverse of Friday's losses. The euro also rose
against the Swiss franc  and yen . The dollar
was down 0.2 percent at 81.96 yen .
 Weekend reports that the European Union was working on a
solution to reduce Greece's debt burden also helped boost the
euro, traders said. [ID:nLDE70U087]
 Schlossberg, however, said the potential for more unrest in
Egypt will make it ""a tough slog"" for the euro to break $1.40
or sterling to rise to $1.62 in the near term.
 Crude oil , reflecting uncertainty about events in
Egypt, swung between gains and losses in New York before
pushing above $90 per barrel in late morning. It was some 4
percent above Friday's low.
 INFLATION, EGYPT AND FED POLICY
 Data showing euro zone inflation rose 2.4 percent in the
year to January, above the European Central Bank's 2 percent
target, boosted the view the ECB could hike rates sooner than
the Federal Reserve.[ID:nBRLVCE7AU]. ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet has already warned about price pressures and is due to
speak Thursday after the ECB's monthly meeting.
 The three-month Euribor rate , a mix of
interest rate expectations and banks' lending appetite, rose to
1.074 percent, the highest since July 2009. [ID:nEAP000437].
 Citing a high U.S. jobless rate, the Fed has made it clear
it is not close to raising U.S. interest rates from near zero,
even as U.S. economic data has shown signs of improvement.
 Data Monday showed U.S. consumer spending rose for a sixth
straight month in December, while business activity in the
Midwest grew more than expected this month. [ID:nN31151915]
 The Commerce Department said Friday the economy grew 2.9
percent last year after shrinking by 2.6 percent in 2009.
 Some worry that the Fed is underestimating inflation, and
emerging market officials have said Fed policy and a weak
dollar have worsened inflation outside U.S. borders.
 Andrew Busch, global currency strategist at BMO Capital
Markets in Chicago, said higher food costs likely contributed
to the timing of unrest in Egypt and Tunisia.
 ""The potential risk is not over,"" he said. ""Food inflation
will continue to drive global instability. Watch to see if
foreign politicians and central bank governors begin to ramp up
their criticism of Fed monetary policy, which is perceived as a
cause of global inflation.""
 If trouble in Egypt spreads to other Arab countries ""and it
pushes up the oil price even more, then that would probably
spark more short-term flows into the dollar,"" said Karl Olsson,
currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.

 * Election could take place in May - aide
 * Uncertainty over successor the main political risk

(Edits, adds Nazarbayev's aide, analyst comment, background)
 By Raushan Nurshayeva
 ASTANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's veteran leader
called an early presidential election on Monday and rejected a
plan to rule for a third decade, pre-empting any unwelcome
parallels with authoritarian leaders in the Arab world.
 Kazakhstan, a major uranium and oil exporter, had earlier
suggested it might hold a referendum to allow President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, 70, to rule the country unopposed until
2020. The United States has strongly criticised that proposal.
 Speaking in an address broadcast on state television,
Nazarbayev -- in power since 1989 and known as ""Papa"" in his
vast steppe nation -- rejected the idea.
 ""I cannot create a precedent which would set the wrong
guidelines for further generations of politicians,"" he said. ""I
propose holding an early presidential election, despite the fact
that this will reduce my current term in office by almost two.""
 He made his remarks at a time when a wave of popular anger
is sweeping countries in North Africa and the Middle East. The
latest crisis in Egypt follows a revolt that toppled the leader
of Tunisia earlier this month.
 Like Egypt, Kazakhstan is a major regional economy led by a
long-serving strongman leader. Yet, it has no organised
opposition movement nor the political incentive to foment
Egypt-style street protests.
 Nazarbayev has ruled Central Asia's biggest economy since
before the Soviet collapse in 1991. Kazakhstan has never held an
election judged free and fair by international observes.
 Many foreign investors, who have poured more than $150
billion into Kazakhstan during Nazarbayev's rule, rate the
absence of a clear succession plan as the single biggest threat
to political stability.
 Analysts said Nazarbayev would not wish to risk alienation
by abandoning the next election as he seeks to diversify the
resource-dependent economy and attract a further $100 billion in
foreign investment over the next decade.
 ""To belong to the club of developed countries, Kazakhstan
needs to keep up the rules of the club and one of them is
respecting basic principles of democracy,"" said Lilit Gevorgyan,
an analyst at IHS Global Insight.
 ""To gain that membership, Kazakhstan should distance itself
from prevalent Central Asian regressive authoritarian regimes
and adopt more democratic practices, even if they are only on
paper.""
 In his address, Nazarbayev -- once a member of the Soviet
Communist Party's Politburo -- did not say when the next vote,
which he is almost certain to win, would be held. 
 His aide, Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, said it could take place
as early as May 2011. Parliament will meet on Feb. 2 and is
expected to set a date.
 SUCCESSION PLAN?
 Many in Kazakhstan credit Nazarbayev with annual economic
growth that has averaged around 8 percent over the last decade.
Per capita gross domestic product, at more than $9,000, is more
than 12 times what it was in 1994.
 People of Kazakhstan, including the business and political
elite, are more concerned with the succession. Nazarbayev may
spend part of his next term in office -- which will revert to
five years -- grooming a pliant successor, analysts said.
""Five more years will be quite enough for him to resolve the
main issue -- that of his successor -- because he is now racing
against time,"" said Kazakh political analyst Dosym Satpayev.
 Parliament had earlier voted unanimously in favour of the
plebiscite after a self-styled people's initiative presented
signatures late last year in support from more than half of
Kazakhstan's registered voters.
 By rejecting the initiative, Nazarbayev showed his resolve
to secure firm Western backing and extend diplomatic gains
achieved last year when Kazakhstan became the first former
Soviet country to chair the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
 Nazarbayev, as first president, can stand for election an
unlimited number of times. In his state-of-the-nation address on
Friday, he said he plans to rule for as long as his health and
his people will allow. [ID:nLDE70R0D8]

 * Treasury bond sale misses forecasts
 * Egypt unrest saps risk appetite
 
 (updates with closing prices)
 By Seda Sezer
 ISTANBUL, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Turkish benchmark bond yields
hit a five-month high on Monday and the lira weakened as Egypt's
political turmoil hammered appetite for riskier emerging markets
worldwide.
 The yield on Turkey's Nov. 7, 2012 bond rose to as high as
8.33 percent as two bond auctions met poor demand due to
investor nervousness before easing back to close at 8.19
percent.
 Turkey, a secular but majority Muslim democracy, has an
elected one-party government which has been in power since 2002,
and is seen as a beacon of stability, however its assets have
been hit by the Egyptian and other regional unrest.
 ""There might be some short-lived rebounds in stocks on
technical grounds, but the turmoil in Egypt will keep investors
from buying Turkish assets until things settle down,"" an
equities trader said.
 The lira closed at 1.6010 to the dollar on the interbank
market  from a close of 1.59 on Friday. Foreign sellers
were pushing the currency lower, traders said.
 Tuesday-dated trade for the busiest Nov. 7, 2012, bond
<0#TRTSYSUM=IS> showed yields inching up again to 8.22 percent.
 Turkey's Treasury sold a net 1.7 billion lira ($1.06
billion) worth of its Jan 29, 2014 fixed-coupon bond at a yield
of 9.14 percent, exceeding a forecast in a Reuters' poll of
bankers for 9.0 percent. 
 Sales of the fixed-coupon bond, including sales of 300.5
million lira to primary dealers in non-competitive bids, fell
just short of a poll forecast for 1.75 billion lira.
 The Treasury also sold a floating rate note (FRN), maturing
on Jan 24, 2018, at a price of 99.652 lira, below a poll
forecast of 100.420 lira. The FRN attracted sales of 2.38
billion, missing a forecast of 2.79 billion lira, as political
unrest in Egypt unsettled markets and sapped risk appetite.
 ""There weren't enough bids at the auctions and borrowing
costs were higher than expectations and higher than similar-
maturity bonds in the market. From this perspective we can say
that the auctions weren't successful,"" said Fatih Keresteci, a
strategist at HSBC Bank in Istanbul.
 ""We don't think the Treasury will have difficulty meeting
its borrowing target for this month, but it may push bond yields
higher whilst doing that,"" he added.
 The Turkish Treasury plans 13.5 billion lira borrowing in
February.
 
 BANK CONUNDRUM
 Bankers said for now low demand would continue to hit bond
prices but that if demand held up for two further auctions on
Tuesday that may ease pressure. 
 January inflation data due on Thursday may also help calm
markets concerned that a weaker lira has stoked faster price
appreciation, bankers said, particularly if it meets
expectations.
 The central bank has said annual inflation will be within
its year-end target of 5.5 percent in the first quarter.
 The lira and bond prices have fallen since the central
bank's rate cut on Jan 20, which in turn prompted a further
increase in banks' reserve requirements for lira deposits.
 The benchmark bond yield has risen steadily since hitting a
historic low of 6.87 percent on Jan. 6, after the central bank
reduced interest rates and raised banks' reserve requirements,
seen as moves designed to prevent the economy from overheating.
 The main Istanbul share index <.XU100> reversed early losses
to close slightly higher at at 63,278.07, slightly outperforming
the MSCI emerging equities index <.MSCIEF> which fell 0.7
percent.
 Analysts said stocks could bounce back a little on technical
grounds on Monday after steep losses on Friday.

 NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday on
strong earnings and merger activity, overshadowing concerns
about the possible spread of unrest in Egypt which had caused a
sharp selloff in world stocks on Friday
 The euro also recovered from Friday's weakness, helped by
concerns that economic growth and inflation in Europe might
result in interest rates rising in the region more quickly than
in the United States.
 Europe's benchmark Brent crude oil remained just short of
$100 a barrel, though U.S. government debt prices slipped back
as investors turned to riskier assets despite concerns that the
political upheaval in Egypt could spread through to other parts
of the Middle East.
 Gold extended losses after U.S. economic data showed
consumption beat expectations in December, while the Federal

weeks ahead. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was
down 0.11 percent at 82.01.
 Protests to end the 30-year rule of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak continued over the weekend, heightening risk
aversion for European investors already concerned by the effect
their own region's sovereign debt crisis and inflation could
have on growth.
 ""Traders are concerned that with already rising inflation
and falling real incomes for consumers, a further rise in
energy prices could really dampen any consumer confidence and

crude  futures were up 0.17 percent at $89.47.
 Spot gold prices  fell $4.74, or 0.36 percent, to
$1330.00 an ounce.
Treasuries softened after data showing consumer spending
rose by more than expected in December and that consumer
inflation was tame. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 was down 2/32, with the yield at 3.3372 percent.
The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 1/32, with
the yield at 0.5541 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond

 * Both Airbus and Boeing received unfair subsidies
(Attributes statement to spokesman on behalf of trade
commissioner, paragraphs 5-6)
 GENEVA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization
handed a report to U.S. and EU officials on Monday, which
industry sources said found that plane manufacturer Boeing
received billions of dollars in unfair subsidies from the U.S.
government.
 The report by WTO experts marked the latest stage in a
dispute between the United States and the European Union over
unfair and illegal support for each other's aircraft industry in
a market for large passenger aircraft worth more than $1.7
trillion.
 The WTO litigation has been in progress since 2004 and both
sides periodically call for negotiations to settle the dispute.
 The Boeing report is confidential and will not be published
for several weeks or months, but its European rival Airbus said
last week it would show the U.S. manufacturer had received
massive illegal subsidies.
 A spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht
welcomed the report's confirmation of initial findings issued in
September, also confidentially.
 ""This solid report sheds further light on the negative
consequences for the EU industry of these US subsidies and
provides a timely element of balance in this long-running
dispute,"" spokesman John Clancy said in a statement.
 WTO experts have already found that Airbus received illegal
subsidies from European governments and both sides have appealed
against that ruling, with the WTO's appellate body expected to
announce its findings later this year.
 Boeing says the research and development grants it received
pale into insignificance besides the support for Airbus, some of
which amounted to export subsidies that are completely illegal
under WTO rules.
 In the Airbus case, WTO judges found the company had been
able to launch a series of passenger aircraft only thanks to the
government support and called for an immediate end to the export
subsidies.
 Airbus says the findings in the Boeing report undermine its
U.S. competitor's business model.
 The findings in the related cases could colour a decision in
the coming weeks by the U.S. Air Force on whether to award
Boeing or Airbus parent EADS a $25-50 billion contract for
refuelling tankers. Both have support in the U.S. Congress as
they would be assembled in America.
 While each company argues about how many billions of dollars
the other received, and what percentage of claims were backed or
rejected by WTO judges, both have an interest in clarifying the
rules for how governments can facilitate the development of new
aircraft in a fair manner.
 It could take until much later this year for the appeals
process in both cases to run its course, but the two
governments, aware that Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan and
Russia have en eye on the market, are eventually likely to
negotiate a settlement.

 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Plane maker Boeing received
unfair subsidies from the U.S. government, according to a World
Trade Organization report on Monday, and Boeing and its European
rival Airbus immediately quarrelled over the scale of the
supports.
 European rival Airbus said the report showed Boeing had
received at least $5 billion in illegal subsidies and was only
able to launch its 787 Dreamliner with such support. Boeing
denied the assertions.
 The two trading superpowers have been fighting for more than
six years over each other's subsidies for large passenger
aircraft.
 Monday's report by WTO experts marked the latest stage in
the dispute as Airbus and Boeing battle for the $1.7 trillion
market.
 The findings in the related cases could colour a decision in
the coming weeks by the U.S. Air Force on whether to award
Boeing or Airbus parent EADS a $25-50 billion contract for
refuelling tankers. Both have supporters in the U.S. Congress,
as Boeing would build and finish the tanker in Washington and
Kansas while Airbus would assemble it in Alabama.
 With no end to the litigation in sight, both sides have
periodically called for a negotiated end to the dispute, as EU
Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht did in September when an
interim version of the report was issued..
 His spokesman noted on Monday the report confirmed those
initial findings, suggesting Brussels was not keen to raise the
stakes, or wanted to play down a previous WTO ruling that
condemned its own support for Airbus.
 ""This solid report sheds further light on the negative
consequences for the EU industry of these U.S. subsidies and
provides a timely element of balance in this long-running
dispute,"" spokesman John Clancy said in a statement.
 One EU diplomat said a political solution was preferable.
 ""Given the state of the global airline industry today, a
political agreement is important for both sides of the
Atlantic,"" the diplomat said.
 The ruling, like the interim report, was handed only to the
parties and was confidential. It will not be published for
several weeks while being translated into French and Spanish.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk's office said it could
not provide detailed comment now as the report was confidential.
 ""Despite that the EU has publicly commented on the report,
at this time we will simply say that the United States is
confident that the WTO will confirm the U.S. view that European
subsidies to Airbus dwarf any subsidies that the United States
provided to Boeing,"" spokeswoman Nefeterius McPherson said.
 
 MASSIVE SUBSIDIES
 Airbus said the report would show Boeing had received
billions of dollars in illegal subsidies, depriving Airbus of
$45 billion in sales, an indication of what the EU could seek in
sanctions if the case moved to retaliation.
 WTO experts found last year that Airbus received illegal
export subsidies from European governments and both sides have
appealed against that ruling.
 Appeals involving prohibited export subsidies are supposed
to be dealt with in 60 days under WTO rules, but this case is so
complicated that the WTO's appellate body has said it will not
come to a conclusion until some time this year.
 Boeing says the research and development grants it received
pale into insignificance besides the support for Airbus.
 In the Airbus case, WTO judges found the company had been
able to launch a series of passenger aircraft only thanks to the
government support and called for an end to export subsidies.
 Both countries have an interest in clarifying the rules for

'consumer prices')
 * Inflation highest since Oct 2008, well above ECB target
 * Rising oil price seen as main factor in spike
 * ECB seen upping rhetoric, not interest rates - analysts
 
(Adds euro reaction, links)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation rose more
than expected in January to further above the European Central
Bank's target, but the bank seems more likely for now to step up
its rhetoric on price pressures than raise interest rates.
 Comsumer prices in the 17 countries using the euro rose 2.4
percent year-on-year, the European Union's statistics office
Eurostat estimated on Monday, holding above the ECB's target of
just below 2 percent for the second month running after a 2.2
percent rise in December.
 January's rate was the highest since October 2008, when it
was 3.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected 2.3
percent.
 While analysts have attributed the rising price pressures
mainly to increases in non-core energy costs, the data boosted
the euro against the dollar as it kept alive the view that
interest rates in the euro zone may rise sooner than previously
thought.
 The ECB, which aims to keep inflation below but close to 2
percent, next meets on interest rates on Thursday, when it will
also face the problem of how to respond to stark discrepancies
between the pace of recovery in different euro zone states.
 ""While the ECB will be far from happy to see euro zone
consumer price inflation move further above target..., it is
still highly unlikely to prompt the bank into action at its
February policy meeting,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS
Global Insight.
 ""It will probably step up its anti-inflation rhetoric and
stress that it is prepared to hike interest rates despite growth
risks if the current spike-up ... shows any significant sign of
leading to a significant pick-up in second round inflationary
effects, such as rising wage settlements.""
 Any wage pressures would be most likely to emerge in
Europe's growth engine Germany, where the IG Metall union has
demanded hikes of 6 percent for workers at carmaker Volkswagen
and last week rejected an offer of 2.9 percent.
 BNP Paribas economist Clemente de Lucia said oil prices were
probably the main factor behind the January number, having risen
more than 3 euros per barrel in one month and almost 37 percent
year-on-year.
 
 FOOD PRICES PRESSURES LOW
 De Lucia said food prices were probably stable in January,
but core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices,
probably increased to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent.
 In its quarterly bulletin published on Monday in Dublin, the
Irish central bank said there was little evidence that high
commodity prices were affecting food prices in the euro zone.
 No monthly figure or breakdown of the year-on-year estimate
was available from Eurostat, and full inflation data for January
will be released on February 28.
 The ECB has said it expected prices to grow faster than its
target in the coming months, peaking at 2.4 percent in March and
then subsiding.
 ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said last Tuesday
he did not expect a decision to raise interest rates in the
first half of the year.
 But economists noted the bank's monetary policy choices were
becoming more difficult because of the difference in growth
rates, and therefore inflationary pressures, between countries
like Germany and strugglers on the euro zone periphery such as
Greece, Ireland and Spain.
""Clearly, setting a common monetary policy for divergent
economies will not be an easy task for the ECB,"" de Lucia said.
 ""The peripheral countries are facing serious deflationary
risks. By contrast, the output gap is closing in Germany, where
the unemployment rate is already below the pre-crisis level.
Therefore, some upward pressures are likely in Germany.""
 Economists said the central bank would probably step up its
rhetoric, with the ECB Governing Council meeting this week.
 ""ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will probably again sound
hawkish at Thursday's press conference,"" said Nick Kounis,
economist at ABN Amro.
 ""Although, given high unemployment and elevated economic
slack more generally, the risk of second-round (inflation)
effects seems low, Mr Trichet can have a dampening effect on
inflation expectations by sounding tough.""

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Sterling rose against the dollar
on Monday, lifted by euro gains and brushing off concerns about
unrest in Egypt, as investors debated the chances for a rise in
Bank of England interest rates in mid-2011.
 The pound rode the coattails of the euro, which rallied
after data showing a rise in January inflation further fuelled
speculation of higher euro zone interest rates.
 ""Cable has been knocked around by euro/dollar. The euro has
managed to claim back losses versus the dollar,"" said Jane
Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank.
 ""The dollar isn't showing its usual safe-haven qualities
because the Fed has been showing a soft policy stance.""
 Currencies seen to be higher risk, including the euro and
sterling, brushed off intensifying public protests against
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, which threaten to shake
political stability in other parts of northern Africa and the
Middle East.
 With investors focussed on rising global inflation
pressures, BoE policymaker Martin Weale wrote in the Guardian
newspaper that inflationary expectations risked becoming
entrenched the longer inflation stays above the central bank's 2
percent target.
 BoE minutes last week surprised markets by showing Weale
joined colleague Andrew Sentance in voting to raise UK rates by
25 basis points earlier this month from a record low 0.5
percent.
 But that was before fourth quarter data showed a shock
contraction in the economy and Weale said in Monday's article
that if such weakness continued, inflationary pressures would
likely ease without an increase in interest rates.
 A jump in euro zone inflation, however, also added to the
view that euro zone and UK rates may rise this year, offering
higher returns compared with those held in dollars as the
Federal Reserve is not seen raising rates anytime soon.
 The relatively loose U.S. monetary policy stance is
tarnishing demand for the dollar, which traditionally rises on
safe-haven buying during times of geopolitical uncertainty.
 By 1203 GMT, sterling had climbed around 0.3 percent on the
day to a session high of $1.5914, before pulling back to
$1.5890. In early London trade, traders cited Asian sovereign
demand as pushing the pound higher.
 
 DECEMBER HIGH
 Despite the pound's gains, analysts said the currency would
struggle to climb above a resistance level around $1.6060, a
high hit in December, adding that a rise above $1.5900 would
provide an opportunity to sell.
 In addition, the pound remained vulnerable to selling
towards $1.5710, the 50 percent retracement of sterling's rally
in the past month.
 Sterling slipped against the broadly stronger euro, which
edged up 0.2 percent to 85.99 pence.
 Sterling has rallied 1.7 percent versus the dollar so far
this month, pushed higher on anticipation that UK rates may rise
as early as in the first half of the year.
 Implied interest rate futures based on overnight index swaps
were pricing in a roughly 50 percent chance of a 25 basis point
rate rise by the BoE's policy meeting in May, little changed
from late last week.
 But data showing shock contraction in the UK economy has
reminded investors that higher rates may choke the economy's
fragile recovery, triggering stagflation which would weaken the
currency.
 Investors will focus on a slew of UK economic data due this
week, including figures on the manufacturing and services
sectors, housing prices and lending, to gauge the strength of
the recovery.

 By Luke Pachymuthu and Humeyra Pamuk
 SINGAPORE/DUBAI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil
company PDVSA is sending two cargoes of gasoline to Iran, trade
sources said on Monday, in a move that could help supply the
Islamic Republic despite U.S.-led international sanctions.
The cargoes are for February delivery, three trade sources
told Reuters. PDVSA was not immediately available for comment.
 ""It is no surprise at all,"" one trade source said.
""Venezuela, China -- countries like this, they don't care much
about the sanctions,"" he said.
 As a result of the sanctions, which came into effect in
mid-2010, major oil companies have halted business with Iran,
which is dependent on gasoline imports due to a lack of refining
capacity.
 Venezuela continued to send gasoline to Iran, shrugging off
the sanctions, until October last year, when the South American
OPEC member's energy minister said Iran no longer needed them.
 ""This is the time of the year when Iran's gasoline
requirements would go higher,"" another trade source said.
 The Islamic Republic, the world's fifth-largest crude
exporter, is dependent on fuel imports due to its lack of
refining capacity. It had imported 10-12 cargoes per month
before the sanctions.
 Its gasoline usage dropped after the government began
implementing an unpopular four-fold rise in prices in December
as part of a policy to phase out subsidies.
 ""We know that they had some stockpiles and they have boosted
their production through using their petrochemical plants. But
still they are short of gasoline,"" a third trade source said.
 ""It is getting very tight for them because of the sanctions,
but they are still managing to import,"" he added.

 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Global shares continued to slide
on Monday, while Europe's benchmark Brent crude was just short
of $100 a barrel on fears political unrest in Egypt could spread
among regional oil-producing nations.
 Protests to end the 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak
continued over the weekend, heightening risk aversion for
European investors already concerned by the effect their own
region's sovereign debt crisis and inflation could have on
growth.
 ""Whilst Egypt's importance to the global economy is limited,
its importance to the transportation of oil is huge,"" said
Jonathan Sudaria, night dealer at London Capital Group.
 ""Traders are concerned that with already rising inflation
and falling real incomes for consumers, a further rise in energy
prices could really dampen any consumer confidence and prospects
for growth.""
 Benchmark Brent crude had come off slightly to trade down
0.5 percent at $98.86 a barrel by 1143 GMT, after hitting a
28-month high on Friday, while benchmark U.S. crude futures were
flat.
OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri said on Monday the
group would boost supplies if needed, but he did not expect the
Egypt troubles to hit supplies via the country.
 ""Brent almost touched $100 and then kind of pulled back a
bit on profit taking but those are the fears that are keeping
prices well supported,"" said Amrita Sen, analyst at BarCap.
 Egypt remained the ""primary factor"" in the oil markets,
added David Land, chief market analyst at CMC Markets,
particularly what it could mean ""in terms of stability for such
a vital region for energy production"", he added.
 The Middle East and North African region produces more than
a third of the world's oil supply.
 Protests in Egypt follow the Jan. 14 collapse of the
Tunisian government, and there are fears similar unrest could
topple other autocratic states, including in the oil- and
gas-rich Gulf.
 Protest-contagion fears and risk aversion pushed European
shares down as much as 1 percent, with some traders taking the
opportunity to book profits, before losses were pared. At 1200
GMT, the index was down 0.5 percent.
 U.S. stock futures are flat to 0.2 percent higher after
Friday's biggest one-day loss in six months, but investors
remain cautious about political risk.
Elsewhere, the MSCI world equity index and Thomson Reuters
global stock index were both down around 0.3 percent, while
emerging stocks were down 0.9 percent.
 Egypt's stock exchange was closed on Monday as a result of
the protests, while, adding to Cairo's financial woes, ratings
agency Moody's downgraded the country's debt rating on concern
the Mubarak regime may spend more to placate protesters.
 Overnight in Asia, the Nikkei share average had ended down
1.2 percent while the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan stock index
fell 1.1 percent.
 Among commodities, spot gold fell after posting its largest
daily gain in eight weeks on Friday, while copper rose 1 percent
and other base metals also gained on short-covering ahead of a
week-long Chinese holiday.
 
 BUNDS, EURO HIGHER
 The euro and short-dated German bonds yields both got a
boost from news euro zone inflation had risen more than expected
in January, fuelling expectations for an interest rate rise.
 Consumer price inflation in the 17-nation euro area rose 2.4
percent year-on-year in January, well above the European Central
Bank's target to keep it below, but close to 2 percent.
 ""(The inflation data) is arguably in the price but as it
edges further away from the ECB target it will keep the market
focused upon inflation concerns,"" said Richard McGuire, a rates
strategist at Rabobank.
 Along the curve, the prospect of further turmoil in the
Middle East continued to underpin bond market sentiment.
 Also supportive was a report the European Union may extend
Greek and Irish bailout loans to 30 years, in an attempt to end
the sovereign debt crisis.
 In currency markets, the euro rose 0.5 percent against the
dollar after the inflation data, helping counter Friday's slide
on the back of safe-haven flows to the greenback and Swiss
franc.
 ""(European Central Bank President Jean-Claude) Trichet has
warned of a hump in inflation, this data shows a rise in
inflation and the market has reacted to it,"" said Kit Juckes,
currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 ""Important though Egypt is, the troubles there were more a
catalyst for a correction in risk appetite rather than the onset
of risk aversion,"" he added.
 Technical support for the euro is seen near $1.3570,
although spreading protests and a higher oil price would
""probably spark more short-term flows into the dollar"", said
Karl Olsson, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies by 1214 GMT.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Monday as above-forecast euro zone inflation kept alive the
view that interest rates in the region may rise sooner than
previously thought.
 The data helped the euro recover from losses resulting from
safe-haven buying of dollars, as well as Swiss francs and yen,
due to unrest in Egypt. Analysts said gains for these currencies
may be limited unless the trouble spreads to other countries.
 Traders cited Middle East accounts buying euros against the
dollar, lending further support after data showed euro zone
inflation rose to an annual rate of 2.4 percent in January from
2.2 percent in December, exceeding forecasts for a 2.3 percent
rise.
 ""(European Central Bank President Jean-Claude) Trichet has

 The euro was up 0.4 percent against the dollar at $1.3670,

 Euro zone inflation is well above the ECB's target to keep
the rate below but close to 2 percent and will keep intact
support for the euro based on the view that the European Central
Bank will raise interest rates much sooner than the U.S. Federal
Reserve.
 The three-month Euribor rate -- traditionally the main gauge
of unsecured interbank euro lending and a mix of interest rate
expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- rose to 1.074
percent from 1.063 percent, the highest since July 2009.
 The euro also rose against other currencies which had gained
as investors sought safety due to the Egypt unrest. Against the
Swiss franc it was up 0.5 percent at 1.2894 francs, while it
gained 0.5 percent to 112.36 yen.
 
 MIDDLE EAST WORRIES
 With street protests in Egypt showing no sign of abating,
however, investors remained wary that political upheaval could
hit other Arab countries, potentially disrupting oil production
and heightening tensions in the region.
 ""If the trouble really spreads and it pushes the oil price
up even more, then that would probably spark more short-term
flows into the dollar,"" said Karl Olsson, currency strategist at
SEB in Stockholm.
 Crude oil was steady at $89.20 per barrel after making a
brief show above $90 in European morning trade. It remained
supported on Middle-East supply concerns and traded around four
percent above Friday's low.
 The Egyptian crisis was seen having the potential to
overshadow economic events this week which include a slew of
data such as U.S. non-farm payrolls and central bank decisions.
 The dollar index was down 0.3 percent at 77.912, off a high
of 78.325. The U.S. unit was up 0.1 percent at 82.16 yen and up
0.2 percent at 0.9430 Swiss francs. 
 Data showed speculators increased bets against the U.S.
dollar and in favour of the euro in the latest week, but they
also scaled back net long positions in the commodity-linked
Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar
on Monday as above-forecast euro zone inflation kept alive the
view that interest rates in the region may rise sooner than
previously thought.
 The data helped the euro recover from losses resulting from
safe-haven buying of dollars, as well as Swiss francs and yen,
due to unrest in Egypt. Analysts said gains for these currencies
may be limited unless the trouble spreads to other countries.
 Traders cited Middle East accounts buying euros against the
dollar, lending further support after data showed euro zone
inflation rose to an annual rate of 2.4 percent in January from
2.2 percent in December, exceeding forecasts for a 2.3 percent
rise. [ID:nBRLVCE7AU]
 ""(European Central Bank President Jean-Claude) Trichet has
warned of a hump in inflation, this data shows a rise in
inflation and the market has reacted to it,"" said Kit Juckes,
currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 ""Important though Egypt is, the troubles there were more a
catalyst for a correction in risk appetite rather than the onset
of risk aversion,"" he added.
 The euro was up 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.3653
, keeping it away from an intraday low of $1.3570 hit on
trading platform EBS. 
 The low roughly corresponds with the 50 percent retracement
of the euro's November to January fall and could provide
short-term support, technical analysts said, while traders cited
Asian sovereign bids at $1.3570-80.
 Euro zone inflation is well above the ECB's target to keep
the rate below but close to 2 percent and will keep intact
support for the euro based on the view that the European Central
Bank will raise interest rates much sooner than the U.S. Federal
Reserve.
 Trichet has recently emphasised the need to monitor any
short-term rise in inflation in order to avoid second round
effects.
 The euro also rose against other currencies which had gained
as investors sought safety due to the Egypt unrest. Against the
Swiss franc it was up 0.5 percent at 1.2896 francs ,
while it gained 0.4 percent to 112.24 yen .

 * Outlook still sound, strong oil supports

(Recasts with reaction to central bank)
 MOSCOW, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Russia's rouble weakened on
Monday after the central bank dashed expectations of a rise in
interest rates, also hurt by a sell-off of riskier assets on
global markets, although high oil prices capped losses.
 The central bank caught most market participants unaware by
leaving rates on hold despite surging inflation, and instead
increased banks' reserves requirements -- especially for
non-residents. [ID:nLDE70U0I5]
 Higher interest rates would have added to returns on the
rouble while reserve requirements are seen only pruning the
currently excessive levels of liquidity by around 100 billion
roubles ($3.36 billion), according to Raiffeisen bank estimates.
 The total level of rouble liquidity stands at above 1
trillion roubles ($33.58 billion). The bank also pointed to
concerns over capital inflows as a reason for raising reserve
rates -- which may help deter excessive flows.
 ""Most analysts had predicted the central bank would hike
interest rates. I think such a decision is stipulated by central
bank's awareness of hot capital inflows,"" said Maxim Oreshkin,
chief Russia economist at Credit Agricole.
 Denis Korshilov, a dealer at Citi bank, said the bank's
decision had prompted some players to lock in profits on long
rouble positions on the last trading day of the month.
 Most analysts, however, said Russia's economic fundamentals
still supported more gains for the rouble. 
 Strong oil prices above $90 per barrel [O/R] are keeping
Russia in a current account surplus, while its borrowing plans,
including the first-ever rouble Eurobond, may spur capital
inflows. [ID:nLDE70R1W8]
 Market players say the level of 34.50 roubles against the
basket may serve as resistance for further rallies in the
Russian unit as the central bank is expected to step in the
market buying some $150 million a day in the range of 34.0-34.5.
 ""While we remain bullish, the pace of upside is likely to
slow. We are approaching levels where the Central Bank of Russia
will begin accumulating dollars in decent size, providing a
headwind,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley said.
 By 1030 GMT, the rouble gave up 11 kopecks to 29.82 against
the dollar . It also weakened 3 kopecks to 40.73
versus the euro .
Against the euro-dollar basket, used by the central bank to
monitor exchange rates, the rouble weakened to 34.71 compared
with levels of around 34.65 seen before the rate decision and
34.64 at Friday's closing.

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation jumped more
than expected in January to further above the European Central
Bank's target, but the bank seems more likely for now to step up
its rhetoric on price pressures than raise interest rates.
 Inflation in the 17 countries using the euro rose 2.4
percent year-on-year, the European Union's statistics office
Eurostat estimated on Monday, holding above the ECB's target of
just below 2 percent for the second month running after a 2.2
percent rise in December.
 January's rate was the highest since October 2008, when it
was 3.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected 2.3
percent.
 While analysts have attributed the rising price pressures
mainly to increases in non-core energy costs, the data boosted
the euro against the dollar as it kept alive the view that
interest rates in the euro zone may rise sooner than previously
thought.
 The ECB, which aims to keep inflation below but close to 2
percent, next meets on interest rates on Thursday, when it will
also face the problem of how to respond to stark discrepancies
between the pace of recovery in different euro zone states.
 ""While the ECB will be far from happy to see euro zone
consumer price inflation move further above target..., it is
still highly unlikely to prompt the bank into action at its
February policy meeting,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS
Global Insight.
 ""It will probably step up its anti-inflation rhetoric and
stress that it is prepared to hike interest rates despite growth
risks if the current spike-up ... shows any significant sign of
leading to a significant pick-up in second round inflationary
effects, such as rising wage settlements.""
 Any wage pressures would be most likely to emerge in
Europe's growth engine Germany, where the IG Metall union has
demanded hikes of 6 percent for workers at carmaker Volkswagen
and last week rejected an offer of 2.9 percent.
 BNP Paribas economist Clemente de Lucia said oil prices were
probably the main factor behind the January number, having risen
more than 3 euros per barrel in one month and almost 37 percent
year-on-year.
 
 FOOD PRICES PRESSURES LOW
 De Lucia said food prices were probably stable in January,
but core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices,
probably increased to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent.
 In its quarterly bulletin published on Monday in Dublin, the
Irish central bank said there was little evidence that high
commodity prices were affecting food prices in the euro zone.
 No monthly figure or breakdown of the year-on-year estimate
was available from Eurostat, and full inflation data for January
will be released on February 28.
 The ECB has said it expected prices to grow faster than its
target in the coming months, peaking at 2.4 percent in March and
then subsiding.
 ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said last Tuesday
he did not expect a decision to raise interest rates in the
first half of the year.
 But economists noted the bank's monetary policy choices were
becoming more difficult because of the difference in growth
rates, and therefore inflationary pressures, between countries
like Germany and strugglers on the euro zone periphery such as
Greece, Ireland and Spain.
""Clearly, setting a common monetary policy for divergent
economies will not be an easy task for the ECB,"" de Lucia said.
 ""The peripheral countries are facing serious deflationary
risks. By contrast, the output gap is closing in Germany, where
the unemployment rate is already below the pre-crisis level.
Therefore, some upward pressures are likely in Germany.""
 Economists said the central bank would probably step up its
rhetoric, with the ECB Governing Council meeting this week.
 ""ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will probably again sound
hawkish at Thursday's press conference,"" said Nick Kounis,
economist at ABN Amro.
 ""Although, given high unemployment and elevated economic
slack more generally, the risk of second-round (inflation)
effects seems low, Mr Trichet can have a dampening effect on
inflation expectations by sounding tough.""

(Adds Klepach, Lombard rules, opinion poll)
 By Toni Vorobyova and Andrey Ostroukh
 MOSCOW, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Russia unexpectedly left all
interest rates on hold on Monday to support economic growth and
deter excessive capital inflows, choosing instead to battle
inflation with a rise in banks' reserve requirements.
 Corporate bond prices edged up, while the rouble -- which
had gained 1 percent since the start of the year on the back of
high oil prices and rate hike expectations -- closed down 11
kopecks to 34.75 against the basket.
Improved global risk appetite has spurred cash into emerging
markets, prompting concern from authorities that short-term
inflows in search of higher yields could become destabilising.
The Russian move comes just days after the Turkish central bank
raised reserve ratios on lira deposits.
 In Russia, reserve requirements for banks' liabilities to
corporate non-residents will be raised by 100 basis points to
3.50 percent from Feb. 1, while for other types of liabilities
they will be increased by 50 basis points to 3.00 percent.
 ""The above decision is taken in the conditions of growing
inflation expectations and the formation of reasons for capital
inflow into Russia against a backdrop of high global oil
prices,"" the central bank said in a statement.
 All rates were left on hold, including the overnight deposit
rate at 2.75 percent and the refinancing rate at 7.75 percent.
 ""Such a step may be explained by a rise in oil prices in
January, which may lead to an increased speculative demand for
the rouble, and higher rates would further fuel inflows of hot
money,"" said Alexandra Yevtifyeva, analyst at VTB Capital.
 Higher rates could also indirectly fuel inflation if they
led to a stronger currency and prompted greater central bank
interventions, which would inject more roubles into the system.
 Analysts at Raiffeisen estimated that the reserve
requirements hike would mop up around 100 billion roubles ($3.4
billion) of excess liquidity from the system, while VTB Capital
put the figure at 60 billion roubles.
 Separately, the central bank announced a rise in minimum
rating requirements for collateral used in its Lombard auctions
from Feb. 1 -- a move analysts said fitted into its policy of
unwinding anti-crisis measures but could also play a small part
in helping reduce banking system liquidity.
 Consumer prices have already risen 1.8 percent in the first
24 days of January with officials saying it would be ""tough"" to
stay within the full-year inflation target of just 6-7 percent.
 The official target has not yet been revised up, but Deputy
Economy Minister Andrei Klepach on Monday forecast 2011
inflation at 7-8 percent.
 Inflation topped the list of Russians' concerns, attracting
62 percent of votes in a Levada poll published on Monday,
followed by rising unemployment at 42 percent and economic
crisis at 30 percent.
 Inflation worries had prompted the central bank to hike
deposit rates by 25 basis points in December, and it had been
expected to administer a similar move on Monday.
 But concerns about fragile economic growth and the
possibility of an inflow of speculative capital prompted the
central bank to focus on reserve requirements instead.
 ""Despite a positive trend in a number of macroeconomic
indicators ... uncertainty remains in the stability of economic
growth,"" it said.
 
 DIFFERENT TO TURKEY
 Liabilities to non-residents had been subject to higher
reserve requirements in 2008, before the global economic crisis
hit Russia and sent foreign capital fleeing from the country.
 Analysts said Russia would stick to influencing capital
flows through monetary policy, with officials having repeatedly
pledged to refrain from capital controls.
 ""A lot of policymakers in office today spent a lot of time
trying to remove Soviet-style restrictions and they would be
reluctant to put them back in place,"" said Tim Ash, Head of
CEEMEA research at RBS in London.
 Unlike Turkey, Russia has yet to see any serious capital
inflows, and in fact posted outflows of some $38 billion in
outflows last year -- making the current move pre-emptive.
 ""For Russia, this threat is much less serious (than Turkey)
... Taking into account the current level of inflation and
interest rates, there remains the possibility and the need to
raise rates without a serious threat of capital inflows,"" said
Alexander Morozov, chief economist Russia at HSBC.
 ""The high level of inflation in itself is a factor that
scares off capital inflows.""
 Retail sales and average wages rose less than expected in
December, showing kinks in the strength of the economic
recovery, albeit ones that can be blamed on inflation.
 However, data on Monday showed gross domestic product (GDP)
growth accelerated to 4.5 percent year-on-year in December from
4.2 percent the previous month.

 (Adds reaction, comments)	
 By Nigam Prusty and Paul de Bendern	
 NEW DELHI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - India's environment ministry
approved on Monday South Korean POSCO's plans for a
$12 billion steel mill, a boost for the foreign investment
climate in Asia's third-largest economy after several setbacks
for big ticket industrial projects.	
 The long-delayed clearance for India's biggest foreign
direct investment (FDI) follows a year in which Environment
Minister Jairam Ramesh has blocked several projects, raising
criticism he was jeapordising India's growth story.	
 India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies,
needs foreign capital to boost infrastructure and allow its
economy to grow at near double digits. But projects have met
with protests from largely poor farmers in this densely
populated country.	
 ""It's very good news that this issue has now been settled,""
said Taina Erajuuri, Helsinki-based portfolio manager at FIM
India, which owns about $150 million worth of Indian shares.	
 ""India, unlike China, is a very difficult country for
foreign companies to get approvals, specially environmental
approvals. Many foreign companies want to come to India but the
country is very bureaucratic, to put it mildly.""	
 
 The mill in eastern Orissa state has been delayed by
criticism it would ruin lives of thousands of poverty-stricken
people, who say the plant will disrupt their betel leaf
plantations and forest-based livelihoods. 
 ""Undoubtedly projects such as that of POSCO have
considerable economic, technological and strategic significance
for the country,"" the environment ministry said. ""At the same
time, laws on environment and forests must be implemented
seriously.""	
 The ministry attached a series of additional conditions for
POSCO, but analysts said they were not major obstacles. A
government panel had earlier said there were no ecological
concerns over the plant.	
 POSCO is among several corporations, including Vedanta
Resources , which have come under scrutiny from Ramesh,
putting his ministry in conflict with others in the government
who are pushing for rapid industrialisation. 
 A series of corruption scandals has shaken the government of
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and a recent minor cabinet
reshuffle saw several ministers' portfolios change, but Ramesh
stayed on as environment minister, indicating his influence.	
 The ruling Congress party head, Sonia Gandhi, is keen to win
over farmers hit by big projects at well as ensuring industrial
jobs are created -- a fine line that may have helped create
regulatory uncertainty before state elections this year and a
general election in 2014.	
 
 REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY	
 While investors tend to shrug off corruption scandals as a
risk of emerging markets, regulatory uncertainty threatens to
taint India's attractiveness as a destination for foreign firms
eager for a slice of its booming $1.3 trillion economy. And the
approval granted to POSCO is unlikely to change sentiment.	
 ""I don't think there will be a rush of investments or
environmental clearances after this (approval), it should still
continue to be a slow process,"" said Andrew Holland, chief
executive for equities at Ambit Capital in Mumbai.	
 FDI in India fell 27 percent to about $14 billion in the
current fiscal year through November, dragged down in part by
delays in big investments. The central bank has also raised
concern about the regulatory environment.	
 China, whose economy is almost four times bigger than
India's but which Delhi regards as its regional rival, drew a
record $105.7 billion in FDI in 2010. 
 In October, Ramesh threw out plans by London-listed Vedanta
to expand its alumina refinery over worries it would destroy a
hill considered scared by tribal peoples.	
 But this month, he said he was willing to conditionally
reconsider Vedanta's expansion plan, and the ministry also said
it could consider approving Hindustan Construction Co's
ambitious Lavasa project, a $31 billion town proposed
to be built in a forested area near the city of Pune.	
 A back-and-forth on whether to ban iron ore exports in the
Karnataka state has also worried investors. ArcelorMittal
, the world's top steel maker, has also faced years of
delays in building several plants in India.	
 Approval for the POSCO mill would see the Orissa government
immediately starting to acquire land for the world's
third-largest steelmaker's project.	
 ""The decision will help us proceed with the stalled project,
as it will allow us to resume land acquisition among other
things,"" said a POSCO spokesman in Seoul.	
 POSCO still faces a series of hurdles that could delay the
project, such as a court case filed by a local firm against the
Orissa government, contesting its decision to grant a mining
concession to the South Koreans.	
 India, which has not yet been able to exploit its potential
as a natural resources-rich country, is keen to boost its trade
and political ties with South Korea while Seoul looks to tap
into the $150 billion Indian nuclear power market.	
 Direct investors -- companies building factories or power
plants or buying local firms -- often have less flexibility and
more to lose than fund investors and are especially sensitive to
regulatory uncertainty.	
 Leading global companies such as Wal-Mart Stores ,
Vodafone and POSCO have been frustrated for years in
their efforts to negotiate regulations in a promising but
perilous market, and FDI has suffered.

(Adds detail, background and comment)	
 By Apornrath Phoonphongphiphat	
 BANGKOK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Thailand, the world's biggest
rice exporter, could produce a record high volume in its second
crop, but traders said demand remained strong and that would
hold prices up, adding to unease over food price inflation.	
 Apichart Jongsakul, head of the Office of Agriculture
Economy, said the Agriculture Ministry expected 9.5 million
tonnes of paddy from the 2010/11 second crop to be harvested
from late February to June, up from 8.8 million last year.	
 ""It would be the highest ever since Thailand started growing
off-season a few decades ago and it's due to the fact that firm
prices encouraged farmers to grow more rice,"" he told Reuters.	
 Indonesia surprised the market last week with the purchase
of 820,000 tonnes of rice from Thailand for prompt shipment.	
 The aggressive purchase from a country of 230 million people
seemed aimed at bringing down inflation, which is at a 20-month
high, a view reinforced by Indonesia's scrapping of import
duties on rice, soybeans and wheat on Friday. 
 
 Thailand's benchmark 100 percent B grade white rice
 was at $540 per tonne on Monday. It has barely
changed this year after falling 13 percent last year. 
 In comparison U.S. wheat and corn futures have
risen by more than half since the start of last year.	
 
 MOUNTING DEMAND	
 Traders expect the Philippines, the world's biggest buyer,
to step into the market and start buying rice around March.	
 This month Bangladesh, an impoverished country of 150
million people and South Asia's biggest rice buyer, tripled its
import target to 900,000 tonnes for the year to June 30 to cool
prices.	
 Traders there have reported panic buying of rice and
hoarding after a 50 percent jump in local prices over the past
year.	
 But traders say even strong demand from Manila seems
unlikely to push rice back up to the record high of $1,080 per
tonne hit in 2008 as prices will be held down by ample supply
from the big producers. 
 Traders generally expect the benchmark 100 percent B grade
to stay in a range of $500-$600 per tonne this year.	
 ""I see a rise in supply this year, although not any huge
increase. Either way, supply could rise to meet any increase in
demand,"" said a Bangkok-based trader.	
 Chookiat Ophaswongse, honorary president of the Thai Rice
Exporters Association, took a similar view.	
 ""Despite increasing supply, I don't expect prices to drop as
the rise in supply would meet rising demand eventually,"" he
said.	
 Apichart at the Thai Agriculture Ministry said farmers whose
crops were destroyed by flooding in late October had rushed to
plant extra rice to offset their losses. Farmers in many parts
of the country often harvest three crops a year.	
 With a bumper second crop, plus 22.3 million tonnes of paddy
produced from the main 2010/11 crop harvested from November,
Thailand would have a total 31.8 million tonnes of paddy, a
little more than the 30 million it produces in a normal year.	
 That equates to around 19 million tonnes of milled rice for
domestic consumption and export in 2011, Apichart said.	
 Vietnam, the world's second-biggest rice exporter, should be
harvesting its main crop in February. It is expected to raise
output this year from the 40 million tonnes it produced in 2010.

 LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Global shares continued to slide
on Monday, while Europe's benchmark Brent crude was just short

 Protests to end the 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak

down 0.4 percent at $98.93 a barrel by 0900 GMT, after hitting a
28-month high on Friday.
 ""The Egyptian situation looks to be the primary factor,""
said David Land, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. The market
is reacting to ""what this could mean in terms of stability for
such a vital region for energy production"", he added.
 The protests in Egypt follow the collapse of the Tunisian
government two weeks ago, and there are fears of similar unrest
in other autocratic states including oil-rich Gulf nations.
 Protest-contagion fears and risk aversion pushed European
shares lower again at the open, with the FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> down 1 percent at 0900 GMT after falling 1 percent on
Friday.
 Elsewhere, the MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> and
Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> were also both
down around 0.5 percent, while emerging stocks  were
down 1 percent.
 Overnight in Asia, the Nikkei share average <.N225> had
ended down 1.2 percent while the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan
stock index fell 1.1 percent.
 Among commodities, spot gold  steadied after hitting
an Egypt-fuelled eight-week high on Friday, while copper 
rose 1.1 percent and other base metals also gained on
short-covering ahead of a week-long Chinese holiday.

 * Euro supported by Asian sovereign buying
 * But market wary that Egypt unrest could spread elsewhere

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The euro steadied against the
dollar on Monday as moves to exit riskier positions tapered off,
with Asian sovereign buying helping it to recover from sharp
losses, but investors were wary of more Middle East unrest.
 As street protests in Egypt showed no sign of abating,
investors were concerned political upheaval could hit other Arab
countries, potentially disrupting oil production and heightening
diplomatic tensions in the region.
 The trouble in Egypt has sparked safe-haven buying of
dollars, as well as Swiss franc and yen, against the euro and
higher-yielding currencies, though analysts said further dollar
gains could be limited unless the unrest spreads.
 Traders also reported Asian sovereigns buying the euro
around $1.36, keeping it away from an intraday low of $1.3570
hit on trading platform EBS. It was last steady at $1.3614.
 The low roughly corresponds with the 50 percent retracement
of the euro's November to January fall and could provide
short-term support, technical analysts said.
 ""The euro saw a blip down against the dollar, but it may be
that we have seen the worst of it and the market's attention may
turn elsewhere,"" said Karl Olsson, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm.
 ""But if the trouble really spreads and it pushes the oil
price up even more then that would probably spark more
short-term flows into the dollar"".
 The dollar index was steady at 78.152, off a high of 78.325.
 The dollar was steady at 82.10 yen and 0.9423 Swiss francs,
while the euro edged 0.1 percent lower versus the yen to 111.71
yen.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar was steady at $0.9924,
off a low of $0.9866, supported by gains in commodities which
helped to offset increased risk aversion.
 Data showed speculators increased bets against the U.S.
dollar and in favour of the euro in the latest week, but they
also scaled back net long positions in the commodity-linked
Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 ""Any worsening in fears over stability in the Middle East
would further dampen risk appetite, providing support for safe-
haven currencies like the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and yen,""
said Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Mike Jones. 
 
 SPREADING UNREST
 Investors remained wary, however. The Egyptian crisis is
seen as having the potential to overshadow economic events this
week which include a slew of data such as U.S. non-farm payrolls
and central bank decisions.
 Some investors fear that what's happening in Egypt could be
repeated elsewhere, which could threaten their investments in
many emerging markets -- one of the most lucrative strategies
last year.
 ""Behind the unrest is anger against inflation, which is
hurting many people in developing countries. The trouble is,
that is also happening in countries like India and China, too,""
said Tokai Tokyo Securities' Saito.
 ""A flood of money created in the developed world has been
flowing to emerging markets. But if those markets turn out to be
politically unstable, that money flow will drastically change.""

 By Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Vessels at Egypt's port of
Suez are unable to pick-up military escorts for protection
through the pirate-prone Gulf of Aden due to the unrest in the
country, a senior industry official said on Monday.	
 Ships have been travelling through the Suez Canal, the main
passageway for Europe's crude oil and imported goods, as usual
with no reports of delays or cancellations.	
 Operations at the port have slowed, however, as
anti-government protests have kept supplies and some staff from
reaching the docks.	
 ""No ships have been delayed, but there have been no
immigration or customs officials to clear security teams for
shipments for the past two days,"" said a senior coordinator with
a shipping firm operating in Suez, who wished not to be named.	
 ""Crew changes for ships have also stopped and some
provisions, like food and water, were not reaching the port,"" he
added.	
 Suez has jumped into the world's radar as the scene of
clashes between government forces and protesters demanding the
removal of President Hosni Mubarak, who has ruled Egypt for
three decades. 
 Half of all vessels that travel through the Suez Canal stop
at the port city to re-supply, refuel, change crew and pick-up
security escorts, the company official said.	
 More than 34,000 vessels passed through the canal in 2009,
of which nearly 2,700 were oil tankers carrying some 29 million
tonnes of oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. 
 Ships were now docking at ports in nearby countries, like
Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, to obtain military escorts
and supplies.	
 The maritime industry has become increasingly reliant on
military escorts for protection against Somali pirates when
travelling through the Gulf of Aden via the Suez Canal.	
 Global pirate attacks hit a seven-year high in 2010 and a
record number of crew were taken hostage, with Somali pirates
accounting for 49 of the 52 ships seized, the International
Maritime Bureau watchdog said this month.

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 HONG KONG, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Brent oil futures climbed near
$100 a barrel and Asian stocks fell on Monday, hurt by fears
that deadly protests in Egypt may foment unrest throughout the
Middle East and choke oil supplies, accelerating a move out of
riskier assets.	
 More than 100 people have been killed during six days of
protests in Egypt aimed at toppling President Hosni Mubarak.	
 A wider conflagration in the region could threaten the flow
of oil at a time when policymakers in emerging markets are
already bedevilled by high food and fuel prices and some
developed economies have been gaining momentum. 
 U.S. S&P 500 futures were up 0.2 percent after Wall
Street closed down 1.8 percent on Friday, while U.S. Treasury
futures were flat on the day, suggesting that investors
would take a wait-and-watch approach to the Middle East. 
 ""To the extent that the instability continues, investor
reaction will most likely push oil and Treasury bond prices
higher, and global equities lower."" Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief
investment officer at bond giant PIMCO, told Reuters. 
 ""The situation in Egypt is very fluid.""	
 The U.S. dollar, yen and Swiss franc, which all strengthened
against the euro on Friday in reaction to the escalating
Egyptian situation were largely stable, with protesters in Cairo
camped out and calling for Mubarak to step down after 30 years
of rule.	
 The prospect of more expensive energy bills in high growth
emerging markets added to unease about rising inflation among
investors, who had last week pulled money out of developing
equity markets for the first time in more than a month, fund
tracker EPFR Global said in a note.	
 Emerging Asian currencies, down broadly on Monday, will be
tested this week ahead of Lunar New Year holidays, with focus on
inflation data from Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand due on
Tuesday. 
 Japan's Nikkei share average finished 1.2 percent
lower, and at one point hit its lowest since early December.	
 The MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan stock index
fell 1.1 percent, with selling scattered across the consumer
discretionary, industrial and materials sectors. 
 Stocks in Indonesia and the Philippines were the hardest
hit, with benchmark indexes falling 2.1 and 2.6 percent,
respectively. These markets were among last year's biggest
gainers in Asia and the latest bout of risk reduction has made
investors more willing to take profits. 
 Egyptian markets and banks were closed on Monday.	
 
 OIL HEADS TO $100	
 U.S. crude for March delivery was trading at around
$90 a barrel after hitting a high of $90.87 a barrel early in
the session. Focus would likely be on Brent futures though,
where the lead month contract was trading just shy of $100 a
barrel .	
 ""For the global economy, Egypt is less important, though it
does matter for access to the Suez Canal, a key oil distribution
route,"" ANZ Bank economist Sharon Zollner said in a note to
clients. 
""The greater fear is that the turmoil could spread to other
Middle East countries, including even Saudi Arabia. If that
happens, then all bets on oil prices are off.""	
 Egypt controls the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean
(SUMED) Pipeline, which between them moved more than 2 million
barrels per day (bpd) of crude and oil products in 2009.

 Some analysts believe the selling of risky assets in
emerging Asia will subside rather quickly because of the
region's relatively superior fundamentals, particularly when it
comes to credit markets. 
 ""Asia will begin to decouple very quickly and even in the
Middle East will start distinguishing between names. People will
start looking to go long the risk and some of these trades will
begin unwinding soon,"" said Vijay Chander, credit strategist
with Standard Chartered Bank.	
 In the currency market, the euro was largely stable at
$1.3610. The euro has rallied for three weeks and risen to
two-month highs, though the Egyptian turmoil as well as risks
surrounding a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday may
press it against major support at $1.3535 later this week.	
 Gold and other precious metals are traditionally seen as
safe havens at times of geopolitical uncertainty. Spot gold has
been under pressure though because growing optimism about the
U.S. recovery reduced the need for havens.	
 Gold was at $1,335 per ounce , just above a four-month
low of $1,308 on Friday.

 By Adrian Bathgate 
 WELLINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Asian stocks are likely to
fall on Monday, with safer assets such as gold and bonds likely
to benefit as unrest in Egypt continues to rattle world markets.	
 Futures markets are seen down after Wall Street's S&P 500
suffered its biggest one-day loss in six months on
Friday, while the traditional flight-to-safety assets of gold
and U.S. Treasuries rose. 
 Protests in Egypt continued on Sunday, as embattled
President Hosni Mubarak met with army generals, while potential
challenger Mohamed ElBaradei claimed a mandate to negotiate a
new government. For more see 
 ""For the global economy Egypt is less important, though it
does matter for access to the Suez Canal, a key oil distribution
route,"" ANZ Bank economist Sharon Zollner said in a note to
clients. 
 ""The greater fear is that the turmoil could spread to other
Middle East countries, including even Saudi Arabia. If that
happens, then all bets on oil prices are off,"" Zollner said.	
 Japanese markets are set to open lower on Monday, with
Nikkei futures traded in Chicago 135 points below the
last closing level in Osaka .	
 The Australian market is also looking at a sharp fall when
trading starts at 2300 GMT, with share price index futures
down 49 points or 1 percent to 4,708, a 66.9 point
discount to the underlying close of the S&P/ASX 200 index
.	
 The New Zealand stock exchange, the first Asia-Pacific
bourse to open, saw its benchmark index fall 0.4 percent
to 3,340.46.	
 The euro fell below $1.36 in early trade while the
Australian dollar also suffered at the expensive of
traditional safe havens such as the yen and U.S. Dollar.	
 Oil looks set to extend its gains, with Brent crude
possibly cracking the $100 a barrel mark, while spot gold
, traditionally the safe-haven of choice, will also likely
rise.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2011 12:16PM ET</span>",EXCLUSIVE-Germany plans Kazakhstan raw materials partnership," * German BDI industry group working on initiative with govts
 * Quest for rare-earth deals could extend to other countries
 
 By Andreas Rinke
 BERLIN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Germany has been working for
months on establishing an exclusive raw materials partnership
with resource-rich Kazakhstan, government and business sources
told Reuters.
 The initiative aims to secure access for companies to
strategic materials not readily available on world markets,
especially rare earths that have been at the centre of a trade
dispute with China, the sources said at the weekend.
 German industry federation BDI said it had received several
positive responses from a dozen or so mid-sized companies to
which it had floated the idea just before Christmas.
 ""Talks are at an early stage. The BDI is looking into some
of the initial ideas,"" a spokesman said. ""Given the high
dependency on imports of raw materials, in particular metals,
direct cooperation in digging projects abroad could help.""
 Shortages of rare earth minerals used in high-tech and
defence production have sent jitters around the world since
dominant producer China restricted exports.
 The German government is deeply involved in the initiative
to improve access, sources said, and a secretary from the
economy ministry, Bernd Pfaffenbach, has been assigned to boost
political support for the idea.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel supports the idea of bilateral raw
materials partnerships, and said on Saturday it was important
for German companies to have unlimited access to raw materials.
 The Kazakh side is interested in technology transfer from
the deal, while Europeans want to wean themselves off dependence
on Russia and the growing influence of China.
Kazakhstan, mainly a gas exporter, is one of the few
countries which, like China, has large deposits of rare earth
minerals.
 Political hurdles do remain, however, as Germany has
criticised Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's plan to hold
onto his job as leader of central Asia's largest economy for
life.
 Kazakhstan is not the only state that could be part of the
plan. Government sources said interest existed on both sides for
Mongolia, which last year saw a high number of visits by German
officials.
 The resource hunt there raises other challenges --
exploiting mines would require major investment in the country's
rail infrastructure.

 * Inflation, jobs tests ahead
 * Egypt bubbles in background
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Fundamentals and nasty surprises
are on investors minds heading into February, with big tests in
the coming week about jobs and inflation and increasing worries
over Egypt and its region.
 The latter has already hit oil prices and has started to
rattle equities. U.S. crude oil futures ended more than 4
percent higher on Friday, on concerns the civil unrest in Egypt
could spread and threaten stability in the Middle East.
 Overall, however, the first month of the year has been a
good one for investors willing to take on some risk.
 Until Friday's sell off, global equities were gaining at a
rate that would have produced one of the best years in the past
four decades.
 Assets such as short-term high-yielding bonds have also been
in favour, while supposedly safe-haven developed market
sovereign debt has suffered.
 This is all based on a consensus that arose towards the end
of last year that leading developed economies -- the United
States, the euro zone and even Japan -- were likely to become
more dynamic.
 It has prompted a significant shift by investors away from
potentially overbought emerging markets into developed ones.
 But it is also dependent on underlying evidence the big
economies are improving and that consumers -- the ultimate
arbiters -- will see this and act accordingly by spending.
 Friday's U.S. growth data will have added to the view of
slow but steady improvement.
 The coming week will be more about the way improving growth
has filtered down to consumers. The big data release, as usual,
will be the U.S. jobs report on Friday, but the euro zone
employment picture will also be on view on Tuesday.
 Employment growth tends to lag the wider recovery, but to
date it has been aenemic, prompting a degree of volatility.
 ""It is a fairly shallow jobless recovery, and that will make
markets move up and down,"" said Franz Wenzel, a strategist with
AXA Investment Managers in Paris.
 Despite the renewed growth hopes, meanwhile, there are
severe underlying imbalances in many developed economies that
may rise up to haunt investors betting on overall improvement.
 The International Monetary Fund said in the past week the
United States and Japan needed to spell out credible
deficit-cutting plans before financial markets started punishing
them by selling off their bonds.
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's went as far as cutting
Japan's long-term debt rating and Moody's Investors Service said
the risk of the United States losing its top AAA rating,
although small, was rising.
 This is disturbing talk for investors and prompted downward
pressure on Japanese assets such as the yen and stocks even
though some, like Goldman Sachs, have recently been encouraging
investors to look at Japan.
 PRICE WORRIES
 The flip side of growth is inflation, and this too is
becoming a worry for some investors. Some of the recent shift
into developed market equities, for example, has been promoted
by fears of central bank tightening in emerging markets as a
result of sharp price rises.
 Inflation in the euro zone may be the new concern, with data
due on Monday and a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday.
 Some policymakers have fired warning shots, in particular,
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, one of six ECB board members.
 He said during the past week that sharper rises in prices of
commodities and emerging economy-made goods could push up euro
zone inflation unless domestic prices were controlled.
 The prospect of higher euro zone interest rates drove the
euro higher against other currencies -- a potential problem, if
sustained, for exporters -- and promoted bond yields to rise.
 Britain too has seen inflation rise to levels where some
investors are beginning to price in an interest rate hike.
 Tighter monetary policy against a background of only
tentative economic recovery would be a threat to the consensus
being formed by investors.
 For the moment, however, investors seem relaxed.
 ""Inflation is currently above the ECB's price target of 2
percent,"" private bank Sarasin said in a note. ""(But) the ECB
will look through (the) base effect from higher energy prices in
their monthly meeting. We expect the ECB to leave interest rates
at the current level in 2011.""
 
 EGYPT
 What few, if any, large investors foresaw in their 2011
outlooks, however, was the potential for an entire region to
come under sudden scrutiny as North Africa and the Middle East
has in recent weeks.
 The focus is on Egypt, where President Hosni Mubarak's long
grip on power is being threatened by huge demonstrations.
 For global investors the specific stakes are small. Over the
past five years, overseas investors have accounted for 15.9
percent of the Cairo stock exchange's total trading value of
less than $500 billion for the period.
 As for the region, Middle East and North Africa funds
had net inflows of $237 million in 2010, according to EPFR
Global, although more came in through frontier market funds.
 So, the money stakes are not the issue. What investors will
be watching for in the coming week is how much the crisis
spreads and triggers a broader flight to safety from emerging
markets and riskier assets.

 * Rising prices fuel concerns over export curbs
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 30 (Reuters) - As World Trade
Organization members intensify efforts for a new trade deal,
soaring food and raw material prices have raised a question that
is not even on the Doha round agenda: export restrictions.
 While WTO members are haggling over the extent to which
tariffs come down, countries spooked by the memory of the 2008
food crisis that sparked riots around the globe are slashing
import duties to let food come in as cheaply as possible.
 Food inflation has been one of the hot topics at the annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. French President
Nicolas Sarkozy, who currently chairs the G20, called for more
regulation to curb speculation and volatility.
 The latest surge in food prices was fuelled by export
restrictions on grain imposed by Russia -- not yet a member of
the WTO -- and Ukraine to deal with a severe drought last year.
 Just as in 2008, trading partners have asked whether you are
allowed to halt exports without regard to the rest of the world.
 But the rules-based trading system built up since World War
Two and umpired by the WTO concentrates primarily on removing
barriers to imports.
 ""In the WTO import restrictions are better disciplined than
export restrictions,"" WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said.
 
 CONFRONTATION
 It's not just about food.
 Industrialists in Japan and Germany were terrified when
China cut back supplies last year of rare earths -- the minerals
used in high-tech goods from hybrid cars and mobile phones to
defence products, of which China is a near-monopoly supplier.
 The European Union will issue a strategy document on
Wednesday on raw materials, Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht
told Reuters. According to a draft seen by Reuters, the EU will
consider stockpiling raw materials and confront any country that
restricts supplies
 For the EU the issue is not just curbs on the physical
amount of exports, but the practice in some states of imposing
export duties. These create dual pricing, making industry inputs
cheaper for domestic manufacturers than for foreign competitors.
 Brussels has insisted Russia scrap export duties on lumber
if it wants to join the WTO and, together with the United States
and Mexico, has challenged Chinese duties and restrictions at
the global trade body.
 Trade officials say there is no reason why exports could not
be regulated in the same way as imports. Barriers to exports
would be illegal, but countries would have safeguards -- a
safety valve allowing them to block exports temporarily to
ensure vital food supplies at home.
 During the 2008 crisis Japan proposed introducing some
tentative rules along those lines. But developing country food
exporters shot down the idea.
 Now it is time to look at the question again, said Anabel
Gonzalez, foreign trade minister of Costa Rica -- a small
developing country that exports tropical products like bananas,
pineapples and coffee but relies on imports for staples such as
wheat and soybeans.
 ""This is a pending issue for a future agenda that certainly
needs to come into play,"" Gonzalez told Reuters.""All of the
provisions of the WTO are more concerned with imports and
whatever you have on export restrictions is very limited.""
 Indonesia's trade minister, Mari Pangestu, agrees. The huge
Indonesian archipelago is Southeast Asia's biggest economy and
is a major commodity producer. But as well as growing rice, it
imports the staple to ensure steady food supplies and keep
prices down for its millions of poor.
 Indonesia is one of the promoters of the special safeguard
mechanism -- an instrument that would allow developing countries
to raise tariffs temporarily to block a flood of food imports
that could hurt their local farmers.
 Pangestu, a respected economist, says the current high level
of food prices does not invalidate the proposal. ""Commodity
prices have a way of up quickly and also going down quickly.""
 Financial investment in commodities has fuelled this
volatility and created uncertainty for farmers.
 The long-term answer must include better investment in
agriculture, not least to deal with the impact on production of
climate change, rural credit, and hedging possibilities for
farmers through well-functioning futures markets, she said.
 But export restrictions need to be looked at too.
 ""We have to have a balanced discussion on this. A country's
need to safeguard their stocks, that's a given. How do they do
it in a way that doesn't lead to an impact on global markets?""

* Negotiators instructed to make the necessary compromises

(Recasts with comments from ministers)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Two dozen trade
ministers agreed on Saturday to make a final push for a new
trade deal, ordering their officials to do what it takes to make
the necessary compromises.
 World Trade Organization members had been intensifying
efforts to finally clinch a deal in the decade-old Doha round
after the G20 said 2011 was a window of opportunity to reach
agreement.
 Negotiators at WTO headquarters in Geneva have been waiting
for ministers meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic
Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos to give a clear signal
that they should make the necessary concessions and trade-offs.
 ""There is unquestionably a renewed sense, in some people of
urgency, in some people optimism, but ... we have yet to see
substantial progress,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said.
 ""But we do think there is a different negotiating dynamic,""
he told Reuters in an interview.
 Ministers acknowledged that there were still big differences
to overcome to agree a new set of rules opening up trade in
food, industrial goods and services that would boost the global
economy and strengthen defences against protectionism.
 But they said they were telling officials to negotiate in a
spirit of give-and-take to produce a deal each can sell at home.
 ""There will be demands from all sides in the final lap and
if demands are made then there has to be reciprocity,"" Indian
Commerce Minister Anand Sharma told reporters.
 Saturday's meeting did not get into specific issues but was
more about the negotiating process.
 
 DIFFERENCES
 Even here there were some differences.
 EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said ministers had
agreed to reach an outline agreement by July. U.S. trade chief
Kirk said there had been no agreement on timing. A statement
from the Swiss government, that hosted Saturday's talks, said
overall agreement was needed by July.
 The talks have staggered on since their launch in late 2001
to open world markets and help poor countries benefit from
trade. But officials say there is a new sense of hope this time
and WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy told a news conference a
deal was possible this year if talks accelerate further.
 Washington is calling on the big emerging countries like
China, India and Brazil to open their markets more to foreign --
including American -- businesses as a reflection of their
growing economic clout.
 Emerging economies argue that the deal is largely in place,
based on the last intensive spate of negotiations in 2008, and
if Washington wants more it must pay with further concessions of
its own.
 The United States drew support from the EU on Saturday, with
De Gucht telling reporters that the state of negotiations in
2008 was only a starting point, and an unbalanced one at that,
with much unfinished business.
 Washington believes that even from a development standpoint,
the best opportunities for poorer countries will come in the
emerging economies, as U.S. tariffs are already so low that
further cuts can offer only incremental benefits, while the
emerging economies are growing faster than rich nations.
 According to one official, Peru, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Costa Rica all spoke up on Saturday calling for a deal that
would promote more South-South trade.
 The challenge will be to find a deal that gives everyone the
benefits they seek without causing too much pain to farmers or
workers in sensitive industries.
 Whatever the exact timing, all agree that to reach a deal
this year, perhaps with a formal signing at the WTO's
ministerial conference in December, negotiators will have to
work intensely over the next few weeks to produce revised drafts
of an agreement by late April or so.
 Further work to narrow the gaps would let ministers meet
before the European summer break and try to resolve a few
remaining issues in a series of last-minute trade-offs.
 That would not form a final agreement, but the broad
outlines of a deal, such as formulas for cutting tariffs, and
major exceptions to that, leaving the rest of the year for
negotiators to fill in the details.
 New difficulties can always arise. Brazil's Foreign Minister
Antonio Patriota, possibly opening a can of worms, told the
meeting negotiators needed to consider the impact of exchange
rates on trade.
 But ministers believe that this may now be the last chance
to reach a deal, and failure to do so would not only kill the
negotiations but hurt the system of trading rules umpired by the
WTO.
 ""Either we do it this year or we get into real trouble,"" De
Gucht said.

 * Positive change in relations with China

(Recasts, adds quotes, details, background, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The United States
hailed a new tone in negotiations for a global trade agreement
on Saturday, but said it had yet to see substantive progress in
the decade-old Doha round.
 U.S. officials say they have worked hard to inject new
realism into the Doha talks which have stalled repeatedly since
their launch in late 2001 but have recently taken on new life.
 ""There is unquestionably a renewed sense, in some people of
urgency, in some people optimism, but ... we have yet to see
substantial progress,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said.
 ""But we do think there is a different negotiating dynamic,""
he told Reuters in an interview.
 Kirk was talking after two dozen trade ministers, meeting on
the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, agreed to
push for an outline deal in the Doha talks and instruct their
negotiators to make the necessary compromises to reach it.
 One of the obstacles to a deal in the past few years was a
difference between the United States and big emerging economies
like China, Brazil and India over the role they should play in
opening up markets.
 Washington argues that the growing economic clout of the
emerging economies means they have a duty to provide more
opportunities for exporters from other countries, while the
emerging countries say they have already offered enough in a
negotiation that is supposed to benefit developing nations.
 
 CHINA
 The U.S.-Chinese relationship -- bedevilled by differences
from defence to currencies -- is the key both to the Doha talks
and other geopolitical issues. 
 Kirk said this relationship had evolved significantly.
 ""It does feel like there has been a demonstrable and
positive change in the tone of our engagement with our
colleagues from China,"" he said.
 This did not mean that China had made the trade commitments
that the United States was seeking. ""But we have a much more
positive environment for that conversation,"" he said.
 Kirk repeated his view that the best prospects in the Doha
round for increased trade for poorer countries lay with emerging
economies.
 This was because U.S. tariffs were already very low and any
changes agreed in Doha could make only an incremental
difference.
 ""One of the real opportunities for some of the least
developed economies is going to be in trade with these emerging
new market powers,"" he said.
 One official familiar with the talks at Saturday's meeting
said that ministers from four developing countries -- Peru,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Costa Rica -- had spoken up for the need
for more South-South trade.
 The reduction and abolition of agricultural subsidies in
rich countries was one of the core goals of the Doha talks when
they were launched, and the United States and European Union are
still expected to make big cuts in an eventual deal.
 Kirk said growing world demand for food, as populations rise
and diets in many poorer countries change with rising
prosperity, meant there would be plenty of demand in future for
the goods of agricultural exporters, rich and poor.
 But the need to attack the U.S. budget deficit was certain
to put the spotlight on farm support when lawmakers discuss the
news U.S. farm bill in 2012, he said.

 * Few problems still to solve
 * U.S. representative says 95 percent of issues solved
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia could conclude
protracted negotiations and join the World Trade Organisation
this year, Director-General Pascal Lamy said on Saturday.
 ""I believe Russian accession to the WTO before the end of
this year is doable,"" Lamy told a news conference on the
sidelines of the World Economic Forum after a meeting of 24
trade ministers in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said the country
-- the largest economy outside the WTO -- hopes to join the
153-member trade body in 2011 after 17 years of negotiations.
 ""Doable does not mean done but obviously Prime Minister
Putin and (President Dmitry) Medvedev the last year have been
pushing on the gas pedal and as a result of that the process has
been moving on very substantially,"" Lamy said.
 Russia cleared one major hurdle to joining the body in
December when the European Union -- Moscow's biggest trading
partner -- endorsed its bid largely thanks to Moscow's
commitments to phasing out export tariffs on timber.
 ""We know we still have a few problems to solve...,"" Lamy
said.
 The World Bank has estimated WTO entry could increase the
size of Russia's $1.2 trillion economy by as much as 3.3 percent
in the medium term and 11 percent in the long term. 
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk told Reuters that
negotiations had been going spectacularly well and said
President Barack Obama was keen to see Russia join the WTO.
 ""We have resolved 95 percent-plus of our outstanding issues
in terms of Russia's accession,"" Kirk said.
 Among the issues Russia still has to resolve with its
partners are farm subsidies, treatment of state-owned companies,
and intellectual property.
 Under WTO rules every member has an effective veto on
accessions and so a candidate for membership must negotiate
bilaterally with any country that wants it, as well as a broader
working group of members set up to handle each accession.
 The discussions had now moved to the broader working group
-- where another round of negotiations took place this week --
and Kirk said he believed Russia's bilateral talks with other
countries were also making progress.

 * Policymakers at odds over tackling inflation, imbalances
 
 By Paul Carrel
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Even after their
annual Alpine get-together, global policymakers cannot agree
which of the risks facing the world economy are most pressing
let alone decide how to tackle them.
 While there was broad agreement that the worst of the euro
zone debt crisis has passed, countless panel discussions and
bilateral meetings at the World Economic Forum in Davos did
little to narrow differences of opinion over the threat of
inflation to the global recovery and the imbalances associated
with deficits and exchange rates.
 The financial crisis forced policymakers to look into the
abyss and work together to prevent the global economy going into
meltdown. The recovery is seeing countries operating more
independently.
 ""At the early stages of the financial crisis, at G20 level,
there was a lot of talk of coordination ... I think now
everybody is going their own way,"" Turkish Finance Minister
Mehmet Simsek said during one of the Forum's panel discussions.
 ""That's an issue, that's a problem,"" he said. ""Global
imbalances are there, probably to grow.""
 Turkey is one of a growing number of emerging market nations
that have acted to stem ""hot money"" inflows destabilising their
economies. Asian and Latin American nations have done the same,
pointing the finger at the United States for flooding the world
economy with newly-printed money.
 Much of the problem is disagreement over prioritising risks
and not just between rich and emerging nations.
 Take price pressures: the United States and France are both
leading Western economies with low inflation rates -- running at
1.5 percent and 2.0 percent respectively -- and yet they see the
threat posed by rising commodity costs very differently.
 ""I would not put inflation on a global level on the high
list of concerns,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
said, instead stressing a need to improve financial oversight.
French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde saw things
differently: ""I think we should all be concerned about the risk
of rising inflation as a result of raw materials prices,"" she
told Reuters Insider. ""We'd better watch out.""
 The inflation debate masks deeper divisions about the
imbalances in the world economy, centred on a rift between the
United States and China.
 Washington wants Beijing to let its yuan currency rise, a
development Geithner said would help China manage the
inflationary challenges that come with rapid growth. Yuan
appreciation would also help lift U.S. exports to China.
 But China, whose economy continues to zoom, is concerned
loose U.S. monetary policy will weaken the dollar, hitting its
U.S. Treasury holdings and potentially destabilising its economy
by choking back its exports.
 ""I'm worried about whether China's reserves value will
evaporate,"" said Yu Yongding, a former People's Bank of China

 COMMODITY BUBBLES
 China's concerns are shared by other fast-growing economies
where rising interest rates are drawing in capital from
investors hunting for higher-yielding bonds or commodity assets.
 Columbia professor of economics Joseph Stiglitz said
ultra-loose U.S. policy was throwing the world into imbalance as
the Federal Reserve pumps $600 billion into the U.S. economy.
 ""The liquidity in the United States isn't going to reignite
the American economy,"" he told Reuters Insider.
 ""It's looking around the world ... it's going to emerging
markets that don't need it and it's fuelling these bubbles. The
irony is that it might come back and ricochet on the United
States through higher commodity prices,"" he said.
 A weaker currency helps a country's exporters, which is why
Washington wants the yuan to appreciate and why some other
policymakers have bridled at the U.S. policy, which they see as
a means of depressing the dollar to helping U.S. manufacturers.
 ""The problem is that not everyone can have a weak currency
simultaneously,"" said Niall Ferguson, a Harvard professor who
specialises in economic history. ""In this game of competitive
devaluation, it's very clear that the Chinese are winning.""
 Policymakers made little progress at a Davos session on
redesigning the global monetary system, participants said.
 Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer recalled how in the
autumn of 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis, it
was easy to coordinate policy ""because every country agreed to
expand fiscal policy"".
 ""Now we're at a stage where some people have, in essence, to
forego some growth in order that others may grow a bit faster,""
he said. ""Getting coordination on that is a totally different
sort of problem and much harder to solve, and that includes the
problem of global imbalances.""
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy has some lofty goals for
his chairmanship of the G20 group this year. Davos suggests he
has much work to do.

 * Volatility but no systemic crisis seen
 * EU could stretch Greek, Irish loan repayments-sources
 
 By Paul Taylor
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - European policymakers
and international bankers at the Davos forum said on Saturday
the euro zone's debt crisis had turned a corner and any doubt
about the survival of the single currency area had passed.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a World
Economic Forum panel he did not expect the 17-nation euro zone
to suffer any further major crises. Member states were drawing
lessons and moving towards convergence in their economic and
social policies.
 ""I don't expect that there will be further major shocks,""
Schaeuble said. ""I think the euro will be stable.""
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde urged financial
markets not to short-sell the euro zone, saying all countries
were on the right path to fiscal consolidation.
""I think the euro zone has turned the corner,"" she told the
same panel. ""Let's not short Europe and let's not short the euro
zone.""
 Bankers voiced confidence that European Union leaders would
take decisive steps in the coming weeks to support euro zone
states in difficulty, coupled with tough austerity measures and
structural economic reforms.
 Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, who spoke for major
banks following their meeting with finance ministers and
regulators earlier on Saturday, said the euro's survival was no
longer in doubt.
 ""The question of whether the euro is going to stay together
is last year's issue and it's off the table,"" he said. ""We're
still going to see some volatility but the big question of
whether the euro is going to survive is off the table.""
EU leaders are aiming for a comprehensive package in March
expected to include an increase in the lending power of their
rescue fund and more flexibility in how it can be used, longer
repayment periods and lower interest rates on bailout loans to
Greece and Ireland, tougher fiscal discipline rules with better
enforcement, and specific commitments to structural reforms.
 Euro zone sources said on Friday a special summit could take
place in early March.
 
 DEBT BRAKE
 Two euro zone sources told Reuters on Friday that German
central bank chief Axel Weber had suggested extending the Greek
and Irish rescue loans to 30 years from three and seven years
respectively, which could help both countries avoid
restructuring their debts to the private sector.
 Germany is pushing its euro zone partners to adopt binding
national fiscal rules similar to its ""debt brake"" constitutional
amendment which forces the government to slash its deficit.
 Diamond said he expected there would still be tension on
bond markets because of the problems of individual euro zone
countries, but there was no longer a systemic danger.
 ""I don't think volatility in the markets has gone. But what
was an acute issue a year ago is at worst a chronic issue
today,"" he said, citing the political commitment from euro zone
leaders to defend their currency.
 British finance minister George Osborne, a eurosceptic whose
government has vowed never to join the euro, said Europe was
doing two out of three things right.
 ""The euro zone themselves are working flat out on a
permanent stability mechanism. The UK has a huge interest in
seeing that succeed and we're contributing in terms of providing
technical expertise,"" he told the same panel.
 ""Individual countries are putting their own houses in order.
Countries like Portugal and Spain are taking difficult decisions
to address the problems,"" he added.
 However, Osborne said the EU needed ""one more heave"" to
drive forward further liberalisation of its internal market and
make Europe a more competitive place to do business.
 Much of the debate on solutions to the euro zone crisis has
focused on increasing the size and effective lending capacity of
the 440 billion euro European Financial Stability Facility and
giving it the power to buy sovereign bonds or give countries
flexible credit lines before they lose access to credit markets.
 Germany no longer appears to rule this out categorically but
wants to focus the negotiation on its demands for tougher fiscal
discipline and reforms of labour markets, pension and education
systems.
 In a newspaper interview released on Saturday, Schaeuble
criticised talk of expanding the EFSF.
 ""Those who focus the debate on this question prevents us
from coming to a sustainable package solution,"" he said in
advance excerpts of the Wirtschaftswoche business magazine.
 ""It is not sensible to address the matter only in terms of
whether the fund should be increased, or made so that its
resources can be better deployed,"" he added.
 Schaeuble and Chancellor Angela Merkel have in the past
ruled out increasing the size of EFSF, wary in a year with seven
regional German elections of alienating taxpayers fed up with
being a backstop for the euro zone.
 They are focusing instead on finding ways to maximise the
full capacity of the EFSF, whose effective lending clout is
really only about 250 billion euros because of the guarantee
system required to maintain its triple-A credit rating.

 * Banks not to blame for franc strength -UBS chairman
 
 ZURICH, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Swiss Economy Minister Johann
Schneider-Ammann backed the leadership of the Swiss National
Bank in a newspaper interview on Saturday after calls for SNB
chief chief Philipp Hildebrand to step down.
 The SNB had done everything it could to stem the rise of the
Swiss franc through currency market interventions, Schneider
Amman told Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
 ""It is cheap 12 months later to point a finger at the
decision taken at the time and to say the leadership did
everything wrong,"" Schneider-Amman was reported as saying.
 ""No, it did the best thing possible and I have complete
trust in the competency of the national bank and its
leadership.""
 Top Swiss National Bank policymakers last week defended the
currency interventions during the financial crisis, trying to
fend off harsh criticism of the huge losses which have led to
pressure for Hildebrand to go. [ID:nLDE70Q0B2]
 The franc gained more than 15 percent against the euro last
year and is trading near a recent record high, but the central
bank has not stepped in to curb the franc since June.
 Economists do not expect it to resume interventions as the
economy is posting robust growth and the SNB ran up a loss of 21
billion francs as the value of its euro holdings plunged.
[ID:nLDE70D1ZH]
 The chairman of UBS said claims Switzerland's big banks were
driving up the franc were ""absurd"" and also denied they were
undermining Hildebrand.
 ""The market share of the Swiss banks in franc trading is
around 5 percent globally. UBS has no influence on the exchange
rate,"" Kaspar Villiger said in a separate NZZ interview.
 ""It has been alleged over again that the big banks are
criticising the national bank and its chief. This is not the
case. It is about a constructive dialogue about a problem.""
 Hildebrand said on Thursday the strong franc is hurting
exporters in Switzerland and will slow growth this year,
although some in its economy are benefiting from the currency's
rise. [ID:nLAD005152]

 * Seven key players agreed to push for outline deal by July
 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Two dozen trade
ministers met on Saturday to review progress on finishing the
Doha round after seven major trading powers agreed to push for a
deal in the decade-old talks by July.
 The trade ministers' lunch, a traditional fixture hosted by
the Swiss government on the sidelines of the World Economic
Forum in Davos, is taking place as World Trade Organization
members intensify efforts to finally clinch a deal.
 Negotiators at WTO headquarters in Geneva, who have stepped
up the pace of talks in recent weeks, have been waiting for
ministers in Davos to give a clear signal that they should make
the necessary concessions, compromises and trade-offs.
 Seven key players agreed on Friday to do just that and push
for an outline agreement by the summer.
 ""Everybody agrees we should try to do this for July,"" EU
Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told reporters late on Friday.
 ""We don't have an agreement tonight -- you have an agreement
when you have an agreement. But everybody has engaged to do
this,"" he said, speaking after the EU hosted a dinner for
ministers from Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan and the
United States.
 
 LAST CHANCE?
 Leaders of the G20 summit called in Seoul last year for a
deal and said 2011 represented a window of opportunity, which
many negotiators and economists believe could be the last.
 The talks have staggered on since their launch in late 2001
to open world markets and help poor countries benefit from
trade.
 But officials say there is a new sense of hope this time.
 Trade is moving up the agenda in the United States as
President Barack Obama's administration prepares to take
free-trade pacts with South Korea and Colombia to Congress.
 Washington is calling on the big emerging countries like
China, India and Brazil to open their markets more to foreign --
including American -- businesses as a reflection of their
growing economic clout.
 The emerging economies argue that the deal is largely in
place, based on the last intensive spate of negotiations in
2008, and if Washington wants more it must pay with further
concessions of its own.
 But behind the public posturing is a clear recognition that
the final phase of talks will require give and take by everyone.
 The question now is whether everyone can make the
concessions that will allow their partners to sell a deal to
their voters.
 Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu said everyone had
domestic political concerns that needed to be respected, but
countries should look at the benefit to the global economy of a
new trade deal, not just their national concerns.
 ""You've got to be clear where your bottom line is and then
you go into the negotiations with a give-give kind of attitude,""
she told Reuters.
 De Gucht said ministers would tell their officials they must
do what it takes to negotiate a deal, leaving just a few key
political issues for ministers to handle in the final stage.
 July would not be a final agreement, but the broad outlines
of a deal, such as formulas for cutting tariffs, and major
exceptions to that, leaving the rest of the year for negotiators
to fill in the details.
 That would still make it possible to meet the G20 call, with
the complete agreement wrapped up at the WTO's ministerial
conference in December. But the timetable would be tight.

 * Sees tiny chance of currency or trade war
 * Unreasonable to ask China to boost yuan due to surplus

(Adds details, quotes, background, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn and Lee Chyen Yee
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - China has no need to
revalue its yuan currency for trade reasons, as export growth
will slow to a still strong 10 percent this year and its surplus
is set to contract by 2015, its trade chief said on Friday.
 Imports from the world's second largest economy will
probably grow faster than exports this year, Commerce Minister
Chen Deming said.
 Chen dismissed calls for China to strengthen the yuan to
tackle the trade surplus, and called instead on countries with
reserve currencies -- a reference to the United States -- to
prevent their currencies from weakening.
 ""It is not a sound argument to ask China to appreciate the
yuan for trade reasons,"" Chen told Reuters in an interview
during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
 In 2010, China posted growth of about 30 percent in exports,
with its factories churning out everything from shoes to steel.
China joined the World Trade Organization 10 years ago -- a
symbol of its opening to the world -- and last year overtook
Germany as the world's biggest exporter.
 China's exports will grow more slowly this year after 2010's
stellar performance because of fragile conditions in its key
markets, Chen said.
 ""There are lots of uncertainties in the global economy now,
such as toxic assets in the United States, Europe's sovereign
debt issue, as well as inflation and rising labour costs in
emerging economies,"" said Chen.
 
 TRADE AND CURRENCIES
 It is therefore paramount for China to maintain a stable
yuan exchange rate to benefit the global economy, he said.
 China's trade surplus is virtually all with one country -- a
reference to the United States -- and if it was excluded, trade
will be more or less balanced, Chen said.
 ""So the trade surplus issue is not because of the level of
exchange rates,"" said the veteran administrator, who draws
inspiration from classical economists Adam Smith and David
Ricardo, and has been commerce minister since 2007.
 Chen said he saw little prospect of a currency or trade war,
but it was necessary to remain alert over exchange rate
tensions.
 Beijing has been allowing the yuan to firm gradually, and it
is likely to hit 6.3 per dollar by the end of 2011, a Reuters
poll showed, from about 6.586 now.
 Chen said a stronger yuan could help counter inflation, but
could also bring other problems in its wake.
 China imports food and raw materials whose prices are
rising, but Chen played down the role of imports in inflation.
 Asked about criticism by foreign businesses of difficult
trading conditions in China, Chen said there was no systematic
industrial espionage in the country and the authorities were
tightening the protection of intellectual property rights.
 Foreign companies were flocking to China in a sign of the
positive business climate, with foreign direct investment
inflows rising 17 percent last year to top $100 billion.
 ""Enterprises are smart. They wouldn't continue to invest for
no reason,"" Chen said.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world
slumped, crude oil prices surged and the dollar gained on
Friday as images of escalating violence and chaos in Egypt
gripped investors and raised concerns the protests will spread
across the Middle East.
 Money managers, who in recent months had been accelerating
moves into riskier assets, dumped stocks and piled into
safe-haven investments like U.S. Treasuries, the dollar and
gold as non-stop media coverage of skirmishes between
protesters and Egyptian police overwhelmed all other news.
 Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index suffered its biggest
one-day loss in six months.
 Some said the sudden eruption of violence could spur a
longer-term sell-off after a strong rally in riskier assets
like stocks and emerging markets.
 ""I think the next two to three weeks, the crisis in Egypt
and potentially across the Middle East might be an excuse for a
big sell-off of 5 percent to 10 percent,"" Keith Wirtz,
president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset
Management in Cincinnati.
 Traders and investors fear the protests could spread across
the oil-rich region and lead to disruptions to Middle East
commerce. Global political pressure could also heat up because
of the security threat posed to Israel by deepening instability
to a key regional ally.
 U.S. crude futures  surged more than 4 percent.

 U.S. Treasury debt, gold and Swiss francs, all traditional

 On Wall Street, shares fell from 29-month highs and the
CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX <.VIX>, a broad measure of market
anxiety, soared 23 percent.
 Disappointing results by high-profile companies, including
Amazon.com and Ford Motor Co, added to the negative sentiment
caused by the turmoil in Egypt.
 Energy stocks declined despite the surge in oil prices as
uncertainty over the weekend developments in Egypt and anemic
growth in Chevron's  oil reserves kept investors
jittery.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 166.13

 Nearly 10 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq, New York

daily average volume of 8.47 billion shares.
 ""The market response to earnings in Microsoft, Amazon and
Ford is disappointing,"" said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist
at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. ""Then you throw in Egyptian

 Benchmark 10-year Treasuries note yields dropped 0.05

safety in U.S. government securities.
 The political unrest overshadowed economic data in the
United States that showed a recovery was on track.

2010 showed the biggest gain in consumer spending in more than
four years, and with strong exports, offered the clearest

 Ford  tumbled more than 13 percent after reporting a
steep drop in its quarterly profit after a charge for debt

Pennsylvania.
 Amazon.com Inc's  revenues missed expectations late
Thursday. Shares of the online retailer fell 8 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 0.95

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and Swiss
franc are likely to hold gains next week should tensions in
Egypt persist, raising concerns about stability in the Middle
East and North Africa and increasing investor demand for safer
havens.
 A slew of economic data and central bank decisions is due
next week, including the U.S. government's closely watched
monthly non-farm payrolls report, but analysts said civil
unrest in Egypt, if not contained, could easily trump macro
fundamentals.
 Both the dollar and Swiss franc rallied on Friday, with the
greenback and franc rising 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent,
respectively, against the euro.
 Emerging market currencies also sold off, led by the
Turkish lira and the Israeli shekel as news reports showed
dozens of people were wounded after police and demonstrators
fought in the streets of Cairo in protests against President
Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule.
 With Egyptian markets closed on Fridays and Saturdays,
investors sold shekels and lira and bought the dollar in a
proxy trade during the unrest.
 Oil futures also surged on the unrest in Egypt, rising 4.3
percent to $89.36 per barrel on fear that prices may continue
spiking from current levels.
 ""This could really encompass the region. Egypt is really
the pivot point in the entire Arab world and has implications
for things like the price of oil,"" said Dan Dorrow, head of
research at FX advisory and execution firm Faros Trading in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""If Monday looks a lot like today, then the political risk
premium will swamp any kind of of central bank and economic
fundamentals and we could see more safe-haven moves to the
Swiss franc.""
 Spot gold also rose on Friday as investors sought
protection from political risk, rising 2.0 percent at $1,337.50
per ounce.
 Next week, the biggest focus will be the release on Friday
of January U.S. employment, with the economy expected to have
created 146,000 jobs in the month. But unless the report shows
a blockbuster number, the dollar is unlikely to gain much from
it.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro fell 0.8 percent to
$1.3615. Earlier it fell as low as $1.3584 on electronic
trading platform EBS, just shy of $1.3570, the 50 percent
retracement of its decline from November to January.
 As the euro's recent rally lost momentum, Goldman Sachs
said in a research note on Friday it closed its long
euro/dollar position, with a gain of about 2.7 percent.
 Goldman's chief FX strategist, Thomas Stolper, however,
said in an e-mail the bank remains constructive on the euro and
expects it to hit $1.40 in three months, $1.45 in six months,
and $1.50 in one year.
 Meanwhile, euro positioning in the latest week remained on
the long side, data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed, as the value of the dollar's short position
rose to the highest in two months.
 The euro fell 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.2826
francs while the dollar dropped 0.4 percent versus the franc to
0.9419.
 In the emerging market world, the dollar rose to a
four-month high against the Israeli shekel, up 1.7 percent at
3.7090. Jitters spread over to the Turkish lira, which fell to
a seven-month low against the greenback. Late afternoon, the
dollar surged 2.3 percent against the Turkish lira to 1.6132.
 The Egyptian pound weakened sharply this week due to the
turmoil, while the Egyptian EGX-30 equity index is down more
than 22 percent from its January peak. With no trading on
Friday, further losses are likely when trading resumes.
 Win Thin, global head of emerging market strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman, said while Egypt has a small economy and no
longer is a major player in oil exports after it turned net oil
importer, it is an important geopolitical player.
 Thin noted that Egypt is only one of two Arab countries
that have signed peace treaties with Israel -- the other being
Jordan -- and therefore the United States considers it as an
important ally in the region.
 Egypt also controls the Suez Canal, through which an
estimated 8 percent of global sea trade travels. ""So clearly,
it is in U.S. and European interests to see a negotiated
solution,"" Thin said.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Investors pushed more cash
into developed market equities and some debt funds in the week
ended Jan. 26, while municipal bonds and commodities suffered
net redemptions, data from EPFR Global showed on Friday.
 Emerging market equities suffered net redemptions on
expectations of faster growth in the United States and Europe,
notwithstanding their deficits, will lead to higher returns.
 Cash came off the sidelines, as a net $6.9 billion moved
out of money market funds.
 Concerns about U.S. state and local government finances
continued for an 11th week. Municipal bond funds had a net
$1.67 billion redeemed in the latest week, a slowing of the
pace from the prior week.
 Investors also fled commodity funds in record fashion as
investors stepped away from their safe-haven status even as
prices for gold and oil remained elevated. Over $1.4 billion
was pulled from equity-focused commodity funds, a record since
EPFR started tracking sectors in early 2000.
 In equities, EPFR reported net inflows of $2.72 billion
while all bond funds together took in $1.77 billion.
 U.S. equity funds had net inflows of $2.6 billion.
 Emerging market equities posted their first week of net
redemptions in the last five of $3.07 billion.
 Global Emerging Market, or GEM funds, had their worst week
in nearly three years, the firm said, reporting net outflows of
$2.3 billion.
 Indonesia's $215 million in net outflows was the worst week
that market has suffered in over a decade.
 Investors will have to wait another week to see what the
downgrade of Japan's credit rating on Thursday does for equity
flows, however.
 In the meantime, investors plowed $617 million into Japan,
marking an eight-week inflow streak that brings year-to-date
inflows over the $1.5 billion mark.
 European equity funds took in $1.26 billion, a 34 week
high. However European bond funds had outflows that bring the

 German and Russian equities led the way in Europe. German

 Africa regional funds took in a net $44 million.
 Latin America however continues to struggle, posting
outflows of $105 million. Investor net redemptions have
occurred for the fifth week out of the last seven.
 China equity fund outflows totaled $226 million. BRIC funds
(Brazil, Russia, India, China) had net redemptions of $184
million, marking a ninth straight week of weakness.
 Deadly protests in Egypt, home to the Middle East's largest
stock market, escalated Thursday and Friday, meaning next
week's data might give a fuller picture of investor sentiment.
However, the latest data shows net selling of Middle East
equities by the funds EPFR tracks hit its highest weekly level
since late September of $16.2 million.

 NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices surged, world
stocks fell and the dollar gained on Friday as images of street
battles in Egypt riveted investors and raised concerns the
protests will intensify and spread across the Middle East.
 President Hosni Mubarak imposed curfews across Egypt.
Investors, who had been accelerating moves into riskier assets,
sold stocks heavily as they reacted to coverage of street
battles between protesters and Egyptian security forces.
 ""The crisis in Egypt as well as the significance of a
government shutting down the Internet for the entire country is
causing major nervousness in market participants that have been
long equities in front of the weekend,"" said Linda Raschke, a
partner with Chicago based brokerage firm FuturePath Trading.
 ""There is a flight to dollars as well as a flight out of
equities. The major benefiting market to the upside is crude
oil, capitalizing on the implications for regional
instability,"" she added.
 U.S. crude futures  surged more than 4 percent.

 Traditional safe-haven investments U.S. Treasury debt, gold

sentiment. Gold prices jumped 2 percent.
 ""Gold is benefiting more than bonds at this particular

 On Wall Street, shares fell from 29-month highs and the

 Disappointing results by high-profile companies, including

caused by the turmoil in Egypt.
 Energy stocks declined despite the surge in oil prices as
uncertainty over the weekend developments in Egypt and anemic
growth in Chevron's  oil reserves kept investors
jittery.

riots possibly spreading ... we're going into a weekend where
anything is possible in Egypt,"" he said.

 Ford  tumbled more than 12 percent after reporting a
steep drop in its quarterly profit after a charge for debt
payments. ""Ford results were pretty ugly,"" said James Dailey,
portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.
 Amazon.com Inc's  revenues missed expectations late
Thursday. Shares of the online retailer fell 8 percent.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and Swiss
franc rallied on Friday, with more gains seen likely, as
tensions in Egypt raised concerns about stability in the Middle
East and Africa, increasing investors demand for safer havens
and prompting them to sell riskier assets.
 Emerging market currencies sold off led by the Turkish lira
 and the Israeli shekel  as news reports showed
dozens of people were wounded after police and demonstrators
fought in the streets of Cairo in protests against President
Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule. For more see

 Oil  likewise surged on the news, rising 4.4 percent
to $89.38 per barrel as investors loaded up on the commodity on
fear prices may continue spiking from current levels. Spot gold
 was up 2.0 percent at $1,337.50 per ounce as investors
sought protection from political risk.
 ""This could really encompass the region. Egypt is really
the pivot point in the entire Arab world and has implications
for things like the price of oil,"" said Dan Dorrow, head of
research at FX advisory and execution firm Faros Trading in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""If Monday looks a lot like today, then the political risk
premium will swamp any kind of of central bank and economic
fundamentals and we could see more safe-haven moves to the
Swiss franc.""
 In early afternoon trading, the euro  fell 0.9
percent to $1.3603, having fallen as low as $1.3584 on
electronic trading platform EBS, just shy of $1.3570, the 50
percent retracement of its decline from November to January.
 As the euro's recent rally lost momentum, Goldman Sachs
said in a research note on Friday that it closed its long
euro/dollar position, with a gain of about 2.7 percent.
 Goldman's chief FX strategist Thomas Stolper, however, said
in an email the bank remains constructive on the euro and
expects it to hit $1.40 in three months, $1.45 in six months,
and $1.50 in one year. For more see [ID:nN28128424].
 The euro fell 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.2824

the franc to 0.9419 .
 In the emerging market world, the dollar rose to a
four-month high against the Israeli shekel, up 1.7 percent at
3.7090. Jitters spread over to the Turkish lira, which fell to
a 7-month low against the greenback. Early afternoon, the
dollar surged 2.3 percent against the Turkish lira to 1.6132.

 * Gulf still offers favourable investment climate, he says
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Investors should not
lump Egypt and other Middle Eastern markets together in one
group as strong fundamentals especially in the Gulf argue for a
favourable investment climate, a top Qatar regulator said.
 Emerging stocks fell and debt insurance costs across the
Middle East and North Africa -- both categorised as a frontier
market -- surged on Friday as jitters over political unrest in
Egypt spilled into the broader region.
 Even in Saudi Arabia, dollar/Saudi one-year forwards hit
their highest in two years, reflecting expectations of a fall in
the Saudi riyal currency in 12 months' time.
 ""You should not lump everything in frontier markets in the
same latitude with areas (of instability),"" Philip Thorpe,
chairman and chief executive of Qatar Financial Centre
Regulatory Authority told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Investors are sufficiently intelligent to understand the
distinction between North Africa and the Gulf. It's rather
foolish to call the impact of the current events on the broader
region,"" he said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.
 The economy of Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas
exporter, grew more than 20 percent in the third quarter from a
year before.
 ""In Qatar we're looking at growth of 20-plus percent in GDP.
That's a factor that rational investors are attuned to. They are
very much aware of the stability of the state in the Gulf
especially Qatar,"" he said.
 The Gulf Arab state is expected to spend $100 billion over
the next five years on infrastructure projects including road
and rail networks planned before it was chosen as host of the
2022 soccer World Cup, as well as air-conditioned stadiums.
 Qatar returned to inflation in December and prices are now
expected to rise to around 3 percent this year. ""We've seen the
impact of inflation in the past few years and the government is
very alert to the dangers of inflation,"" Thorpe said.
 ""When you have growth running at double digits..., there
will be some squeezes and oversupply cycles. The government will
pay attention to potential for limited supply driven
inflationary effects.""

images of street battles in Egypt riveted investors and raised
concerns the protests will intensify and spread across the
Middle East.
 President Hosni Mubarak imposed curfews across Egypt as

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2011 12:08PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Protests and Egypt's financial markets," Jan 28 (Reuters) - Egypt's financial markets have been
badly shaken since the biggest anti-government demonstrations of
President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule broke out on Tuesday.
 Here are some facts about the main markets:

 THE EGYPTIAN POUND
 The Egyptian pound, which weakened to a six-year low after
two days of protests, is entirely convertible, but the central
bank tightly manages its movements against the dollar with a
view to maintaining stability, allowing it to fluctuate
gradually to reflect demand and supply. Currency traders say the
bank often intervenes indirectly to maintain the currency at
preferred levels via two commercial banks, Suez Canal Bank
, which receives dollar receipts from the Suez Canal
Authority, and Arab African International Bank, whose capital is
partly held in dollars. Traders say the central bank made a rare
direct intervention in December 2009 to keep the currency from
weakening below 5.70 to the dollar, but there has been no sign
of direct intervention since the current protests began. It
weakened to 5.855 on Thursday, the last trading day before the
Egyptian weekend.
 The pound would come under particularly strong pressure if
foreign and Egyptian investors were to accelerate the sale of
their equity and treasuries holdings. One trader in the treasury
room of a bank said several business executives had transferred
funds abroad. Some of Egypt's leading businesses executives have
close links to the ruling party.
 
 THE EGYPTIAN STOCK EXCHANGE
 Egypt's benchmark index of 30 shares <.EGX30> tumbled 7
percent in four days after Tunisia's president was ousted from
power, then fell another 16 percent in two days following the
outbreak of protests in Egypt on Tuesday. Because of its
relatively large size and sophistication, Egypt is heavily
weighted in many investment funds dedicated to the Middle East
and Africa, which tend to invest in a handful of blue chips such
as Orascom Construction Industries  and Commercial
International Bank . Local retail investors, who tend
to invest more speculatively and in smaller companies, are
particularly well represented in the market, and in the days
since the Tunisian president's ouster the more broadly based
index of 100 shares <.EGX100> has tumbled even faster than the
main index, losing 29 percent.
 
 GOVERNMENT FIXED INCOME
 Holdings of treasury bills by foreigners soared over the
past year as investors took advantage of a flood of cheap
dollars to buy Egyptian government paper, especially shorter
term T-bills that carry yields of around 9 or 10 percent. As of
the end of November, foreigners held 61.30 billion Egyptian
pounds ($10.5 billion) worth of the country's 274 billion
Egyptian pounds in outstanding bills. Analysts say the lack of
an active secondary market has dampened the appetite for
government paper, especially longer maturities, forcing the
government to add a risk premium that has pushed up its cost of
funding. The development of secondary trading has been hindered
by rules that allow only 15 commercial banks to buy treasury
bills and bonds directly from the government, an arrangement
that has allowed them to use their deposits to sit on easy and
traditionally risk-free sovereign debt [ID:nLDE6670ZF]. The
government also had treasury bonds worth 199.2 billion pounds
outstanding as of the end of November, with various maturities
of up to 20 years.
 It is too early to gauge the impact on treasury bills, which
many investors hold to maturity, but an increased yield of 40
basis points to an average of 10.62 percent at an auction of
182-day bills on Thursday suggests the central bank is having to
pay more to attract buyers.

 CORPORATE BONDS
 Only a handful of Egyptian firms -- Mobinil , Ezz
Steel , GB Auto  and Orascom Construction
Industries (OCIC.CA> -- have bonds outstanding, and these trade
infrequently. The government has taken a number of steps over
the past year to make it easier to issue bonds, including the
simplification of the regulatory process and the introduction of
a rule allowing corporations to issue bonds in batches.
[ID:nLDE60R27K]
 
 CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
 The cost of insuring Egyptian debt against default jumped
after demonstrations began on Tuesday. During the crisis
Egyptian five-year credit default swaps (CDS) have risen to 405
basis points, the highest since April 2009, data from Markit
showed on Friday. They traded at 320 bps on Jan 17.

 * Needs support of over 70 percent of independent
shareholders
 * Fund managers split on issue, many yet to decide
 
 By Wojciech Moskwa and Joachim Dagenborg
 OSLO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Telenor is preparing for possible
legal action to block Vimpelcom's $6 billion bid to expand its
telecoms empire outside Russia now that an attempt to build
shareholder opposition looks doomed.
 Reuters talked to five independent Vimpelcom shareholders.
Their responses indicated a potential split that would leave the
Norwegian company short of the support it needs at a vote due on
March 17.
 Telenor, with 36 percent of Vimpelcom, needs backing from
more than 70 percent of independent shareholders to be certain
it can block the self-styled Russian telecoms champion's Wind
Telecom takeover deal.
 Aside from the shareholder views, sources familiar with the
situation and analysts expect the vote to go the way of the
Russian company and its top shareholder, a company controlled by
Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.
 ""We are evaluating our legal options,"" Telenor spokesman Dag
Melgaard told Reuters, adding no decision has been taken on how
best to fight what Telenor sees as ""dirty tricks"" by the deal's
proponents.
 A takeover of Wind is backed by Vimpelcom management, the
Russian government, and Fridman's Altimo group.
 The deal with Egyptian tycoon Naguib Sawiris would give
Vimpelcom control of mobile group Orascom and Wind Italy and
make it one of world's largest mobile operators. Sawiris gets a
30.6 percent Vimpelcom stake in return.
 But it comes with risks, including lack of clarity over
Sawiris's prized Algerian unit, and it threatens to reignite a
long-running conflict between Telenor and Altimo.
 ""It seems it is all over for Telenor in terms of (blocking
the bid at) the general meeting,"" said Arild Nysaether, an
analyst at broker Fondsfinans.
 ""They need support from so many (owners) that it will be a
very difficult task, and Altimo has a track record of mobilising
shareholder support.""
 Telenor has 36 percent of Vimpelcom's voting stock while
Altimo owns 44.7 percent. To be certain of rejecting the bid for
Wind, Telenor must be backed by 72 percent of the remaining
shareholders, who jointly own 19.3 percent of votes.
 ""From what we are hearing, many Vimpelcom investors express
a negative attitude to the Sawiris deal,"" said Telenor's
Melgaard. As it weighs litigation, he said, Telenor will contact
Vimpelcom shareholders to urge them to vote down the proposal.
 But Kaha Kiknavelidze, managing partner of London emerging
markets fund manager Rioni Capital, said his fund was in favour.
 ""The deal allows the company to expand outside of Russia at
a time when asset prices are still depressed,"" he said. ""It also
allows Vimpelcom to leverage up and take advantage of the
environment of very low borrowing costs.""
 Telenor said it saw ""dirty tricks"" in Vimpelcom and Altimo
tactics to circumvent a shareholders agreement that would
otherwise allow Telenor to take part in the share issue to
Sawiris -- an issuance that will dilute its influence.
 If the deal is approved, Sawiris will receive 30.6 percent
of Vimpelcom voting stock and reduce Telenor's holding to 25
percent, Altimo's to 31, and all others to a joint 13.4 percent.
 
 LOOPHOLE
 Analysts said Telenor may focus potential legal action on
Vimpelcom's treatment of Wind Telenor as a ""related party"",
after entities controlled by Gleb Fetisov, an indirect minority
shareholder of Altimo, acquired 0.7 percent in Orascom.
 Vimpelcom said this changed the transaction into a ""related
party"" M&A transaction from a ""foreign party"" one, thereby
depriving Telenor of pre-emptive rights on the share issue.
 The share issue would put Telenor dangerously close to
falling below a 25-percent ownership threshold. That would
dissolve a shareholders agreement with Altimo which gives
Telenor three seats on the board and other rights.
 ""Vimpelcom investors have to realise that by allowing the
Sawiris issue to go through, they are effectively putting
themselves in a position where the shareholders agreement
underpinning Vimpelcom's shareholder structure and corporate
governance is a step away from being dissolved,"" Melgaard said.
 ""This will also curb the influence of financial investors.""
 According to the shareholders' agreement, all legal disputes
between shareholders are to be settled in a London arbitration
court according to New York law.
 
 BATTLE FOR INDEPENDENTS
 All three Vimpelcom board members representing ""independent""
minority shareholders voted in favour of the Sawiris deal
earlier this month. The chairman said the deal would help the
company gain bulk and that its terms were good.
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was personally engaged in
trying to secure the Sawiris deal, seen as a major expansion of
a Russian company beyond the country's vast borders.
 Telenor sees unacceptable risk in Sawiris's disputed
operations in Algeria and indebted unit in Italy. Its reasoning
has gained traction among some funds.
 Fredrik Colliander, fund manager at HQ Fund which has a
roughly $22 million Vimpelcom stake, said: ""We are negative
about the whole deal. It creates a lot of uncertainty.""

 * Trade gap doubles; investors wary of more policy measures
 
 (Updates with closing prices)
 By Ayla Jean Yackley
 ISTANBUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira and bonds
slipped after official data showed the trade deficit exceeded
forecasts on Friday, signalling the economy may be overheating
and the central bank could take further measures to slow growth.
 Banks led equities lower as investors bet lenders' profits
will be hemmed in after the central bank implemented new reserve
requirements last week following a surprise interest rate cut.
 The trade deficit widened 75 percent year-on-year in
December to $8.68 billion, the Turkish Statistics Institute
said, exceeding a forecast of $8.15 billion in a Reuters poll.
 The lira closed at 1.590 to the dollar on the interbank
market  and was trading at 1.607 in Monday-dated traded.
It had closed at 1.576 on Thursday. Sales of the lira by
foreigners pushed the currency lower, traders said.
 The lira and bond prices have sagged since the central
bank's rate cut last week, which in turn prompted a further
increase in banks' reserve requirements for lira deposits.
 The trade deficit was ""slightly wide of the consensus, but
double the year-earlier level, as export growth is running at
half that of imports, reaffirming concerns that the economy is
overheating,"" Timothy Ash, an economist at Royal Bank of
Scotland, wrote in an e-mailed note.
 ""(It) will add further pressure on policymakers to work to
slow the economy down -- difficult this side of parliamentary
elections,"" he said.
 Turkey is due to hold a general election this summer, when
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan will seek a third term.
 
 RISK PREMIUM RISES
 Central Bank Governor Durmus Yilmaz has said he is aware of
the impact the bank's recent measures have had on the lira's
exchange rate and that foreigners have sold the currency.
 Risk appetite was sapped by concerns about political
upheaveal in Egypt and weighed broadly on emerging markets,
including Turkish assets, analysts said.
 Credit default swaps, or debt-insurance costs, for Turkey
rose 5 basis points to a four-month high of 159 bps.
 The yield on the benchmark Nov. 7, 2012, bond
<0#TRTSYSUM=IS> rose to 8 percent from 7.91 percent. 
 The main Istanbul share index <.XU100> fell 2.8 percent to
63,211.27, underperforming the MSCI emerging equities index
<.MSCIEF> which fell 1.27 percent.
 Banks <.XBANK>, which make up about 40 percent of the
benchmark index's weighting, slumped 2.99 percent. 
 The busiest shares were Garanti , which slumped
4.08 percent to 7.06 lira, and Isbank , which fell
2.76 percent to 4.94 lira.

country's credit rating.
 The dollar  lost 0.9 percent on the day to 82.18
yen on electronic trading platform EBS, pulling back from a

 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia's trade
minister said on Friday financial speculation has fuelled
volatility in the speculation of commodity prices, as emerging
markets suffer from the threat of rising inflation.
 Food inflation has been gripping emerging economies,
kindling social dissent and threatening to derail economic
growth if not kept in check.
 ""Is it because of supply and demand, or shortages or
imbalances? That's one reason because of the effect of climate
change on production, including natural disasters,"" Indonesian
Trade Minister Mari Pangestu told Reuters Insider.
 ""The other factor is speculation -- financial flows going
into the commodities market sharpening the fluctuation.""
 Indonesia is suspending import duties on rice, soybeans and
what as part of government efforts to fight inflation.
 Analysts are questioning whether the central bank's
reluctance to hike interest rates in the face of rising
inflation could undermine its credibility.
 Pangestu said at the start of the month she expects non-oil
and non-gas exports to grow by 12-15 percent in value this year
as increasing investment in Southeast Asia's biggest economy
expands its manufacturing sector.
 Indonesia coordinates the G33 group of developing country
agricultural producers who want to protect their farmers from
the full impact of opening food markets.
 But fears of inflation and food shortages are forcing it and
other countries to slash barriers to food imports.

 * Euro is on agenda of scheduled end-March meeting
 
 (Adds quotes, details and background)
 By Luke Baker and Andreas Rinke
 BRUSSELS/BERLIN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - European leaders could
hold a special summit in early March to discuss the euro and to
push for a comprehensive reform package in the currency bloc,
euro zone government sources said on Friday.
 It was not clear whether the summit being considered would
involve leaders of euro zone countries or the whole European
Union, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
 Holding such an event could counter allegations of a lack of
urgency among European leaders, who meet next Friday to talk
about energy but are not currently scheduled to take decisions
on measures to resolve the euro crisis until a summit in late
March.
 ""We would be happy to have such a meeting because
preparations on a comprehensive package are not going as rapidly
as some would like, let's put it that way,"" said one source.
 ""There is a sense that the momentum and urgency has
decreased, partly because the market pressure appears to have
diminished, even if that is not really the case,"" added the
source. ""We must not become complacent.""
 EU finance ministers agreed last week to take their time
over beefing up the euro zone's rescue fund, in a go-slow
approach championed by Germany which could test the patience of
investors spooked by the debt crisis. 
 European Commissioner Jose Manuel Barroso warned earlier
this week, ahead of a meeting with German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, that there was a risk of ""procrastination"". This was
seen as a reference to Berlin's rejection of his proposals to
boost the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 
 ""UP THE TEMPO""
 Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann was quoted on Friday as
saying there was a need to inject more urgency into the decision
about increasing the capacity of the EFSF.
 Barroso is campaigning to give greater clout to the fund,
whose effective lending capacity is estimated at just 250
billion euros despite a headline value of 440 billion because of
the guarantee system required to secure a triple-A credit
rating.
 ""The problem must be solved in March, the sooner the
better,"" Faymann told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ""Continual
discussions about this are anything other than helpful.""
 Asked about Berlin's leadership role throughout the crisis,
Faymann said: ""The tempo of decisions in Europe must be higher"".
 ""With the aid for Greece or the question of the euro rescue
fund, people did not know for a while what politicians were
planning,"" he said. ""They rejected that which just shortly later
became an official statement. This is not on, it is confusing.""
 Berlin has repeatedly denied the need to boost the EFSF,
though Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has acknowledged the
need to raise its effective lending capacity, leading to some
confusion about Berlin's position.
 Critics of German policy also say Merkel exacerbated the
European debt crisis by waiting too long to help struggling
countries like Greece, thereby raising the cost of the rescue.
 But her centre-right government would find it politically
difficult to ask Germany's parliament -- and its taxpayers -- to
fund yet more guarantees to bail out euro zone partners in a
year of seven German state elections.
 One new poll out on Friday suggested that while more than
four out of five Germans believe the euro is in danger, a large
majority oppose increasing the bailout fund.

economies like China grow and countries seek to diversify their
monetary holdings, policymakers said on Friday.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing --
essentially printing money -- and a call by France to look at
ways to wean the world off the dollar as the sole reserve money
have put the U.S. currency in the spotlight.
 ""I'm more optimistic about the euro gaining strength as a
potential reserve currency,"" Bank of Israel Governor Stanley
Fischer said during a panel discussion at the annual World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 ""We ourselves are diversifying into currencies which we
would never have put in the reserves before, including the
Australian dollar and so forth,"" he added. ""I think people will
diversify their reserves.""
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy is trying to rally the
Group of 20 powers to the idea of a more varied monetary system
after decades of the dollar being the world's reserve currency
and a major unit of international trade settlement.
 The dollar debate comes at a time when many countries are
tempted to let their currency drop to promote exports and growth
after the worst downturn since World War Two, even if that can
be at each others' expense.
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney and Fischer anticipated
that, in the long run, Asian monies would have a greater role as
reserve currencies.
 ""I agree with Stan (Fischer) that over time there will be
more of a multi-polar system. Other currencies will play a
central role in reserves,"" he said. ""The (Chinese) renminbi,
over time, should have a role as a reserve currency.""
 Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek saw the United
States' quantitative easing policy leading to a diversification
of reserve holdings.
 ""If the U.S. continues the way it is ... certainly countries
will look for alternatives because you can't print so much money
and expect no consequences,"" he said.
 ""Ultimately the centre of gravity is shifting towards the
East,"" Simsek added. ""Certainly, 10 years from now there could
be a very different landscape.""

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2011 09:48AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Investors yearning for clarity," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - After the turmoil of the past
few weeks, investors are yearning for clarity on a broad swathe
of extraordinary issues that have turned this year's assumptions
on their head.
 The question before them is how to absorb and price in the
impact on the global economy of Japan's triple disaster -- with
the threat of nuclear reactor meltdowns the biggest unknown --
as well as increasing violence in energy-rich Arab countries.
 And there is also the festering issue of euro zone debt, due
to come under scrutiny at a European Union Summit at the end of
the week.
In the past week, all of this has meant that stocks have
fallen in a move away from risk, currencies have been agitated
by the prospect of Japanese investors bringing their money home,
oil has bounced back - threatening again to manacle future
global economic growth - and policymakers have become worried.
 It is enough to make some longer-term investors freeze, or
at least not make major moves.
 ""The situation is too fluid and too uncertain to warrant
changes,"" Joost van Leenders, strategist at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, said in a note to clients.
 This has two implications. One is that markets have held up
relatively well over the past week -- relatively, given what has
occurred.
 Equity market losses since the earthquake in Japan on March
11 have been around 2-3 percent, except for Tokyo's 10 percent
fall. Volatilty has risen, but is still far from where it was
during the height of the euro zone debt crisis.
 The second implication of having investors waiting, or at
least not changing plans wholesale, however, is that there is a
large potential for major moves when things become clearer --
possibly in the coming week.
 Equity losses have also been partly restrained by an initial
fall in oil prices.
 That was already being reversed by the United Nations
authorising military attacks on Libya, where forces loyal to
Muammar Gaddafi were closing in on Libyan rebels.
 Libya's pledge to halt its actions will be tested in the
coming week, but Bahrain is also in focus, having cracked down
on mainly Shi'ite Muslim protesters, a move that has angered
Iran and raised tensions in the oil-exporting region.
 
 JAPAN IS THE KEY
 The heart of the uncertainty for investors is what the
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear breakdown will mean for the
world economy and financial markets, and this could well become
clearer in the coming week.
 The initial reaction was that the world economy would cope
quite well, seeing only 0.2 or so trimmed from global growth
that was running at around 4.4 percent.
 But the worsening nuclear crisis and the potential for
Japanese investors to pull money back from world markets (or at
least not put more in), has raised concerns about the impact on
markets even if Japan does manage a V-shaped recovery.
 ""The direct or first round economic effects of the tsunami
are likely to be relatively contained to Japan, but the
financial market spillovers could have very serious global
repercussions,"" Fathom Consulting said.
 Friday's Group of Seven coordinated intervention into
foreign exchange markets to cool the yen was the most vivid
example to date. The yen had been soaring, driven either by
money being repatriated or positioning for it to be.
 Traders are expecting more intervention in the coming week.
 Investors were also becoming more cautious before the
earthquake, partly as a result of the spike in oil. Some see the
disasters in Japan as confirming that trend.
 ""This is a catalyst for a fairly large shake out,"" said
Graham Neilson, chief investment strategist at Cairn Capital,
referring to risk assets as a whole.

 MORE TESTS AHEAD
 Investors, in the meantime, will get a snapshot of how
higher oil prices are playing into various sectors of the world
economy over the coming week.
 Euro zone PMI manufacturing and services flash estimates on
Thursday, for example, will show whether oil prices have led to
a dent in sentiment.
 The split nature of the U.S. economy should also be on view,
with potentially weak housing data expected on Monday and
Tuesday but good durable goods orders on Thursday.
 At the end of the week, the EU summit is set to rubber-stamp
an already agreed but surprisingly strong package of euro zone
crisis measures.
 But the euro zone's highly indebted members have enjoyed
little respite from market pressure since the package was
unveiled, with Portugal facing ever rising borrowing costs.
 Bond investors will be looking for clarity on the welter of
conditions attached to the plan for the EFSF to buy bonds from
the primary market and the timetable for implementation.
 And any sign of delays in implementation or watering down of
the final deal risks triggering a fresh sell-off which might
well sweep across the euro zone periphery.

(Adds more quotes, background)
 By Emma Thomasson and Paul Taylor
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Europe's rescue fund
should be increased in size if needed to tackle the region's
debt crisis, and could be retooled so that it can buy bonds,
French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Friday.
 Lagarde called for the fund to be made more flexible, while
Greece's finance minister said letting his country buy back
government bonds at a discount on the market was worth
considering.
 Those funds could, in theory, be provided by European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), but some northern euro zone
states, including EU powerhouse Germany, oppose such a move.
 Euro zone leaders are discussing ways to strengthen the fund
to show it has enough firepower to support states struggling
with their borrowings, hoping this will ease the debt crisis.
 ""We are working on making the EFSF more efficient, more
flexible, and if it needs to be bigger for that matter, so be
it,"" Lagarde told a news conference at the annual World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner joined a bevy of
European and international executives in voicing confidence that
the European Union was on the road to overcoming the crisis.
 Lagarde said using the rescue fund to buy sovereign bonds
was an idea worth examining.
 ""Buying bonds is one option,"" she told Reuters Insider
television. ""We should look at it. We should weigh the pros and
cons and decide what is most efficient.""
 The fund has a headline value of 440 billion euros but an
effective lending capacity estimated at just 250 billion euros
because of the need to secure a triple-A credit rating.
 The worry is that the fund could be wiped out if a larger
European economy such as Spain needed rescuing. If that happened
the fallout might not remain contained within Europe.
 The challenge is to boost it without raising the headline
sum, which would be difficult to sell politically to Germany's
parliament and public in particular.
 
 GREEK BOND BUY-BACK?
 Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said Greece could
return to the debt market by the end of this year and reiterated
that Athens would not restructure its debt to private creditors.
 Greece became the first euro zone country to receive an
EU/IMF bailout last May, receiving 110 billion euros in loans
after it was shut out of capital markets due to massive debts.
 Asked about buying back Greece's bonds below par,
Papaconstantinou said: ""To do that you need money and so it is
one of the ideas that is being discussed, not officially ...
It's an idea that that deserves some discussion, like others.""
 Lagarde was more equivocal and said Greece should focus on
delivering promised reforms.
 Ministers are considering possible buy-back schemes to allow
the EFSF to buy government bonds or enable Greece to purchase
its own bonds with EFSF money at the heavily discounted
secondary market price and retire them to reduce its debt pile.
 But EU officials say creditors are holding 80 percent of
Greek debt to maturity on their banking books and only 20
percent at ""fair value"" on their trading books, so the take-up
for any buy-back could be limited.
 Papaconstantinou said a comprehensive package of EU measures
to address the euro zone's debt crisis, due to be adopted at a
late-March summit, would help improve market sentiment.
 Greece had begun to put its house in order by reducing its
budget deficit by six percentage points last year to 9.4 percent
but its ability to reduce its debt mountain would depend on its
ability to restore growth and generate primary budget surpluses.
 
 GDP SURPRISE?
 Separately, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said
European Union governments were considering the possibility of
allowing EU financial institutions to recapitalise European
banks that need bolstering.
 Papandreou was asked whether a collective solution at an EU
level to recapitalise banks that needed funds along the lines of
the U.S. TARP programme was under consideration.
 ""These are issues which are being seriously discussed now,""
he replied. ""Who is going to do this if it is necessary? Will it
be the EFSF? Will it be the ECB (European Central Bank)? These
are issues that are on the table.""
 His finance minister stuck to an official forecast of a 3
percent contraction in Greek GDP this year after a 4 percent
fall in 2010, but added: ""Let's see if we can surprise the
market.""
 Athens is committed under its austerity programme to cut its
budget gap to below the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP in 2014.
 Papaconstantinou said he expected the euro zone and the IMF
to agree to stretch out the repayment period for rescue loans
and reduce the interest rate to help make the debt sustainable.
 Greece's public debt stands at 145 percent of GDP and is
projected to peak at 158 percent in 2013, according to EU and
IMF forecasts, a level which many say is unsustainable.

 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Major trading powers
agreed on Friday to push for an outline deal in decade-old trade
talks by July as world leaders appealed for all nations to make
concessions or risk losing the opportunity for years.
 European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the
ministers from seven key economies had also agreed to instruct
officials to negotiate a deal in the Doha round across the board
and leave the trade-offs for ministers to tackle to a minimum.
 ""This is a very clear engagement that the end-game of the
Doha round has now started and that everyone is going to do his
utmost to reach an agreement,"" De Gucht told reporters.
 ""Everybody agreed we should try to do this for July,"" he
said, after hosting dinner for ministers from Australia, Brazil,
China, India, Japan and the United States at a mountaintop
restaurant in the Swiss resort of Davos.
 Earlier British Prime Minister David Cameron told the Davos
World Economic Forum it was ""frankly ridiculous"" that the Doha
round of world trade talks had so far limped on for a decade.
 ""We simply cannot spend another 10 years going round in
circles,"" he said. ""...I call on every world leader to join me.
We've got one last chance to get this right -- 2011 is the make
or break year.""
 Cameron spoke alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and World Trade
Organisation chief Pascal Lamy.

 Members of the WTO had already agreed to intensify the pace
of negotiations after the G20 urged them to use 2011 as a window
of opportunity to reach a deal.
 But negotiators at WTO headquarters in Geneva had been
hoping that ministers in Davos would send a clear signal that
they should now make the necessary compromises to reach a deal
that can be sold to voters in all countries.
 But a warning from the trade ministers of Brazil, India,
China and South Africa ahead of the dinner underlined just how
difficult compromise could be.
 The four ministers said concessions already made by their
emerging economies were not being matched by rich countries, who
were now demanding more, and that such demands jeopardised
efforts to conclude the Doha round.
 Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming told Reuters that
negotiations should be based on what was largely agreed at an
abortive meeting of ministers in 2008, and countries which
wanted more should pay more -- a reference to U.S. demands for
China and other emerging economies to open markets further.
 A broader meeting of about 25 trade ministers plus Lamy will
also review the negotiations on Saturday.
 A report by trade experts presented at Friday's panel
discussion recommended heads of government get personally
involved in reaching a Doha trade deal and set themselves an
end-year deadline to achieve it.
 ""What is already on offer is a package that would provide a
global economic stimulus of hundreds of billions of dollars in
new trade annually,"" the report's preface said.
 ""Everyone would gain"".
 The Doha round was launched in late 2001 to boost the world
economy and help poor countries prosper through trade.
 
 MISSED DEADLINES
 The wide-ranging and complex talks to open up markets for
food, industrial goods and services have missed repeated
deadlines and some negotiators say 2011 will go the same way,
perhaps dooming the negotiations altogether.
 U.S. President Barack Obama showed little interest in a WTO
deal in his first two years in office, mindful of his supporters
in organised labour and their Democratic allies in Congress.
 But in recent months the talks in Geneva have moved up a
gear and some believe the necessary trade-offs are now possible.
 ""There seems to be a general acceptance that what is needed
to bring Doha to a successful conclusion is for the major
countries to bring a little bit more to the table,"" Australian
Trade Minister Craig Emerson told Reuters.
 Emerson said Australia, one of the keenest proponents of a
deal, does not believe that it is the one blocking agreement,
but would consider further concessions as part of a final push.
 ""If it's a matter of the demonstration of good faith and
everyone bringing more to the table then Australia would be a
willing participant in that,""Emerson said.
 Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu and Costa Rican
Foreign Trade Minister Anabel Gonzalez also told Reuters their
countries were willing to take part in the needed give and take.
 ""We have to all come home with a balanced package. And a
balanced package means you've given something but you've also
gained something and there's got to be a net benefit there,""
Pangestu said.
 In the end the deal will require bilateral agreement between
the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies.
 But it is much more complicated than that, with competitive
exporters among the emerging economies wanting to boost
South-South trade by opening markets as well.
 The changing nature of world trade may also make it easier
to open markets by cutting import duties, as global supply
chains mean tariffs amount to a tax on your own business. ""If
you protect imports you will damage your exports,"" World Trade
Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy told reporters.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The yen rose on Friday as demand
from Japanese exporters and speculators helped the currency to
recoup some losses from a broad sell-off triggered the previous
day by a cut to the country's credit rating.
 The euro was steady near a two-month high versus the dollar,
and analysts said the U.S. currency may struggle if growth data
later in the day fails to change the view that Federal Reserve
interest rates are set to remain at rock-bottom levels.
 Analysts said the Standard and Poor's downgrade to AA-
highlighted Japan's fiscal problems and could further sting the
yen, which was being boosted by short-term demand and negative
dollar sentiment.
 ""From a fundamental point of view dollar/yen at 82-83 yen is
too low, but short-term market forces are constantly putting a
drag on,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""The fiscal situation is an ongoing risk for dollar/yen, and
at some point it will correct significantly higher, but now is
not the right time for such a move."" He said speculators were
taking profits on long-term positions to sell the yen.
 Analysts said dollar sentiment would remain sluggish in
light of the U.S. central bank's decision this week to keep
monetary policy unchanged, while indicating it was in no rush to
cut short its economic stimulus measures.
 Investors awaited U.S. GDP data due at 1330 GMT, which is
forecast to show annualised growth of 3.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, up from 2.6 percent in the third.
 The dollar  lost 0.8 percent on the day to 82.20 yen,
pulling back from a rally to 83.22 yen on Thursday. Traders said
a triggering of stop-loss orders around 82.50 yen led the dollar
lower. The yen also advanced against the euro and sterling
 .
 But some in the market said investors are positioning for
yen weakness in the options market, after the bias in dollar/yen
risk reversals continues to creep towards yen puts -- bets the
yen will fall . [ID:nLDE70Q1U8].
 
 HAWKISH ECB
 The euro  held steady against the dollar at $1.3730,
just below a two-month high of $1.3760 hit on Thursday, when a
warning from European Central Bank policymaker Lorenzo Bini
Smaghi on imported inflation fuelled speculation of a euro zone
interest rate rise. [ID:nLDE70Q1EY] 
 Bini Smaghi's hawkish comment added to earlier indications
that the ECB will likely tighten well ahead of the Fed.
 Implied interest rate futures based on overnight index swaps
 are fully pricing in ECB rates at 1.25 percent by
October, compared with their current record low of 1.0 percent.
Fed rates are not expected to rise in 2010 from 0-0.25 percent.
 ""The euro continues to be supported by the hawkish tone
coming from the ECB, with markets now pricing in more than one
full 25 basis point hike by year-end,"" said Tom Levinson,
currency strategist at ING.
 ""Barring a nasty return of sovereign-debt related concern,
the likelihood of the ECB leading the Fed by some distance in
its tightening cycle suggests EUR/USD can rise further.""
 Broad, negative dollar sentiment kept the U.S. currency at
77.685 versus a currency basket <.DXY>, hovering near 77.594 hit
on Thursday, a level last seen in November.
 Analysts expect higher interest rates in other countries
will keep the dollar on its downward trend, but some argue
geopolitical tensions may offer support if political uncertainty
in North Africa triggers risk aversion.
 Investors eyed developments in Egypt, with the Egyptian
pound hitting its weakest in at least six years versus the
dollar  as protestors took to the streets to oppose the
country's authoritarian rule. Earlier this month, a revolt
forced Tunisia's leader to flee the country. [ID:nLDE70Q2OZ]
 ""(Tension in Egypt) could spread to other parts of the
region and that would continue to create uncertainty, providing
a floor for the dollar,"" said Henrik Gullberg, director of
currency strategy at Deutsche Bank.

 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The euro's rally against the
dollar paused near a two-month high on Friday and stocks were
weaker as investors cashed in ahead of U.S. fourth-quarter GDP
numbers.
 Set to end the week in the black, the euro traded flat
against the dollar by 1151 GMT, also giving back some of its
gains against the yen following Thursday's sell-off after
Standard & Poor's cut Japan's sovereign credit rating.
 More broadly, the single currency remains supported by the
European Central Bank's hawkish tone on interest rates, Tom
Levinson, currency strategist at ING, said, with markets now
pricing in more than one 25 basis point hike by year-end.
 ""Barring a nasty return of sovereign debt-related concern
(still likely at some point), the likelihood of the ECB leading
the Fed by some distance in its tightening cycle suggests
EUR/USD can rise further,"" he added.
 The dollar gave up early gains against a basket of major
currencies to trade down 0.1 percent by 1152 GMT.
 Stocks retraced some of their early declines and by 1152
GMT, the benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European
shares was down 0.1 percent, led by mining stocks and remaining
up 0.4 percent on the week.
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street,
after the DJIA closed at a more than 2-1/2-year high on
Thursday.
""We expect equity markets to move into a consolidation phase
in the next couple of months,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, equity
strategist at UniCredit.
 ""People are waiting for the U.S. GDP figures, but it would
only move the market in a big way if the figures significantly
deviate from the consensus.""
 The slight weakness in European shares continued a
broad-based sell-off in Asia overnight, with Japanese stocks hit
by the previous day's S&P sovereign downgrade and other indices
by inflation concerns.
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average ended down 1.1 percent,
while the MSCI world equity index and Thomson Reuters global
stock index were both trading down 0.2 percent by 1153 GMT.
 Emerging market stocks fared worse, falling 0.6 percent.
 The pace of economic recovery in the United States, efforts
to stem the euro zone debt crisis and concerns about building
inflationary pressures continue to guide markets across the
region against the backdrop of the quarterly earnings season.
 Fourth quarter U.S. GDP numbers, due out at 1330 GMT, are
expected to show the world's biggest economy posted the best
quarterly growth since the first quarter of last year, although
unemployment is still seen stubbornly high.
 Figures on Thursday showed positive U.S. housing and factory
data but higher than expected jobless claims.
 
 BUNDS UP, ITALY EYED
 Bund futures rose in early trade, tracking U.S. Treasuries,
and peripheral euro zone spreads widened, with traders eyeing an
auction of Italian debt later in the session.
 Rome plans to auction up to 6.75 billion euros of 2- and
10-year notes, and healthy bid interest would reiterate the
market's willingness to accept more peripheral paper.
 ""Italian supply and U.S. GDP are the pick of the day today,""
a trader said. ""Demand at the Italian auction should be
reasonable. The market may get some concession built in but the
bonds are pretty cheap in that part of the curve.""
 Peripheral spreads over bunds edged wider after a report
Germany was determined to enforce Ireland's bailout terms and
would not support an enlargement of the region's rescue fund.
U.S. Treasuries had traded steady overnight in Asia,
although both the U.S. and Japan were warned to tackle their
debt burden by the International Monetary Fund.
 Spot gold slumped to a four-month low as safe-haven flows
waned in the face of the improving U.S. economic outlook, while
benchmark U.S. crude oil traded up 0.2 percent but remains near
a two-month low.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2011 07:36AM ET</span>","Germans want no bailout fund rise, euro at risk-poll"," BERLIN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - More than four in five Germans
believe the euro is in danger but a large majority oppose
increasing the bailout fund for the single European currency,
according to an opinion poll published on Friday.
 In the survey for broadcaster ZDF, 82 percent of people
believed there was a threat to the stability of the euro zone,
while the minority who did not believe the currency has a bright
future continued to grow steadily, reaching 37 percent.
 There was little support for Brussels' proposals to enlarge
the 440 billion euro European Financial Stability Facility, set
up to defend the euro, with 64 percent opposed to the idea.
 The German government is wary of this proposal from the
European Commission, preferring instead to focus on longer-term
measures to reduce the debt and deficits of euro zone countries.
But Berlin does not rule out increasing the effective lending
capacity of the EFSF as part of a larger crisis package.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right government would
find it politically difficult to ask Germany's parliament -- and
its taxpayers -- to fund yet more guarantees to bail out euro
zone partners in a year of seven German state elections.
 Support for Merkel's conservatives has risen steadily in the
past few months after slumping last year on the euro crisis. In
the ZDF poll their backing rose 1 point to 36 percent, while
that for her unpopular coalition partners, the Free Democrats,
was flat at 5 percent.
 That put the coalition five points behind the 46 percent
support for the combined centre-left Social Democrats and

 * Developed equities outperforming since turn of year
 * Trend encouraged by inflation concerns, valuation shifts
 * Emerging assets still seen as better long-term bet
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A month into 2011, one of the
biggest swings in asset flows has been the outperformance of
previously lagging developed market equities against once
red-hot emerging ones.
 The chances are that this rotation by investors, encouraged
by shifting valuations, inflation concerns and growth spurts in
some developed economies, will remain in place for a while --
perhaps six months -- but it is not likely to become a permanent
fixture.
 Nothing has happened to dilute the overarching view that
emerging markets are a long-term, strategic growth story, albeit
with somewhat heightened political risk -- as is now being seen
in Egypt and Ivory Coast.
 Standard & Poor's cutting of Japan's sovereign debt rating
on Thursday, meanwhile, was a stark reminder that, in contrast
to emerging economies, many developed markets continue suffer
from government bank balance problems.
 But for the time being, the tale of the tape is clear -- the
flows are into developed markets and away from emerging. 
 So far this year, MSCI's developed market stock index
<.MIWO00000PUS> has risen a healthy 3.2 percent -- healthy in
the sense that in the highly unlikely event this rate continues,
developed market stocks would have the best compounded gain in
at least 40 years.
 The benchmark emerging market index <.MSCIEF>, however, is
in negative territory, having fallen more than three quarters of
a percent.
 Individual country indexes show the same pattern. The U.S.
S&P 500 <.SPX> is up more than 3 percent for the year while
India's SENSEX has lost around 10 percent. [ID:nLDE70L0C6]
 The outperformance goes further. On a day-by-day basis last
year, developed markets outperformed emerging markets on just 47
percent of occasions. So far this year, they have done so around
63 percent of the time.
 And in terms of beta, a gauge of how a security reacts to
moves in the market, emerging markets are moving closer to being
in lockstep with developed markets -- meaning that at the moment
there is little to be gained for the extra risk they may carry.
Emerging market beta is currently close to 1.0, compared
with 1.8 about five years ago.

 Graphic on EM/DM performance http://r.reuters.com/qac77r
 Graphic on EM beta changes http://r.reuters.com/cyv67r
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 WHAT GOES AROUND...
 Three things have brought this about and the issue for
investors is how long each will remain a driver.
 First, the popularity of emerging markets has made them a
very crowded trade, meaning that prices have arguably got ahead
of themselves.
 ""They had a good run over the past couple of years and the
valuations are now looking more full,"" said Jason Hepner,
investment director at Standard Life Investments.
 Second, as a result of their recent growth, many emerging
markets are coming up against strong inflationary headwinds
which are prompting central banks to enter a tightening cycle.
 Food price inflation, a growing issue, is likely to have
more impact on emerging markets than on developed ones.
 Credit Suisse estimates that food represents about 34
percent of an Asia ex-Japan consumer price basket. In the United
States, it accounts for less than half that.
Thirdly, some leading developed economics, particularly the
U.S. and Germany, are showing strength.
 Fund flow analysts EPFR Global say that the week up to
January 21 was the sixth of net inflows to U.S. equity funds
that they track out of the past seven, amounting to total net
inflows of $17.3 billion.
 It compares with net $49 billion outflows from the sector in
2010.
 
 SIX MONTHS
 So will it last? The indications are that it won't and that
most of the embrace of developed markets has been tactical, a
short-term move to grab an opportunity.
 Goldman Sachs, for example, has been telling its clients to
emphasis U.S. and Japanese stocks in the first half of the year
and to go back to emerging markets (along with European) in the
second half.
 ""A cyclical slowdown in parts of EM driven by tighter policy
is a concern but the secular trends and the growth leadership of
EM is not in doubt,"" Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman's head of
European portfolio strategy, said in a note.
 There is also a likelihood that some of the factors putting
investors off emerging markets at the moment will reverse.
 William De Vijlder, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, reckons inflation pressures will ease in
emerging markets along with uncertainty about monetary policy,
in part because there is little evidence of China overheating.
 Six months should bring down the cost of emerging market
equities versus developing as well.
 ""The appetite for emerging should pick up again. The
relative valuation should by then have improved,"" he said.
 The trigger may be the developed economies. If they slow --
and U.S. recent data has been disappointing, not to mention
Europe and Japan's fiscal problems -- emerging will start to
look better more quickly.
 If, on the other hand, the U.S. economy takes off, emerging
markets might take a back seat for a bit longer.

 By Natsuko Waki
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - China is making a
progress in balancing its trade position as companies target
domestic consumers, and its trade surplus will fall to $150
billion this year, China's central bank adviser said.
 Data earlier this month showed Beijing's efforts to raise
imports to be bearing fruit -- its surplus with trading partners
narrowed for the second straight year in 2010 to $183 billion
from a peak of $300 billion in 2008.
 Li Daokui, academic adviser to the People's Bank of China,
also said the country's adjustment in nominal exchange rates
would affect general trade but not processed trade, where China
assembles goods made elsewhere and exports them.
 ""It's my personal forecast that trade surplus will go down
to $150 billion... The trade surplus is now just above 3 percent
but it will go down to 2 percent this year and even below 1
percent in 2-3 years,"" Li said on the sidelines of the annual
World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.
 ""We have a labour shortage and the export sector is changing
itself, to sell more domestically... be it fishing, home
appliances or automobile sectors.""
 China has repeatedly pledged to balance its trade account by
importing more, in part due to pressure from trade partners to
pull more weight as a consumer, and as it seeks to reduce its
economic dependence on exports.
Efforts to raise imports are paying off, with China's global
trade surplus narrowing in 2010 for the second straight year
from $196 billion in 2009.
 In a panel discussing China's exchange rate policy at the
Davos forum on Friday, some Chinese panellists clashed with
Washington policy-watchers who urged Beijing to move faster to
strengthen the yuan.
 Yu Yongding, former PBOC adviser and influential economist
in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government
think-tank, said inflationary pressures will likely lead to a
faster rate of appreciation in the yuan.
""China is facing inflationary pressures. It's extremely
rational to have a faster appreciation. It's in China's
interest,"" he said.
 Li said that in China market forces are already playing a
part in adjusting imbalances but a big-bang appreciation of, for
example, 20 percent was unlikely to help as exporters still had
to sell abroad.

 * Says dollar credit worthiness in question	
 * Says may downgrade Portugal, Spain	
 
 BEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The United States is effectively
printing cheap dollars as it implements an ultra-loose policy to
spur its flagging economy, setting the stage for ""a world credit
war"", a Chinese rating agency said on Friday.	
 The Beijing-based Dagong Global Credit Rating, a relative
newcomer in the sovereign debt rating realm, said in its 2011
Sovereign Credit Risk Outlook that quantitative easing by the
U.S. Federal Reserve has ""eroded the legitimacy of the global
monetary system that takes the dollar as the key reserve
currency.""	
 The policy easing was also ""bringing the U.S. dollar's
credit-worthiness to a vulnerable position,"" it said.	
 Dagong, which has been rating Chinese corporate bonds since
1994, created a splash by rating the United States at double-A,
below China's AA-plus, in July 2010. 
 It downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating last
November, following the Fed's decision to pump more dollars into
the U.S. economy. 
 Although Dagong's statement does not fully represent
Beijing's view, it was in line with the government's unhappiness
with the U.S. policy easing, which has been blamed by Chinese
officials for fuelling global inflation risks.	
 As China's $2.85 trillion foreign exchange reserves are
mainly denominated in U.S. dollars, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
had publicly voiced concerns of the assets.	
 President Hu Jintao told a recent G20 summit at Seoul that
China wanted ""an international reserve currency system with
stable value, rule-based issuance and manageable supply"".	
 But Dagong said in the English-language report that the
United States is trying to ""haircut"" its creditors by permitting
a weakening currency.	
 ""The behaviour that the United States ignores international
creditors' legitimate interests indicates a dramatic decline of
the country's willingness to repay the debt"", Dagong said.	
 In defining the ""credit war"", Dagong said ""it aims at
encroach on other countries' interests through continuous
depreciating the actual value of the currency; and it arouses
all the countries in the world to take various credit resources
as a financial weapon to safeguard the national interests"".	
 It added that the capital flows into emerging economics
stemmed from cheap dollar is ""a destructive factor to the
healthy economic development in different countries"".	
 For full version of Dagong's report, see http://www.dagongcredit.com/dagongweb/english/pr/show.php?id=86&table=web_e_zxzx	
 
 PORTUGAL AND SPAIN	
 Dagong added the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone
countries would intensify in 2011 and it may downgrade of
sovereign credit ratings on Portugal and Spain.	
 ""Countries, such as Portugal and Spain, will have to ask for
bailouts in 2011,"" it said.	
 Earlier this month, China reaffirmed a commitment to buying
Spanish bonds while newspapers in December said Beijing was
ready to buy Portuguese debt to help it through Europe's
spreading debt crisis.	
 Echoing the International Monetary Fund and western rating
agencies, Dagong also warned that the governments in the United
States, Japan and Germany will face higher pressure on debt
repayment in case of inflation, economic downturns or if
investors start dumping their bonds. It did not elaborate.	
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Japan's long-term debt
rating on Thursday for the first time since 2002, and hours
later Moody's Investors Service warned the risk of the United
States losing its top AAA rating, although small, was rising.	
 The International Monetary Fund said the G7's two biggest
economies needed to spell out credible deficit-cutting plans
before the markets lose patience and dump their bonds.

 * Indonesia imported bumper rice volume, seeks sugar
 * Sugar import duties remain unchanged
(Updates throughout)	
 By Michael Taylor	
 JAKARTA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia will suspend import
duties on rice, soybeans and wheat as part of government efforts
to fight inflation and the president warned about the global
risks posed by scarce resources, as countries grapple with
escalating food costs. 
 Rising food prices across many parts of the world have been
partly responsible for a number of protests in the last week and
world leaders warned on Thursday they risked stoking more unrest
and even war. 
 Indonesia surprised markets this week by buying
nearly 5 times as much rice as expected, lifting regional
prices, and the measure to remove rice duty until its own
harvest in March could signal it may be looking to stockpile
more of the staple.	
 Fresh demand from Indonesia and Bangladesh for rice is
sending a worrying sign the region's main staple may join a
price surge for other grains, worsening Asia's spiralling food
inflation. Elsewhere, countries like Algeria are rushing to buy
grains, a move seen heading off unrest over food prices as
protests swept north Africa.	
 Food price protests were seen as a major factor in the
ousting of Indonesia's long-term autocratic ruler Suharto in
1998, and investor worries over inflation at a 20-month high in
December led to a sell-off in Indonesian markets this month.	
 ""Globally there is increasing pressure on governments,
especially developing countries where food prices represents a
higher proportion of their CPI basket, to implement some
immediate measures to fight inflation and avoid civil unrest,""
said Chen Xin Yi, analyst at Barclays Capital.	
 Southeast Asia's biggest economy also suspended import
duties for soybeans and wheat for all of 2011, but maintained
duties on sugar despite high prices for the sweetener causing
state firms to fail to buy any in recent tenders.	
 
 Rising food prices, especially for rice and chillis, have
been at the top of Indonesian policy makers' agendas after they
helped drive annual December inflation to near 7 percent,
leading economists to call for rate hikes and President Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono to ask people to start planting food at home.	
 Yudhoyono told the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos
that the next economic war could be over the race for scarce
resources, due to the pressure on food, energy, water and
resources, as the world population could top 9 billion by 2045.	
 ""They are trying everything to add commodity supply into the
country,"" said Wellian Wiranto, economist at HSBC. ""It's a good
thing for inflation, to ease the bottleneck of domestic supply
from overseas. But don't depend on it too much to tame
inflation.""	
 Traders are speculating on what other commodities may see
import duties cut. The archipelago is reliant on imports of
wheat, sugar and soy from Australia, Thailand and the United
States, and occasionally buys rice if government stocks are low.	
 Indonesia hasn't seen food protests so far. Costs may have
eased this month, but the price of rice -- a staple for its 240
million population -- is still high, partly because the main
harvest has not yet started.	
 Earlier this week, Indonesia's state buying agency Bulog
bought a hefty 820,000 tonnes of rice from Thai exporters for
prompt shipment, traders and industry officials said.

 The United Nations' food agency (FAO) this week warned food
producing countries against introducing export curbs to protect
local markets as world food prices rose close to levels that
sparked food riots in 2007/2008, while top executives in Davos
rejected calls for curbs on commodity speculation. 
 Indonesia's scrapping of import duty for rice of 450 rupiah
per kg is unlikely to be extended beyond that date because
imports of the staple are not allowed during the main harvest,
which traditionally runs from March to April.	
 ""Import duties for both soybean and wheat should return to
normal levels of 5 percent each by January 2012,"" Bambang
Brodjonegoro, the head of the fiscal policy office at the
finance ministry, told reporters.	
 
 NO CHEAP NOODLES	
 A soybean industry official said the duty cut would be good
for many producers and consumers, although Indonesian farmers
would be unhappy as it might harm domestic production.	
 He added the decision to cut import duties was not a
surprise and the present situation was not the same as in 2008
when import taxes were suspended because of record prices.	
 He said the import duty cut would ultimately help soybean
imports, but maintained an import forecast of 1.7-1.75 million
tonnes in 2011.	
 Indonesia imports 70 percent of its annual soybean
requirements mostly from the United States, the world's top
exporter, and depends entirely on imported wheat, mostly from
Australia.	
 ""We want the duty to stay zero,"" said a wheat industry
official. ""Wheat is Indonesia's second staple diet after rice.
The farming industry will reject any further duty increases.""	
 Higher wheat prices led Indonesia's PT Indofood CBP Sukses
Makmur , the world's top noodle maker, to say this week
it had lifted the price of its instant noodles by roughly 10
percent a pack, which could further push up domestic inflation.	
 ""The abolishment of import duty will help to some extent to
ease input cost pressure for companies such as Indofood Sukses,
Indofood CBP and Mayora,"" said Wilianto Ie, head of Indonesian
equity research at Nomura in a note on Friday.	
 Some sugar traders were also hoping for a reduction on
import duties, after two white sugar tenders recently failed due
to high prices. The tenders were part of plans to bring in
450,000 tonnes to bridge an anticipated production shortfall.	
 ""This creates difficulties for imported sugar now,
due to sugar prices rising,"" said a sugar trader. ""Those with
import licenses are complaining.""

 * U.S. Q4 GDP numbers eyed
 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) -The euro's rally against the
dollar faltered on Friday and stocks opened weaker ahead of U.S.
fourth-quarter GDP numbers on profit taking, although both look
set to end the week in the black.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent verses the dollar by 0846 GMT,
also giving back some of its gains against the yen following
Thursday's sell-off after Standard & Poors cut Japan's sovereign
credit rating.
 More broadly, however, the single currency remains supported
by the European Central Bank's hawkish tone on interest rates,
Tom Levinson, currency strategist at ING, said, with markets
pricing in more than one 25 basis point hike by year-end.
 ""Barring a nasty return of sovereign-debt related concern
(still likely at some point), the likelihood of the ECB leading
the Fed by some distance in its tightening cycle suggests
EUR/USD can rise further,"" he added.
 Elsewhere, the dollar gained slightly against a basket of
major currencies, up 0.2 percent.
 Stocks also opened lower in Europe and by 0846 GMT, the
benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares was
down 0.4 percent, led by mining stocks, although it remains up
0.2 percent on the week.
 ""We expect equity markets to move into a consolidation phase
in the next couple of months,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, equity
strategist at UniCredit.
 ""People are waiting for the U.S. GDP figures, but it would
only move the market in a big way if the figures significantly
deviate from the consensus.""
 The weakness in European shares continued a broad-based
sell-off in Asia overnight, with Japanese stocks hit by the
previous day's S&P sovereign downgrade and other indices by
inflation concerns.
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average ended down 1.1 percent,
while the MSCI world equity index and Thomson Reuters global
stock index were both trading down 0.4 percent by 0850 GMT.
 Emerging market stocks fared even worse, however, down 0.7
percent.
 The pace of economic recovery in the United States, efforts
to stem the euro zone debt crisis and concerns about building
inflationary pressures continue to guide markets across the
region against the backdrop of the quarterly earnings season.
 Fourth quarter U.S. GDP numbers, due out at 1330 GMT, are
expected to show the world's biggest economy posted the best
quarterly growth since the first quarter of last year, although
unemployment is seen stubbornly high.
 The data should provide direction across markets later in
the session, after U.S. housing and factory data out on Thursday
pointed to a steady economic recovery.
 
 BUNDS UP, ITALY EYED
 Bund futures rose in early trade, tracking U.S. Treasuries,
with traders eyeing the U.S. GDP figures as well as an auction
of Italian debt later in the session.
 Rome plans to auction up to 6.75 billion euros of 2- and
10-year notes later on Friday, and a healthy bid would reiterate
the market's willingness to accept more peripheral euro zone
debt.
 ""Italian supply and U.S. GDP are the pick of the day today,""
a trader said. ""Demand at the Italian auction should be
reasonable. The market may get some concession built in but the
bonds are pretty cheap in that part of the curve.""
 U.S. Treasuries had traded steady overnight in Asia.
 Elsewhere, spot gold slumped to a four-month low as
safe-haven flows waned in the face of the improving U.S.
economic outlook, while benchmark crude oil traded flat.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2011 04:20AM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-Turk Dec trade gap widens 75 pct, more than fcast"," (Adds analysta quotes; background)
 ISTANBUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey's trade deficit widened
75 percent year-on-year in December to $8.68 billion, the
Turkish Statistics Institute said on Friday, exceeding a
forecast $8.15 billion deficit in a Reuters poll.
 Exports rose 18.1 percent to $11.87 billion and imports
surged 36.8 percent to $20.55 billion, the data showed.
 The full-year deficit rose 85 percent to $71.56 billion
compared with a forecast of $70.9 billion.
 Timothy Ash, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in
London, noted export growth running at half that of imports and
said the data reaffirmed concerns about the economy overheating.
 He said the trade data ""will add pressure on policymakers to
work to slow the economy down -- difficult this side of
parliamentary elections"".
 Turkey is due to hold a parliamentary election in June, and
opinion polls show the ruling AK Party of Prime Minister Tayyip
Erdogan well placed to win a third consecutive term in power.
 The AK Party has overseen a period of unprecedented economic
growth in Turkey, which has helped broaden its appeal beyond
socially conservative Turks who make up its core constituency in
the Moslem country.
 The trade deficit makes up the bulk of a current account
deficit that has become one of the main problems for Turkish
policymakers.
 Turkey habitually runs high deficits during periods of rapid
economic growth, as seen last year.
 Analysts expect final data for 2010 to show the current
account deficit rose to around 6.2 percent of GDP, shooting up
from 2.3 percent in 2009, and there are forecasts of a bigger
deficit this year.
 The size of the deficit, and concerns about destabilising
hot money flows, persuaded the central bank to alter strategy
last month, to bring about some depreciation in the lira.
 ""The exchange rate may slow down the growth rate of imports
in coming months,"" Erkin Isik, an economist at Fortis Bank,
commented.
 ""On the other hand, leading indicators for exports show a
significant increase in January, and the trade deficit may be
reduced if this trend continues.""
 The central bank cut interest rates last month and increased
banks' reserve requirments for lira deposits to subdue rapid
credit growth. It followed up with another interest rate cut and
hike in bank's reserve requirements in the past week, in moves
that surprised many market players.

 * Australia ready to do its bit

 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Trade ministers must
set an example of compromise when they meet on Friday to
negotiators in the long-running Doha trade talks if they also
want the backing of voters back home, trade policy-makers said.
 The European Union, the world's biggest exporter, is
hosting a dinner for trade ministers from the other key players
-- Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan and the United States
-- during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
 The seven will take stock of the Doha round after members of
the World Trade Organization agreed to intensify the pace of
negotiations, already in their 10th year, after the G20 urged
them to use 2011 as a window of opportunity to reach a deal.
 ""What we will try to get from ministers is acceleration,""
said WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy.
 Lamy will not attend Friday's dinner, but will take part in
another meeting of some 25 ministers, including the seven, on
Saturday.
 The host of Friday's dinner, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De
Gucht, agreed further moves were needed by all players.
 ""Everyone around the table realises that if you negotiate
it's about give and take. There's nothing bad about a
compromise,"" he told Reuters.
 The Doha round was launched in late 2001 to boost the world
economy and help poor countries prosper through trade.
 While economists differ over the impact of opening markets
in food, industrial goods from cars to chemicals, and services
such as banking and law, several studies show a new trade
agreement could add hundreds of billions of dollars to the world
economy, bolstering business sentiment.
 
 CRITICAL YEAR
 British Trade Minister Stephen Green told Reuters Insider
2011 was a critical year to reach a deal that could
significantly increase global prosperity.
 Other economists say a deal would do little and could hurt
developing countries. The wide-ranging and complex talks have
missed repeated deadlines and some negotiators say 2011 will go
the same way, perhaps dooming the negotiations altogether.
 But in recent months the talks have moved up a gear and some
believe the necessary trade-offs are at last possible.
 ""There seems to be a general acceptance that what is needed
to bring Doha to a successful conclusion is for the major
countries to bring a little bit more to the table,"" Australian
Trade Minister Craig Emerson told Reuters.
 Emerson said Australia, one of the keenest proponents of a
deal, does not believe that it is the one blocking agreement.
 But he said it was willing to consider further concessions
as part of a final push.
 ""If it's a matter of the demonstration of good faith and
everyone bringing more to the table then Australia would be a
willing participant in that,""Emerson said.
 For instance Australia could consider making further cuts in
its already low tariffs, or accepting binding restrictions on
the role of AWB, the former monopoly exporter, he suggested.
 A deal would also bolster the WTO's rules-based system that
had helped the world through the deepest economic and financial
crisis since the 1930s with a minimum of protectionism, he said.
 In the end the deal will require bilateral agreement between
the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies.
 But it is much more complicated than that, with competitive
exporters among the emerging economies, like Thailand and Chile,
wanting to boost South-South trade by opening markets as well.
 The changing nature of world trade may also make it easier
to open markets by cutting import duties, as global supply
chains mean tariffs amount to a tax on your own business.
 ""If you protect imports you will damage your exports,"" Lamy
told reporters.

 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The decline in the
yen following Japan's credit rating downgrade is helping adjust
the currency towards its fundamentals, Asian Development Bank
President Haruhiko Kuroda said.
 The yen hit two-month lows against the euro and two-week
troughs versus the dollar on Thursday after Standard & Poor's
cut Japan's rating for the first time since 2002, saying Tokyo
had no plan to deal with its mounting debt.
 Between 2007 and 2010, the yen has risen more than 50
percent against the dollar . It hit a 15-year high near 80
per dollar in October, despite Japan's yen-selling intervention
the month before.
 ""After the downgrade, bond prices did not move very much.
But the yen did weaken. The yen was overvalued, having risen too
much since 2008 against all currencies in the world,"" Kuroda
told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday.
 ""So the yen adjusted lower -- it's better reflecting
fundamentals,"" added Kuroda, who is former vice finance minister
for international affairs at Japan's Finance Ministry.
 Standard & Poor's cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt
rating by a notch on Thursday to AA-minus, its fourth highest
rating. It said an ageing population, persistent deflation and
the government's loss of its upper house majority compounded the
fiscal challenge.
 Politicians and ratings agencies have warned for years that
Japan must cut its public debt, which is double the size of its
$5 trillion economy -- by far the worst among rich nations.

 INFLATION DILEMMA
 Food inflation is at the top of the agenda for many
policymakers, including Kuroda, with memories still fresh of the
2008 food crisis when soaring prices sparked riots in several
countries, high inflation and in several cases deep trade
deficits.
 Earlier this month, the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organisation said global food prices reached their highest
levels since its records began in 1990 and that grains prices
could climb further as adverse weather patterns give cause for
concern.
 Kuroda said food prices were yet to pose serious risks for
Asia as rice prices remained under control, but robust growth in
emerging economies underpinned real demand for food.
 ""Inflation outside of China is more serious -- Pakistan,
India, or Indonesia. But inflation is the biggest task for
China,"" Kuroda said.
 ""If China let the yuan appreciate more, that will help
control imported inflation. There's more room for that. It's a
plus for China's economy.""
 Many Asian currencies with inflationary problems face a
policy dilemma: higher interest rates will attract capital
inflows, exacerbate asset bubbles. However, unless authorities
act, inflation could get out of control.
 ""It's a typical policy dilemma. Instead of raising interest
rates, bank reserve requirements is one way to tighten
liquidity,"" Kuroda said.
 He added Japan experienced a similar issue in the 1950-60s
when real growth rate was 10 percent and inflation rate was 5
percent, while the exchange rate was fixed at 360 yen to the
dollar. However, back then, the country ran a current account
deficit.

 * Politics make reining in U.S., Japan deficits difficult
 * S&P downgrades Japan, sees no strategy to handle debt
 * Bond markets calm on Friday, Japan vows fiscal discipline
(Adds bullet points)	
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Lesley Wroughton	
 TOKYO/WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Japan and the United
States faced new pressure to confront their swollen budget
deficits as the IMF and rating agencies demanded more evidence
they can bring their public debts under control.	
 The International Monetary Fund said the G7's two biggest
economies needed to spell out credible deficit-cutting plans
before the markets lose patience and dump their bonds.	
 On Friday, Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan vowed to push
ahead with tax reforms aimed at curbing the country's debt, but
an uncooperative opposition and divisions within his own party
on policy make the chances of success slim.	
 ""The important thing is to maintain fiscal discipline and
ensure market confidence in Japan's public finances,"" Kan, who
took over in June as Japan's fifth premier since 2006, told
parliament's upper house.	
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Japan's long-term debt
rating on Thursday for the first time since 2002, and hours
later Moody's Investors Service warned the risk of the United
States losing its top AAA rating, although small, was rising.	
 Bond markets reacted calmly, but the latest warnings about
the colossal liabilities piled up by the two countries raised
fears of rising borrowing costs that could hamper attempts to
restore fiscal discipline and consolidate a fragile recovery.	
 ""In advanced economies where fiscal sustainability has not
been a market concern, credible plans going well beyond 2011
need to be put in place urgently to lock in benevolent market
sentiment,"" the IMF said in its ""Fiscal Monitor"" report.	
 
 The 2007/08 financial crisis prompted a dramatic rise in
developed world debt, as governments spent billions of dollars
propping up sinking economies and bailing out stricken banks.	
 In the United States, outstanding public debt has ballooned
to more than 60 percent of total output since the financial
crisis, and, with a record $1.5 trillion budget deficit expected
this year, is set to grow further.	
 Japan is in an even worse position. Its debt has
been growing for years as it tried to revive the economy from a
huge asset bubble burst in the 1990s and outstanding long-term
government debt now stands at around 180 percent of GDP.	
 Kan has made tax and social security reform, including a
future rise in the 5 percent sales tax, a priority given the
rising costs of Japan's fast-ageing society and a public debt
that is the biggest among advanced nations.	
 Kan needs help from opposition parties to pass broad reforms
and to enact a record $1 trillion budget but analysts said the
ratings downgrade may prove to be a wake up call to lawmakers
and so garner support for his cause.	
 
 POLITICAL CONCERNS	
 In Europe, where Greece and Ireland have been driven by bond
market pressure to take bailouts, many governments have adopted
austerity measures to cut their deficits.	
 But the IMF said new tax cuts in the United States and
increased spending in Japan had set back progress in rich
nations more generally. Ratings agencies fretted that politics
is making reining in the deficit harder for both countries.	
 Moody's worried that a U.S. Congress where the Republican
now control the House of Representatives might fail to consider
and pass some of the deficit-reducing measures proposed by a
panel mandated by Democratic President Barack Obama.	
 S&P, which cut Japan's long-term sovereign rating to AA
minus, voiced similar concerns about Tokyo.	
 ""In our opinion, the Democratic Party of Japan-led
government lacks a coherent strategy to address these negative
aspects of the country's debt dynamics, in part due to the
coalition having lost its majority in the upper house of
parliament last summer,"" the agency said.	
 The debt fears hanging over much of the developed world
underlined the two-speed recovery from the financial crisis,
which has seen emerging economies rebound strongly, especially
in Asia, while the traditional powers struggle.	
 ""People are realizing that emerging markets are not as
dangerous as other places, in light of what has happened,"" Mark
Mobius, chairman of Franklin Templeton's Emerging Markets Group,
told Reuters in Singapore.	
 ""Emerging markets are still cheaper than developed markets
despite the run up, and we see continuing flows into emerging
markets.""	
 
 NO CRISIS YET	
 The reaction of bond markets indicated there is no immediate
crisis on the horizon for the United States or Japan, with the
former protected for now by its status as issuer of the global
reserve currency, while Japan is sheltered by the fact its
sovereign debt stock is overwhelmingly held by domestic
investors with ample savings.	
 Japanese government bonds gained on Friday, recovering from
a dip after the S&P downgrade, although the Nikkei share average
fell 1 percent. 
 ""The immediate impact of the downgrade is negligible. It has
long been accepted that Japan is in an unenviable fiscal
situation,"" said Nobuto Yamazaki, an executive fund manager at
DIAM Asset Management.	
 ""But the downgrade highlighted the fact that the
government's ability to follow through with its policies is
being questioned. This could be a negative factor waiting to
kick in if the government starts running into trouble trying to
push through budget-related issues.""	
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed in Asian trade, with the
benchmark 10-year note up 1/32 in price to yield
3.41 percent, down a basis point from late U.S. trade.	
 ""I don't think there is any risk that U.S. Treasuries will
have difficulty finding a home and at a reasonable price at the
moment. Particularly ... when the Fed is basically giving out
money for free right now,"" said Roland Randall, senior
strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.	
 ""There is a bigger picture of a slow decline in the
perception that people have of whether the U.S. is a safe store
of wealth or not. But that's a big long-term picture.""

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2011 02:19AM ET</span>",SPECIAL REPORT-Renault's spy scandal," Omand believes state security agencies should increase their
support to private firms by providing advice on cyber security,
personnel vetting and other issues. But with the emphasis now on
countering militant attacks, there is a reluctance to do what is
often seen as the private sector's job. ""There is the question
of who pays,"" says Omand. ""The government would expect the
private sector to put its own money into its own protection, and
to make sure they employ the right kind of specialists in IT
security and carry out sensible personnel checks on staff with
access to their information and systems.""
 One of the most reliable ways of improving security, the
veteran corporate security investigator says, is to keep senior
staff happy and well paid -- giving them less of an incentive to
either trade secrets or look at jumping ship to a rival. Keeping
track of data access is also important, particularly in an era

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2011 02:00AM ET</span>","WRAPUP 1-U.S., Japan told time running out to deal with debt "," By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Lesley Wroughton	
 TOKYO/WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Japan and the United
States faced new pressure to confront their swollen budget
deficits as the IMF and rating agencies demanded more evidence
they can bring their public debts under control.	
 The International Monetary Fund said the G7's two biggest
economies needed to spell out credible deficit-cutting plans
before the markets lose patience and dump their bonds.	
 On Friday, Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan vowed to push
ahead with tax reforms aimed at curbing the country's debt, but
an uncooperative opposition and divisions within his own party
on policy make the chances of success slim.	
 ""The important thing is to maintain fiscal discipline and
ensure market confidence in Japan's public finances,"" Kan, who
took over in June as Japan's fifth premier since 2006, told
parliament's upper house.	
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Japan's long-term debt
rating on Thursday for the first time since 2002, and hours
later Moody's Investors Service warned the risk of the United
States losing its top AAA rating, although small, was rising.	
 Bond markets reacted calmly, but the latest warnings about
the colossal liabilities piled up by the two countries raised
fears of rising borrowing costs that could hamper attempts to
restore fiscal discipline and consolidate a fragile recovery.	
 ""In advanced economies where fiscal sustainability has not
been a market concern, credible plans going well beyond 2011
need to be put in place urgently to lock in benevolent market
sentiment,"" the IMF said in its ""Fiscal Monitor"" report.	
 
 The 2007/08 financial crisis prompted a dramatic rise in
developed world debt, as governments spent billions of dollars
propping up sinking economies and bailing out stricken banks.	
 In the United States, outstanding public debt has ballooned
to more than 60 percent of total output since the financial
crisis, and, with a record $1.5 trillion budget deficit expected
this year, is set to grow further.	
 Japan is in an even worse position. Its debt has
been growing for years as it tried to revive the economy from a
huge asset bubble burst in the 1990s and outstanding long-term
government debt now stands at around 180 percent of GDP.	
 Kan has made tax and social security reform, including a
future rise in the 5 percent sales tax, a priority given the
rising costs of Japan's fast-ageing society and a public debt
that is the biggest among advanced nations.	
 
 
 POLITICAL CONCERNS	
 In Europe, where Greece and Ireland have been driven by bond
market pressure to take bailouts, many governments have adopted
austerity measures to cut their deficits.	
 But the IMF said new tax cuts in the United States and
increased spending in Japan had set back progress in rich
nations more generally. Ratings agencies fretted that politics
is making reining in the deficit harder for both countries.	
 Moody's worried that a U.S. Congress where the Republican
now control the House of Representatives might fail to consider
and pass some of the deficit-reducing measures proposed by a
panel mandated by Democratic President Barack Obama.	
 S&P, which cut Japan's long-term sovereign rating to AA
minus, voiced similar concerns about Tokyo.	
 ""In our opinion, the Democratic Party of Japan-led
government lacks a coherent strategy to address these negative
aspects of the country's debt dynamics, in part due to the
coalition having lost its majority in the upper house of
parliament last summer,"" the agency said.	
 The debt fears hanging over much of the developed world
underlined the two-speed recovery from the financial crisis,
which has seen emerging economies rebound strongly, especially
in Asia, while the traditional powers struggle.	
 ""People are realizing that emerging markets are not as
dangerous as other places, in light of what has happened,"" Mark
Mobius, chairman of Franklin Templeton's Emerging Markets Group,
told Reuters in Singapore.	
 ""Emerging markets are still cheaper than developed markets
despite the run up, and we see continuing flows into emerging
markets.""	
 
 NO CRISIS YET	
 The reaction of bond markets indicated there is no immediate
crisis on the horizon for the United States or Japan, with the
former protected for now by its status as issuer of the global
reserve currency, while Japan is sheltered by the fact its
sovereign debt stock is overwhelmingly held by domestic
investors with ample savings.	
 Japanese government bonds gained on Friday, recovering from
a dip after the S&P downgrade, although the Nikkei share average
fell 1 percent. 
 ""The immediate impact of the downgrade is negligible. It has
long been accepted that Japan is in an unenviable fiscal
situation,"" said Nobuto Yamazaki, an executive fund manager at
DIAM Asset Management.	
 ""But the downgrade highlighted the fact that the
government's ability to follow through with its policies is
being questioned. This could be a negative factor waiting to
kick in if the government starts running into trouble trying to
push through budget-related issues.""	
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed in Asian trade, with the
benchmark 10-year note up 1/32 in price to yield
3.41 percent, down a basis point from late U.S. trade.	
 ""I don't think there is any risk that U.S. Treasuries will
have difficulty finding a home and at a reasonable price at the
moment. Particularly ... when the Fed is basically giving out
money for free right now,"" said Roland Randall, senior
strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.	
 ""There is a bigger picture of a slow decline in the
perception that people have of whether the U.S. is a safe store
of wealth or not. But that's a big long-term picture.""

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The yen on Friday recouped some of
the losses it made after Standard & Poor's cut Japan's credit
rating by a notch, while the euro slipped from two-month highs as
players took profits from its recent rally.
 The euro's hefty gains from a four-month low hit less than
three weeks ago suggested it was ripe for profit-taking, but a
mounting number of warnings on inflation from euro zone policy
makers is seen supporting the currency for now.
 The dollar lapsed to 82.70 yen from around 82.90 yen in late
U.S. trade, after initially rallying to as high as 83.22 yen on
Thursday.
 The pair was overwhelmed by selling from Japanese exporters
as well as speculative accounts that were quickly taking profits
from the greenback's jump.
 The dollar's quick retreat only cemented expectations among
traders that its narrow 82.00-83.50 yen trading band will hold
for now.
 The yen also bounced against the euro, which ran into
profit-taking after it hit a two-month peak of 114.02 yen on
Thursday. The euro slipped 0.5 percent on the day to 113.35 yen.
 The single currency fell 0.2 percent against the dollar, with
market participants including an Asian sovereign player said to
be taking profits in the pair following its 7.0 percent rise from
a four-month trough marked earlier this month.
 The euro fell to around $1.3710 from around $1.3730 in late
U.S. trade.
 It went as high as $1.3760 on Thursday after European Central
Bank policy maker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi warned of a rising tide of
imported inflation.
 That was just the latest hawkish comment from ECB policy
makers which have given the market the clear impression that the
bank is likely to tighten well ahead of the Federal Reserve.
 The next chart barriers for the euro are the Nov. 22 high of
$1.3786 and the peak from Nov 10 at $1.3826.
 Breaks here could even unleash a further retracement to
$1.4283 -- a high hit right after the Fed announced a massive
asset purchase programme.
 ""In the race towards a rate hike, the European Central Bank
is going well ahead of the Fed. That points to a gradual decline
in the dollar,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Trust and Banking.
 While market players are aware the problem of debt financing
in some euro zone countries could linger, the euro zone no longer
looks isolated in its suffering given the fiscal troubles in
Japan and the United States.
 Late Thursday, Moody's reminded investors that it might turn
negative on its U.S. rating outlook in the next two years, given
how the country's budget deficit has continued to swell.
 ""Once this knee-jerk reaction (to Japan's downgrade) fades,
the USD could be dragged down by its own fiscal concerns,"" said
analysts at CitiFX in a note to clients.
 Such perceptions may be behind the dollar's weakness, some
market players said, as the the greenback stood near an 11-week
low against a basket of major currencies.
 The index stood at 77.806, having fallen to 77.594 on
Thursday, a level last seen in November.
 The immediate focus will be on U.S. data, including the first
print of Gross domestic product (GDP) due at 1330 GMT, which is
forecast to have grown an annualised 3.5 percent last quarter, up
from 2.6 percent the previous quarter.
 A strong number could help the dollar against the euro.
 It should also benefit risk trades in commodities and
equities and growth-leveraged currencies such as the Australian
and Canadian dollars, though recent falls in commodity prices
have been sapping momentum for these currencies.
 The Aussie dollar slipped 0.3 percent to $0.9890, clinging
near its 90-day moving average at around $0.9894.
 ""It looks like the current adjustment in precious metals is
becoming a major correction. I suspect the Aussie will be under
pressure for some time,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 Gold hit a four-month low on Thursday. Some emerging
countries have seen sharp falls in share prices this month, to
the detriment of growth-linked currencies such as the Aussie.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Friday in
a broad wave of profit-taking, giving up much of this week's
gains, while a ratings cut gave investors an excuse to reduce
their Japanese share holdings.	
 For the week, the MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
is set to eke out meagre gains, thanks to the
U.S. Federal Reserve reiterating its dovish policy stance this
week, indicating flows towards emerging markets will remain
strong for now.	
 Still, Asian shares have underperformed the MSCI world index
, which has risen by 2.5 percent since the
beginning of the year on a combination of factors such as frothy
valuations and a steady drip of positive data out of Europe and
the United States.	
 Data due later on Friday is expected to show the U.S.
economy gathered speed in the fourth quarter, with the biggest
gain in consumer spending in four years offering the clearest
signal yet that a sustainable recovery is under way.

 Last week, Asian stocks fell by more than 6 percent, their
biggest percentage fall in nearly two months, as investors shied
away from markets such as Indonesia and India, on concern
inflation may be getting out of hand.	
 ""We had a billion dollars of outflows in a very short time
and there is bound to be some more selling pressure due to that,
which is what we are seeing after some gains this week,"" said
Markus Rosgen, head of Asia ex-Japan strategy at Citigroup.	
 ""With the Chinese New Year coming up, some people are
concerned about market liquidity too,"" Rosgen said, referring to
a long Lunar New Year holiday next week.	
 Citi strategists recommend staying underweight in Indian and
Southeast Asian shares and overweight in North Asia stocks.	
 India's stock index is poised to register its worst
monthly performance since October 2008 and 10-year Indonesian
bond yields have risen by the most since early 2009.	
 Corporate earnings were robust, with Samsung ,
the world's top memory chipmaker, set to show improved results,
sending its shares to a record. 
 The Nikkei average , one of the best performing
markets this year, was down more than 1 percent, on worries of
higher borrowing costs for financial companies, after Standard &
Poor's cut Japan's credit rating by a notch. 
 
 LIMITED IMPACT	
 Japanese government bonds advanced, taking the ratings cut
in stride, as investors focused more on the country's ample
savings and largely domestically held debt.	
 March 10-year futures opened lower, but quickly
reversed losses to be up 0.20 points at 139.98 as the downgrade
had largely been seen as a matter of time. On Thursday evening,
it fell to as low as 139.48 immediately after the downgrade.	
 Ten-year yields edged lower to 1.215 percent
and credit default swaps widened slightly to
around 83 bps, but well below peaks of near 100 bps hit in 2010.	
 ""JGBs are almost entirely owned by domestic investors, as it
has often been pointed out, and that is limiting the downgrade's
impact,"" said Jun Ishii, chief fixed-income strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.	
 ""This limits any impact of selling by foreign investors, who
may take a dimmer view on JGBs in the wake of the rating cut.""	
 The euro fell, giving in to a bout of profit-taking
after strong gains in the past two weeks took it to a 2-month
high of $1.3760. An Asian sovereign name was spotted selling the
single currency, traders said.	
 Gold held near four-month lows, after falling more
than 2 percent the previous day, on muted safe-haven demand.

 * Cameron says UK must persist with austerity plan
 
 By Adrian Croft
 LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Britain faces a ""particularly
acute"" challenge compared with other European countries in
rebuilding its economy and recovery is likely to be slow,
finance minister George Osborne will say on Friday.
 Osborne's message at the World Economic Forum in Davos will
be echoed by Prime Minister David Cameron who will tell business
leaders in the Swiss ski resort that Britain must persist with
tough spending cuts to curb an ""unsustainable"" budget deficit.
 Cameron and Osborne have faced down calls from the
opposition Labour Party to ease its austerity measures after
data this week showed a shock 0.5 percent contraction of the
economy in the final quarter of 2010.
 Osborne will say that many European governments face the
challenge of fostering sustainable growth. ""As this week's
growth figures demonstrate, the challenge is particularly acute
in the UK,"" he will say, according to excerpts released in
advance by his office.
 ""Over the last decade our economy became perhaps the most
extreme example of any major economy of the dangerous imbalances
that now need to be unwound,"" Osborne will say, citing Britain's
housing boom, indebted households and high budget deficit.
 ""Recoveries from this kind of debt-fuelled boom and bust
tend to be slower and more protracted than those from other
kinds of recession,"" he will say. But giving in to calls for
more government spending would lead to ""even greater disaster
down the line"".
 
 NO SHORT CUTS
 In his speech in Davos, Cameron will warn Britons that the
country faces a long slog back to economic health but must not
postpone dealing with its deficit.
 In a message that appears aimed at debt-ridden euro zone
countries as well as Britain, Cameron will say that his
government's first priority is to ""kill off the spectre of
massive sovereign debts"".
 Average government debt in the European Union was almost 80
percent of economic output, he noted. Some countries were
borrowing 5, 6, or 7 per cent of GDP again this year, while in
Britain's case the figure was more than 10 percent.
 ""This is clearly unsustainable and action cannot be put
off,"" he said in excerpts released by his office.
Cameron's coalition is cutting public spending by around 19
percent over four years to virtually wipe out Britain's deficit.
 Cameron said it would not be easy to turn Britain into an
economy based on savings and entrepreneurial dynamism.
 ""We can't just flick on the switch of government spending or
pump the bubble back up. Making this transformation ... requires
painstaking work and it takes time,"" he said. ""It's going to be
tough -- but we must see it through.""
 ""The scale of the task is immense, so we need to be bold ...
There are no short cuts to a better future,"" he said.
 Britain was making progress, he said. Not long ago Britain
was heading towards a danger zone where markets started to
question its credibility, but its top AAA credit rating had
since been affirmed, he said.
 This was because of planned deficit cuts, he said. ""That's
why we must stick to the course we have set out,"" he said.

 * South Korea has said it needs to import meat
(Recasts, adds industry comment, details)
 By Bob Burgdorfer
 CHICAGO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - South Korea, which has culled
much of its hog herd due to foot-and-mouth disease, has
actively bought U.S. pork this month and ramped up purchases in
the past two weeks, sources familiar with the deals said.
 ""They are certainly in for greater amounts of pork than
they are seasonally,"" a meat industry source said.
 The buying has pushed U.S. hog and pork prices up sharply,
with wholesale pork prices this week the highest in four months
and some U.S. hog futures hitting record peaks.
 South Korea normally buys U.S. pork in January, but this
year the business has been greater than normal to compensate
for the losses in the Asian country's hog herd, sources said.
 Another trade source said buying accelerated this week
after Seoul said it would eliminate import tariffs on up to
60,000 tonnes of imported pork. Much of that will come from the
United States, sources said.
 ""It is absolutely amazing ... the amount of volume that
they have come in looking for, that they have bought, and the
prices they have been willing to pay,"" said another source
close to the business.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture's average pork price on
Thursday was $87.69 per 100 pounds, the highest since September
2010.
 In Chicago hog futures, the actively traded April contract
peaked on Thursday at 92.125 cents, the highest ever for a
second-position contract.
 A South Korean import group earlier this week estimated the
country's pork imports could be up as much as 30 percent this
year.
 The U.S. sources were cautious on predicting how much more
South Korea would buy. The Asian country has vaccinated herds
for the disease, which could prevent further losses.
 Bans on some European pork because of dioxin-tainted feed
could put some extra pork on the world market, giving South
Korea another source of the meat, they said.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen fell sharply
against both the U.S. dollar and the euro on Thursday after
Standard & Poor's cut Japan's long-term credit rating while the
prospect of higher European interest rates weighed on
commodities' prices.
 Wall Street stock indexes held near 29-month highs, boosted
by strong earnings from companies like heavy equipment maker
Caterpillar Inc .
 Standard & Poor's cut Japan's rating one notch to AA-minus,
citing the country's ballooning fiscal deficit, but Japanese
stock markets, which closed before the downgrade news, appeared
poised to open higher on Friday as Nikkei futures traded in
Chicago  rose 55 points to 10,510.
 S&P's move will have a limited impact on Japan's ability to
raise money on financial markets, but it raised a red flag with
investors about government budget deficits in other developed
economies.
 ""It is reasonable to expect that the Japanese downgrade
will raise concerns over the sovereign rating of the U.S.,""
said Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset
Management LLP in London, which oversees $900 million in
assets.
 The yen fell to a two-month low against the euro and a
two-week low against the U.S. dollar. The euro in turn was
boosted against the greenback, after European Central Bank
member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said an expected rise in the prices
of imported goods could not be ignored. [ID:nFLARCE7IJ]
 Commodity prices were mostly lower as the prospect of
rising interest rates in Europe grew. Bini Smaghi, one of six
ECB executive board members, added his voice to a growing
chorus of concern among the central bank's policy makers over
inflation in commodities and emerging-economy made goods.
 ""The ECB has started to show more concern about secondary
price pressures, and the market has acknowledged that,"" said
Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 The euro hit a two-month high of $1.3759, but later pared
gains to trade at $1.3726 , up 0.21 percent. Against the
yen, however, the euro held onto gains, up 0.97 percent at
113.77 .
 Bini Smaghi's comments went to the heart of current
investor concerns, highlighting the potential for inflation to
prompt central banks to raise interest rates at a time when low
rates are seen as key to boosting renewed economic growth.
 Gold prices fell to a four month low,  off $33.98, or
2.53 percent, to $1,311.50 on the growing expectation that
higher rates would would ultimately make bullion a less
attractive investment. [ID:nN27567127]
 Talk of more oil output from OPEC cooled crude prices. U.S.
light sweet crude oil  fell $1.69, or 1.94 percent, to
settle at a two-month low of $85.64 a barrel. [ID:nL3E7CR07M]
 STOCKS EDGE UP
 Global stock markets were mostly higher. Mixed U.S.
economic data on Thursday pointed toward growth momentum with
U.S. housing and factory data higher, but concerns lingered
about employment as weekly claims for jobless benefits were
larger than expected. [ID:nN27280337]
 Economists said they expected Friday's reading of gross
domestic product to show the U.S. economy picking up speed
albeit short of the pace needed to boost job growth.
 At the New York close, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> gained 4.39 points, or 0.04 percent, to 11,989.83. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 2.91 points, or 0.22
percent, to 1,299.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
climbed 15.78 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,755.28.
 Microsoft Corp  shares rose 0.31 percent to $28.87.
The world's largest software maker surprised Wall Street with a
better-than-expected profit, but its shares stayed flat as
investors expressed concern about the weakness of computer
sales amid a faltering U.S. recovery.
 Caterpillar  shares rose 0.91 percent to $96.63
after it reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit.
 Movie rental company Netflix Inc  closed at a
record high $210.87, up 15.21 percent on the day after posting
better-than-expected results Wednesday after the close.
World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up
around 0.18 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top shares closed up 0.16 percent at 1,152.71.
 ""Corporate earnings season has been pretty good. But there
is a lot of complacency -- investors began the year feeling
good about the trends after a good December. The macro backdrop
may give further cause for concern -- there is still some
fragility, and it will challenge the benign view,"" said Bill
Dinning, head of strategy at Aegon Asset Management in
Edinburgh.
 Euro zone government debt yields rose as investors sold
bonds, and the premium investors demand to hold paper from
peripheral euro zone nations rather than German debt also
widened.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 6/32 of a point,
yielding 3.39 percent after demand for an auction of Treasury
debt was met with strong demand. .

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The yen fell to two-month lows
against the euro and two-week troughs versus the U.S. dollar on
Thursday, with further losses likely, after Standard & Poor's
slashed Japan's long-term debt rating.
 The S&P move matched an earlier ratings cut by Fitch and
raised concerns about the risks of downgrades for other
developed economies.
 Although Japan's fiscal troubles are well known, analysts
said the downgrade called into question the yen's status as a
safe-haven currency, boosting the appeal of the dollar and the
likes of the Swiss franc
 S&P, in downgrading Japan to a rating of AA-minus, said the
country's government lacked a coherent plan to tackle its
mounting debt.
 ""It's not good news, but it's not entirely surprising. We
know for instance that the Japanese fiscal situation is quite
weak,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at TD Securities
in Toronto.
 ""And we know that the longer-term trends are quite weak
given the demographics in Japan in terms of age and population
which could put tremendous pressure on the fiscal situation.""
 Overall, Osborne said the S&P move reinforces the potential
for the yen to underperform broadly.
 Several brokerages are also looking at a lower yen against
the dollar. Nomura, for instance, is forecasting the dollar to
rise to 85 yen by end-2011 and 90 by the end-2012.
 ""Continued weak economic fundamentals combined with an
ineffectual political establishment suggest that the yen at
some point in 2011 will start to weaken,"" wrote Ken Dickson,
investment director of currency, at Standard Life Investments
in Edinburgh in a research note. Standard Life has assets under
management of roughly $214 billion.
 ""The trigger could well be the perception that policy
initiatives elsewhere have been introduced to tackle budget
deficits, while little has been done in Japan.""
 In late afternoon trading, the dollar was up 0.7 percent at
82.86 yen after rising to two-week peaks at 83.22 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 The euro rose to 114.02 yen, its strongest since Nov. 22,
and was last at 113.82, up about 1.0 percent.
 So far, analysts say Japan is unlike other nations in that
95 percent of its debt is held by domestic investors, but its
fiscal situation does sharpen the focus on similarly highly
indebted countries such as the United States.
 The U.S. budget deficit, for instance, is expected to surge
to a record $1.5 trillion this year while debt worries in
Europe have already spurred rescues of Greece and Ireland.
 Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset
Management LLP in London, however, downplayed the risks of a
downgrade to the United States. He said the U.S. gross domestic
product is forecast to accelerate while Japan's will likely
moderate. In addition, Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is twice as
high as that of the United States.
 And although deficits in both countries are large, that of
the United States is expected to improve more than Japan's,
Gkionakis said. Fulcrum oversees $900 million in assets.
 Some analysts said the euro may be better placed to gain
against the yen than the dollar given its better interest rate
outlook and worries about U.S. deficit problems.
 The euro rose to $1.3760 on EBS, its strongest since Nov.
22, keeping intact a strong uptrend from a four-month low below
$1.29 hit earlier in the month. It last traded at $1.3732, up
0.3 percent on the day.
 The euro pierced resistance around $1.3740, the 61.8
percent retracement of its two-month decline until early
January. Technical analysts said a daily close above that would
add to the positive tone.
 The next target is the Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 and analysts
say a break of this could prompt more gains towards $1.40.
 The euro was also boosted on Thursday by remarks from
European Central Bank policy maker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi who
warned that an expected rise in imported goods inflation cannot
be ignored, supporting the view that euro zone rates could rise
sooner than later.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2011 03:56PM ET</span>",COLUMN-Dealing with the frenemy: Chrystia Freeland," (Chrystia Freeland is Reuters Global Editor at Large)
 By Chrystia Freeland
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The best line in
President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was his
contention that ""this is our generation's Sputnik moment.""
 It was smart because the essence of the idea is obviously
true: Just as the Sputnik launching in 1957 terrified Americans
with the prospect that they might lose their global scientific
supremacy, the rise of the emerging markets, particularly
China, has made Americans again worry they could be losing
their technological edge.
 The Sputnik analogy was politically canny, too. Ahead of
the president's speech, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the
Republican minority in the Senate, began a pre-emptive attack,
warning Fox News viewers not to be seduced by presidential
pledges of ""investment.""
 ""With all due respect to our Democratic friends,"" he said,
""anytime they want to spend, they call it investment, so I
think you will hear the president talk about investing.""
 Mr. Obama's evocation of NASA and the moon landing was an
emotionally powerful reminder that Americans haven't always
viewed government investment -- or even government spending --
as an unequivocally bad thing. There was a time when big state
projects were the acme of bipartisan patriotism.
 But for all its tactical cleverness and its intuitive
resonance, in one important way the Sputnik analogy was false.
The space race was a contest between two rival but separate
economic blocs. It is no accident that the competition was
waged in the sky -- back on Earth, the capitalist sphere and
the Communist one did not have much commercial contact.
 Today's Sputnik moment is playing out in an utterly
transformed world economy whose defining characteristic is its
interconnectedness. That makes winning a lot harder to define.
The United States wanted the Soviet Union to lose -- not just
in space, but back on Earth. This time around, it isn't quite
that simple. In this age of globalization, America wants to
win, and it wants everyone else to win, too - except when it
doesn't.
 The president's speech reflected that ambivalence. At
times, he framed the country's economic challenge as a Cold
War-style, zero-sum game: ""the competition for jobs is real,""
""we need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest
of the world,"" innovation must ""produce jobs in America and not
overseas.""
 But another part of the address was about enmeshing the
United States more deeply in the global economy and making it
even more dependent on the prosperity of its sometime rivals.
The president talked up trade- - boasting about agreements with
India and China, claiming credit for his hard-won free trade
deal with South Korea, promising to pursue similar pacts with
Panama and Colombia and even giving a boost to the neglected
global trade negotiations.
 Businesspeople (and teenagers) are used to this sort of
complicated relationship with counterparts that are sometimes
rivals and sometimes partners -- they call them frenemies, as
Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the marketing and
communications company, famously described Google.
 Nowadays, countries live in a world of frenemies, too, as
the discussion of reverse innovation, one of the hot topics at
Davos this week, underscored. T.K. Kurian, chief executive of
Wipro IT, the pioneering Indian outsourcing company, said in an
interview that to succeed in the fast-growing emerging markets,
Western companies needed to move some of their research and
development there.
 That, he said, was the only way they could truly
""understand what a frugal environment means.""
 Lest the point be lost on Davos man, Mr. Kurian's boss,
Azim Premji, the chairman of the larger Wipro Limited, told a
cautionary tale of the mistakes Western multinationals make
when they approach emerging markets with the ""mind-set of an
American sitting in Milwaukee or the mind-set of an automobile
design engineer sitting in Detroit.""
 Ford, Mr. Premji said, wanted to create a cheaper car for
the Indian market. To bring down costs, it produced a model
with only two electric windows, rather than four. But those two
were in the front of the car -- next to the chauffeur. Anyone
able to spend $15,000 on an automobile sits in the back seat,
and those owners weren't pleased to be downgraded to manual
windows.
 The good news, Mr. Premji and Mr. Kurian said, was that
Western companies that master emerging market research and
development often find they have come up with an inexpensive
product they can sell to cost-conscious consumers back home.
Except that may not be such good news to the American in
Milwaukee or the engineer in Detroit who joins his blue-collar
brethren in being displaced by workers abroad. Hence -
frenemies.
 The biggest example of how we are all frenemies was Mr.
Obama's push for export-led economic growth. From a national
perspective, it makes a lot of sense: after all, it is a
strategy that is paying off for China and Germany, two of the
world's most robust economies. The catch is that export-led
growth won't work if everyone tries it.
 ""Not everybody can have export-led growth,"" said Lawrence
H. Summers, the president's former chief economic adviser, who
went back to Harvard at the beginning of this year. ""The thing
economists know is that all the trade balances, if you add them
up, have to sum to zero,"" he said, because ""there are no
Martians to whom we can export.""
 And that is why the political leaders here at Davos are
frenemies. Each one wants his country and its national
champions to win in the new global arms race of producing
high-tech, high-value-added exports. But he also wants his
neighbors to be rich enough to buy those goods -- and nowadays
everyone, even consumerist America, has decided that the only
path to prosperity is to likewise pursue a strategy of
export-led growth.
 Balancing these global appetites is the world's Sputnik
moment, and it may make putting a man on the moon -- or even
Mars -- look simple in comparison.

 * No end-date for forex restrictions
 * Analyst says airlines may leave Sudan
 By Opheera McDoom
 KHARTOUM, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Foreign airlines are
struggling to cope with currency restrictions in Sudan that
prevent them repatriating their profits, and analysts say they
could eventually be forced to stop flying there if restrictions
persist.
 Sudan is deep in economic crisis, with inflation soaring
after the central bank was forced to effectively devalue the
Sudanese pound last year and introduced restrictions on moving
foreign currency outside the country to battle forex
shortages.
 The Sudan manager of German airline Lufthansa ,
Hartmut Volz, told Reuters on Thursday the airline industry was
being hit hard, with millions of dollars in revenue stuck
inside Sudan.
 ""All airlines are facing the same problem,"" he said, adding
Lufthansa would decide what to do with its Sudan operation -- a
tiny portion of their global network -- in April.
 ""We are talking to the central bank and to our bank but
there is no chance to get the money out at the time being,""
Volz said.
 Emirates [EMIRA.UL], the Arab world's largest carrier began
to restrict ticket sales inside Sudan because of the forex
shortages. Foreigners must now pay in hard currency or by
credit card and Sudanese by credit card only, which will reduce
traffic because few Sudanese have credit cards.
 ""Many airlines will have to close down (in Sudan) if this
continues,"" said economist and former finance ministry official
Hassan Satti. ""The foreign currency situation is not going to
improve."" About a dozen foreign airlines fly to Sudan.
 Sudanese law prevents airlines selling to nationals in
foreign currency and U.S. sanctions imposed since 1997 stops
credit card transactions, which leaves few options open to
airlines other than to reduce or halt operations.
 Emirates could not immediately comment, but one staffer
told Reuters on Thursday their credit card transactions were
being processed in Dubai to avoid the problem.
 The U.S. embargo means few major foreign companies maintain
a significant presence in Sudan, leaving airlines most affected
by the banks' inability to change their Sudanese pounds into
foreign currency for transfer abroad.
 Under-Secretary of the Investment Ministry Awad al-Karim
Balla said the measures had caused problems but they were
temporary.
 ""We are cooperating with the (central) bank to make some
solutions to this problem, and they promised to do so in the
coming months,"" he said.
 But airlines have not been given any date for an end to the
restrictions to be able to plan around them.

 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The yen fell to two-month lows
against the euro and two-week troughs versus the U.S. dollar on
Thursday, with further losses likely, after Standard & Poor's
slashed Japan's long-term debt rating.
 The S&P move matched an earlier ratings cut by Fitch and
raised concerns about the risks of downgrades for other

 Although Japan's fiscal troubles are well known, analysts
said the downgrade called into question the yen's status as a

 * EU consulting business, talking to China
 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The European Union is
watching the market for rare earth minerals closely and is
determined to secure supplies from China and alternative
sources, its top trade official said on Thursday.
EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht declined to say whether
Brussels would challenge China at the World Trade Organization
over the elements, used in many high-tech goods.
 ""We are following very closely what is happening with rare
earths,"" he told Reuters in an interview, describing the issue
as being of huge geo-strategic importance.
 Rare earths are used in electronics such as smartphones and
hybrid cars as well as a number of defence applications.
 European officials are consulting with affected business
groups and raised the question of rare earth supplies at the
highest level in China during the high-level economic dialogue
held between the world's two biggest exporters last month.
 China, which produces 97 percent of the global supply of the
minerals, cut export quotas by 40 percent last year, leading to
a fall in exports of one tenth in 2010 and alarming its trading
partners. [ID:nTOE70I03O]
 The cut-back, which China argues was taken for environmental
reasons, rang alarm bells in the United States, Japan and the
EU, particularly Germany where sophisticated industries are
highly reliant on imported raw materials.
 De Gucht said the EU was pursuing a solution with two
elements. On the one hand it would try to ensure that China did
not cut-off supplies but respected acceptable export quotas.
 But despite a near monopoly of supply, China has only about
35 percent of rare earth resources, he noted, meaning there was
potential to develop alternative supplies.
 ""We should do something to broaden the market ourselves,"" he
said.
 The EU is also concerned about export duties imposed by
China on the minerals that create dual pricing putting Chinese
manufacturers at an advantage over foreign users of the
elements.
 This issue is the subject of an earlier dispute with China
at the WTO, in which the EU, U.S. and Mexico are challenging
Beijing's export restrictions and duties on other raw materials.
 De Gucht said the EU Commission would issue a strategy
document on raw materials policy next week.
 According to a draft seen by Reuters, the EU will consider
stockpiling raw materials and confront any country that
restricts supplies. [ID:nLDE70O1JH]

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The yen fell sharply against
both the U.S. dollar and the euro on Thursday after Standard &
Poor's cut Japan's long-term credit rating while the increased
prospect of rising European interest rates weighed on
commodities.
 Wall Street stock indexes held near 29-month highs, boosted
by strong earnings from companies like heavy equipment maker
Caterpillar Inc  , news that also supported European
equities.
 Standard & Poor's cut Japan's rating one notch to AA-minus,
citing the country's ballooning deficit, which it said will
further reduce Tokyo's already restricted fiscal flexibility.
 The move will have a limited impact on Japan's ability to
raise money on financial markets, but it raised a red flag with
investors about other leading countries' fiscal imbalances.
 ""It is reasonable to expect that the Japanese downgrade
will raise concerns over the sovereign rating of the U.S.,""
said Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset
Management LLP in London, which oversees $900 million in
assets.
 The euro's gains were sharply curtailed against the U.S.
dollar on profit taking and a rebound in the greenback based on
lower gold prices.
 Commodity prices were mostly lower as the prospect of
rising interest rates in Europe grew after European Central
Bank member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said an expected rise in
imported goods inflation could not be ignored. [ID:nFLARCE7IJ]
 ""The ECB has started to show more concern about secondary
price pressures, and the market has acknowledged that,"" said
Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 The euro hit a two-month high of $1.3759, but later pared
gains to trade at $1.3708 , up 0.08 percent. Against the
yen, however, the euro held onto gains, up 0.89 percent at
113.68 .
 Bini Smaghi's comments went to the heart of current
investor concerns, highlighting the potential for inflation to
prompt central banks to raise interest rates at a time when low
rates are seen as key to boosting renewed economic growth.
 Gold prices fell to a three month low,  off $25.14,
or 1.87 percent, to $1,320.30 on the growing expectation that
higher rates would would ultimately make bullion a less
attractive investment.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell $1.16, or 1.33
percent, to $86.17 per barrel.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The euro hit two-month highs
on Thursday against the U.S. dollar and yen after a credit
rating downgrade for debt-ridden Japan and more hawkish policy
talk in Europe, while global share prices edged higher.
 Wall Street stock indexes held near 29-month highs as
strong results from heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc
 counterbalanced a surprising rise to 454,000 in new
claims for weekly U.S. jobless benefits, the highest level
since late October. For details, see [ID:nN27280337]
 Standard & Poor's surprised markets by downgrading Japan's
long-term sovereign debt one notch from AA to AA minus, citing
the country's ballooning deficit, which it said will further
reduce Tokyo's already restricted fiscal flexibility.
 The move will have a limited impact on Japan's ability to
raise money on financial markets, but it raised a red flag with
investors about other leading countries' fiscal imbalances.
 ""It is not a big a deal as a downgrade of a major European
country or the U.S. as most of Japan's debt is financed
internally, but still, it's a big story,"" said Omer Esiner,
chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in
Washington.
 Among the Group of Seven industrial countries, the United
States, Britain, Italy and France are all carrying large
deficits. Only Germany is looking sound and even it felt an
impact as the cost of insuring its debt against default over
five years hit its highest since March 2009.
 Commodity prices were mostly lower as the prospect of
rising interest rates in Europe grew after European Central

 The euro rose 0.13 percent at $1.3715 , off the

 Bini Smaghi's comments went to the heart of current
investor concerns, highlighting the potential for inflation to
prompt central banks to raise interest rates at a time when low
rates are seen as key to boosting renewed economic growth.
 His comments also further highlighted a policy divergence
with the United States, which on Wednesday left in place
rock-bottom interest rates and gave no indication of backing
away from its loose policies. [ID:nN25283937]

(Recasts; adds details, comment; updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The yen slid against both the
dollar and the euro on Thursday after Standard & Poor's cut
Japan's long-term debt rating, a move that raised questions
about the risks of downgrades for other developed economies.
 Although Japan's fiscal troubles are well known, analysts
said the downgrade called into question the yen's status as a
safe-haven currency, boosting the appeal of the dollar and the
likes of the Swiss franc.
 S&P, in downgrading Japan to a rating of AA-minus, said the
country's government lacked a coherent plan to tackle its
mounting debt.
 So far, analysts say Japan's situation is unlike that of
other nations, though at the very least it has raised questions
and sharpened the risk focus of sovereign wealth funds and
other investors that might view the yen as a safe-haven
currency.
 The dollar was up 0.7 percent at 82.90 yen after rising
more than 1 percent to 83.22 on electronic trading platform
EBS.
 The U.S. budget deficit is expected to blow out to a record
$1.5 trillion this year, and debt worries in Europe have
already spurred financial rescues of Greece and Ireland.
 ""It is reasonable to expect that the Japanese downgrade
will raise concerns over the sovereign rating of the U.S.,""
said Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum Asset
Management LLP in London, which oversees $900 million in
assets.
 Gkionakis, however, downplayed the risks to at least the
United States, pointing out that U.S. gross domestic product is
forecast to accelerate while Japan's will likely moderate. In
addition, Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is twice as high as that of
the United States.
 And though deficits in both countries are large, the United
States's is expected to improve more than Japan's, Gkionakis
said.
 ""It's definitely a yen story,"" said William Reekstin,
managing director with Direct Access Partners in New York.
""Japan had been on the watch list for a long time so it was
expected. It's not the case for the U.S.""
 Still, analysts said the euro may be better placed to gain
against the yen than the dollar, given its better interest rate
outlook and concerns about the debt problems in the United
States.
 Against the yen, the euro rose to 114.02 yen, its strongest
since Nov. 22, up around 1 percent on the day. Other
currencies may also be better placed, particularly the Swiss
franc, which may now be the favored safe-haven currency. It hit
a high around 88.13 yen, its strongest since last April.
 EURO ACTION
 The euro was also boosted on Thursday by remarks by a
European Central Bank policy maker, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, who
warned that an expected rise in imported goods inflation cannot
be ignored, supporting the view that euro zone rates could rise
sooner than later.
 The comments helped the euro extend gains a day after the
Federal Reserve in a policy statement gave no indication that
the U.S. central bank may back away from its loose monetary
policy, contrasting with the hawkish ECB rhetoric.
 ""The ECB has started to show more concern about secondary
price pressures, and the market has acknowledged that,"" said
Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 The euro rose to $1.3760 on EBS, its strongest since Nov.
22, keeping intact a strong uptrend from a four-month low below
$1.29 hit earlier in the month. It later eased to $1.3729, up
0.1 percent on the day.
 The euro pierced resistance around $1.3740, the 61.8
percent retracement of its two-month decline until early
January. Technical analysts said a daily close above that would
add to the positive tone. The next target is the Nov. 22 high
of $1.3786, and some analysts say a break of this could prompt
more gains towards $1.40.

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2011 11:40AM ET</span>","UPDATE 2-Inflation gathers pace in Germany, upward trend seen"," * Preliminary harmonised CPI +2.0 pct y/y vs Dec 1.9 pct
 * Case for ultra-low ECB interest rates seen weakening
 * Germany expected to see second-round inflation effects
 * Underlying consumer prices trending upwards

(Adds new economists comments, graphics link, background)
 By Christiaan Hetzner 
 BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - German consumer prices rose at
their fastest pace since October 2008 this month, data showed on
Thursday, offering early signs that inflation in the euro zone
may now be high enough to be of concern to the European Central
Bank.
 EU-harmonised prices (HICP) grew 2.0 percent year on year in
January compared with 1.9 percent in December.
 The hike missed the 2.2 percent expected by a Reuters poll
and was driven in part by gains in volatile commodities prices,
but analysts said domestic underlying inflationary pressures
were increasing and the case for one or more ECB interest rate
hikes within months had been strengthened.
 ""The case for record low interest rates is getting weaker,""
said Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding, who expects two
rate hikes of 25 basis points each in September and December.
 Apart from further rises in costs of heating oil and fuels
as well as fruits and vegetables, Germany's Federal Statistics
Office said January's increase was also due to a national hike
in electricity bills to subsidize renewable energy producers.
 ""Inflation is back in Germany,"" said UniCredit economist
Alexander Koch, who warned of upward pressure on the core
inflation rate throughout 2011.
 ""The recent strong rise in corporate input prices and also
selling price expectations signal a clear upward trend in
underlying inflation,"" he said.
 Adding to the more hawkish tone, ECB policymaker Lorenzo
Bini Smaghi said earlier on Thursday that rises in imported
goods prices carried an inflation risk for the euro area,
pushing up the single currency and Bund yields.

 POLICY DILEMMA
 Germany's HICP accounts for just over a quarter of the
weighting for the euro zone-wide data that defines price
stability under ECB policy, and inflation there has in the past
undercut the euro zone average.
 January's figure fractionally surpasses the ECB's target
rate for the euro area of close to, but below, 2 percent and
causes a dilemma for policymakers worried about possible
recessions in countries like Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
 Berenberg Bank's Schmieding also pointed to a monthly
European Commission survey published on Thursday that showed a
rise in euro zone consumer inflation expectations for the rest
of this year.
 The forward-looking index jumped 38 percent in the space of
just one month, driven by an even steeper rise in Germany.
 ""The magnitude of the move is significant, even if the index
for the euro area overall is still only marginally above the
long term average,"" he explained.
 German workers at Volkswagen demanded a greater share of
corporate profits, calling for six percent more pay over the
next 12 months alone.
 Economists see these demands as a sign that Germany's
manufacturing industry is starting to overheat, as overflowing
order books, rising commodities prices and a tightening labour
market all point towards a build-up in supply constraints.
 Even when factoring in the depressed inflation rates from
ailing euro zone states, Germany's above-trend growth has led
one economic advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel to predict
inflation could reach 3-4 percent in the next two years for
countries using the single currency.
 Germany's HICP has never risen above the 3.5 percent
registered in July 2008. At that rate, consumers would have to
pay twice as much to buy the exact same goods after just 20
years.
 ""If there is any euro zone country where the risk of
second-round effects from energy and food prices is imminent,
then it is Germany,"" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING,
said on Thursday.
 ""After ten years of wage moderation, strong economic growth,
dropping unemployment and employment growth lead to stronger
wage growth this year, increasing the headache of policymakers
in Frankfurt.""

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2011 11:16AM ET</span>",Q+A-German FDP pressures Merkel in euro rescue debate," By Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Germany's Free Democrats (FDP),
junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, are
resisting efforts to expand the euro zone bailout fund and have
been notably reticent about other EU crisis-fighting measures.
 The FDP, which has plunged in opinion polls since returning
to power after an 11-year absence, sees itself as a defender of
taxpayers and free markets, and hopes a eurosceptic stance will
help revive its fortunes in seven state elections in 2011.
 Despites its ratings, the FDP holds nearly one third of the
seats the coalition needs for a parliamentary majority and its
opposition to Berlin bearing the risks for other countries makes
it harder for Merkel to sell rescue measures to the public.
 Following are some questions and answers about the FDP.
 
 WHAT IS THE FDP'S POSITION ON THE EFSF?
 FDP deputies in parliament oppose adding further funding to
the 440-billion euro European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF) that was set up after Greece was bailed out last year and
rule out new steps that would affect German taxpayers.
 They are sceptical about European Union rescue efforts,
fearing that adding to the fund would do nothing to remove
structural problems in the euro zone. The FDP has also been
vehement in its opposition to the suggestion of joint euro zone
bond issues, in tune with the official government position.
 
 WHY IS IT WARY OF EURO RESCUE MOVES?
 The FDP won 14.6 percent of the vote in the 2009 election
but has crashed to between 3 and 4 percent support in polls due
to voter disenchantment over its failure to push through its
campaign promise of tax cuts.
 The dizzying slide has frayed nerves ahead of seven state
elections in 2011 and the party believes an anti-Europe stance,
coupled with its ardent defence of German taxpayer interests,
will prove popular and help prevent a drubbing in the polls.
 Many members of parliament in Merkel's Christian Democrats
(CDU) are also wary about euro zone rescue efforts even though
the conservatives are not as united on the issue as the FDP.
 A poll for ARD television last month showed 60 percent of
Germans believe the euro has brought more problems than benefits
and 56 percent said countries unable to get their finances in
order should quit the currency bloc.
 Analysts say the FDP's resistance to crisis-fighting moves
also helps distract from internal woes, in particular a debate
about whether Guido Westerwelle -- Merkel's deputy chancellor
and foreign minister -- should be replaced as FDP leader.

 WHAT DO FDP LEADERS SAY?
 FDP chairman Westerwelle said after meeting EU Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn this week that he was still not
persuaded that the bailout fund should be expanded. ""To discuss
expanding the rescue fund today, when only 10 percent has been
used, is not convincing,"" he said.
 FDP parliamentary floor leader Birgit Homburger has taken a
hardline stance: ""There is no need to change anything,"" she
said. ""No one will be helped if we simply cover over the
problems by raising the size of the rescue fund.""
 FDP general secretary Christian Lindner dismisses criticism
that the FDP has become anti-European to win over voters. ""We
won't allow anyone to doubt the European responsibilities and
foundations of our policies. We're quite clearly pro-European.""
 
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR MERKEL?
 If Merkel ignores the FDP, she may jeopardize the coalition,
whose stability has already been tested by discontent among Free
Democrats over Westerwelle's failure to deliver on promises. The
FDP has had little to show for its efforts and analysts say
Merkel must pacify them to keep the coalition afloat.
 At the same time, although her conservatives are recovering
from a poll slump, they are wary of being outflanked on the
right on Europe, because surveys show the ruling parties could
suffer heavy losses in this year's seven state elections.
 
 WHAT IS BEING DONE TO PERSUADE THE FDP?
 Olli Rehn spent several hours visiting FDP deputies in
Berlin this week. He told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
newspaper on Thursday that he faced a tough grilling.
 ""I got a lot of hard and substantial questions and tried to
answer them accordingly,"" he said. ""In any event, we managed to
bring our positions closer together.""
 
 HAS IT ALWAYS APPEARED SO EURO-SCEPTICAL?
 No. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a long-serving foreign minister,
had a towering reputation as a European leader, in tandem with
then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Genscher, still a godfather-like
figure in the FDP, is reportedly aghast at its current stance.
 Der Spiegel news magazine quoted Genscher associates saying
he found the FDP's populist moves devastating and was trying to
persuade them to change course behind the scenes. FDP leaders
fear Genscher may publicly criticise their position.
 The FDP once saw itself as a advocate of liberal values in a
broader sense. But in recent years its focus has been limited to
economic issues. The party calls itself ""liberal"" but is
derisively known as the ""party of dentists and doctors"".

 (Adds Ghana comment paragraph 4)
 By Loucoumane Coulibaly and Ange Aboa
 ABIDJAN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A small but increasing flow of
cocoa beans is being smuggled out of Ivory Coast as exporters
halt shipments from the top grower due to a political crisis,
sending global prices to one-year highs.
 Exporters are mainly complying with presidential claimant
Alassane Ouattara's call for a month-long ban on exports in a
bid to starve revenues from incumbent Laurent Gbagbo, who has
refused to quit despite U.N.-certified results of a Nov. 28 poll
showing Ouattara won.
 Around 35,000-40,000 tonnes -- less than the amount that
normally comes into the West African country's main ports each
week -- has been smuggled east across the border to Ghana since
the start of the season on Oct. 1, Ivorian industry sources
estimated. A Ghanaian industry source estimated the volume was
lower, at no greater than 30,000 tonnes.
 But that figure is expected to rise in coming weeks as
producers race to find alternative buyers for a harvest which
will start to deteriorate if held in the bush for too long.
 ""Last Tuesday I counted 36 trucks loaded with cocoa go
through my village en route to Ghana between four and nine
o'clock,"" said Attoungbre Kouame, a farmer in the border region
of Abengourou, by telephone.
 ""The farmers reckon the contraband traffic will grow because
exporters are not buying the cocoa anymore,"" he said.
 Farmer Etienne Yao confirmed similar activity in the south
eastern region of Aboisso.
 ""The contraband traffic is continuing and it will increase,""
said Yao. ""If the exporters don't buy, prices will drop and
instead of the farmers being stuck with it, they will prefer to
sell to Ghana.""
 ICE second-month cocoa gained $8 or 0.24 percent to $3,346
by 1605 GMT on Thursday.
 Industry sources said earlier this week that many exporters
continued to buy cocoa for now but did not actually register it
for export -- the point at which the ban applies.
 However, officials at export firms told Reuters Ivory
Coast's cocoa warehouses were nearing full capacity, with around
50,000 tonnes of spare space -- the equivalent to around a
week's usual port arrivals -- at Abidjan and San Pedro ports.
 Ivorian industry sources said authorities were seeking to
clamp down on smuggling into Ghana, and that some of it was
being discreetly taken across the border by motorbike or even
bicycle, which helped explain the low volumes until now.
 
 GHANA ON ALERT
 The head of Ghana's industry regulator Cocobod told Reuters
on Thursday it was stepping up measures to block Ivorian beans
-- viewed as being of lower quality -- from getting into the
Ghanaian supply chain.
 ""Even though we haven't yet recorded any case of smuggled
cocoa from Ivory Coast, we believe it is necessary to strengthen
existing measures on the ground to safeguard the quality of our
beans against possible inflows,"" Cocobod Chief Executive Tony
Fofie said in an interview.
 A Cocobod source said no more than 30,000 tonnes of Ivorian
cocoa had entered the country so far this season, an amount too
small to affect the quality of Ghana's overall crop which is
forecast to hit a record 800,000 tonnes.
 Patrick Achi, spokesman for the Ivorian government nominated
by Ouattara, said up to 80 percent of exporters have complied
with the export ban. Even though Gbagbo still is deprived of
revenue from smuggled cocoa, Achi said Ouattara could not
condone the illegal activity.
 ""The one-month timeframe is not so long that operators will
take the risk to export large amounts through smuggling routes.""
Achi warned, however, the impact to cocoa and other industries
would be serious if the deadlock is longer.
 A separate cocoa route through the north, which has been
operating since the 2002-2003 civil war, takes supplies from the
rebel-held towns of Man and Vavoua out through Burkina Faso in
and then down through Togo into the port of Lome.
 Tax is deducted as cocoa heads north -- thus not going to
the Gbagbo government in the south -- and the beans are dried
and processed in the southern Burkinabe town of Bobo Dioulasso
before being trucked through to Lome.
 ""It's pretty lively at Vavoua at the moment. We have got a
lot of cocoa this year, which means we have already sent around
50,000 tonnes to Lome since the start of the season,"" said local
merchant Alexis Yameogo.
 Two industry sources, who asked not to be named, said that
if the ban lasted and exports through Ivorian ports remained
blocked, use of this route is likely to increase.

 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The yen slid against both the
dollar and the euro on Thursday after S&P cut Japan's long-term
debt rating to AA minus, saying the country's government lacked
a coherent plan to tackle its mounting debt. [ID:nL3E7CR0RQ]
 Although Japan's fiscal troubles are well known, analysts
said the ratings cut called into question the yen's status as a
safe-haven currency, boosting the appeal of the dollar and the
likes of the Swiss franc.
 The euro hit a two-month high against the dollar and yen on
Thursday after a European Central Bank policymaker expressed
concern about inflationary pressures, further highlighting a
policy divergence with the United States.
 ""It is not a big a deal as a downgrade of a major European
country or the U.S. as most of Japan's debt is financed
internally but still it's a big story,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 The dollar was up 0.9 percent at 82.88 yen after rising
more than 1 percent to 83.22 on electronic trading platform
EBS.
 Implied option volatilities for dollar/yen briefly jumped
on the S&P downgrade but then was little changed, with the
one-month  steady around 9.60.
 However, traders said risk-reversals were showing less of a
bias for the yen. The three-month risk reversal was last
trading at 0.55 with a bias for dollar puts and yen calls,
according to Reuters data.

 ECB policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi warned on Thursday that

hawkish ECB rhetoric.
 ""The ECB has started to show more concern about secondary

Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 The euro  rose to $1.3760 on EBS, its strongest
since Nov. 22, as it kept intact a strong uptrend from a
four-month low below $1.29 hit earlier in the month. It later
eased to $1.3749, up 0.3 percent on the day.
 The euro pierced resistance around $1.3740, the 61.8
percent retracement of its two-month decline until early
January. Technical analysts said a daily close above that would
add to the positive tone. The next target is the Nov. 22 high
of $1.3786 and some analysts say a break of this could prompt
more gains towards $1.40.
 Against the yen, the euro  rose to 114 yen,
its strongest since Nov. 22, up around one percent on the day.
 But with a contrarian view, UBS reiterated their
three-month euro/dollar target of $1.25.
 ""The rising expectations for a 'comprehensive solution' and

 * When: Monday, Jan. 31
 * 9 out of 11 analysts expect 25 bps hike in deposit rates
 * 4 out of 11 analysts also see 25 bps refi rate hike
 MOSCOW, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank will likely
raise deposit rates by 25 basis points on Monday, the second
such step in as many months as it seeks to tame inflation.
 Faced with soaring food prices, Russia switched its focus to
fretting about inflation from supporting economic growth with
ultra low rates in the autumn, and in December the central bank
delivered the first increase in deposit rates.
 The refinancing rate -- officially seen as the benchmark
rate, but in practice less influential on domestic liquidity and
money markets -- was left on hold at 7.75 percent at the time
and analysts are split on whether it will be increased now.
 Here are the possible outcomes of the Jan. 31 meeting.
 
 DEPOSIT RATES RAISED 25 BPS
 PROBABILITY: Expected by 9 out of 11 analysts.
 Consumer prices have already risen 1.8 percent in the first
24 days of January, threatening the central bank's target of a
full-year price increase of just 6-7 percent.
 Central bank's first deputy chairman Alexei Ulyukayev
expects price pressures would continue through the first half of
the year [ID:nLDE70Q0AM], while his boss Sergei Ignatyev has
said inflation gives grounds for a rate rise.
 ""Almost no one doubts that the central bank will go for
another 25 basis point increase in deposit rates,"" analysts at
Trust Bank said in a note.
 Such an increase would take the overnight deposit rate to
3.00 percent from the current 2.75 percent.
""Money market rates remain around deposit rate levels, so it
is clear that further moves in deposit rates will determine the
moves on the money market,"" said Anton Nikitin at Renaissance
Capital.
 The currently ample level of liquidity and the popularity of
the central bank's deposit operations back this theory.
 MARKET REACTION: Markets have already widely priced in an
increase in deposit rates, which has helped support the rouble
in recent weeks . Bond market yields have surged, leading
to weak demand at an auction of Finance Ministry's bonds this
week. [ID:nLDE70P1RZ]
 REFINIANCING RATE ALSO RAISED BY 25 BPS
 PROBABILITY: Possible. Expected by 4 of the 11 analysts.
 In addition to the deposit rates, Russia could also raise
lending rates, including the benchmark refinancing rate. 
 Arguing against such a move is the central bank's stance
that it would like to reduce the corridor between its various
interest rates as it strives to increase the impact of rate
changes while shifting to inflation targeting.
 On the other hand, by hiking the refinancing rate the
central bank could further strengthen its signal to the markets
-- that it is concerned about inflation and ready to act.
 MARKET REACTION: Likely to exacerbate the current trends of
firm rouble and rising bond yields.
 
 ALL RATES ON HOLD
 PROBABILITY: Small chance. Expected by 2 of the 11 analysts.
 January inflation distorted by the seasonal factors, such as
annual hikes in tariffs for transport, water and heating. As
such, some analysts say the central bank may wish to wait to see
to what happens to inflation later in the year.
The economy is still looking relatively fragile, and there
is concern that higher rates could stifle a nascent recovery in
bank lending.

* Agriculture Minister promises free trade in Q4
* Traders says need proper rules
(adds quotas, traders' comments)
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Ukraine's Agriculture Ministry will
urge the government to allow unlimited exports of grain in the
forthcoming 2011-2012 marketing season, Minister Mykola
Prysyazhnyuk told Reuters on Thursday.
 ""We will insist on there being no export restrictions next
season,"" he said.
 Ukraine, the world's top barley exporter and a major wheat
supplier, introduced export quotas after a drought last summer
to prevent a rise in domestic bread prices after neighbouring
Russia banned grain exports for the whole 2010/11 season.
 In October, the government introduced a 2.7 million tonnes
grain export quota while in December it extended the quotas
until March 31 and increased the total volume to 4.2 million
tonnes.
 Ukraine, which consumes 26 million tonnes of grain per
season, harvested 39.2 million in 2010 and could sell abroad at
least 13 million this season, according to government estimates.
A farm ministry official told Reuters Ukraine had exported
6.9 million tonnes of grain as of January 25, leaving room for
exports of additional 6 million tonnes by the end of the season.
 Prysyazhnyuk said his ministry would propose lifting export
curbs for the last quarter of the current season and to boost
the volume of quotas for January-March.
 ""We are considering lifting quotas for maize exports or
about increasing them to the maximum. It means exports of
additional 2.0 million tonnes of maize and 1.0 million of
wheat,"" Prysyazhnyuk said.
 ""From April, I hope, we could get rid of quotas"", he said.
 But traders said they needed proper rules on the Ukrainian
grain market and guarantees for their current and future
investments.
 Ukraine's largest domestic grain exporter Nibulon said it
had failed to win export quotas and had to suspend its
investment projects.

 * Unemployment falls to record low of 5.3 pct in December
 * Tight labor market, credit growth pressuring inflation
 By Luciana Lopez
 SAO PAULO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank laid
down a tough line against inflation on Thursday, calling for a
range of policy tools to curb prices as record-low unemployment
underscored the pressure on Latin America's biggest economy.
 In minutes from its most recent monetary policy meeting,
the central bank said a tight labor market and robust domestic
demand would continue to pressure consumer prices, requiring
broad government action to bring inflation back on target.
 One week after the bank raised interest rates for the first
time in six months, it stressed that monetary policy alone is
not enough to rein in inflation and singled out a need for
fiscal restraint -- a reference to a pledge by new President
Dilma Rousseff to cut public spending. [ID:nN27240799]
 ""The central point is that (the minutes) are unequivocally
hawkish,"" said Neil Shearing, senior emerging markets economist
at Capital Economics Ltd in London.
 ""If there were any lingering doubts as to whether or not
(the central bank) would shift priorities under the new
governor, Alexandre Tombini, I think they've been well and
truly banished now.""

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Tombini, who took the helm of the central bank at the start
of the month, had been under pressure to prove his
inflation-fighting credentials to markets as prices advanced.
 Inflation surged to a six-year high in 2010 on the back of
an economic boom, finishing the year at 5.91 percent -- well
above of the center of the bank's target of 4.5 percent, plus
or minus 2.5 percentage points.
 Last week, the central bank raised its benchmark Selic rate
to 11.25 percent from 10.75 percent, noting in a statement that
the move started ""a process of adjustment of the benchmark
interest rate.""
 Brazil's economy likely grew in 2010 at its fastest pace in
more than two decades, fueled by a credit boom, record-low
unemployment and higher wages. The jobless rate 
closed out the year at an all-time low, falling to 5.3 percent,
government data showed on Thursday. [ID:nN27135595]
 That's only about one-quarter Spain's jobless rate, which
stood at 19.8 percent in the third quarter, and far lower than
the 9.4 percent unemployment in the United States in December.
 ECONOMIC TRADE-OFF
 Once a chronic economic basket case, signs of Brazil's
expansion are everywhere: help wanted signs dot neighborhoods
in the financial capital of Sao Paulo, and shopping malls and
showrooms are packed with new members of the middle class,
buying the kind of status symbols once restricted to the
richest slice of the population.
 But Brazil's brisk growth has come at a cost: speeding
inflation and a rapidly strengthening currency, which is
hurting exporters by making their goods more expensive in the
global marketplace.
 While higher interest rates will help contain inflation,
they could also fuel more firming of the Brazilian real 
as foreign investors flee near-zero interest rates in more
developed economies for higher yields in emerging markets like
Brazil and Turkey.
 Those worries have prompted cries of a ""global currency
war"" in several developing economies, straining relations and
trade ties with the world's two biggest economies, the United
States and China.
 For its part, Brazil's central bank emphasized the need for
a range of tools to keep the economy on track, including the
fiscal cuts promised by the Rousseff administration. Details of
the budget freeze are expected to be unveiled in February.
 The bank's inflation outlook ""takes into account the
realization of fiscal targets that the bank is working with,""
the minutes noted. ""It's important to highlight that primary
surpluses compatible with those assumed by inflation forecasts,
besides cooling the gap between growth and supply, will
solidify the reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio.""
 Besides interest rates, the bank has looked to other
possibilities to cool consumer prices pressures. It has raised
the percentage it makes banks hold from their deposits and
announced it could start holding auctions to buy currency
forwards, efforts to cool credit and brake the real without
using interest rates.
 ""It's a trade-off: You either accept a higher value
currency or accept implicitly some inflation,"" Shearing added.

 * Support of military key 
 * Social media revolution a game changer
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Authoritarian leaders threatened
by protest, international pressure or an inconvenient election
result must master a complex strategic game to retain power.
 Methods include control of food and fuel, repression and
censorship. Isolation and fickle allies can prove a leader's
undoing.
 The ousting of Tunisian President Ben Ali shows how fast a
grip on power can loosen. It is a lesson others -- Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak, Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo and ageing rulers in
Central Asia and the Gulf -- won't ignore.
 ""Tunisia was very striking in the way a power elite was
swept away particularly fast and unexpectedly,"" said Jonathan
Wood, global issues analyst at consultancy Control Risks. ""There
will be plenty of others who are watching very closely.""
 Throughout history, absolute rulers have sought to retain
power by placating or cowing the populace while maintaining the
loyalty of troops and managing internal and external alliances.
 Tunisia's Ali now looks set to join the list of one-time
leaders living out their lives in exile.
 ""Out of power, they are very sad,"" says Riccardo Orizio, an
Italian journalist who has tracked down Uganda's Idi Amin,
Central African Republic's Jean-Bedel Bokassa and Poland's
Communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski.
 ""All these dictators were fundamentally political animals.
They were obsessed with power, getting in and exercising it."" 
 Having interviewed the leaders in crumbling mansions or
modest suburban homes a far cry from their one-time splendour,
he believes many of them lost touch with the once finely honed
political instincts that won them office.
 ""To be at the centre of a society almost built around you as
some of them were must be an incredible sensation,"" he said.
""The temptation has to be there to listen only to the voices
that agree with you... Put any Western liberal democratic
politician in the same position and see how they react.""
 
 INFORMATION AGE
 Authoritarian states are facing an information age. Control
of the media is harder and protest can spread much faster.
 Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables, disseminated by WikiLeaks and
then reposted and e-mailed, paint a picture of corruption and
rights abuses. While websites such as Twitter can be blocked,
experts say many users still find ways to access them.
 ""If you're trying to shut down mainstream media, it's quite
easy -- you go after the printing presses, the television
station,"" said London-based social media strategist Mark Hanson.
""With social media that is much more difficult.""
 Experts say leaders will choose different routes to tackle
this trend, from crackdowns to reform -- and possibly more
online engagement by national leaders themselves. But they also
have more traditional political levers to pull.
 One of the most obvious -- although not the easiest -- is to
deliver prosperity. It is no coincidence that leaders in Russia
and Saudi Arabia tend to be seen as more secure during times
when oil prices are rising.
 In North Africa, where grain has been at the centre of
political power since the pharaohs, governments have increased
imports and kept up subsidies since Tunisia's revolt.
 
 GREAT GAME
 Power dynamics vary sharply. In Russia and Central Asia,
political power comes more from spy agencies than armies. In
some states, fuel and food are politically sensitive. In others,
tribal and ethnic divisions may hold the key to power.
 For Gbagbo in Ivory Coast, staying in office requires
keeping cocoa revenue flowing to pay troops.
 The growing diplomatic and economic clout of China and other
emerging powers also gives authoritarian leaders -- such as
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe -- new potential backers. Playing
powerful states off against one another has long been a tactic.
 Orizio says such support proved a mixed blessing for his
exiled interviewees. With hindsight, he says they believe they
were never masters of their own destiny.
 ""Almost all of them said that they felt used,"" he said.
""They were a small wheel in the greater turn of history. The
other powers -- the U.S., the Soviet Union -- used them when it
was convenient and then things changed and they were abandoned.""

 * Inflation expectations 12 months ahead soar
 * Business climate indicator rising close to highs
(Recasts with economists' comments) 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment
was broadly flat in January against the previous month, pointing
to a firm start to 2011, but also to growth differences within
the currency area which might pose a problem for ECB policy.
 The European Commission's monthly survey showed economic
sentiment among the 17 countries using the euro eased to 106.5
this month from 106.6 in December.
 This was below economists' expectations of a rise to 107.0
in a Reuters poll, but still seen as a decent pace, especially
given that the December number was revised upwards from 106.2.
 ""The figures suggest that the euro area on average is still
on a modest recovery path. But obviously the data also show that
the divergence between the member countries remains large,"" said
Juergen Michels, economist at Citigroup.
 While sentiment in industry rose to 6.0 points from a
revised 4.9 in December, sentiment in the services sector fell
to 9.2 from 9.6 and among consumers to -11.2 from -11.0. 
 The retail sector showed the biggest drop in optimism to 0.1
from 4.5 while sentiment in the construction sector improved
marginally to -26.0 from -26.5.
 ""The bad news is that the growth differences between the
euro area countries are still very large. The key question is:
For how long will the European Central Bank take the situation
in the crisis countries into account and leave its key rates at
the current, very low level?"" said Christoph Weil, economist at
Commerzbank.
 Sentiment in Greece rose to 75.6 from 73.3, but remained
well below the long-term average of 100. No data was available
for Ireland, but in Portugal sentiment eased to 91.2 from 91.9
and in Spain it inched up to 91.3 from 91.1.
 German sentiment, on the other hand, despite an easing to
115.6 from 117.3 remained high above the long-term average.
 ""The figures show that the German economy is quickly
overcoming the crisis, while the peripherals are continuing to
lag behind,"" Weil said.
 ""Low interest rates will fuel growth further in the
well-performing countries, above all in Germany. In contrast,
the monetary stimulus is largely offset by the fallout from the
burst real-estate bubbles and reinforced consolidation efforts
in the crisis countries,"" he said.
 The ECB's task in deciding when to move its benchmark
interest rate off a record low of 1.0 percent may not be made
any easier by the sharp rise in inflation expectations among
euro zone households in January and selling price expectations
among manufacturers.
 The European Central Bank expects inflation, which was 2.2
percent year-on-year in December, to rise even further in the
coming months, but then to ease in the second half of the year.
 The ECB wants to keep inflation below but close to 2 percent
and economists said the diverging growth rates combined with a
rise in inflation expectations could make monetary policy-making
more difficult.
 ""If the recovery continues at a stronger pace than the ECB
expected it is going to give them a headache,"" said Carsten
Brzeski, economist at ING bank. 
 The Commission's business climate indicator for the euro
zone, which points to the phase of the business cycle, rose to
1.58 from 1.38 in December. 
 ""The level of the indicator is approaching the historical
peak reached in spring 2007, suggesting that the recovery in
industry will continue in the coming months,"" the Commission
said in a statement.
 But economists said the Commission inflation expectations
survey was not crucial to ECB decision making as the bank tended
to rely more on polls looking further into the future from
professional forecasters.
 ABN AMRO's chief euro zone economist Nick Kounis said the
Commission survey on inflation tended to lag real inflation
developments in recent months, and might therefore be reflecting
more past inflation rises than future trends.

 * Short-term impact cuts GDP 0.3-0.6 pct

(Adds details)
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The devastating
floods in Australia will have a positive long-term impact by
making farmland more productive, Trade Minister Craig Emerson
said on Thursday.
 ""We've been through a severe drought for a very long time so
we might be in for a pretty good harvest of our winter crop down
the track,"" Emerson told Reuters Insider.
 According to preliminary estimates, the impact of the floods
on coal exports, farming and the cost of reconstruction will
reduce gross domestic product by 0.3-0.6 percent, he said.
 But rising coal prices and the boost to farm productivity
will fuel strong economic performance in the coming years,
allowing the government can withdraw fiscal stimulus and stick
with its plan to return to budget surplus in 2012-2013, he said.
 Emerson said Australia, a major exporter of farm produce,
believed the way to deal with food price inflation that was
exacting a terrible social toll on poor countries was by opening
up agricultural markets further to remove supply constraints.
 Chinese demand for Australian commodities was one of three
major reasons that Australia had been able to avoid the worst of
the economic downturn, Emerson said.
 But he said the trade-fuelled appreciation of the Australian
dollar was in turn affecting export competitiveness, and
Australia needed to boost productivity.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
against the dollar on Thursday after a euro zone policymaker
expressed concern about inflationary pressures, further
highlighting a policy divergence with the United States.
 The single currency also hit a two-month high against the
yen, which fell broadly after S&P cut Japan's long-term debt
rating to AA minus, saying the country's government lacked a
coherent plan to tackle its mounting debt.
 European Central Bank policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi warned
on Thursday that an expected rise in imported goods inflation
cannot be ignored, supporting the view that euro zone rates
could rise sooner than previously thought.
 The comments helped the euro extend earlier gains after a
Federal Reserve statement the previous day gave no indication
that it may back away from its loose monetary policy,
contrasting with recent hawkish ECB rhetoric.
 ""The ECB has started to show more concern about secondary
price pressures, and the market has acknowledged that,"" said
Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3756, Reuters data showed, its
strongest since Nov. 22, as it kept intact a strong uptrend from
a four-month low below $1.29 hit earlier in the month.
 The euro broke resistance around $1.3740, the 61.8 percent
retracement of its two-month decline until early January. The
next target is the Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 and some analysts say
a break of this could prompt more gains towards $1.40.
 Against the yen, the euro rose to 113.88 yen, its strongest
since Nov. 22.
 Falls versus the euro and more negative dollar sentiment
after the Fed statement helped push the dollar index down 0.4
percent to an 11-week low of 77.594.
 
 YEN FALLS
 Although Japan's fiscal troubles are well-known, analysts
said the ratings cut called into question the yen's status as a
safe-haven currency, boosting the appeal of the dollar and the
likes of the Swiss franc.
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 82.70 yen. It earlier rose
more than 1 percent to 83.20 yen, surpassing its 55-day moving
average around 83.08 yen. 
 Traders said offers between 83.10 and 83.30 yen may cap
gains, with reported stops placed above 83.30 yen and an options
expiry at 83.00 yen.
 However, analysts said the euro may be better-placed to gain
against the yen than the dollar, given its better rate outlook
and concerns about the hefty debt problems in the U.S. and the
U.S. government's loose fiscal policy.
 Other currencies may also be better-placed, particularly the
Swiss franc, which may now be the favoured safe-haven currency.
It hit a high around 88.09 yen, its strongest since April 2010.
 ""Given that we believe the immediate dollar-positive impact
of the news is likely to fade, we favor long positions in
cross-yen as a means of positioning for additional yen
depreciation,"" analysts at Citi said in a note.

German states in January, data showed on Thursday, in an early
sign that consumer prices in the broader euro zone may be rising
fast enough to raise concerns for the European Central Bank.
 Prices in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous
state, increased by 2.0 percent on an annual basis --
accelerating from a rate of 1.8 percent the previous month.
 ""The last time the price index surpassed 2 percent was in
October 2008,"" the state said in a statement, adding that

 Due to its heavy weighting in the national index of consumer
prices, the state's sharp rise suggest Germany's annual
inflation figures could surpass the ECB's target rate of close
to 2 percent, as predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
 The states of Hesse, Brandenburg and Saxony increased at an
annual rate of between 1.5 to 1.9 percent, also driven by higher
costs for heating oil and seasonal foodstuffs.
 Preliminary data for the country based on data from six

 Simon Johnson
 STOCKHOLM, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy made a strong
start to 2011, data showed on Thursday, fuelling expectations of
steeper interest rates hikes and pushing the crown currency to a
fresh 10-year high against the euro.
 Consumer and business confidence rose from already high
levels in January, while jobless figures showed the labour
market still on a positive trend.
 ""Growth looks good for the beginning of 2011 as well,"" said
Torbjorn Isaksson, analyst at Nordea. ""Inflation expectations
are high and inflation is becoming a growing theme.""
 Sweden has bounced back swiftly from its worst recession
since World War Two, with the government saying output probably
grew around 6 percent in 2010 and will likely expand around 4
percent this year.
 The central bank raised its key interest rate four times in
2010 as it looked to normalise policy after adopting an
ultra-loose monetary stance during the downturn.
 It has forecast the repo rate, currently at 1.25 percent,
will rise to 2.0 percent by year end, but many analysts believe
the Riksbank will have to move faster.
 The Swedish crown hit a 10-year high of 8.8280 to the euro
after the data, topping a peak hit earlier this month. It was
trading at 8.8465 at 0931 GMT.
 Yields on 10-year Swedish debt were broadly unchanged, as
was the spread over German 10-year bonds.
 ""We think that very positive news is already priced in to
the bond market,"" said Par Magnusson, analyst at RBS.
 The central bank next meets on interest rates on Feb. 14,
with its decision published the following day.
 Swedish consumer confidence rose to 23.7 points in January
from 20.8 points in December, topping the 21.0 points seen by
analysts, the National Institute of Economic Research said.
 More companies plan to take on extra staff than to lay
employees off during the first quarter, the data also showed.
 Inflation expectations over the coming 12 months inched up
to 2.8 percent in January from 2.7 percent in December.
 Price pressure has not been a worry for the Riksbank, which
has an inflation target of 2.0 percent, but that may change.
 On Wednesday, deputy governor Barbro Wickman-Parak said
rapid growth meant ""strained resource utilization and a risk of
excessive high inflation,"" could emerge in the longer term.
 Separate data showed unemployment rose to 7.4 percent in
December from 7.1 percent the previous month, marginally higher
than the 7.3 percent seen in a Reuters poll of analysts though
the number of employed .
 Seasonally adjusted unemployment was flat at 7.8 percent
compared with November and down from 8.9 percent a year ago.
 ""(The) job survey was fairly market neutral ... but it

market,"" said Swedbank's Knut Hallberg.
 Producer prices rose 2.2 percent month-on-month and were up
4.3 percent on the year, the statistics office said.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto	
 TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's cut Japan's
credit rating on Thursday for the first time since 2002, saying
Tokyo lacked a plan to deal with its mounting debt, in a warning
that will rattle other heavily indebted rich nations.	
 The agency reduced Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating
by one notch to AA minus, three levels below the highest
possible rating. It said Japan's fast-ageing population,
persistent deflation and the loss of the coalition's upper house
majority had compounded the government's fiscal challenge.	
 Politicians and credit ratings agencies have been warning
for years that Japan needs to lower its public debt, by far the
worst among rich nations at double the size of its $5 trillion
economy, but progress has proved elusive.	
 The ratings cut is a forceful reminder of the fragile
financial state some rich nations are in following the global
credit crisis.	
 The U.S. budget deficit is expected to blow out to a record
$1.5 trillion this year and debt worries in Europe have already
prompted financial rescues of Greece and Ireland.	
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan has made tax and social
security reform top priorities and the S&P downgrade adds
pressure on him to galvanise a divided parliament.	
 Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital
Economics in London, warned of the consequences if Tokyo failed
to get its fiscal house in order.	
 ""If it looks like making a mess of this, further downgrades
will surely follow. Given the size of Japan's economy and the
current sensitivity of global financial markets to sovereign
debt concerns, the impact would be felt worldwide,"" he said.	
 ""It supports our fear that 2011 could be the year when
Japan's dire fiscal position finally impacts markets both at
home and internationally.""	
 
 The yen and Japanese government bond prices fell and the
credit default swaps spread on Japan widened after the
announcement. 
 But markets in the past have not worried too much about the
country's high debt because it is well serviced by ample
domestic savings and few foreign investors hold Japanese
government bonds (JGBs).	
 However, Japan's society is ageing quickly, so social
welfare costs will take up an increasing proportion of the
budget in the absence of reforms, which S&P said reduces Japan's
already weak fiscal flexibility.	
 S&P's downgrade leaves its credit rating on Japan one notch
below both Fitch and Moody's and on a par with countries
including China and Saudi Arabia. The new level is one notch
below Spain.	
 ""The downgrade reflects our appraisal that Japan's
government debt ratios -- already among the highest for rated
sovereigns -- will continue to rise further than we envisaged
before the global economic recession hit the country and will
peak only in the mid-2020s,"" S&P said in a statement.	
 ""In our opinion, the Democratic Party of Japan-led
government lacks a coherent strategy to address these negative
aspects of the country's debt dynamics, in part due to the
coalition having lost its majority in the upper house of
parliament last summer.""	
 Analysts say a Japanese debt default is unlikely because of
Japanese household assets of some 1,400 trillion yen, which at
three times the size of economic output provide a healthy pool
of savings to fund the borrowing.	
 ""Japan's public finance problems are a long-fuse issue. The
downgrade doesn't mean a crisis is imminent. It signals
increased vulnerability,"" said Tim Condon, head of research in
Asia for ING Financial Markets in Singapore.	
 ""Foreigners don't buy Japanese government bonds so the
crisis risk comes from Japan's death-spiral demographics. The
downgrade is bad for G3 government debt because it spotlights
their weak public finances.""	
 
 REVERBERATES	
 Japan's debt has been growing for years as it tried to
revive the economy after a property bubble burst in the early
1990s, while other developed countries are tackling massive
public debt built up during the global financial crisis.	
 Debt markets have punished fiscally weak countries in
Europe, which led to the bailouts of Greece and Ireland and even
raised questions about the future of the euro currency. Fears of
contagion have put both Portugal and Spain in the spotlight.	
 In European markets, Spanish, Irish and Italian bonds yields
were higher on the day and the cost of insuring euro zone
sovereign debt against default rose.	
 The ratings move on Japan also pushed credit default swaps
on triple-A rated debt higher, with the spread on German CDS
hitting its highest level since March 2009 at 63 bps.	
 ""It's affecting countries with high debt burdens in the euro
zone and anything that weakens the euro zone can have a knock-on
effect on Germany, even though its finances are in much better
shape,"" said Markit analyst Gavan Nolan.	
 The United States has been clinging on to its top AAA credit
rating despite worries about the expanding budget deficit, which
the Congressional Budget Office said this week would reach $1.48
trillion in fiscal 2011. 
 Japanese bonds showed a mild reaction to the S&P ratings
cut, reflecting the market view that Japan is highly unlikely to
default on its debt when its borrowings are easily funded.	
 The benchmark 10-year yield rose just 2 basis
points to 1.250 percent. However, they could come under upward
pressure, one trader said.	
 ""The downgrade today was not surprising. Japan's rating has
been constantly under threat over the past decade and many in
the market had even taken these events to buy JGBs on price
dips,"" the trader in Japan said.	
 ""But we may no longer be able to be so complacent. Japan's
finances have steadily worsened since the last downgrade under
the government's seemingly tacit approval. Yields look to rise
going forward, not down.""	
 
 OPPORTUNITY	
 Fitch Ratings said Japan's rating was supported by its
ability to fund itself, although a failure to make progress to
reduce the fiscal burden could put pressure on its ratings.	
 Moody's Investors Service reiterated its ratings, a
spokesman said. Both Fitch and Moody's have a stable outlook on
Japan.	
 S&P warned a year ago it might cut Japan's credit rating
unless it came up with a plan to deal with its debt.	
 Japan's outstanding long-term government debt is set to
reach 869 trillion yen ($10.57 trillion) at the end of March
this year, or 181 percent of gross domestic product (GDP),
Japan's Ministry of Finance says.	
 If short-term debt is added, Japan's liabilities will hit
204 percent of GDP this calendar year, larger than 137 percent
for Greece and 113 percent for Ireland, OECD figures show.	
 The government plans to issue a record 144.9 trillion yen in
bonds in the fiscal year that starts on April 1.	
 After Thursday's cut, S&P said the outlook on the long-term
rating was stable, reflecting its view that Japan's strong
external balance sheet and monetary flexibility partially offset
the pressures stemming from the fiscal side.	
 Japan's government is well aware of its debt problem but,
like administrations before it, has struggled to tackle it head
on. Just this month, Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano warned that
the country faced a fiscal dead end. He said on Thursday the S&P
move was regrettable.	
 Prime Minister Kan is pushing for a debate on increasing the
national sales tax, which at 5 percent is among the lowest among
major economies, that he says is vital to pay for huge welfare
costs.	
 Kan's key economic ministers have promised to impose fiscal
discipline, something Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reiterated
in reaction to the S&P downgrade.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hawkish policy talk in Europe and
a stark reminder in Japan of the fragile state of some developed
countries' finances combined to drive up the euro and depress
the yen on Thursday, while equities eked out modest gains.
 Wall Street looked set for a mixed start.
 Standard & Poor's surprised markets by downgrading Japan's
long-term sovereign debt one notch from AA to AA minus, citing
the country's ballooning deficit, which it said will further
reduce Tokyo's already restricted fiscal flexibility.
 The move will have a limited impact on Japan's ability to
raise money on financial markets but it raised a red flag with
investors about other leading countries' fiscal imbalances.
 ""It is not a good sign.... A major economy like Japan being
cut is not going to go down very well,"" said Mark Priest, senior
equities trader at ETX Capital.
 Among the Group of Seven industrial countries, the United
States, Britain, Italy and France are all carrying large
deficits. Only Germany is looking sound and even it felt an
impact as the cost of insuring its debt against default over
five years hit its highest since March 2009.
 Investors were also put on notice of potential tighter
monetary policy in Europe by European Central Bank rate-setter
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, who said an expected rise in imported goods
inflation could not be ignored.
 Bini Smaghi's comments went to the heart of current investor
concerns, highlighting the potential for inflation to prompt
central banks to raise interest rates at a time when low rates
are seen as key to boosting renewed economic growth.
 
 DOUBLE WHAMMY
 The yen fell broadly on the S&P move, initially prompting a
sharp recovery for the dollar against a basket of currencies. At
one point, the dollar rose more than 1 percent to 83.20 yen
before dipping back to trade at 82.92 yen, up 0.8 percent.
 Bini Smaghi, meanwhile, prompted investors to seek euros for
potential greater returns from higher interest rates.
 The euro rose a quarter of a percent to more than $1.37 and
gained more than 1 percent against the yen to 113.87 yen.
 ""The ECB has started to show more concern about secondary
price pressures, and the market has acknowledged that,"" said
Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 Equity investors were less moved, although initially the S&P
cut set off some wobbles.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were up around 0.1 percent.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was up 0.2
percent.
 Before the S&P announcement, Japan's Nikkei average gained
0.7 percent.
 Euro zone government debt yields rose as investors sold
bonds, and the premium investors demand to hold peripheral euro
zone paper rather than German debt also widened.

 Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia Pacific sovereigns at Fitch,
said Japan's ageing population and a drawdown of savings by
households to fund retirement posed a threat to funding
conditions in the medium term.
 ""Our view is that Japan needs a fiscal consolidation strategy
to offset those negative pressures. Therefore, our focus in 2011
is whether the political situation will permit meaningful
progress on fiscal consolidation. Signs that fiscal strategy was
drifting would put downwards pressure on the ratings,"" he said in
an emailed comment to Reuters.
 Earlier on Thursday ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut
Japan's sovereign debt rating to AA minus from AA, warning that
Japan's government debt ratio would continue to rise more than it
had previously expected.
 Fitch has a local currency rating for Japan of AA minus and a
foreign currency rating of AA. The outlook is stable.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto	
 TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Rating agency Standard & Poor's
cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating on Thursday for the
first since 2002, saying the country's government lacked a
coherent plan to tackle its mounting debt.	
 It reduced the rating by one notch to AA minus, three levels
below the highest possible rating.	
 Politicians and credit ratings agencies have been warning
for years that Japan needs to lower its public debt pile, by far
the worst among rich nations at double the size of its economy,
but progress has proved elusive.	
 The yen fell broadly and credit default swaps on Japan
widened after the announcement. Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano,
who this month said Japan's faced a fiscal dead end, said S&P's
move was regrettable.	
 ""The downgrade reflects our appraisal that Japan's
government debt ratios -- already among the highest for rated
sovereigns -- will continue to rise further than we envisaged
before the global economic recession hit the country and will
peak only in the mid-2020s,"" S&P said in a statement.	
 ""In our opinion, the Democratic Party of Japan-led
government lacks a coherent strategy to address these negative
aspects of the country's debt dynamics, in part due to the
coalition having lost its majority in the upper house of
parliament last summer.""	
 The yen fell broadly, with the dollar rising 1 percent on
the day against the Japanese currency to a session high of 83.20
, and 10-year Japanese government bond futures
dipped.	
 
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said he wanted to convey the
message that Japan would stick to fiscal discipline so as to win
market confidence in its fiscal management. 
Asked about the yen's fall following the downgrade, Noda
declined to comment directly, but said currencies make various
moves from day to day.	
 While other developed countries are tackling massive public
debt built up during the global financial crisis, Japan's debt
has been growing for years as it tried to revive the economy
after a massive property bubble burst in the early 1990s.	
 ""Japan, compared to other developed economies, has the worst
fiscal position. Having said that, the reason why Japan was able
to sustain its ratings for so long is the fact that the
proportion of domestically owned debt was the highest at more
than 90 percent or so,"" said Thomas Lam, group chief economist
at DMG & Partners Securities Pte Ltd in Singapore.	
 ""I don't think this is a shocking downgrade. This is the
signal that rating agencies are looking closely at the debt and
they should do something about this, otherwise they will
eventually face a bigger problem than Europe if they take this
for granted.""	
 S&P said the outlook on the long-term rating was stable,
reflecting its view that Japan's strong external balance sheet
and monetary flexibility partially offset the pressures stemming
from the fiscal side.	
 Japan's outstanding long-term government debt is set to
reach 869 trillion yen ($10.57 trillion) at the end of March
this year, or 181 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), the
Ministry of Finance says.	
 If short-term debt is added, Japan's liabilities will hit
204 percent of GDP this calendar year, larger than 137 percent
for Greece and 113 percent for Ireland, according to the OECD.

(Adds quotes, background)
 By Dmitry Zhdannikov
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Russia will face high
inflation risks throughout the first half of the year, central
bank first deputy chairman Alexei Ulyukayev has said, fanning
investor expectations of an interest rate hike next week.
 Consumer prices in Russia have surged since the worst summer
drought in a century killed a third of the crop, and authorities
are increasingly worried as inflation -- a key concern for
voters ahead of December parliamentary elections -- spills over
beyond food.
 ""I think inflation risks are high, they increased at the end
of last year - the start of this year, both statistically and
for fundamental reasons,"" Ulyukayev said late on Wednesday on
the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 The central bank late last year switched the focus of its
rhetoric to fretting about rising prices from the need to
stimulate economic growth with record low interest rates.
 In December, it hiked deposit rates and analysts expect the
next tightening move on Monday, Jan. 31 -- possibly to include
the benchmark refinancing rate as well. [ID:nLDE70N0VR]
 ""It seems, this situation with high risks will last for a
few more months. A lot will depend ... on how we act. But I
think that it is quite likely that this trend will last ...
until the middle of the year,"" Ulyukayev said.
 ""We do not say anything about our plans. We evaluate the
risks and will take our decisions based on that.""
 Consumer prices jumped 1.8 percent in the first 24 days of
the month, already exceeding the 1.6 percent rise in the whole
of last January and signalling the central bank may struggle to
meet its 6-7 percent target for inflation for all of 2011.
[ID:nMSC000141]
 One concern, though, is that higher rates could stifle a
nascent pick up in lending -- seen as key to economic recovery.
 German Gref, the CEO of Russia's biggest lender Sberbank
 said it was too soon for the central bank to raise
interest rates this month.
 ""The trend (of rising inflation) already exists, but I think
it is too soon to fret, there is still time,"" Gref said.
 ""You can probably slowly start to raise the rate in the
first quarter, but not starting from January.""

 * Dollar index near 10-week low
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The euro clung near a two-month
high on Thursday after the Federal Reserve showed it was in no
rush to scale back its easy policy, leaving the European Central
Bank's stance looking comparatively hawkish.
 The contrast between the Fed's emphasis on efforts to cure
high unemployment and the ECB's growing concern about inflation
could keep the euro in an uptrend from a four-month low hit
earlier in the month.
 Still, the currency's two-week-long rally faces a growing
risk of overstretching in the near term with resistance seen
looming around $1.3740-3786, analysts said.
 The euro held flat at $1.3710 on Thursday, still within
sight of a two-month high of $1.3723 marked on Wednesday and an
option barrier said to be around $1.3725.
 Its near-term resistance includes a 61.8 percent retracement
of its two-month decline until early January, around $1.3740, as
well as its Nov. 22 high of $1.3786.
 The Fed voted unanimously to hold interest rates steady and
repeated that rates would remain exceptionally low for an
extended period, offering only a very slight upgrade to its
assessment of the U.S. economy.
 ""The Fed didn't really stress an improvement in the economy.
Because some market players had speculated that the Fed could
become more hawkish, the dollar slipped back,"" said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ECB Governor Jean-Claude Trichet may also take a clear
stance on exiting the bank's current easy policy after a meeting
next week, likely giving the euro fresh impetus, said Daisuke
Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
 Uno said the euro was likely to rise to around $1.38-39 some
time next week, noting that a break of its Nov. 22 high of
$1.3786 would probably push the euro into a new trading range
around $1.38-40.
 But in the very short term the euro may peak on Friday, he
said, noting that by then the currency's uptrend will have
lasted nine business days -- the average length for its recent
uptrends.
 The euro's rally even from a four-month low of $1.2860 set
on Jan. 10 has come without a major adjustment, it having risen
in 12 of the last 13 sessions.
 And the last few sessions have seen it forming a rising
wedge on the charts. This is a bearish pattern, normally
associated with the imminent reversal of a prevailing trend.
 On some crosses the euro is already starting to lose steam.
 The euro slipped to around 1.2919 franc from a six-week high
of 1.3068 hit on Friday and again on Monday.
 Against the yen, it has been blocked at resistance around
113 yen.
 The euro has been helped by signs of some stability in euro
zone periphery countries' bond markets but many market players
also say doubts remain on whether these nations can stand on
their own feet.
 The dollar changed hands at 82.20 yen, showing little sign
of breaking out of its recent 82.00-83.50 yen range.
 Strong bids at and below 82 yen, including buying related to
an options barrier at 82 yen, are keeping its decline in check,
traders said.
 But if the currency breaks below 81.85, a low hit last week,
many traders are likely to shake off entrenched expectations of
rangebound trade.
 The dollar also failed to capitalise on a rise in U.S. bond
yields after the Fed. The correlation between U.S. two-year
yields and the dollar/yen rate has completely broken down since
late last year.
 ""A breakdown in the correlation happens from time to time so
it's not a surprise. But it does indicate waning demand for the
dollar now,"" said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at J.P. Morgan
Chase.
 Sasaki said this reflected broad weakness in the dollar, as
safe-haven dollar demand is waning due to favourable global
market conditions.
 The dollar index against a basket of major currencies
hovered at 77.739, just above a 10-week low of 77.689 hit on
Wednesday.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent after traders used an
announcement of a new temporary tax to fund a rebuilding
programme after devastating floods in the country as an excuse
to sell the currency.
 Still, the Aussie has been stuck in a rough range between
$0.98 and $1.02 since the start of the year.
 The currency's slide cut into gains in the New Zealand
dollar, which had risen to a one-week high of $0.7746 earlier
after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said rates were still
likely to climb over the next couple of years.

 By Ian Chua	
 SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held near 2-1/2
month lows on Thursday, while commodity prices and Asian stocks
rose after U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers voted unanimously
to maintain a $600 billion bond-buying plan to fuel an economic
recovery.	
 While the outcome of the Fed meeting was largely expected,
it backed the view that a wave of liquidity seeking higher
returns would continue to flow into riskier assets.	
 ""In this sort of environment, you look for growth assets. So
investors are looking to park their money in investments that
will provide good returns over time. As a result, equities and
commodities are high up on the list,"" said Craig James, chief
economist at CommSec in Sydney.	
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.7 percent, while
stocks elsewhere in Asia climbed 0.3 percent to
their best level in a week.	
 Chinese shares advanced for a second day, with Shanghai's
key stock index up 1 percent, but fresh measures to cool
China's real estate market knocked property stocks lower. South
Korea's KOSPI hit a record high.	
 Among the underperformers was the Australian market ,
which closed a touch lower after the government announced a new
income tax to help fund a multi-billion-dollar rebuilding
programme for flood-devastated areas.	
 
 Policymakers at the U.S. central bank unanimously agreed to
continue with the bond purchases, the first time there was no
dissent since December 2009.	
 The Fed, concerned about high unemployment, also said
underlying U.S. inflation was trending downwards, despite higher
commodity prices, contrasting in tone to other central banks,
particularly those in emerging markets.	
 Rising price pressures have already forced the likes of
India and South Korea to lift rates this year and more action is
expected in the months ahead, fuelling worries that tighter
policy could derail growth.	
 Those concerns have dealt a heavy blow to several
Southeast Asian stock markets in the past few weeks, with
investors locking in profits on last year's stellar gains. 
 But a bounceback in these markets this week suggested some
investors consider the sell-down was overdone.	
 Still, for markets to continue to perform, ""investors need
assurance that inflation can be contained without tighter
monetary policy stifling growth"", said SooHai Lim, investment
manager of Baring ASEAN Frontiers Fund.	
 ""We believe the positive story for the Association of South
East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the frontier markets, spearheaded
by Sri Lanka and Vietnam, has not changed.""	
 
 DOLLAR SAGS	
 The dollar index , which measures the performance of
the greenback against a basket of major currencies, slipped back
to lows not seen since Nov. 11. It last traded down 0.3 percent
at 77.727.	
 ""The lack of dissent (among FOMC members) suggests that the
committee remains as dovish as previously, showing few concerns
on inflation or likelihood to reverse aggressively accommodative
monetary policy,"" said David Rodriguez, strategist at DailyFX.	
 ""The U.S. dollar could continue to decline on dovish outlook
for domestic monetary policy.""	
 U.S. President Barack Obama, in his State of the Union
address late on Tuesday, called for investment in some areas and
cuts in others to make the U.S. economy more competitive.	
 The euro held above $1.3700 , having risen to $1.3721
overnight, a high last seen on Nov. 22, while the dollar eased
to 82.17 yen , hovering near one-week lows around 81.96
set earlier in the week.	
 Copper on the London Metal Exchange climbed 1.2
percent to $9,437 a tonne, not far off a record high around
$9,781.00 set earlier this month.	
 U.S. crude was a touch lower on the day but still
above $87 a barrel, some distance off Wednesday's two-month low
of $86.03.

 SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States
have finalised the text of a free trade deal, the trade ministry
in Seoul said, clearing another hurdle for the ratification of
the controversial agreement.	
 The trade ministry said in a statement the two countries
plan to officially sign the document in the middle of next
month, before sending it to their respective legislatures for
final approval to end years of negotiations.	
 U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday called on Congress to
pass the deal ""as soon as possible"", as Washington strives to
enact the agreement before a rival trade pact between Seoul and
the European Union comes into force on July 1.	
 Obama's specific call for Congress to pass the South Korean
agreement followed a recent renegotiation to address concerns
raised by the U.S. auto industry.	
 It had complained the original version failed to tear down
barriers to South Korea's auto market, while phasing out
remaining U.S. tariffs on South Korean cars.	
 Under the revised terms, South Korea and the United States
have also agreed to delay the elimination of tariffs on American
pork for two years.	
 The U.S. International Trade Commission estimated in 2007
that the Korean agreement would boost U.S. exports by about $10
billion to $11 billion annually, while increasing imports from
that country by about $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion. 
 
 AUTOS AGREED	
 Late last year, the Obama administration renegotiated the
auto provisions of the agreement to win the support of the
United Auto Workers labor union and Ford Motor Co , which
previously had opposed the pact.	
 Those changes mean winning approval of the pact will no
longer be as ""horribly difficult"" as it once was, but it will
still face stiff opposition in Congress, U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk said earlier this month.	
 The U.S. will eliminate its 2.5 percent tariff on Korean
cars within four years, instead of immediately or after three
years as was previously agreed, after the deal takes effect.	
 South Korea will cut its 8 percent tariff on U.S. car
imports to 4 percent, instead of eliminating it immediately and
soften regulations on automotive safety and environmental
standards.
 A range of U.S. companies and industry groups have spoken
out in support of the South Korea deal, including the United
Auto Workers union and Ford Motor Co., which welcomed changes
made to address their concerns about market access provisions of
the original deal.	
 The pact with South Korea is the biggest of three trade
agreements negotiated by the administration of former President
George W. Bush but which have stalled in Congress because of
strong opposition from Democrats.	
 A wide swath of U.S. farm, manufacturing and service
industry groups support the agreement. But the AFL-CIO, the
country's main labour organisation, remains opposed to it.

 * Euro may soon test Nov. 22 high of $1.3786
 * Dollar index near 10-week low
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The euro clung near a two-month
high on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve showed no haste
to scale back its easy policy, disappointing some dollar bulls
who had expected slightly more hawkish language.
 The contrast between the Fed's emphasis on efforts to cure
high unemployment and the European Central Bank's growing
concerns on inflation could help the euro test its Nov. 22 high
of $1.3786, analysts said.
 The euro was flat at $1.3705 in early Asian trade on
Thursday, within sight of a 2-month high of $1.3723 hit on
Wednesday and an option barrier at $1.3725.
 The Fed voted unanimously to hold interest rates steady and
repeated that rates would remain exceptionally low for an
extended period, offering only a very slight upgrade to its
assessment of the U.S. economy.
 ""The Fed didn't really stress an improvement in the economy.
Because some market players had speculated that the Fed could
become more hawkish, the dollar slipped back,"" said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital.
 For the euro, however, many analysts see more near-term
upside, noting signs of some stability in euro zone periphery
countries' bond markets.
 ""The downside risk for the euro is retreating. The euro could
rise to around $1.38 in the near term. There could be some
adjustments but we expect the euro to rise to around $1.40,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ECB Governor Jean-Claude Trichet may also show a clear stance
towards exiting the bank's current easy policy after a policy
meeting next week, said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp.
 Uno said the euro was likely to rise to around $1.38-39 next
week, noting that a break of its Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 would
probably push the euro into a new trading range around $1.38-40.
 But other market players suspect the euro could step back in
the near term as its rally from a four-month low of $1.2860 set
on Jan. 10 has come without a major adjustment.
 The dollar changed hands at 82.20 yen, showing little sign of
breaking out of its recent 82.00-83.50 yen range.
 Strong bids at and below 82 yen should keep its decline in
check, traders said but added that if it does break below 81.85,
a low last week, they would have to shake off entrenched
expectations of range-bound trade.
 The dollar index against a basket of major currencies hovered
at 77.748, just above a 10-week low of 77.689 hit on Wednesday.

 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Japan's annual export growth picked
up more strongly than expected in December as shipments to China
jumped to a record high and auto demand in the United States
recovered, reinforcing views that the economy will soon emerge
from a lull.
 The data backs up the Bank of Japan's forecast that the
export-reliant economy will resume a recovery early this year
following a short pause brought on by slowing overseas growth and
the expiry of stimulus measures.
 The central bank's somewhat upbeat take on the economy on
Tuesday, following its decision to keep rates on hold, further
dampened any expectations of an imminent monetary easing.
 But lacklustre domestic demand is likely to cause the central
bank to stick to its ultra-loose policy for years to come,
economists say.
 ""Exports in December turned out to be pretty good thanks to
solid demand from China as well as brisk U.S. consumption during
the Christmas holidays,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at
Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo.
 ""Exports will firm up in January-March but downside risks
remain, such as inflation in emerging economies and persistent
yen strength.""
 SHIPMENTS TO CHINA
 Exports rose 13 percent in December from a year earlier, more
than economists' median forecast for a 9.2 percent annual rise.
Imports increased 10.6 percent from a year earlier against an
expected annual rise of 12.0 percent, Ministry of Finance data
showed on Thursday.
 Brisk shipments to the United States aided overall export
growth as auto demand recovered, supporting budding optimism
about the U.S. economic recovery, while strong demand from China
also provided a boost.
 U.S.-bound exports climbed 16.5 percent in December from a
year earlier to post their fastest increase since July.
 Shipments to China jumped 20.1 percent annually in December
to a record high 1.29 trillion yen ($15.70 billion) as machinery
and other factory goods were in hot demand, underscoring the
Japanese economy's growing reliance on China.
 China, whose economy likely overtook Japan's in 2010 as the
world's second largest, remained Japan's biggest trading partner
for the full year for a second straight year with exports
climbing 27.9 percent to a record 13 trillion yen ($158 billion).
 ""There is a growing view that the U.S. economic recovery will
pick up... I think demand from Asia will continue to grow this
year if Asian central banks manage to control inflation,"" said
Yoshimasa Maruyama, economist at Itochu Corp.
 ""I don't see the Bank of Japan adopting additional easing
steps from an economic point of view,"" he added, although he did
not rule out political pressure on the bank to expand its asset
buying scheme given the country's persistent deflation.
 The real exports index calculated by the BOJ to track changes
in export volume rose 7.3 percent in December from the previous
month, posting its first increase in five months and its fastest
growth since April 2009.
 The central bank is seen paying close attention to export
data as it tries to gauge when the economy will come out of its
current doldrums. The BOJ this week maintained its assessment hat
economic growth is pausing, even after the government upgraded
its views.
 Exports have hit a soft patch since last summer as the yen
jumped to 15-year highs and key economies such as the United
States and China slowed.
 The trade balance in December came to a surplus of 727.7
billion yen, up 34.1 percent from a year earlier. That compared
with the median forecast for a 450.0 billion yen surplus.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - World stocks and crude oil
gained on Wednesday, shrugging off a lukewarm outlook from the
Federal Reserve, as investors latched onto the growth prospects
of U.S. President Barack Obama's pledge to trim spending.
 The U.S. dollar slipped and government bond prices pared
some losses after the Fed said high unemployment still
justified its $600 billion bond-buying program, despite recent
signs of a strengthening recovery. For details see:
[ID:nN25283937]
 The broad S&P 500 Index closed at a 29-month high, led by
gains in commodity and tech shares, as investors largely
ignored the Fed's latest assessment of the U.S. economy.
[ID:nN26129746]
 The Fed's outlook after a two-day meeting of policymakers
came on the heels of a government report that showed new-home
sales rose to an eight-month high in December, just the latest
data to signal a pick-up in economic activity.
 ""The market is not willing to buy into the Fed's vision,""
said Jim Vogel, interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in
Memphis.
 Strong corporate earnings continue to support further gains
in equity markets, while commodities rebounded from sharp
losses the previous session on optimism about demand and supply
snags.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.6 percent.
 The Reuters Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, one of the broadest
measures of commodity prices, settled up 1.6 percent for its
strongest gain since Dec. 31. [ID:nN26261606]
 ""By expressing disappointment about the employment
situation, the Federal Reserve is signaling that it will
continue to inject liquidity into the economy,"" said Mohamed
El-Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment
Management Co. in Newport Beach, California.
 ""Only part of this liquidity will be absorbed by the U.S.
economy. The rest will leak elsewhere, resulting in large
capital flows to emerging economies and pressure on commodity
prices,"" he said.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
closed up 8.25 points, or 0.07 percent, at 11,985.44. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 5.45 points, or 0.42
percent, at 1,296.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose
20.25 points, or 0.74 percent, at 2,739.50.
 The Dow rose above the 12,000 level intraday for the first
time since June 2008 before it pared those gains to close just
above break-even.
 Stocks in Tokyo were poised to open flat, with the March
futures contract that trades in Chicago for the Nikkei 225
<0#NK:> at 10,455, or break-even.
 Obama's annual State of the Union speech late Tuesday
helped bolster sentiment as the president signaled corporate
tax cuts, a retooling of the tax code and an end to pet
spending projects coveted by many lawmakers. [ID:nN2690910]
 Investors also ignored a report from the Congressional
Budget Office, which said the U.S. budget deficit in 2011 will
jump nearly 40 percent over prior forecasts, mostly due to the
mammoth tax-cut package brokered by Obama and lawmakers in
December. [ID:nN26141556]
 Data that showed new U.S. single-family home sales surged
to their highest level in eight months in December while prices
were the highest since April 2008 also bolstered sentiment and
raised cautious optimism for a housing market recovery.
[ID:nN26177281]
 A weaker-than-expected outlook from Boeing Co  pulled
its shares down 3.1 percent to $70.02 and weighed on the Dow.
[ID:nN26123271]
 The dollar pared gains against the yen immediately after
the Fed statement, dropping to 82.20, but it rebounded to
session highs as U.S. benchmark yields rose.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 23/32 in price to yield 3.42 percent.
 The dollar  was up 0.05 percent at 82.24 yen, while
the euro  was up 0.07 percent at $1.3698.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.29 percent at 77.779.
 U.S. crude for March delivery  settled $1.14 higher,
or 1.32 percent, at $87.33 a barrel, rebounding after six
straights days of losses on rising inventories as well as
worries about global economic recovery.
 In London, the March contract for Brent crude 
settled up $2.66 at $97.91 a barrel.
 Brent's premium  against U.S. benchmark crude
soared to a 24-month high of more than $10, the widest since
January 2009.
 U.S. gold futures for February delivery  settled up
70 cents at $1,333 an ounce prior to the Fed's announcement.

 NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on
Wednesday, with weakness expected to continue the rest of the
week after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low and gave
a tepid assessment of the U.S. economy that ensured its
Treasury bond-buying program remains in place until June.
 The euro briefly rose above $1.3700 but gave up those gains
as profit-taking set in ahead of a touted options barrier at
$1.3725. If that goes, then $1.3738 is in focus, which is the
61.8 percent retracement of the decline from $1.4283 in
November to $1.2860 hit in January.
 Beyond that, the Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 is seen as a major
target.
 The dollar also pared gains against the yen immediately
after the Fed's statement, dropping to 82.20 from 82.50 before
the statement. But it rebounded as U.S. benchmark yields rose.
 In a statement, the Fed, which voted unanimously at a
regular policy meeting to hold interest rates steady, said the
U.S. economic recovery, while continuing, has been
""insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor
market conditions."" It repeated that rates will remain
exceptionally low for an extended period. For more see
[ID:nN25283937].
 ""I would say that the market was expecting nothing
substantial, but most likely some cautious optimism in the
announcement, which they did not get,"" said Nana Dahlerup,
global head of spot FX at Saxobank in Copenhagen.
 ""Hence the market took the euro up, but the euro is looking
somewhat heavy above $1.37 with plenty of sellers emerging,
taking it right back down and taking out the short-term
longs.""
 The Fed also gave a nod to pressures from rising commodity
prices but said measures of underlying inflation remained
""somewhat low."" This was in sharp contrast to the European
Central Bank's view that the recent surge in commodity
inflation posed a threat to the region's inflation.
 ""In general, though, I would say the U.S. economy hasn't
really changed that much,"" said Hidetoshi Yanagihara, senior
currency trader at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
 ""The one thing is that the situation here is different from
in Europe, where (ECB chief Jean-Claude) Trichet has been more
hawkish on price pressures. That's one reason why the euro
could appreciate more.""
 In late afternoon trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index
fell 0.3 percent to 77.779 <.DXY>.
 The euro was little changed at $1.3691  after
hitting a high at $1.3723, just shy of the $1.3725 barrier.
There are reportedly sell orders above that at $1.3735-40.
 The euro has gained 2.36 percent on the year so far after
plunging 6.6 percent in 2010.
 As the euro recovers, volatility on one-month euro/dollar
dropped to four-month lows on Wednesday just below 11.0 percent
, suggesting investors are getting less nervous about
sovereign debt problems in the euro zone.

 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand also kept rates unchanged
at 3.0 percent, as expected, reaffirming that rates are likely
to rise modestly over the next two years. [ID:nWEL004246]

zone's rescue fund must include all member states and discourage
markets from speculating against the euro, the European Union's
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner said.
 Olli Rehn told German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
it was not yet clear how the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) should be beefed up without raising its nominal
volume beyond the figure of 440 billion euros at present.
 ""There are various options, like higher guarantees or
capital payments into the EFSF. What's clear is that all states
must be involved. It can't be that AAA that states bear the
burden alone,"" Rehn said in an interview with the paper.
 Policymakers are seeking to find ways to maximise the full
capacity of the EFSF, whose effective lending clout is really
only about 250 billion euros because of the guarantee system
required to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 In comments due to appear in the paper's Thursday edition,
Rehn said it was important to boost the fund's power.
 ""We have to prove credibly to markets that there cannot be
any speculation against the euro,"" Rehn said. ""It also needs to
be clear that short selling is not worth it.""
 EU finance ministers agreed last week to take their time
over beefing up the euro zone's rescue fund, in a go-slow
approach which could test the patience of investors.
 Rehn said he did not favour restructuring Greece's debts
because this would create even greater economic problems, adding
that this would be avoided.
 However, he conceded that markets were concerned about
whether Greece would be able to redeem its bonds.
 ""That's why we've proposed to give Athens, like with Dublin,
seven years to pay back its aid,"" Rehn said.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - World stocks and crude oil
rose on Wednesday after U.S. President Barack Obama's pledge to
trim deficit spending added to optimism that the Federal
Reserve will retain its stimulative monetary policy.
 None expect the Fed to alter its benchmark interest rate at
the end of a two-day meeting of policymakers on Wednesday, but
investors hope the focus will remain on supporting economic
growth with $600 billion in purchases of government debt. For

 Obama's annual State of the Union speech Tuesday helped
bolster sentiment as the president signaled corporate tax cuts,
a retooling of the tax code and an end to pet spending projects
coveted by many lawmakers. [ID:nN2690910]
 European equities hit a one-week closing high and the
iconic Dow Jones industrial average rose above the 12,000 level
for the first time since June 2008 before paring gains to trade
at breakeven.
 But the broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index and world stocks
rose, with MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> up
almost 0.5 percent.
 In Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index
of top shares finished 0.8 percent firmer at 1,152.71 points,
the highest close since hitting a 28-month peak on Jan. 18.
 ""Obama is trying to convey his hopes that the health of
corporate America is important,"" said Keith Bowman, equity
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown in London. ""He would like to
simplify the tax system and keep corporate tax rates low. That
has been taken well by investors.""
 Data that showed new U.S. single-family home sales surged
to their highest level in eight months in December while prices
were the highest since April 2008 also bolstered sentiment and
raised cautious optimism for a housing market recovery.
[ID:nN26177281]
 Investors were unfazed by a report from the Congressional
Budget Office, which said the U.S. budget deficit in 2011 will
jump nearly 40 percent over prior forecasts, mostly due to the
mammoth tax-cut package brokered by Obama and lawmakers in
December. [ID:nN26141556]
 Wall Street stock gains were limited by Boeing Co ,
whose shares fell 3.4 percent after the planemaker gave a
weaker-than-expected outlook. [ID:nN26123271] Boeing dragged on
the Dow.
 Shortly before 12:30 p.m. (1730 GMT), the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was up 8.51 points, or 0.07 percent,
at 11,985.70. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up
4.70 points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,295.88. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> was up 16.68 points, or 0.61 percent, at
2,735.93.
 Analysts said Fed policymakers are likely to acknowledge a
recent improvement in the U.S. economy, which should supply
support for the U.S. dollar.
 ""The Fed is expected to keep policy on hold today, leaving
the tone of the statement the major risk,"" said Sacha Tihanyi,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 But the dollar was down against major currencies, with the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.23 percent at 77.826.
 The euro  was up 0.05 percent at $1.3696, after
sliding as low as $1.3643  on trading platform EBS,
off an earlier two-month high at $1.3723.
 U.S. crude held above $86 a barrel and Brent rose more than
$1 as a weaker dollar ahead of the Fed statement and rising
equities countered a big rise in U.S. crude inventories.
[ID:nLDE70P1R2]
 U.S. crude briefly turned negative after the U.S. Energy
Information Administration reported a 4.84 million-barrel rise
in crude stocks. Still, some analysts said that was unlikely to
stand in the way of higher prices. [EIA/S]
 U.S. crude  was up 51 cents at $86.70, while Brent
crude  gained $2.01 to $97.26.
 U.S. Treasuries  widened losses after a report
showing that new home sales jumped in December.
[ID:nN26361617]
 The U.S. Commerce Department said sales of new
single-family homes rose 17.5 percent in December on a
seasonally adjusted basis to an annualized 329,000.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 20/32 in price to yield 3.41 percent.
 German government bond prices fell, weighed by poor demand
at a 30-year Bund auction and a fall in gilt prices after
hawkish Bank of England policy minutes revived some rate hike
bets in the UK. [ID:nLDE70P2BK]
 Two-year German bonds yielded their most in about 14 months
at 1.334 percent . Prices
 Spot gold prices  fell $6.20 to $1,327.20 an ounce.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> fell 0.5 percent, giving
back some of the previous day's 1 percent rally. The MSCI index
of Asian stocks outside Japan <.MIAPJ00000PUS> rose 0.6
percent.

 * Zamrazilova has voted for hike in last three meetings
 * Governor Singer: tough to say when rates will rise

(Adds central bank governor's comments)
 PRAGUE, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A board member of the Czech
central bank who has been a lone advocate of higher interest
rates has called for a clear signal the financial crisis is
over, but the bank's governor on Wednesday gave no clue on when
rates might rise.
 In an interview published late on Tuesday on the website of
newspaper Hospodarske Noviny, bank board member Eva Zamrazilova
said current Czech interest rates had been appropriate during
the crisis but no longer.
 She said she saw a neutral rate in the current conditions at
between 1 percent and 1.5 percent.
 The Czechs have not yet followed the Hungarian or Polish
central banks which have already started tightening policy after
two years of loosening to get through the global economic
downturn.
 Speaking to a students' seminar on Wednesday, central bank
Governor Miroslav Singer repeated comments from earlier in the
week, saying inflationary pressures existed but the strong crown
currency was taming them.
 Singer said it was impossible to say when rates would start
to rise.
 ""I do not know, I am not able to answer this (when rates
will rise),"" Singer said in a question-and-answer session.
 ""At this moment, there are signs that inflation pressures
are starting to move in one direction, on the other hand the
crown is starting to firm strongly.""
 The bank has kept the key rate at 0.75 percent since May.
Zamrazilova has been the lone vote for a 25 basis point rate
hike at each of the last three meetings since September.
 She has said that long-term loose policy was a risk for
financial stability.
 ""A neutral rate in the current conditions, I see somewhere
between...1 percent and 1.5 percent,"" Zamrazilova was quoted as
saying in the interview.
 ""The current setting of rates was adequate to the crisis
situation, now a clear signal that the crisis is over is
needed.""
 The board meets on policy again on Feb. 3. Analysts have
mostly seen rates staying stable next week. Markets are pricing
in a rate hike within six months.
 The crown has led gains among central European currencies so
far this year, rising 3.4 percent to near highs last touched in
November 2008.
 Singer's comments followed hawkish remarks by central bank
board member Pavel Rezabek earlier this month.

 * Wariness before Fed; policy seen staying accommodative
(Updates prices, adds details, comment)
 NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The euro was little changed
against the dollar on Wednesday after earlier hitting a
two-month high as investors adjusted positions ahead of the
Federal Reserve's policy statement later in the day.
 None expect the U.S. central bank to announce any change in
its benchmark interest rate, but investors are cautious and
looking for confirmation from the Fed that its focus remains on
supporting growth and not on inflation.
 Any acknowledgment from the Fed of a recent improvement in
the U.S. economy is likely to push the euro lower again as much
of the single currency's recent rally was based on the belief
the Fed will stick to an easier monetary policy than the
European Central Bank.
 ""The Fed is expected to keep policy on hold today, leaving
the tone of the statement the major risk,"" said Sacha Tihanyi,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
""Acknowledging an improved inflation situation may provide U.S.
dollar support.""
 The euro fell to a session low against the dollar after the
Commerce Department reported that sales of new U.S.
single-family home in December rose to their highest level in
eight months and prices were the highest since April 2008,
raising cautious optimism for a housing market recovery..
 The euro rose to $1.3723 on trading platform EBS, its
highest since Nov. 22, before dipping back to $1.3688, little
changed from the prior close. The session low was $1.3643.
 Traders said a large option barrier was taken out at
$1.3720, with more barriers highlighted at $1.3725 and $1.3750.
Stop-losses were reportedly lurking above the latter level.
 The euro stalled ahead of a key technical level around
$1.3740, the 61.8 percent retracement of its fall from November
to January. Beyond that, the Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 is seen as
a major target.
 ""The euro got a boost on an anti-inflation focus but (euro
zone) sovereign risk is still a significant overhang,"" said
Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Washington-based
Tempus Consulting. ""Overall there is optimism on the U.S.
economy.""
 Salvaggio said he was surprised to see the move to near
$1.3725 and expects to see the euro closer to $1.3400 next
week.
 Euro/dollar risk reversal is at 1.301, according to Reuters
data, showing a bias to euro puts and dollar calls implying
that more market participants are betting on a drop in the
currency than on a rise.
 FED FOCUS
 Analysts expect the U.S. central bank will keep short-term
rates near zero and say it remains committed to its $600
billion bond purchase program in its policy announcement, which
is expected at about 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT) after the close of
the Fed's two-day meeting.
 ""The Fed seems to have welded monetary policy to the U.S.
unemployment rate, which is still very high. Until there is
some moderation down to around 8 percent in the jobless rate
it's hard to think there could be any change in policy,"" said
Kathleen Brookes, research director at FOREX.com in London.
 The dollar was under pressure after U.S. bond yields fell
on news of President Barack Obama's proposal to freeze portions
of federal spending in his State of the Union address Tuesday
night.
 The Fed's policy outlook contrasts with that of the
European Central Bank. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has
warned about rising inflation in the region, sparking talk of a
rate hike later this year and helping to widen the euro's rate
advantage over the dollar.
 The ECB concerns come even as fiscal problems in Greece,
Ireland and Portugal weigh on economic growth.
 But the euro also continued to benefit from strong demand
for inaugural bonds from Europe's financial rescue fund on
Tuesday. Asian investors, including the Japanese government,
took up more than one-third of the 5 billion euro offer.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 82.32 yen.

 * Youth unemployment, inflation potential flashpoints
 * Gulf markets, longer-term prospects still seen positive
 
 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Mass protests in Egypt, one of
the darlings of African and Middle Eastern investors, sharply
increase the risks that international investors will withdraw
funds from some other economies in the region.
 Fund managers were relatively sanguine about the upheaval in
Tunisia which drove President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to flee
earlier this month, as Tunisia is a frontier market which
doesn't feature on many portfolio managers' radar screens.
 But they did then point to the potential for contagion
across parts of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with
Gulf markets seen as relatively insulated, but Egypt an
especially big risk.
 That contagion appears to have started.
 Egypt's currency hit a near-six year low, stocks fell 6
percent and debt insurance costs soared to their highest in 18
months on Wednesday, a day after massive ""Day of Wrath""
demonstrations called for an end to President Hosni Mubarak's
30-year rule.
 Protesters who tried to gather on Wednesday were quickly
dispersed and the government said it was banning demonstrations.
 But significant damage has been done to investor confidence.
At least $150 million left Egyptian local bond markets on
Wednesday, according to data from investment bank Citi.
 ""The more tension that develops in the Middle East and
Africa, the more readily investors will choose safety over
capital gains, and thus eschew investments in the area,"" said
Tom Dorsey, president at investment advisers Dorsey, Wright &
Assoc. 
 ""Cash is preferable over equities in Egypt today, and that
will be my path until the markets suggest otherwise."" 
 Egypt makes up only a small proportion of the benchmark MSCI
emerging equities index, but has been a favourite among both
MENA and Africa investors, due to the government's readiness to
embrace financial reforms, a young population, growing consumer
demand and relatively cheap stock market valuations.
 It also features in Goldman Sachs' N-11 list -- the next 11
economies after the BRIC economies of Brazil, Russia, India and
China, for which the U.S. investment bank sees rapid growth.

 Egypt's stock market rallied 15 percent last year and
foreigners account for around 16 percent of the Egyptian stock
exchange's total trading value over the last five years.
 But the rising young population in Egypt and elsewhere in
the region can be a double-edged sword, as a jobless population
is more likely to stir political unrest.
 Average youth unemployment in MENA is almost 30 percent,
World Bank data shows, nearly double the levels in Latin America
and eastern Europe.
 ""One of the risks in the region is destabilisation in
politics,"" said Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, head of emerging
equities at Baring Asset Management, whose MENA fund is invested
in Egypt.
 ""In Egypt, we are not there with regime change. Am I
watching it very closely? Yes. Do I know the outcome? No. Do I
think that Egyptian asset prices look attractive? Yes, but there
is no reason to rush into them.""
 
 INFLATION LINK
 Protests across the region, which have included Algeria and
Jordan as well as Egypt and Tunisia, are bound up with the price
of food.
 Rising food prices globally are even more strongly felt in
emerging markets, which tend to have a higher weighting for food
in their consumer price baskets. 
 Egypt's problems are likely to add to concern about
countries which have already seen protests, and also in
countries like Lebanon, facing a change of government, or
Nigeria which is due to hold elections this year.
 Ratings agency Fitch affirmed Egypt's rating at BB+ with a
stable outlook earlier this month, but said inflation was a
challenge.
 That stable outlook could change if prices shoot higher.
 ""If I see inflation rising sharply, that would increase the
risks,"" said Richard Fox, head of Middle East and Africa
sovereign ratings at Fitch.
 ""Egypt is less likely to spiral out of control than Tunisia,
but the key question is the momentum (of the protests).""
 Credit Suisse last week downgraded Egypt to neutral from
overweight. 
 ""In retrospect it wouldn't have been a bad idea to go
underweight,"" said Robert Ruttman, emerging equities strategist
at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 
 LONGER TERM APPEAL
 Longer term however, Egypt remains an attractive
proposition, Ruttman said, and the impact on Gulf stock markets
is likely to be limited due to small and relatively wealthy
local populations.
 ""There is less of an incentive to protest and less to gain,""
said Ruttman who remains overweight Saudi, Kuwait and United
Arab Emirates.
 Cairo-based private equity firm Citadel Capital also sees
Egypt and Algeria among four of the best African economies --
its acronym SANE covers South Africa and Nigeria also.
 ""Investing in these geographies is not for the
faint-hearted, but the compelling returns make it a core part of
any high-growth strategy,"" said Citadel Chairman Ahmed Heikal in
a note.
 ""If you want to wait until there is no risk, go invest in
Switzerland and be thankful for 1.4 percent on your 10-year
government bond.""

 * Final deal with Sonangol seen signed in May
 * Company may announce 1-2 worldwide exploration deals in Q2
 
 (Adds background)
 By Gwladys Fouche
 OSLO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil sees potential for
giant discoveries of a billion barrels of oil in one or more of
the Angolan ultra-deep water blocks, known as pre-salt blocks,
in which it gained concessions this week.
 Angola, which rivals Nigeria as the top oil producer in
Africa, awarded concessions on Monday to major companies across
11 blocks. Oil and gas producer Statoil expects to operate two
concessions and participate in three others.
 ""One or more of the blocks has one-billion-barrels-of-oil
potential,"" Tim Dodson, Statoil's head of exploration, told
Reuters on Wednesday in an interview. ""We have the potential to
make giant discoveries.""
 Dodson said he hopes Statoil will drill its first
exploration well in one of the new blocks within two years.
 The Norwegian firm said it expected to sign the final deal
about the concessions with Angola's state-owned oil firm
Sonangol in May, after which it would disclose the value of the
investments it had made in the ultra-deep water blocks.
 Statoil said it was too early to say when production in the
blocks could start. 
 It said the area appeared as promising as the ultra-deep
water projects on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean from
Angola, in Brazil.
 Angola is key to Statoil's growth as it is the largest
contributor to the firm's production outside its home base of
Norway, yielding 37 percent of its international output.
 
 NEW EXPLORATION DEALS POSSIBLE
 Statoil, Europe's second-largest gas exporter, must find new
areas to explore as production off Norway is fast declining and
the Nordic country recently cut its resource estimates by 4.4
billion barrels.
 The firm said it is maintaining its 2012 output target,
raising eyebrowns among some analysts, and that future growth
would come outside Norway.
 Dodson said Statoil may imminently announce one or two deals
over acquiring new exploration acreage worldwide.
 ""I would not be surprised if we are ready to disclose one
other deal, maybe two, probably in the second quarter... We are
making good progress.""

jobs for its young unemployed, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said in a report published on Wednesday, highlighting a
problem that has fuelled unrest throughout the region.
 Jobless young men spearheaded protests in neighbouring
Tunisia that helped to topple that country's long-serving
president, and there have been anti-government protests this
month in Egypt as well as rioting in Algeria itself.
 Energy exporter Algeria has about $150 billion in foreign
currency reserves, almost no external debt, and forecasts
economic growth of 4 percent in 2011. But the economy, dominated
by the oil and gas sector, produces too few jobs.
 ""Further reducing unemployment, especially among the young,
remains a pressing need,"" the IMF report said.
 ""Algeria's economy has continued to perform well but the
main challenge remains to ensure sustainable, diversified and
private investment-led growth to reduce unemployment further,
especially among the young,"" it said.
 According to official figures, Algeria's unemployment rate
is around 10 percent, while joblessness among the young is more
than twice that figure.
 Algeria responded to a nationwide outbreak of rioting over
price rises early this month by reducing the price of some
staple foodstuffs. But the potential remains for new unrest.
 ""There are still some underlying tensions (in Algeria)
related to high unemployment among the youth,"" said Joel
Toujas-Bernate, the head of the IMF mission to Algeria.
 ""If there is the perception that the country's oil wealth is
not benefiting all segments of the population, this could strain
things further,"" he said.
 Tunisia's unrest was triggered by a young unemployed man
setting fire to himself in protest at living conditions and his
treatment by the authorities.
 In Algeria, seven people have since set fire to themselves,
local media reported, in apparent copycat protests that have
also been repeated in other countries in the region.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 10:12AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Merkel and Barroso fail to settle EFSF differences," * Chancellor and Barroso disagree on fund
 * German says EFSF bond shows no need for action

(Adds more quotes, details, background)
 BERLIN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
and European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso failed to
resolve differences on boosting the EU's bailout fund in a
""lively discussion"" over dinner on Tuesday, her spokesman said.
 Barroso infuriated Berlin earlier this month when he called
publicly for the fund, known as the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF), to be increased.
 He dined with Merkel at a government estate north of Berlin
on Tuesday to discuss strategy for stemming the bloc's sovereign
debt crisis and her spokesman Steffen Seibert said the two had
touched on the EFSF.
 ""There were perhaps differences of opinion about whether it
is necessary to talk about it now,"" he said. Seibert described
their discussion on the issue as ""lively"" but rejected
suggestions there was a full-blown dispute.
 Barroso had warned ahead of the dinner that the currency
bloc needed to avoid ""procrastination"", which was seen as a dig
at Berlin and its outspoken rejection of his proposals.
 He wants the fund, which was set up last May after the
bloc's bailout of Greece and has already been tapped by Ireland,
to be beefed up to provide stronger defences for the euro.
 But Merkel and her Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble rule
out increasing the headline sum of 440 billion euros, wary in a
year with seven regional elections in Germany of alienating
taxpayers who are fed up with funding bailouts for overspending
euro zone partners.
 They are focusing instead on finding ways to maximise the
full capacity of the EFSF, whose effective lending clout is
really only about 250 billion euros because of the guarantee
system required to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 Seibert signalled that Germany was ready to compromise on
the fund as part of a broader anti-crisis package due to be
unveiled at a March 24-25 EU summit. Berlin has made clear that
it will make concessions only if its euro partners agree to
adopt German-style fiscal rules limiting debt.
 ""In the context of a broader strategy ... we have always
made clear that we will do what is necessary to adapt the
capacity of the rescue mechanism to requirements, but we will
decide based on the needs and there is no need for an increase
at the moment,"" Seibert said.
 Seibert said the EFSF's first bond sale on Tuesday, which
was roughly nine times oversubscribed, showed investors were
becoming more confident in the euro zone's strategy.
 ""On this basis there is no reason to decide about (an
increase in) the rescue fund, only a small part of which has
been tapped and which is functioning well,"" he said.
 The EU's top economic official, Olli Rehn, was also in
Germany on Tuesday, attempting to persuade Merkel's junior
coalition allies, the Free Democrats (FDP), to soften their
opposition to increasing the fund.
 But FDP leader Guido Westerwelle, the foreign minister and
deputy chancellor suffering a slump in popularity, said after
meeting Rehn that he was still not convinced the euro zone
bailout fund should be expanded.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 10:08AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 2-German officials urge Greek debt restructuring," * German adviser, MEP urge Greek debt restructuring
 * Euro near two-month high against dollar
 * Irish lawmakers back finance bill, averting govt collapse
 * Germany sees no need to boost EFSF, cites calmer markets
 
 By Sarah Marsh and John O'Donnell
 BERLIN/BRUSSELS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - An adviser to the German
government and a member of the European Parliament called on
Wednesday for moves to reduce Greece's debt burden, in signs
that the idea is gaining ground despite the denials of euro zone
policymakers.
 As the bloc struggled to bridge differences over how to
tackle its debt crisis, a top European Central Bank official
urged wholesale reform of the region's rescue fund and Germany
played down the need for change.
 But Beatrice Weder di Mauro, a member of the group of German
economic advisers dubbed ""wise men"", warned European politicians
against complacency, arguing for a ""broad solution"" to the
crisis, including a possible restructuring of Greek debt.
 ""A negotiation with creditors about a lengthening of
maturities and more favourable conditions would help,"" Weder di
Mauro said.
 Her comments were echoed by Wolf Klinz, a member of
Germany's ruling Free Democrats (FDP) who chairs a
crisis-response committee in the European Parliament.
 ""Greece will not make it without a restructuring,"" he told
Reuters in Brussels. ""It must be done quickly -- over the next
12 months.""
 European governments, including those of Germany and Greece,
have repeatedly rejected the idea but many economists believe
the only way for Athens to emerge from under its mountain of
debt would be for holders of its bonds to accept partial or
later repayments.
 Prominent Brussels-based think tank Bruegel said earlier
this week that it viewed a Greek debt restructuring as
inevitable and that delaying a decision would only increase the
penalty, or haircut, for debt holders.
 Economists believe there is only a 15 percent chance of a
Greek debt restructuring in the first half of this year but they
put the odds of extending repayment terms on its bailout loans
at 45 percent, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
 
 CALMER MARKETS
 After a rocky start to the year, smooth debt auctions in
countries like Portugal, Spain and Italy, and promises of new
policy measures have halted the contagion that led some experts
to question last year whether the euro would survive.
 The euro edged up for a seventh straight day to reach a
two-month high against the dollar, with traders citing
expectations euro zone interest rates will rise faster than
those in the U.S. as a driving factor.
 Other indicators also suggest investors are more confident
about the bloc's prospects. Spanish stocks, for example, have
surged 15 percent over the past two weeks, outperforming
European shares which have risen more modestly.
 On Wednesday, Ireland's shaky government averted immediate
collapse by winning a vote in the lower house of parliament on
its 2011 budget plans and sending a signal about its commitment
to an 85 billion euro EU/IMF bailout.
 But big risks remain for the euro zone and the main
challenge will be to forge agreement on a new crisis strategy in
the run-up to a Mar. 24-25 summit where policymakers have
promised to unveil a ""comprehensive package"" of measures.
 In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, European
Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer backed an
increase in the EU's rescue fund, known as the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and giving it new powers to
buy bonds or extend credit lines to vulnerable euro members.
 But Germany played down the need for a boost in the fund,
saying stellar demand for the EFSF debut debt issue on Tuesday
and calmer bond markets precluded the need for urgent action.
 The facility was hailed as 440-billion euros strong when it
was first agreed in May, but its effective lending capacity is
around 250 billion euros.
 ""There are signs that investors are becoming more confident
about Europe's readiness to do what is necessary,"" said
Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert. ""On this
basis there is no reason to decide about (an increase in) the
rescue fund.""
 
 ""AHEAD OF THE CURVE""
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet warned, however, in an
interview with Reuters Insider television at the World Economic
Forum in Davos that it was important for governments to get
""ahead of the curve"".
 Leaders are also under pressure to restore confidence in
their banking sectors. They have pledged to conduct a new round
of stress tests -- or financial health checks -- on their banks
in the coming months, but divisions remain over how far the
tests should go in assessing liquidity risks.
 Fitch applauded on Wednesday steps by Spain to overhaul its
unlisted savings banks, whose financial condition has been a
source of concern for months.
 But the credit rating agency also questioned whether the
steps would ultimately restore market confidence in Spain's
financial sector, questioning the long timeframe the banks have
been given to raise their capital levels and a lack of
incentives for the private sector to inject funds.

 * Dollar at 2-mth vs euro, 10-wk low on index as FOMC meets
 * World stocks push higher; helped by Obama speech and Fed
* US/Euro 3-mth futures show euro premium over 1 percent pt
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - World stocks rose and the dollar
hit a two-month low against the euro on Wednesday after a
promise of spending cuts from U.S. President Barack Obama
cemented expectations the Fed will retain faith in its
ultra-loose policy.
 Obama's annual State of the Union speech late on Tuesday
also signalled corporate tax cuts, a day before the U.S. central
bank's latest policy decision, due at 1915 GMT.
 Signs of Washington getting some grip on its bloated budget
deficits, even at the margin, will reinforce speculation of no
change to the monetary policy stance this year.
 By helping keep the Fed interest rate horizon and long-term
U.S. interest rates low, tighter fiscal policy tends to weaken
the dollar -- especially against a euro buoyed by the European
Central Bank's increasing hawkishness on inflation.
 Betting on easy U.S. money persisting and the prospect of
balancing those budget cuts with corporate tax breaks added a
fillip to U.S. and global equity prices.
 ""Obama's comments seems to have lifted sentiment and helped
calm some nerves. It was a very bullish speech and we can expect
to see more of the same from the Fed,"" said David Jones, chief
market strategist at IG Index. 
 Some economists said that an outcome that avoided either
overkill on austerity or a fresh spending spree was probably the
best for the market and, taken in isolation, the Fed outlook
should prove positive.
 ""The stock market should be fine with the spending freeze,""
said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New
York. ""People don't want additional stimulus here. This will
allow investors to focus on the Fed.""
 Most analysts saw the Fed keeping policy loose.
 ""We expect the Fed to maintain its commitment to asset
purchases up to the end of the second quarter and keep its
""extended period"" language despite a more upbeat view of the
U.S. economy,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, RIA Capital rate
strategist.
 TRANSATLANTIC CONTRAST
 Ten-year Treasury bond yields lost more than five basis
points on Tuesday but recouped some of that since Wednesday.
 Interest rate futures markets, however, showed the 3-month
yield premium expected on euro deposits over dollars at the end
of 2011 rising above one percentage point to a new cycle high.
 The dollar fell to a 10-week low against a basket of world
currencies and to a two-month low of $1.3723 to the euro.
 Equity markets were buoyant. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300
jumped 1.0 percent, and world stocks measured by MSCI
All-Country World Index climbed 0.42 percent.
 U.S. stock index futures were up about 0.4 percent,
indicating a stronger opening on Wall Street after a flat
session on Tuesday.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.5 percent, giving
back some of the previous day's 1 percent rally. But other Asian
markets ticked up slightly and MSCI's index of Asian stocks
outside Japan rose 0.1 percent.
 Emerging Asian markets rose powerfully in 2010, but since
then some investors have taken profits, and some pulled money
out of economies they fear are the most vulnerable to the
harmful effects of inflation, a growing global concern.
 ""Worries over monetary tightening will persist in the long
term, weighing especially on shares of producers dependent on
raw materials as their prices are still near all-time highs,""
said Masayuki Otani, chief analyst at Securities Japan Inc.
 In Europe, energy stocks featured among the best performers,
with the STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas index up 1.2 percent. BG
Group gained 3.1 percent after a new discovery confirmed light
oil in the Carioca area, offshore Brazil.
 Crude oil futures were up 0.8 percent in early trade.
 European shares were also helped by strength in carmakers on
merger and acquisition hopes. The STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles &
Parts index rose 2 percent.
 Porsche climbed 4.4 percent after a senior family member
said its merger with Volkswagen was on the right track.

 * Foreigners hold around $10 bln in Egyptian treasury bills
 * Government seen having scope to borrow domestically

 By Patrick Werr 
 CAIRO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nervous investors may begin
liquidating some of their substantial positions in Egyptian
equities and securities if the unprecedented political protests
that thrashed the market on Wednesday gain momentum.
 Demonstrators inspired by the revolt that brought down
Tunisia's president gathered on Tuesday for a ""Day of Wrath"" of
anti-government protests across the country in which three
protesters and one policeman were killed.
 Egypt said on Wednesday it was banning demonstrations and
quickly dispersed protesters who tried to regroup.
[ID:nLDE70P1G8] 
 ""People are talking about liquidating positions,"" said Raza
Agha, an economist with the Royal Bank of Scotland. ""They're
getting unnerved. I think the crucial test is today and tomorrow
if these things persist, and obviously how the government
responds.""
 ""If it responds too aggressively, in a fashion similar to
Tunisia, then it's likely it will become a broader thing and
people will seek to exit very quickly,"" Agha said.
 Egypt's benchmark stock index <.EGX30> tumbled 6.1 percent
percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 30,
2009, while the Egyptian pound weakened to 5.8300 to the dollar,
its lowest since January 2005.
 Foreign treasury bills holdings soared over the last year as
investors took advantage of a flood of cheap dollars to buy
Egyptian government paper, with T-bills yields of around 9 or 10
percent.
 As of November, foreigners held 61.3 billion Egyptian pounds
($10.54 billion) in treasury bills, up from 13.5 billion pounds
a year earlier, according to central bank statistics.
 A London-based currency dealer said that if traders and
portfolio managers were forced to cut positions the pound could
come under even greater pressure as they moved their funds out
of Egypt.
 ""It's looking a bit grey at the moment,"" said the London
currency dealer, who asked not to be named. ""It's getting a bit
out of hand and foreign traders are getting very stressed.""
 He said that there had been no offers for dollars in the
Egyptian pound non-deliverable forwards (NDF) market, nor had
there been offers for credit default swaps (CDS).
 The cost of insuring Egyptian debt against default rose to a
fresh 18-month high on Wednesday on political concerns, with
Egypt's five-year CDSs rising 11 basis points to 345 bps,
according to Markit.
 The foreign purchases of Egyptian securities has helped the
government finance its large deficit without crowding private
borrowers out of the market. The deficit reached 8.1 percent of
gross domestic product in the year to the end of June.
Agha said if the government increased it borrowing to expand
subsidies, a key demand of protesters, it would have little
problem finding finance domestically, but that markets would
suffer nonetheless.
 ""Because the banking system is so large and liquid, it
wouldn't be a problem in terms of financing deficits. But it
would move prices and it would the move the pound and it would
move bonds prices and CDS levels significantly,"" he said.
""The outflow would happen over a period of time. It depends
on the liquidity that currenty exists in the Egyptian market and
how people can find a counterparty to extinguish their
positions,"" Agha added. ""People are watching the situation very
closely.""

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 09:47AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Indonesian tin output seen down; Bangka rains ease," * Bangka region sees less rain; tin prices at record high
 * Indonesia needs investment in expensive dredgers
 * Indonesian tin output seen 10 percent lower in 2011

 (Updates tin price in 3rd paragraph)
 By Michael Taylor
 JAKARTA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Heavy rains are easing in
Indonesia's main tin producing area of Bangka island, although
exports in January are still expected to be as much as 35
percent lower than last month, industry sources said on
Wednesday.
 Analysts see little respite, with a lack of investment in
Indonesia's tin industry expected to push already soaring prices
to fresh records in 2011, as demand rises for the metal, used in
electronics, plating and lead-free solders.
 Benchmark tin on the London Metal Exchange hit a record high
at $28,698 a tonne on Wednesday, as persistent worries about
supplies from Indonesia boosted prices. It was $28,500 at 1445
GMT.
 Heavy rains and floods caused by the La Nina weather
phenomenon have hit tin miners in Indonesia in recent months,
squeezing supply from the world's top exporter of the metal.
 Indonesia's tin exports in January are seen at a maximum of
5,000 tonnes compared with 7,722 tonnes in December, the
Indonesian Tin Industry Association said.
 ""Exports would be around 5,000 tonnes maximum in January,""
said Rudi Irawan, vice chairman at the association and director
at independent smelter CV Stania Prima. ""Rains have eased but we
still have high waves because of the monsoon.""
 He added, ""We have depleting onshore reserves and high waves
offshore. There are only several smelters now fully-operational,
mostly because either they have strong financing or have its own
mines.""
 DRY SEASON TO START
 Indonesia's weather agency forecast this month that the dry
season is likely to start in most areas only in July.
 The heavy rains now appear to be easing.
 ""We have changed our mining plan so weather is not an issue
any more,"" said Darmansyah, a spokesman at PT Koba Tin in Bangka
island. ""Tin shipments have been smooth.""
 Bangka island, off Sumatra's east coast, is the world's
largest tin-producing area.
 He added that Koba Tin's production would be higher this
year than the figure of around 5,000 tonnes last year, but gave
no details.
 ""There is clearly an issue with supply going forward,"" said
a Singapore-based analyst. ""It is a bit tighter now because of
the weather -- it has been raining since November.
 ""Normally when this clears up, which should be next month,
you will see more material coming out of Indonesia.""
 INVESTMENT NEEDED
 Production in Indonesia has also been hit by a police
crackdown on illegal mining, stricter environmental and export
rules, and the depletion of easily mined onshore reserves.
 Indonesia, the world's second-largest producer after China,
has also struggled to lure foreign investment into mining,
compounded by some politicians taking a nationalist line on
resource exploitation and also because of uncertainty over
regulations tied to a new mining law passed in 2008.
 ""Large investments are needed for Indonesia to sustain the
production that they've had over the last couple of years,"" the
analyst said. ""A lot more has to come from off-shore -- this is
more expensive. You are looking at dredgers that go a lot
deeper.
 ""If you look at the amount of investment needed, and the
intrinsic value of the metal, then it will be a bit too risky
for the Rio Tintos of this world.""
 Indonesia supplies nearly 30 percent of the world's tin
consumption, and most of it comes from Bangka.
 Tin production in Southeast Asia's largest economy is
estimated to be around 105,000 tonnes in 2010.
 From Indonesia the metal is shipped to Malaysia via
Singapore, where it is given London Metal Exchange branding, and
then sold on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market or directly to
consumers in Europe. It is also exported to Thailand.
 ""You are going to see production fall to the tune of 10
percent, even though higher prices will incentivize people to be
a bit more risky with mining,"" said the analyst, adding that he
sees tin prices peaking at $35,000 a tonne in 2011.
 Soaring demand will help send tin almost 38 percent higher
this year, a Reuters poll showed this week.
 The survey of 51 analysts showed the cash tin price would
average $27,000 a tonne this year, and rise to $27,419 next
year.
 LME tin is expected to rise to $34,455 per tonne over the
next four weeks, going by its wave pattern and a Fibonacci
projection analysis, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.
 An annual survey by tin consultants ITRI this week said 2009
world usage of refined tin was estimated just over 320,000
tonnes, with 2010 global tin consumption rising by 12.5 percent
to an estimated 360,300 tonnes.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 09:28AM ET</span>","DAVOS-Doha trade talks gather momentum, not yet enough -Lamy"," * Negotiators willing to give more if get more back
 * Doha talks must speed up to reach 2011 target
 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Negotiations for a
new global trade deal have shifted up a gear but must accelerate
sharply if the long-running Doha round is to conclude this year,
the head of the World Trade Organization said on Wednesday.
 Negotiators said a new and realistic mood had taken hold in
the nine-year-old talks, and progress was being made in some
areas, but considerable gaps remained.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy told a meeting of key
ambassadors to review progress on the talks that they were now
reaching the point where the political signals from the G20 and
other leaders were at last translating into increased activity.
 But this was still not enough to say that the deal could be
done this year, as urged by the G20 and other leaders, he said,
according to a participant in the meeting at the WTO in Geneva.
 Michael Punke, U.S. ambassador to the WTO, said useful work
had been done in the last few weeks in groups covering different
aspects of the wide-ranging negotiations, such as agriculture
and industrial goods, but the start this year had been slower
than hoped.
 ""We're worried because we don't have much time left,"" he
told reporters after the meeting. ""They aren't tackling right
now the biggest road blocks.""
 Mexican ambassador Fernando de Mateo said the negotiations
had made progress weeks in areas such as non-tariff barriers and
the technical process for translating a deal into new tariffs
and subsidies in agriculture. 
 
 MINISTERIAL INPUT NEEDED
 Economists say a successful deal could boost the world
economy by hundreds of billions of dollars once it is phased in
over several years, help business sentiment and reinforce
defences against protectionism.
 But some negotiators wonder whether 2011 will join a long
list of missed deadlines if trading powers are unwilling to find
the necessary compromises between opening markets and protecting
politically sensitive industries and farmers.
 Ambassadors at the meeting said they were already at the
limits of their negotiating mandates, but said they were
prepared to do more provided they could be sure other WTO
members would offer something in exchange.
 Negotiators hope trade ministers meeting on Friday and
Saturday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos
will give some guidance on how this process of give-and-take
should work.
 ""Ministers have to provide us with some inputs,"" Mateo said.
 That process of reciprocity would go far beyond the
traditional picture of rich trading powers like the United
States and European Union calling for the emerging economies to
open their markets further.
 Many poorer developing countries are loathe to reopen what
has been agreed so far for fear of losing what is on the table. 
 Some emerging countries like Argentina and South Africa are
unhappy with the current state of the negotiating texts which
they feel are tilted unfairly against them and do not provide
the flexibility they need to protect fledgling industries.
 Others like Costa Rica, Chile and Colombia see great
potential in expanding South-South trade and want to increase
export opportunities in emerging countries too.
 But the fate of the talks is likely to be determined by
whether the United States can reach agreement with the big
emerging economies of China, India and Brazil.
 ""We've found China to be constructive,"" Punke said, noting
that discussions between President Barack Obama and Chinese
President Hu Jintao on Doha at last week's U.S-China summit were
a hopeful sign.
 Punke told the meeting of ambassadors not to read too much
into Obama's failure to mention Doha by name in Tuesday's State
of the Union message. He had mentioned ""global trade talks"" in
the speech - intended for a broad domestic audience - and would
address trade questions more closely when he visits the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce on Feb. 7.

previous LONDON)
 NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell from a two-month
high against the dollar on Wednesday to trade little changed as
investors adjusted positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's
comments from its policy meeting later in the day.
 None are expecting the U.S. central bank to announce any
change in the benchmark interest rate, but investors are
looking for confirmation from the Fed that its focus remains on
supporting growth.
 The belief that the Fed will stick to a much easier policy
than the European Central Bank, which is growing worried about
inflation, has helped the euro to extend its recovery after a
two-month drubbing on worries over euro-zone debt.
 But analysts said market players may be wary of selling the
dollar too much ahead of the Fed announcement, with
policymakers likely to acknowledge a recent improvement in the
U.S. economy.
 ""The Fed is expected to keep policy on hold today, leaving
the tone of the statement the major risk,"" said Sacha Tihanyi,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
""Acknowledging an improved inflation situation may provide U.S.
dollar support.""
 The euro  rose to $1.3723 on trading platform EBS,
its highest since November 22, before dipping back to $1.3675,
little changed from the prior close.
 Traders said a large option barrier was taken out at
$1.3720, with more barriers highlighted at $1.3725 and $1.3750.
Stop-losses were reportedly lurking above the latter level.
 The euro stalled ahead of a key technical level around
$1.3740, the 61.8 percent retracement of its fall from November
to January. Beyond that, its Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 is seen as
a major target.
 ""Most of this euro rally seems to be driven by speculators
with no major structural inflows coming into the euro zone,""
said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 FED FOCUS
 Analysts expect the U.S. central bank will keep short-term
rates near zero and say it remains committed to its $600
billion bond purchase programme in its policy announcement
later today. [ID:nN25283937]
 ""The Fed seems to have welded monetary policy to the U.S.
unemployment rate which is still very high. Until there is some
moderation down to around 8 percent in the jobless rate it's
hard to think there could be any change in policy,"" said
Kathleen Brookes, Research Director at FOREX.com.
 The dollar was under pressure after U.S. bond yields fell
on news of President Barack Obama's proposal to freeze portions
of federal spending in his State of the Union address on
Tuesday.
 The FOMC's policy outlook contrasts with that of the ECB.
President Jean-Claude Trichet has warned about rising inflation
in the region, sparking talk of a rate hike later this year and
helping to widen the euro's rate advantage over the dollar.
 The euro also continued to benefit from strong demand for
inaugural bonds from Europe's financial rescue fund on Tuesday.
Asian investors, including the Japanese government, took up
more than one-third of the 5 billion euro offer.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
versus the dollar on Wednesday on perceptions that interest
rates will rise sooner in the euro zone than in the U.S., taking
out option barriers on the way and approaching key resistance.
 The dollar hit a 10-week low against a basket of currencies
with the market looking for confirmation from the Federal
Reserve later in the day that its focus remains on supporting
growth.
 The belief that the Fed will stick to a much easier policy
than the European Central Bank, which is growing worried about
inflation, has helped the euro to extend its recovery after a
two-month drubbing on worries over euro-zone debt.
 But the euro's rally was still on shaky ground, while
analysts said market players may be wary of selling the dollar
too much ahead of the Fed announcement, with policymakers likely
to acknowledge a recent improvement in the U.S. economy.
 ""It will be interesting to see the reaction of the Fed to a
general improvement in economic data, which could prove a
rationale to stem dollar-selling,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency
strategist at CIBC.
 ""People may prove reluctant to be too short of dollars
before the Fed statement in case of a general hardening of the
tone"".
 The euro  rose to $1.3723 on trading platform EBS, its
highest since November 22, before dipping back to $1.3693.
 Traders said a large option barrier was taken out at
$1.3720, with more barriers highlighted at $1.3725 and $1.3750.
Stop-losses were reportedly lurking above the latter level.
 The euro stalled ahead of a key technical level around
$1.3740, the 61.8 percent retracement of its fall from November
to January. Beyond that, its Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 is seen as
a major target.
 ""Most of this euro rally seems to be driven by speculators
with no major structural inflows coming into the euro zone,""
said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich.
 
 FED FOCUS
 The dollar index was down 0.2 percent at 77.809 <.DXY>,
having hit a 10-week low of 77.748.
 Analysts expect the U.S. central bank will keep short-term
rates near zero and will say it remains committed to its $600

today. [ID:nN25283937]
 ""The Fed seems to have welded monetary policy to the U.S.
unemployment rate which is still very high. Until there is some
moderation down to around 8 percent in the jobless rate it's
hard to think there could be any change in policy,"" said
Kathleen Brookes, Research Director at FOREX.com. 
 The dollar was under pressure after U.S. bond yields fell on
news of President Barack Obama's proposal to freeze portions of
federal spending in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.
 The FOMC's policy outlook contrasts with that of the ECB.
Governor Jean-Claude Trichet has warned about rising inflation
in the region, sparking talk of a rate hike later this year and
helping to widen the euro's rate advantage over the dollar.
 The euro also continued to benefit from strong demand for
inaugural bonds from Europe's financial rescue fund on Tuesday.

 * Inflation rise temporary
 * Stress tests need to be tougher, but not too much
 
 (Adds quotes, background, comments on inflation)
 BRATISLAVA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Stronger fiscal coordination
among euro zone countries will form a sufficient basis for the
survival of the single currency, European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jozef Makuch said on Wednesday.
 Speaking at an economic seminar, Makuch echoed comments by
fellow central bankers that inflation in the euro area could
rise further above the bank's 2 percent target in the first half
but fall back after that.
 European governments have been discussing ways to strengthen
the euro zone's fiscal framework to avoid profligacy among
member states which led to Europe's debt crisis.
 Makuch said he was optimistic about the euro's future
because the crisis was a fiscal one and it was being addressed.
 ""The optimism that the euro will survive is optimism
stemming from (the fact that) large fiscal projects are being
implemented not only in those countries directly threatened but
also in others,"" Makuch told an economic conference in
Bratislava.
 ""There is an assumption that the fiscal leg, although not
full-fledged ... is strengthening, and it will be sufficient to
hold up the euro together with the monetary leg.""
 European leaders have been discussing a number of measures
to boost fiscal discipline in the euro zone and at the same time
boost the capacity of the main debt crisis-relief tool, the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 No specific decisions have yet been taken -- and may not be
until EU leaders meet to discuss next steps at a summit on March
24-25 -- but trial balloons and proposals are being released
that suggest some of the tactics under consideration. 
 Echoing other ECB policymakers, Makuch said an inflation
rise above the ECB's target of below but close to 2 percent was
a temporary problem.
""It (inflation rise) has so far been viewed as a temporary
issue, it can go a little higher in the first half but then it
should get toward the ECB's long-term target,"" he said.
 Makuch said the euro zone's next round of banking stress
tests must be based on stricter criteria than last year's tests
which failed to reveal risks in banks' balance sheets, but at
the same time an overly strict approach would also be wrong.
 Another ECB Governing Council member Marko Kranjec, who
heads Slovenia's central bank, said on Wednesday the next round
of EU bank stress tests would be conducted in February and the
criteria for banks would be much tougher than tests carried out
last year.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 06:04AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-U.N. food body FAO warns against food export curbs," * Export restrictions disrupt world markets - FAO
 * Food prices hit record in December, grains rally in Jan
 * Poor countries need investment for sustainable farm growth
 
 (Adds details) 
 MILAN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The United Nations' food agency
warned food producing countries on Wednesday against introducing
export curbs to protect local markets as world food prices rose
close to levels that triggered food riots in 2007/2008.
 Global food prices rose above 2008 highs in December with
the Food Price Index of the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) at record highs.. 
 Wheat and other grains rallied in January on concerns about
tight supplies, with Euronext milling wheat futures hitting new
contract highs on Wednesday.
 ""FAO strongly advises against such measures, as they often
provoke more uncertainty and disruption on world markets and
drive prices up further globally, while depressing prices
domestically and hence curtailing incentives to produce more
food,"" Richard China, director of the FAO Policy and Programme
Development Support Division, said in a statement.
 Grain prices surged in 2010 as wheat was driven higher by a
series of weather events including drought in Russia, which
introduced an export ban. In 2008, several countries curbed
exports.
 New price shocks have raised serious concerns about
implications for food markets in vulnerable countries, the FAO
said in the statement, as it published updated guidelines on how
to deal with high food prices in developing countries.
 This month has seen civil unrest in several countries
including Algeria, Jordan and Sudan, due at least in part to
high food prices.
 The agency has called upon countries not to take any policy
actions that might appear useful in the short term but could
undermine existing markets and have harmful longer-term effects
or even aggravate the situation.
 ""In cases where markets are malfunctioning or absent, it may
be necessary to take extreme measures that shortcut market
mechanisms. In this situation, interventions could also be used
to help private sector operators emerge,"" the agency said.
 In the medium and longer term, only investment in developing
countries' agriculture would ensure sustainable productivity
growth, healthy markets, increased resilience to international
price spikes and improved food security, FAO's China said.

 * Indonesia may buy more
 * Prices supported for now, set to ease with Vietnam harvest
(Adds comments from Bulog source and Philippine official)	
 By Apornrath Phoonphongphiphat and Ho Binh Minh	
 BANGKOK/HANOI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Indonesia's bumper
purchase of 820,000 tonnes of Thai rice, nearly five times the
volume sought, lifted the market on Wednesday but traders were
unconvinced prices would stay high, thanks to Vietnam's rising
supply and lower imports projected from the Philippines.	
 The amount Indonesia's state buying agency Bulog bought from
Thai exporters for prompt shipment far surpassed the 170,000
tonnes of 15 percent broken Thai rice announced earlier for the
batch, a source with Bulog and traders said.	
 ""The deal surprised the market as it was bigger than
expected and it has automatically pushed domestic milled rice
higher,"" one exporter said.	
 Firmer prices of the main staple in Asia are of concern to
policy makers anxious to avoid a repeat of the riots triggered
by price spikes in 2008.	
 ""There are 650,000 tonnes of 15 percent broken grade and
170,000 tonnes of 5 percent broken grade white rice,"" said one
exporter who has contracted to sell rice to Bulog.	
 The two grades of rice, for shipment in February and March,
were sold at prices ranging between $490 and $545 per tonne on
a cost, insurance and freight basis (CIF), exporters who were
awarded deals said.	
 Thai 5 percent broken-grade white rice rose to 14,600 baht
($472) per tonne from last week's 14,200 baht, traders said.	
 The export price for 5 percent broken-grade rose to $525 per
tonne from last week $520, free on board (FOB), they said.	
 It was not immediately clear whether the 820,000 tonnes
bought were part of the permit to import 1.5 million tonnes of
rice for shipments until end-February.	
 ""We received an overall offer of 900,000 tonnes,"" said the
Bulog source.	
 Indonesia has secured a total of 1.33 million tonnes from
Thailand and Vietnam for delivery until next month, Trade
Minister Mari Pangestu said at the end of December.	
 
 PRICES FIRM FOR NOW	
 Indonesian demand helped support overall Thai rice prices.
The benchmark 100 percent B grade white rice  was
being offered at $540 per tonne on Wednesday, up from last
week's $535 per tonne, traders said.	
 Traders said they expected Bulog to buy more rice again when
prices eased, as Vietnam is about to harvest its major crop,
which could drag prices down.	
 ""Demand in Indonesia must be strong, as they did not wait
for prices to soften in Vietnam when the current harvest peaks,
to buy rice,"" said a trader in Ho Chi Minh City.	
 A trader in Jakarta said Bulog had been in protracted talks
with Thai and Vietnamese exporters over Indonesian import
requirements to fulfill its permit requirements.	
 The government, which allowed Bulog to ship in rice last
year because of falling stockpiles, has imposed tight rice trade
rules since 2004 that bar imports of the politically sensitive
food grain during the main February-June harvest to avert
pressure on farmers' prices. 
 The government normally waits for the main harvest to end
in June to assess stock levels, the progress of Bulog's rice
procurement, local rice prices, farmgate prices, and official
production figures before deciding in September whether to
import for the following year.	
 Rice prices in Vietnam, which raised the minimum price of
its export-grade rice this month ahead of negotiations with the
Philippines, eased this week before a long holiday on a lack of
buying interest, especially after Indonesia moved to secure the
hefty volume from Thailand, traders said. 
 ""Exporters did not expect the volume to turn out to be that
high,"" another trader in Ho Chi Minh City said.	
 Indicative offers for Vietnam's 5 percent broken rice eased
to between $460 and $470 a tonne, free on board, against $470
last week, while the Vietnam Food Association retains an export
price floor for the grade at $520 . 
 The 25 percent broken-rice grade softened to $430-$440 a
tonne against $435 last week and far below the floor of $498 per
tonne. 
 Officials of the Vietnam Food Association, which leads the
strategy on raising prices, could not be reached for comment.	
 ""This purchase will make people in the association rethink
their pricing,"" a Vietnamese trader at a foreign firm in Ho Chi
Minh City said, adding that Vietnam might have to lower the
export floor prices.	
 ""The floor is designed for the (potential) deal with the
Philippines.""	
 He said Vietnam focused too much on selling to the
Philippines but Manila had been quiet on its demand, while Bulog
went ahead to buy Thai rice, making the situation more difficult
for Vietnamese rice industry officials to react.	
 But prospects of lower production loom, as Vietnam's Mekong
Delta rice basket is projected to yield 21.5 million tonnes of
paddy, or unmilled rice, in 2011, the Communist Party-run Nhan
Dan newspaper reported on Wednesday.	
 The delta has been losing rice fields to rapid urbanisation
in recent years. The regional government had planned to export
5.5 million tonnes of milled rice this year, down slightly from
5.6 million shipped in 2010.	
 Philippine Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala said the
National Food Authority (NFA) council, the panel that approves
buying plans for the world's top rice importer, may firm up the
2011 import volume in two to three weeks. The government
recently estimated purchases may be around a third to half of
last year's volumes, or 800,000 to 1.2 million tonnes.	
 ""We are not in a hurry to buy. As of last week, we have 47
days of stocks at NFA,"" said Alcala. The NFA is required to
maintain a 30-day buffer stock during lean months from July to
September.	
 ""We can assure that (domestic) rice prices will remain
stable. Also, based on our field monitoring, the standing crops
are all in good condition.""

(Adds analysis, criticism by ECB)
 By Fiona Shaikh and David Milliken
 LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King faces growing opposition in his Monetary Policy Committee
as inflation boosts pressure for an early interest rate hike,
minutes of the committee's last meeting suggested on Wednesday.
 Martin Weale, who had been viewed as a moderate,
unexpectedly joined longstanding hawk Andrew Sentance on the
nine-member committee by calling for an immediate 0.25
percentage point rise in interest rates, minutes of the Jan.
12-13 meeting revealed.
 ""The cracks are starting to appear in the MPC consensus,""
said Brian Hilliard, economist at Societe Generale. ""Not only
did Weale vote for a rate increase, there's a hint that other
members were teetering on the brink of doing that as well.""
 The pound rose and short sterling interest rate futures
tumbled on the news, which came a day after shock data showed
Britain's economy contracted in the last three months of 2010.
 Market expectations for future interest rates have swung
wildly over the past two days. Investors now see a first hike in
August as the most likely outcome; before Tuesday's gross
domestic product data, the markets had generally expected a hike
in May. [ID:nLDE70O19B]
 
 KING'S DEFENCE
 In a rare public speech on Tuesday, King mounted a
determined defence of the BoE's decision not to lift interest
rates over the past year, arguing that inflation would fall back
in 2012 as its recent surge was due to one-off pressures from
import prices, oil and rises in indirect taxes.
 He insisted that while the central bank would have to raise
interest rates at some point, the move would not be based on
headline inflation numbers; money supply and consumption would
have to be growing too.
 ""A return to economic stability from our fragile condition
will require careful and well-judged steps looking beyond the
next few months,"" King said in his speech. [ID:nSLAPCE7NL]
 But after inflation hit an eight-month high of 3.7 percent
in December, having stood at least a percentage point above the
BoE's 2 percent target throughout 2010, Tuesday's minutes showed
increasing sympathy for the idea of early monetary tightening.
 A small interest rate rise now might have little effect on
economic growth but protect the BoE's inflation-fighting
credibility, thereby averting a larger, more damaging rise in
bond yields down the road.
 The minutes said the MPC's 7-2 decision to leave rates
unchanged at their record low of 0.5 percent in January was
""finely balanced"" for some MPC members, and that the February
Inflation Report would help them assess the outlook for prices.
 Policymakers had early access to December inflation data at
their January meeting and the minutes said inflation was likely
to be ""materially higher"" in the short term than the MPC had
thought in November. In his speech on Tuesday, King said it
could rise near 5 percent in coming months.
 Also, the minutes showed MPC members saw longer-term
challenges from rising commodity prices and import costs, and
most thought medium-term inflation risks had shifted upwards.
 King's reluctance to raise interest rates any time soon is
also being questioned by some officials in other central banks.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet warned
at the weekend of the dangers of ignoring the inflationary
threat of rising commodity prices, and said policymakers should
not focus on ""core inflation"" data excluding those prices.
 Some analysts believe Trichet, concerned by the risk of a
global surge in inflation, wanted to send a message to other
central banks such as the BoE. [ID:nLDE70O0AI]
 
 SIGNAL
 In the event, the MPC decided in January to keep interest
rates at 0.5 percent, where they have stood since March 2009,
because of unused capacity in the economy, fiscal austerity, the
euro zone debt crisis and tight credit conditions in Britain.
 ""Some members also noted that an increase in Bank Rate...
might be misinterpreted as a signal that the Committee would
attempt to bring inflation back to target excessively rapidly,
which could cause expectations of a relatively sharp tightening
of monetary policy that could have a detrimental impact,"" the
minutes read.
 The scale of Britain's economic decline at the end of 2010
is likely to complicate the MPC's dilemma further. Analysts had
expected the economy to grow roughly in line with its long-term
trend rate in late 2010 and early 2011, despite snow in December
and a rise in value-added tax in January, but Tuesday's data
showed a shock 0.5 percent contraction in the fourth quarter.
 ""Though the minutes place significant importance on next
month's Inflation Report, yesterday's data makes it very
unlikely that those in the middle ground will be able to resolve
their dilemma one way or the other by the next meeting,"" said
Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club.
 Even MPC member Adam Posen, who repeated his call for a 50
billion pound expansion of the central bank's quantitative
easing programme, seemed to be preparing to ditch that view in
the latest minutes. He noted that a sustained rise in commodity
prices or weaker sterling could outweigh downward pressure on
domestic prices.
 ""As things stand, the risks to our November forecast appear
skewed towards a sooner rate hike,"" said Simon Hayes, economist
at Barclays Capital.

 * But threat remains, exacerbated by currency rows
* Trade ministers to meet twice in Davos

 By Jonathan Lynn
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Of the raft of global
risks confronting business and political bigwigs at Davos, the
threat of a trade war is one of the scariest.
 Open markets and trade are the essence of the globalisation
that delivered rising prosperity for decades until interrupted
by the credit crunch and economic downturn.
 An initial unified global response to the crisis staved off
the wave of protectionism that many felt was inevitable.
But fears persist that stubborn trade disputes -- especially
between China and rich powers like the United States, European
Union and Japan -- could spill over into an outright trade war,
not least because of tensions over exchange rates.
 Trade ministers will hold two meetings at Davos this week to
review progress on the renewed push for a deal on the Doha trade
round this year.
 A failure to conclude the round, already more than nine
years old, would deal a body blow to the global trading system.
 Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega, watching the
appreciation of the real, said last September the country was in
a currency war, and earlier this month warned that conflict was
turning into a trade war.
 ""The threat of a trade war is real,"" Jean-Pierre Lehmann, a
professor at the IMD business school in Lausanne and founder of
The Evian Group trade and economy think-tank, told Reuters.
 ""We know that trade wars make everybody pay the
consequences, but that doesn't prevent them from happening.""
 
 DISPUTE SETTLEMENT
 The failure of 1930s-style protectionism to emerge in the
downturn was widely ascribed to the multilateral trading system
umpired by the World Trade Organization (a system set up in
response to the economic tensions of the interwar period).
 The WTO dispute system provides a respected channel for
states to resolve differences by consultation or litigation.
 Just recently the United States has proposed changes to a
controversial method of setting anti-dumping duties, known as
zeroing, to comply with WTO rulings.
 China, a frequent target of WTO litigation, also makes
active use of the system as a complainant.
 According to former WTO Deputy Director-General Roderick
Abbott, the recognition that supply chains nowadays are global
militates against protectionism.
 ""Interrupting the chain by shutting out your neighbour can
mean shutting down your main industry,"" he wrote recently.
 In his regular reports to WTO members and the G20, WTO
Director-General Pascal Lamy has argued that the rules-based
trading system has withstood the crisis. But late last year he
warned that currency tensions could undermine that resilience.
 The desire to hold down currencies has many causes, but
defending domestic jobs by keeping exports cheap and imports
dear often plays a role.
 While many economists and policymakers are upbeat about
overall economic prospects, few are bullish about the outlook
for employment. The International Labour Organization forecasts
another year of stubborn global unemployment over 200 million
acting as a brake on recovery.
 Lamy says a deal in the Doha round for a new trade agreement
would bolster the WTO system as a bulwark against protectionism.
 The converse, of course, is also true.
 Weary trade negotiators say it is still not clear, despite
ritual calls in G8 and G20 communiques, whether political
leaders are ready for the compromises needed for a deal.
 In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President
Barack Obama called for quick approval of a free-trade deal with
South Korea, but referred in passing to ""global trade talks""
only in the same breath as other pacts with Colombia and Panama
and talks on a regional Asia-Pacific deal.
 A preference for bilateral or regional deals over Doha can
be seen as another crack in the multilateral trading system.
 But for some, the importance of Doha goes beyond however
many billions of dollars it would inject into the world economy.
 The ability to clinch a new trade deal is a touchstone for
the world community's ability to cooperate on other issues, from
climate change and poverty to financial regulation.
 The World Economic Forum identifies weak global governance
as one of the main threats to the world today.
 The unified approach of the G20 in the early stages of the
crisis -- reminiscent of short-lived global unity after the 9/11
attacks -- has since fragmented.
 ""The world is probably less together than it was a year ago,
when there was still a halo effect of everyone plunging in to
deal with the immediate effects of the downturn,"" Mark Foster,
global head of management consulting at Accenture, told Reuters.

* US/Euro 3-mth futures show euro premium well over 1 pct pt
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - World stocks rose and the dollar
hit a two-month low against the euro on Tuesday after a promise
of spending cuts from U.S. President Barack Obama cemented
expectations the Fed will retain faith in its ultra-loose
policy.
 Obama's annual State of the Union speech late on Tuesday
also signalled corporate tax cuts, a day before the U.S. central
bank's latest policy decision, due at 1915 GMT.
 Signs of Washington getting some grip on its bloated budget
deficits, even at the margin, will reinforce speculation of no
change to the monetary policy stance this year.
 By helping keep the Fed interest rate horizon and long-term
U.S. interest rates low, tighter fiscal policy tends to weaken
the dollar -- especially against a euro buoyed by the European
Central Bank's increasing hawkishness on inflation.
 Betting on easy U.S. money persisting and the prospect of
balancing those budget cuts with corporate tax breaks added a
fillip to U.S. and global equity prices.
 ""Obama's comments seems to have lifted sentiment and helped
calm some nerves. It was a very bullish speech and we can expect
to see more of the same from the Fed,"" said David Jones, chief
market strategist at IG Index. 
 Some economists said that an outcome that avoided either
overkill on austerity or a fresh spending spree was probably the
best for the market and, taken in isolation, the Fed outlook
should prove positive.
 ""The stock market should be fine with the spending freeze,""
said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New
York. ""People don't want additional stimulus here. This will
allow investors to focus on the Fed.""
 Most analysts saw the Fed keeping policy loose.
 ""We expect the Fed to maintain its commitment to asset
purchases up to the end of the second quarter and keep its
""extended period"" language despite a more upbeat view of the
U.S. economy,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, RIA Capital rate
strategist.

 TRANSATLANTIC CONTRAST
 Ten-year Treasury bond yields  lost more than
five basis points on Tuesday but recouped some of that since
Wednesday.
 Interest rate futures markets, however, showed the 3-month
yield premium expected on euro deposits over dollars at the end
of 2011 rising above one percentage point to a new cycle high.
 The dollar fell to a 10-week low against a basket of world
currencies <.DXY> and to a two-month low of $1.3723 to the euro.
 Equity markets were buoyant. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> jumped 1.0 percent, and world stocks measured by MSCI
All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> climbed 0.42 percent.
 U.S. stock index futures    were up about
0.4 percent, indicating a stronger opening on Wall Street after
a flat session on Tuesday.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> fell 0.5 percent,
giving back some of the previous day's 1 percent rally. But
other Asian markets ticked up slightly and MSCI's index of Asian
stocks outside Japan <.MIAPJ00000PUS> rose 0.1 percent.
 Emerging Asian markets rose powerfully in 2010, but since
then some investors have taken profits, and some pulled money
out of economies they fear are the most vulnerable to the
harmful effects of inflation, a growing global concern.
 ""Worries over monetary tightening will persist in the long
term, weighing especially on shares of producers dependent on
raw materials as their prices are still near all-time highs,""
said Masayuki Otani, chief analyst at Securities Japan Inc.
 In Europe, energy stocks featured among the best performers,
with the STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas index <.SXEP> up 1.2
percent. BG Group gained 3.1 percent after a new discovery
confirmed light oil in the Carioca area, offshore Brazil.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 05:04AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-New Indonesia trade rule spurs delay to some thermal coal shipments," * Export document issue delays some shipments to India
 * Buyers of blended coal from small miners affected
(Adds details)	
 JAKARTA/LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A new Indonesian trade
rule has triggered delays on some thermal coal shipments,
particularly to Indian buyers, which could tighten supply from
the world's top thermal coal exporter, five trading sources said
on Wednesday.	
 The trade ministry ordered surveyors in January to
temporarily halt issuing surveyor reports to traders who are in
the process of reapplying for trading permits under a new coal
and mining law system. The surveyor reports are documents
required for shipping the fuel.	
 Traders could not confirm how many cargoes were being
delayed, but said vessels were being held up at ports.	
 ""There have been some dramas in Indonesia and some of the
shipowners are caught in the middle by the delays,"" said a
regional trader who buys coal from Indonesian small and medium
mines.	
 The delay so far has only affected thermal coal, used by
utilities, with the impact on shipments of coking coal not clear
yet, traders said.	
 Indonesia only produces a couple of million tonnes of coking
coal, or less than 1 percent of its total estimated 2010
production of 340 million tonnes.	
 ""Based on the new coal and mining law, every trader must
have permit on trading and transporting issued by the energy
ministry,"" said Alberth Yusuf Tobogu, director of exports of
industry and mining products.	
 ""To support that, our ministry has asked surveyors not to
issue reports for traders who don't have the permit,"" said
Tobogu.	
 But surveyors are still allowed to issue reports for exports
from coal producers, he said. These include Indonesia's top
producer Bumi Resources and Adaro Energy .	
 Indonesia has required exports of mining products including
coal and tin to be checked by surveyors before shipping them out
as the country seeks to keep illegal mining in check and boost
revenue from the sector.	
 Surveyor reports show the origin of the cargoes and are used
to calculate royalties, Tobogu said.	
 The rule appeared to affect traders who don't own mines and
buy blended coal, or aggregate coal from various small miners to
fulfill cargoes. It also affect traders who buy coal in barges.	
 Commodity trading giant Glencore, Mercuria and Flame SA
have so far not been affected by this, traders said.	
 ""In any case, we are not affected by this as we are
currently purchasing single mine coals,"" said a dealer in a
European trading firm that buys from Indonesia mines. 
 ""But it is indeed a big issue with blended cargoes and we
hear that other traders are affected,"" the dealer said without
giving details.	
 The delays come even as Indian traders and end users are
close to resuming thermal coal prompt buying after a break of
several months, some of India's largest traders said on Tuesday.

Coal prices have dropped to around $115.00 a tonne FOB South
Africa's Richards Bay from $130.00 in early January and this,
plus plumetting freight rates, has brought an acceptable
delivered cost within sight, they said. 
 However, the Indonesian trade rule may not significantly
impact thermal coal prices as it only causes delays, while coal
supply from Australia's flood-stricken Queensland is gradually
returning to normal.	
 Spot prices for Australian coal climbed above $140 per
tonne at the height of floods in Queensland but have dropped
sharply to under $125 per tonne on Tuesday, as exports continued
to recover from Queensland floods. 
 
 NOT ALL AFFECTED BY DELAYS 
 Some shipments to Indian buyers who seek Indonesian coal to
replace South African coal, had been seeing small delays
although major Indian coal importers who only buy from single
mine coals did not experience it.	
 ""There are some documentation delays from Indonesia with
certain traders' shipment. It's true. But they are delays of
just some days and it doesn't affect every trader, so it depends
on who you buy from,"" said an Indian trader who is buying a lot
of Indonesian coal.	
 While the new rule only apply to traders, it has prompted
some miners to be more cautious when exporting the coal,
potentially extending shipment delay to other buyers.	
 ""Some miners are refusing to issue invoices under their name
although they have the permit and allowed to export,"" said a
marketing director in a medium-sized Indonesian coal producer.	
 ""They fear tax issues,"" he said.	
 Indonesia is expected to produce 340 million tonnes of coal
this year with about 80 percent coming from medium-big size
miners while the rest is coming from small miners.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 04:39AM ET</span>","BoE-MPC considered Jan rate rise, 2 vote for hike"," LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker
Martin Weale unexpectedly joined Andrew Sentance in voting for a
quarter-point rate rise this month, minutes to the BoE's January
Monetary Policy Committee meeting showed on Wednesday.
 The minutes said the MPC explicitly considered the case for
a rate rise in January, and that for some members this was a
finely balanced decision.
 ""For most members, recent developments implied that the
risks to inflation in the medium term had probably shifted
upwards,"" the minutes said.
 However, the MPC deliberations took place before
policymakers knew that Britain's economy unexpectedly contracted
by 0.5 percent in the last three months of 2010.
 The MPC opted to keep rates on hold, citing downside risks
to inflation from spare capacity, fiscal austerity, a potential
jolt to exports from the euro zone crisis as well as tig ht
credit conditions.
 ""Some members also noted that an increase in Bank Rate ...
might be misinterpreted as a signal that the Committee would
attempt to bring inflation back to target excessively rapi dly,
which could cause expectations of a relatively sharp tightening
of monetary policy that could have a detrimental impact.""
 The MPC had access to an early estimate of December's 3.7
percent inflation reading but did not know about the scale of
the impact on growth from December's harsh weather.
 Their expectation was that the economy would grow roughly in
line with trend in late 2010 and early 2011, despite snow in
December and a rise in value added tax in January.
 Adam Posen repeated his call for a 50 billion pound
expansion of the central bank's quantitative easing programme,
though he noted that a sustained rise in commodity prices or
weaker sterling could outweigh downward domestic price
pressures.
 Other members of the MPC saw upside risks to inflation from
commodity prices, strong growth in emerging markets that could
push up the cost of imports and rising household i nflation
expectations.
 The publication of the minutes came after BoE Governor
Mervyn King said on Tuesday that he expected inflation to rise
towards 5 percent in the coming months, but that this alo ne was
not enough to justify an immediate rise in interest rates.
 He also said that the BoE could preserve its credibility if
it explained its decisions well, and that large relative price
shocks were an inevitable part of the economy's rebalancing.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2011 04:31AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-French chemical body sees 2011 output growth at 3 pct," * UIC sees 2010 French chemical production growth at 10
percent
 * Sees 2011 slowdown to some 3 percent, stocking back to
normal
 * Forecasts slight improvement from previous predictions
 
 By Caroline Jacobs
 PARIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - French chemical production growth
is seen slowing to about 3 percent this year from an estimated
10 percent in 2010 when the battered industry bounced back from
the effects of the global economic crisis.
 The slowdown comes as client stock levels return to normal
following a catch-up and European governments end aid to
industries that are key clients of the chemical sector, the
chairman of France's UIC chemical body said.
 The forecasts are still higher than those given in June,
when the UIC predicted growth of 2.6 percent this year and 9
percent in 2010.
 ""The rebound for the sector was very strong in the first six
to nine months of 2010 and since growth has been much more
moderate growth, which has remained at a good level,"" Olivier
Homolle told Reuters. ""This trend will continue in 2011.""
 The recession pushed French chemical output 9.7 percent
lower in 2009 from 2008 levels. It was the steepest drop in 20
years for a sector which provides a range of industries with
materials, such as for ski shoes, solar panels, cars, creams,
packaging, food and paint.
 Homolle expects chemical sector production in France this
year to fare a bit better than in Europe, estimating growth at
about 3 percent compared with the 2.5 percent forecast the CEFIC
European chemical body has given so far for the region.
 The UIC will in March publish final figures for 2010 and
prospects for the French chemical industry, the second-biggest
in Europe after Germany and fifth worldwide with sales of nearly
68 billion euros ($92.59 billion) in 2009.
 Homolle has led the French division of German chemical
company BASF in Levallois, just outside Paris, since 2002. He
was named chairman of the UIC in June for two years.
 
 M&A REBOUND
 The chemical sector took a blow at the end of 2008 and the
start of 2009 when clients stopped ordering goods on a large
scale in order to use up their stock, forcing chemical companies
to improve efficiency and halt production.
 Demand recovered when growth in emerging markets, in
particular Asia, took off again and European governments began
supporting key sectors of the economy such as the car and
construction industries.
 ""The behaviour of the players across the value chain is
prudent, but it's a prudence I'd say is rather confident,""
Homolle said. ""One does not easily forget the plunge that began
at the end of 2008 when suddenly the brakes were put on
brutally.""
 A revival in mergers and acquisitions shows that the
chemical industry has pulled out of the doldrums. In France,
Rhodia and Arkema have made some small acquisitions and have
said they are ready for more.
 The most prominent so far this year is the planned takeover
of Danish food ingredients maker Danisco by U.S. chemicals group
DuPont. Last year acquisitions included BASF's purchase of
Cognis and DSM's takeover of Martek Biosciences.
 ""I think the rebound in acquisitions will continue after the
hole in 2009 because the structure of companies has improved,
because they see a better future. It's a vote of confidence in
the future,"" said Homolle.
 He identified innovation coupled to sustainable development,
in which chemical companies pursue growth in products that
respect the environment, as well as booming emerging markets as
developments that will support the industry.

 By Natsuko Waki
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Emerging economies,
seen as the big hope for global growth this year, are caught in
a tricky dilemma: let inflation rip and hurt stability or raise
rates and risk stalling their economies.
 Policymakers and business leaders at the World Economic
Forum starting on Wednesday in Davos will look at ways for
emerging economies to keep the engine of growth revving without
stoking inflation.
 Developing countries have so far been reluctant to raise the
cost of borrowing, as higher interest rates would attract even
more capital inflows and push up local currencies, hurting
export competitiveness.
 Emerging nations are all too aware of their role in keeping
the world economic recovery on track. The International Monetary
Fund drove home that point on Tuesday, saying a slowdown in
these economies would deal a serious blow to global growth.
 Concerns are intensifying that emerging market monetary
authorities may be behind the curve in tackling inflation. If
inflation got out of control and aggressive policy measures
became necessary, that could send these economies into a hard
landing, damaging the rest of the world.
 ""There's a real risk that being behind the curve in
addressing inflation, inflation takes root and then the second
round effects will be more damaging for these countries and also
for the world economy,"" said Michala Marcussen, head of global
economics at French investment bank Societe Generale.
 ""That's why if you think about the risks for the global
economy today, the risk is more that something nasty comes out
of emerging markets than advanced economies.""
 Investors are already becoming nervous about the prospect of
inflation surprises in the emerging markets. 
 Emerging market stocks, as measured by MSCI <.MSCIEF>, hit
two-week lows earlier this week, underperforming their developed
market counterparts <.MIWD00000PUS>.
 According to its updated economic outlook, the IMF expects
emerging economies to grow 6.5 percent in 2011 against a 2.5
percent expansion in the developed world.
 It cited inflation as the key risk for emerging economies
and said tighter monetary policies were needed. 
 ""Many countries are close to potential,"" IMF head of
research Olivier Blanchard told a news conference.
 ""That probably means that in a number of countries monetary
policy may need to be tightened in order to maintain inflation
under control.""

 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 WALKING ON A TIGHT ROPE
 A flood of cheap money -- created as a result of ultra-easy
monetary policy in the developed economies -- is the root of the
inflation problems in the emerging world.
 Fund tracker EPFR estimates emerging market equity and bond
funds attracted almost $150 billion in 2010, compared with $93
billion in 2009.
 The Institute for International Finance expects 2011 equity
portfolio flows to emerging markets to ease to $143 billion in
2011 from an estimated $186 billion last year, although they are
still more than double the $62 billion annual average of 2005-9.
 Based on a monetary policy rule developed by U.S. economist
John Taylor, a central bank whose inflation is above target
should have positive real rates to tackle price pressures.
 But real rates in many emerging economies are near zero.
 For example, Turkey cut its benchmark rate to 6.25 percent
in a surprise move last week, raising concerns about the
direction of monetary policy. The central bank has just upgraded
its 2011 inflation forecast to 5.9 percent.
 Emerging central banks do have another policy tool in their
inflation battle: allowing currencies to appreciate gradually.
 ""They should've been more aggressive than they were in the
past. You would think that if their inflation-targeting
programme becomes bigger in scale, they may give more ground to
currencies to appreciate,"" said Michael Dicks, chief economist
at Barclays Wealth in London.
 As part of efforts to quell inflation, China is set to let
the yuan rise further this year. A Reuters poll showed the yuan
would hit 6.3 per dollar by end-2011, a rise of around 5
percent, compared with last year's 3.6 percent rise.
 The Chinese currency has now gained nearly 26 percent
against the dollar since July 2005.

 * No evidence of Southeastern Asset Management wrongdoing
 * Southeastern, ACS did not act in concert

(Adds detail, background, BaFin comment_
 FRANKFURT, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A probe by German regulator
BaFin exploring what role a major investment fund played in
Spanish builder ACS's moves to take control of German peer
Hochtief, yielded no evidence of impropriety. 
 In a statement on Wednesday, Germay's regulator BaFin said
it had found no evidence that Southeastern Asset Management and
ACS had acted in concert.
 BaFin further said a revised ACS takeover offer for
Hochtief, from December, was admissible.
 ""During the investigation, no evidence was found that oral
or written deals on joint-purchases of Hochtief shares were
agreed on,"" BaFin wrote.
 Earlier this month BaFin said that it was investigating the
possibility that Southeastern Asset Management had illegally
acted in concert with ACS, throughout the Spanish builder's
bidding process.
 The U.S. fund manager holds stakes in both the German and
Spanish construction groups. Its decision to tender half its 5
percent Hochtief stake to ACS's all-stock offer proved critical
in getting the Spanish group over a key 30 percent threshold.
 At the time, Southeastern denied any wrongdoing. ACS has
said it had not collaborated with shareholders during its bid
for Hochtief, and that the Spanish company, led by Real Madrid
soccer club president Florentino Perez, had complied with German
law.
 ACS wants control of Hochtief's strong balance sheet to ease
its own debt burden of more than 9 billion euros ($12 billion)
and help it diversify away from Spain's struggling construction
and property sectors.
 Take a Look on Hochtief/ACS:
 Factbox on EMEA IPO pipeline:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ACS's nine-for-five all-share offer, which values Hochtief
at around 4.1 billion euros at current share prices, was
designed to take its stake across the 30 percent regulatory
threshold.
Last Friday, ACS said that its stake in Hochtief had risen
to 31.6 percent, from 30.34 percent when a first tender period
for its all-share bid ended on Dec. 29.
 ACS is expected to announce the result of its current
takeover offer on Feb. 3.

 * Dollar broadly weak ahead of FOMC
 * Fall in U.S. yields undermines dollar
 * Pound licks wounds after surprisingly weak UK GDP
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a 10-week low
against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, with the market
looking for confirmation from the Federal Reserve later in the
day that its focus remains on supporting growth.
 The perception that the Fed will keep a much easier policy
than the European Central Bank, which is growing worried about
inflation, has helped the euro to extend its recovery after a
two-month drubbing from worries over euro zone debt.
 The dollar extended losses for a fourth day, after U.S. bond
yields fell on news of President Barack Obama's proposal to
freeze portions of federal spending in his State of Union
address.
 ""U.S. bond yields fell yesterday so I'm not sure how much
further they are going to fall after the FOMC. But, on the whole,
sentiment for the dollar seems weak,"" said a trader at a Japanese
bank.
 The dollar index against a basket of major currencies dipped
to 77.864, just a hair above a 10-week low of 77.814 hit earlier
in the week.
 Analysts expect the U.S. central bank will keep short-term
rates near zero and will say it remains committed to its $600
billion bond purchase programme, known as QE2.
 That stands in stark contrast with the ECB. Governor
Jean-Claude Trichet has warned about rising inflation in the
region, sparking speculation that the ECB may raise rates later
this year and helping to widen the euro's rate advantage over the
dollar.
 In the interest rate swap market, the spread between two-year
rates in the two currencies jumped to 110 basis points --
approaching a two year high and up sharply from 73 basis points
just three weeks ago.
 The euro also benefited from strong demand for the inaugural
bonds from Europe's financial rescue fund on Tuesday.
 PROFIT-TAKING
 Asian investors, including the Japanese government, took up
more than one-third of the 5 billion euro ($6.84 billion) offer,
although the Japanese government has said it would use euro cash
in its foreign currency reserves to buy the bonds.
 The euro stood at $1.3685, near a two-month high of $1.3705
hit on Tuesday and within sight of a 61.8 percent retracement of
its November-January fall, around $1.3740.
 Beyond that, its Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 is seen as a major
target.
 ""It doesn't seem like there are stretched euro long positions
in the market. I see more upside for the euro,"" said another
Japanese bank trader.
 But some oscillators such as the slow stochastic and the
14-day RSI signal the currency might be overbought in the near
term, pointing to a possible setback after a strong 6 percent
gain in little more than two weeks.
 Some market players suspect the Fed's policy meeting could
provide a good pretext for profit-taking in the euro, which
several analysts see as inevitable.
 Since hitting a four-month low of $1.2860 on Jan. 10, the
euro has posted substantial losses only one day and is due for a
correction, said Masato Chin, president of Chin Associates.
 Chin added that the euro was likely to rebound, however, and
head for $1.40, with the dollar set to fall after the formation
of a clear double top on the dollar index chart over the past few
months.
 ""The dollar index will inevitably fall to around 76. It's a
textbook case of a double top,"" Chin said.
 The British pound recouped early losses but remained shaky
after an unexpected contraction in the UK economy in the fourth
quarter prompted investors to scale back expectations of a rate
hike by the Bank of England.
 The pound fetched $1.5822, flat on the day. It had fallen as
low as $1.5750 on Tuesday.
 Against the resurgent euro, the pound was near a 2-1/2-month
low of 0.86695 per euro hit on Tuesday. It last traded at 0.8652.
 The dollar slipped about 0.2 percent against the yen to 82.05
yen, not far from last week's two-week low of 81.85 yen.
 Traders say bids below 82 yen are likely to support the
dollar for now. It also has trendline support around 81.20.
 Still, it has fallen below the bottom of the daily ichimoku
cloud, now at 82.36, which is considered as a major bear signal.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on
Tuesday called on Congress to pass a free trade agreement with
South Korea ""as soon as possible,"" but offered no timetable for
action on two other pacts with Panama and Colombia.
 The South Korea ""agreement has unprecedented support from
business and labor, Democrats and Republicans, and I ask this
Congress to pass it as soon as possible,"" Obama said in his
annual State of the Union speech.
 But the failure to set any time frame for enacting the
other two deals was a disappointment for Republicans, who want
prompt action on all the trade agreements left over from the
administration of former President George W. Bush.
 ""I strongly believe that we should consider all three
agreements in the next six months,"" House of Representatives
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said earlier on
Tuesday at a hearing on the pacts.
 ""This deadline isn't driven by politics or posturing. It is
driven by the need to create jobs for American workers,"" the
Michigan Republican said, calling the three pacts ""a sure-fire
way to create American jobs by growing U.S. exports.""
 Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, and Senator Joseph
Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, also said on Tuesday they
would push for a vote on a congressional resolution urging
quick approval of all three trade pacts.
 Obama's specific call for Congress to pass the South Korean
agreement followed a recent renegotiation to address concerns
raised by the U.S. auto industry.
 It had complained the original version failed to tear down
barriers to South Korea's auto market, while phasing out
remaining U.S. tariffs on South Korean cars.
 The other deals have been delayed by concerns among
Democrats about human rights in Colombia and tax haven laws in
Panama.
 Obama mentioned the two pacts in his speech, but gave no
indication when he would send them to Congress.
 ""Before I took office, I made it clear that we would
enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals
that keep faith with American workers, and promote American
jobs. That's what we did with Korea, and that's what I intend
to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia, and
continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks,"" he said.
 Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said the
United States needed to quickly enact all three pacts or it
risked falling behind competitors such as the European Union
and Canada that are aggressively pursuing new deals.
 ""The rest of world is moving forward without us, at the
expense of America's workforce. For example, Caterpillar is
waiting to export more bulldozers made in Illinois to Colombia
under a free trade agreement signed in 2006 but never
implemented,"" Grassley said.
 The Obama administration is negotiating a regional free
trade agreement with eight other countries in the Asia Pacific
region that it hopes to substantially complete by the time it
hosts the annual APEC leaders summit in November.
 Some trade analysts also see a window of opportunity this
year for the United States and other countries to conclude the
long-running Doha round of world trade talks.

 SINGAPORE, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held near a
10-week low against a basket of currencies on Wednesday ahead of
a statement from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to
reaffirm the central bank's focus on supporting growth.	
 U.S. stock index futures ticked higher after President
Barack Obama delivered the annual State of the Union address,
pointing to a modestly firmer opening on Wall Street on
Wednesday.	
 Obama proposed a freeze on domestic spending over the next
five years to help reduce the national deficit but analysts said
the speech provided no surprises.	
 ""The stock market should be fine with the spending freeze,""
said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New
York. ""People don't want additional stimulus here. This will
allow investors to focus on the Fed.""	
 
 Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.5 percent, giving back
some of the previous day's 1 percent rally, though other Asian
markets ticked up slightly.	
 The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
rose 0.1 percent. Since the start of the year,
it has underperformed the MSCI world index ,
which has risen almost 2 percent.	
 
 INFLATION WORRIES	
 Emerging Asian markets rose powerfully in 2010, but since
then some investors have taken profit, and some pulled money out
of economies they fear are the most vulnerable to the harmful
effects of inflation, a growing global concern.	
 ""Worries over monetary tightening will persist in the long
term, weighing especially on shares of producers dependent on
raw materials as their prices are still near all-time highs,""
said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan
Inc.	
 The perception that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain a
much easier policy than the European Central Bank, which is
worried about inflation, has helped boost the euro to near a
two-month high. 
 At $1.369, the euro hovered just below Tuesday's
two-month high of more than $1.37, which it achieved partly on
the strength of Asian buying of the euro zone's debut European
Financial Stability Facility bonds. 
 A pledge by the Fed, which concludes a two-day policy
meeting on Wednesday, to continue its $600 billion bond-buying
plan could further help the euro versus the dollar, analysts
said. A statement will be released at around 1915 GMT on
Wednesday.	
 Shares in LG Electronics , the world's No. 2 TV
brand and No. 3 mobile phone maker, fell around 4 percent ahead
of its fourth-quarter results statement, although they rebounded
after the release on hopes business conditions for the firm may
now pick up.	
 It reported a record quarterly loss on weakness in its main
businesses but a one-third increase in its shares since lows in
November reflect expectations the worst may be over.	
 Underlining concerns that the rising cost of food could
become a broader inflation problem for many economies, benchmark
Chicago wheat prices rose around 1 percent to $8.44-3/4 a
bushel in electronic trading on Wednesday.	
 That pushed them to their highest level since August 2008 on
demand for high-quality wheat, which is in tight supply.

 U.S. crude oil futures rose 21 cents to $86.40 per
barrel, following six days of consecutive losses during which
prices fell by almost 6 percent. 
 Those losses were driven by expectations of large U.S. oil
inventories, and concerns among investors and policymakers that
high commodities prices are fuelling inflation, which in turn
may slow economic growth.	
 Gold was little changed at $1,333.51 per ounce. It
hit a three-month low of $1,322.70 on Tuesday, knocked by
falling investor demand as an improving economic outlook lessens
gold's appeal as an asset which gains in value while other
financial instruments appear at risk.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a 10-week low
against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, with the market
looking for confirmation from the Federal Reserve later in the
day that its focus remains on supporting growth.
 The perception that the Fed will keep a much easier policy
than the European Central Bank, which is growing worried about
inflation, has helped boost the euro to near a two-month high.
 The dollar extended losses for a third day on Tuesday when
U.S. bond yields fell on the news that President Barack Obama
will propose a partial freeze on federal spending in his State of
Union address to the U.S. Congress due at 0200 GMT.
 ""U.S. bond yields fell yesterday so I'm not sure how much
further they are going to fall after the FOMC. But, on the whole,
sentiment for the dollar seems weak,"" said a trader at a Japanese
bank.
 The dollar index against a basket of major currencies stood
at 77.946, just above a 10-week low of 77.814 hit earlier in the
week.
 Analysts expect the U.S. central bank will keep short-term
rates near zero and will say it remains committed to its $600
billion bond purchase programme, known as QE2.
 The dollar's recent decline came as the euro recovers from
four-month low hit earlier this month, helped as worries about
euro zone periphery countries' debt problems ease and by talk of
possible credit tightening by the ECB later in the year.
 The euro stood at $1.3680, near a two-month high of $1.3705
hit on Tuesday, and within sight of a 61.8 percent retracement of
its November-January fall around $1.3740.
 Beyond that, its Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 is seen as a major
target.
 ""It doesn't seem like there are stretched euro long positions
in the market. I see more upside for the euro,"" said another
Japanese bank trader.
 The British pound extended losses after a shocking
contraction in the UK economy in the fourth quarter prompted
investors to scale back expectations of a rate hike by the Bank
of England.
 The pound fell 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.5780,
near Tuesday's low of $1.5750. Against a resurgent euro, the
pound was near 2-1/2-month low of 0.86695 per euro hit on
Tuesday. It last traded at 0.86605.
 The dollar was little moved against the yen at 82.25 yen, not
far from last week's two-week low of 81.85 yen. It fell below the
bottom of the daily ichimoku cloud, now at 82.36, which is
considered as a major bear signal.

European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso stressed in talks
on Tuesday the need for tighter coordination in the euro zone
and made no mention of disagreement about the bailout fund.
 The chancellor and Barroso met for dinner beyond the reach
of the media at a government guesthouse near Berlin and issued
only a brief statement about their meeting, which came after a
successful debut bond auction by the euro zone rescue fund.
 Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement that
the two had ""exchanged views about the situation of the euro"".
 ""At the centre of it were the need to reduce debt, the
future stability and growth pact and measures to improve the
competitiveness of the European Union,"" said the statement.
 The chancellor and commission chief agreed that ""stronger
coordination of economic policy in the euro zone is of the
utmost importance"".
 Barroso had warned ahead of the dinner with Merkel that the
currency bloc needed to avoid ""procrastination"", which was seen
as a reference to Berlin's outspoken rejection of his proposals
to increase the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 He wants the 440 billion euro fund, which was set up last
year after the Greek debt crisis and already tapped by Ireland,
to be beefed up to provide stronger defences for the euro.
 But Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble rule out
increasing the headline sum, wary in a year with seven regional
elections in Germany of exacerbating German taxpayers' annoyance
at having to fund bailouts for overspending euro zone partners.
 They are focusing instead on finding ways to maximise the
full capacity of the EFSF, whose lending clout is really only
about 250 billion euros because of the guarantee system required
to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 The EU's top economic official, Olli Rehn, was also in
Germany on Tuesday, attempting to persuade Merkel's junior
coalition allies, the Free Democrats (FDP), to soften their
opposition to increasing the fund.
 FDP leader Guido Westerwelle, the foreign minister and
deputy chancellor suffering a slump in popularity, said after
meeting Rehn that he was still not convinced the euro zone
bailout fund should be expanded.
 ""To discuss expanding the rescue fund today, when only 10
percent has been used, is not convincing,"" said Westerwelle.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended flat on
Tuesday, overcoming most of the session's losses as bargain
hunters bought equities late in the day, while the euro rose to
touch a fresh-two-month high against the dollar.
 The euro's rally was driven by increased optimism that
Europe will be able to manage its debt crisis.
 World stocks were pressured throughout the day after data
showed Britain's economy unexpectedly contracted at the end of
2010, while fears of inflation in Asia hit commodity prices.
 But on Wall Street, sentiment improved late in the day.
 ""There is more of a break trade, sort of a two steps up,
one step back type trade in U.S. equity markets,"" said John
Brady, MF Global's senior vice president for U.S. and global
interest-rate products.
 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> inched
lower for the day after earlier touching an intraday high that
was less than 15 points from the psychologically important
12,000 level. On Monday, the Dow also made a run toward 12,000
and then backed away.
 The front-month futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock
index <0#NK:> trading in Chicago rose 30 points to 10,440.
 U.S. crude oil futures  fell $1.68, or nearly 2
percent, to settle at $86.19 a barrel, copper hit one-month
lows and gold fell to its lowest in three months after India
raised interest rates, saying inflation may stay high for
longer than expected. [ID:nN25279633]
 India's rate increase rattled investors already concerned
by China's recent move to raise banks' required reserves and
its two rate hikes since the start of 2010.
 ""There is increasing concern about rising interest rates in
Asia,"" said Stephen Briggs, commodities analyst at BNP Paribas
in London. ""It's raising fear that liquidity in the global
markets will continue to shrink.""
 U.S. government bonds rose on a report that President
Barack Obama would propose a freeze on discretionary
non-security spending in his State of the Union address, which
will be broadcast live on television on Tuesday night.
 An index of pan-European shares <.FTEU3> ended down 0.6
percent after data showed a 0.5 percent decline in UK gross
domestic product in the fourth quarter as Britain's government
embarks on deep spending cuts. For details, see

 LATE SHIFT ON WALL ST
 U.S. stocks reversed losses in a late flurry of buying and
ended little changed as optimism about overall earnings offset
disappointment in results from blue chips 3M and Johnson &

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 3.33 points,
or 0.03 percent, to end at 11,977.19. But the Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 0.34 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to
finish at 1,291.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained
1.70 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 2,719.25.
 The Conference Board, a U.S. industry group, said its index
of consumer confidence jumped in January to the highest since
May 2010. [ID:nN25261699]
 The euro rose to a fresh two-month high above $1.37,
extending a six-day run of gains against the dollar as
investors hoped that European authorities will do enough to
contain the debt crisis in the months ahead.
 The euro rose to $1.3705 , its best level on the
day and its highest since late November, before easing to
$1.3695, up 0.4 percent.
 The euro's volatility throughout the day was partly due to
the 440-billion-euro fund, the European Financial Stability
Facility's (EFSF) inaugural debt issue.
 Speculation that the new issue would be massively
oversubscribed boosted the euro in early trade, but those gains
were eroded when investors who built up euros to buy EFSF debt
sold them back.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of major currencies, slipped 0.19
percent. Sterling  slid 1.01 percent to $1.5833 late in
the New York day.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.35
percent at 82.18 after U.S. bond yields extended losses
following solid demand for the sale of $35 billion of two-year
notes. Lower yields make dollar-denominated assets less
attractive.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
climbed 19/32, with the yield at 3.3303 percent. The 2-year
U.S. Treasury note  was up 2/32, with the yield at
0.584 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
up 35/32 -- slightly more than a full point -- with the yield
at 4.491 percent.
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB>, a global benchmark
for commodities, was down 1.54 percent on worries about
economic tightening in Asia.
 Spot gold prices  fell $2.15, or 0.16 percent, to
$1,332.10 an ounce. Copper , which is used in power and
construction, hit a one-month low -- falling 2.77 percent to
$9,265 a tonne, while tin hit a record high on supply
concerns.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a
two-month high above $1.37 on Tuesday and looked poised to
extend gains as momentum turned increasingly bullish after the
currency's recent break above key chart levels.
 A pledge by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which concludes a
two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, to continue its $600
billion bond-buying plan could further help the euro versus the
dollar, analysts said. A statement will be released at around
2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT) on Wednesday.
 ""If you look at the technical factors, which are going to
be more important in the short run, there's probably scope for
a retest of those previous highs just below $1.38,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New
York.
 ""Our stance is that the European authorities will do enough
to contain the debt crisis in the coming months. And that
leaves the dollar vulnerable against the euro as long as the
Fed continues its Treasury purchases,"" he added.
 The euro's rise in late New York trade on Tuesday extended
a six-day rally against the dollar. Traders said the euro's
solid break above the $1.35 area last week was significant and
suggested a run toward $1.3786, the Nov. 22 high.
 In late trading, the euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.3695,
after having earlier risen as high $1.3705  on trading
platform EBS.
 The euro zone's single currency has gained about 6.5
percent since hitting a low around $1.2860 on Jan. 10.
 Near-term resistance lies around $1.3738, the 61.8 percent
retracement of fall that began in early November and ended two
weeks ago. A break above that would add to bullish momentum.
 Traders said early euro volatility was partly due to the
European Financial Stability Facility's (EFSF) inaugural debt
issue.
 The order book for the issue closed with bids valued at 43
billion euros for the 5 billion euros of paper on offer, a
source at the EFSF said. [ID:nBRU011276]
 Speculation the new issue would be massively oversubscribed
boosted the euro in early trade, but gains were eroded when
investors who built up euros to buy EFSF debt sold them back.
 Gains were also limited after Guido Westerwelle, head of
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior coalition partners,
said that he was still not convinced the euro zone bailout fund
should be expanded. [ID:nBAT005953]
 The dollar weakened broadly, falling just below 82 yen, as
U.S. bond yields fell. Lower yields make dollar-denominated
assets less attractive.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose after a report that President
Barack Obama would propose a freeze on discretionary
non-security spending in his State of the Union address Tuesday
night. Solid demand at an auction of $35 billion of two-year
notes also pressured yields. See [ID:nN25498829]
 ""The dollar/yen is the most sensitive to interest rate
differentials and we do not see that breaking down,"" said Mark
McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York.
 The dollar last traded down 0.3 percent at 82.22 yen
, after falling as low as 81.97 yen on EBS.
 Sterling dived after a surprise 0.5 percent contraction in
fourth-quarter UK gross domestic product, compared with
economists' forecasts of a 0.5 percent gain [ID:nAHLOCE7CK].
The pound fell to a session low  of around $1.5750.
It last traded down 1 percent at $1.5830. Against the pound,
the euro jumped almost 1.5 percent to its highest in
two-and-a-half months. .
 ""The UK GDP may be a warning sign of what is to come in
Europe. Market participants may reassess the rate hike
scenarios which had led to a short squeeze,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
 A close below $1.5922 on sterling/dollar would be bearish,
said CitiFX Technicals in a note. Current moves argue for a
move to at least $1.5345, the bank said.

 NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher against
the dollar in volatile trade on Tuesday and could extend gains
in the short term on positive technical momentum and growing
confidence Europe will be able to manage its debt crisis.
 The dollar weakened broadly, falling just below 82 yen, as
U.S. bond yields extended losses following solid demand for an
auction of Treasury debt. Lower yields make dollar-denominated
assets less attractive.
 The euro has rallied more than 6 percent against the dollar
since hitting a low around $1.2860 in mid-January. Traders said
the single currency's recent break above $1.35 was significant
and expect the euro to soon test $1.3786, its Nov. 22 high.
 A pledge by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which concludes its
two-day meeting on Wednesday, to continue its $600 billion
bond-buying plan could further help the euro versus the dollar,
analysts said. A statement will be released at around 2:15 p.m.

 In afternoon trading, the euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3659,
after having earlier risen as high $1.3688 on trading platform
EBS, the highest level in two months.
 Traders said euro volatility was partly due to the European
Financial Stability Facility's (EFSF) inaugural debt issue.

the euro zone bailout fund should be expanded.
 The dollar lost 0.4 percent to 82.11 yen, after falling as
low as 81.97 yen on EBS.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose after a report that President
Barack Obama would propose a freeze on discretionary
non-security spending in his State of the Union address.
Treasuries extended gains, with the 30-year bond climbing over
a full point in price, after solid demand for $35 billion of
two-year notes. See
 ""The dollar/yen is the most sensitive to interest rate
differentials and we do not see that breaking down,"" said Mark

 Sterling dived after a surprise 0.5 percent contraction in

economists' forecasts of a 0.5 percent gain.
 The pound fell to a session low of around $1.5750. It last
traded down 1.3 percent at $1.5786. The euro rose to its
highest in three weeks against the pound.

 * Barroso to meet Merkel, warns against delays

(Adds Merkel with Barroso, quotes, background)
 BERLIN, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Germany's Guido Westerwelle, head
of Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior coalition partners, said on
Tuesday after meeting the top EU economic official he was still
not convinced the euro zone bailout fund should be expanded.
 ""To discuss expanding the rescue fund today, when only 10
percent has been used, is not convincing,"" Westerwelle, who is
foreign minister and deputy chancellor, said after Olli Rehn,
the European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, met
members of Westerwelle's Free Democrat Party (FDP).
 The Merkel government's wariness of a headline raise in the
European Financial Stability Facility puts it at loggerheads
with European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso, who wants
the 440 billion euro fund increased to defend the euro.
 Rehn gave a speech to FDP members of parliament in which he
said the euro zone could get over its debt crisis this year and
should move towards automatic sanctions for debt sinners.
 ""If we show the necessary determination and courage, it is
possible Europe will overcome the debt crisis in 2011,"" he said.
 Such comments may have been directed at German taxpayers who
are showing donor fatigue from the Greek bailout and euro zone
rescue fund last year. Germany wants its euro zone partners to
commit to budget discipline in return for any more assistance.
 Barroso was due to meet Merkel for a private dinner later on
Tuesday, having said in a speech in Brussels it was important to
""avoid this trend to procrastination"", without naming Germany.
 Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble are keen to
find ways of beefing up the EFSF to maximise its full capacity,
currently limited to about 250 billion because of the guarantee
system required to maintain its triple-A credit rating.
 But the FDP, whose popularity has tumbled while Merkel's own
conservatives have benefited from her management of the economic
recovery, sees itself as champion of the taxpayer and as such
has spoken out against any increase in euro zone guarantees.
 ""We do not have a crisis in the euro, we have a debt crisis
in Europe. And the only sensible, bearable path is to combat the
causes and seek more discipline among member states,"" said
Westerwelle.

 By Stanley Carvalho
 ABU DHABI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - State-owned Abu Dhabi Ports Co
(ADPC) said it had no plans to issue bonds this year after
securing enough financing for its $7.2 billion Khalifa Port &
Industrial Zone through its lenders.
 Chief executive Tony Douglas also said on Tuesday he
expected 7 percent growth in container volumes in 2011 due to
the large pipeline of projects underway in Abu Dhabi, the
wealthiest emirate in the United Arab Emirates.
 ADPC said in July it may sell up to $1 billion in bonds in
the first quarter of 2011 and had appointed National Bank of Abu
Dhabi as financial advisor to draw up a long-term financial
strategy.
 On Tuesday, a company statement said: ""ADPC would like to
clarify that there have been no plans confirmed at any time for
the company to issue bonds.""
 Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, is investing
billions of dollars in infrastructure, real estate and tourism
to diversify its economy away from oil.
 ""The investment outlay for phase one of the Khalifa Port is
26.5 billion dirhams ($7.2 billion), all funded through
bilateral funding agreements with a number of banks,"" Douglas
told reporters at a conference organized by London-based MEED.
 ""We expect to see a 20 percent growth in 2011, that is
because one of our customers will be going into containers from
palletized shipping,"" Douglas said.
 ""But underlying growth expected is 7 percent,"" he said.
""Growth will be driven by mainly project cargo into Abu Dhabi
where significantly large projects are being developed.""
 Abu Dhabi's Mina Zayed port handled 518,000 TEUs (twenty
foot equivalent units), up 2 percent over the previous year,
Douglas said earlier on Tuesday.
 Mina Zayed's operations will move to the new Khalifa Port in
the fourth quarter of 2012, he said.
 When the Khalifa Port's first phase becomes operational in
2012, it will have capacity of 2 million containers and 9
million tonnes of cargo a year, four times higher than existing
capacity at Abu Dhabi's main Mina Zayed port.
 ""Ninety-five percent of containers that come to Mina Zayed
stays in Abu Dhabi -- It is a destination port, so Khalifa Port
will become a destination port.""

(Updates with European markets' close)
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday
after Britain's economy unexpectedly contracted at the end of
2010 and the euro retreated from a two-month high.
 Fears of inflation in Asia undermined confidence in the
global recovery, weighing on global stock indexes and
commodity prices.
 The euro was flat, pulling back from a two-month high in
volatile trading, after the euro zone rescue fund's first debt
offer.
 European shares fell after data showed a 0.5 percent
decline in UK gross domestic product in the fourth quarter as
Britain's government embarks on deep spending cuts. For
details, see [ID:nLDE70O19B]
 Commodity prices plunged on worries of a slowdown from
Asia's biggest consumer countries. U.S. crude oil futures
 fell 1.2 percent to $86.70 a barrel, copper hit
one-month lows and gold fell to its lowest in three months
after India raised interest rates, saying inflation may stay
high for longer than expected. [ID:nN25279633]
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose in anticipation of the
Federal Reserve's purchases of notes maturing from January
2015 to June 2016 amid a two-day Fed meeting that offered a
constructive backdrop.
 A U.S. industry group said its index of consumer attitudes
jumped in January to the highest since May 2010, but did
little to ameliorate investors' confidence. [ID:nN25261699]
 ""There is a risk-reduction trade sparked by the
weaker-than-expected GDP report in the UK,"" said John Brady,
MF Global's senior vice president for U.S. and global
interest-rate products.
 ""We also saw a continued fluid situation in Irish
electoral politics, and concerns about the capitalization of
Spanish banks, middle-tier banks, those combined have lent to
modest risk reduction.""
 European shares fell as confidence in Britain was shaken
by the unexpected drop in the UK's fourth-quarter GDP growth
figures and with Spanish banks' shares down on concerns that
new capital requirement rules may not be tough enough.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top
shares fell 0.6 percent to close at 1,144.14 points, with
Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> down 0.4 percent.
 Banco Santander  and BBVA  fell 3.5
percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, lagging the sector,
after Spanish banks were told to increase core capital ratios
to at least 8 percent by September or risk a partial takeover
by the state, as some fear it is not enough to build
confidence in the sector.
 U.S. stocks fell, weighed down by disappointing blue-chip
earnings.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 26.72
points, or 0.22 percent, at 11,953.80, off a fresh 52-week
high of 11,985.97. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was
down 3.59 points, or 0.28 percent, at 1,287.25. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 6.01 points, or 0.22 percent,
at 2,711.54.
 The euro wallowed between positive and negative territory
against the dollar, but ultimately fell from a two-month high
after the euro zone rescue fund's first debt offer was
oversubscribed and prompted selling.
 The euro  was up 0.03 percent at $1.3647. Against
the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.11 percent at
82.38 from a previous session close of 82.470.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the dollar's
performance against a basket of major currencies, edged up
0.06 percent. Sterling  slid 1.14 percent to $1.5808 per
pound.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.28
percent. Tokyo's Nikkei average <.N225> had climbed 1.2
percent to close at 10,464.42 on hopes of upbeat company
earnings.
 The European Financial Stability Facility, the 440 billion
euro fund being used to bail out Ireland, launched its debut
bond issue, with demand dwarfing the 5 billion euros on
offer.
 A source at the EFSF said it closed the order book with
demand at 43 billion euros, a sign of confidence in the
facility. [ID:nLDE70O0U2]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 8/32, with the yield at 3.379 percent. The 2-year U.S.

give a lift to the global economy. [ID:nJAT007100]
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB>, a global benchmark
for commodities, was down 1.42 percent on worries of economic
tightening in Asia.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2011 12:59PM ET</span>",US promises changes to controversial trade method," * U.S. says makes efforts to comply with WTO zeroing rulings
 * EU and Japan say U.S. moves are not enough
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The United States promised its
trading partners on Tuesday that it would make changes to a
controversial method for calculating duties on unfairly priced
imports.
 But Japan and the European Union said assurances that
Washington would comply with repeated condemnations from dispute
panels and the appeal court at the World Trade Organization did
not go far enough and left many questions unanswered.
 The United States has been isolated at the WTO by its
support for zeroing -- a method used by the Department of
Commerce (USDOC) to calculate anti-dumping duties that has been
rejected by every other one of the trade body's 153 members.
 U.S. trade officials say the adverse rulings go beyond
current international trade agreements, and have promised to
fight for zeroing to be recognised in the Doha round
negotiations for a new global trade deal.
 ""However, the United States recognises the systemic
importance of compliance with dispute settlement findings,"" a
U.S. official told the WTO's dispute settlement body.
 ""To that end we have devoted significant resources to comply
with the recommendations and rulings in this and other zeroing
disputes,"" he said in a status report on Washington's efforts to
comply with the rulings in recent cases.
 
 ISOLATED
 International trade rules allow members to impose duties on
goods that are dumped -- sold for less than they cost at home,
if that damages businesses in the importing country.
 Setting anti-dumping duties often involves comparing batches
of goods. In zeroing, the authorities ignore examples where the
imported goods actually cost more than they do at home, which
critics say unfairly inflates the duties.
 On Dec. 28 the Commerce Department said it proposed changing
the methods it uses in reviewing existing anti-dumping duties.
It would compare monthly average prices and offset them when
export prices turn out to be higher.
 This would bring the practice for review into line with what
the department is already doing on initial investigations.
 The U.S. official said the administration would hold
consultations on the proposal with congressional committees
following a period for public comment ending on Jan. 27.
 Japanese and EU officials welcomed the proposal, but a
Japanese official said it was not clear whether it would fully
meet the WTO rulings and could leave open the possibility of
using methods that were inconsistent with WTO rules.
 An EU official expressed similar concerns.
 ""While this proposal by USDOC is a step in the right
direction it should be clear that the proposal -- even if
adopted and implemented correctly -- will not bring about full
implementation, unless it is supplemented by additional
measures,"" the EU official said.
 Washington should say what it was going to do in cases where
exporters in other countries had paid duties now found to be in
excess of WTO rules, the EU official said.
 Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, the EU, Japan, Mexico,
South Korea and Thailand have all won WTO cases over zeroing,
and the United States currently faces another challenge from
Vietnam. Because of the consistent jurisprudence, Washington did
not even contest the South Korean, Thai and Ecuador claims.
 Japan and the EU are seeking and Mexico is threatening
sanctions over the cases.

Tuesday ahead of a final World Trade Organization ruling on
claims Boeing received subsidies, in a tit-for-tat case brought
by the European Union over similar U.S. claims against Airbus.
 An Airbus spokeswoman said in a statement that the report,
which sources close to the case expect to be distributed to the
parties on Jan. 31, would confirm Boeing got ""massive illegal
subsidies"" from research grants.
 The European planemaker also predicted these would be found
to be more harmful than contested European loans to Airbus.
 ""We expect at least $45 billion as a realistic figure for
retaliation,"" she said by email, without elaborating on what
form of retaliation this might entail.
 A spokesman for Boeing said illegal European subsidies to
Airbus which the WTO has already identified in a previous case
""dwarf"" those at issue in the European counter-suit.
 ""There is no comparison between the over $20 billion in
subsidies that the WTO said Airbus received, and the less than
$3 billion that the WTO is reported to have found in a
preliminary ruling against the US,"" the spokesman said by email.
 The report, which will not be made public for several weeks,
is the latest round of legal ping-pong between the European
Union and United States over mutual claims their aircraft
industries have been unfairly shielded from competition. 
 The EU claimed victory after a confidential interim report
found in September that Airbus rival Boeing had received several
billion dollars of aid, but the two sides disagreed publicly
over the severity of the judgment. 
 That ruling followed WTO condemnation last June of illegal
European subsidies for Airbus, mostly in the form of government
launch-aid loans. These findings came in an earlier case brought
by the United States, which is now the subject of appeal.

 * Trade deficit shrinks 32 percent from 2009
 * Exports boosted by strong auto demand, higher oil prices
(Adds background, analyst comment, byline)
 By Patrick Rucker
 MEXICO CITY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Mexico narrowed its trade
deficit in 2010 compared with a year earlier as the country's
manufacturing exports swelled while oil trade surpluses also
climbed, the national statistics agency said on Tuesday.
 Mexico posted a deficit of $3.121 billion in 2010, a 32
percent decline from 2009 when it was $4.602 billion, the
government's INEGI statistics institute said.
 Mexico's total 2010 exports were $298.4 billion, a 29.8
percent increase from the previous year.
 Roughly 80 percent of Mexico's exports are absorbed by the
United States.
 Increased demand north of the border helped lift Mexico's
non-oil exports by 29 percent in 2010 to $256.7 billion.
 Mexico's auto plants notably expanded exports last year,
increasing 53 percent from 2009. They accounted for $65 billion
out the total $246 billion in manufacturing exports in 2010,
which climbed 29.5 percent from 2009.
 Higher oil prices also gave a boost to Mexico, the
sixth-largest oil producer in the world, with petroleum exoprts
up 34.8 percent in 2010 to $41.7 billion.
 Mexico's total 2010 imports also increased, climbing 29
percent to $301.5 billion.
 The economic picture has recently brightened for Mexico as
the U.S. economy returns to health and the finance ministry
expects an expansion of between 4 and 5 percent this year.
 Inflation has also been surprisingly muted in Latin
America's second-largest economy with the government expecting
prices to rise around 3 percent in 2011, in line with the
central bank's forecasts.
 STRONG EXPORTS
 The Mexican economy is expected to have expanded by about 5
percent in 2010, going a long way to erase the 6.1 percent
contraction in 2009.
 A healthy export sector should strengthen Mexico's finances
overall, Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note.
 ""The balance of payments picture remains solid,"" wrote
economist Alberto Ramos. ""Current account remains well anchored
by the trade balance (while) the capital account has been
generating steady surpluses -- anchored in recovering (foreign
direct investment) and other capital inflows.""
 That surge of foreign investment has recently driven up the
value of the peso and Mexican officials have said they are
watchful that sudden currency gains do not create economic
imbalances [nLDE70O1KC].
 A strong peso, for instance, could raise the price of
Mexican exports causing damage to that sector.
 Mexico posted a $219 million trade deficit  in
December, the agency said, expanding from a revised trade
deficit of $105 million in November.

 * Euro swings between gains and losses but ultimately lower
 * Sterling tumbles after UK Q4 GDP shrinks unexpectedly
(Updates prices, adds detail, quotes)
 NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro swung between gains
and losses against the dollar on Tuesday but ultimately fell
from a two-month high after the euro zone rescue fund's first
debt offer was oversubscribed and prompted selling.
 Comments from German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister
Guido Westerwelle on Tuesday rejecting calls for an increase in
the euro-zone rescue fund added to the euro's woes. Westerwelle
comments to WDR radio station were reported by Dow Jones.
 The British pound dived after a shock contraction in the UK
economy last quarter.
 ""We had a junior German coalition partner saying they're
not convinced that expanding the ESFS is the way to go,"" said
Brian Dolan, chief strategist, Forex.com, Bedminster, New
Jersey. ""That suggests there is some dissent within the German
government about extending the bailout facility, and that's
taken some juice out of the euro.""
 Midway through the New York session, the euro was trading
0.1 percent lower at $1.3626, well short of the session high of
$1.3688 on trading platform EBS though off the session low of
$1.3573.
 Euro volatility was partly due to the European Financial
Stability Facility's (EFSF) inaugural debt issue.
 The order book for the issue closed with bids valued at 43
billion euros for the 5 billion euros of paper on offer, a
source at the EFSF said.
 Speculation the new issue would be massively oversubscribed
boosted the euro in early trade, but those gains were eroded
when investors who built up euros to buy EFSF debt sold them
back.
 Still, the dip prompted others to move in. The euro got a
bid on buying by a Middle East name and Irish and Dutch banks.
That faded quickly as Westerwelle's comments circulated.
 ""From a chart perspective, we've tried the upside and the
downside and not broken through either way,"" said Dolan. ""If we
close in a $1.3610-30 range, that will be an unchanged day and
a second straight day of indecision.""
 ""That suggests a neutral bias that can be resolved either
way, but frequently, I take it as a sign of caution that the
upside could be exhausted,"" Dolan added.
 The dollar was last down 0.1 percent at 82.44 yen on EBS.
 DOWN POUND
 Sterling tumbled after a surprise 0.5 percent contraction
in fourth quarter UK GDP due to adverse weather, compared with
economists' forecasts of a 0.5 percent gain. The pound
fell to a session low of around $1.5750. It last traded down
1.2 percent at $1.5803. The euro rose to its highest in three
weeks against the pound.
 ""The UK GDP may be a warning sign of what is to come in
Europe. Market participants may reassess the rate hike
scenarios which had led to a short squeeze,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
 Some economists said the surprisingly poor reading
suggested the Bank of England would be much more cautious about
the threat of lasting inflation, which would weigh down the UK
currency.
 Others argued the impact of persistent price pressures on a
weak economy would heighten the risk of stagflation, which
would also be negative for sterling.
 A close below $1.5922 on sterling/dollar will be bearish,
said CitiFX Technicals in a note. Current moves argue for a
move to at least $1.5345, the bank said.
The Swiss franc rallied broadly, rising sharply against the
euro and the pound. The euro fell 0.4 percent to around 1.2894
francs due to position adjustments.

 * Euro hovers near two-month high against dollar
 * IMF urges action on banks, boost for rescue fund
 
 By Jonathan Gould and Luke Baker
 FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The debut bond from
Europe's financial rescue fund attracted robust demand on
Tuesday, in the latest sign of confidence the bloc is getting to
grips with the debt crisis that has haunted it for over a year.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cautioned in a report
that Europe still had work to do to restore faith in its
economies, urging rigorous stress-testing of its banks and a
strengthening of the rescue fund, known as the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 But the successful bond sale and a tentative rally in the
debt of vulnerable countries on Europe's southern periphery in
recent days has offered hope that the euro zone may be finally
turning the corner, even if its diverging economies and high
debt seem sure to plague it for years to come.
 Describing intrest as ""exceptionally strong"", The EFSF said
its bond sale had attracted orders from more than 500 investors
totalling 44.5 billion euros -- roughly nine times the 5 billion
euros of paper on offer.
 Demand from Asian investors was particularly robust, with
the Japanese government buying over 20 percent of the issue.
 ""The huge investor interest confirms confidence in the
strategy adopted to restore financial stability in the euro
area,"" said the EFSF's German Chief Executive Klaus Regling.
 Funds raised from the 5-year bond will be used to help
finance the bailout of Ireland, which followed Greece last year
in seeking a rescue to cope with a financial meltdown in its
banking sector.
 Weeks ago, fears were rife that euro zone contagion would
spread from Ireland to Portugal and Spain, stretching the 440
billion euro EFSF to the busting point.
 But European leaders are now contemplating changes to the
rescue fund which have helped calm jittery markets. The euro
has risen 7 cents against the dollar over the past two weeks to
reach a two-month high above $1.36.
 And the risk premiums investors demand to hold Portuguese
and Spanish debt instead of rock-solid German benchmarks have
fallen back, although they edged higher in thin trade on
Tuesday.
 
 NEW POWERS
 Among the steps euro zone leaders are considering is an
increase in the effective capacity of the EFSF, which for
technical reasons can only lend about 250 billion euros, and
giving it new powers to buy bonds directly or make loans to
troubled countries, possibly so they can buy their own bonds.
 Other ideas include reducing the interest rates Greece and
Ireland are forced to pay under their rescues. Many economists
believe Greece and Ireland, which are both pushing through
draconian budget cuts, will ultimately be forced to restructure
their debt unless new steps are taken to relieve their burden.
 But Germany is resisting pressure from its partners to
implement quick changes to relieve struggling euro members, in
part because they might be frowned upon by German voters, who
will go to the polls in several states in the coming months.
 Speaking in New York, German Deputy Finance Minister Joerg
Asmussen said lower interest rates for Greece and Ireland were a
possibility, but only if the countries were willing to enshrine
new fiscal rules in their constitutions. Germany has been
pushing its euro zone partners to adopt the same ""debt-brake""
rule it introduced in 2009, but faces fierce resistance.
 Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also reiterated
that Berlin saw no reason to expand the EFSF, as EU officials
and the IMF have recommended.
 Shock news that Britain's economy contracted by 0.5 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2010 served as a reminder on Tuesday of
just how vulnerable European economies remain as they slash
spending and boost taxes to rein in swollen deficits..
 Another note of caution came from Ireland's central bank
governor Patrick Honohan, who told Reuters in an interview that
Irish banks were likely to face higher prospective loan losses
after the completion of a new capital review.
 
 POLITICAL BACKLASH
 Tough austerity programmes are raising pressure on euro zone
politicians and sowing doubts about whether governments will
stick to ambitious savings goals as voters turn on them.
 Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen is expected to be booted
out of office in an early election next month and the parties
likely to form the next government are vowing to renegotiate
aspects of the country's EU/IMF rescue deal.
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has won
plaudits from the markets for his economic reforms, but with
uneployment rising, his party faces a drubbing in crucial
regional elections in May and a national vote next year..
 Europe's largest economy, Germany, remains an exception.
Last week the government raised its 2011 growth forecast to 2.3
percent and on Tuesday, data showed consumer morale pushing up
to its highest level since October 2007.
 Against this complex economic and political backdrop,
European leaders may struggle to reach a consensus on the
""comprehensive package"" of anti-crisis measures they have
promised to unveil at a March summit.
 Berlin is pushing for closer economic coordination, but only
on its own terms. It would also like to see more automatic
sanctions for deficit sinners.
 Ahead of a meeting with Merkel at a German government estate
north of Berlin on Tuesday evening, European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso cautioned against complacency, and
in an apparent dig at Germany warned against ""procrastination"".
 ""One of the messages from the markets is clear -- let's not
react behind the curve,"" he said.

 Commodity prices plunged on worries of a slowdown from
Asia's biggest consumer countries. U.S. crude futures 
fell 1.6 percent to $86.50 a barrel, copper hit one-month lows
and gold fell to its lowest in three months after India raised
interest rates, saying inflation may stay high for longer than
expected. [ID:nN25279633]
 U.S. Treasuries erased gains after a U.S. industry group
said its index of consumer attitudes jumped in January to the

 ""The UK news overnight was a reminder that it's really
growth that matters right now, and we saw stagnation in the UK
during the fourth quarter. That also puts a spotlight on
ongoing weakness in peripheral Europe and probably diminishes
ECB rate hike expectations,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""But in the U.S., we've got a strong consumer confidence
number, so the story comes back around to the U.S. economic
outlook, which looks stronger than Europe's or the UK's. That
should bode well for the dollar against sterling and the euro.""
 The euro came off a two-month high after an oversubscribed
euro zone rescue fund's first offer of debt. The euro 
was down 0.07 percent at $1.3633. Against the Japanese yen, the
dollar  was up 0.10 percent at 82.55.
 The dollar <.DXY> was up 0.18 percent against a basket of
major currencies, while sterling  was down 1.17 percent
at $1.5812 per pound.
 U.S. stocks fell, weighed down by disappointing blue-chip
earnings.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 51.35

to impress investors.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.51
percent with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
of top shares dropping 0.63 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei average
<.N225> rose 1.2 percent on hopes of upbeat company earnings.
 The weak UK growth fanned concerns over the global economic
recovery, while scepticism over the cost of recapitalizing
Spanish banks weighed on euro zone peripheral government bonds
and Spain's stocks <.IBEX>.
 Spain's weak savings banks have seven months to boost
capital through private investors or the state will partially
take them over, Economy Minister Elena Salgado said on Monday,
adding that their total capital requirements should not exceed
20 billion euros. [ID:nLDE70N1M0]
 The European Financial Stability Facility, the 440 billion
euro fund being used to bail out Ireland, launched its debut
bond issue, with demand dwarfing the 5 billion euros on offer.
 A source at the EFSF said it closed the order book with

 With a two-day rate-setting meeting by the Federal Reserve
set to begin on Tuesday, U.S. Treasury prices erased some gains
after the consumer confidence data.
 Stronger-than-expected economic news tends to hurt U.S.
Treasuries because it can deplete the risk-averse trade that
benefits safe-haven U.S. government debt.

headline)
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - German Deputy Finance Minister
Joerg Asmussen on Tuesday said the euro zone might consider
lending more cheaply to crisis ridden members via emergency
loans if they incorporate fiscal conditions into their national
constitutions.
 Asmussen stressed Germany does not believe their is a
crisis in the euro currency and that Berlin would do whatever
is necessary to defend the stability of the euro zone.
 Asked if there was any condition under which Germany would
accept a lower interest rate on its emergency loans under the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Asmussen said
yes.
 ""Yes, there is now a certain margin on, let's say EFSF
loans or the loan to Greece. We can look at this if countries
at the same time would be willing to accept a kind of national
fiscal framework to be enshrined in their constitution, yes,""
the influential deputy said.
 ""It has to be clear that interest rates as part of an
EU/IMF programs are set in a way that there are clear
incentives for the countries concrned to return to markets,"" he
said.
 Asmussen, speaking at a conference on the European debt
crisis sponsored by Bloomberg, stressed there was a need for
greater financial coordination between member states going
forward in order to avoid the crises that have hit member
states such as Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.

 * Nuclear champion France lags neighbours on wind projects
 * Targets 23 percent of power use from renewables by 2020
 
 (Updates with Ecology Minister comments)
 By Yann Leguernigou and Muriel Boselli
 SAINT-NAZAIRE/PARIS, France, Jan 25 (Reuters) - France
unveiled on Tuesday a 10 billion euro ($13.6 billion) plan to
build its first offshore wind project in a bid to catch up with
European neighbours in the development of renewable energy.
 France, which produces 74 percent of its electricity from
nuclear power plants, will build 600 offshore wind turbines with
a total capacity of 3,000 megawatts, said President Nicolas
Sarkozy, adding they would be built in the western regions of
Loire-Atlantique, Brittany and Normandy.
 ""We are launching this first tender covering five
development areas for offshore wind power in order to give the
industry's players greater visibility,"" Sarkozy said.
 A delay in the French tender -- initially expected in
September -- had led to anxiety among industrial companies,
which said they needed the government's commitment in order to
build the facilities to manufacture wind power turbines.
 Manufacturers of offshore wind turbines include Germany's
Siemens and Denmark's Vestas, but there are none in France,
where capacity so far is nonexistent.
 ""We have all the assets to build an industrial sector and
even to become the leader in offshore wind power,"" France's
Ecology Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told Reuters.
 ""We have everything we need to develop the industrial sector
first of all at home before starting to export,"" she said,
adding that France also had favourable port infrastructure.
 PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report last month the
country had the means to catch up with the technology.
 The project -- one of the world's largest with a power
production capacity equivalent to that of three small nuclear
reactors -- will create 10,000 jobs, said Sarkozy, adding
candidates would be picked at the start of 2012.
 France will launch the tender the second quarter of 2011.
 French renewable energy lobby SER said it was crucial for
the government to favour reliable companies rather than those
with the cheapest projects.
 ""We already have sitting on our shelves 3,000 MW in offshore
wind projects in France, which has the potential for a total
offshore wind power capacity of around 10,000 MW,"" Andre
Antolini, head of SER, told Reuters.
 
 BRITAIN FAR AHEAD
 France aims to build wind power capacity of 25,000 MW by
2020 for an investment of 20 billion euros to meet its goal of
generating enough green energy to cover 23 percent of demand.
 Wind power currently represents less than 2 percent of
France's output capacity, compared with 7 percent in Germany.
 Britain, which has nearly 1,700 offshore wind turbines under
construction, approved or in the application stage, targets
32,000 MW of offshore wind by 2020 -- enough to meet a quarter
of the country's power needs.
 Other offshore programmes are being developed in Belgian,
Danish, Dutch, German, Irish and Swedish waters. 
 Vestas, Germany's Repower and France's Alstom could figure
among the bidders. 
 French utilities EDF, its wind arm EDF Energies Nouvelles,
or rival GDF Suez could submit proposals to operate the wind
farms.
 One megawatt produced by offshore wind power costs 3.5
million euros, against 1.6 million for one megawatt generated by
onshore capacity, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report said.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2011 11:07AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Irish banks' prospective loan losses may rise-c. bank," By Carmel Crimmins and Marc Jones
 DUBLIN, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Ireland's banks will likely face
higher prospective loan losses following the completion of a new
capital review agreed under an 85 billion euros EU/IMF bailout
programme, the country's central bank governor said on Tuesday.
 Irish banks' spiralling property losses and inability to tap
private funding forced Dublin to request external assistance
last year and investors want reassurance that the 35 billion
euros ($48 billion) earmarked for the banks under the bailout
will be sufficient.
 The central bank will complete its second capital review of
the banks and a review of their liquidity requirements by the
end of the first quarter.
 ""The prospective loan losses will probably be a little
larger,"" Patrick Honohan told Reuters in an interview from the
seventh floor of the central bank building in central Dublin.
 ""We had a base case and a stress case in our March 2010
estimates and if I were a betting man I would say it would be
moving up from the base case. That would not be surprising given
the somewhat more disappointing economic statistics since then.""
 Honohan said Dublin had not yet convinced markets that it
had got to the bottom of the banks' losses but providing clear
information about their portfolios should help soothe concerns.
""What we are trying to do is to get precision. It's much
more important to get precision than to land on a particular
number. If we achieve that we will go a long way towards getting
to the situation where the banks and the government can return
to the market.""
 To ensure Irish banks are bullet-proofed against further
shocks, Honohan has insisted that they ""overcapitalise"" beyond a
new core Tier 1 capital ratio of 12 percent and some 10 billion
euros of the EU/IMF package will be used to achieve that.
 The EU/IMF plan is also designed to wean Irish banks off
their dependence on ECB funding and exceptional loans from the
central bank in Dublin, which together amounted to 183 billion
euros at the end of the year.
 Honohan said the central bank would set out a timeframe for
reducing the banks' reliance on such funding.
 ""Timeframes are going to be defined. They haven't been
defined yet,"" he said. ""We are relying very much on external
advisors who are closer to securitisation markets.""
 
 STABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
 Since agreeing to the EU/IMF bailout in November, Ireland's
government has been in crisis and Prime Minister Brian Cowen's
government looks set to fall victim to the debt crisis.
 The main opposition parties, Fine Gael and Labour, are in
pole position to form a new coalition government after an
election likely in late February.
 Both parties have said they would like to alter the terms of
the bailout package but Honohan said he didn't expect a change
of administration to affect Ireland's commitment to its targets.
 ""The main opposition parties, from everything they have
said, are fully committed to the scale of fiscal adjustment,"" he
said.
 ""They might want to change A, B, or C by replacing A, B or C
with D, E or F but they completely bought into the concept that
any changes have to be neutral in fiscal terms.""
 ""I think that the months ahead will see a consolidation of a
stable political situation. That's going to be a good basis for
completing the programme that we are embarked on.""
 Both Fine Gael and Labour would like some senior bondholders
in Irish banks to share some of the losses but Honohan said such
a proposal was unlikely to become policy.
 ""I don't see any traction around that idea, taking
everything into account, including the fact that European
partners make it quite clear that this is a very unattractive
proposal.""
 Whoever forms the next government will face a very weak
Irish economy particularly as Ireland tackles one of the worst
budget deficits in Europe.
 ""We are projecting, I would say quite a weak 2011,"" said
Honohan. ""The recovery is very gradual.""

(Updates throughout, with more from hearing)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans on
Tuesday vowed to press for early action this year on trade
deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia that they said have
delayed by Democrats for too long.
 ""I strongly believe that we should consider all three
agreements in the next six months,"" House of Representatives
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said at a hearing
on the pacts signed between November 2006 and June 2007.
 ""This deadline isn't driven by politics or posturing. It is
driven by the need to create jobs for American workers,"" the
Michigan Republican said, calling the three pacts ""a sure-fire
way to create American jobs by growing U.S. exports.""
 The South Korean pact was snagged by objections it would
open the U.S. auto industry to more competition, while the
other deals have been delayed by Democrat concerns about human
rights in Colombia and tax haven laws in Panama.
 Camp gave President Barack Obama credit for renegotiating
the South Korean agreement last year to address auto industry
concerns, and taking other steps to set the stage for votes on
that pact in Congress this year.
 ""Unfortunately, the administration has not taken the same
productive approach to the Colombia and Panama agreements. I
hope that the president lays out such a timetable in his
address tonight,"" Camp said, referring to Obama's annual State
of the Union speech to Congress.
 The Obama administration has said for two years it wants to
work with Colombia and Panama to address concerns about those
two pacts, but has avoided saying when it hopes to submit the
agreements to Congress for a vote.
 NO BUNDLING
 Representative Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the
committee warned Republicans against bundling the three trade
deals into single package for a vote.
 But without committing to a specific timetable for
congressional approval, Levin also said he was now more
optimistic of resolving Democratic concerns that have blocked
the Panama and Colombia deals.
 Through the efforts of the Obama administration and
congressional Democrats, ""there is now the prospect of
successfully addressing tax haven and labor law concerns with
the Panama FTA,"" Levin said.
 Levin, who recently traveled to Colombia on a factfinding
mission, said he was also encouraged by new President Juan
Manuel Santos' approach to anti-union violence and other labor
concerns raised by Democrats.
 ""Throughout my discussions, there seemed to be a wide
agreement that the new Colombian government was expressing a
different approach than its predecessor on these critical
issues,"" Levin said.
 ""I believe there is now an opportunity for the two
governments to work together mutually to achieve real progress
on the ground,"" Levin said.
 The National Association of Manufacturers, the American
Farm Bureau Federation, Ford Motor Co, FedEx and MetLife all
testified in support of the pacts.
 Steve Biegun, a vice president at Ford, said the changes to
the Korean agreement negotiated by Obama administration in
December were ""a truly great achievement.""

 * EU considering stockpiling critical raw materials
 
 (Adds details, reaction, background)
 By Pete Harrison and Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The European Union will
consider stockpiling raw materials and will confront any country
that restricts supplies, according to a European Commission
strategy document.
 ""The EU will continue to pursue barriers hampering the
sustainable supply of raw materials to the EU economy,"" said a
draft paper seen by Reuters on Tuesday, which will feed into a
strategy review to be launched before April.
 Shortages of rare earth minerals used in high-tech and
defence production, have sent jitters around the world since
dominant producer China restricted exports.
 The strategy includes examining whether to propose a
stockpiling programme for the most critical raw materials.
 Fourteen such materials are already listed by the
Commission, including rare earths such as germanium, which is
used in military fibre-optic systems and infrared optics, and
gallium, which is used in LED lighting.
 ""The Commission will suspend -- totally or partially -- from
the General System of Preferences (GSP) countries that apply
unjustified restrictions to raw materials,"" it added, referring
to the EU's list of preferred trading partners.
 Development campaigners Traidcraft said the EU stance
threatened the development of minerals that African countries
need to pull themselves out of poverty.
 ""In its bid to get access to cheap raw materials, the EU is
threatening to undermine the very basis for countries' future
development,"" said Traidcraft's Liz May. ""It is critical that
developing countries are able to use all necessary policy tools
to add value to their raw materials.""
 
 LAUNCH DELAY
 The Commission, the executive for the 27-member bloc and
which initiates EU policy, had intended to launch the strategy
alongside one for food commodities on Wednesday.
 It has now delayed the launch to settle a dispute over the
role of speculation on food prices, after French President
Nicolas Sarkozy called on Monday for new rules to curb commodity
price volatility.
 The draft gives an insight into the Commission's plans for
metals and minerals, although one official said it was likely to
change in the weeks ahead.
 It highlights possible shortages of wood, paper, leather and
rubber, but its main focus is a looming shortage of rare earths,
which could hamper Europe's progress in strategic technologies
such as electric cars and military surveillance.
 ""Demand emanating from foreseeable technical innovations may
for example increase more than 20 times for gallium between 2006
and 2030 and eight times for indium and germanium,"" said the
draft strategy paper. It foresaw a seven-fold increase in demand
for neodymium, which is used in glass, lasers and magnets,
during the same period.
 ""Materials which have not been labelled critical today, for
example lithium, may potentially be considered 'critical' in the
future, driven for instance by market developments and
technological innovations,"" the paper added.
 Lithium is used in batteries for many hybrid electric cars,
a market that is expected to start booming a decade from now.
 The draft also called on the 27-nation EU to improve its
recycling technologies and stop millions of tonnes of raw
materials from leaving Europe each year in the form of scrap
electronics and cars.

 * Sterling tumbles after UK Q4 GDP shrinks unexpectedly
(Updates prices, adds quote, detail)
NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro came off a two-month
high on Tuesday with more losses seen near term after an
oversubscribed euro zone rescue fund's first offer of debt,
while the pound dived after a shock contraction in the UK
economy last quarter.
 Dollar buying against the pound on stop loss orders had
already pressured the euro but the order book for the European
Financial Stability Facility's (EFSF) inaugural debt issue
closed with bids valued at 43 billion euros for the 5 billion
euros of paper on offer, a source at the EFSF said.
[ID:nBRU011276]
 Speculation the new issue would be massively oversubscribed
boosted the euro in early trade, but those gains were quickly
eroded when investors who had built up euros to buy EFSF debt
sold them back.
 ""Euro/dollar traded at $1.3680 early in the London morning
before reversing sharply down to $1.3580 on a stop driven
dollar buy frenzy following the UK GDP numbers,"" said Brad
Bechtel, managing director at Faros Trading LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. ""The oversubscribed EFSF was also blamed as bids
not filled had to sell accumulated euro.""
 Speculation about potential interest rate increases in the
euro zone and Britain eased as the poor UK GDP data switched
investors' focus to worries about growth rather than
inflation.
 Expectations the European Central Bank would lift interest
rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve underpinned the single
currency this month, more so after talk on inflation and
interest rates by ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet on the
weekend.
 In early New York trade, the euro was trading 0.3 percent
lower at $1.3594 , easing from an earlier high of
$1.3688 on trading platform EBS. Traders cited selling by macro
funds, a German bank and Asian central banks.
 Traders said the euro would need to hold above $1.3570 -- a
50 percent retracement of its decline from November to early
this month -- on a sustained basis to extend its gains. 
 DOWN POUND
 Sterling tumbled after a surprise 0.5 percent contraction
in fourth quarter UK GDP due to adverse weather, compared with
economists' forecasts of a 0.5 percent gain [ID:nAHLOCE7CK].
 The pound fell some 1.4 percent against the dollar to a
session low  of around $1.5750. The euro rose to its
highest in three weeks against the pound .
 ""The UK GDP may be a warning sign of what is to come in
Europe. Market participants may reassess the rate hike
scenarios which had led to a short squeeze,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
 Some economists said the surprisingly poor reading
suggested the Bank of England would be much more cautious about
the threat of lasting inflation, which would weigh down the UK
currency.
 Others argued the impact of persistent price pressures on a
weak economy would heighten the risk of stagflation, which
would also be negative for sterling.
 The Swiss franc rallied broadly, rising sharply against the
euro  and the pound . The euro fell 0.9
percent to around 1.2832 francs due to position adjustments.
 Markets offered limited reaction to strong results at an
auction of Treasury bills in Spain, which added to signs that
perceptions of weaker euro zone economies are improving.
[ID:nLDE70O0JW]
 Analysts said Tuesday's successful issuances were not
enough to instil more optimism into the euro. ""Ultimately the
auctions did not significantly change the picture for the
euro,"" one London-based trader said.
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 82.37 yen ,
unaffected after the Bank of Japan kept its policy unchanged as
expected.

(Recasts throughout with auction result, reactions)
 By Luke Baker and Jonathan Gould
 BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The debut bond issue
for the fund being used to bail out Ireland was hugely
oversubscribed on Tuesday, prompting the fund's head to suggest
it could be a turning point in the euro zone's debt crisis.
 The European Financial Stability Facility's (EFSF) 5 billion
euro offer was nine times oversubscribed, partly on Asian demand
which included the Japanese government buying up over 20
percent.
 Fund chief Klaus Regling said the auction matched Ireland's
request for a 3.3 billion euro loan and should put to rest any
worries about the euro zone debt crisis.
 ""It may well be a turning point,"" Regling told a news
conference in Frankfurt.
 ""We have already seen in the last few weeks that the markets
have changed their attitude towards the euro. They understand
better today that, indeed, the euro area countries will do
everything to maintain price stability in the area,"" he said.
 Michael Leister, a debt strategist at WestLB in Dusseldorf,
said the high demand would ""be interpreted as showing there is
confidence in this mechanism and, as a consequence, in the whole
euro system"".
 The euro came off a two-month high after the auction having
risen in early trade on the expectations.
 The 440 billion euro ($600 billion) EFSF was set up in May
last year after the Greek crisis to help any heavily-indebted
euro zone member state unable to raise funding in the market.
 It is AAA-rated and was always expected to attract strong
interest. The fund said the implied borrowing cost was 2.89
percent, which is only slightly higher than ultra-safe German
government debt with an equivalent maturity.
 The EFSF said it closed the order book with demand at 44.5
billion euros and 500 investors taking part, in a stamp of
confidence for the 17-country euro zone.
 
 ATTRACTIVE TO ASIA
 ""The idea that the euro might disappear, that the euro area
might disintegrate, is absurd, and more and more people in the
market are realising this now,"" Regling told reporters.
 The government of Japan alone bought over 20 percent of the
issue as bids from Asia were particularly strong. Asked if China
was among the bidders, Regling said only that no major global
players were missing.
 ""It was always going to go well with the likes of the
Japanese and Chinese reserve fund managers -- and probably a
whole heap of others -- piling into it like there's no
tomorrow,"" said Marc Ostwald, strategist at Monument Securities.
 German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said the strong
demand showed EFSF volume was sufficient and reflected
confidence in Europe's ability to act.
 The EFSF was set up after Greece was forced into a bailout
and can borrow on the market using 440 billion euros of
guarantees provided by euro zone governments.
 Together with the 60 billion euro European Financial
Stability Mechanism and 250 billion euros from the International
Monetary Fund, the EU has in theory a total of 750 billion euros
available to tackle any future bailouts after Ireland.
 However, because of cash buffers and other guarantees built
into the EFSF to ensure it retains a AAA rating, its effective
lending capacity is estimated to be only 250 billion euros,
which restricts how many bailouts it could handle.
 Ireland received an 85 billion euro EU/IMF bailout in
November, with around 18 billion euros of that due to come from
the EFSF and 22.5 billion coming from the EFSM, a fund backed by
European Union member states and also AAA rated.
 Debt market analysts said the large order book for the EFSF
bonds showed just how much appetite there was among investors
for top-grade, AAA rated debt.
 ""Feedback we're getting from accounts is that they're
welcoming this new asset class,"" said WestLB's Leister.
 ""They will be less liquidity than German Bunds or French
paper but overall I expect them to have decent secondary market
liquidity,"" he said.

 * No need for capital controls in Mexico
 * Growth 4-5 pct in 2011, around 5 pct in 2012
 
 (Adds details)
 PARIS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Mexican Finance Minister Ernesto
Cordero said on Tuesday that the government was ""paying a lot of
attention"" to the peso currency's appreciation but he did not
think controls on capital inflows would be appropriate for
Mexico.
 Cordero also said that data on Monday showed that Mexican
inflation was cooling and that this was also helping the peso to
stabilise.
 The Latin American country was on track for growth of 4-5
percent this year, and ""around 5 percent"" in 2012, he said.
 ""In Mexico, the inflationary process is trending downwards
and it is very probable that we will end the year in accordance
with the Bank of Mexico's forecast which is around 3 percent,""
Cordero told a news conference.
 Asked about the strength of the peso currency, he said: ""It
is something which we are paying attention to very carefully at
the moment ... In the particular case of Mexico, the real
appreciation of our currency is probably the least in the
region, for many reasons but mainly because inflation in Mexico
is very low.""
 Cordero said Mexico's export sector was not especially
sensitive to currency issues as it benefited from other
competitive advantages, such as geographical location, a solid
skills base and low transport and logistics costs.
 ""It is not clear that establishing capital controls would be
very effective in the medium term. In the case of Mexico, we do
not think it would be very effective,"" he said.
 Turning to France's G20 proposal for a financial
transactions tax, Cordero said Mexico -- which takes over the
presidency of the group in November -- was in general not
favourable to this.
 ""We do not consider it prudent or adequate for the reality
of Mexico, a country where we are trying to increase financial
penetration,"" he said.

 * To submit proposed changes to EU Commission on Weds
 * No evidence of dioxin-contamination in Hungary
 
(Adds detail, more comments)
 BUDAPEST, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Hungary may ease temporary
restrictions on the consumption and sale of German hogs and pork
products after talks with Germany and the European Commission, a
Hungarian agriculture ministry official said on Tuesday.
 Hungary's agriculture minister had ordered the restrictions
and nationwide checks until Feb. 28 in the wake of an alert that
began on Jan. 3, when German officials said feed tainted with
highly poisonous dioxin had been fed to hens and pigs.
 Eggs, poultry meat and some pork at the affected farms were
contaminated.
 Hungarian agriculture ministry state secretary Endre
Kardevan told a news conference that the latest checks showed no
evidence of dioxin contamination in Hungary and that Budapest
would ease its stance following recent talks with EU partners.
 ""Hungary will review its resolution on the examination of
German shipments,"" Kardevan said. ""We will amend or eliminate
the provisions that are disproportionate or too strict with
regard to EU law.""
 Kardevan said Hungary decided to ease restrictions on German
hog and pork products after Monday's talks between Hungary's
agriculture minister, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer
Policy John Dalli and German farm minister Ilse Aigner.
 The European Union will also propose new regulations in the
coming weeks to try and avoid a repeat of Germany's recent
dioxin contamination alert in animal feed.
 Kardevan said these new proposals as well as Germany's
presentation at a meeting of EU farm ministers on Monday of
controls implemented to contain the dioxin alert had provided
sufficient reassurance for Hungary.
 Hungary will submit its revised proposals to the Commission
on Wednesday, Kardevan said, adding that in the meantime last
week's restrictions would remain in effect.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2011 08:23AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-High feed costs hurt Dutch pig farms -farm group," * 10 percent of pig farms could close down this year
 * Meat prices will pick up by end 2010
 * Dutch dairy, flower sectors leading exporters in 2011
 
 By Ivana Sekularac
 THE HAGUE, Netherlands, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Low meat prices
combined with the high cost of animal feed could force pig farms
to close in the Netherlands, which exports 70 percent of its
production, the head of the Dutch farmers association said.
 Albert Jan Maat said high feed prices, pressure from animal
rights groups and environmentalists and increasing competition
from non-EU countries is adding to the cost of pig production.
 ""Every year some 3 percent of pig farms close down, but this
year I think it will be up to 10 percent,"" Maat said.
 The Netherlands had a total of 4,050 pig farms in 2009,
which produced 1.3 million tons of meat, according to official
statistics. Its main export markets are Germany, Greece and
Italy.
 The European Commission said on Monday it would soon approve
financial aid to help pig producers cover the cost of storing
their meat for several months until pork prices recover.
 ""It is a good short-term measure,"" Maat said.
 He said pig farmers were under pressure from animal rights
groups and environmentalists to improve conditions for animals
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which also makes their
products more expensive.
 There is a public debate in the Netherlands, the only EU
country with an animal rights group represented in parliament,
about the number of animals that may be kept on farms.
 ""The pig sector should maintain good relations with those
organisations to get better position on the market,"" Maat said.
 He said pig meat prices could pick up by the end of this
year, paving the way for recovery of the sector. 
 ""Prices usually follow the trend in animal feed,"" he said.
 
 BRIGHT FUTRE
 Maat said he expected overall agricultural exports to grow
between 5 and 10 percent in 2011, with flowers, vegetables and
dairy leading the growth.
 Flower exports were hit in the 2008 crisis, and the recovery
will be linked to economic activity, Maat said.
 ""We are looking to the German market as the most important
one, and we are seeing some signs of recovery there,"" he said.
 Dutch agricultural exports rose 8.7 percent year-on-year in
2010 to 65.8 billion euros ($89 billion), helping to boost the
country's total exports to 370 billion euros and widen its trade
surplus from 35.4 billion to 40 billion euros, the government
said last week.
 Maat said a weakening of the UK pounds and of currencies in
central and eastern European countries will make Dutch products
more expensive and affect exports.
 He saw potential for Dutch dairy farming to adopt
sustainable methods, such as combining energy production and
livestock breeding by using animal waste to produce biogas.
 ""There is a possibility of coupling energy production with
livestock breed,"" he said. ""They can put solar panels on barns
and produce solar energy.""

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2011 08:19AM ET</span>",POLL-ANALYSTS VIEW-Gold seen gleaming still brighter in 2011," LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Precious metals are expected to
build on a stellar 2010 this year as risk aversion and
persistently low interest rates boost their allure, a Reuters
poll showed on Tuesday.
 Expectations for gold's performance have risen sharply, with
the survey of 65 leading analysts, traders and fund managers
predicting gold will average $1,450 an ounce this year, well
above its record high of $1,430.95 an ounce.
 A similar poll in July found most respondents expected gold
to average $1,228 an ounce in 2011. Last year the average LBMA
gold fixing was $1,225.60 an ounce.
 Below are a selection of comments from respondents to the
survey. All prices are in dollars per ounce.
 
 GOLD
 2011 2012
 Mean $1,454.52 $1,471.27
 Median $1,450.00 $1,420.00
 No of F'casts 65 49
 Spot gold was bid at around $1,330 an ounce by mid-morning
on Tuesday.
 
 JAMES STEEL, ANALYST, HSBC
 ""We believe that gold will continue to attract safe-haven
buying from risk-averse investors this year, as European Union
sovereign debt concerns persist. The Federal Reserve is likely
to continue with its programme of quantitative easing (QE) in
2011 to prevent deflation from taking root, while the pace of
economic activity in the emerging world will likely remain
strong, igniting inflation fears...The combination of continued
QE in the U.S. and rising inflation pressures in the emerging
world is a particularly bullish cocktail for gold.""
 
 HOU XINQIANG, ANALYST, JINRUI FUTURES
 ""Changes in the geopolitical situation will trigger changes
in foreign policies and relations between major countries, which
may influence gold prices. The economic recovery in the U.S. and
the euro zone is another key issue which will drive gold prices.
In addition, market liquidity, which is mainly determined by the
shifts and timing of shifts in monetary policies in the euro
zone and the U.S., will amplify moves in gold prices.
Speculative buying has been a key player in gold's rally in the
past two years and will continue to push prices in the future.
On the demand side, emerging markets, such as India and China,
should be closely watched.""
 
 ROBIN BHAR, ANALYST, CREDIT AGRICOLE
 ""There are enough things to keep us worried going forward.
In a year's time, hopefully there will have been some kind of
resolution of the euro zone debt situation, and maybe then we
will start to worry about the U.S. deficit or the deficit in
Japan. So the fear factor won't totally be alleviated. There
will always be something that the markets will have to worry
about. For portfolio diversification, there will still be people
wanting to diversify further into gold.""
 
 ONG YI LING, ANALYST, PHILLIP FUTURES PTE
 ""The slow and uneven recovery of the global economy will
likely mean relatively loose monetary policy to stimulate
growth. The U.S. Fed has to unwind its asset purchases first
before raising interest rates. It is thus unlikely to raise
rates until the end of 2011. Gold could be sought as a hedge
against uncertainty and alternative currency. Should gold prices
trend higher, other precious metals may also benefit from their
positive correlation with gold.""
 
 SUGANDHA SACHDEVA, RESEARCH ANALYST, RELIGARE COMMODITIES
 ""One more factor that will... drive gold prices will be the
launch of China's first fund Lion Global Gold Fund, (which) will
invest in gold-backed exchange traded funds overseas. This fund
could bring about a new wave of investment demand in the
country, and more such funds might enter the market.""
 
 SILVER
 2011 2012
 Mean $30.03 $30.36
 Median $29.83 $27.90
 No of F'casts 56 42
 Spot silver was bid at around $26.65 an ounce by mid-morning
on Tuesday.
 
 TOM KENDALL, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE
 ""When you look at the chart for silver since the back end of
August last year, you have to think that rate of appreciation in
the price surely can't continue, and I don't think it can in the
coming 12 months. But definitely the sentiment towards silver
from much of the investment market is still positive, and
industrial demand is strong.""
 
 FREDERIC PANIZZUTTI, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MKS FINANCE
 ""We expect silver to remain in the focus, as it shall
increasingly gain consideration as an alternative to gold in
investors' portfolios. Increased physical buying interest and a
wider community of buyers across the globe shall lead silver to
reach new highs. We would not be surprised if silver picked
somewhere between $45-$50 an ounce in 2011. This shall not
happen without high levels of volatility and several sharp
downside corrections.""
 
 DANIEL SMITH, ANALYST, STANDARD CHARTERED
 ""Silver has outperformed gold recently, but we feel that
there is now too much speculative froth in the market and it is
overdue a correction. As a result, we think silver prices will
pull back in the months ahead, especially if the U.S. dollar
strengthens, as we expect. However, the underlying fundamentals
are still good and we expect silver prices to benefit from
rising gold prices in the year ahead; and industrial demand in
China should remain supportive for most of 2011.""
 
 PLATINUM
 2011 2012
 Mean $1806.90 $1892.74
 Median $1800.00 $1900.00
 No of F'casts 46 38
 Spot platinum was bid at around $1,790 an ounce by
mid-morning on Tuesday.
 
 DAVID JOLLIE, ANALYST, MITSUI GLOBAL PRECIOUS METALS
 ""Over the short term, platinum looks likely to remain in
surplus. However, the medium term picture for platinum looks
more positive in terms of price appreciation: supply will remain
constrained and is likely to suffer from cost inflation,
supporting the price. Impending legislation to control emissions
from heavy duty and off-road diesel vehicles will be positive for
platinum demand.""
 
 SUKI COOPER, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL
 ""With more than three quarters of the world's platinum
supply mined in one country, risks to further growth in output
remain concentrated. Producers had indicated prices would need
to trade north of $1500/oz in order to support an increase in
output. Structural issues such as lower head grades, delays in
starting the coal-fired power stations and cost pressures
arising as a result of the strength of the rand have added to
mining difficulties. But serial challenges such as safety
related stoppages, industrial unrest and Eskom increasing its
power tariffs still persist, making for a murky supply outlook.""
 
 PETER FERTIG, CONSULTANT, QUANTITATIVE COMMODITY RESEARCH
 ""The authorities have taken measures to reduce new car
registrations in Beijing, but the risk is that this measure
would also be applied to other areas. This would be a negative
factor for the PGMs and is one reason that we expect the PGMs to
perform worse than gold and silver.""
 
 KOICHI IWANAGA, GENERAL MANAGER, SUMITOMO CORP
 ""Currently, auto catalyst users prefer palladium to
platinum. But between end 2011 and end 2012, a further rise in
palladium prices would force some users to buy platinum. The
shift would be accelerated if palladium prices rise to $1,000 an
ounce.""
 
 PALLADIUM
 2011 2012
 Mean $792.52 $838.35
 Median $795.00 $850.00
 No of F'casts 45 37
 Spot palladium was bid at just above $780 an ounce by
mid-morning on Tuesday.
 
 PATRICIA MOHR, VICE-PRESIDENT, SCOTIABANK GROUP
 ""Palladium is expected to be the top performing precious
metal, because of its use in auto catalytic converters in
small-engine, gasoline-driven cars. Strong auto sales in
'emerging' markets such as China and India and tightening
vehicle emissions standards by 2012 will drive up demand for
palladium, while supply will be constrained.""
 
 BERNARD DAHDAH, RESEARCH ANALYST, NATIXIS
 ""If talk that Russian palladium state supplies are running
low turns out true, then this will be a considerable factor
pushing palladium prices up. South African mine strikes and
electricity issues will remain a worry. Fund and speculative
buying will still play a role as many investors remain focused
on car sales. A slowdown in car sales from developing countries
might send a negative sign and lead to some outflows.""
 
 WALTER DE WET, ANALYST, STANDARD BANK
 ""Palladium remains our favourite in the precious metals
complex, with an estimated deficit this year of 440,000 ounces.
We see good value in palladium on approach of $700 an ounce.
Palladium could be in a fundamental deficit in 2011 for the
first time since 2007.""
 
 DANIEL SMITH, ANALYST, STANDARD CHARTERED
 ""We still believe that palladium is likely to outperform
platinum in the year ahead, although after the recent sharp rise
in the former we think the potential for outperformance by
palladium is now far more limited than it was. A strong auto
sector in China and the U.S. should keep prices on an upward
track, but additional sales of material from Russian stockpiles
represent the main downside threat to prices.""

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2011 08:15AM ET</span>",POLL-Gold's dream climb expected to plateau in 2012," * Gold seen averaging $1,450/oz in 2011, $1,420 in 2012
 * Low interest rates, dollar weakness seen as supportive
* Silver expected to track gold higher throughout this year
 By Jan Harvey
 LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Gold should build on last year's
stellar gains in 2011 to hit record highs, boosted by low
interest rates, dollar weakness and lingering worry over growth
in major economies, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
 But prices could plateau in 2012 as the global economy
gathers momentum, quantitative easing measures that have flooded
the markets with cheap money are reined in and interest rates
turn higher, analysts say.
 A poll of 65 analysts conducted by Reuters in early January
found a median 2011 gold price forecast of $1,450 an ounce, 18
percent higher than 2010's average London Bullion Market
Association (LBMA) gold fix of $1,225.60 an ounce.
 The forecast is also just above last year's record high of
$1,430.95, and clearly outstrips an average forecast of $1,228
an ounce returned by a similar poll conducted last July.
 ""The same reasons that were behind gold investment in 2010
will also drive prices in 2011,"" said Bayram Dincer, an analyst
at LGT Capital Management in Switzerland.
 ""You may have some dollar devaluation, and also an
expectation that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest
rates,"" he said. ""The fact that people will continue to hold
gold and further increase investment in gold makes us very
bullish for the precious metal.""
 Historically low interest rates in much of the world have
been a major support to gold prices in recent years. Low rates
cut the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold.
 While fiscal deficits and sovereign debt are likely to dog
Europe and the United States, rising inflation in fast-growing
economies like China, India and Brazil are also likely to lift
the metal's allure as hedge against rising prices in those
areas, analysts say.
 The poll showed analysts expect gold prices to rise
throughout the year, from $1,400 an ounce in the first quarter
to $1,432 in the second, $1,477 in the third and $1,520 in the
final three months of the year.
 But in 2012, expectations are tempered, with an average
price of $1,420 an ounce predicted.
 ""We see some weakness emerging in the second half and that
is a pattern in 2012 as the global economy returns to health,""
said London-based Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar.
 ""As all the classic measures of financial health start to
normalise, the great trade that we've had in gold will start to
unravel, and we will see a risk-on mentality.""
 
 SILVER LINING
 The same concerns that are seen lifting gold to record highs
are set to benefit silver, which is seen averaging $29.83 an
ounce this year, up from $20.19 last year. The average 2011
silver forecast returned by the July poll was $19.00.
 Silver touched a near 31-year high at $31.22 an ounce
earlier in January.
 The grey metal, which unlike gold has a large industrial
component to its demand base, is also expected to peak in the
fourth quarter at $31 an ounce, before easing back in 2012 to
around $27.90 an ounce -- still a historically strong level.
 A recovery in industrial production is expected to benefit
silver, which is widely used in electronics manufacturing.
 ""China and developed countries (are the main regions driving
demand), as silver is used in solar power panels, plasma display
panels and information technology,"" noted Koichi Iwanaga,
general manager of commodities at Japan's Sumitomo Corp.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro came off a two-month
high on Tuesday as the euro zone rescue fund's first offer of
debt attracted strong demand as expected, while the pound dived
after a shock contraction in the UK economy last quarter.
 Speculation about potential interest rate increases in the
euro zone and Britain eased as the poor UK GDP data switched
investors' focus to worries about growth rather than inflation.
 The order book for the European Financial Stability
Facility's (EFSF) inaugural debt issue closed with bids valued
at 43 billion euros for the 5 billion euros of paper on offer, a
source at the EFSF said. [ID:nBRU011276]
 Speculation the new issue would be massively oversubscribed
boosted the euro in early trade, but it was unable to extend
gains on the results as they did little to increase optimism for
a comprehensive solution to euro zone debt problems.
 ""Some positives had been priced in yesterday on news about
the size of the order books going into the issuance (so) today's
news adding to that was not a massive positive for the euro,""
said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi.
 Expectations the European Central Bank would lift interest
rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve have underpinned the
single currency this month due to tough talk on inflation and
interest rates by ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet.
 By 1149 GMT, the euro was trading 0.1 percent lower at
$1.3635 , easing from an earlier high of $1.3688 on
trading platform EBS. Traders cited selling by macro funds, a
German bank and Asian central banks.
 Initial support was seen around $1.3585, a key trendline off
the January lows, traders said. 
 Traders said the euro would need to hold above $1.3570 -- a
50 percent retracement of its decline from November to early
this month -- on a sustained basis to extend its gains.
 Sterling tumbled after a surprise 0.5 percent contraction in
fourth quarter UK GDP due to adverse weather, compared with
economists' forecasts of a 0.5 percent gain [ID:nAHLOCE7CK].
 The pound fell as much as 1.4 percent against the dollar to
a session low  of around $1.5750. The euro rose to 86.36
pence , its highest in three weeks.
 ""The UK GDP may be a warning sign of what is to come in
Europe. Market participants may reassess the rate hike scenarios
which had led to a short squeeze,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 Some economists said the surprisingly poor reading suggested
the Bank of England would be much more cautious about the threat
of lasting inflation, which would weigh down the UK currency.
 Others argued the impact of persistent price pressures on a
weak economy would heighten the risk of stagflation, which would
also be negative for sterling.
 The Swiss franc rallied broadly, rising sharply against the
euro  and the pound . The euro fell 0.4
percent to around 1.2870 francs due to position adjustments,
with near term support around 1.2770, the low hit on Jan. 18.
 
 DEBT AUCTIONS
 Markets offered limited reaction to strong results at an
auction of Treasury bills in Spain, which added to signs that
perceptions of weaker euro zone economies are improving.
[ID:nLDE70O0JW]
 Analysts said Tuesday's successful issuances were not enough
to instil more optimism into the euro. ""Ultimately the auctions
did not significantly change the picture for the euro,"" one
London-based trader said.
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.1 percent to 78.14, coming
off a 2-1/2 month low of 77.814 hit on Monday.
 The dollar was down slightly at 82.35 yen , unaffected
after the Bank of Japan kept its policy unchanged as expected.

(Adds comment)
 By Christina Fincher and David Milliken
 LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Britain's economy unexpectedly
shrank in the last three months of last year, prompting warnings
of a grim 2011 as the government embarks on the deepest spending
cuts in a generation.
 The figures also complicate life for the Bank of England,
which has come under fire for failing to keep a grip on
inflation but which will be reluctant to raise interest rates
when the economy is so weak.
 Finance minister George Osborne said the shock 0.5 percent
contraction would not derail his austerity plans, blaming the
drop in output on the harshest December weather on record.
 But even without the heavy snow, the economy would have
struggled to register any growth, according to the Office for
National Statistics.
 Evidence that Britain's economy was in trouble even before
the bulk of the budget austerity kicks in shocked financial
markets, braced for growth of between 0.1 and 0.6 percent.
 January's rise in value-added (sales) tax will only add to
the economic headwinds, making a bounce back at the start of
2011 unlikely.
 ""This is a horrendous figure. An absolute disaster,"" said
Daiwa economist Hetal Mehta.
 ""It seems that the economy is incredibly vulnerable. And
with the fiscal tightening yet to fully bite, we have to brace
ourselves for a bumpy ride.""
 The sharp reversal from growth of 0.7 percent in the third
quarter and 1.1 percent in the second sent the pound tumbling
more than a cent against the dollar.
 European shares and commodity prices also fell as the data
disappointment reverberated beyond Britain, the first G7 country
to report Q4 GDP numbers.
 
 STAGFLATION FEARS
 The figures both challenge the viability of the government's
austerity plan and leave ministers hoping the central bank will
be able to keep monetary policy loose and help deliver growth. 
 ""There is no question of changing a fiscal plan that has
established international credibility on the back of one very
cold month,"" Osborne said.
 ""One of the advantages of having a credible fiscal plan is
it gives the Bank of England the freedom -- and it's independent
in making these choices -- to keep interest rates lower for
longer,"" he later told BBC radio.
 Some economists, however, have warned of ""stagflation"" and
Ed Balls, opposition Labour's finance spokesman, criticised the
government's policy of ""slamming on the brakes"". 
 ""We always need to keep this economy moving, keep it
growing,"" he told the BBC. ""There is a plan B, there's a better
way to do this.""
 With UK inflation almost double the Bank of England's 2
percent target, the bank in turn is under growing pressure to
raise interest rates to stop expectations of high price growth
bedding down for years to come. 
 Stagflation, a term to describe a toxic combination of
moribund growth and rising prices, was coined in the 1970s when
inflation in Britain rose well into double-digits.
 At 3.7 percent, UK inflation is far from historic peaks but
well above U.S. levels of 1.5 percent and euro zone inflation
which has only just ticked above the European Central Bank's 2
percent comfort ceiling.
 
 NO EARLY RATE RISE
 Construction and service sector output both posted big
quarterly falls, the former dropping by 3.3 percent to record
its biggest quarterly decline since the start of 2009 when
Britain's economy was deep in recession.
 Although the data is backward looking, economists said it
highlighted how vulnerable growth was to negative shocks.
 The June short sterling contract leapt 14 ticks -- its
biggest one-day gain since last June's Budget as investors took
their bets on a May rate hike off the table.
 British interest rates have stood at a record low 0.5
percent since March 2009, when the BoE turned monetary stimulus
up to full throttle to deal with the recession.
 ""I think the data really confirms the idea that, given the
headwind the economy is facing, that this monetary stimulus is
still required,"" said Stuart Green, economist at HSBC. 
 IMF forecasts released before the GDP data suggested
Britain's economy would grow 2 percent in 2011, more slowly than
both Germany and the United States. Analysts said even that now
looked optimistic.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Sterling and British shares fell
on Tuesday following a shock contraction in UK economic growth
in the last three months of 2010, while the euro retreated after
hitting a two-month high against the dollar.
 The weak UK growth also fanned concerns over the global
economic recovery, hurting oil prices, while scepticism over the
cost of recapitalising Spanish banks weighed on euro zone
peripheral government bonds and Spain's stocks.
 Britain's economy suffered a shock 0.5 percent contraction

 (Adds details)
 By Suvashree Dey Choudhury and Tony Munroe
 MUMBAI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - India's central bank raised
interest rates on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point to
clamp down on resurgent inflation and warned of persistently
higher food prices unless steps are taken to boost supplies.
 Although the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has raised policy
rates seven times since March as the economy revived from the
global financial crisis, it said the balance of risks had tilted
towards stronger inflation and it was ready to respond if price
pressures increased.
 That backed expectations it will raise rates again in coming
months as home-grown price pressures are compounded by a surge
in global commodity prices now fanning inflation across emerging
markets.
 Indian bond yields and swap rates eased after the decision
as investors were relieved the central bank matched expectations
with a 25 basis-point rise in rates, rather than the 50
basis-point increase some investors had expected.
 ""India has a serious inflation problem, something officials
have been highlighting recently. I suspect the market would have
been looking for a bolder move in terms of a 50 basis points
move,"" said Jonathan Cavenagh, senior FX strategist at Westpac
Institutional Bank in Singapore.
 The RBI raised its repo rate, at which it lends to banks, to
6.5 percent from 6.25 percent and it lifted its reverse repo
rate, at which it borrows from banks, to 5.5 percent from 5.25
percent.
 Underlining its inflation concerns, the RBI's governor said
the central bank had considered a 50 basis point rise.
 Economists in a Reuters poll before the policy decision had
forecast the central bank would raise rates by 75 basis points
in 2011.
 India's food prices have been rising at double digit
pace for much of the past year and its headline inflation in
December rose to 8.43 percent from 7.48 percent in November.
 Mounting raw material costs squeezed quarterly earnings at
top Indian household and consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever
, sending its shares down more than 5 percent on Tuesday.
 ""As high food inflation persists, the prospect of it
spilling over to the general inflation process is rapidly
becoming a reality,"" RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in his
review.
 ""The balance of risk has tilted towards intensification of
inflation,"" he said as the RBI raised its inflation forecast for
the end of the fiscal year in March to 7 percent from 5.5
percent.
 It said demand pressures in the economy were also rising,
illustrated by strong bank credit and corporate sales. In
addition, wages were rising as a share of corporate costs.
 The rise in global food prices, which the United Nations
food agency says are at record highs, comes on top of domestic
supply problems that are raising the price of food in India,
including an inefficient farm sector and poor distribution
network.
 Talk of agriculture reforms in recent years has yielded
little action in the face of resistance from politicians
courting rural voters, and the government has instead relied on
stop-gap steps to fight food inflation such as imports, export
curbs, and anti-hoarding measures.
 ""Supply management has to be tackled, supply bottlenecks
have to be removed, and on the demand side, excess liquidity is
to be mopped up,"" said Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee.
 ""We shall have to deal with the supply management, and for
that steps are being made,"" he said, without giving specifics.
 
 BALANCING ACT
 Several government ministers have made clear they oppose
aggressive monetary tightening, fearful that any impact on
growth could erode their political support ahead of a series of
state elections that, if lost, could hurt the ruling coalition.
 The RBI is trying to balance the need to control inflation
threats and support growth of close to 9 percent.
 It said the current account deficit, which it projected at
3.5 percent of GDP this fiscal year, was unsustainable, and
called for a diversification of exports and cited a need for
longer-term capital inflows to help finance the gap.
 The combination of inflation, current account gap and the
government's large fiscal deficit ""contribute to an increase in
uncertainty about economic stability,"" it said.
 India's ruling Congress party is under pressure over rising
prices, as well as its handling of corruption scandals.
 The price of onions, the most widely used vegetable in
India, rose around 70 percent last year.
 ""Unless meaningful output enhancing measures are taken, the
risks of food inflation becoming entrenched loom large and
threaten both the sustainability of the current growth momentum
and the realisation of its benefits by a large number of
households,"" Subbarao said.
 Still, the RBI said it expected price pressures to begin
easing in the first quarter of the fiscal year starting April 1.

 By Praveen Menon
 DUBAI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - DP World, the world's
third-largest port operator, gave no clues on any new asset sale
plans as it reported a rise in container shipping volumes for
last year fuelled by growth in Asia, Australia and the Americas.
 DP World, one of the more profitable units of debt-laden
Dubai World [DBWLD.UL, in December had sold 75 percent of its
Australian port operations for $1.5 billion.
 This was aimed at cutting debt and focusing on emerging
markets.
 Asked in a conference call on Tuesday if he expected any
other sales this year, chief executive Mohammed Sharaf declined
to comment.
 Earlier this week, a senior executive said DP World was
under no pressure from the Dubai government to sell assets to
help repay debt.
 The company said it handled 49.6 million twenty-foot
equivalent container units (TEU) in 2010, up 14 percent.
 Fourth-quarter volumes rose 9 percent, part of a record
second-half performance.
 ""This excellent performance in the second half of the year
will lead to a stronger financial performance and we expect to
report full year financial results in line with expectations and
well ahead of the prior year,"" Sharaf said.
 Sharaf also said there was no change to DP World's plans to
list in London in the second quarter.
 The company said volume growth was fuelled by strong
performance in Australia, America and Asia Pacific regions as
well as the continuing return of volumes to the European region.
 DP World added new terminals in China and Peru which became
operational last year.
 Sharaf said he agreed with analysts that the there would be
7 percent growth in the industry in 2012.
 The chief financial officer Yuvraj Narayan said the company
did not need any further equity and would have $3.8 billion in
cash after closing the Australia deal.
 ""We don't look at the Australia deal as a sale,"" Sharaf said
in the conference call. ""We have brought in a strategic partner,
who will be bringing more value to the business. We will be
monetizing some of the assets we have... investing it in other
parts of the world.""

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro came off a two-month
high on Tuesday as the euro zone rescue fund's first offer of
debt went in line with expectations, while the pound dived after
figures showed a shock contraction for the economy last quarter.
 Speculation about potential interest rate increases in the
euro zone and Britain took a step back as the poor UK GDP data
prompted investors to focus on worries about growth rather than
inflation.
 ""The UK GDP may be a warning sign of what is to come in
Europe. Market participants may reassess the rate hike scenarios
which had led to a short squeeze,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 Expectations the European Central Bank would lift interest
rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve have underpinned the
single currency this month due to tough talk on inflation and
interest rates by ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet.
 By 1029 GMT, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.3606, easing
from a high of $1.3688 on trading platform EBS hit earlier.
Traders cited selling by macro funds, a German bank and Asian
central banks as players targeted stop-loss orders below
$1.3625, $1.3615 and $1.3600.
 Initial support was seen around $1.3585, a key trendline off
the January lows, traders said. 
 Traders said the euro would need to hold above $1.3570 -- a
50 percent retracement of its decline from November to early
this month -- on a sustained basis to extend its gains.
 Sterling tumbled after a surprise 0.5 percent contraction in
fourth quarter UK GDP due to adverse weather, compared with
economists' forecasts of a 0.5 percent gain.
 The pound fell around 1.4 percent against the dollar to a
session low of around $1.5770. The euro rose above 86 pence for
the first time in three weeks.
 ""However much (GDP) is due to the weather it still means the
Bank of England is going to be a lot more cautious now,"" said
George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank.
 The Swiss franc was a major beneficiary, rising sharply
against the euro and the pound. The euro fell 0.4 percent to
1.2886 francs due to position adjustments, with near term
support around 1.2670, the low hit on Jan. 18.
 
 DEBT AUCTIONS
 The order book for the European Financial Stability
Facility's inaugural debt issue closed with bids valued at 43
billion euros for the 5 billion euros of paper on offer, a
source at the EFSF said on Tuesday. 
 Separately, Spain sold 2.2 billion euros in Treasury bills.

 However, the euro failed to capitalise on the successful
auctions. ""Ultimately the auctions did not significantly change
the picture for the euro,"" one London-based trader said.
 The dollar index rose 0.3 percent to 78.30, coming off a
2-1/2 month low of 77.814 hit on Monday.
 The dollar was down slightly at 82.31 yen, unaffected after
the Bank of Japan kept its policy unchanged as expected.
 The Australian dollar eased versus the U.S. dollar as risk
appetite receded and on lower-than-expected Australian consumer
inflation data.

 By Christina Fincher and David Milliken
 LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Britain's economy suffered a
shock 0.5 percent contraction in the last three months of 2010,
with unusually poor winter weather accounting for only part of
its first shrinkage in five quarters.
 Construction and service sector output -- dominant parts of
the economy -- posted big quarterly falls and the Office for
National Statistics said even without the disruption from
Britain's coldest December in a century, the economy would have
struggled to register any growth at all.
 ""This is a horrendous figure. An absolute disaster for the
economy,"" said Daiwa economist Hetal Mehta.
 With UK inflation at 3.7 percent almost double the Bank of
England's target, Tuesday's shock figures raise the ugly spectre
of stagflation and leave the central bank with an acute policy
dilemma.
 Sterling tumbled by a cent against the dollar on the
figures, which showed Britain's economy was in trouble even
before the government starts to cut public spending in earnest
in 2011. 
 January's rise in VAT will only add to the headwinds,
suggesting there may be worse to come for the economy.
 Gilt prices and short sterling futures jumped as investors
dampened expectations that the BoE would opt for an early rise
in interest rates to tackle inflation that has consistently
exceeded its target for most of the last three years.
 Analysts' consensus forecast was for growth only to slow to
0.5 percent from 0.7 percent in the third quarter, though
uncertainty over the impact of December's snow disruption meant
the range of forecasts ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 percent.
 ""We have been of the opinion that the Bank of England should
not raise interest rates until the first quarter of next year,""
said Stuart Green, economist at HSBC. ""I think the data really
confirms the idea that, given the headwind the economy is
facing, that this monetary stimulus is still required.""
 
 NO TURNING BACK
 Although Tuesday's data is backward looking, economists said
it highlighted how vulnerable growth was to negative shocks --
something that will worry the government as it steps up its
five-year plan to slash Britain's budget deficit.
 Finance minister George Osborne insisted that the shrinking
economy was no reason to deviate from his programme of public
spending cuts.
 ""There is no question of changing a fiscal plan that has
established international credibility on the back of one very
cold month,"" he said.
 Separate ONS figures showed Britain's public sector net
borrowing rose from a year ago to its highest December reading
on record, though it fell from the all-time record reached in
November.
 Public sector net borrowing came in at 15.3 billion pounds
($24.47 billion) in December, below the 18.1 billion pounds
forecast but above December 2009's total of 14.3 billion pounds.

 * Demand nearly nine times the 5 billion euros on offer
 * Funds to be used to finance bail out of Ireland
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The European Financial
Stability Facility, the 440 billion euro fund being used to bail
out Ireland, launched its debut bond issue on Tuesday with
demand dwarfing the 5 billion euros on offer.
 The EFSF is AAA-rated and was always expected to attract
strong interest for the near 16 billion euros it is expected to
issue in 2011.
 A source at the EFSF said it closed the order book with
demand at 43 billion euros, nearly nine times the 5 billion
euros of paper on offer -- a sign of confidence in the facility
and by extension the euro zone as it seeks to get on top of its
debt crisis.
 ""High demand is likely to be interpreted as showing there is
confidence in this mechanism and, as a consequence, in the whole
euro system,"" said Michael Leister, a debt strategist at WestLB
in Dusseldorf.
 Investors in Asia are expected to have bid strongly for the
bonds, looking to add AAA-rated paper to their portfolios.
 ""It was always going to go well with the likes of the
Japanese and Chinese reserve fund managers -- and probably a
whole heap of others -- piling into it like there's no
tomorrow,"" said Marc Ostwald, strategist at Monument Securities.
 The bond was priced at mid-swaps +6 basis points, a source
at one of the lead managers said.
 The EFSF was set up in May 2010 after EU leaders agreed they
needed a multi-billion-euro facility to handle future debt
crises after Greece was forced into a bailout when it became
impossible to finance itself on international markets.
 Together with the 60-billion-euro European Financial
Stability Mechanism and 250 billion euros from the International
Monetary Fund, the EU has in theory a total of 750 billion euros
available to tackle any future bailouts after Ireland.
 However, because of cash buffers and other guarantees built
into the EFSF to ensure that it retains a AAA rating, its
effective lending capacity is estimated to be only 250 billion
euros, which restricts how many bailouts it could handle.
 Ireland received an 85 billion euro EU/IMF bailout in
November, with around 18 billion euros of that due to come from
the EFSF and 22.5 billion coming from the EFSM, a fund backed by
European Union member states and also AAA rated.
 Debt market analysts said the large order book for the EFSF
bonds showed just how much appetite there was among investors
for top-grade, AAA rated debt.
 ""Feedback we're getting from accounts is that they're
welcoming this new asset class,"" said WestLB's Leister.
 ""They will be less liquidity than German Bunds or French
paper but overall I expect them to have decent secondary market
liquidity,"" he said, referring to how the bonds are traded after
they are placed in the market.
 ""All the banks will want to rank highly in the dealer lists
and turnover lists for these issues given that there are further
transactions to come and they want to put themselves in a good
position to be involved in the next deal.""

 LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high

Germany's Siemens was the latest company that has beat earnings

 The figures will be bad news for the government which is due

 The figures highlight the dilemma facing the Bank of

 Growth is expected to slow even further in the first half of

 * U.S. tax cuts, emerging economies driving recovery
 * Inflation risk seen in emerging economies
 
 (Adds yuan comments, recasts)
 By Phumza Macanda and Ed Cropley
 JOHANNESBURG, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Europe needs to strengthen
its financial rescue fund to reduce the risk of renewed global
instability as U.S. tax cuts and buoyant emerging economies help
propel the recovery elsewhere, the IMF said on Tuesday.
 Rich nations should nurture their slower growth rates by
keeping monetary policy loose, while inflation pressures may
force a number of emerging economies to raise borrowing costs,
and global growth engine China should look to revalue its yuan
currency sooner rather than later, it said.
 In an updated World Economic Outlook, the International
Monetary Fund said the global economy would likely expand 4.4
percent this year, a touch higher than the 4.2 percent forecast
in October. It expects growth of 4.5 percent in 2012.
 But, in an update to its Global Financial Stability Report,
the Fund said the effective size of Europe's financial rescue
fund should be increased and that its banks needed rigorous
stress-testing to help restore market confidence.
 ""Problems in Greece, and now Ireland, have reignited
questions about sovereign debt sustainability and banking sector
health in a broader set of euro area countries and possibly
beyond,"" it said as it released the reports in Johannesburg.
 The worry is that the European Financial Stability Facility,
which has a headline value of 440 billion euros but an effective
lending capacity of around half that, could be wiped out if a
larger European economy needed rescuing.
 There have been EU discussions on beefing up the fund so it
can lend the full amount, but there has been resistance from
Germany, which says it must be part of a wider set of measures
expected in March.
 The IMF said Europe's banks needed further stress-testing --
as scheduled by the region's policymakers -- to ensure they
could withstand any future shock. Non-viable banks should be
closed, it said.
 The link between weak balance sheets of European banks and
governments was a primary reason why the International Monetary
Fund said global financial stability was still at risk nearly
four years after the financial crisis struck.
 
 LIFT TO RECOVERY
 The Fund forecast a lift to a global economic recovery which
began to gain pace in 2010 from a package of U.S. tax cuts
enacted late last year. It said a separate stimulus package in
Japan would also help.
 ""More generally, signs are increasing that private
consumption... is starting to gain a foothold in major advanced
economies,"" it said.
 Advanced economies have been a drag on global growth since
the financial crisis erupted and the IMF said they still posed
the biggest risk to recovery.
 It also kept pressure on Beijing to allow the yuan  to
strengthen, in contrast to French President Nicolas Sarkozy
saying on Monday it was not his job to tell China what to do
with its currency.
 ""Sooner or later it will be the logical thing, the necessary
thing, to appreciate,"" IMF head of research Olivier Blanchard
told a news conference. ""We think it could be done faster. We
think that the yuan is undervalued.""
 It raised its 2011 growth projection for advanced economies
to 2.5 percent, but warned the pace was not sufficient to make a
dent in high unemployment. It said rich nations needed to keep
loose monetary policies to bolster growth.
 ""As long as inflation expectations remain anchored and
unemployment stays higher, this is the right policy from a
domestic perspective,"" it said.
 The Fund forecast U.S. growth of 3.0 percent this year, a
sharp increase from 2.3 percent forecast in October for the
world's largest economy.
 It was less positive on other advanced economies -- keeping
its euro zone forecast at 1.5 percent and raising Japan slightly
to 1.6 percent -- but saw growth accelerating somewhat in 2012.
 Emerging and developing economies, which include China,
India, Brazil and Russia, were expected to keep up brisk growth,
although the Fund noted inflation pressures rising, particularly
from high food and energy prices.
 ""Many countries are close to potential,"" IMF head of
research Olivier Blanchard told a news conference. ""That
probably means that in a number of countries monetary policy may
need to be tightened in order to maintain inflation under
control.""
 It revised up its 2011 growth figure for emerging economies
to 6.5 percent and saw similar growth next year. For China, the
IMF maintained its 2011 growth forecast at 9.6 percent.
 The IMF said the surge in private investment flows into
emerging market economies would likely remain strong, buoyed by
low interest rates in mature markets. It cited inflation as the
key risk and said tighter monetary policies were needed.
 With emerging economies accounting for almost 40 percent of
global consumption, a slowdown in these economies ""would deal a
serious blow to the global recovery,"" the IMF warned.

 By Kevin Lim	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The Philippines is better
prepared to deal with inflation than some of the Southeast Asian
nation's neighbors that are also suffering from sudden capital
outflows, Fitch Ratings said in an interview on Tuesday.	
 Fears that some policymakers in Asia are falling behind in
a fight against higher prices have accelerated a shift in
allocations of foreign investors' portfolios, so far benefiting
Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan and hurting India, Indonesia
and Thailand.	
 The Philippines has been also swept up with the country's
bonds and shares being sold off. A bill auction on Monday failed
because Manila thought the rates demanded by investors were too
high, despite surging secondary market yields.	
 Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia Pacific sovereigns at Fitch,
is positive on the country, citing some favourable trends at
play that will help it weather price pressures.	
 ""Inflation dynamics remain pretty favourable and I think the
BSP (the Philippine central bank) is one of those with a better
track record of delivering appropriate policy,"" he told the
Dealing Room, a Reuters chat room, when asked about inflationary
concerns in Asia.	
 Colquhoun said in an interview that improved tax collection,
relatively strong economic growth and robust remittances from
overseas Filipinos were all helping the country's profile. 
 Fitch has a BB rating on the Philippines long-term foreign
currency debt with a stable outlook. 
 ""It is not a requirement for a watch positive to be issued
before an upgrade,"" Colquhoun said.	
 Moody's Investors Service rates the country's debt a notch
lower at Ba3, and earlier this month changed its outlook on the
Philippines to positive from stable. Standard & Poor's has the
country at BB.	
 The Philippine peso is the second-worst performing currency
in emerging Asia so far this month, just after the Indian rupee.
The peso has slid 1.4 percent against the dollar. The main stock
index has lost nearly 6 percent.	
 Among the countries that Colquhoun flagged as vulnerable to
sharp policy changes are Indonesia and to some extent India,
whose monetary tightening to date has seen little success in
pushing back inflation.	
 Moody's upgraded its sovereign debt rating on Indonesia to a
notch below high grade last week.	
 However, Tom Byrne, senior vice president and Asia regional
credit officer for Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters
Insider that Indonesia's spotty track record at handling bouts
of inflation were one of the reasons keeping it from achieving
investment-grade status. 
 ""We upgraded Indonesia but it's a Ba1 rating. It's not
investment grade range. One of the reasons for this is that in
the past, Indonesia hasn't had all that good monetary control or
inflation control ... it probably doesn't have as strong an
inflation targeting record as say the Philippines, or Australia
or New Zealand or even Korea or Taiwan,"" he said.	
 The Reserve Bank of India raised key rates by a quarter
percentage point on Tuesday as widely expected, its seventh
increase in the past year, and warned higher food prices could
become entrenched if steps to boost output are not taken.

 ""Any sign that Indian authorities were acquiescing in
double-digit inflation coupled with signs of that spilling over
into wages would be negative for that assessment, although not
necessarily enough to trigger rating action,"" Fitch's Colquhoun
said.

 * Bank lifts March 2011 inflation projection to 7 pct
 * Bond yields, swap rates ease after rate rise
(Adds details, comments, background)	
 By Suvashree Dey Choudhury and Tony Munroe	
 MUMBAI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - India's central bank raised
interest rates on Tuesday by 25 basis points, as expected, to
clamp down on resurgent inflation, warning higher food prices
could become entrenched if steps to boost output are not taken.	
 Even though the Reserve Bank of India has raised its policy
rates seven times since March, it said that the balance of risks
had tilted towards stronger inflation and it stood ready to
respond if price pressures increased.	
 The comments backed market views that the central bank would
need to raise rates again in coming months. Indeed, bond yields
and swap rates eased after the central bank decision because
some investors had expected a 50 basis point rate rise. 
 ""India has a serious inflation problem, something officials
have been highlighting recently. I suspect the market would have
been looking for a bolder move in terms of a 50 basis points
move,"" said Jonathan Cavenagh, senior FX strategist at Westpac
Institutional Bank in Singapore.	
 ""They need to show the market that they are prepared to get
ahead of the curve but a 50 basis points move may have prompted
fears of a pullback in growth,"" he said.	
 The RBI raised its repo rate , at which it lends
to banks, to 6.5 percent from 6.25 percent and it lifted its
reverse repo rate , at which it borrows from banks,
to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent.	
 Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast the central bank
would raise the rates by a quarter point on Tuesday and by 75
basis points during 2011. 
 
 The central bank is trying to balance the need to prevent
food prices, which the United Nations food agency says are at a
record high globally, from spreading to broader inflation while
keeping economic growth near 9 percent.	
 Several government ministers have made it clear they are not
in favour of aggressive tightening of monetary policy, fearful
than any impact on growth could hit their political support
ahead of a series of state elections that, if lost, could damage
the ruling coalition.	
 ""As high food inflation persists, the prospect of it
spilling over to the general inflation process is rapidly
becoming a reality,"" Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said in the policy document.	
 ""The balance of risk has tilted towards intensification of
inflation,"" he said.	
 
 BALANCING ACT	
 The yield on the most traded 8.13 bond maturing in 2022
eased to 8.17 percent after the announcement
before rebounding to 8.25 percent, a level it had held on to
before the review.	
 The 1-year OIS rate eased to 7.36 percent
from 7.42 percent before the central bank announcement. The
benchmark five-year swap fell to 7.98 percent
from 8.03 percent.	
 ""The RBI is trying to stem inflationary pressure, but at the
same time is being cautious that growth is not impacted. They
are following a gradual approach for rate hikes, so that
pressure is not felt suddenly,"" said Deven Choksey, managing
director at K R Choksey Shares & Securities in Mumbai.	
 ""The market is relieved, and seems to be taking a positive
view of this approach.""	
 India's ruling Congress party is under pressure over rising
prices for food and fuel, as well as its handling of corruption
scandals.	
 But, fearful of losing support among farmers and small
traders, it has balked at reforms to increase food supply and
productivity, such as allowing foreign investment in
supermarkets.	
 Food inflation has been in double digits for more than a
year, even before the current global pressures, and onion
prices, a key part of Indian food, have risen around 70 percent
over the last year. 
 The central bank joined a growing chorus for reforms to
agriculture.	
 ""Unless meaningful output enhancing measures are taken, the
risks of food inflation becoming entrenched loom large and
threaten both the sustainability of the current growth momentum
and the realisation of its benefits by a large number of
households,"" Subbarao said.	
 The wholesale price index , the most widely
watched inflation gauge in India, rose 8.43 percent in December
from a year earlier, compared with 7.48 percent in November.
 The RBI on Tuesday lifted its headline inflation projection
for March 2011 to 7 percent from 5.5 percent previously, and
said it expected inflation to begin moderating again in the
first quarter of the fiscal year that starts in April.	
 The RBI's perceived comfort zone for inflation is 5-6
percent in the short term and 3-4 percent in the medium term.	
 The central bank stuck with its 8.5 percent economic growth
forecast for the current fiscal year, but with an upside bias.

 * Aussie falls after CPI rises much less than expected
 * Rise in euro zone interest rates supports euro
 * Dollar further pressured by renewed risk appetite
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro held firm near a two-month
peak on Tuesday, showing only the barest signs of fatigue after a
rally in the past two weeks, as climbing euro zone interest rates
prompted speculators to bet on further gains in the currency.
 The Australian dollar fell broadly after lower-than-expected
consumer inflation data reinforced market expectations that
Australia's central bank will be in no hurry to lift interest
rates, though it cut much of its losses in late Asian trade.
 The single currency last traded at $1.3650, having
risen as high as $1.3685, just one pip off a two-month peak
marked in New York on Monday.
 The move brings into play the next major resistance level, at
$1.3742, a 61.8 percent retracement of the Nov-Jan fall, and then
the euro's Nov. 22 high of $1.3786.
 Underpinning the single currency were growing expectations
that the European Central Bank will lift interest rates ahead of
the U.S. Federal Reserve, after recent tough talk on keeping
inflation in check by ECB chief Jean Claude Trichet.
 In contrast, the Fed, more worried about creating jobs, is
set to keep a cautious view on U.S. economic recovery after its
policy-setting meeting on Wednesday.
 That helped to push the yield spread between two-year German
and U.S. bonds to its highest level in two years last Friday, at
0.67 percentage point. On Tuesday it remained near that peak,
standing at 0.65 percentage point.
 Given the euro/dollar's close historical relationship with
the yield spread, some analysts say the euro, which is still only
around a two-month high against the dollar, has more room to gain
in the near term.
 The common currency has been persistently supported by
robust demand from Asian central banks, which spurred buying
from real-money accounts and prompted the speculative market to
reverse bearish positions in an abrupt turnaround last week.
 Michael Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon, said market
flows remained supportive of the euro.
 ""More generally, investor optimism about euro zone
policymakers' determination to continue working toward
enhancing the European Financial Stability Facility and finding
a longer term resolution to the region's sovereign debt crisis
remains in place,"" he said.
 Some market players also said hopes of euro-demand from Asian
investors who want to buy EFSF's inaugural bonds due to be
launched later on Tuesday bolstered the currency.
 The euro was also helped by buying against the Australian
dollar, which came under broad selling pressure after Australian
consumer prices rose by far less than expected in the last
quarter.
 The euro climbed 0.2 percent against the Aussie to A$1.3700,
edging back towards a two-month high around $1.38 hit on Monday.
 The euro fetched 112.50 yen, flat on the day and near a
two-month high of 112.91 yen marked on Monday and handily above
its 200-day moving average, currently at around 112.20.
 Still, after a sharp gain in the past two weeks, which lifted
the euro some 6 percent on the dollar from $1.2860 on Jan. 10,
some analysts warn the rally might soon lose steam.
 ""The euro has rebounded after the debt auctions in Spain and
Portugal went well earlier in the month. But euro zone periphery
countries' growth outlook hasn't really improved,"" said Seiya
Nakajima, chief economist at Itochu Corp.
 STAYING SCEPTICAL
 Some market players also remained sceptical about the chance
of an ECB rate hike, thinking that concerns about highly
indebted peripheral euro zone countries could tie the central
bank's hands.
 Still, as the euro continued to recover, the dollar index
dangled near a 2-½ month low of 77.814 hit on Monday. It last
stood at 77.99, down slightly on the day.
 The greenback was further hit by renewed risk appetite as
Wall Street resumed its rally.
 ""With share prices in many developed countries near recent
highs, the market is generally positive about taking risks,"" said
a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Rising risk appetite helped to limit the fall in the Aussie
dollar against the dollar. The Aussie shed 0.1 percent to
$0.9950, but managed to stay above support at around $0.9920.
 Selling in Aussie/yen also pushed dollar/yen 0.1 percent
lower to 82.50 yen.
 The yen did not move after the Bank of Japan kept its policy
unchanged following its meeting that ended on Tuesday, as
expected.

should give a lift to a global economic recovery that had
already begun to gain speed late last year, the IMF said on
Tuesday as it revised its world growth forecast higher.
 In an updated World Economic Outlook report, the
International Monetary Fund said the global economy would
likely expand 4.4 percent this year, a touch higher than the
4.2 percent it forecast in October. It said it expected growth
of 4.5 percent in 2012.
 Tax cuts enacted late last year will likely lift growth in
the United States by half a percent this year, and a separate
stimulative package from Japan would also help sustain the
moderate global recovery, the IMF said.
 ""More generally, signs are increasing that private
consumption -- which fell sharply during the crisis -- is
starting to gain a foothold in major advanced economies,"" it
said.
 Advanced economies have been a drag on global growth since
the financial crisis erupted in 2007.
 While they are beginning to offer a bigger contribution,
the IMF said those economies still pose the biggest risk to the
world recovery. In particular, it warned of downside risks from
the debt crisis in Europe and the high debt levels in many
other advanced economies.
 It said ""comprehensive, rapid, and decisive policy actions""
were needed to tackle troubles in the euro zone. In a separate
report on Tuesday, the IMF called for an increase in the
effective size of Europe's financial rescue fund and rigorous
stress-testing of the region's banks.
 The Fund revised up its 2011 growth projection for advanced
economies to 2.5 percent from an October forecast of 2.2
percent. It said growth would likely remain at 2.5 percent next
year -- a pace it warned was not sufficient to make a dent in
high unemployment rates.
 The IMF said rich nations needed to keep in place loose
monetary policies to support growth. ""As long as inflation
expectations remain anchored and unemployment stays higher,
this is the right policy from a domestic perspective,"" it said.
 The Fund said the U.S. economy would likely grow 3.0
percent this year, a sharp upward revision from its 2.3 percent
October forecast. The IMF expects growth in the world's largest
economy to ease slightly to 2.7 percent in 2012.
 For Japan, the IMF said growth was now expected to reach
1.6 percent this year, an upward revision from October, and 1.8
percent next year.
 It maintained its October forecast for the euro zone at 1.5
percent and estimated growth would accelerate to 1.7 percent
next year. It upgraded its 2011 growth forecast for Germany to
2.2 percent from 2.0 percent due to stronger domestic demand.
 EMERGING MARKETS OUT FRONT
 The IMF said it expects emerging and developing economies,
which include China, India, Brazil and Russia, to keep up their
brisk pace of growth, although it noted that inflation
pressures were rising in these countries.
 It revised up its 2011 growth figure for emerging economies
to 6.5 percent from an October projection of 6.4 percent, and
said it sees similar growth next year.
 For China, the IMF maintained its 2011 growth forecast at
9.6 percent and said growth next year would slow slightly to
9.5 percent.
 The Fund revised up its 2011 forecast for Brazilian growth
to 4.5 percent versus a previous projection of 4.1 percent. It
said Brazil would likely grow 4.1 percent next year.
 The IMF said the surge in private investment flows into
emerging market economies would likely remain strong, buoyed by
low interest rates in mature markets and a strong investor
appetite.
 It cited inflation as the key risk for emerging economies,
and said tighter monetary policies were needed.
 ""If policymakers fall behind the curve in responding to
nascent overheating pressures and asset price bubbles,
macroeconomic policies in key emerging economies could be
setting the stage for boom-bust dynamics in real estate and
credit markets and, eventually, a hard landing in these
economies,"" the IMF cautioned.
 With emerging economies accounting for almost 40 percent of
global consumption, a slowdown in these economies ""would deal a
serious blow to the global recovery,"" the IMF warned.

confidence, the IMF said in a report released on Tuesday.
 The link between weak balance sheets of European banks and
governments was a primary reason why the International Monetary

four years after the financial crisis struck.
 In an update to its Global Financial Stability Report, the
IMF also cautioned emerging markets to be on the lookout for
asset price bubbles or excessive credit stemming from heavy
capital flows, spurred on in part by easy-money policies in
advanced economies.
 ""While progress has been made and most financial sectors
are on the mend, risks to global financial stability remain,""
the IMF wrote in the report released in Johannesburg.
 ""Problems in Greece, and now Ireland, have reignited
questions about sovereign debt sustainability and banking
sector health in a broader set of euro-area countries and
possibly beyond,"" it said.
 The Fund recommended the effective size of the European
Financial Stability Facility be increased and said it should
have a ""more flexible mandate"" to ensure access to funding.
 The European fund has a headline value of 440 billion euros
but an effective lending capacity estimated at just 225 billion
euros because of the need to secure a triple-A credit rating.
 The worry is that the fund could be wiped out if a larger
European economy needed rescuing, and if that happened the
fallout may not remain contained within Europe.
 The EU has discussed ways to beef up the fund, but there
been resistance -- particularly from Germany -- to increasing
the total value.
 The IMF also said the European Central Bank would need to
continue supplying liquidity to banks that need it, and keep
active its Securities Markets Programme for buying public and
private debt securities.
 Europe's banks required further ""rigorous and credible""
stress-testing to ensure they could withstand a shock, and
authorities should require that banks found to need more
capital obtain the funding within a set timeframe, the IMF
said. Non-viable banks should be closed, it said.
 In the United States, the IMF said it was important to move
ahead with an overhaul of the housing finance system, and said
government-sponsored enterprises -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
-- could either be privatized or converted to public utilities
with an explicit guarantee.
 ""The authorities should not delay efforts to create an
action plan for the future,"" the IMF said.
 For emerging markets, heavy capital flows posed a stability
risk, and the IMF said countries with undervalued exchange
rates should allow their currencies to rise to help offset
inflow pressures.
 ""So far, evidence of asset price bubbles and credit booms
is still isolated to a few countries in a few sectors, but
equity inflows and carry-trade activity are generally quite
strong and these flows have to be watched carefully,
particularly where leverage may be involved,"" the IMF said.

whose monetary tightening to date has seen little success in
pushing back inflation.	
 The Reserve Bank of India will meet to set policy on
Tuesday, and is widely expected to lift key rates by a quarter
percentage point, its seventh increase in the past year.	
 ""Any sign that Indian authorities were acquiescing in
double-digit inflation coupled with signs of that spilling over
into wages would be negative for that assessment, although not
necessarily enough to trigger rating action,"" he said.

 * Aussie falls after CPI rises much less than expected
 * Rise in euro zone interest rates supports euro
 * Dollar further pressured by renewed risk appetite
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The euro rose near a two-month peak
on Tuesday, showing only the barest signs of fatigue after a
rally in the past two weeks, as climbing euro zone interest rates
prompted speculators to bet on further gains in the currency.
 The Australian dollar fell broadly after lower-than-expected
consumer inflation data reinforced market expectations that
Australia's central bank will be in no hurry to lift interest
rates.
 The single currency last traded at $1.3665 , having
risen as high as $1.3685, just one pip off a two-month peak
marked in New York on Monday.
 The move brings into play the next major resistance level, at
$1.3742, a 61.8 percent retracement of the Nov-Jan fall, and then
the euro's Nov. 22 high of $1.3786.
 Underpinning the single currency were growing expectations
that the European Central Bank will lift interest rates ahead of
the U.S. Federal Reserve, after recent tough talk on keeping
inflation in check by ECB chief Jean Claude Trichet.
 In contrast, the Fed, more worried about creating jobs, is
set to keep a cautious view on U.S. economic recovery after its
policy-setting meeting on Wednesday.
 That helped to push the yield spread between two-year German
and U.S. bonds to its highest level in two years last Friday, at
0.67 percentage point. On Tuesday it remained near that peak,
standing at 0.65 percentage point.
 Given the euro/dollar's close historical relationship with
the yield spread, some analysts say the euro, which is still only
around a two-month high against the dollar, has more room to gain
in the near term.
 The common currency has been persistently supported by
robust demand from Asian central banks, which spurred buying
from real-money accounts and prompted the speculative market to
reverse bearish positions in an abrupt turnaround last week.
 Michael Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon, said market
flows remained supportive of the euro.
 ""More generally, investor optimism about euro zone
policymakers' determination to continue working toward
enhancing the European Financial Stability Facility and finding
a longer term resolution to the region's sovereign debt crisis
remains in place,"" he said.
 Some market players also said hopes of euro-demand from Asian
investors who want to buy EFSF's inaugural bonds due to be
launched later on Tuesday bolstered the currency.
 The euro was also helped by buying against the Australian
dollar, which came under broad selling pressure after Australian
consumer prices rose by far less than expected in the last
quarter. [ID:nL3E7CO1TP]
 The euro climbed 0.5 percent against the Aussie to A$1.3735
, edging back near a two-month high around $1.38 hit on
Monday.
 The euro also gained slightly on the Japanese yen to fetch
112.60 yen , near a two-month high of 112.91 yen marked
on Monday and handily above its 200-day moving average, currently
at 112.16.
 Still, after a sharp gain in the past two weeks, which lifted
the euro some 6 percent on the dollar from $1.2860 on Jan. 10,
some analysts warn the rally might soon lose steam.
 ""Markets are still keen to see if EUR can hold 1.36 on a
more sustained basis. Two year EU-US swap spreads back above
100bp, might help in that regard. Last time we saw such wide
spreads, EUR/USD was closer to 1.42,"" said David Watt,
strategist at RBC Dominion.
 Watt said there were lingering concerns about highly
indebted peripheral euro zone countries, with the market still
""prepared to pay an elevated premium for EUR/USD puts over
calls"".
 STAYING SCEPTICAL
 Some market players also remained sceptical about the chance
of an ECB rate hike, thinking that concerns about highly
indebted peripheral euro zone countries could tie the central
bank's hands.
 Still, as the euro continued to recover, the dollar index
<.DXY> <=USD> dangled near a 2-½ month low of 77.814 hit on
Monday. It last stood at 77.924, down 0.1 percent so far in Asia.
 The greenback was further hit by renewed risk appetite as
Wall Street resumed its rally.
 ""With share prices in many developed countries near recent
highs, the market is generally positive about taking risks,"" said
a trader at a Japanese bank.
 Rising risk appetite helped to limit the fall in the Aussie
dollar against the dollar. The Aussie shed 0.2 percent to $0.9950
, but managed to stay above support at around $0.9920.
 Selling in Aussie/yen also pushed dollar/yen 0.1 percent
lower to 82.44 yen .
 The yen did not move after the Bank of Japan kept its policy
unchanged following its policy meeting ending on Tuesday, as
expected.

 By Daniel Magnowski	
 SINGAPORE, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Tuesday,
with the Nikkei gaining more than 1 percent , on
optimism that companies will report strong earnings, while the
euro held near a two-month high.	
 The euro could get a further boost if the U.S. Federal
Reserve maintains a cautious view of the U.S. economic recovery
after a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 Markets are increasingly speculating that the European
Central Bank will lift interest rates ahead of the Fed, after
recent tough comments by ECB chief Jean Claude Trichet about the
need to keep inflation in check. 
 ""Optimism about euro zone policymakers' determination
to continue working toward enhancing the European Financial
Stability Facility and finding a longer term resolution to the
region's sovereign debt crisis remains in place,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon. 
 Japan's Nikkei average rose for a second straight
session, advancing 1.2 percent , lifted not only by
gains in New York and London overnight but by local optimism
ahead of major corporate earnings reports.	
 Exporters including Canon and Kyocera are
due to report this week, which could set the tone for earnings
season which will last until early February. Canon rose 0.7
percent on Tuesday, while Kyocera added 1.8 percent . 
 ""This isn't going to be a regular earnings season,"" said
Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities.	
 ""Stocks have risen a lot over the quarter and strong
earnings are at least partly priced in by investors, so they
will not only want to see the figures for the quarter but also
how those firms can sustain growth in the long run.""	
 The Bank of Japan, ending a two-day policy meeting, kept
monetary policy extremely loose as expected, and reviewed its
long-term forecasts.	
 The central bank upwardly revised its consumer price
forecast for the fiscal year beginning in April, reflecting the
impact of recent rises in commodity prices, while roughly
maintaining its economic growth forecasts.	
 The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan
rose 0.5 percent after recording its worst weekly
performance in almost two months last week. It is down 1 percent
for the month. 
 Shares of resource companies gained on a rise in industrial
metals prices, with the MSCI ex-Japan materials index up 0.8
percent.	
 Worries about mounting inflationary pressures have spooked
some investors into selling out of emerging Asian markets and
taking profits after strong rallies in 2010, but rather than
leaving the region completely investors are channelling money
towards countries seen as better placed to deal with price
pressures. 
 Indonesian bond yields have jumped and stocks have retreated
as investors cut their holdings, worried that the country, one
of the darlings of emerging market investors in recent years,
does not have a tight grip on inflation. 
 Investors in major emerging markets are also closely
watching India's battle against stubborn inflation, which has
been aggravated by surging global commodities prices and
domestic supply pressures . India's central bank as expected
raised key rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday, the seventh
increase in the past year.

 EURO CLINGS TO GAINS	
 The euro held near a two-month peak in Asian trade,
hovering around $1.37 and bringing into focus its next
resistance level of $1.3742.	
 The single currency, which has risen 6 percent in the past
two weeks, was supported by hopes for a lasting solution to the
debt crisis in the euro zone, and talk that the ECB may raise
interest rates.	
 Demand from Asian central banks has also spurred wider
buying in the common currency. .	
 The Australian dollar fell by around 0.3 percent on
weaker than expected consumer price data, strengthening
expectations that the central bank is likely to keep interest
rates unchanged for some time. 
 Positive sentiment across the broader economy knocked gold
lower, with the metal falling to a 10-week low as demand from
risk-averse investors waned.	
 Spot gold slipped to $1,332 per ounce, well
down from the record high of $1.430.95 it touched in December.	
 U.S. crude futures fell for the sixth day running,
shedding 33 cents to $87.54 per barrel, on
expectations that stockpiles in the U.S. were rising
.

raise its stake in Square Enix Holdings, believing the Japanese
game maker's shares are undervalued, a portfolio manger of the
Chicago-based asset manager said on Tuesday.
 Harris held 11.43 percent of Square Enix as of Jan. 6,
according to the latest regulatory filing, making it the
second-largest shareholder after the game developer's honorary
chairman, Yasuhiro Fukushima.
 The filing shows Harris actively boosted its holdings in
Square Enix, known for its ""Dragon Quest"" and ""Final Fantasy""
games, in the wake of a profit warning on Dec. 16 that triggered
a sharp slide in the stock price.
 Rob Taylor, co-manager of two international funds with a
combined $9.3 billion in assets, told Reuters that lifting the
firm's stake was a possibility, saying the stock looked
undervalued trading at about three times its operating profit.
 ""The shares are so cheap right now,"" said Taylor in a phone
interview. ""There is nothing that would stop us from increasing
our holdings.""
 Harris Associates holds sizeable stakes in several Japanese
firms, including brokerage Daiwa Securities Group, automaker
Toyota Motor Corp, specialty chip maker Rohm Co and components
firm Hirose Electric Co.

 * Sovereign debt default a major talking point

 By Natsuko Waki
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 25 (Reuters) - World leaders and top
executives have plenty of crises to discuss this year.
 Ballooning European government debt, rising inflation, fears
of trade and currency wars, spiralling food prices and lingering
problems in the world financial system provide a sobering array
of threats for people attending the World Economic Forum (WEF).
 More than 30 heads of state, over 1,400 business leaders and
eight central bank chiefs will flock to Davos, an expensive
Swiss ski resort, for the Forum which opens on Wednesday.
 The WEF named the risk that parlous government finances will
trigger sovereign debt defaults as one of the biggest threats
facing the world in 2011 in a report published before the
meeting.
 Klaus Schwab, who chairs the Forum, said nations were
suffering from ""global burnout syndrome"" and were too weak to
tackle the plethora of inter-related threats facing business and
governments.
 To help to address the problem, the WEF will launch at this
year's Forum a global network designed to help policymakers and
corporate chiefs to share information about potential risks.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, chairman of the Group of
20 top developed and developing nations (G20), will focus in a
speech on Thursday on his key G20 agenda -- new rules to curb
commodity price volatility and avoid food riots and weak growth.
 Rising prices for food, fuel and metals have raised concerns
about inflation globally. They could also lead to protectionism
and the kind of unrest seen in Tunisia and Algeria in recent
weeks.
 High food prices could also hit consumer spending in
fast-growing emerging markets and endanger the fragile recovery
in the world economy.
 ""If we don't do anything (about rising food prices) we run
the risk of food riots in the poorest countries and a very
unfavourable effect on global economic growth,"" Sarkozy said on
Monday.
 Glitz and hype surround the Davos meeting, sometimes billed
""the world's top networking event"", though organisers say that
it does not set out to solve all the problems it discusses.
 As always, much of the real business is done on the
sidelines of the event, where policymakers and CEOs cut deals
away from the glare of publicity in luxury hotel rooms.
 Sarkozy may use this year's Davos meeting to discuss
informally with German Chancellor Angela Merkel options for
beefing up the euro zone's crisis-fighting mechanism, the
European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF).
 Analysts believe that sooner or later, some European
governments will restructure their debts and impose losses on
creditors, forcing more aid for banks exposed to such debts.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou could join euro zone
talks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will also be in
Davos on Friday.
 From emerging economies, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
makes an opening speech on Wednesday -- though the Kremlin said
earlier plans for him to meet Swiss leaders were cancelled after
a suicide bomber killed 35 on Monday at a Moscow airport.
 Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming is the highest ranking
official from the country's government who is in Davos.
 Michala Marcussen, head of global economics at French bank
Societe Generale, says Davos provides a platform for European
leaders to explain the region's debt situation to the rest of
the world.
 ""What makes Davos unique is the mixing of business leaders
and policymakers. Davos will be one of the opportunities for
European policymakers to know how the rest of the world sees and
understands the European situation,"" she said.
 European finance ministers discussing ways to raise the
lending capacity of their rescue fund reached no conclusion at a
meeting last week.
 Financial markets are worried that the continent's leaders
are taking too long to come up with convincing, long-term
solutions to the weight of debt which is crushing weaker euro
zone economies such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
 The EFSF, set up in May to provide financing, can borrow
money on the market with euro zone government guarantees of up
to 440 billion euros -- insufficient if both Portugal and Spain
apply for emergency financing. 
 Germany is key to any changes to the euro zone agreement but
has so far resisted calls to increase the size of the fund.
 ""We are shifting towards a new economic governance model, a
process driven by Germany. It will be done step by step,""
Marcussen says.

 * Youth particularly hit, many dropping out of labour mkt
 * Unemployment seen at 6.1 pct in '11 vs 6.2 pct in '10
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A faltering and uneven increase
in jobs is holding back the overall economic recovery and
unemployment is likely to continue at near record levels this
year, the International Labour Organisation said on Tuesday.
 Weak job creation is particularly devastating for young
people, and official figures understate the true number of
unemployed as many people have given up looking for work, the
United Nations jobs agency said.
The ILO released the bleak report on the eve of the annual
meeting in Davos of business and political leaders, who are
confronted this year by growing economic disparity between and
within countries, and an apparent inability of the international
community to deal with the problem.
Presenting the ILO's ""Global Employment Trends 2011,
executive director Jose Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs said the
recovery in economic growth will lose momentum this year.
 ""This is partly because of the deflationary effects of the
dire state of labour markets,"" he told a news conference.
 Unemployment, insecurity about jobs and cuts in social
benefits are depressing consumption, a key element in domestic
demand, preventing a self-sustaining recovery from taking hold,
he said.
 Unemployment rates in some developing economies such as
Brazil have fallen below levels before the global crisis but
continue to rise in many countries.
 The ILO expects the total number of unemployed to edge down
to 203.3 million this year, a jobless rate of 6.1 percent, from
205 million or 6.2 percent in 2010.
 The total number of unemployed rose by 27.6 million between
2007 and 2010 in the crisis and its aftermath, it estimates.
""2011 will most likely be the third consecutive year with global
unemployment above 200 million people,"" Salazar-Xirinachs said.
 
 DISCOURAGED WORKERS
 The slight improvement in the jobless figures masks the fact
that millions of people have dropped out of the labour force in
despair at ever finding work, ILO experts say.
 The ILO does not have a figure for these people, who would
boost the true unemployment rate significantly. But it estimates
on the basis of data from 56 countries that 1.7 million fewer
people aged 15-24 have joined the labour force than would have
been expected on the basis of pre-crisis trends.
 Young workers have been particularly badly hit, with an
unemployment rate of 12.6 percent in 2010 against 4.8 percent
for adults, the ILO said. This is expected to tick down to 12.3
percent this year but the figure is a global average, masking
rates of 30-40 percent in some countries.
 Youth unemployment rates in 2010 of 18.2 percent in
developed countries including the European Union, 23.6 percent
in North Africa and 25.1 percent in the Middle East pose a
challenge to policymakers keen to prevent the weak economy
provoking social unrest.
 ""Clearly young people have been very badly hit by the
recession and the weak recovery does not bode well for job
opportunities for them,"" Salazar-Xirinachs said.
 While developed nations account for 15.7 million of the 27.6
million rise in unemployment, many offer social safety nets
unavailable in poor countries, where the number of working poor
earning less than $1.25 a day or in jobs that are vulnerable is
growing.
 Salazar-Xirinachs said governments should maintain fiscal
programmes that support employment or private-sector investment,
and avoid measures to reduce budget deficits in the short term
that weaken job creation and undermine the recovery.
 Large emerging economies that have relied on exports for
growth should rebalance by boosting domestic consumption, for
instance through better social benefits or higher wages, he
said.

 By Walter Brandimarte and Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro hit a fresh
two-month high on Monday as hopes for a durable solution to
the euro-zone debt crisis pushed the currency past key
technical levels, while stocks rose on bets of higher growth
in the global economy.
 Prices of copper and other metals rose as the optimism
about growth triggered worries about supply constraints,
driving up shares of miners and natural resources companies.
 Asian shares headed to a positive start, with Nikkei
futures traded in Chicago  up 0.9 percent at 10,415.00.
 Speculation that the European Central Bank might raise
interest rates also provided support for the euro ,
pushing it as high as $1.3683 on trading platform EBS, a fresh
two-month high against the dollar. It last traded up 0.21
percent at $1.3644.
 ""They are closer to tightening in the euro zone with a lot
less spare capacity, and it is realistic to expect the ECB to
tighten before the Federal Reserve,"" said Kathy Lien, director
of research at GFT Forex in New York.
 Expectations of higher rates in Europe grew after ECB
chief Jean-Claude Trichet sounded tougher on inflation. For
details, see [ID:nLDE70M0GT].
 The European single currency has gained nearly 6 percent
from this year's low as investors grew more confident about
the euro zone's economic prospects.
 Some analysts feared, however, that the rally was close to
an end as political turmoil in Ireland was a reminder of the
uncertainties plaguing the most indebted European countries.
[ID:nLDE70N19X]
 ""The euro's had a sharp rebound recently, but we think
it's nearing its top in the bigger picture,"" said Ian
Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""It's supported in the near-term by optimism over talks on
the European rescue fund, but political problems in Ireland
and Portugal show there are still lots of factors out there to
hurt the currency,"" he added.
 The U.S. dollar slipped 0.23 percent against a basket of
major currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>.
Against the Japanese yen , it fell 0.15 percent to
82.46.
 STOCKS EXTEND GAINS
 Global equities advanced as U.S. stocks found strength in
large-cap technology and natural resources shares, which were
lifted by bets on global growth prospects and Intel's gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> extended its rally
after eight weeks of gains, rising 108.68 points, or 0.92
percent, to end at 11,980.52. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> advanced 7.49 points, or 0.58 percent, to close at
1,290.84, while the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 28.01
points, or 1.04 percent, to 2,717.55.
 The blue-chip Dow average came close to touching the
psychologically important 12,000 level, with its climb
intraday to a fresh 52-week high at 11,982.94.
 Intel Corp  raised its dividend by 15 percent and
authorized another $10 billion for stock repurchases, putting
the spotlight on larger tech companies with slower growth.
Intel's stock closed up 2 percent at $21.24 and buoyed the
major U.S. stock indexes.
 Climbing copper prices and tin prices rising to all-time
highs reflected concerns over supply constraints and buoyed
materials companies' stocks. [ID:nLDE70N0TF]
 ""It's very difficult to ignore the positive implications
for earnings in material stocks when the global economy is
gaining traction,"" said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of the
GAMCO Growth Fund in Rye, New York.
 World shares as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.64 percent, while the
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares added
0.25 percent to close at 1,151.18, supported by gains in
mining stocks.
 U.S. crude oil prices  dropped $1.24, or 1.39
percent, to settle at $87.87 per barrel in choppy trading,
even as heating oil futures were lifted by U.S. cold weather.
 Still weighing on oil prices was last week's U.S. data
showing an increase in oil inventories against forecasts for
lower stockpiles.
 Investors also were cautious before the U.S. Federal
Reserve's first monetary policy meeting this year on Tuesday
and Wednesday.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries were virtually unchanged as
traders awaited an upcoming supply of debt and the outcome of
the Fed's meeting. The benchmark 10-year note  was
up 1/32 in price, with the yield at 3.406 percent.
 The Fed is expected to buy $29 billion in U.S. debt,
buying Treasuries on four of five trading days this week. It
will also issue a policy statement on Wednesday after its
meeting -- its first meeting of the year.

 * Colombian vice president in Washington for talks
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama faced
bipartisan pressure on Monday to send Congress long-delayed
trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama and rally
support for them.
 ""We need to get back on track by opening markets to U.S.
products,"" Senator Rob Portman told Reuters ahead of Obama's
annual State of the Union speech to Congress on Tuesday. ""I
think it's a critical part of the overall package to deal with
this stubbornly high unemployment.""
 Obama used the State of the Union speech last year to set a
goal of doubling exports in five years. He also called for
closer trade ties with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.
 This year, ""I hope he will take the next step and say I'm
now going to send these trade agreements forward"" to Congress
for a vote, Portman said.
 Portman, who was elected to the Senate in November,
launched negotiations on the South Korea trade agreement back
in 2006, when he was chief U.S. trade negotiator under former
President George W. Bush.
 The Ohio Republican said he was working with Senator Joe
Lieberman, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, on a
sense of the Congress resolution urging passage of all three of
the delayed trade deals.
 On Tuesday, Obama is widely expected to say he plans to
submit the Korea agreement to Congress for a vote, following
recent changes his administration negotiated to the pact to
address U.S. auto industry concerns.
 It's unclear what Obama will do about the Colombia and
Panama free trade agreements, which were negotiated by the Bush
administration and opposed by many House Democrats.
 In an opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal on
Monday, a pair of Democrats who served in President Bill
Clinton's White House urged Obama to push for bipartisan
approval of all three trade deals.
 ""A full throated-campaign for the Korea, Colombia and
Panama trade agreements, along with WTO (World Trade
Organization) for Russia, can help reset this presidency,""
Thomas ""Mack"" McLarty and Nelson Cunningham said.
 McLarty was Clinton's chief of staff from 1993-1994 and
Cunningham was an aide to Clinton and Senator Joe Biden before
Biden became vice president.
 Colombia is the most controversial of the two Latin America
agreements because of that country's history of violence
against labor union members.
 Supporters of the pact argue that violence was greatly
reduced under President Alvaro Uribe, who left office last
year.
 Colombian Vice President Angelino Garzon, a former union
leader, is in Washington this week to meet with U.S. lawmakers
and Obama administration officials about the pact.
 The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on
Tuesday on all three agreements, in a sign of Republican
interest in advancing the pacts.
 Meanwhile, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus
said he was would travel to Colombia in February to discuss
issues that held up approval of the agreement.
 ""We have delayed action on the Colombia Free Trade
Agreement for too long. Now is the time to resolve outstanding
issues and approve the Free Trade Agreement so American
ranchers, farmers and workers can have a chance to compete,""
Baucus said.

 NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
near $1.37 on Monday but lost some momentum in New York trade
as worries about Europe's debt crisis and the speed of the
euro's recent rally provoked some euro longs to book profits.

 Still, the euro rose for a fifth straight session, trading
up 0.2 percent at $1.3644  late in New York. But it
was off a two-month high of $1.3683, and some analysts said it
could retreat several cents per dollar in the weeks ahead.
 ""The euro has come so far, so quickly, and all in the
absence of a real solution to the euro zone's debt problem.

said Brendan McGrath, senior analyst at Wester Union Business

 ""You're running into a lot of selling interest above

 In other trading, the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 82.48 yen
 and the euro added 0.1 percent to 112.51 . The
dollar was also down 1 percent at 0.9484 Swiss francs .
 EURO GAINS NEARING A TOP?
 The euro has rallied some 6 percent in the past two weeks,
aided by increasing international support for the euro zone's
debt rescue plan and concerns that higher inflation will prompt
a rate rise this year. European Central Bank President

 The euro retained a key technical level around $1.3570, a
50 percent retracement of its decline from November to early
January. Technical analysts say it must hold above that level
on a sustained basis to extend its gains.
 Other traders said it was too early to call an end to the
euro's rally. Forex.com chief strategist Brian Dolan said the
currency's ability to hold above $1.3625, the top of a closely
watched Japanese indicator, the Ichimoku cloud, was a bullish
sign.
 Another jump would target $1.3695, then $1.3740, the 61.8
percent retracement of the November-to-January decline, traders
said.

 * Ties still at ""political low"" over Nobel Peace Prize
 
 By Alister Doyle
 TROMSOE, Norway, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Norway reiterated
support on Monday for China to have an observer role in Arctic
affairs despite a slump in relations since the award of the 2010
Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident.
 Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said Oslo's relations
with Beijing would take time to recover after the Norwegian
Nobel Committee awarded the prize in October to Liu Xiaobo,
serving an 11-year sentence in China for subversion.
 At a conference on ""Arctic Frontiers"" in northern Norway, he
told Reuters Oslo favoured granting China an observer role at
meetings of the Arctic Council, which groups the United States,
Russia, Canada and the five Nordic countries.
 He said the melting of Arctic sea ice, linked to global
warming, was generating interest from China and other Asian
countries in future opportunities including a shipping route
between the Pacific and the Atlantic.
 ""Every regional dimension that is linked to transport has a
global impact,"" he said. ""We need to find the right channels ...
to talk, to cooperate with China. Norway favours China being an
observer of the Arctic Council.""
 The European Commission is also interested in becoming a
full-time observer at the Council. Russia has been among
countries reluctant to let in observers.
 Angered by the award of the Nobel Prize to Liu, Beijing has
indefinitely postponed the next round of talks with Oslo on a
bilateral trade deal which Norway has long hoped could be a
model for other European countries.
 
 POLITICAL LOW
 ""We are still at a political low. We are not pushing agendas
at the moment, we have to take note of China's reaction,"" Stoere
said. ""A lot of economic activity is going on, a lot of trade"",
between the two despite the deadlock, he said.
 Stoere said Oslo had stressed to Beijing that the
five-member Nobel Committee, whose chairman is a former Prime
Minister, was appointed by Norway's parliament to act
independently of the government.
 ""We take note of China making the link between Norway and
this decision. We have made our point clear on that. And then we
need to take time,"" he said. He did not spell out how long he
expected the standoff to last.
 On Jan. 11, Norway's Trade Minister Trond Giske said the
government had ""the ambition to land the trade deal during
2011""..
 Norwegian exports to China fell by 10.1 percent in 2010 to
13.5 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.32 billion) while imports rose
by 17.4 percent to 37.6 billion, Norway's statistics agency said
last week.

 * Fiscal, financial strains, food prices may cause problems
 
 (Adds quotes)
 By John Irish 
 PARIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund
expects global economic growth in 2011 to be just slightly
slower than last year's rate of 4.75 percent, its deputy
managing director said on Monday.
""The fund's report to be released tomorrow... (I can
confirm) 2011 global growth is expected to be only slight slower
than 4.75 (percent) last year,"" IMF First Deputy Managing
Director John Lipsky, said at the OECD's Latin American Forum in
Paris.
 Lipsky said the growth was ""impressive"" given the 10-20 year
averages for global growth were about 3.5 percent, but said that
much of the growth was due to emerging markets.
 ""Emerging economies have represented the driving force of
the post-crisis global expansion: strong domestic demand --
buoyed by an accommodative policy stance and renewed inflows of
foreign capital -- has powered a very robust recovery, even
providing some boost to advanced economies,"" he said. 
 However, he warned that despite the pace of growth, future
economic expansion faced three downside risks.
 ""The links between financial stresses and fiscal
sustainability --especially in the euro area -- have the
potential to undermine growth,"" he said. 
 ""The lack of progress in formulating credible medium-term
fiscal consolidation plans in many advanced economies, that
could weaken confidence and push up long-term interest rates;
and high commodity and food prices, that could undermine
macroeconomic stability and trigger social and political strains
in developing countries.""
 Lipsky said advanced economies did not have much policy room
to manoeuvre to secure faster growth via shifts in domestic
macroeconomic policies. 
 ""Other countries (excluding U.S.) either have no room for
further fiscal expansion, or they are being pushed by financial
market pressures to tighten budget policies immediately. In this
context, accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies
so far have been welcome and appropriate,"" he said.
 When asked by reporters on price pressures Lipsky said he
was concerned that there were countries where headline inflation
had moved above targets.
 ""It (has) to be watched closely to avoid deterioration in
core inflation and inflationary expectations,"" he said.

 By Walter Brandimarte and Alina Selyukh
 NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro hit a fresh
two-month high on Monday as hopes for a durable solution for
the euro-zone debt crisis pushed the currency past key
technical levels, while stocks rose on bets of higher growth
in the global economy.
 Prices of copper and other metals rose as the optimism
about growth triggered worries about supply constraints,
driving up shares of miners and natural resources companies.
 The euro  ran as high as $1.3660 on trading
platform EBS, a fresh two-month high against the dollar. It
last traded up 0.27 percent at $1.365.
 The European single currency has gained nearly 6 percent
from this year's low on hopes the euro zone is on track to
find a durable solution to its debt crisis.
 Speculation that the European Central Bank might raise
interest rates also provided support for the euro. For
details, see [ID:nLDE70M0GT].
 Some analysts feared, however, that the rally was close to
an end as political turmoil in Ireland was a reminder of the
uncertainties plaguing the most indebted European countries.
[ID:nLDE70N19X]
 ""The euro's had a sharp rebound recently, but we think
it's nearing its top in the bigger picture,"" said Ian
Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""It's supported in the near-term by optimism over talks on
the European rescue fund, but political problems in Ireland
and Portugal show there are still lots of factors out there to
hurt the currency,"" he added.
 The U.S. dollar slipped 0.31 percent against a basket of
major currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>.
Against the Japanese yen , it fell 0.16 percent to
82.45.
 STOCKS EXTEND GAINS
 Global equities advanced as U.S. stocks found strength in
large-cap technology and natural resources shares, which were
lifted by bets on global growth prospects and Intel's gains.
 World shares as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.6 percent, while the FTSEurofirst
300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares added 0.3 percent to
close at 1,151.18, supported by gains in mining stocks.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> extended its rally
after eight weeks of gains, rising 87 points, or 0.73 percent,
to 11,958.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained

Composite Index <.IXIC> added 25.87 points, or almost 1
percent, to 2,715.41.
 Intel Corp  raised its dividend by 15 percent and
authorized another $10 billion for stock repurchases, putting
the spotlight on larger tech companies with slower growth.
Intel's stock was up 1.61 percent at $21.16 and buoyed the
major U.S. stock indexes.
 Climbing copper prices and tin prices rising to all-time
highs reflected concerns over supply constraints and buoyed
materials companies' stocks. [ID:nLDE70N0TF]
 ""It's very difficult to ignore the positive implications
for earnings in material stocks when the global economy is
gaining traction,"" said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of the
GAMCO Growth Fund in Rye, New York.
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell $1.38, or 1.55 percent,
to $87.73 per barrel in choppy trading, even as heating oil
futures were lifted by U.S. cold weather.
 Still weighing on oil prices was last week's U.S. data
showing an increase in oil inventories against forecasts for
lower stockpiles.
 Investors also were cautious before the U.S. Federal
Reserve's first monetary policy meeting this year on Tuesday
and Wednesday.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries were flat to slightly higher as
traders made adjustments in advance of upcoming supply and the
Fed's meeting. The benchmark 10-year note  was up
5/32 in price, with the yield at 3.389 percent.
 The Fed is expected to buy $29 billion in U.S. debt,
buying Treasuries on four of five trading days this week. It
will also issue a policy statement on Wednesday after its
meeting.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2011 12:24PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Euro zone eyes more nimble approach to crisis," * Policymakers look to get ahead of the market in crisis
 * Bond buy-backs, syndication possible future steps
 * Measures part of short-term efforts on debt crisis
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - By adopting a more nuanced
approach to their debt crisis, euro zone leaders may be on the
verge of stemming the contagion that only weeks ago seemed set
to overwhelm the bloc by enveloping Portugal and its larger
neighbour Spain.
 Throughout the latter half of 2010, the bloc's only real
answer to the crisis was the 750 billion euro ($1,017 billion)
rescue facility it cobbled together under acute duress following
its shock bailout of Greece in May.
 The facility's big headline number -- a combination of EU
and IMF funds including the bloc's 440 billion euro European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) -- restored calm at first,
but markets soon began to view it as a last-resort bazooka and
set out to test it and the resolve of the leaders who set it up.
 It has taken the politicians and technocrats many harrowing
months to realise the flaws of their initial strategy. In
response they are now edging towards a more nimble, flexible and
broad-based approach for handling a crisis which some experts
still believe could doom the single currency experiment or force
out a member.
 ""We need to get ahead of the crisis and be able to respond
to it more subtlely,"" said a senior euro zone official directly
involved in structuring the EU's crisis response.
 ""We don't like this situation where the market is able to
drive a country across some red line and then we're in crisis
mode and have to arrange an 80 or 90 billion euro bailout when
it's almost too late, when a much smaller amount of money
earlier might have helped control the situation,"" she said.
 In discussions that have taken place at meetings of euro
zone finance ministers over the past two months, and among
economic and finance officials at frequent gatherings, the focus
has been on how to deploy the EFSF more cleverly, to enhance it
as European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet says both
""quantitatively and qualitatively"".
 The quantitative approach has involved looking at how the
effective lending capacity of the EFSF, which is limited by cash
buffers and other guarantees, can be raised from around 250
billion euros currently to its full ceiling of 440 billion. 
 There is also discussion about raising the overall size of
the fund and possibly doubling it, although Germany, as the
largest provider, remains reluctant.
 But it is the qualitative approach that is revealing most
about how policymakers are trying to be more creative in
tackling a crisis that has rumbled on for nearly a year.
 
 EYES ON MARCH
 No specific decisions have yet been taken -- and may not be
until EU leaders meet to discuss next steps at a summit on March
24-25 -- but trial balloons and proposals are being released
that suggest some of the tactics under consideration.
 Officials have mooted the possibility of the EFSF being used
to buy bonds directly in the secondary market, or to make loans
to troubled countries to allow them to buy their own bonds. Both
moves could help bring down bond yields and lighten the burden
on sovereign debt markets while increasing confidence.
 There are also efforts to diversify funding, with countries
such as Portugal, Greece and Spain looking to make private
placements of debt, or sell bonds through syndication.
 Market concerns about troubled banking sectors are also
being addressed. Last week Spain announced plans for a partial
state takeover of its weakest savings banks, winning plaudits
from investors and ratings agency Moody's..
 Euro zone countries have also sought help from their foreign
partners. China has publicly promised to buy government debt
from Greece and Spain. Japan and Russia are also mentioned as
possible buyers of euro zone sovereign bonds.
 Whether it is the result of this more nuanced approach or
more market-driven factors, such as a broader shift in the focus
of hedge funds away from the euro zone's woes, investors appear
to be coming around.
 Yields on peripheral euro zone debt have fallen in recent
days and the cost of protecting lower-rated euro zone sovereign
debt against default has dipped sharply in the past two weeks.
 ""There are growing expectations that the European
authorities will announce a more substantive fiscal policy by
the March summit meetings,"" Nick Stamenkovic, a debt strategist
at RIA Capital Markets, said on Monday in explaining the more
positive tone in European markets.
 Analysts who have closely followed the debt crisis over the
past year believe policymakers are having more success at
getting ahead of the market, and believe Germany has adopted a
more pragmatic approach that has helped settle agitation.
 ""The fact that there is more calm on the markets is from the
EU and euro zone perspective a good thing,"" Janis Emmanouilidis,
a senior analyst at European Policy Centre, told Reuters.
 ""If in a few weeks' time, at the March summit, they can come
up with some concrete proposals (on the EFSF), that could be the
positive blow that gets them ahead of the markets,"" he said.
 But he and others caution that this is just the short-term
approach. The fundamental issue underpinning the crisis is the
need to restructure the economies of weaker euro zone countries,
making them more competitive, raising growth, tackling
unemployment and reining in excessive spending.
 That is a multi-year process that is part of the EU's
efforts to strengthen the stability and growth pact. In the
short-term, what is required is a nimble strategy that allows
the euro zone to pre-empt problems before they begin.
 ""We know what we need to do and where there are problems,""
said the senior euro zone source. ""But part of the issue is
getting sovereign countries to adopt the strategy, getting them
to preempt the problem and react before it blows up.""

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2011 12:11PM ET</span>",Greece should restructure debt now-Bruegel think-tank," * Influential think tank says Greek restructuring inevitable
 * Costs of restructuring get heavier if delayed
 * Think-tank's research often reflected in euro zone policy

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Greece's debt burden is so
large that Athens will not be able to service it without a
restructuring and the sooner that happens, the smaller the loss
for investors would be, researchers from the influential Bruegel
think-tank said.
 The European Commission forecast last November that Greek
public debt will rise to 150.2 percent of gross domestic product
from 140.2 percent in 2010 and then to 156 percent in 2012.
 ""We think that Greek debt is unsustainable and should be
restructured and it is better if it happens now than later,""
said Bruegel's Zsolt Darvas, who is preparing the research
together with Bruegel members Jean Pisani-Ferry and Andre Sapir.
 Bruegel research is often reflected in the decisions of euro
zone policy-makers.
 Darvas said that assuming that Greek debt should be reduced
to 90 percent of GDP, the haircut in the value of bonds held
privately and by the ECB would be 40 percent this year.
 If policymakers wait until 2013, the haircut would have to
grow to 60 percent, because the debt would grow, Darvas said.
 The restructuring would be needed because only to stabilise
Greek debt at current levels, Athens would have to have a
primary budget surplus of 8.6 percent of GDP, rather than the
1.2 percent of GDP primary deficit forecast by the European
Commission for 2011.
 To bring debt down, the primary surplus would have to be
even higher, by some 5 percentage points.
 ""This is too much,"" Darvas said.
 The final version of the paper is to be published next
week, ahead of the Feb. 4 meeting of EU leaders, Darvas said.
 The Commission has said the summit should make decisions on
increasing the size and scope of operations of the euro zone
rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
 Greece has repeatedly denied it was planning any debt
restructuring and the Commission has said no talks on such a
scenario were going on because its consequences were too
dangerous in terms of spill over effects.
 But Darvas said that because market participants have made
their own calculations and expected a Greek default, the
consequences would not be that severe.
 ""It would not be a European Lehman Brothers,"" Darvas said,
referring to the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank that
triggered a sharp deterioration in the global financial crisis
which started in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market.

debt problems while stocks rose as investors tried to revive a
rally that had pushed world equities to August 2008 levels.
 Oil prices fell more than $1 a barrel as inventories rose
and investors looked to the stock market for direction.
Investors also were cautious before the U.S. Federal Reserve's
first monetary policy meeting this year on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
 The euro  ran as high as $1.3660 on trading
platform EBS, a fresh two-month high against the dollar. It
was later trading up 0.31 percent at $1.3657.
 The single European currency was also supported by
technical momentum after breaking key levels last week, but
analysts feared the rally was close to an end as political
turmoil in Ireland was a reminder of the uncertainties
plaguing the most indebted European countries.

 ""The euro's had a sharp rebound recently, but we think
it's nearing its top in the bigger picture,"" said Ian
Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""It's supported in the near-term by optimism over talks on
the European rescue fund, but political problems in Ireland
and Portugal show there are still lots of factors out there to
hurt the currency,"" he added.
 The U.S. dollar slipped 0.4 percent against a basket of
major currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>.
Against the Japanese yen , it was nearly flat at 82.57.
 STOCKS MODESTLY HIGHER
 Global stocks scored moderate gains as mixed corporate
results tempered markets after a multi-week rally. Analysts
said, however, that stocks would need positive surprises to
keep rising.
 ""It's going to be tough for us to move higher since we
need to digest the long period we had of nice gains with
little volatility,"" said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst
at John Thomas Financial in New York.
 ""We'd need really very good earnings numbers and forecasts
to continue up, and so far the numbers have been just OK.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> extended its
eighth week of gains, rising 76.06 points, or 0.64 percent, to
11,947.90. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> added 5.82
points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,289.17, and the Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> rose 21.14 points, or 0.79 percent, to
2,710.68.
 Global fast-food giant McDonald's Corp  pressured
markets after it reported a fourth-quarter profit in line with
expectations but disappointing December sales. [ID:nN24164560]
 In Europe, Philips Electronics  weighed on
blue-chips after reporting lower-than-expected fourth-quarter
net profit on poor TV sales and predicting tepid consumer
spending in mature markets this year.
 World shares as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 0.6 percent, while the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up
0.3 percent after data showed uneven growth in the euro zone's
services sector. [ID:nSLALCE7NA]
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell $1.00, or 1.12 percent,
to $88.11 per barrel in choppy trading, even as heating oil
futures were lifted by U.S. cold weather.
 Still weighing on oil prices was last week's U.S. data
showing an increase in oil inventories against forecasts for
lower stockpiles.
 Prices of U.S. Treasuries were flat to slightly higher as
traders made adjustments in advance of upcoming supply and the
Fed's meeting. The benchmark 10-year note  was up
2/32 in price, with the yield at 3.40 percent.
 The Fed is expected to buy $29 billion in U.S. debt,
buying Treasuries on four of five trading days this week. It
will also issue a policy statement on Wednesday after its
meeting.

 NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro rose for a fifth day
on Monday, climbing to a fresh two-month high against the
dollar as investors overcame earlier doubts on the currency's
prospects and pushed it through key technical and trading
levels on expectations of higher euro zone interest rates.
 Political turmoil in Ireland again highlighted problems in
indebted euro zone countries and a suicide bombing at Russia's

momentum clearly gained in the New York session. 
 Tough talk on inflation pressures from European Central
Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet on Sunday was the key catalyst
that helped to push the euro to its strongest since late
November. [ID:nLDE70M0GT]
 ""They are closer to tightening in the euro zone with a lot
less spare capacity and it is realistic to expect the ECB to
tighten before the Federal Reserve,"" said Kathy Lien, director
of research at GFT Forex in New York.
 The euro  was up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.3673
on electronic trading platform EBS, after climbing as high as
$1.3683. Euro gains accelerated after stop loss orders at
$1.3615 to $1.3620 were breached.
 Solid data on euro zone industrial orders and a robust euro
zone flash estimate of services purchasing managers activity
also bolstered the currency. [ID:nSLALCE7NA] [ID:nBRLOCE7AH]
 The euro has rallied some 6 percent in the past two weeks,
aided by increasing international support for the euro zone's
debt rescue plan and concerns that higher inflation will prompt
a rate rise in the next few months.
 The spread between euro zone and U.S. bond yields has
widened as a result and boosted the euro, but some analysts are
more cautious, arguing that weakness in some member countries,
including Ireland, Greece and Portugal, may hold the ECB back
from raising rates in the near term.

Fianna Fail party at the weekend, plunging the country into
political turmoil as it tries to pass a budget bill to access a

 ""The political crisis should not impact Ireland's aid
agreement with the EU and IMF, but could deter other
governments in indebted euro zone nations from seeking
financial aid in a timely manner for fear of a similar
political backlash,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 The euro retained a key technical level around $1.3570, a
50 percent retracement of its decline from November to early
January. Technical analysts say it must hold above that level
on a sustained basis to extend its gains.
 Technical analysts say the next target to the upside is
around $1.3695, the October 20 low.
 EURO POSITIONING FLIPS
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at 112.75 yen on EBS
, just off a two-month high hit in earlier trade
and still hovering above its 200-day moving average.
 The euro's gains on Monday helped to push the dollar lower
against the yen. The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 82.47 yen on
EBS .
 The euro's broad rally has cleared out short positions,
bets that the shared currency would depreciate.

speculators shifted to 4,109 net long contracts last week,
versus 45,182 net shorts the previous week. Total long

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2011 11:15AM ET</span>","INTERVIEW-Kenyan 2010 sugar output down, better 2011 seen"," * Dry weather hurt output
 * Privatisation push
 
 By Mark Denge
 NAIROBI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Kenya's 2010 sugar output dipped
4.5 percent to 523,522 tonnes due to a weather-induced cane
shortage in some zones but should rebound by 6 percent in 2011,
the industry regulator said on Monday.
 East Africa's largest economy remains a sugar importer and
is struggling to boost output due to relatively high production
costs and poorly funded sugar factories.
 ""There was stress on cane due to poor rains. The shortage
was particularly bad in the west Kenya and Nyando zones, which
led to mills not crushing at full capacity,"" Solomon Odera,
acting managing director of the Kenya Sugar Board, told Reuters.
 In its record year in 2009, Kenya produced 548,207 tonnes of
sugar thanks to better weather and improved installed capacity.
 But sugar consumption in Kenya continues to outpace
production. In 2010, it was 772,731 tonnes, and the regulator
projected demand for sugar would grow to 794,844 tonnes by 2012.
 ""The main challenges in output growth are to do with the
high cost of sugar production in Kenya relative to producers in
the region. This cost is occasioned by a number of factors, key
among which is the undercapitalisation of sugar factories
especially with the state-owned mills,"" Odera said.
 ""This has tended to keep factories in poor operational
state, with low capacity utilisation, poor sugar recoveries and
lost productivity due to frequent breakdowns,"" he said.
 The regulator estimated the cost of producing a tonne of
sugar at about $570 in western Kenya compared with $240-$290 in
rival producers such as Egypt. Experts blame high costs of
production for making the Kenyan sugar industry uncompetitive.
 
 PRIVATISATION PLANS
 Kenya plans to privatise five sugar factories to cut
inefficiency and boost competitiveness ahead of the end of trade
safeguards in March 2012, which limit imports from the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
 A tentative plan unveiled by the Agriculture Ministry in
early 2010 showed the government would sell a 51 percent stake
in five sugar companies to strategic investors and reserve
another 30 percent for farmers.
 Once factories are profitable, the government would then
sell the remaining 19 percent in the Sony, Chemelil, Nzoia,
Muhoroni and Miwani milling companies in initial public
offerings.
 ""The concerted push for privatisation of the government
owned mills is expected to attract private sector capital for
modernisation and expansion of milling capacity,"" Odera said.
 ""Additionally, several new mills such as Kwale International
in Msambweni, Transmara Sugar Mills and Sukari Mills in Ndhiwa
have already been registered -- all of which are expected to
commence milling operations in 2012-13.""
 The official said surveillance partnerships with other
member countries of COMESA helped prevent distortions in the
Kenyan market through illegal imports.
 ""There is more stringent vetting of entities registered to
import sugar, increased surveillance of imports especially
through other entry points, apart from Mombasa,"" he said
 Odera further said the forthcoming expiry of the COMESA deal
was unlikely to have a major impact on Kenya's market.
 ""The country is a net importer of sugar, and in the past
year or so there has been suppressed supply of sugar both
regionally and internationally. Imports have therefore generally
not affected local production and may not affect us much even
next year,"" he said.

 (Recasts with new comments, background)
 By Gergely Szakacs and Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank raised
borrowing costs to 6 percent on Monday to counter inflation
risks in what analysts said could be the last step in its
three-month-old tightening cycle.
 The bank (NBH) raised its base rate by 25 basis points, as
expected, to a one-year high of 6 percent and said it would
continue to weigh inflation risks in coming months to decide
whether further rate rises were necessary.
 Poland's central bank also raised its key rate last week as
rate setters in Central Europe watch inflation pressures from
rising global food and energy prices and a pickup in economic
growth.
 ""In the coming months, the (Hungarian Monetary) Council will
decide whether to raise interest rates again after considering
the upside risks to inflation,"" it said in a statement issued
after the decision.
 Even so, government bond yields dipped 2-3 basis points
after the decision, a bond dealer said, as some investors
anticipated that Monday's hike marked the peak of the current
tightening cycle.
 ""(This was) probably the last hike from the NBH,"" Danske
Bank said in a note about the decision.
 The policy outlook is clouded by an impending revamp of the
rate-setting Monetary Council when the mandates of four policy
makers on the seven-strong panel expire on Mar. 1.
 Analysts expect a parliamentary committee controlled by the
ruling Fidesz party to appoint more dovish economists who could
halt the bank's tightening cycle, which began in November.
 ""Investors probably believe this is the top of the rate hike
cycle and this is where the new composition council will cut
rates from,"" the bond dealer said.
 NBH Governor Andras Simor -- who brushed aside a question on
whether the changes in March had any bearing on Monday's vote --
said the decision to increase rates further was made with a
""very slim majority"".
 Another option considered was keeping rates on hold and the
panel also discussed a proposal to cut rates the first time for
several months.
 
 HIGH EXPECTATIONS
 Simor said the decision was intended to demonstrate that the
council would do its best to prevent price shocks from
reverberating through the economy and inflation expectations
from getting stuck above the bank's 3 percent target.
 The NBH's past rate increases angered the centre-right
government which has said the decisions were unjustified and
harmed the economy, which needed lower rates.
 Many analysts have seen the bank's tightening in the context
of a policy battle with the government whose unorthodox fiscal
measures have contributed to rising inflation pressures and risk
premia on Hungarian assets since last year.
 The panel in which new members will have a majority will
first meet in March, and analysts have said it could stop or may
even partially reverse the interest rate tightening.
 Analysts said the last decision of the current Council in
February and the measures of the new Council could hinge on the
details of the structural reform programme which the government
has promised to present in the next few weeks.
 ""If there are large enough expenditure cuts, that can bring
a favourable turn in the pricing of Hungarian assets and further
tightening can be avoided,"" said Daniel Bebesy of Budapest Fund
Management.
 ""If not, Hungary's rating will be cut to junk, which will
pose serious problems in the financing of Hungary's public debt,
as the country won't be able to sell debt at current yields,
which will result in rate hikes,"" he added.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2011 08:31AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Equities may not be as attractive as they seem," By Jeremy Gaunt and Scott Barber
 LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A key argument for the global
equity rally that has been running since roughly August is that
valuations are attractive, that stocks in essence are on the
cheap side compared with history.
 They may not be -- either in terms of the risk premium
offered to investors or the price-to-earnings ratio available on
markets. It all depends on how you look at them, particularly
the period used to glean what is a reasonable average.
 Whether they offer good value may also depend on the extent
to which the ructions of the past few years have created a ""new
normal"" in which the economic order has been fundamentally
changed.
 Take, for example, one of the most common methods for
gauging the attractiveness of stocks, which is to look at their
trailing, or actual, P/E ratio in historic terms.
 According to Datastream, the average P/E for its world stock
index is currently 15.9. This implies reasonably good value
compared with an average of 17.2 over the 35 years since 1975.
 But graphing those 35 years shows three quite distinct
periods with very different ""normals"".
 In the decade 1975 to 1985, the average P/E was 11.0. In the
(generally) economically strong years between 1985 and 2005 it
rose to 21.2. Since 2005, it has averaged 15.8.
 This means that stocks are currently quite expensive
compared with the first period, pretty cheap versus the second,
and roughly at fair value compared with the past five years.
 A lot of investors, meanwhile, use a forward P/E based on
estimates of what will happen to gauge stock attractiveness.
 The problem with this is that it is highly dependent on the
accuracy of the analysts' estimates -- which has a spotty
history -- and may mean that the attractiveness is not properly
known until after the fact.
 Andrew Lapthorne, global quantitative strategist at Societe
Generale, has calculated that since 1990, the 12-month forward
P/E for the S&P 500 has overestimated actual earnings by $2.4
trillion.
 That is about one-third of the actual profits of the 500
companies over the period.
 
 RISK PREMIA
 So will things go back to the way they were? Or has the
Great Recession so changed the financial background that we
should be looking at a new ""normal""?
 David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset
Management, is one of those who reckons it may be the latter. In
recent note, he argues that equities are not currently as
attractive as they might seem from a simple equity risk premium
(ERP) standpoint.
 The ERP is the difference between the forward, or expected,
earnings yield of global equities and the real global bond
yield, in other words what you might get from stocks that make
them worth the risk over theoretically safer fixed income.
 Shairp calculates that the current ERP for global equities
is 6.75 percent, which is at the top end of a normal range for
21 years -- specifically plus 1.5 standard deviations -- meaning
equities are a relatively good buy versus government bonds.
 But he suggests that this assumes all will go back to
normal. If you look at EPRs over a shorter period -- one that
better reflects recent market changes -- you get a different
picture.
 Over 10 years, that 6.75 percent is plus 0.81 standard
deviations over the average and over five years it is just plus
0.16 -- in other words, about average.
 Shairp reckons these shorter periods may be better gauges of
where things stand because the crises of the past few years may
lead investors to demand a structurally higher premia than
previously.
 ""The equilibrium has clearly risen over the past few years
(with) the ferocity of the crisis,"" he said.
 Deleveraging of household and other debt accumulated over
the past decade is also likely to weigh on the global growth
trend. Shairp is not alone in believing that trend growth may
be lower and volatility of growth and inflation higher in the
coming decade.
 
 FAIR VALUE
 None of this means that equities are actually expensive.
Nearly all of the comparisons would suggest, rather, that they
are fairly priced.
 There are also plenty of other reasons for investors to buy
stocks -- momentum trading, dividend demand and low returns from
fixed income, for example.
 But the gap between earnings yields and bond yields could
well narrow in the not-too-distant future as the latter have
begun rising on signs of greater growth, higher inflation and
big budget deficits.
 Such narrowing would suggest that the current gap is more of
a reflection of poor expectations for bonds than higher
expectations for equities.
 Meanwhile, data from Robert Shiller, academic and author of
Irrational Exuberance, shows that equities are expensive over a
really long term.
 He calculates that a P/E ratio for the S&P which adjusts for
the cyclical swings in earnings back to 1881 is 16.4, while it
is now 23.9. Even since 1950, the average has been just 18.6.

 ABIDJAN, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S.-based agribusiness giant
Cargill has told its Ivory Coast unit to suspend purchases of
Ivorian cocoa, a senior company official in Abidjan said on
Monday.
 ""We have stopped purchases this morning for an indefinite
period,"" he told Reuters. ""It was a decision of the management.""
 A second source at the company's Ivorian unit with knowledge
of its cocoa purchasing operations confirmed the order.
 A spokesman was not immediately available to comment.
 Ivory Coast presidential claimant Alassane Ouattara called
for a one-month export ban over the weekend to pressure
incumbent Laurent Gbagbo to step down after elections in
November.
 Cargill, one of the largest privately-held companies,
typically buys about 15 percent of the Ivorian cocoa crop. Ivory
Coast is the world's top grower of cocoa, accounting for about a
third of global supply.

 * Ouattara calls for ban to choke presidential rival's cash
 
 (Adds details from Abidjan, updates price)
 By David Brough and Ange Aboa
 LONDON/ABIDJAN, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Cocoa surged to near its
highest price in 30 years on Monday as top producer Ivory
Coast's Alassane Ouattara declared a month-long export ban to
stop revenues reaching his rival for the country's presidency.
 In a signal the market was taking Ouattara's call seriously,
U.S. agribusiness giant Cargill, which typically buys about 15
percent of Ivory Coast's cocoa crop, temporarily suspended cocoa
bean purchases from the West African country.
 Dealers said the market was confused over the potential
impact of Sunday's call by Ouattara -- internationally
recognised as the victor of a Nov. 28 election -- given that
incumbent Laurent Gbagbo controls cocoa flows out of the
country.
 Ouattara, who is in a hotel guarded by U.N. troops, said
anyone contravening the ban, as well as other deals with
Gbagbo's government, would be subject to sanctions.
 But his power to enforce them was in question as Gbagbo, who
has appointed his own administration and rejected pressure to
step down, was likely to do everything possible to facilitate
exports to generate cash to pay the military and state workers.
 A Reuters reporter in Abidjan saw trucks laden with
cocoa beans entering the port, where it was unloaded at
warehouses.
 Some exporters said business was continuing as usual on
Monday, while others said they were unloading beans that had
been previously bought but would not register them in the system
for export, and would be winding down new purchases.
 ""We are going to buy and stock until the situation is
clearer,"" said an Abidjan-based exporter.
 Exporters estimated arrivals at ports had reached around
843,000 tonnes by Jan. 23, up about 11 percent on last year.
 But, citing real time data from the port, the Ivorian cocoa
sector body said on Monday the figure was higher, with 700,000
already exported and another 300,000 tonnes registered, and
therefore ready for export.
 Buyers swooped on the commodity as a precaution, at one
point driving the key ICE second month futures contract,
currently May, up to a one-year peak of $3,340 a tonne before it
settled at $3,282, 3.4 percent up.
 ICE second-month cocoa was within sight of its Dec. 16,
2009, peak of $3,514, the highest level in more than 30 years.
 ""The larger players are taking measures to secure
themselves. People have bought cocoa and cocoa products to
mitigate their risks,"" a big European cocoa trader said.
 ""Everybody is in the dark,"" the trader added.
 A European Union embargo on Ivory Coast cocoa trade is
unlikely for now because of the potential cost to the country's
population, a spokeswoman for the EU's foreign policy chief
Catherine Ashton said on Monday.
 
 ""DISRUPTION WOULD BE HUGE""
 Dealers said that if exporters respect Ouattara's call for a
ban, there will be less availability of cocoa on the
international market, which could send cocoa prices rocketing.
 ""If it's enforced prices of cocoa will go through the roof,""
Gary Mead, analyst with the VM Group in London, said of
Ouattara's call. ""If he's serious, if they can enforce such a
trade embargo, the disruption would be huge.""
 West African regional body ECOWAS has threatened to oust
Gbagbo militarily, and the bloc's chair Nigeria said on Monday
it wanted U.N. backing for military intervention to keep the
Ivorian crisis from destabilising the region.
 Analysts say any such move is some time off and the priority
now is squeezing Gbagbo's finances, including cocoa, which
provides about $1 billion in revenues per year.
 In a sign of concern, Gbagbo's government met exporters on
Monday and instructed them to continue operations as usual.
 Some 260 people have been killed in the crisis.
 While Cargill's decision lent weight to Ouattara's call,
some commentators were sanguine as they expected that beans
would continue to flow despite the political standoff.
 Romain Lathiere, a fund manager with Swiss-based Diapason
Commodities Management, said: ""In the end, the exporters are
still going to be able to export. Cocoa will transit to Ghana,
or other countries, and will still get out.""
 Two European cocoa industry associations said on Monday they
were still seeking clarification of the export ban call.

 * Deficit could top 7 percent of GDP in 2011
 * Lira seen depreciating further, bringing inflation fears
 
 By Alexandra Hudson
 ISTANBUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Turkey's surging current
account deficit makes the country more vulnerable to outside
shocks, posing risks to investors amid doubts over the central
bank's efforts to contain it by letting the lira slide.
 Economic expansion in Turkey typically brings a current
account deficit in its wake but it is the speed at which the
deficit has deteriorated and the reliance on short-term inflows
of ""hot money"" rather than foreign direct investment to finance
it, that have prompted alarm.
 ""If global capital markets were to be hit by some crisis and
create a sudden stop in inflows, a major problem could result,""
said Robert C. Shelburne, chief economist at the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe.
 Consumer goods, made cheaper by a stronger lira, flooded
into Turkey last year alongside energy and raw materials
imports, sending the deficit shooting up from 2.3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2009 to an estimated 6.2 percent, well
in excess of a forecast 5.4 percent.
 ""If we did see an external shock the Turkish lira would
collapse, imports would slump immediately and domestic demand
would drop, halting growth,"" said Mehmet Besimolgu, chief
economist at Oyak Securities.
 While the government expects the shortfall to ease to 5.4
percent of GDP in 2011, some economists say it is
underestimating and forecast the deficit could top 7.0 percent.
 ""Turkey's current account deficit has deteriorated faster
than anywhere else in emerging Europe,"" said Manik Narain,
analyst at UBS in London.
 ""There isn't really a threshold regarding the size of the
deficit at which investors would stop investing ... but given
where the deficit is now and given currency volatility they
could be thinking twice.""
 In the interests of safeguarding financial stability the
central bank embarked last month on a radical new policy of
cutting interest rates to bring down yields and deter hot money.
 At the same time, it raised required reserve ratios to
balance inflationary effects and cool rampant credit growth, by
forcing lenders to deposit more money with the central bank
rather then dishing it out in cheap loans to consumers.
 Since then the lira  has fallen 5 percent against the
dollar and 7.5 percent against the euro. Many analysts now see
the lira depreciating to levels of 1.65 to the dollar from
current levels of 1.58, with the blessing of the central bank.
 While a weaker lira may curb import growth and revive
exports it also carries a risk of higher inflation --
potentially putting the brakes on Turkish growth, which is
forecast at 4.5 percent in 2011 and 5 percent in 2012, and
hitting Turkish asset prices.
 The bank says the overall effect of its measures is
""tightening"" and reassures it sees inflation meeting its 2011
target of 5.5 percent. A survey of business leaders, however,
shows expectations for year-end inflation at 6.61 percent.
 ""The bank is trying to achieve financial stability and low
inflation and may in the end achieve neither,"" said Narain.
 ""So far the lira weakening has been as a result of investors
cutting long positions, but what we have yet to see is debt and
equity market outflows which could be the next risk,"" he added.
 
 POLICY DOUBTS
 Ankara has surprised with its ability to keep borrowing in a
tight spot before -- not least when it shunned a new IMF
stand-by loan in the depths of the 2009 economic crisis.
 In fact, improved fiscal discipline, lower borrowing costs
and a highly capitalised banking system have put Turkey within
sight of an investment grade rating, which could come after a
June general election if the government keeps spending tight.
 If Turkey can sustain growth of 5 percent annually in the
next few years and the current account deficit remains at around
5 percent of GDP over the same period, external debt should not
get excessive, analysts say.
 Central to the deficit outlook is the behaviour of Turkey's
banks. What may prevent large-scale capital flight is the view
that the commercial banks, which saw loan growth of 34 percent
in 2010, are prudent, highly regulated and robust.
 Unlike some emerging peers they are not run by troubled
foreign parents -- and issued most loans in local currency.
 This stability should allow Turkey, an unsaturated banking
market with huge demand for mortgages and loans, to absorb 2011
credit growth estimated at 25 percent without overheating.
 Banks will also this year for the first time be able to
issue Turkish lira bonds, tapping domestic funding.
""I've not seen in Turkey the excesses I've seen in other
countries,"" said Marco Cravario, chief financial officer of Yapi
Kredi Bank, Turkey's fourth-largest lender by market value.
 ""Elsewhere banks were extending 10-year general purpose
loans. Here the average maturity of general purpose loans is
below three years.""
 The central bank hopes more moderate loan growth will sap
consumer demand for foreign goods -- and quell the trade gap.
 Rising oil prices, rendered even more expensive by a weaker
lira, could thwart any attempt to curb the deficit however,
analysts say.
 To retain sound investor confidence, Turkey will need a
benign global backdrop and the kind of policy visibility some
see lacking at the central bank.
 ""Right now it looks like their measures could just affect
the lira rather than reverse the current account deficit,""
Besimolgu said. ""We couldn't understand what they are doing.""
 Turkish government bonds have been highly volatile this
month -- with the benchmark yield trading between 6.87 and 7.69
percent -- amid confusion about whether the central bank would
keep cutting interest rates and uncertainty last week about the
size of another increase in reserve ratios which was not
clarified until Monday.
 Turkish equities meanwhile are starting to look pricey after
rallying 27 percent last year as the economy grew around 8
percent, beating a 16 percent gain in the emerging stocks index.
 Analysts say that to help maintain investor confidence the
government needs to speed up longer-term structural projects
which would help cut the current account deficit, such as
building nuclear power stations to reduce energy imports.
""When the current account deficit reaches 6.2 percent you
have to do everything right - you need a good framework, good
policy predictability and the right policies,"" said Murat Ucer,
an analyst with Global Source in Istanbul.

 COPENHAGEN, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Danish shipping and oil group
A.P. Moller-Maersk is better prepared for volatility than before
the crisis, and it aims to boost its presence in emerging
markets this year, its chief executive said in a company
newsletter.
 Chief Executive Nils Smedegaard Andersen said in the monthly

shipping business is able to boost or reduce capacity on shorter
notice, which made it better prepared for volatility.
 ""Volatility will most likely be a key word for 2011 and some

were in 2008,"" Andersen said in a lead article.
 Global trade would continue to grow, particularly in
emerging markets, he said.
 ""(Emerging market) economies are developing rapidly, and a
growing middle class demand more imported consumer goods,""
Andersen said.
 ""We already have a strong presence in emerging markets, but
one of our priorities for 2011 is to tip the balance of our
business from the `old' to the new markets and dedicate even
more attention and investments for them,"" Andersen said.
 ""We are making very good cash flows and good profits, which
means we have the strength to invest at the moment, probably
also more strength than many of our competitors,"" Andersen said
in an interview with the newsletter.
 He said the biggest challenge is to identify the right
projects in energy, trade or infrastructure, and then work
to get them.
 Andersen reiterated that it was a priority for the Maersk
group to strengthen its oil and gas business in 2011, both in
terms of reserves and operational capabilities.

 By Beatrice Gachenge and Helen Nyambura-Mwaura
 NAIROBI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Favourable weather and
currencies boosted Kenya's 2010 tea crop and export earnings to
record levels, and the sector overtook horticulture as the
country's top hard currency earner, officials said on Monday.
 The Tea Board of Kenya said output leapt 27 percent to a
record 399 million kgs and export earnings by 40 percent to 97
billion shillings ($1.2 billion), surging past horticulture
which brought in 78 billion.
 Kenya is the world's leading exporter of black tea. In 2009,
it produced 314 million kgs that earned 69 billion shillings.
 ""The drivers of growth for 2010 were purely good weather and
a stable foreign exchange rate,"" Sicily Kariuki, managing
director at the Tea Board of Kenya, told a news conference.
 ""This brings the tea industry as the leading export earner
in this country.""
 The average price for tea sold at the Mombasa auction rose
slightly to $2.75 per kg in 2010 from $2.72 in 2009.
 Kariuki said production would probably fall to 360 million
kgs in 2011 due to unreliable rainfall. Dry weather may cut the
first quarter's output by 23 percent to 85 million kgs.
 Good rains for most of 2010 spurred agricultural output in
east Africa's largest economy. Horticulture also had a rosy
2010, with export earnings rising from 71.6 billion the previous
year, despite disruptions in European markets.
 The tea board said exports to emerging Asian economies
boosted Kenya's tea earnings.
 ""The growing economies of India and China have seen the
middle-class increase tea consumption,"" Kariuki said.
 Exports to China jumped 65 percent to 1.5 million kgs and
those to India grew 46 percent to 5.4 million kgs in 2010
compared with 2009, the board said. 
 United Arab Emirates emerged as one of the fastest growing
destinations for Kenyan tea in 2010 with a 73 percent jump to
22.2 million kgs thanks to the incentives it offers. 
 Dubai offers enticements such as 60 days of free
warehousing, an efficient port and good infrastructure, which
has made it an attractive blending and redistribution location. 
 Kariuki told Reuters that tea-plucking machines, which have
caused an uproar from unions, were a necessary evil in light of
the high cost of production.
 Labour accounts for 45-60 percent of total production costs.
About 3 million people, including small-scale farmers, are
employed by the industry, she said.
 There was evidence the machines did not have a major impact
on the quality of tea as feared but that the topography of some
growing areas would not allow their use, Kariuki said.
 ""With the rising cost of production, mechanisation is the
devil we must contend with,"" she said.

 * Data points to weakness of household demand
 
 (Recasts with economists' comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial new orders
rose more than expected in November, data showed on Monday,
confirming the strength of euro zone recovery in industry but
pointing to weakness in demand for consumer goods.
 The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said
industrial new orders in the 16 countries using the euro in
November rose 2.1 percent month-on-month against October, for a
19.9 percent year-on-year gain.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 2.0 percent
monthly increase and a 17.1 percent annual rise.
 ""This confirms the strength of the economic recovery in the
euro zone,"" said Dominique Barbet, senior economist at BNP
Paribas.
 Without the volatile orders for ships, planes and trains,
industrial orders rose 2.1 percent on the month and were 19.6
percent higher than a year earlier.
 But while demand for capital and intermediate goods was
strong, orders for durable consumer goods fell 0.9 percent
month-on-month and non-durable consumer goods orders were down
1.5 percent, pointing to a weakness in household demand.
 ""The breakdown of orders, with weakness for consumer goods,
also illustrates that recovery is still primarily driven by the
manufacturing sector and exports in particular, thanks to the
impressive German performance,"" Barbet said.
 ""The recovery is not yet broad-based, either on a
geographical or product distribution, which could be a source of
fragility over the medium term,"" he said.
 Industrial new orders translate into industrial production,
which is the key component of gross domestic product (GDP)
growth.
 Euro zone GDP rose 0.4 percent in the third quarter against
the previous three months, after a 1 percent expansion in the
second quarter and some economists expect growth may be 0.4-0.5
percent for the last three months of 2010.
 ""Robust orders in November following on from the upbeat
manufacturing purchasing survey for January indicates that the
near-term outlook for euro zone industrial production is very
promising,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 He noted however, that inventory rebuilding in the euro
zone, which had helped orders in past months, could well be
drawing to a close while domestic demand was likely to be
increasingly limited by tighter fiscal policy.
 ""Euro zone manufacturers will be hoping therefore that
global growth holds up well in 2011 and that the euro trades at
a relatively competitive level,"" Archer said.

 * French leader says no plans to call dollar into question
 * Sarkozy eyes political boost before 2012 election
(Updates with White House comment, details on working group)
 By Catherine Bremer and Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy
called on Monday for new rules to curb commodity price
volatility, warning as he laid out his G20 agenda that the
world risks food riots and weaker growth if leaders fail to
act.
 Addressing 300 diplomats and journalists at his Elysee
palace to kick off his stewardship of the G20, Sarkozy seemed
to row back on other stated goals of exploring changes to the
global monetary system and the dollar's role as reserve
currency and reforming global economic governance.
 Focusing on better transparency and regulation of
commodities markets may allow Sarkozy to achieve real progress,
after recent meetings with world leaders such as U.S. President
Barack Obama and China's Hu Jintao indicated he would struggle
to win unanimous support for broader issues.
 ""How can you explain that we regulate money markets and not
commodities?"" Sarkozy said, speaking in an ornate ballroom in
only the third major Paris-based news conference of his
presidency.
 ""If we don't do anything we run the risk of food riots in
the poorest countries and a very unfavourable effect on global
economic growth,"" he said. ""The day there are food riots, what
country at the G20 table will say this does not concern them?""
 Asked about France's idea of looking at ways to wean the
world off the dollar as sole reserve currency, such as
broadening the IMF's Special Drawing Right currency basket, and
what support it had from G20 partners, Sarkozy was more coy.
 ""The dollar is, and will remain, the predominant currency,""
he said, adding: ""A predominant currency doesn't mean a sole
currency, we are allowed to reflect on things.""

 Sarkozy also brought up an old idea of taxing financial
transactions to fund a proposed $100 billion a year in aid for
poor countries, which France would back as it would be a tax on
speculators. He admitted, though, that some would oppose it.
 TRANSPARENCY
 With euro zone policymakers preoccupied with the bloc's
debt crisis, economists note now would be a tricky time for
anyone to push sweeping reforms of the monetary system.
 ""It's becoming more popular everywhere to have more
transparency (in commodities). I wouldn't be surprised if he
could find some kind of consensus there,"" said Gilles Moec,
senior European economist at Deutsche Bank.
 ""On currencies and this big question of the international
monetary system, I guess any European leader is not in the best
position right now to talk about this. So I'm not surprised
he's talking down these issues and concentrating on things that
are more achievable.""
 German Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Asmussen will co-chair
a G20 working group to reform the international foreign
exchange system, a ministry document showed on Monday.
 Sarkozy, an unpopular conservative who hopes his leadership
of the economic forum could boost his chances of reelection in
2012, has a three-pronged agenda for his G20 presidency:
tackling swings in commodity prices, finding ideas for a new
Bretton Woods system and redrawing economic governance rules.
 Critics are sceptical of how much progress he can make in a
year, especially after lukewarm meetings with Hu and Obama.
 The White House declined to comment specifically on
Sarkozy's proposals.
 ""As France assumes the presidency of the G-8 and the G-20
for 2011, we look forward to working with President Sarkozy on
issues of common concern,"" an administration official said.
 Sarkozy ran into U.S. resistance to his idea to establish a
new Bretton Woods, the monetary order set up on the ashes of
World War Two which leans heavily on the dollar.
 On a visit to the White House this month, he was at pains
to stress to Obama that his currency plans would not put the
dollar's role at risk -- a message he reiterated on Monday,
saying: ""France does not want to call the dollar into
question.""
 Sarkozy also went out of his way to reassure China he would
not join Washington in pressing Beijing to allow its yuan
currency to appreciate, saying: ""China is a major nation, far
be it from me to tell them what to do about their currency.""
 The third plank of Sarkozy's agenda, creating a permanent
G20 institutional framework parallel to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, also faces resistance.
 Shifting the focus of his G20 presidency onto commodities
not only means more chance of achieving concrete goals, but
concentrates his efforts on a theme seen as a potential vote
winner ahead of an April 2012 French presidential election.
 Sarkozy's popularity is near record lows around 30 percent
and polls show that today he would lose an election to the
left.
 FRANCE BLAMES SPECULATORS
 France, the EU's biggest grain producer, has blamed
financial speculation for contributing to soaring commodity
prices. Analysts are divided over whether this has played as
significant a role as economic fundamentals in driving prices.
 Wheat prices in Europe nearly doubled in 2010, while a
global economic rebound helped push oil prices nearly 30
percent higher in the last four months of 2010 alone.
 Policymakers fear rising food prices could stoke inflation,
protectionism and the kind of unrest that has been seen in
Tunisia and Algeria in recent weeks. High food prices could
also hit consumer spending in fast-growing emerging countries
that are leading the revival of the global economy.
 Washington has acted to prevent spikes in food prices and
Europe is following suit, with proposals that would force
traders to disclose their positions, put a cap on large trades
and give regulators new powers to intervene to curb
speculation.
 But there are deep divisions within the broader G20 on how
far any new global regulations should go, with major
commodities producers pitted against consumer nations.
 ""It's going to be difficult to have a global consensus on
position limits until the case is better made,"" a G20 source
told Reuters after Sarkozy spoke.
 In his remarks, Sarkozy also touched on Tunisia and Ivory
Coast, two former French colonies in political turmoil.
 Protests in Tunisia forced out long-time president Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali earlier this month, while Ivory Coast
incumbent Laurent Gbagbo has refused to concede defeat after a
November election he is widely recognised to have lost.
 Sarkozy said there was only one ""legal and legitimate""
government in Ivory Coast -- one led by Gbagbo's rival Alassane
Ouattara. He said France would offer economic aid to help the
transitional government in Tunisia.

 * China leads drive to link Southeast Asia's economies	
 
 By Martin Petty	
 BANGKOK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Southeast Asia's foreign
ministers embarked on an unconventional land, sea and air trip
to China on Monday to push ambitious plans to fully connect the
region's frontier markets with Asia's biggest economic power.	
 The day-long trip from Thailand to China, organised by the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), showcases an
infrastructure plan to increase trade, investment and tourism,
underscoring strengthening ties between the 11 countries
involved with a combined GDP of nearly $6 trillion.	
 The ""connectivity masterplan"" to link new and existing rail,
road and sea routes and allow seamless travel within a free
trade area of 1.9 billion people is complex and ambitious.	
 But analysts say there is huge trade potential between ASEAN
and China and better links could encourage powers like Japan and
South Korea to forge a closer relationship with 10-member ASEAN.	
 ""With ASEAN in general, all roads are going to China. It's a
good logistical move that might stimulate other regional players
to step up,"" said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a strategic studies
specialist at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.	
 ""ASEAN needs to make a strong economic commitment and by
moving towards China, it's definitely doing that. It's taken a
big and decisive step.""	
 The ministers started their trip in Chiang Rai on the Thai
side of the ""Golden Triangle"", before crossing the Mekong River
by barge to Houey Xay in Laos. They travel by coach to Jinghong
in China's Southwest Yunnan province and will then fly to
Kunming for a meeting on Tuesday.	
 ""We are now passing through a deep valley making our way to
the city of Luang Nam Tha, in less than one hour, that's our
lunch and we're hungry!"" said ASEAN Secretary General Surin
Pitsuwan in one of dozens of excited tweets, that one from Laos.	
 
 RAILROAD OVERHAUL	
 In a statement issued earlier, Surin said ASEAN and China
were now loosely connected but urgent improvements would be made
before 2015, the year when ASEAN wants to become an integrated
community in a model similar to the European Union.	
 He said the trip aimed ""to demonstrate to the world that we
are effectively connected and this connection will certainly
improve by the time ASEAN becomes one community"".	
 Central to the plan is linking a system of high-speed rail
lines, a move spearheaded and financed largely by China, which
will provide loans and technology to Laos and Thailand and
develop networks that allow rail travel all the way to
Singapore.	
 Last October, Cambodia reopened a stretch of railway that
was destroyed during the country's civil war, part of a $141
million project to repair 650 km (400 miles) of track, with an
$84 million investment from the Asian Development Bank.	
 That will connect the capital, Phnom Penh, with Vietnam to
the east and Thailand to the west, and it aims to transform
Cambodia into a regional transport hub. Studies are under way to
link Phnom Penh to Vietnam's economic hub, Ho Chi Minh City.	
 Japan insists it is not being left out and sees benefits
from improved transport links that would allow goods to move
between Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos and cut costs for
Japanese firms with manufacturing bases in Thailand.	
 Kimihiro Ishikane, deputy director-general of Asian and
Oceanian affairs at the Japanese foreign ministry, said it was
in Japan's interests to have better connections and uniform
customs, visa and cargo procedures in all the countries.	
 ""The region is a favoured destination of investment for
Japan, so many Japanese are focusing on this area and we see
huge potential,"" he told Reuters in a recent interview.	
 ""Connectivity must be enhanced and infrastructure has to be
both physical and institutional. We're positive, but we're not
expecting too much too soon,"" he added.	
 Pavin of ISEAS said ASEAN needed to pay close attention to
problems that could arise from improved links, such as
transnational crime, illegal migration and drug smuggling.	
 ""There will be side-effects and we have to be realistic
because 2015 may be too soon,"" he said. ""ASEAN is good at form,
but it still lacks substance, but this is step forward.""

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Disappointing earnings from
European blue-chip Philips knocked regional stocks back on
Monday while the euro retreated after storming to a two-month
high.
 Wall Street looked set for a lower opening. Emerging market
stocks were weak, hurt by inflation worries.
 Debt-ridden Ireland's politics were in focus and emerging
market stocks were weak, hurt by inflation worries.
 Investors were trading against a background of improved, if
uneven, economic data for the euro zone.
 The flash purchasing manager services index for the single
currency zone came in above expectations, confirming gathering
strength. Markit's index, comprising surveys of around 2,000
businesses ranging from banks to hotels, rose to 55.2 from 54.2
in December, comfortably beating expectations of 54.3.
 Worries about euro zone debt have eased in recent weeks on
the back of renewed economic vigour in core economies and on
hopes for a beefing-up of the bloc's rescue fund.
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was quoted on
Sunday as saying the country's conservative coalition government
wants to deliver a comprehensive package soon to strengthen the
EFSF bailout fund.
 But there is also concern about Ireland, which has been at
the centre of the crisis, after its junior coalition party
withdrew from Prime Minister Brian Cowen's government on Sunday,
signalling the end of a crisis-riddled administration and
hastening an election due on March 11.
 ""You've got to think Ireland's going to come under some
pressure... but it remains to be seen whether that upsets the
positive tone in the rest of the periphery,"" a bond trader said.
 The euro was down half a percent at $1.3564 but only after
hitting a new two-month high of $1.3648 in early Asian trading.
 Speculators turned long on the euro for the first time in
two months in the week ended Jan. 18 while doubling their bets
against the dollar, figures from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed on Friday.
 
 STOCKS SLIP
 World shares as measured by MSCI were slightly lower,
weighed down by European and emerging market stocks.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down
0.2 percent, off its lows but having started in positive
territory. It has been an outperformer for much of this year.
 Philips Electronics weighed on the index, after reporting
lower-than-expected fourth-quarter net profit on poor TV sales.
It warned that consumers in mature markets will be reluctant to
spend this year.
 Earlier, concerns about rising inflation gave investors an
excuse to book profits in some Asian markets after strong
rallies in 2010, but rather than exiting the region, funds were
being reallocated to countries seen as having a better grip on
price pressures.
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.5 percent, with resource
shares popular and recently beaten-down exporters bought amid
expectations of robust earnings reports from Japanese firms this
week.
Spot gold rose around 0.5 percent to around $1,347 per ounce,
after posting its third consecutive weekly loss..

 NEW DELHI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - India is not holding its
breath for progress at this week's meeting of top negotiators
pushing for a global trade accord because of scant engagement
by the United States, Trade Secretary Rahul Khullar said on
Monday.
 Washington has shown little appetite for engagement on the
Doha round of negotiations and threatens to put the talks in
reverse gear by re-opening items already negotiated in the hope
of giving greater market access to U.S. business, he said.
 Trade ministers will meet at the World Economic Forum in
Davos which could give fresh impetus to the Doha round, working
towards a revised text which should be settled by April if the
negotiations are to be concluded by the end of the year.
 The European Union has also convened an informal meeting to
host global big hitters the United States, China, Brazil,
India, Japan and Australia to make a special push for Doha,
which has progressed in fits and starts since its inception in
2001.
 ""What is there to hold your breath for?"" Khullar said in an
interview to Reuters.
 ""There's been engagement but I don't see the kind of
progress you need to narrow differences,"" he said. ""At least
what's being reported to me from Geneva does not convey any
impression as if the Americans have moved.""
 India and the United States were the focus of a dispute
that caused the talks to skid in 2008, and their agreement on
anything from agricultural tariffs to industrial goods will be
crucial to the talks' success.
 The Doha round of trade talks was launched nearly a decade
ago to help poor countries prosper through trade, and advocates
say a deal will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the
world economy.
 The EU's move for a separate, informal meeting at the Swiss
meet on Jan. 28 was seen as a possible signal that political
momentum may be building to complete the talks. [ID:nLDE70G24B]
 Washington wants greater market access for U.S. businesses,
especially in rapidly emerging India.
 Both sides have accused each other of policy foot-dragging
over Doha. In India there is a sense that New Delhi is much
keener to push for a deal than Washington.
 The United States complains that India has not accepted the
responsibility that comes with its growing economic strength in
the world and insists on shielding many sectors.
 ""Re-opening settled sectors runs the risk of unravelling
years and years of progress in negotiations,"" Khullar said,
referring to sectors such as cotton. ""Why would anybody want to
do that?""

(Adds comment, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro backed off a two-month
high against the dollar on Monday after an early burst of buying
ran out of steam, while political turmoil in Ireland highlighted
uncertainties facing heavily indebted euro zone countries.
 Tough talk on inflation pressures from European Central Bank
chief Jean-Claude Trichet on Sunday helped to push the euro as
high as $1.3648, its strongest since late November, but a lack
of follow-through demand knocked the single currency back down.
 In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Sunday,
Trichet said core inflation was not a good gauge of future price
pressures and that the central bank was ensuring higher energy
prices do not seep into other prices.
 Investors also followed developments in Ireland after the
resignation of Prime Minister Brian Cowan as leader of the
Fianna Fail party has plunged the country, which has sought a
bailout from the EU and the IMF, into political turmoil.
""The euro's rise was driven by stop-losses, and once those
were taken out there were no more bids in the market,"" said
Anders Soderberg, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Yet he added that while the euro may enter a consolidation
phase in the near term, it was likely resume its climb. Market
participants have said sovereign interest in the euro has been a
key driver in the euro's rally since earlier in the month.
""To make the euro come off even more, you have to get weak
euro zone countries come back into focus, or signs that the U.S.
economy is improving strongly, raising speculation of higher
rates there,"" Soderberg said.
 The euro has rallied some 6 percent in the past two weeks
thanks to a mixture of demand from Asian central banks, easing
worries over euro zone debt and increasing international support
for the euro zone's rescue plan.
 In early Europe, the euro slipped 0.3 percent on the day to
a session low around $1.3565, with traders citing selling demand
from a German name as pushing the single currency lower.
 It was flat against the yen at 112.56 yen, off a two-month
high around 112.80 yen hit in earlier trade.
 Some in the market said the euro found support after German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was quoted in a German
newspaper on Sunday as saying the government wants to deliver a
a comprehensive euro debt rescue package soon.
 Others said political turmoil Ireland raised concerns of
whether the government would be able to approve key financial
legislation, and when a next election would be called. Such
uncertain may weigh on the euro in the near term, some said.
 ""The macro-political circumstances in Ireland are evidence
that we still have a very long way to go before the degree of
political and economic cooperation amongst euro area governments
can be described as 'unshakable',"" analysts at Schneider FX said
in a note.
 The euro's broad rally has resulted in a clearing out of
short positions in the single currency, or bets the currency
would depreciate.
 The latest CFTC data show IMM positions held by speculators
shifted to 4,109 net long contracts last week, versus 45,182 net
shorts the previous week.
 ""After speculators flip their positionings, they tend to
build up more of their new positions for some time. So the euro
still looks to be on a rising trend to me,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank in Tokyo.
 The euro held above key resistance around $1.3570, a 50
percent retracement of its decline from November to early this
month. The next target is $1.3740, a 61.8 percent retracement of
its decline from November to early this month.
 But the pullback in the euro on Monday helped to support the
dollar, which rose 0.3 percent to 82.87 yen, while the U.S.
currency rose 0.2 percent versus a currency basket.

 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Vibrant growth in Germany helped
the euro zone's services sector expand faster in January despite
growing weakness elsewhere in the bloc, early findings from a
business survey showed on Monday.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), comprising surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging
from banks to hotels, rose to 55.2 from 54.2 in December,
comfortably beating expectations of 54.3.
 That marked its 17th month above the 50 mark that divides
growth from contraction, while its new business index hit a
39-month high of 55.4, up from December's 53.9. However, jobs
growth slowed for the second month in a row during January.
 Survey compiler Markit warned that behind the strong
headline figures, there were few signs that firms in peripheral
countries like Ireland and Spain were catching up with peers in
Germany and France, the biggest euro zone economies.
 ""If anything it's becoming a German concentration of
strength,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
 ""France moved down a gear compared to much of last year, but
nothing like what we're seeing outside where the periphery is
close to stagnation.""
 Peripheral euro zone countries, which include the likes of
Ireland and Spain which are already struggling with a debt
crisis, have seen new orders fall in four of the last five
months, said Williamson.
 German business morale rose to its highest in 20 years in
January, the Munich-based Ifo institute said on Friday, two days
after the German government raised its 2011 growth forecast by
half a percentage point to 2.3 percent. [ID:nLDE70K0L2]
 The individual PMI series for Germany released earlier on
Monday painted a similar picture of strength, with record growth
of services new orders and the headline services PMI hitting
60.0, a 55-month high.
 In France, services growth accelerated in January but the
expansion of its manufacturing sector slowed slightly, marked by
a slight decline in employment there.
 Overall, Williamson said January's PMI data was consistent
with first quarter euro zone economic growth of around 0.7
percent.
 
 COST CONTROL
 The flash euro zone manufacturing PMI edged down slightly to
56.9, from 57.1 in December, as growth of new orders eased from
an eight-month high, although the output component held up at a
six-month high of 58.6, up from 58.4 last month.
 After a week of statements about inflation risks from
European Central Bank policymakers, the PMIs showed factory
input prices rose in January at the fastest rate since the
series started in 1997.
 The manufacturing input prices index surged to 79.8 in
January from last month's 74.1, as Markit said companies
highlighted higher prices for fuel, food and metals, such as
steel and copper. Output price growth also picked up.
 ""Price pressures have increased, especially in
manufacturing, although weak demand in the periphery is helping
to keep a lid on the pass-through of these costs to customers,""
said Markit's Williamson.
 The flash composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and
PMI data for a broader snapshot of the euro zone's private
sector, rose to 56.3 in January from 55.5 in December.
 While showing a pick-up in new business, the survey's
employment index slipped to 52.1 from 52.5 last month, a
three-month low.
 ""Employment also continued to fall outside of the two
largest countries, especially in the service sector, which is
feeling the pinch from austerity-hit domestic demand more than
manufacturing,"" said Williamson.
 A Reuters poll of economists last week showed economists do
not expect euro zone unemployment to subside much this year from
the latest official rate of 10.1 percent.

 The order bans imports of pork and pork-containing products
excluding those which are accompanied by a document of German
veterinary service guaranteeing absence of dioxins, as well as
live hogs and piglets.	
 German Farm Minister Ilse Aigner had said on Thursday that
the underlying cause of the dioxin contamination was still

had cost farmers around 100 million euros because of falling
prices and the cost of sealed-off farms. 
 In December 2008, Moscow imposed a ban on pork imports from
25 Irish plants on suspicions that imported meat could contain
dioxins. It lifted the ban from nine plants in May 2009 and from
the remaining 16 in January 2010.	
 Germany is normally allowed to export pork, beef and poultry
to Russia at a discount tariff within quotas.	
 European Union countries have the right to ship into the
country up to 29,000 tonnes of fresh beef, 60,000 tonnes of
frozen beef, 225,000 tonnes of pork and 350,000 tonnes of
poultry meat in 2011.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro backed off a nine-week
high on Monday with sharp gains of the past two weeks on easing
worries about euro zone debt inducing profit-taking, while more
neutral market positioning may make its advance milder.
 The euro held above key resistance around $1.3570 that it
broke on Friday, a 50 percent retracement of its decline from
November to early this month, as data showed speculators have
closed all their bets against the currency.
 Speculators turned long on the euro for the first time in two
months in the week ended Jan. 18 while doubling their bets
against the greenback, figures from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed on Friday.
 ""After speculators flip their positionings, they tend to
build up more of their new positions for some time. So the euro
still looks to be on a rising trend to me,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank.
 The euro fetched $1.3610, having briefly hit a fresh
two-month high of $1.3648 in early Australasian trade on Monday,
slightly below $1.3620 late in New York on Friday.
 The currency piercing resistance around $1.3570 brings into
view $1.3740, a 61.8 percent retracement of its decline from
November to early this month.
 The euro has rallied some 6 percent in the past two weeks
thanks to a mixture of demand from Asian central banks, easing
worries over euro zone debt and increasing international support
for the euro zone's rescue plan.
 But as the commodities commission data shows, speculators no
longer have short positions that need to be closed, so the euro's
momentum is likely to slow, some market players said.
 ""As we can't expect more short-covering, the euro no longer
has an engine for its rally,"" said a trader at a Japanese
brokerage.
 In the options market, one-month implied volatility on the
euro/dollar fell to its lowest level in more than three months in
another sign of rising expectations that any further rise in the
euro will be slower rather than faster.
 Thus the news that Ireland's junior coalition party withdrew
from Prime Minister Brian Cowen's government on Sunday, hastening
an election, was enough to trigger profit-taking.
 Still, euro bears were wary of becoming too negative, having
been badly burnt in the last couple of weeks.
 ""I don't think sovereign debt problems will go away but the
thing is Europe does have a safety net already,"" said Minori
Uchida, a senior analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""And on the other hand it is not as if the U.S. doesn't have
fiscal problems. Its deficit is widening sharply on planned tax
cuts and the finances of many of its states are strained. I
suspect there will be a time later this year when the market will
focus on U.S. debt problems,"" he said.
 The premium on 10-year credit default swaps on U.S. sovereign
debt hit a near two-year high last week and U.S. municipal bonds
have been under pressure for some time.
 While the level of the credit spread on U.S. sovereign debt
is still low, its recent rise contrasted with a fall in credit
spreads in Italy, Spain and Portugal in the past couple of weeks.
 The euro drew additional help from tough talk on keeping
inflation in check from European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude
Trichet.
 In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on
Sunday, Trichet said core inflation was not a good gauge of
future price pressures and that the central bank was ensuring
higher energy prices do not seep into other prices.
 In contrast, the Federal Reserve is more worried about
reviving the job market and the Fed statement on Wednesday is
likely to give only a sober assessment of the sluggish recovery.
 This has helped drive euro zone benchmark German 2-year
yields to one-year highs and pushed its spread to the
equivalent U.S. yield to the widest in about two years, making
the euro more attractive against the dollar for some investors.
 Against the yen, the single currency was at 112.50 yen,
having hit a two-month high of 112.63 in choppy early trade and
rising above its 200-day moving average for the first time in
over a year.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro also held near Friday's
1-1/2-month high of 1.3068 franc, standing at 1.3041.
 The common currency also hit a two-month high against the
Australian dollar near A$1.38.
 ""We'll be watching to see if this momentum remains in place.
With periphery issues no longer fully offsetting the improving
(at least in Germany) macro backdrop, watch the deck of euro
zone PMIs due on Monday,"" said David Watt, strategist at RBC
Capital Markets.
 Data last Friday showed German business morale rose to its
highest level since records started for reunified Germany at the
start of 1991 German reunification, surging past economists'
forecasts.
 The euro's rebound has left the dollar languishing near
two-month lows against a basket of major currencies. The dollar
index last traded at 78.256, not far from a two-month low of
78.096 hit on Friday.
 The dollar bought 82.75 yen, trapped in a range
roughly between 81 yen and 84 yen seen so far this month.
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.9878, dented
by lower-than-expected Australian producer prices.

 * Higher costs in China filtering into global economy	
 * Robust economy fueling commodity price rises in particular	
 * Price pressures in China not expected to get out of hand	
 
 By Alan Wheatley	
 BEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Call it the price of success.	
 China is starting to pass on the rising cost of labour and
other manufacturing inputs as it restructures its economy,
creating a potential new inflation headache for Western
countries already grappling with surging commodity prices.	
 The threat for now is no greater than a distant cloud in a
clear blue sky. Excess capacity and high unemployment in the
United States and Europe mean that most companies will be unable
to pass on higher costs from China and will have to accept lower
profit margins instead.	
 But the evidence is clear.	
 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier this
month that its China import price index rose 0.9 percent in the
fourth quarter after holding broadly steady for the previous 18
months.	
 The index had dropped 3.4 percent during the global
financial crisis, erasing part of a 6.7 percent jump between the
end of 2007 and the middle of 2008.	
 As economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted, that
earlier spike coincided with rising inflation and shortages of
unskilled labour in the coastal provinces that are home to most
of China's exporters. And those are exactly the same conditions
prevailing today.	
 Recent data suggest that, after a two-year pause, China is
on track to become an inflationary force for the global economy
again, the BoA Merrill report said.
 
 COSTS RISING STEADILY	
 Guangdong, the biggest exporting province, said last week
that it would increase minimum wages by around 19 percent in
March. In late December Beijing ordered a 20 percent rise in the
capital, just six months after a similar increase.	
 Rising labour costs reflect the paradox that in a country of
more than 1.3 billion people, China is running short of labour.
Or, more precisely, there is an emerging dearth of younger,
nimble-fingered workers willing to work long hours for a
pittance.	
 The cost of energy, buying land and complying with
environmental legislation is also steadily rising as China
strives to increase the puny share of national income that goes
to labour and to reduce pollution.	
 Prices of products sourced in China are likely to rise at
least 10 percent in the first half of this year, Bruce
Rockowitz, president of global consumer goods exporter Li & Fung
Ltd , told Reuters Insider TV in Hong Kong recently.

 To the extent that the ""China Price"" is rising, it is
exactly the outcome sought by U.S. policymakers who have been
urging China to scrap subsidies and let the yuan's exchange rate
rise in order to remedy what they see as artificially low
production costs that make China super-competitive in global
markets.	
 Dominique Dwor-Frecaut, a strategist with Royal Bank of
Scotland in Singapore, said that China's strong growth was
undoubtedly pushing up global commodity prices.	
 Indeed, the world appeared to be going though a commodity
price shock similar to that in the 1970s, partly a reflection of
generalized asset price reflation engineered by the Federal
Reserves loose monetary policies.	
 ""But it's unfair to say that China is exporting inflation to
the rest of the world through manufactured goods. It is
rebalancing its economy, which means it's paying higher wages
to workers, including in the export sector, and that has
stabilised the price of exports. And it is increasing the value
of its currency to meet the demands of the Americans and the
Europeans. So it's unfair to single out China,"" she said.	
 Given the determination of the ruling Communist Party to
keep a lid on inflation, few economists expect price pressures
to get out of hand, even if 4 percent has now become the new
normal rate that officials expect as they seek to leave more
money in workers' pockets to tackle anger over income
inequality. 
 For one thing, labour usually accounts for no more than 5
percent of a manufacturing company's sales costs. And although
minimum wage increases are grabbing the headlines, double-digit
increases have been the norm for several years with the
exception of 2009.	
 Tao Wang, UBS's chief China economist in Beijing, said the
main reason she does not expect consumer price inflation to get
out of control is that core manufacturing goods prices are still
well behaved and supply is likely to keep pace with demand.	
 The worries about a wage-inflation spiral are exaggerated,
given strong labour productivity growth and lack of collective
bargaining in China, she said.	
 The picture is similar across Asia. Wages are gathering
pace, but the increase in goods prices has been modest despite
the leap in commodities.	
 Part of the explanation, according to J.P. Morgan, is that
unit labour costs have softened around the region since the 2008
recession, although they are picking up in Singapore.	
 To the extent that unit labour costs adjust modestly, this
should continue to restrain price pass-through, though this
needs to watched especially in the context of countries where
labour markets are tightening, J.P. Morgan's economists said in
a report.	
 If rising costs do trickle through the pipeline, expect to
hear cheers from Japans deflation-fighters. Because Japan now
sources 40 percent of its imports of consumer goods from China,
a marked rise in Chinese unit labour costs would have a direct
impact on Japanese inflation, argues Naokazu Koshimizu at Nomura
in Tokyo.	
 As for the United States, Harm Bandholz, chief U.S.
economist at UniCredit Research in New York, expects Chinese
import prices -- and food prices -- to keep climbing.	
 As rents rise and more businesses are forced to pass on
higher costs to consumers, the core inflation rate could rise to
1.5 percent by the end of 2011 from a record low of 0.6 percent
last October. But it would require a much stronger job market
for the Fed to become alarmed, he said.	
 The bottom line is that headline and core inflation rates
are clearly pointing north. But thanks to the low starting
level the Fed will be able to continue its ultra accommodative
monetary policy in the current year. The central bank's primary
goal remains fighting unemployment, Bandholz wrote in a note to
clients.	
 In a nutshell, for now it is in Asia where the wrenching
adjustments to relative prices required to rebalance the global
economy are being felt most acutely.	
 It's creating more inflationary problems for China than it
is for the rest of the world, said Dwor-Frecaut at RBS.

 TOKYO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro backed away from a
nine-week high on profit-taking on Monday, though easing euro
zone debt worries supported the single currency.
 The euro held above key resistance around $1.3570 that it

reviving the job market and the Fed statement on Wednesday is
likely to give only a sober assessment of the sluggish recovery.
 This has helped drive euro zone benchmark German 2-year
yields to one-year highs and pushed its spread to the
equivalent U.S. yield to the widest in about two years, making
the euro more attractive against the dollar for some investors.
 Against the yen, the single currency was last at 112.50 yen,
having hit a two-month high of 112.63 in choppy early trade and
rising above its 200-day moving average for the first time in
over a year.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro also held near Friday's
1-½ month high of 1.3068 franc, standing at 1.3041. The
common currency also hit a two-month high against the Australian
dollar near A$1.38.
 ""We'll be watching to see if this momentum remains in place.
With periphery issues no longer fully offsetting the improving
(at least in Germany) macro backdrop, watch the deck of euro
zone PMIs due on Monday,"" said David Watt, strategist at RBC
Capital Markets.
 The euro's rebound has left the dollar languishing near
two-month lows against a basket of major currencies. The dollar
index last traded at 78.256, not far from a two-month low of
78.096 hit on Friday.
 The dollar bought 82.75 yen, trapped in a range
roughly between 81 yen and 84 yen seen so far this month.
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.9878, dented
by lower-than-expected Australian producer prices.

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Asian stocks outside Japan
struggled to hold on to early gains on Monday, as investors
remained wary before a slew of corporate earnings and a Fed
meeting this week expected to give a cautious readout on the
health of the world's biggest economy.	
 Concerns about rising inflation gave investors an excuse to
book profits in some Asian markets after strong rallies in 2010,
but rather than exiting the region funds were being reallocated
to countries seen as having a better grip on price pressures.	
 Profit-taking also hit the euro, which backed away from a
nine-week high, although easing concerns about Europe's
sovereign debt crisis gave some support to the single currency.	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside of Japan
was flat on the day after being up nearly 0.3
percent in early trade.	
 It posted its worst weekly performance in nearly two months
last week and is down by 1 percent for the month. In contrast,
the Dow Jones industrial average is up 2.5 percent in the
same period.	
 ""The Dow Jones gain on Friday and higher Asian stocks this
morning may provide positive support,"" said Parin
Kitchaotornpitak, a senior analyst at broker Far East Securities
in Bangkok. ""But we still see some pressure from selling by
foreign investors.""	
 Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.5 percent, with
resource shares popular and recently beaten-down exporters
bought amid expectations of robust earnings reports from
Japanese firms this week. 
 The euro stayed above the $1.36 line, having burst
through the key resistance level last Friday, helped by hawkish
comments from the European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude
Trichet which gave markets an excuse to cut short euro
positions. 
 That is in sharp contrast to the Fed, which is likely to
leave policy unchanged at a review on Wednesday and note a
slight improvement in the economy's outlook. .	
 The euro has rallied some 6 percent in the past two weeks on
demand from Asian central banks, traders said. .	
 
 INFLATION, WHAT INFLATION?	
 While sellers targeted stocks in India, China and Indonesia
last week, on worries that authorities were being too slow to
tighten policy, Citigroup strategists said inflation was running
at a lower level than seen during previous cycles.	
 Markus Rosgen, head of Asia ex-Japan strategy at Citigroup,
said inflation in Asia typically tends to pick up during this
stage of the economic cycle as economies grow into their excess
capacity, only to eventually subside.	
 Rosgen recommends buying North Asia and cyclical stocks and
avoiding South Asia, consumer and utility sectors.	
 Moreover, the broad MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan 12-month
forward price/earnings ratio is still below the long-term
average, indicating valuations still remain attractive,
according to Thomson Reuters data, while inflows into emerging
markets have persisted.	
 Data for the third week of January from fund tracker EPFR
Global showed inflows into emerging market equity and bond funds
have continued, with a total of $101 billion flowing into
emerging market equity funds since the start of 2010.	
 Even markets such as Indonesia, which bore the brunt of the
selling last week, stabilised.	
 Spot gold rose around 0.7 percent to above $1,351 per
ounce, after posting its third consecutive weekly loss.
.	
 U.S. crude futures held above the $89 a barrel mark,
on renewed confidence that developed economies are recovering
and will boost demand for commodities. 
 U.S. Treasury yields <0#USBMK=> rose slightly as the market
braced to absorb a total of $99 billion in fresh supply later in
the week. Ten-year Treasury yields were up 2 bps on the day,
just below a two-week high of 3.47 percent hit last week.

"
1535,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2011 06:16PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-France's plans for its G20 presidency," PARIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy will
spell out on Monday the programme for France's year-long
stewardship of the Group of 20.
 Below are the main themes of its presidency:
 
 REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM
 Sarkozy has called for a ""new Bretton Woods"" system for the
21st century which responds to the globalised nature of the
world economy. He has said that the dollar's pre-eminence as a
reserve currency is destabilising and the monetary system must
be reformed to better suit a ""multi-polar"" world.
 French officials say privately that Paris wants to avoid an
appreciation of the euro in a rebalancing of the world economy,
while China continues to anchor its yuan currency to the U.S.
dollar.
 Paris is focusing its discussion of the international
monetary system on three topics: coordination, protection, and
diversification.
 Under the rubric of coordination, France is seeking to
improve the dialogue on economic policies, including a
discussion on 'indicative guidelines' for global imbalances that
was begun under the Korean G20 presidency. These broad
guidelines are expected to take into account specific factors --
such as a country's position as a commodities exporter or high
savings rates due to demographics -- and should be concluded by
the summer, with a first evaluation taking place before the end
of the year.
 The issue of protection includes measures which would allow
emerging Asian countries to unwind the trillions of dollars in
reserves they have accumulated, mostly since the Asian financial
crisis in the late 1990s. This could include stricter regulation
of destabilising international capital flows and the use of
larger and more easily accessible IMF credit lines to act as
safety nets.
 Finally, diversification means an attempt to shift away from
a reliance on the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency.
 A report submitted to Sarkozy on Friday by a group of
eminent economists -- including ex-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker and China's deputy central bank chief Hu Xiaolian --
backed French calls for a consideration of the longer-term use
of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as a reserve asset.
 Wider use of SDRs has received some support from Chinese
officials and some emerging countries like Brazil and Russia,
concerned that quantitive easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve
could fuel an asset bubble in developing economies.
 However, some G20 partners have dubbed France's plans
confusing and too far-reaching. U.S. President Barack Obama was
publicly silent on the issue at a meeting with Sarkozy in
Washington this month and the French leader said afterwards
there was no immediate replacement for the dollar as a reserve
currency.
 While French officials have played down hopes of a major
breakthrough this year, they say France could target the
establishment of a timeframe for China's yuan currency to enter
the basket of currencies underpinning SDRs, perhaps in a quid
pro quo for greater flexibility from Beijing.
 French officials say that Germany and Mexico, which takes up
the G20 baton in November, have been asked to lead working
groups on reform of the financial system.
 
 TACKLING VOLATLITY IN THE COMMODITIES MARKETS
 France supports the extension of G20 decisions on the
regulation of financial derivatives into the commodities market,
via something similar to the United States' Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) reforms.
 This could involve the registration of transactions in
centralised databases, the standardisation of contracts, the use
of a clearing house to settle transactions and the imposition of
maximum positions to prevent trading houses from cornering the
market in commodities.
 Paris also hopes to improve the dialogue between commodities
producing and consuming countries, particularly on cereals.
 On food security, France has suggested the international
community could coordinate better in response to crises,
possibly via regional stockpiles or more proactive responses
from international organisations like the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
 French sources cite scepticism from Saudi Arabia and China
about improving the scope and frequency of data on energy
reserves, for example. Saudi Arabia and Russia have been asked
to preside over working groups on raw materials.
 
 REFORMING GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
 Sarkozy has called for action to improve global economic
governance, promote development and address a ""democratic
deficit"" in some international organisations.
 The report submitted to Sarkozy on Friday by eminent
economists said the IMF had failed to meet its mandate of
guaranteeing exchange rate stability and the G20 had de facto
stepped into that role.
 The efficacy of the G20, the report said, could be improved
if it had a more formal institutional architecture and could
speak for all countries of the world using a constituency system
similar to the IMF and World Bank.
 However some countries, such as Japan, have expressed
opposition to France's suggestion of creating an institutional
structure for the G20 to smooth the transition between rotating
presidencies -- saying there is no need for another layer of
global governance.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2011 06:16PM ET</span>",France's Sarkozy to lay out ambitious G20 goals,"* Sarkozy to spell out agenda on commodities, monetary reform
 * Programme has been discussed with France's G20 partners
By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy will
spell out his plans for reforming the international monetary
system and curbing volatility in food and fuel prices on Monday
in a keynote speech on France's year-long G20 presidency.
 The address, billed as the official launch of his ambitious
agenda, will present the findings of whirlwind consultations
with G20 leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and
China's Hu Jintao on the three key areas of France's presidency.
 Seeking to capitalise on his G20 leadership to improve his
dire poll ratings at home, Sarkozy is expected to be most
specific about measures to tackle high commodities prices,
rather than his designs for overhauling the world's monetary
system and reforming global economic governance.
 A spike in world food prices to record highs in December has
pushed commodities up the G20 agenda. But Sarkozy appears to
have garnered scant foreign support for plans to wean the world
economy off its reliance on the U.S. dollar and establish a ""new
Bretton Woods"" system.
 Sarkozy is scheduled to deliver a 40 minute speech starting
at 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) that outlines France's priorities for the
year. After the address, he is expected to answer questions for
more than an hour.
 ""Everything he will put forward has been discussed with the
main partners,"" said a senior advisor to Sarkozy. ""These are not
solutions but some action points and objectives which G20
countries are ready to work on.""
 
 MORE TRANSPARENCY FOR COMMODITIES
 In recent weeks, French officials have played down hopes for
achieving a major breakthrough on monetary reform by the time
France's presidency concludes at a Cannes summit in November,
but they point to commodities as an area where much can be done.
 Sarkozy's conservative UMP party has strong roots in rural
France and the commodities theme is seen as a potential vote
winner in next year's presidential election.
 A poll on Sunday showed Sarkozy's approval rating
languishing near record lows at 30 percent.
 He is expected to discuss ways of making commodities and
energy markets more transparent -- including curbs on
derivatives -- and of improving data on output and inventories.
 On monetary reform, France's ruminations on the possibility
of giving the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing
Rights a role as a reserve currency have evoked a muted response
from emerging market partners and a stern silence from
Washington.
 French suggestions for creating a permanent institutional
framework for the G20, parallel to the IMF and World Bank, have
also failed to gain traction with some countries, like Japan,
openly opposed.
 Monday's speech to some 300 diplomats and journalists is
also due to touch on current issues such as last week's threats
against France by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the recent
crisis in Tunisia, where Paris was a long-time supporter of
ousted President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.

(Adds details) 
 BEIRUT, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Lebanon's Central Bank said on
Sunday it can ensure exchange rate and interest rate stability
despite a political crisis following the collapse of Prime
Minister Saad al-Hariri's government earlier this month.
 In a statement it said Central Bank governor Riad Salameh
""confirms that the policy of preserving the pound's exchange
rate remains ... and that the Central Bank is working normally
to ensure the liquidity of the Lebanese pound  and U.S.
dollar and to continue the stability in interest rates, and (it
confirms that the bank) is able to do that.""
 The statement was issued after Salameh met Hariri, who is
now caretaker premier, ahead of consultations on Monday to name
a prime minister to lead a new government.
 The Central Bank statement denied what it said were reports
that the meeting had been held at Salameh's urgent request,
saying the appointment had been fixed in advance.
 It said it had issued its statement because ""the current
political climate opens up scope for rumours, including those
relating to the stability of the exchange rate of the pound"".
 Caretaker Finance Minister Raya Hassan told Reuters last
week that economic growth and reforms could suffer if political
deadlock continues between Hariri and Hezbollah, which toppled
his government on Jan. 12 in a dispute over an indictment in the
2005 killing of Hariri's father.
 Lebanon's high foreign currency reserves, which amount to
around $31 billion, provide a significant line of defence for
Lebanon's exchange rate, which is set in a range between 1,501
and 1,514 pounds to the U.S. dollar.

government wants to deliver a comprehensive package soon to
strengthen the European rescue fund, the country's Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was quoted as saying on Sunday.
 ""We (the coalition) agree that we want to tie together a
complete package in the next weeks,"" the Sunday edition of
Tagesspiegel newspaper quoted Schaeuble as saying.
 ""We have to avoid that people have the feeling we are
stumbling from one crisis to the next,"" he added.
 Such a package would include measures to strengthen the
bloc's Stability and Growth pact and steps to improve
coordination of European economic policy, Schaeuble said.
 ""And of course it also includes designing the rescue fund so
that the EU share of 440 billion euros is actually available on
demand,"" Schaeuble said.
 Europe is discussing ways to beef up the EFSF rescue fund to
show it has enough firepower to support other states struggling
with their borrowings, hoping this will ease the region's debt
crisis.
 The fund has a headline value of 440 billion euros but an
effective lending capacity estimated at just 225 billion euros
because of the need to secure a triple-A credit rating.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and junior
coalition partners the Free Democrats have had their differences
about economic policy, but Schaeuble said there was no conflict
about this issue in the government.
 This weekend Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle was quoted as
saying the European rescue fund could offer bonds at different
interest rates to account for its members' divergent levels of
creditworthiness in its attempt to boost its lending capacity.
 Merkel's spokesman on Friday signalled it would consider the
option of getting euro zone countries that do not have an 'AAA'
rating to help boost the capacity of the EFSF by injecting cash.

(Combines stories, adds background)
 By Annika Breidthardt
 BERLIN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The European rescue fund could
offer bonds at different interest rates to account for its
members' divergent levels of credit worthiness in its attempt to
boost lending capacity, Germany's Economy Minister said.
 Raising debt at different rates would mean the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would not have to lift the
agreed headline sum, a step that has come up against ardent
opposition from euro zone member states, especially Germany.
""One could for instance work with different interest rates
within the EFSF,"" Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle was quoted
as saying in an interview with Die Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
 ""That means the individual credit tranches that the EFSF
borrows and passes on to the countries it helps could be raised
at different interest rate levels,"" Bruederle told the paper,
according to the pre-publication seen by Reuters on Saturday.
 ""Then one wouldn't have to change the volume.""
 Europe is discussing ways to beef up the EFSF rescue fund to
show it has enough firepower to support other states struggling
with their borrowings, hoping this will ease the region's debt
crisis.
 The fund has a headline value of 440 billion euros but an
effective lending capacity estimated at just 225 billion euros
because of the need to secure a triple-A credit rating. 
 The challenge is to boost it without raising the headline
sum, which would be difficult to sell politically to Germany's
parliament and public in particular, and for 'AAA'-rated
countries not to take more than their share of the burden.
 Germany said on Friday it would consider the option of
getting euro zone countries who do not have an 'AAA' rating to
help boost the capacity of the EFSF by injecting cash.
 
 NO TABOOS
 Making the total agreed amount available is a prerequisite
in proposals to buy back the bonds of troubled member states,
something Eurogroup chief Jean-Claude Juncker said European
leaders should not shy away from.
 ""It would be wrong to create taboos but we cannot
overstretch the strong countries,"" Juncker said in an interview
with German magazine Der Spiegel seen ahead of publication. 
 Der Spiegel magazine also reported in an unsourced reported
that the idea of a buy-back, which it said was first raised by
the European rescue fund's chief Klaus Regling, had been greeted
with sympathy by euro zone finance ministers this week.
 Without citing sources, Der Spiegel said Regling's
suggestion stood good chances of becoming reality at a European
Council meeting in March.
 It also cited an unnamed high-ranking German finance
ministry source as saying this was a good idea, running counter
to official German denials this week.
 Greece and Germany have insisted Greece, the first to
succumb in the currency bloc's debt crisis, needed no help with
debt repayments. A spokesman for Regling declined comment.
 Under the proposal being discussed, the EFSF would conduct
buy-back operations of bonds of a distressed country, which
could help stabilise its debt market, Reuters sources have said.
 
 DIFFERENT VALUE
 Credit guarantees and pledges of callable or contingency
capital from top-rated countries like Germany are valued by the
ratings agencies at 100 percent in the fund. But such pledges
for lower-rated countries face a discount.
 To give investors an incentive to buy beyond the sum
guaranteed by the top countries, one could offer higher interest
rates on those pledges, according to Bruederle's proposal.
 Six of the 17 countries in the bloc are triple A: Austria,
Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. 
 Of the rest, Greece and Ireland have both tapped emergency
help while Portugal and Spain are under pressure, leaving just a
few economies that might be in a position to help, including
Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone. 
 Bruederle also said Europe's fiscal policy should be better
aligned but added he was against a European economic government.
 ""We don't want the same tax rates in each euro country. But
we do want that the advantages in competitiveness in one country
are not paid by the tax payer in another,"" he said.
 ""A European debt brake in the national constitutions would
also be good,"" Bruederle added. 
 The debt brake law, which came into effect at the beginning
of 2011, stipulates that Germany has to cut its structural
deficit to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product by 2016.

 NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
above $1.36 on Friday on hopes the euro zone will find a
durable solution for its debt crisis, while world stocks gained
as robust GE earnings foreshadowed a stronger U.S. economy.
 European banking shares jumped on Spain's plan to partially
take over its weakest saving banks. Coupled with expectations
of a strengthened euro zone rescue fund, the plan to save
Spanish banks helped ease tensions over the European crisis.

 ""Markets are clearly buying into the view that the European
debt crisis is being resolved with modest pain,"" said Steven
Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup in New York.
 The euro strengthened for the fourth consecutive session,

major currencies, according to the U.S. dollar index <.DXY>.
Against the Japanese yen, the greenback  was down 0.51
percent at 82.56.
 GE SUPPORTS DOW
 World stocks rallied after two sessions of losses as
General Electric Co , the largest U.S. conglomerate,
reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and its
first rise in overall revenue since late 2008.
 GE shares jumped 5.6 percent on the New York Stock
Exchange, accounting for the largest portion of gains of the
Dow industrials.
 But Google Inc  erased early gains to finish 2.38
percent lower, one day after reporting stronger-than-expected

 NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
above $1.36 on Friday and its break of important technical
levels suggested more gains to come now that anxiety about a
euro zone debt crisis has started to wane.
 The euro has outperformed the dollar in eight of the last
10 sessions, and Friday's breach of $1.3570 took it above the
50 percent retracement of its November-to-January slide. It was
last up 1 percent at $1.3615 .
 Traders said a solid break of $1.36 would target the
100-week moving average at $1.3640 and then $1.3736, the 61.8
percent retracement of a decline that started when the euro was
above $1.42 in November.
 ""Markets are clearly buying into the view that the European
debt crisis is being resolved with modest pain,"" said Steven
Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup in New York.
 The euro also hit a five-week high around 112.49 yen after
a break above a closely watched Japanese technical indicator
around 112 yen , with a close above there seen as
bullish. The dollar slipped 0.5 percent to 82.55 yen .
 Recent strong debt auctions in Spain and Portugal and talk
that officials were considering letting a European rescue fund
purchase government debt from troubled euro zone countries
heartened investors, narrowing euro zone credit spreads and
boosting European bank shares along with the euro.
 NOT A SURE BET
 Few investors expect the Federal Reserve, which meets next
week, to alter its commitment to loose monetary policy or its
plan to buy $600 billion in Treasury debt by mid-2011.
 The European Central Bank, by contrast, recently warned of
rising euro zone price pressures, sparking speculation that it
could lift lending rates before the Fed does. Traders said that
could add to euro momentum next week.
 UK inflation is above the Bank of England's target, though
policymaker Adam Posen said that a rate hike wasn't necessarily
imminent. Sterling  rose 0.6 percent to $1.6008.
 To be sure, after rising more than 4 percent against the
dollar since Jan. 10, the euro may be due for a correction.
 Data showed speculators in the latest week were positioned
in favor of the euro for the first time in two months, which
could set up some profit-taking next week. For details, see

 Then there are the lingering debt uncertainties.
 ""The situation in Europe is still largely unresolved,"" said
Jason Polit, an analyst at Charles Schwab Private Client in
Phoenix. ""Some sort of bailout for one or more of the
peripheral economies will likely occur eventually and that will
put downward pressure the euro.""
 Investors have worried about debt levels in Spain and
Portugal, with the latter often tagged as likely to require a
bailout similar to those extended to Greece and Ireland.
 However, Spanish government bond yields fell Friday, with
the spread over German Bunds narrowing to its tightest since
mid-November, and Portuguese bond spreads also narrowed.
 Polit, who manages around $235 million in assets for

allocations in emerging markets and focusing more on developed
markets with manageable debt levels, such as Germany.
""It is best to stay guarded with so many questions still

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a two-month
high against the U.S. dollar on Friday in a leap past key
technical resistance that may extend its two-week-long rally on
waning fears over Europe's debt crisis.
 Expectations of a strengthened euro zone rescue fund and a
strong German Ifo business confidence report supported the
euro, along with a more hawkish outlook from the European
Central Bank recently.
 The euro breached the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement at
around $1.3570, hitting session highs at $1.3577 on electronic
trading platform EBS. It was last at $1.3576, up 0.7 percent.
 The single currency, which outperformed the dollar in eight
of the past 10 sessions, was buoyed by Asian sovereign demand,
improving confidence in the euro zone, and a
stronger-than-expected German Ifo survey..
 Traders said the market is now focused on taking out the
$1.3600 options barrier.
 ""Markets are clearly buying into the view that the European
debt crisis is being resolved with modest pain,"" said Steve
Englander, head of G10 strategy at CitiFX in New York.
 The euro's gains are justified given how bank equity
prices, credit spreads and rate differentials have moved, he
said.
 ""If anything the euro move may be somewhat on the modest
side,"" he said. ""It also seems that many investors were caught
(as we were) by the sudden shift in investor sentiment, but
there is nothing inconsistent in the euro move given this
improvement.""
 The surge in the euro versus the dollar coincided with the
rise of the euro zone common currency against sterling after
Bank of England policymaker Adam Posen -- a known dove among
BoE policymakers -- said the fact that the market was pricing
in rate increases did not mean they would occur. For more see.
 The euro's rally helped to knock the dollar index down 0.7
percent to 78.296, a two-month low.
 Against the yen, the dollar lost 0.4 percent to 82.62 yen.
 But, not everyone contends the euro is safe right now.
 NOT A SURE BET
 Jason Polit, a certified financial analyst at Charles
Schwab Private Client in Phoenix, said the strength of the euro
has been based on confidence rather than tangible resolutions
to the euro zone's debt crisis, leaving the euro vulnerable.
 ""The situation in Europe is still largely unresolved,"" he
said. ""Some sort of bailout for one or more of the peripheral
economies will likely occur eventually and that will put
downward pressure the euro.""
 Polit, who manages around $235 million in assets for
clients, said he has rebalanced portfolios, reducing
allocations in emerging markets and focusing more on developed
markets with manageable debt levels, such as Germany.
 ""It is best to stay guarded with so many questions still
unanswered about the euro zone,"" he said.
 The euro rose to five-week highs around 112.24 yen, making
a technical break above a closely watched Japanese indicator,
the Ichimoku cloud, in the 112 yen area. A daily close above
the cloud would give the euro potential to rally further.
 The euro has gained nearly 1.5 percent against the dollar
since the start of year, driven by growing expectations euro
zone policymakers will arrive at a more durable solution to the
peripheral debt crisis and a hawkish ECB which last week warned
about price pressures.
 Still, doubts remain whether the euro can hold gains.
 ""This euro reaction seems overdone as it's highly unlikely
the ECB will raise rates soon and there's been nothing concrete
on the rescue fund,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.
 ""We think Portugal will have to be bailed out eventually.
After that the euro can rise further as Spain we believe is
solvent, but the euro rally is not sustainable here,"" he
added.
 Spain is planning to force its regional savings banks to
become conventional banks and seek stock market listings, a
source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
 Spanish government bond yields fell, with the spread over
German Bunds narrowing to its tightest since mid-November,
while Portuguese bond spreads also came in.

(Updates with statement on Inter Rao)
 By Alexei Anishchuk
 MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai
invited Russia on Friday to rebuild Soviet-era facilities in
Afghanistan, courting a nation eager to expand its influence
decades after the Soviet Union's costly war there.
 ""We want to give a new start to vital projects that were
begun very long ago,"" Karzai, on his second visit to Moscow in
six months, said at a news conference with President Dmitry
Medvedev after their talks in the Kremlin.
 The leaders issued a joint declaration in which Russia
expressed its readiness to participate in ""priority economic
projects"" in Afghanistan, some dating back to the Soviet era.
 The projects included the Salang Tunnel in the Hindu Kush
mountains, hydroelectric power facilities in Kabul and Baglan
provinces, a customs terminal and a university in Kabul.
 Neither the declaration nor the leaders mentioned the cost
or potential terms. Russia has said it would rebuild Soviet-era
infrastructure in Afghanistan provided the international
community underwrote the cost.
 The declaration expressed support for Russian involvement in
a proposed gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to India via
Afghanistan and Pakistan, subject to other countries' approval.
 Ex-Soviet Turkmenistan, eager to lessen reliance on
long-dominant gas buyer Russia, has been cool toward Russian
participation.
 Russia is seeking to increase its influence in Afghanistan,
where Soviet forces fought a nearly decade-long war in the
1980s.
 Karzai, whose country is eyeing the eventual withdrawal of
U.S. and NATO forces after their own decade-long war against the
Taliban, said he wants to step up ties with Moscow.
 ""Russia is a great power,"" Karzai said in a speech at
Russia's Academy of Sciences. ""For us, Russia is ... a teacher.""
 Moscow has ruled out sending troops to Afghanistan, where
some 15,000 Soviet soldiers died fighting mujahideen insurgents
before pulling out in 1989.
 With the Afghan government expected to take the lead in
security nationwide by the end of 2014, Medvedev said Moscow
would continue to help train and equip Afghan forces and provide
transit routes for NATO.
 Russia will hold talks with the United States next month on
plans for the sale of 21 Mi-17 helicopters for use in
Afghanistan, Russian foreign ministry official Zamir Kabulov
said on the sidelines of the Kremlin meetings.
 In a separate meeting, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said his country would invest $500 million in the Central
Asia-South Asia (CASA) 1000 electricity project if Russian
utility Inter RAO is selected as its operator.
 ""If our company Inter RAO is granted the right to be the
operator, we can join in the construction of the high-voltage
CASA 1000 transmission line,"" Putin said.
 The project is designed to transmit electricty from
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to South Asia.

 * Export restrictions major factor in food crises
 * Food aid should be exempted
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Export restrictions are a prime
cause of current and recent surges in global food prices, and
countries should find other ways to secure domestic supplies,
the head of the World Trade Organization said on Saturday.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said that only a few years
after the 2008 food crisis, rising prices were stoking global
inflation and fomenting political unrest in several countries.
 Two weeks ago the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) said its food price index had reached a
record high in 2010, exceeding 2008 levels when rising food
prices prompted riots in a number of countries.
 Lamy said that one factor this time was bad weather, for
instance last year's drought in Russia and its Black Sea
neighbours.
 But export restrictions played a major role in food crises,
and some people considered them the main cause of the 2008 price
rise, he told a conference of agriculture ministers in Berlin.
""Export restrictions lead to panic in markets when different
actors see prices rising at stellar speed,"" Lamy said.
For instance there was no fundamental imbalance in the
market for rice in 2007-2008 but international trade in the crop
fell by seven percent in 2008 from record 2007 levels largely
because of export restrictions, he said.
 Rising prices for cereals in 2010-2011 have much to do with
export restrictions in Russia and Ukraine, imposed after both
countries were hit by drought, he said.
 Such restrictions hurt importing countries and can prevent
the World Food Programme from acquiring the food it needs to
help starving people.
 Lamy said countries imposing restrictions were driven by the
need to prevent their own populations starving, but there were
other ways of achieving this goal.
 ""The answer to that question must reside in more food
production globally, more social safety nets, and more food aid
and possibly food reserves,"" he said.
 ""I would argue that what we must at least explore is the
exemption of humanitarian food aid from export bans.""
 WTO rules allow members to curb or ban food exports to
ensure their own food supplies, and efforts by Japan in 2008 to
make it harder for countries to restrict exports found little
support.
 But Lamy said the long-running Doha round to free up world
trade could help remove other barriers to commerce in food, for
instance by reducing rich-world subsidies that have hurt poor
countries' production capacity and banning export subsidies
entirely, and bringing down some tariffs.
 ""Globally, what we would be likely to see as a result of
Doha is more food being produced where this can be done more
efficiently,"" he said.
 WTO members have launched a renewed push to conclude the
nine-year-old Doha round this year. In agriculture they spent
the last week largely looking at technical issues needed to
implement a deal, and looking at proposals on subsidies.

 * Commission refuses to amend proposed feed-only approach
 * Dutch raise new GM contamination concern for EU imports
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A majority of European Union
countries want to allow tiny traces of genetically modified (GM)
material in food imports for human consumption, according to an
internal EU briefing paper seen by Reuters on Friday.
 In October, the European Commission proposed new rules that
would allow up to 0.1 percent of unapproved GM material in
imports of animal feed to the bloc but excluded human food from
the scope of the rule change.
 ""While the current draft is limited to feed, a majority of
member states indicated that they would welcome an extension of
the scope to food,"" the EU briefing paper written for Commission
and government officials stated.
 ""In addition, there is a clear demand from operators of the
food and feed chain to cover all these products,"" Commission
experts said in the document.
 The draft legislation, which must first be approved by EU
states and lawmakers, is meant to avoid a repeat of disruption
to EU animal feed supplies in 2009, when U.S. soy cargoes were
blocked after traces of unapproved GM material were found.
 Countries advocating the inclusion of human food in the new
rules, such as major exporters the United States, Brazil and
Argentina, say a feed-only approach is unworkable because global
grain supplies cannot easily be separated into food and feed.
 But even with a majority of EU states in favour of including
food imports, the Commission will not amend its proposal, one
official told Reuters. That would force governments to either
accept or reject the feed-only approach when they vote on the
plans in Brussels on Feb. 8 and 9.
 Once the current proposals are approved, the Commission is
ready to draft fresh legislation covering food imports in future
if required, the Commission official added.
 
 DUTCH CONCERNS
 The current draft legislation would only apply to GM
products that have been approved in the exporting country and
for which an EU marketing approval is pending.
 But the Dutch government has said that the 0.1 percent
tolerance margin should also cover GMOs for which there is no EU
approval pending, provided they have been assessed and cleared
for sale by a non-EU country.
 ""The Netherlands' preference is that the scope of the
proposal should include all GMOs that are permitted in a third
country outside the EU,"" said a letter seen by Reuters from the
country's state secretary for agriculture to Dutch members of
parliament.
 The move is backed by EU rice importers, who warn that new
GM varieties being developed in India and China and not intended
for export to Europe will not be submitted for EU marketing
approval but that traces still will inevitably enter the global
food chain.
 ""The reality is that countries around the world are pushing
ahead with GM rice, and we are part of a global market and
reliant on rice imports,"" said Chris Downes of the Federation of
European Rice Millers.
 ""This is not a problem for other countries, it is a problem
for the EU, and the EU must be the one taking the initiative to
find solutions. At the moment, this is unfortunately not
happening,"" he added.

song writers and the industry by simplifying the current system.
 In recent years, music labels and publishers have worked
hard to license their music on an array of platforms including
mobile networks, mobile handsets, websites, Internet service
providers and pay-TV groups.
 The long, complex process makes it difficult for many new
services to get off the ground, as a new offering has to sign
licensing agreements with the many groups that hold the
recording rights and the music publishing rights.
 Within publishing -- the part of the business that makes
money every time a song is played on the radio, in adverts,
films or online -- payments have to go to all the song writers
on each track. One song can have many writers and they are often
all signed to different publishers.
 A service that operates in different countries would also
need to agree terms with the royalty collection societies of
each country it operates in, making for a very tangled affair. 
 However there is currently no database or central point
showing which publisher or song writer unequivocally owns which
rights, meaning it is hard to know where to start.
 Now, consultancy Deloitte is working to develop a global
repertoire database (GRD) for the publishing industry following
input from Universal Music Publishing and EMI Publishing, some
of the major royalty collection societies and retailers such as
Amazon and iTunes.
 The groups were asked by the European Commission to look
into the issue. 
 ""As an industry there have been many false dawns over the
years but at last we seem to have woken up to the fact that we
have to change,"" Neil Gaffney, Executive Vice President at EMI
Music Publishing UK told Reuters.
 ""This GRD is a game changer because for the first time we
will have an assured, common, trusted view of what we represent,
own and manage.
 ""One of the complexities for a new services is people say
they didn't know who to pay. It gets rid of one of the
fundamental issues and means we can turn our attention to those
people who use music illegally.""
 Deloitte partner Neil Allcock said they hoped elements of
the database would be up and running very quickly, and aim to be
fully functional within 18 months to 2 years. A similar project
is also being looked at for the recorded music business.

 * Admits sterling weakness vs euro could pose CPI risks
 * Says market expectations for early UK hike may be wrong
 
 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker Adam
Posen said on Friday he still believed UK inflation would fall
below target in the medium term but admitted there were risks
from sterling's weakness against a stronger euro.
 His comments gave no clear indication whether he will
reiterate his call for more quantitative easing, or whether he
will rejoin the majority of the BoE policymakers in voting to
keep policy unchanged.
 ""There could be sufficient growth in demand abroad --
positive surprises abroad, particularly in the euro area, our
major trading partner -- that could influence not just demand
for U.K. goods and services, but also the exchange rate,"" he
told Bloomberg News.
 Posen said that he was closely watching these factors, but
currently did not think they were strong enough to offset his
previous view that spare capacity in Britain's economy would
push inflation below the BoE's 2 percent target.
 ""In terms of underlying UK inflation, driven by domestic
forces, my position is unchanged,"" Posen said.
 Sterling dipped against the euro immediately after the
comments, but subsequently recovered its poise.
 Posen broke ranks with fellow members of the Monetary Policy
Committee last October when he argued that further stimulus was
needed to ward off the threat of a prolonged period of economic
weakness.
 Since then, inflation data in Britain has surprised to the
upside and a strong rally in oil and commodity prices has fanned
concerns that the BoE may have lost its grip on inflation.
 ""In terms of external inflation pressures he is conceding
that there could be more upside risks,"" said Philip Shaw, UK
economist at Investec.
 ""We've not really heard him emphasise that side of the story
before very much. But there doesn't seem to be any fundamental
change in his medium-term position. Given that being the case,
he probably still sought further QE in January's meeting.""
 Inflation was at least a percentage point above target
throughout 2010 and looks set to hit 4 percent early this year,
more than double the BoE's target.
 In the past two months there has been a radical shift in
market expectations of future interest rate rises. Investors,
which in November were betting UK rates would stay at 0.5
percent throughout 2011, are now betting on two quarter-point
rate rises by December.
 Posen, however, warned that market expectations were not
necessarily fulfilled.
 ""Just because the markets price in a rate increase or a rate
cut at any time doesn't necessarily mean it will occur,""
Posen said. 
 ""If the markets make a move and it lasts for a while, it has
an impact on the economy and we take that into account in the
forecast,"" he said. ""Short-term movements in the gilt market do
not always predict what actually comes out of the MPC.""

 NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied on Friday
as robust GE earnings foreshadowed a stronger U.S. economy,
while the euro jumped above $1.35 on hopes the euro zone will

 Spain's plan to partially take over its weakest saving

the sovereign,"" Nixon said, adding that Madrid's plan is also
""contributing to a markedly more positive environment for the

 * Imports not yet fully recovered
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - World exports have finally topped
levels last seen before the financial crisis that started in
2008, giving a further sign of global economic recovery, figures
from the Dutch CPB research institute showed on Friday.
 The credit crunch and subsequent recession led to the
biggest slump in world trade since World War Two. Trade volumes
began to recover in mid-2009 and grew strongly in 2010 as firms
rebuilt inventories and took advantage of the economic upturn.
 The institute's latest world trade monitor showed that its
index of global merchandise exports, set at 100 in the year
2000, had reached 164.1 in November 2010 -- above the previous
high of 163.6 in April 2008.
 Global imports have still not regained pre-crisis levels so
the overall level of world trade has not yet fully recovered
ground lost in the crisis. The sum of global imports and exports
should be the same, but statistical differences in different
countries often lead to a disparity.
 The institute, whose data are used by the World Bank and
European Commission, said the average increase in global trade
volumes in the three months ended November had been 1.0 percent,
up from 0.2 percent in the three months to October.
 This increase in the rate of change in the statistically
smoothed figures, known as momentum, was the first since January
2010, it said.
 If continued, this would suggest that trade -- and hence the
world economy as a whole -- is beginning to pick up again. The
recovery had slowed down in recent months with the completion of
the initial wave of inventory-building.
 Looking at the more volatile monthly figures, world trade
volume increased by 2.3 percent in November from October, after
an upwardly revised 1.0 percent rise in October.
 That largely reflected a surge in trade flows in and out of
emerging economies, whose imports jumped 5.1 percent in the
month, with the strongest growth in Asia.

 * Proposal change welcomed by IETA, opposing EU states
 
 (Adds market reaction, detail)
 By Nina Chestney and Pete Harrison
 LONDON/BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The European Commission
will ban the most common type of carbon offsets, mostly from
China and India, for use in the EU emissions trading scheme (EU
ETS) from the start of May 2013, it said on Friday.
 ""Essentially, the ban means that companies will be able to
use these credits for 2012 compliance under the EU ETS until
April 30, 2013, but not thereafter,"" the Commission said in a
statement.
 Under the scheme, the emissions of power plants and
factories are capped and carbon permits are traded between
participants.
 In an unrelated development, the Commission on Wednesday
halted spot trade on the EU ETS for one week to improve security
after the theft from national carbon registries, at least partly
by computer hackers, of emissions permits worth up to 30 million
euros ($40.6 million).
 A committee made up of representatives from the 27-nation
bloc voted on Friday in favour of the ban that would block
factories and power plants from meeting emissions targets by
paying for cuts in greenhouse gases from big industrial projects
in China and India.
 The Commission originally proposed that from Jan. 1, 2013 it
should exclude from its scheme offsets from the potent
greenhouse gas hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide
credits from the production of adipic acid, an industrial
chemical used to produce nylon.
 The projects have drawn criticism for awarding excessive
profits and crowding out others, such as projects favouring
renewable energy.
 The offsets, called certified emissions reductions (CERs),
are generated under a U.N. scheme, which rewards companies
investing in clean energy projects in developing countries. A
certain number of CERs can be used to comply with the EU's
emissions targets in the ETS.
 The benchmark CER contract rose nearly 0.50 percent to 11.00
euros ($14.89) a tonne at 1417 GMT.
 An earlier Commission statement, saying the ban would start
in January 2013, was made in error, but prompted a 10 per cent
spike in the price of CERs for 2013 delivery.
 LOBBYING
 Some EU countries, such as Italy, Germany, France, Britain
and Poland, had lobbied hard for the start date to be pushed
back to May 2013 or later, under pressure from energy firms who
wanted to protect their investments.
 Companies were worried that a January ban would make carbon
offsets dated from 2012 invalid, as most do not submit
allowances until the following April, in 2013 in this case.
 A May start date would allow around 30 million to 40 million
extra offsets to be used for compliance, according to analysts.
 Those who had lobbied for the postponement welcomed the
change of date.
 ""The change of entry into force (...) will allow market
participants to honour contracts for delivery of offsets even in
the face of U.N. issuance delays,"" the International Emissions
Trading Association said in a statement.
 Both Italy and Britain said the compromise decision was an
improvement on the original proposal.
 However, environmental group CDM Watch said it was
unfortunate that member states bowed to pressure from investors.
 ""Delaying the entry into force of the ban will open the door
to an additional 52 million credits, equating to 676 million
euros,"" said Natasha Hurley, CDM Watch EU Policy Advisor.
 The European Parliament now has three months to comment on
the proposal, after which the Commission will formally adopt it.

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The euro jumped to a two-month
high against the U.S. dollar on Friday, driven by Asian
sovereign demand and improving confidence in the euro zone, but
its two-week-long rally could prove fleeting as it nears key
technical resistance.
 Expectations of a strengthened euro zone rescue fund and a
strong German Ifo business confidence report supported the
euro, along with a more hawkish outlook from the European
Central Bank recently, but debt concerns still weighed.
 The euro, which outperformed the dollar in eight of the
past 10 sessions, hit a two-month high of $1.3569 on trading
platform EBS, boosted by a stronger-than-expected German Ifo
survey. [ID:nBAE003872].
 It broke past option barriers at $1.3550, though it eased a
bit and was last at $1.3543, up 0.5 percent on the day.
rally further.
 The euro's rally helped to knock the dollar index down 0.5
percent to 78.418 , not far from a two-month low of
78.303 hit on Wednesday.
 Against the yen, the dollar also lost 0.3 percent to 82.70
yen .
 Jason Polit, a certified financial analyst at Charles
Schwab Private Client in Phoenix, said the strength of the euro
has been based on confidence rather than tangible resolutions
to the euro zone's debt crisis, leaving the euro vulnerable.
 ""The situation in Europe is still largely unresolved,"" he
said. ""Some sort of bailout for one or more of the peripheral
economies will likely occur eventually and that will put
downward pressure the euro.""
 Polit, who manages assets around $235 million for clients,
said they have rebalanced portfolios, reducing allocations in
emerging markets and focusing more on developed markets with
manageable debt levels, such as Germany.
 ""It is best to stay guarded with so many questions still
unanswered about the euro zone,"" he said.
 Traders said major Asian sovereign accounts were also
active in driving the euro higher, while the focus was on a key
technical level at $1.3576, the 50 percent retracement of the
euro's fall from November to January.
 The euro rose to five-week highs around 112.24 yen
, making a technical break above a closely watched
Japanese indicator, the Ichimoku cloud, in the 112 yen area. A
daily close above the cloud would give the euro potential to
rally further.
 Despite sharp currency moves, implied volatilities, which
may reflect the market's overall sentiment, remained subdued
on Friday. Front-end euro/dollar volatility  on Friday
stayed pinned on the 12 percent handle, trading at 12.10, a
touch softer from Thursday.
 One-month implied vols on dollar/yen , were little
changed at 9.95 percent and traders said there were very little
flows in the currency pair. But vol trading should become more
active, traders said, if dollar/yen breaks above 84 yen.
 The euro has gained more than 1 percent against the dollar
since the start of year, driven by growing expectations that
euro zone policymakers will arrive at a more durable solution
to the peripheral debt crisis and a hawkish ECB which last week
warned about price pressures.
 Still, doubts remained whether the euro could hold gains.
 ""This euro reaction seems overdone as it's highly unlikely
the ECB will raise rates soon and there's been nothing concrete
on the rescue fund,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.
 ""We think Portugal will have to be bailed out eventually.
After that the euro can rise further as Spain we believe is
solvent, but the euro rally is not sustainable here,"" he
added.
 Spain is planning to force its regional savings banks to
become conventional banks and seek stock market listings, a
source familiar with the matter told Reuters. [ID:nLDE70K0A4]
 ""Our core view continues to be that we will see rapid
shifts in sentiment towards the EUR, which will cause ongoing
volatility, but that EUR will close 2011 at higher levels than
it is currently trading at,"" said Camilla Sutton, chief
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Spanish government bond yields fall, with the spread over
German Bunds narrowing to its tightest since mid-November,
while Portuguese bond spreads also came in.

issue a confidential final ruling on Jan. 31 concerning European
claims that Boeing benefited from unfair aircraft subsidies,
sources familar with the case said on Friday.
 The report, which will not be made public for several weeks,
is the latest round of legal ping-pong between the European
Union and United States over mutual claims their aircraft
industries have been unfairly shielded from competition.
 The EU claimed victory after a confidential interim report
found in September that Airbus rival Boeing had received several
billion dollars of aid, but the two sides disagreed publicly
over the severity of the judgment.
 That ruling followed WTO condemnation last June of illegal
European subsidies for Airbus, mostly in the form of government
launch-aid loans. These findings came in an earlier case brought
by the United States, which is now the subject of appeal.
 The transatlantic subsidy row is the biggest bilateral
dispute ever at the Geneva-based trade body.
 The final report on the EU case against the United States
was expected to be distributed to the parties late afternoon
Geneva time on Jan. 31, the sources said.
 The WTO declined to comment.

 AMSTERDAM, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Sales of agricultural products
from the Netherlands, Europe's largest exporter of flowers and
dairy produce, recovered last year to exceed levels seen before
the 2008 crisis, the government said on Friday. 
 Dutch agricultural exports rose 8.7 percent year-on-year in
2010 to 65.8 billion euros ($89 billion), helping to boost the
country's total exports to 370 billion euros and widen its trade
surplus from 35.4 billion to 40 billion, the government said.
 ""Agricultural trade has recovered spectacularly. It's
fantastic that our fruit, vegetables, flowers, meat and dairy
are so much in demand in stores worldwide,"" Henk Bleker,
agriculture and foreign trade minister, said in a statement.
 Growing demand from emerging markets, led by China, resulted
in a surge in global food trading volumes and helped boost the
Netherlands' export-driven economy.
""After the United States, the Netherlands is the largest
exporter of agricultural products,"" the statement said.
 U.S. farm exports are forecast at a record $126.5 billion in
fiscal year 2011, an increase of $17.8 billion from a year ago,
with Asia accounting for more than half the rise. Brazil is also
gearing up for a bumper year that could exceed $75 billion.
 For the Netherlands, the European Union, whose farm
subsidies are a bone of contention in world trade talks,
dominates as a trading partner, taking 80 percent of Dutch
agricultural exports.
 Neighbouring Germany is the largest market for the Dutch,
taking 26 percent of their agricultural exports in 2010 as its
appetite for their flowers and plants, milk, eggs and meat
picked up. 
 Germany is also the largest food exporter to the
Netherlands, accounting for 19 percent of its agricultural
imports.
 Total Dutch agricultural imports in 2010 were up 7.7 percent
to 40.4 billion euros.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2011 09:56AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Uneasy over inflation," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Investors may be forced to
rethink investment strategies that centre on the rosy prospect
of low inflation as key central banks look set to renew pledges
to print money in the coming week.
 Outperformance of developed market assets relative to their
oversubscribed emerging counterparts this year partly reflects a
sentiment shift for investors, who are becoming uneasy about
inflation in the rapidly growing developing world and an as-yet
muted policy response.
 Price pressures are becoming increasingly observable even in
developed economies. UK inflation hit an 8-month high of 3.7
percent last month, prompting investors to price in a rate hike
by mid-year.
 Higher energy prices have pushed euro zone inflation to 2.2
percent, above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target.
 But there's nothing to suggest these central banks will
tighten monetary conditions aggressively. 
 The Fed and Bank of Japan are expected to stick to their
quantitative easing policies when they meet in the coming week
while the Bank of England minutes are likely to reveal no change
in its promise to keep its asset purchasing programme on
standby.
 Even the ECB, whose President Jean-Claude Trichet has warned
of price pressures, is unlikely to raise rates immediately.
 However, further price pressures may challenge the investor
perception interest rates would remain at current low levels for
a foreseeable future -- which could in turn hit equities.
 ""You don't have runaway inflation expectations. No one
expects the ECB to be very aggressive. With this golden period
of no interest rate rises, investors have no choice but to buy
risky assets, exactly what central banks are engineering us to
do,"" said Gary Baker, head of European equity strategy at BofA
Merrill Lynch.
 ""But if there were anything to challenge the U.S... rates
outlook, that may be a signal to start to get cautious on
positions.""
 A net 72 percent of fund managers polled by BofA Merrill
Lynch this month expected higher inflation in the next 12
months, the highest reading in almost 5 years. 
 At the same time, they have pushed back expectations for the
first Federal Reserve rate rise well into 2012.

 DM SURPRISE
 World stocks on a MSCI measure have risen more than 1
percent so far this year, adding to their gain of 10 percent
last year. Their emerging market counterparts lost 1.3 percent,
having risen 16 percent in 2010. 
 The emerging MSCI index was on track for its biggest weekly
drop in nearly two months in the past week.
 ""2010 was the story of EM doing well and it will continue to
do well, but a surprise in 2011 will be major economies picking
up,"" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency management at
Investec.
 He expects the ECB, BoE and Fed to raise rates this year.
 ""With world growth picking up and commodity prices rising,
inflationary pressures will surprise to the upside, we're
already seeing signs of that. They will start raising rates.""
 Stocks in India and Indonesia have come under pressure in
recent sessions as investors grew concerned that monetary
authorities may be behind the curve in tackling inflation.
 In Turkey, which shocked markets by cutting interest rates
on Thursday, concerns about inflation pushed benchmark yields
to their highest level since early December over the past week.
Local stocks fell nearly two percent this month, underperforming
the benchmark MSCI emerging index.
The BofA survey showed investors are trimming EM risks as a
rise in inflation became a headwind for equities.
 Respondents sharply cut their overweight positions on
emerging economies to a net 43 percent from 56 percent in
December, although the region remained as the most popular.
 At the same time, they turned most positive on U.S. equities
since late 2008 with a net 27 percent of respondents overweight.
 Going forward, outperformance of U.S. and other developed
markets may have further to run as investors will regard
inflationary pressures in developed economies -- as long as they
stay mild -- as incentives to buy risky assets with cheap
valuations.
 ""The pattern of performance across markets... suggests it
has been driven by a clear and substantial upgrade to U.S.
growth prospects,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.
 ""Globally, our core view is more positive in 2011 than in
2010, with accelerating U.S. and global growth through the year
and -- at the global level at least -- a still-easy policy
stance.""

 * At least one more board members to step down at year-end
 * Economist says adds to uncertainty on policy going forward
 
 (Adds background, analyst comment)
 STOCKHOLM, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank said on
Friday its first deputy governor, seen as a hawk, will step down
at the end of 2011 when his term expires, adding to uncertainty
over monetary policy after the turn of the year.
 The bank said First Deputy Governor Svante Oberg, widely
seen as one of the most hawkish members of the Riksbank's
six-member executive board, had notified the bank he will not
stand for re-election to the body and would leave the bank.
 The turn of the year will bring more changes to the Riksbank
as Deputy Governor Lars Nyberg has also said he will step down
then as his term expires.
 Governor Stefan Ingves' first term expires at the same time,
although he has not said whether he will stand for a second one.
 With Sweden weathering the financial crisis better than
most, the Riksbank embarked in July on a gradual tightening of
monetary policy to cap inflation, and forecasts further rate
hikes. But the board has been split in all four decisions to
raise.
 ""There will be a degree of uncertainty now that at least two
new board members are going to be appointed next year,"" SEB
economist Elisabet Kopelman said. 
 ""Given that we have a board that is already split, it
creates uncertainty about the direction of policy after this
year,"" she said.
 Kopelman said the resignation of Oberg, a member of the

 (Adds quotes, background)
 By Sarah Marsh and Christina Amann
 BERLIN, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Inflation risks accelerating to
between 4 and 6 percent in Germany by 2013/14, fuelled by
exploding commodity prices and high liquidity, the head of the
German BGA trade association told Reuters on Friday.
 The European Central Bank (ECB) should therefore raise its
interest rates as soon as possible, BGA President Anton Boerner
said in an interview, but will not because this would exacerbate
the crisis in some euro zone states.
 ""I expect a significant increase in inflation in the second
half of the year, an imported inflation due to the explosion in
commodity prices and the fact that we have a huge glut of
liquidity which in turn fuels those prices,"" Boerner said.
 ""An inflation rate in the next few years, by around 2013/14,
of somewhere between 4 and 6 percent is perhaps realistic.""
 This would be a sizeable jump from now, with German consumer
price inflation running at 1.7 percent in December.
 However, data on Thursday showed producer price inflation in
Germany leapt above 5 percent last month, prompting European
central bankers to stress the need to keep a close eye on price
pressures. [ID:nBZNJCE76D] [ID:nLDE70J093]
 ""We have a very problematic situation for the ECB, because
Germany is growing very strongly and interest rates should be
raised as soon as possible for Germany,"" he said.
 ""But it cannot do that because then other euro zone
countries would end up in even greater trouble.""
 Euro zone inflation last month exceeded the ECB's goal of
close to, but below 2 percent, for the first time in two years.
 
 NO EUPHORIA
 Germans' deep-seated fear of inflation -- a legacy of
Germany's hyperinflation in the 1920s, when a wheelbarrow full
of money was needed to buy a loaf of bread -- means they expect
the ECB to act to keep a lid on prices.
 A survey of German investors released on Wednesday showed
half expect higher interest rates by July, a few months earlier
than markets are currently pricing in. [ECB/INT]
 But raising rates now to cool price pressures in Germany is
the last thing peripheral euro zone economies need as they
battle with a sovereign debt crisis.
 On the topic of the euro zone crisis, Boerner said a
restructuring of Greek debt was inevitable.
 ""This is inevitable...and the sooner we face the facts the
better,"" he said. ""All options will have to be considered,
including a buyback of bonds.""
 Boerner also said that German exports, traditionally the
motor of Europe's largest economy, would rise 7 percent this
year and around 6 percent next year.
 Risks to foreign trade however were the development of the
economy in the United States and whether China could manage to
get a handle on inflation without braking growth.
 ""2012 will not be an euphoric year for the German economy,""
said Boerner.

 * Inflation concern biggest drive of reallocations
 * Less prominent markets could gain as main ones falter
 * Not seen as a rush to exit emerging markets

 By John Mair and Cheon Jong-woo	
 MANILA/SINGAPORE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A slide in Asian
equities since the start of 2011 that gained momentum this week
on fears over inflation is not a rush by investors to exit
emerging markets, but a paring of exposure to economies seen
with most to lose.	
 Sellers have targeted stocks in India, China and Indonesia,
worried authorities are being too slow to tighten policy in
these fast-emerging economies producing much of the world's
economic growth.	
 However, the funds are not necessarily leaving the region, a
relief to policymakers who worry that last's year record inflows
could become outflows that destabilise their economies.	
 Markets in Malaysia and South Korea, where the central banks
are seen to have a better handle on inflation following rates
rises, are strong. Indeed, just this week Korea's stock market
hit a record high.	
 ""The selloff seems to be concentrated in the countries where
foreign participation in the financial markets is high and where
central banks are deemed to be behind the curve,"" said Tim
Condon, head of research at ING Financial Markets in Singapore.	
 ""Treasuries were weak overnight and gold was down, which
leads me to think investors were not looking for safe havens but
merely wanted to reduce exposure to vulnerable emerging
markets.""	
 
 The MSCI stocks index of Asian stocks outside of Japan
posted this week its worst weekly performance in
nearly two months and is down just over 1 percent this month.	
 Indonesia and India, two investor favourites of recent
years, are leading the decline, down 8.7 percent and 7.3 percent
respectively since the start of the year.	
 China's stock market is down a more moderate 3.3
percent this year, but it slumped 14 percent in 2010 while other
emerging markets in the region roared ahead.	
 To be sure, Asia's markets are ripe for profit taking
anyhow. Between the end of 2008 and 2010, India's benchmark
stock index rose more than 110 percent and Indonesia's
nearly tripled; well ahead of gains of 39 percent in the
S&P 500 and 15.5 percent in Tokyo .	
 Latin American stocks are also seeing a selloff this year
after surging last year. They fell to a three-week low on
Thursday after Brazil raised interest rates and on concern China
may have to do the same following strong economic data.	
 Gerardo Sienra, who is in equity sales at Intercam in Mexico
City, said Latin American markets could be facing a steeper
selloff after closing 2010 strongly.	
 ""The general feeling of the market is that there could be
profit-taking and an adjustment, a pullback by markets after
the highs we saw in December and at the beginning of the year,""
he said. 
 For foreign investors, returns on their emerging markets
investments were amplified by the gains in emerging market
currencies, which had sparked fears of capital controls and
currency wars.	
 Now, with the dollar posting some gains and confidence
growing that the U.S. economy may have turned a corner,
investors may be taking the opportunity to take profits and
reinvest elsewhere.	
 ""There could be some reallocation of assets away from
emerging markets because there is some negative sentiment that
seems to be building up because of inflationary pressures,"" said
N. Bhanumurthy, economist with National Institute of Public
Finance and Policy, a Delhi-based think-tank.	
 ""That is the reason why you are seeing some capital flows,
what we term as hot money, going out of these economies.""	
 Bolstering the view that money may be leaving emerging
markets is the relative outperformance of U.S. and European
markets so far this year.	
 In contrast to the fall this year in the MSCI index of Asia
ex-Japan, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 2.1
percent, having rallied steadily since August, and the
FTSEurofirst 300 is up a similar amount.	
 
 ARE FEARS JUSTIFIED?	
 India finds itself considered as being behind the inflation
curve even though it has raised rates six times in 2010. It is
expected to rate rates again on Tuesday. 
 Food prices rose an annual 15.5 percent in the year to Jan
8, but the root causes -- bad weather damaging crops, poor
infrastructure and rising global prices -- can't be fixed by
interest rates.	
 In contrast, Indonesia and the Philippines are the only
Asian economies that have not raised rates since the global
financial crisis, raising investors concern they don't have a
handle on inflation as their economies recover.	
 But while annual inflation in Indonesia hit a 20-month high
of 6.96 percent in December, it was just 3 percent in the
Philippines.	
 Still, it is being targeted by investors worried about
inflation, possibly because food makes up a large portion of its
consumer price index.	
 ""I think the behind-the-curve perception is unwarranted,""
Condon said.	
 ""In Indonesia's and Philippines' case investors fear that
because their central banks have not hiked yet they may be
behind the curve. The fact that inflation in the Philippines was
steady at 3.0 percent in December has not spared it from the
sell-off.""	
 Philippine stocks have fallen 6 percent in January.	
 
 NOT UNIVERSAL	
 Gan Eng Peng, head of equities at HwangDBS Investment
Management Bhd in Kuala Lumpur, said investment funds that would
normally allocate a large portion of money to major markets such
as China and Indonesia were now looking elsewhere in the region.	
 ""We find that monies are increasingly confident about
investing into countries like Malaysia. If you take this in the
context where foreign ownership of stocks remains near historic
lows, there could be a lot more buying activity going forward,""
he said.	
 Indonesian and Philippine bonds took a hit on Friday, with
bond prices falling and credit default swap spreads, a measure
of risk, widening. But corporate bonds found buyers, showing
investors were not avoiding risk but were being selective.	
 ""Investors are already shifting money out of lower-yielding
safety investment grade assets into the high-yield sector which
is less sensitive to interest rate movements and inflation,""
said a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager.	
 ""People are getting more confident about the U.S. economic
recovery, which should benefit corporate balance sheets. So
people are willing to step down the credit curve as the economic
backdrop becomes more positive.""

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2011 08:08AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-French farmers turning to renewable energy," * Renewable energy offers more income, lower costs for farms
 * Biogas held up as virtuous rural cycle of energy, biomass
 * Prospects curbed by limited state support, competition
 
 By Gus Trompiz
 IGNEY, France, Jan 21 (Reuters) - An increasing number of
farmers will try to claim a share of France's renewable energy
sector to help cope with farm price volatility and counter
environmental criticism that has tarnished their rural image.
 Solar, wind and biomass energy are taking off in France in
the wake of national and European energy targets. Farmers see
them as a potential source of steady income amid erratic
commodity prices, a way of cutting costs and a riposte to an
image of farms as polluting.
 French farm income is estimated to have risen by two-thirds
in 2010 on the back of surging grain prices.
 Yet farmers say such gains are swallowed up by losses in bad
years -- the 2010 rise followed two years of sharp declines --
as well as rising costs linked to higher oil prices and stricter
environmental rules covering production.
 Although unlikely to transform most farmers' livelihoods,
renewable energy can ease these pressures.
 Farm groups are looking to biogas in particular as a model
for efficient, sustainable and locally controlled agriculture.
For now, solar and wind power are more common.
 In Igney and neighbouring villages in a northeastern farm
belt better known for Munster cheese, 99 locals provided 10
percent of a 35 million euro ($47.4 million) investment by local
start-up Erelia -- now part of GDF Suez -- to build 22 windmills
in the area.
 ""This project gave an impetus to renewable energies as a
whole in the district,"" said Stephane Malgras, a cattle farmer
who invested 10,000 euros in the project.
 Malgras says he receives a 7 percent annual dividend on top
of 6,000 euros each year for renting part of his fields for two
turbines.
 ""It's a bit of income, but it's not substantial compared to
the revenues of the farm,"" he cautions.
 On a bright, snowy winter's morning, the towering white
turbines have a harmonious appearance that lends weight to
Malgras' claim that ""no one has said it's ugly"".
 Solar energy has offered the prospect of a bigger return for
farmers. Several thousand of them have signed up to receive
attractive rates set by the government for selling electricity
to the grid from roof-integrated panels, which are well-suited
to farm hangars.
 The tariffs, safeguarded in 20-year contracts, have enabled
farmers to get bank loans sometimes worth millions to pay for
installation, providing the prospect of extra income for
retirement once loans are paid back after about 10 years.
 But the authorities are now trying to rein in a boom in
solar projects by decreeing a freeze on new approvals, provoking
the fury of farmers and the sector as a whole.
 
 THE VIRTUES OF BIOGAS
 French farmers are heavily involved in another expanding
form of renewable energy -- biofuels as rapeseed and sugar beet
growers sell a chunk of their crops to biofuel makers.
 Farmers have been caught up in controversy, however, as
biofuels have been branded unsustainable by green associations.
 Farm unions, moreover, see a drawback in biofuels, similar
to wind and solar power, in that the farmer has a relatively
passive role after the system is in place.
 They are now backing biogas as better integrated into
agriculture. On-farm biogas units use manure, fodder and other
organic matter to produce gas that yields electricity and heat,
plus a by-product, digestate, which is used to fertilise soil.
 ""It's sustainable development par excellence,"" Claude Roy,
member of a committee that advises the French farm ministry,
told a conference in Paris last month held by farm union FNSEA.
 ""The farmer controls the added value from A to Z.""
 In addition to selling electricity, farmers can use heat
generated to save on energy used to dry fodder or keep cattle
sheds warm, and reduce fertiliser costs thanks to digestate.
 Biogas thus offers a response to the cost of energy --
estimated at about 9 percent of farmers' input costs last year,
without including energy-rich fertilisers -- and also to
environmental goals, with agriculture under scrutiny as one of
the largest emitters of greenhouse gases among French sectors.
 Agricultural biogas is still tiny in France, with only 20 to
30 farm installations versus about 5,000 in Germany. A demanding
technical process, competition for organic waste from industrial
firms and Germany, and unattractive electricity tariffs are
among the constraints.
 ""It's much more complicated to do biogas than install solar
panels on a roof,"" Olivier Bertrand of French renewable energy
lobby SER notes.
 Farmers hope the authorities will favour rural biogas as
greener than industrial units and as meeting a European Union
ambition to make its farm policy more sustainable.
 France's farm minister has pledged support in an
energy-efficiency drive that he says will help struggling
breeders. ""It is vital that we catch up on this quickly,"" Bruno
Le Maire recently told reporters, saying Germany's larger biogas
sector yielded about 15,000 euros a year for the farms involved.

 (Adds quote, detail, updates prices)
By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a two-month high
against the dollar on Friday, helped by Asian sovereign demand
and improving confidence in the euro zone, but its rally
appeared on shaky ground as it neared key technical resistance.
 Expectations of a strengthened euro zone rescue fund and a
strong German Ifo report were lending support to the euro,
together with a more hawkish outlook from the European Central
Bank recently, but debt problems were still in the background.
 ""A strong IFO print in Germany buoyed optimism, although the
euro remains driven by speculation over talks of more concrete
measures slowly emerging from European policymakers,"" said Chris
Walker, currency strategist at UBS.
 The single currency hit a two-month high of $1.3569 on
trading platform EBS, boosted by a stronger-than-expected German
Ifo survey.. It broke past option barriers at $1.3550, though it
eased a bit and was last at $1.3525, up 0.3 percent on the day.
 Traders said major Asian sovereign accounts were also active
in driving the euro higher, while the focus was on a key
technical level at $1.3576, the 50 percent retracement of the
euro's fall from November to January.
 The single currency has gained more than 1 percent against
the greenback since the start of year, driven by growing
expectations that euro zone policymakers will arrive at a more
durable solution to the peripheral debt crisis and a hawkish ECB
which last week warned about price pressures.
 Still, doubts remained whether the euro could hold gains.
 ""This euro reaction seems overdone as it's highly unlikely
the ECB will raise rates soon and there's been nothing concrete
on the rescue fund,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.
 ""We think Portugal will have to be bailed out eventually.
After that the euro can rise further as Spain we believe is
solvent, but the euro rally is not sustainable here,"" he added.
 Spain is planning to force its regional savings banks to
become conventional banks and seek stock market listings, a
source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
 The debt-laden savings banks and a possibly expensive rescue
are seen as major risks for Spain's government as it
aggressively cuts its budget deficit.
 
 DOLLAR INDEX NEAR TWO-MTH LOW
 Spanish government bond yields fall, with the spread over
German Bunds narrowing to its tightest since mid-November, while
Portuguese bond spreads also came in.
 The euro rose to five-week highs around 112.24 yen, making a
technical break above a closely watched Japanese indicator, the
Ichimoku cloud, in the 112 yen area. A daily close above the
cloud would give the euro potential to rally further.
 The euro's rally helped to knock the dollar index down 0.4
percent to 78.50, not far from a two-month low of 78.303 hit on
Wednesday, while it lost 0.3 percent to 82.74 yen.
 A bounce in European shares also supported risk appetite.
Chinese shares closed up 1.4 percent, regaining some ground
after having slid nearly 3 percent the day before when Chinese
economic data pointed to further tightening.
 The Australian dollar was flat at $0.9886. The Aussie came
under pressure on Thursday when strong Chinese data renewed
worries the world's second-biggest economy could take a tougher
stance on fighting inflation this year, and ultimately slow its
demand for commodities.

 By Sakari Suoninen
 FRANKFURT, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Key euro-priced bank-to-bank
lending rates on Friday posted the strongest one-day rise since
October, as unease about Spain's banking sector filtered through
markets still digesting last week's inflation warning from the
ECB.
 The European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold at a
record low of 1 percent last week, but said the euro zone faces
short-term price pressures -- taken by some in financial markets
as a sign it could raise rates earlier than previously thought.
 Analysts said the recent rise in short-term market rates was
due to ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's hawkish tone on
inflation last week, though upward pressure was expected to ease
soon.
 ""We don't see scope for a big rise in Euribor rates, given
that the most probable driver is monetary policy,"" Unicredit
analyst Elia Lattuga said. 
 Unicredit expects the first ECB rate hike to come late this
year, and Lattuga said the three-month Euribor rate should
remain relatively close to 1.0 percent in the near future.
 The three-month rate  -- traditionally the main
gauge of unsecured interbank euro lending and a mix of interest
rate expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- rose to
1.025 percent from 1.016 percent for its strongest one-day rise
since Oct. 21.
 Other closely watched rates also rose. Six-month rates
 increased to 1.270 percent from 1.260 percent,
12-month rates  hit a 1-1/2 year high of 1.578
percent, while one-week rates  ticked up to 0.746
percent from 0.710 percent.
 Tight liquidity conditions at the start of the current
reserve maintenance period -- the timeframe over which banks are
required to deposit a set level of funds with the ECB -- meant
that overnight rates held at elevated levels -- Eonia rates
 rose to 0.713 percent on Thursday.
 ""Liquidity surplus has declined to 21 billion and it was 50
billion, so there is low liquidity in the system and this is
driving the increase in Eonia,"" said Giuseppe Maraffino, rate
strategist at Barclays Capital in London.
 ""I would expect Eonia to remain high in the current
maintenance period until the beginning of February and then
gradually decline... I would expect banks to use the next ECB
operation to take more liquidity.""
 Fears about the state of Spanish banks could also have
unsettled markets, but analysts saw the influence as limited --
at least for the time being.
 ""It doesn't seem to be a key driver, but of course this has
to be followed closely,"" Lattuga said.
 Spain plans a partial nationalisation of its weakest savings
banks as it seeks to reassure investors a rescue of the sector
will not weigh on its deficit, sources said. [ID:nLDE70K0A4]
 Estimates of the cost to recapitalise the savings banks
range from 17 billion to 120 billion euros, with consensus
falling in the 25 billion to 50 billion range.
 The three-month Euribor rate broke above the European
Central Bank's 1.0 percent benchmark rate for the first time in
well over a year in October in what was expected to be a
milestone in money markets' return to normality. [ID:nLDE68T13O]
[ID:nECB000002] 
 Rates began falling again in December, however, as the euro
zone debt crisis intensified and forced the ECB to extend its
limit-free lending support [ID:nLDE6B10EI] [ID:nLDE70C26B]. But
a stronger-than-expected warning from the ECB on inflation last
week has reversed the trend again.
 There is currently just over 21 billion euros of excess
liquidity in euro zone money markets, according to Reuters
calculations. The amount has dropped back since the start of the
year, when it topped 100 billion.
 While the ECB abandoned plans to scale back its crisis
support last month, it is now back to the range of funding
offerings it had before the onset of the financial crisis.
 Three-month loans are once again the longest maturity on
offer and banks have now paid back all the six-month and
12-month loans the ECB injected during the turmoil.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday,
boosted by reports that Spain plans to help recapitalise its
banking sector and strong results from U.S. bellwether General
Electric, while commodity prices also advanced.
 The euro hit a two-month high against the dollar on growing
expectations that euro zone policymakers will arrive at a more
durable solution to the debt crisis. Hawkish noises from the
European Central Bank were also cited as a reason for the latest
surge in the currency.
U.S. stock index futures rose 0.3 to 0.4 percent on the back
of the General Electric earnings. Bank of America's, however
reported a second straight quarterly loss, driven by a $2
billion writedown of its mortgage business.
 Spain's shares rose and borrowing costs eased after sources
and reports said Madrid plans a partial takeover of its weakest
savings banks as it seeks to reassure investors a costly bank
rescue will not weigh on its deficit.
 World stocks were also up but were set to post their biggest
weekly drop in eight weeks on concerns that rising inflation in
emerging economies, particularly in China and India, could lead
to aggressive policy action and hurt global growth.
 So far this year, Chinese and Indian equities have lost 3.3
and 7.3 percent, respectively. On the other hand, euro zone
peripheral equities, which were hit hard last year by the
sovereign debt crisis, have recovered in 2011.
 ""What underperformed last year is now being bought. Anything
that helps to stabilise the banking sector, especially in Spain,
has to be good news. In a dysfunctional banking sector -- this
is a good step but there's still a long way to travel,"" said
Andy Lynch, fund manager at Schroders in London.
 Spanish shares rose 2.1 percent and are up 10 percent in
January, while yields on the country's 10-year bond fell 10
basis points to 5.24 percent.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index gained 0.8 percent.
 A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Spain is
planning to force its debt-laden regional saving banks to become
conventional banks and seek stock market listings. 
 High levels of bad property loans at the savings banks are
seen as a major risk for Spain's government as it aggressively
cuts its budget deficit to stave off fears it will need an Irish
or Greek-style bailout from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund.
 Among Spanish bank shares, Banco Santander advanced 4
percent and BBVA put on 3.3 percent.
 
 EURO RISES, COMMODS REBOUND
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3522 after rallying to a
two-month high of $1.3556. It also hit a five-week high against
the yen, at around 112.20 yen.
 ""This reaction seems overdone as it's highly unlikely the
ECB will raise rates soon and there's been nothing concrete on
the rescue fund,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at
Barclays Capital.
 ""We think Portugal will have to be bailed out eventually.
After that the euro can rise further as Spain we believe is
solvent, but the euro rally is not sustainable here,"" he added.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 World equities as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index added 0.2 percent after falling for two days in a row. The
index has lost 0.9 percent this week, on track for its worst
weekly performance since late November.
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average dropped 1.6 percent and
posted its biggest weekly loss in three months.
 Copper recovered 0.9 percent after falling 3.6 percent in
the two previous sessions, and is down 2.2 percent for the week,
while oil snapped a three-session losing streak, up 1.2 percent.

 By Shrikesh Laxmidas and Andrei Khalip
 LISBON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Debt-laden Portugal is unlikely
to avoid a recession this year despite government forecasts for
some economic growth, but the contraction may be modest enough
to ensure a crucial budget deficit target is met.
 Slashing the deficit is vital to convincing investors
Portugal can solve its public finances and debt problems on its
own without seeking a bailout as Ireland and Greece did.
 However, over the longer term a return to decent rates of
growth will be central in determining whether its plan for
bringing down borrowing is credible, and analysts say it wil
take time for growth-boosting strategies to have an effect.
 Painful austerity measures like public sector wage cuts and
tax hikes adopted this year to meet the fiscal gap target of 4.6
percent of gross domestic product are set to decimate internal
consumption, while investment has been hammered by prohibitive
interest rates on credit, analysts say.
 The government says it beat its 7.3 percent budget deficit
target for 2010, but that was on the back of estimated economic
growth of at least 1.3 percent as well as a one-off pension fund
transfer to state coffers.
 The government is banking on continued export growth,
especially to new markets in fast-growing emerging economies, to
eke out an expansion of 0.2 percent this year.
 Analysts say exports surprised on the positive side last
year and should continue rising. However, they warn that export
diversification will take time to bear fruit, while Portugal's
main trading partner and neighbour Spain is itself implementing
tough austerity.
 ""So I guess the main question is what happens to domestic
demand - and with salary cuts and higher taxes it's pretty
obvious that there will be a contraction,"" said Silvio Peruzzo,
RBS economist in London.
 Private consumption accounts for two-thirds of GDP, while
exports account for less than a third.
 Meanwhile, unemployment is at a three-decade high of around
11 percent and contraction would only increase the number of
jobless, inflate the state's welfare benefits bill and reduce
tax revenues.
 The Bank of Portugal earlier this month painted a much
gloomier picture than the government's -- and most analysts' -
outlook, expecting a contraction of 1.3 percent this year before
a return to modest growth in 2012.
 Peruzzo said he expects a much smaller drop in economic
activity of 0.5 percent this year.
 ""I'd say it is possible to meet the budget deficit goal even
with this contraction,"" he said, adding though that additional
austerity measures could still be on the cards -- either as
means to avert a bailout or as part of a possible rescue deal.
 Diego Iscaro of IHS Global Insight consultants, whose
forecast for this year's contraction is 0.4 percent, added: ""The
deficit goal is ambitious and difficult, but not impossible"".
 He said, however, that more austerity would further depress
the economy.
 ""If Portugal receives a bailout it will not come for free --
the conditions are likely to be further fiscal measures and also
structural reforms. In the short term this may have negative
implications on the economy."" Iscaro said.
 The government has been adamant about not requiring foreign
aid and Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos has
criticised the practice of European bailouts saying they have so
far failed to solve any problems.
 Portugal holds a presidential ballot on Sunday and is
expected to give a second term to President Anibal Cavaco Silva,
bolstering the country's drive to avoid a bailout. Investor
concerns about Portugal's creditworthiness have made the
country's borrowing costs soar in the past year.
 ""Their debt burden is not really sustainable at current
rates of 7 percent, if you add inflation of about 2 percent. It
means there is some need for external support,"" Peruzzo said,
adding though that borrowing costs could fall if the European
Union agrees to bolster its safety net.
 European leaders have called on the euro zone weakling to
adopt strategies to boost competitiveness, including by making
the labour market more flexible so that companies can fire and
hire more easily depending on the economic situation.
 ""I don't think the difference between modest growth and a
small contraction this year is that important,"" said Filipe
Garcia, head of Informacao de Mercados Financeiros consultants.
 ""What is important is to change the structure of the
economy, to make it more sustainable with less state weight and
more exports,"" the Porto-based economist said.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2011 06:48AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-New Hungary cbank council dovish, but won't cut rates"," * Cbank seen cautious with easing, eyeing forint -analysts
 * 9 of 15 analysts see new council open to monetary stimulus
 * Most analysts do not expect rise in inflation target
 
 By Krisztina Than and Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A revamped Hungarian monetary
council with members chosen by a government-controlled committee
will be open to using stimulus measures to support an unorthodox
pro-growth agenda but is not expected to start cutting interest
rates.
 Council members backed by the government will be in a
majority after the parliament committee appoints four new
rate-setters in March under a rule change planned by the
Fidesz-led government, which has criticised central bank policy
as too restrictive since sweeping to power last spring.
 Mindful of the dangers of a much weaker forint, as well as
domestic inflation risks and the global market environment, the
new-look rate-setting body will not start cutting borrowing
costs, a Jan 19-20 Reuters poll of analysts showed on Friday.
 But it may risk the market's displeasure by opting for
unconventional stimulus moves such as buying corporate bonds in
the secondary market or trying to rechannel trillions of forints
held in the bank's 2-week bills into the economy.
 Nine of 15 analysts surveyed said it was possible the
central bank (NBH) would start buying bonds including those of
state-owned MFB Bank to boost the economy, a government idea
which has to date been rejected by the bank.
 While nine of 18 analysts said the NBH would turn generally
more dovish in its policy, the poll showed analysts do not
expect the new Council to act irresponsibly and risk forint
falls, as that would hit the country's many Swiss franc
 loan holders.
 ""I expect a more dovish policy, but not at the expense of a
much weaker exchange rate,"" said David Nemeth at ING.
 
 RATE HIKE NEXT WEEK?
 The NBH raised interest rates by 50 basis points in two
steps late last year to 5.75 percent  and a majority of
analysts expect another hike to 6.0 percent next Monday.
[ID:nLDE70J004]
 The centre-right government, which has rejected the path of
austerity and instead used a series of unorthodox measures to
boost economic growth, has said the rate increases were
unjustified.
 But a full policy U-turn under the new monetary council is
unlikely.
 ""Raising interest rates will be taken off the agenda, but
they will pay attention to the exchange rate,"" said Gergely
Szabo Forian at Pioneer Fund Management.
 The median forecast of analysts showed the base rate at 6
percent at the end of June and the same level at the end of both
2011 and 2012, though some said a cut was possible in the second
quarter of this year.
 ""We forecast flat (rates) from February but risks are
strongly to the downside,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.
 If wide-ranging fiscal reforms promised by the government by
next month satisfy investors, reducing risk premiums on
Hungarian assets, there could be bigger room for easing, some
analysts said.
 But if the plans disappoint, markets could punish Hungary,
with its debt rating possibly downgraded to ""junk"" status.
 
 INFLUENCE OVER POLICY?
 The legislative change, which the European Central Bank has
criticised, will allow a Fidesz-majority parliamentary committee
to nominate four rate-setters to replace members whose mandates
expire on March 1, potentially increasing government influence
over monetary policy.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy has not only criticised the
bank's rate policy but also called on the bank to be more
supportive to the government's pro-growth policies.
 He told Kossuth Radio in Sept. 2010 that growth could pick
up in 2011 if the central bank ""switches on monetary stimulus""
and that he expected the bank's policy to change after the
composition of the Council changes. [ID:nLDE68G0JE]
 A media report in November said the government may also want
the bank to raise its 3 percent inflation target.[ID:nLDE6AS18T]
 While 13 of 17 analysts said they did not expect the new
Council to raise the inflation target, most forecast the bank
could launch some kind of monetary stimulus.
 ""If the government wants a new financing model affecting
corporate bonds, that (support from the new Council) may be
possible,"" said Pioneer's Forian, adding that it could be a
risky move.
 ""There are plenty of kinds of monetary stimulus and all of
them can have a common impact on investors: they may scare them,
causing a forint weakening and a rise in yields.""
 Some analysts also highlighted the risk that if NBH Governor
Andras Simor -- viewed by markets as a safe pair of hands -- and
his two vice governors are constantly outvoted, they may resign
from the council.
 Simor has said repeatedly that he wanted to fulfil his
mandate which runs until 2013.
 ""It's possible (that someone resigns), but I don't think
that this is likely. Instead they would express their dissenting
opinion and try to persuade the external members to pursue a
different policy,"" said Janos Samu, analyst at Concorde.
 ""In the case of Simor we have seen a very strong commitment
that he will stay.""

 * Output seen up 1 percent in 2011 vs -9.4 percent last yr
 * Dutch builders undervalued vs European peers

 By Greg Roumeliotis
 AMSTERDAM, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The hard-hit Dutch
construction industry is set for a dramatic turnaround this
year, in contrast to several other European countries, that
could buoy its underperforming builders.
 Shares in Dutch construction groups such as Royal BAM and
Heijmans are trading at a discount to European peers after an
industry downturn that was one of the sharpest in Western
Europe.
 But construction output in the Netherlands is expected to
bounce back this year, helped by a revival in house building. By
contrast, in Europe as a whole output is set to contract for the
fourth year running, according to forecasts by market research
organisation Euroconstruct.
 This combination of low company valuations and the prospect
of a sharp rebound in output has already piqued investors'
interest. Heijmans shares hit a 16-month high this week and are
up 40 percent since the start of September, outperforming a 22
percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Construction & Materials
index.
 Unlike countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, where
construction output is expected to shrink as governments slash
spending to deal with a debt crisis, Dutch construction is set
for a recovery as the economy shows mild export-driven growth.
 Euroconstruct forecasts construction output in the
Netherlands will rise by 1 percent in 2011 after falling 9.4
percent in 2010.
 ""We are looking at the trough of the cycle, Dutch
construction companies are leaner and meaner and valuations are
low,"" SNS Securities analyst Edwin de Jong said.
""If you look at historical price to earnings, Dutch builders
have traded between 6 and 10, this is a good time to buy.""
 Heijmans trades at 6.9 times forward 12-month earnings, BAM
at 8.4 times, while their euro zone peers trade at an average of
12.2 times, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine.
 Analysts expect the Dutch housing market, which suffered a
sharp slump during the global credit crisis, to start recovering
this year after average prices barely rose on a quarterly basis
in 2010.
 ""More people should start looking at buying homes come
March-April, helping clear the backlog of homes and leading to
residential construction increasing in the second half of 2011,""
Theodoor Gilissen analyst Tom Muller said.
 The recovery is then expected to pick up, according to
Euroconstruct, with construction output growing by 2.4 percent
in 2012 and 2.9 percent in 2013.
 ""For the moment we have not had a lot of good news in Dutch
construction, but a recovery is anticipated, and you need just a
little bit of good news to get the stocks of these builders
going,"" said Jack Jonk, head of equities at Delta Lloyd Asset
Management, one of the biggest investors in Dutch builders.
 Delta Lloyd holds for itself and its funds a total 6 percent
stake in BAM, 13 percent stake in Heijmans and 15 percent stake
in Ballast Nedam, Jonk said.
 BAM is expected to have one of the highest sector yields as
a percent of its estimated earnings this year -- 10.6 percent as
opposed to a 7.3 percent average of 63 euro zone construction
and engineering stocks, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.
 Heijmans is seen as better positioned to gain in a recovery.
It has taken a lot of the restructuring pain ahead of BAM and
now has the most exposure in the residential market out of the
major Dutch builders and less risk in its land holdings.
 ""Heijmans has made good progress on cost control and should
be able to sustain its margins in a stabilising or slightly
improving market,"" ABN AMRO analyst Dusan van Leeuwen wrote in a
note this week.

 By Ben Blanchard 
 BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Chinese media praised President
Hu Jintao's visit to the United States on Friday as a diplomatic
""masterstroke"" in easing tensions, but reports largely ignored
thornier questions of currency and human rights.	
 State television news channels gave blanket coverage of the
ceremony of Hu's state dinner and welcome at the White House, in
a reflection of China's desire for its leader to be portrayed as
a valued and honoured player on the world stage.	
 The usually nationalistic tabloid the Global Times, not
known for kind words towards the United States, praised the trip
as an ""important contribution towards world peace"", but some
bloggers questioned Sino-U.S. relations, which have been also
strained over issues ranging from U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to
China's control of the Internet.	
 ""The world should applaud Hu Jintao's trip to the United
States and the outstanding foresight of Chinese and American
leaders,"" the Global Times wrote in an editorial. ""China's and
the U.S. attitude has set aside numerous fears in the
Asia-Pacific region.""	
 The official Xinhua news agency said the visit was ""a
historic masterstroke of China-U.S. diplomacy with global
significance"".	
 While Hu's awkward answer to reporters' questions about
human rights was essentially ignored by Chinese media -- hardly
a surprise in a country that carefully stage-manages its
leaders' public image -- there was some oblique reference to
currency issues.	
 Hu did not publicly address this issue, which has angered
many U.S. lawmakers, who argue that China keeps its yuan weak to
boost exports, costing millions of U.S. jobs and increasing a
trade gap that Washington puts at $270 billion.	
 Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily said in a
front page commentary on its overseas edition that the United
States also had an obligation towards its own currency,
especially as China is the world's largest holder of U.S.
government debt.	
 ""As the issuer of the world's main reserve currency, the
United States should adopt a responsible attitude and maintain
reasonable stability in the supply of the U.S. dollar, avoid the
misuse of the dollar causing global inflation, economic
imbalances and upheavals in financial markets,"" it wrote.	
 Chinese bloggers for their part questioned who would pay for
the $45 billion in deals signed and criticised President Barack
Obama for treating Hu as a ""god of wealth"", even as China
struggles with inflation and widespread poverty.	
 ""I was so angry when I listened to the news of Boss Hu's
visit this morning. Obama treated Hu as the god of wealth, but
Hu cannot think like that,"" wrote one user on Sina.com's popular
microblogging site. ""Is there any god of wealth whose family is
so poor or CPI (consumer price index) so high?""	
 ""The Yankees are happy to have won this $45 billion order,
but I'm wondering if this is money I have paid as tax,"" wrote
another.	
 The Global Times, which is run by the People's Daily, also
cautioned against excessive optimism following the visit.	
 ""President Obama said that the 'U.S. welcomes China's rise'.
This message has not been widely accepted in the United States.
The acceptance and judgment of China's rise in the United States
will largely decide the direction of Sino-U.S. relations.""	
 Relations between China and the United States last year were
strained over territorial issues such as the U.S. arms sales to
self-ruled Taiwan, an island China considers its own, a meeting
between Obama and the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing reviles as a
separatist, and differing claims to parts of the South China
Sea.	
 The two countries clashed over human rights, the value of
China's currency, trade, investment rules and the Chinese
regulatory environment, especially control of the Internet.	
 The United States has also pushed China to be tougher in
helping to rein in Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programmes.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - World stocks edged up on Friday
but were set to post their biggest weekly drop in eight weeks on
concerns that rising inflation in emerging economies could lead
to aggressive policy action and hurt global growth.
Spain's stocks rose. Madrid plans a partial state takeover
of its weakest savings banks as it seeks to reassure investors a
costly bank rescue will not weigh on its deficit, sources and
reports said.
 The euro hit a two-month high against the dollar on growing
expectations that euro zone policymakers will arrive at a more
durable solution to the debt crisis. Hawkish noises from the
European Central Bank were also cited as a reason for the latest
surge in the currency.
 Worries over inflation in China and India have put their
stock markets under pressure, with Chinese stocks down 3.3
percent so far this year and Indian equities down 7 percent.
Other euro zone peripheral equities, which were hit hard
last year by the sovereign debt crisis, have also recovered in
2011 on the back of rising inflation in emerging markets.
 Commodity prices have also suffered as China is a top
consumer, though copper and oil prices recovered on Friday.
 ""Background is still somewhat nervous given concerns over
further tightening measures in China,"" said Keith Bowman, equity
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown in London.
 World equities as measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index added 0.1 percent after losing for two days in a row. The
index has fallen 1 percent this week, on track for its worst
weekly performance since late November.
 Spain's stocks rose 0.9 percent and are up nearly 9 percent
in January, while yields on 10-year Spanish government bond
over benchmark German Bunds were steady at 219 basis points.
 A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Spain is
planning to force its debt-laden regional saving banks to become
conventional banks and seek stock market listings. 
 High levels of bad property loans at the savings banks are
seen as a major risk for Spain's government as it aggressively
cuts its budget deficit to stave off fears it will need an Irish
or Greek-style bailout from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund.
 Among Spanish banks, Banco Santander advanced 2.2 percent
and BBVA put on 2 percent.
 
 EURO RISES, COMMODS REBOUND
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.3533 after rallying to a
two-month high of $1.3556. It also hit a five-week high against
the yen, at around 112.20 yen.
 ""This reaction seems overdone as it's highly unlikely the
ECB will raise rates soon and there's been nothing concrete on
the rescue fund,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at
Barclays Capital.
 ""We think Portugal will have to be bailed out eventually.
After that the euro can rise further as Spain we believe is
solvent, but the euro rally is not sustainable here,"" he added.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index gained 0.2 percent,
while U.S. stock index futures eased around 0.1 percent,
indicating a weak open on Wall Street
ahead of results from General Electric and Bank of America.
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average dropped 1.6 percent and
posted its biggest weekly loss in three months.
 Copper recovered 0.5 percent after falling 3.6 percent in
the two previous sessions, and is down 2.5 percent for the week,
while oil snapped a three-session losing streak, up 0.4 percent.

By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a two-month high
versus the dollar on Friday, helped by Asian demand and
improving confidence in the euro zone, but its rally was on
shaky ground as it approached key technical resistance.
 Successful bond sales from highly indebted countries,
including Portugal and Spain, and expectations of a strengthened
euro zone rescue fund were lending the euro support, together
with a more hawkish outlook from the European Central Bank but
debt problems were still in the background.
 ""This reaction seems overdone as it's highly unlikely the
ECB will raise rates soon and there's been nothing concrete on
the rescue fund,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at

 ""We think Portugal will have to be bailed out eventually.

 Spain is planning to force its regional savings banks to
become conventional banks and seek stock market listings, a
source familiar with the matter told Reuters,
 The debt-laden savings banks and a possibly expensive rescue
are seen as major risks for Spain's government as it
aggressively cuts its budget deficit.
 The single currency rose to a two-month high of $1.3566,
given a further boost by the release of a stronger-than-expected
German Ifo survey. It was last at $1.3540, up 0.5 percent on the
day.
 Traders said major Asian sovereign accounts were again
active in driving the euro higher, while focus was on a key
technical level at $1.3576, the 50 percent retracement of the
euro's fall from November to January.
 ""To diminish the risk of an upside break-out towards $1.3700
we would need to see a move below this week's lows around
$1.3240 as well as the 55-week moving average (at $1.3271),""
said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets.
 The euro rose to five-week highs versus around 112.20 yen,
making a technical break above a closely watched Japanese
indicator, the Ichimoku cloud, in the 112 yen area. A daily
close above the cloud would give the euro potential to rally
further.
 
 DOLLAR INDEX NEAR TWO-MONTH LOW
 The euro's rally helped to knock the dollar index down 0.4
percent to 78.493, not far from a two-month low of 78.303 hit on
Wednesday, while it slipped 0.3 percent to 82.75 yen.
 A bounce in Chinese equities also helped to support risk
appetite. Shanghai shares rose 1.4 percent, regaining some
ground after having slid nearly 3 percent the day before as
latest Chinese economic data pointed to further policy
tightening.
 The Australian dollar was 0.1 percent lower on the day at
$0.9865 after coming under pressure on Thursday when strong
Chinese data renewed worries the world's second biggest economy
could take a tougher stance on fighting inflation this year, and
ultimately slow its demand for commodities.

 SYDNEY, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Australia's devastating floods,
which shut mines and damaged rail lines, could cut coal exports
by around 15 million tonnes, or 20 percent this quarter, even as
collieries show signs of recovery, the government's commodities
forecasting agency said on Friday.	
 Coal ports in hardest-hit Queensland state escaped severe
damage, but are still operating well under capacity as a result
of lower coal receivals, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) said. 
 ABARES estimates flooding due to monsoon rains that started
in November could lower coal export earnings by A$2.0 - $2.5
billion ($1.97-billion-2.47 billion) during the quarter to March
31.	
 ""Coal production at affected mines has been reduced because
of a number of factors, including flooded pits and difficulties
in removing the water, and a lack of access to mine sites
because of flooded roads,"" it said.	
 
Australia was forecast to export 160 million tonnes of
metallurgical coal and 158 million tonnes of thermal coal in
fiscal 2011, according to ABARES.	
 Cockatoo Coal and Aquila Resources on
Friday partially resumed operations in hardest Queensland state
as floodwaters continued to recede. 
 But in the aftermath of one of Australia's worst natural
disasters on record, mining companies say operations are still
far from normal: Vital rail corridors linking mines with export
terminals are only slowing being reactivated and force majeure
-- a legal let-out enabling miners to break sales contracts
without penalty -- remain in place across Queensland.	
 
 COAL OPERATIONS 
 Aquila, which mines 2.8 million tonnes a year of
metallurgical and thermal coals from its Issac Plains mine in
50-50 partnership with Brazil's Vale warned it would
still take some time to resume full operations. Cockatoo Coal
said mining at its Baralaba operations would not start
before February. 
 The Baralaba mine suffered some of the worst damage during
the flooding after a levy protecting the lode collapsed sending
a torrent of water into the pit.	
 Flooding at other mines -- most concentrated in the inland
Bowen Basin -- was restricted to rainwater.	
 ""Whilst all equipment is in working order, resumption of
full production rates will take some time while dewatering of
the site is completed, Cockatoo said. 
 It only expects to restart mining in February once pit
dewatering provides improved access. 
 ""A phased program of dewatering/mining is then expected to
continue for several weeks as the mine returns to planned
production capacity (about 150,000 tonnes per quarter),""
Cockatoo said. 
 Suppliers of pumping equipment needed to empty water from
the mines have said they will be hard-pressed to meet demand and
environmentalists are concerned the water may pose health
risks. 
 The flooding has been blamed on rains triggered by a La
Nina Pacific weather pattern that has devastated huge areas of
the eastern seaboard.	
 Rio Tinto RIO.L> this week said its Queensland coal
mines were operational but still constrained and left its force
majeure declaration in place. . 
 BHP Billiton , the world's largest supplier
of sea-borne hard coking coal via a joint venture with Japan's
Mitsubishi Corp , is bracing for lower production over
the next six months in the aftermath of the flooding, which
trimmed December quarter output by a third. 
 The flooding has driven contract prices for coking coal as
high as $225 per tonne for the first quarter of 2011, compared
to $209 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Spot prices have shot up to more than $350 per tonne and
consultants Wood Mackenzie said prices could reach $500.

 This will mean higher second-quarter contract prices, based
on average daily spot prices over the previous three months. 
 But a quicker-than-expected return to production would
likely end the upward trajectory in coal prices, according to
Patersons Securities analyst Andrew Harrington.	
 ""This happened after flooding in 2007/08 caused the price to
go up and then fall back,"" Harrington said.	
 
 WHEAT QUALITY DOWN, COTTON HIT	
 ABARES also estimated flooding cut agricultural production
by at least A$500 million to A$600 million in 2010/11.	
 It said the winter harvest, including wheat, barley and
canola, in most of the flood-affected regions was either
complete or near completion before the recent flooding.	
 But a wet harvest means Australia, usually the world's
fourth biggest wheat exporter, could see more than 10 million
tonnes of wheat downgraded in quality to low quality milling
wheat or feed wheat. A wet growing season means a near record 26
million tonnes of the grain could be harvested nationally.	
 ABARES also estimated that around seven percent of
Australian cotton plantings, valued at A$150 million in 2010-11
was destroyed and a further 2 percent were at risk if the crops
did not have the opportunity to dry out.	
The 2010/11 Australian cotton harvest could be 3.95 million
bales, 8 percent below an earlier estimate but the July to June
year harvest would still be a record, exceeding the 3.52 million
bales harvested in 2001/02, Rabobank said in a report last week.
(4.4 bales equals 1 tone) 
 The wet weather in Queensland has had a limited impact on
other mineral and energy commodity production concentred further
north of the coalfields 
 The one notable exception was Rio Tinto declaring force
majeure at its Boyne Island aluminium smelter.	
 Force majeure was lifted on Friday after road and rail
access to the port of Brisbane was restored .

 By Andrew Stern and Nick Carey
 CHICAGO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao
took his roadshow to the U.S. Midwest, where executives from
the two countries were set to sign up to 60 new deals on Friday
to underscore the message that China is open for business.
 Leaving behind the rancor of Washington where he was
pressed on human rights and currency policy, Hu was feted by
the Chicago elite at a gala dinner in U.S. President Barack
Obama's hometown.
 The Chinese leader was scheduled to wrap up his four-day
state visit with stops at a school and a business exhibition.
 Hundreds of Chicago-area and Chinese executives were due to
meet and sign deals at the first U.S.-China Trade and Economic
Cooperation Forum, organizers said.
 ""Across the entire United States, Chicago stands at the
forefront in developing relations with China,"" Hu told the
city's mayor, Richard Daley, on Thursday night, the China News
Service reported.
 ""As China-U.S. ties develop, there are even broader
prospects for local-level contacts and cooperation between our
two countries.""
 BIG NAMES TO SIGN DEALS
 Among the companies expected to announce agreements on
Friday were China-based computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd, China
Telecom and yarn and fabric maker Weiqiao Textile Co Ltd.
 U.S. companies with deals included Intel Corp, Microsoft
Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc, network equipment maker Cisco
Systems Inc and Cargill's cotton operation.
 Analysts said Hu's trip had gone smoothly enough to help
set a better tone to the relationship after a flare-up in
tensions last year over issues including trade, North Korea and
Internet censorship.
 U.S. officials touted an acknowledgment from Hu at a joint
news conference that more needs to be done on human rights in
China and welcomed $45 billion in export deals with China.
 Chinese media lauded the visit as a ""historic masterstroke""
in easing tensions.
 State television news channels gave blanket coverage to the
ceremony of Hu's state dinner and welcome at the White House,
in a reflection of China's desire for its leader to be
portrayed as a valued and honored player on the world stage.
 But the reports largely ignored thornier questions of
China's currency policies and human rights record.
 The trip has been billed by some experts as the most
important U.S.-China meeting in more than 30 years. Obama has
said the relationship between the two countries will help shape
the 21st century.

 * Faster to get funds raised via synthetic debt into China 
 * Investors clamour for yuan assets but there are risks	
 
 By Nethelie Wong and Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters)- The nascent offshore yuan
market's growth in Hong Kong has been rapid, but its
shortcomings are giving rise to a synthetic sister that may grow
even more quickly.	
 Companies and institutions have been steadily queuing to
issue yuan-denominated debt in Hong Kong, nicknamed ""dim sum
bonds"", at very low cost, thanks to investors of all stripes
willing to accept low yields in return for direct exposure to a
currency expected to strengthen this year.	
 For the borrowers, though, getting the yuan back into China
can be a lengthy, complicated process, especially with Beijing
getting more hawkish against hot money. Plus, the limited pool
of yuan in Hong Kong, while growing, has prevented borrowers
from pushing big deals through the market. 
 Synthetic yuan bonds may be the answer to non-investment
grade companies looking to raise funds to bring into China, such
as Chinese property developers. 
 At the same time, the bonds meet the heavy demand for yuan
assets among international investors. The hybrid structure of
these securities means investors are paid renminbi for lending
borrowers U.S. dollars. So the potential pool of investors
expands to include anyone with dollars to invest. 
 ""Synthetic bonds are riding on the wave of investors
migrating their assets from U.S. dollars to renminbi,"" said a
banker who worked on Evergrande Real Estate Group's
jumbo 9.25 billion yuan ($1.41 billion) synthetic deal that
priced last week.	
 Evergrande's two-tranche issuance was the biggest high-yield
bond deal ever in Asia. 
 ""The beauty of the deal is that the investors do not need to
have any renminbi funding.""

 Last year only saw one synthetic deal come to market worth 3
billion yuan, while the burgeoning dim sum bond market produced
33 deals worth about 42.6 billion yuan. 
 Twenty days into 2011 and there were already 15.8 billion
yuan of synthetic bonds issued and 4.5 billion yuan of dim sum
debt.	
 Most of the yuan outside of China is collecting in Hong
Kong, which has become the laboratory for Beijing's attempts to
spread the use of its currency abroad. At its current rate of
growth the yuan deposit base in Hong Kong could hit 2 trillion
yuan this year from 280 billion yuan as of November 2010. 
 
 WHEN A YUAN IS NOT A YUAN	
 Last year high-profile multinational companies like
McDonald's Corp and Caterpillar Inc tapped Hong Kong's yuan
market, also called the CNH market, for symbolic amounts of
funding, but the bureaucratic process of moving the money into
China is daunting for many borrowers.	
 Ironically, yuan raised in Hong Kong is treated like a
foreign currency by China's foreign exchange regulator. The
speed that it takes to get the ""foreign yuan"" into China depends
on the location of the borrowing company's mainland operations,
because provincial governments ultimately handle the process. 
 By contrast, the average time that it will probably take to
get dollars raised via a synthetic bond into the mainland is
around four weeks, including the time taken for preparing
documentation, debt bankers said.	
 For a repeat issuer, like Shui On Land , which has
issued two synthetic yuan bonds in a month, it could take around
two to three weeks, they said.	
 ""CNH remittance is approved on a case-by-case basis. There
are no clear existing guidelines on this. But the procedures are
well in place for USD inflows into China. There is a clear
channel where you go through the necessary steps,"" Vivian
Wai-man Lam, partner with law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker in Hong Kong, said. 
 Lam advised China SCE Property Holdings on its
5-year, 2 billion yuan synthetic deal that priced on Jan. 7.	
 Unless Beijing makes its capital account more porous in the
near term, she expects high-yield borrowers in the offshore yuan
market to choose synthetic rather than dim sum bonds, especially
since the funds are cheaper than the dollar bond market.	
 Nomura said in a research note Evergrande's synthetic 5-year
paper that priced at 9.25 percent would have had an equivalent
yield of about 11.8 percent if the company did a straight U.S.
dollar bond without the renminbi exposure. 
 
 SECONDARY THOUGHTS 
 For investors, the synthetic bonds are not without their
risks.	
 Evergrande's 3-year and 5-year bonds dropped to 99.25 almost
immediately in the secondary market after pricing at par,
despite meeting overwhelming demand in the primary market.	
 Some bankers said that this was because investors ended up
with more bonds than they wanted because the competitive order
book made them over bid.	
 Another risk is sector concentration. All four issuers of
synthetic yuan bonds in the past month have been Chinese
property developers. Investors may at some point think twice
about the risks surrounding an industry so vulnerable to further
policy tightening in China and demand higher yields.	
 For now expectations of yuan appreciation is clearly
outweighing any of the risks associated with yuan assets.	
 The yuan has risen more than 3 percent against the dollar
since June when China announced it was loosening its grip on the
currency. Though it is still tightly controlled, a Reuters poll
earlier this month showed economists see the currency rising a
further 5.4 percent over the next 12 months as Beijing tries to
quell inflation.	
 ""If investors maintain the view of an appreciating Chinese
currency, they will continue to accept a lower yield in return
for exposure to an expected rise in value for the RMB, thus
making synthetic RMB bonds relatively attractive vis-à-vis U.S.
dollar ones for Chinese issuers,"" analysts from Moody's
Investors Service said in a report on Wednesday. 
 Indeed, at a time when mainland money markets are
increasingly volatile and Chinese bond yields are surging on
expectations of tightening policy, offshore yuan capital markets
are booming. 
 ""Borrowers are filling their boots while they can,"" said the
head of debt capital markets at a bank in Hong Kong.

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Mari Terawaki
 TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investors turned
optimistic towards domestic stocks in January, with a key index
matching a nine-month peak as stronger share prices in Tokyo
boosted confidence, a Reuters survey showed.
 A bright outlook for Japanese corporate earnings also helped
bolster sentiment.
 ""Japanese corporate earnings are expected to improve further
in the second half of the year, so the outlook for Japanese share
prices will be even stronger,"" said an investor in his 50s.
 The Reuters sentiment index, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of investors who say they are bearish from those that
are bullish, posted its first positive reading since April.
 The index rose 10 points to plus 8 in January, matching a
three-year high reached in April, following the biggest-ever
improvement, of 58 points to minus 2, the previous month.
 Investor sentiment has been improving in tandem with Japan's
benchmark Nikkei average, which has climbed 3 percent this year
and 15 percent since the start of November.
 The Reuters survey of 407 Japanese individual investors was
conducted Jan. 12-15, during which the Nikkei hit an eight-month
intraday high of 10,620.57 on Jan. 13 after foreign investors
continued to pile in to Japanese equities.
 Retail investors remain concerned the yen could strengthen
again, but major falls in the Japanese currency would prompt more
inflows into domestic shares, investors said.
 The yen stood at around 82-83 against the dollar during the
survey, near its level during the previous poll, held slightly
over a month ago.
 ""A strong recovery in the U.S. economy could weaken the yen
to around 90 (to the dollar). That would be positive for the
Japanese economy and share prices,"" an investor in his 60s said.
 The poll showed that about 60 percent of investors believed
market trends in China and other Asian countries would be the key
theme for Japanese equity markets this year.
 Investors also said the trend for easing monetary policy in
the United States and the outcome of the debt crisis in the euro
zone would be important factors for the market in 2011.
 The poll showed that 55 percent of respondents thought the
extension of tax breaks for investment in securities or a
corporate tax cut would be positive for stocks, while 43 percent
said such steps would have no impact.

capture the views of readers of an online magazine targeted at

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were set to post
their worst weekly performance in nearly two months as rising
inflation within the region increased the risks of aggressive
policy action and hurt growth in the world's engines such as
China and India. 
 Investors have been reluctant to add positions in emerging
market stocks and bonds so far this year after record inflows in
2010 due to concerns that policy inertia may put growth-focused
authorities behind the curve in fighting price pressures.	
 Foreigners have rotated funds out of high inflation risk
economies such as Indonesia and into developed markets such as
Japan this year and inflows into emerging market local currency
bond funds, a favorite last year, have slowed considerably.	
 The MSCI index of Asia and Pacific shares excluding Japan
extended its drop to 0.8 percent, after falling
more than 1.8 percent on Wednesday, weighed down by selling in
sectors such as materials and energy which in
turn have buckled due to a selloff in commodities this week.	
 For the week, it is down by 1.43 percent, its biggest drop
since the end of November in 2010.	
 ""The market's pretty skittish when it comes to the risk of
policy tightening,"" said Pengana Capital portfolio manager Tim
Schroeders.	
 ""I think there's some sector rotation out of those better
performing materials and energy stocks back into financials,""
Schroeders said.	
 Chinese consumer prices in December rose 4.6 percent from a
year earlier, staying above forecasts of 4.4 percent and raising
prospects of a rate hike as soon as around the Lunar New Year
holidays in early February. .	
 In India, headline inflation accelerated to 8.43
pecent in December from a year earlier. Analysts expect a
quarter point rate increase at a review next week.
.	
 Within the region, Indonesia and Thailand
were the worst performers, falling by more than 3 and nearly 2
percent respectively.	
 Indian shares fell by nearly 0.5 percent with
market bellwether Wipro Ltd falling by more than 4
percent.	
 
 COMMODITIES PAUSE	
 Commodities steadied after a sharp selloff this week, though
sentiment remained fragile on concerns that tighter policy may
cool growth and sap demand from resource-hungry Asia.	
 Oil was on track for a weekly drop of more than 2
oercent on Friday to below the $90/dollar mark, after rising to
nearly $100 just a week ago.	
 London copper prices rose slightly, after shedding
2.3 percent in the previous session.	
 Analysts said China data showing a sharp jump in the annual
growth rate and a smaller-than-expected slowdown in December
inflation fed expectations of further policy tightening that
could hurt demand for base metals. But tightening had so far
been orderly.	
 ""Our reading of the numbers was that they were best you
could hope for. GDP is growing, inflation appears contained and
interest rates are 150 basis points below pre-crisis levels,""
said Ben Westmore, commodities economist at National Australia
Bank.	
 But the broad wave of risk aversion towards emerging markets
and upbeat U.S. data gave a lift to the dollar which hit
one-week highs versus the yen amd the Swiss franc .	
 The euro , too, held its ground due to combination of
factors, including successful bond sales from highly indebted
countries, including Portugal and Spain, and hopes that
officials will agree to beef up a euro zone rescue fund.	
 Bids from Asian central banks have also helped the single
currency all this week, traders said.	
 Gold steadied after a near two percent drop in the
previous session. It paused at $1,346.91 an ounce after sliding
to a two-month low of $1,342.65 in the previous session.

 * Implementation of promise is key, business leaders say
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - China's plan to change
itself from a major manufacturer to a leading global source of
innovation poses an enormous challenge for U.S. companies whose
competitive edge depends on coming up with the next big idea.
 Those firms may be able to breathe a little easier after
China pledged during President Hu Jintao's visit to Washington
this week to ""delink"" its indigenous innovation policies from
its $88 billion-plus government procurement market.
 ""This issue has been one of our top advocacy priorities for
the past year,"" said John Frisbie, president of the U.S. China
Business Council, which represents more than 200 American
companies that do business with China.
 China's commitment is ""potentially very significant""
depending on how it is implemented, Frisbie said.
 China's indigenous innovation drive refers to policies
intended to spur its domestic firms to develop technologies and
products as good as or better than those offered by the United
States, Europe and Japan.
 U.S. industry has feared being locked out of the vast
Chinese central, provincial and local government procurement
markets unless companies agree to develop and maintain their
intellectual property in China.
 Last January, 19 U.S. business groups representing
aerospace, telecommunication, software, clean energy and other
high-tech sectors put those concerns into a letter to U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner, Attorney General Eric Holder, Commerce Secretary Gary
Locke and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk.
 What prompted that action was a Chinese central government
proposal to establish a national catalogue listing which
products would be eligible for preferential treatment in
government procurement contracts.
 The groups told the five U.S. Cabinet officials that they
were alarmed by criteria that would require products included
in the catalogue to contain ""intellectual property that is
developed and owned in China and that any associated trademarks
are originally registered in China.""
 'NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE'
 ""This represents an unprecedented use of domestic
intellectual property as a market-access condition and makes it
nearly impossible for the products of American companies to
qualify unless they are prepared to establish Chinese brands
and transfer their research and development of new products to
China,"" the groups said.
 The issue also surfaced at the provincial and municipal
level in China.
 Shanghai issued its own catalogue of innovative products in
late 2009, and of ""the 530 on the list only two were made by
foreign-invested companies operating there,"" Frisbie said.
 ""And the two happened to be from joint ventures that had
majority-Chinese ownership too,"" Frisbie added.
 More than a year later, Shanghai has not updated its
catalogue -- which U.S. industry thinks illustrates the folly
of using product lists to promote innovation, Frisbie said.
 U.S. industry has urged China instead to use other
tried-and-true government policies such research and
development tax credits.
 U.S. officials raised the concerns with the Chinese and
made some progress in high-level talks with them last May in
Beijing and more at the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce
and Trade in December in Washington.
 At the second meeting, China pledged not to make the
location where cutting-edge technology is developed or owned a
condition for access to its government procurement market.
 But it saved its promise to completely sever its indigenous
innovation goals from government procurement for this week's
high-profile summit with President Barack Obama.
 Even so, the devil is in the details -- and U.S. business
will be watching closely in the coming months to see how China
implements the commitment.
 ""We hope China will make concrete changes to its indigenous
innovation regime at the central and provincial levels to live
up to this positive pledge,"" said Myron Brilliant, senior vice
president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
 Follow-through will be important because China has a habit
of taking action on one barrier only to erect another that is
just as formidable, said Bill Reinsch, president of the
National Foreign Trade Council business group.
 ""The thing to watch for is not them overtly ignoring their
promise, but trying to slip something else in through the back
door,"" Reinsch said.
 In a speech on Thursday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Locke said
he hoped for a future in which Chinese and American innovators
work ""side-by-side to develop breakthrough technologies in
sectors ranging from energy to biotechnology.""
 But Derek Scissors of the Heritage Foundation think tank
expressed skepticism.
 ""If we could wish for the moon, it would be an
unconditional pledge not to try to force technology transfer
from U.S. to Chinese companies in any way,"" Scissors said.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Global equities and commodity
prices fell on Thursday after robust Chinese economic growth
prompted fears the world's second-largest economy would try to
choke off excessive demand that is fueling inflation.
 Fears China would tighten monetary policy were felt across
multiple asset classes after the country's fourth-quarter gross
domestic product soared past forecasts, rising to 9.8 percent.
 A rise in U.S. financial shares, led by Morgan Stanley,
helped cut Wall Street's losses, although all three major
indexes fell. A disappointing outlook for F5 Networks -- a
leader in so-called cloud computing to move information away
from desktops and into remote centers -- contributed a negative
counterweight that dragged the Nasdaq market lower.
 ""The tug of war continued during the course of the day with
techs and financials -- the two big behemoths in terms of
bellwethers for the market -- slugging it out,"" Joseph Benanti,
managing director of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said
about the U.S. stock market moves.
 ""We had a lot of movement on hot news that will subside.
Cloud stocks are important, but they are not going to drive all
technology. And the financials are a bigger sector to follow
and are starting to hold their own.""
 The losses, while minor, extended Wednesday's intraday
decline for the broad S&P 500 stock index, the worst in nearly
two months.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell
2.49 points, or 0.02 percent, to 11,822.80. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 1.66 points, or 0.13 percent, at
1,280.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 21.07
points, or 0.77 percent, at 2,704.29.
 On the plus side, shares in No. 2 U.S. investment bank
Morgan Stanley , which posted a 60 percent increase in
quarterly profit, rose 4.57 percent to $29.02 a share.
 Among the U.S. networking/cloud stocks, F5 Networks
 fell 21.35 percent to $109.15 on weaker-than-expected
quarterly revenue and a gloomy forecast. [ID:nSGE70H0CM]
 Hit hard however by expectations China will ramp up
anti-inflationary measures were emerging market equities, down
1.55 percent <.MSCIEF>. Materials, mining and car companies
fell on concern demand from China's factories may slacken.
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc  lost 3.7 percent
to $110.90 after the copper producer trimmed its sales forecast
and said costs would rise. Ford Motor  fell 0.67 percent
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top

 DOLLAR GAINS
 A stronger-than-expected rise in existing home sales and a
fall in new claims for jobless benefits could not boost U.S.
stocks but did help lift the U.S. dollar.
 The euro managed to grab the edge back from the U.S. dollar
in late day trade, but the greenback advanced against a broad
basket of currencies made up of its major trading partners,
including the yen.
 Earlier on Thursday, the euro was supported by expectations
the European Union would come up with a comprehensive plan to
help debt-laden countries finance their overwhelming
obligations. [ID:nLDE70J1DW]
 The euro rose 0.04 percent at $1.3471 .
 ""We are finally seeing some growth and we have to at least
think about when the Federal Reserve will (tighten) policy,

head of G10 FX strategy at Nomura.

Canadian dollars and sterling,"" he said. The greenback has
struggled against all those currencies in recent months.
 The U.S. dollar index climbed 0.22 percent <.DXY>, while
the greenback rose 1.16 percent to 83.1 yen.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar gained more than 1

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 28/32, pushing
the yield up to 3.45 percent . The price decline
accelerated after a poorly received $13 billion sale of
inflation-protected Treasuries.

 NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday as
better-than-expected housing and employment data suggested the
U.S. economy was improving, though hopes Europe was getting a
handle on its debt crisis limited euro selling.
 Worries that China will try to choke off excessive growth
with higher interest rates also boosted the greenback by
sparking a sharp decline in the Australian and New Zealand
dollars. Australia exports natural resources to China, which

 The U.S. dollar has struggled against major currencies in
recent weeks and some say that decline coupled with signs of
stronger U.S. growth may spark a near-term rally.
 A sharp rise in existing U.S. home sales and a decline in
first-time jobless applications was a hopeful sign as high
unemployment and a depressed housing market are the biggest
obstacles to a robust recovery. [ID:nN20105802]

struggled against all those currencies in recent months.
 Signs of stronger growth also pushed bond yields higher on
Thursday, helping the dollar rise 1.2 percent to 83.03 yen
 and 1.3 percent to 0.9677 Swiss francs .
 The euro fell as low as $1.3396, though it recovered to
$1.3466 , unchanged on the day, and was within
striking distance of Wednesday's two-month high of $1.3539.
 The Aussie  fell 1.3 percent to $0.9870 while the
New Zealand currency shed 1.5 percent to $0.7579 .
 STILL EURO UPSIDE
 Among major currencies, the euro did best in holding its
ground against the greenback on Thursday. Sentiment has lately
favored the single currency, with persistent demand from
sovereign accounts affording euro-zone officials time to make
progress on finding a sustainable solution to a debt crisis.
 Euro zone officials were said to be considering letting the
European Financial Stability Facility, the bloc's bailout fund,
purchase or help finance the purchase of government debt from
troubled euro-zone nations. [ID:nLDE70J0CB]
 That has helped ease selling pressure on debt from Portugal
and Spain. Technical analysts said the euro's ability to
rebound from a brief dip below its $1.3435 100-day moving
average was a bullish sign.
 Investors still worry that high financing needs in Spain
and Portugal could push both to seek emergency rescue funds.
Ratings agency Fitch said more bailouts of the sort given to
Ireland and Greece are still a high risk. [ID:nLDE70J206]
But if euro zone leaders manage to get things under control,
investor anxiety may shift elsewhere.
 ""If the market starts to sense that Spain risk is lower,
then all of a sudden....it's going to be back to (thinking)
what's the one country in the world that has yet to come up
with a fiscal adjustment, and that's the United States,"" said
Kevin Daly, who helps oversee about $6 billion in assets at

 * Chairman says he detects new spirit
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - WTO members are getting down to
the technicalities of a new global trade deal, suggesting the
right spirit of compromise to clinch agreement may at last be
within reach, negotiators and officials said on Thursday.
 Swiss ambassador Luzius Wasescha, who chairs talks at the
World Trade Organization on industrial goods, said after a week
of meetings that he detected a changed mood, which was the
prerequisite for movement in the long-running Doha negotiations.
 He said members had finally started to talk about issues and
proposals that had not been discussed so far.
 ""This is not the end of the final phase but the beginning of
what might evolve into a final phase,"" he told a briefing.
 WTO members have launched an intensive push to conclude the
nine-year-old Doha round to free up world trade this year.
 Trade ministers from Australia, Brazil, China, the European
Union, India, Japan and the United States will meet on Jan. 28
on the sidelines of the annual gathering of political and
business leaders in Davos to discuss the Doha talks.
 A broader group of 20 or so trade ministers will meet in the
Swiss resort the following day, also to review Doha.
 The WTO's 153 members will then review progress back in
Geneva on Feb. 2, one trade diplomat said.
 Whether this year's efforts will in the end join a long list
of missed deadlines, as differences between rich and emerging
economies about opening up markets prove irreconcilable, remains
to be seen.
 But the effort to reach a deal is certainly being made, with
negotiators and officials complaining of the punishing work
schedule at WTO headquarters by Lake Geneva.
 
 MORE DIRECTION
 Negotiators said the long-deadlocked talks were at last
showing some signs of movement but said it was much too soon to
say they were finally on the right track.
 ""There's a long way to go. People are waiting to see what's
going to happen in Davos next week,"" said a senior diplomat from
a large developed economy.
 ""There's still some need for ministerial direction,"" agreed
a diplomat from a medium-sized emerging country.
 This week's industrial goods talks have focused on how to
free up trade by removing non-tariff barriers -- safety and
health standards and other rules that can be abused to block the
flow of commerce.
 Such barriers are of increasing importance now that tariffs
themselves are fairly low in many countries.
 One example is a proposal to set up a ""horizontal mechanism""
to defuse problems arising from the whole spectrum of non-tariff
barriers without resorting to the WTO's more formal dispute
settlement system.
 The United States had previously opposed the idea
altogether, but now accepts there is overwhelming support among
other members and is trying to shape the proposal instead, said
one trade official.
 ""In the horizontal mechanism we are already talking wording,
which means the whole thing is moving,"" he said.
 Wasescha said some members had held bilateral talks on a
sectoral agreement in chemicals outside the meetings he chaired.
 Sectorals, where a group of countries would sign up to a
deal eliminating tariffs in a specific industrial sector beyond
any overall cuts in duties that are agreed, are a central demand
of the United States, which wants big emerging economies like
China, Brazil and India to take part.
 The proposal was one of the issues over which the last push
to reach agreement on Doha, in July 2008, foundered.
 Washington says China, long sceptical towards sectorals, has
signalled a willingness to discuss them.
 Australia and the United Arab Emirates also put forward a
proposal for a new sectoral agreement in raw materials, the
trade official said.

 * Futures could be more closely aligned with physical
 * Hetco trading play has revived benchmark debate
 
 By Barbara Lewis
 LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A change to the Brent futures
contract could help prevent dominant trading positions on the
physical North Sea market, a director at price assessment agency
Platts said.
 Jorge Montepeque, a director at the McGraw Hill unit, said
that could be a better solution than adding more crude streams
to the four grades already used to underpin Brent futures
trading on the IntercontinentalExchange.
 However, Platts has not ruled out that option.
 ""We are open to adding additional barrels when we have some
signals in the market place that this is required,"" Montepeque
told Reuters in a telephone interview, but he said he did not
see a case for now.
 Instead he referred to a meeting at which Platts had stated
""the architecture of the Brent mechanism was less than optimum"".
 ""It results in only about 70-75 percent of the available wet
cargoes underpinning the futures contract,"" he said.
 Montepeque argued the timing of the futures expiry could be
brought more into line with loadings on the physical crude
market.
 That would imply expiration of the front-month contract near
the end of the month or close to the start of the following
month, rather than roughly mid-month as happens now.
 ""I know that a lot of brains are thinking about this,""
Montepeque added.
 Platts, an assessor of crude and product prices, oversaw the
addition of Forties and Oseberg to the dwindling Brent stream in
2002 to widen the physical basis for Brent futures following a
series of trading plays.
 As production of the mature North Sea grades fell further,
Ekofisk was added in 2007 to the benchmark grades that help to
price more than two thirds of the world's physical crude.
 
 HETCO'S DOMINANT POSITION
 The issue of whether further declines in output and
increased volumes of trade on the futures market require further
change has been revived after trading house Hetco this month
acquired a dominant position on the North Sea crude market.
 It took control of almost one third of the monthly programme
of Forties.
In total the four benchmark crudes amount to roughly 1.2
million barrels per day. That compared with Brent crude futures
trade on Jan. 18 of around 500 million barrels.
 Brent crude has maintained an unusual premium to U.S. crude
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) since
August last year.
 Last Friday when the front-month contract expired, that
premium rose to more than $8, its widest since February 2009.
 It also extended its premium over the second-month March
contract, now the front-month to more than $1.
 Hetco at the same time was a very active buyer of
exchange-for-physical paper instruments, used when converting
paper derivatives into physical cargoes.
 Relative to other crudes, Montepeque said ""the signal from
Brent was a little bit too strong"", although the strength came
from a variety of factors.
 Brent's rise also coincided with the shift of more
investment class money into the contract following the
re-weighting of commodity indexes towards Brent and away from
U.S. crude.
 The U.S. contract meanwhile has been weakened by levels of
inventory at Cushing, Okhlahoma, the delivery point for NYMEX
futures.
 No-one from ICE had any comment on Thursday. In an interview
earlier this month, a senior executive from the exchange said
Brent was a highly useful benchmark and its strength was a
function of U.S. crude weakness.

 * Experts say efforts unlikely to change perceptions in US
 * Polls find Americans with mixed feelings toward of China
 By Kristina Cooke
 NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Seeking to soften its image
among Americans, China has paid for a promotional video to
appear on six giant screens in New York's Times Square and on
CNN, but experts doubt the campaign will change perceptions in
the United States.
 The launch of the one-minute video, which state-run news
agency Xinhua called part of a ""public diplomacy campaign,""
coincides with President Hu Jintao's state visit to the United
States.
 It is China's latest effort to bolster its so-called ""soft
power"" -- exerting influence through culture and lifestyle
rather than coercion, experts said.
 The advertisement features a wide range of Chinese people
-- including basketball star Yao Ming, pianist Lang Lang,
astronaut Yang Liwei, supermodels and ordinary, smiling
citizens -- in a video with banners touting Chinese wealth,
talent, bravery and beauty.
 China, whose use of soft power began in earnest when it
hosted the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, is spending billions of
dollars to boost its image abroad including through Confucius
Institutes that teach Chinese language and culture, according
to Joseph Nye, a Harvard University professor of international
relations.
 Confucius Institutes are located in various places around
the world, including in the United States.
 ""This campaign (the promotional videos) is consistent with
their soft power efforts,"" Nye said. ""It's useful for them to
do, but I don't think it will have a huge effect.""
 Nye said such campaigns are undercut by China's actions
like jailing human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, who won the
Nobel Peace Prize last year.
 Thomas Cromwell, an expert who specializes in nation
""branding,"" said Americans already are exposed to many messages
that have shaped their perceptions about China.
 ""A simple rebranding of this nature is not likely to
achieve significant changes in perception,"" said Cromwell,
president of Washington-based East West Communications.
 ""The campaign does not address the core international
concerns about China, even tangentially.""
 Opinion polls indicate that Americans are split in their
views of China, with concern expressed about Chinese human
rights practices, trade policies and environmental record.
 A Pew Research Center poll this month found that just 22
percent of Americans called China an ""adversary"" but 43 percent
saw it as a ""serious problem."" An earlier Pew poll found that
49 percent of Americans express a favorable opinion of China,
while 36 percent felt unfavorably.
 CHINA AS A THREAT
 Ahead of last November's U.S. congressional elections, some
politicians aired campaign ads portraying China as a threat.
 U.S. lawmakers accuse China of keeping its exports
artificially cheap and taking U.S. jobs. The United States also
wants China to allow its currency, the yuan, to rise more
rapidly to help shrink Washington's trade deficit.
 Countries often pay to air television advertisements in
other nations to try to bolster their image to attract tourists
and investment. For example, after the Balkan conflicts in the
1990s, Croatia promoted its beaches and quaint towns to rebrand
itself as a tourist destination.
 The Chinese video will be shown 300 times daily in Times
Square until Feb. 14 and will run on CNN, the cable television
news network, through Feb. 13, according to Xinhua.
 Reactions of people who saw the video on giant screens by a
plaza in Times Square where tourists come to buy Broadway show
tickets were mixed.
 ""They are just like us,"" Mike Walsh, 53, from Baltimore,
who was in New York to go to a Broadway show, said after seeing
the video.
 Donna Perluke, 47, from New Jersey said that while the
video projected a positive image of China she could not ignore
""how they treat their own people.""
 Sun Tie, 53, who said he recently moved to New York from
China, came to Times Square especially to see the ad. ""I'm very
happy because China looks very handsome,"" he said.

 LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Sweden's government is monitoring
rising housing prices but there is no sign yet that the
country's strong economic recovery is at risk of causing
overheating, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said on Thursday.
 Sweden's finance minister raised his forecast for economic
growth this year to close to 4 percent on Wednesday, and said

historic low interest rates and low building starts. The growth
has raised worries that a house price crash could come next.
 Asked if he saw signs of overheating, Reinfeldt told Reuters
in an interview: ""That is always the risk if you have very high
growth figures.""
 But he added ""we still see that we have free capacity in the
Swedish economy for our growth. We are looking at asset markets,
especially in private homes, and follow that very closely, but
for the moment I think most people will say 'no, there is still
capacity for Sweden to grow'.""
 ""Since we have done a lot of labour reforms, we have never
had so many people who actually want to have a job in Sweden and
of course that kind of capacity is very important,"" he said,
speaking after a London summit involving the prime ministers of
Britain, Nordic and Baltic countries.
 The Deputy Governor of Sweden's central bank, Barbro
Wickman-Parak said on Thursday that Sweden had avoided a housing
bubble despite some over-valuation, but the bank was keeping an
eye on developments.
 The resurgent economy has boosted the Swedish crown to
seven-year highs against the euro and analysts expect more
moderate gains for the currency this year, helped by interest
rate rises at a time when euro zone monetary policy is on hold.
Reinfeldt said the strong crown affected the export
industry.
 The traditional view in Sweden had been that a weak currency
helped the economy, ""but it hasn't been much of a help because
what happens is you tend to be lazy and not reform yourself.""
 ""With an emphasis on productivity which we have seen in
Swedish industry, we can be more competitive even with a
stronger Swedish krone,"" he said.
 The Swedish government was helping companies by cutting
taxes and red tape, so that, on balance, ""they see an increasing
potential for staying in Sweden and growing in Sweden,"" he said.
 Sweden's strong growth and sound public finances are in
sharp contrast to the economic woes facing much of Europe.
 Referring to the euro zone debt crisis, he said ""inside the
European Union it is very important that what is now happening
is not seen as a battle with the market or something like that.""
 ""We need to do more on the reform side throughout Europe to
be competitive,"" he said.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Global equities and commodity
prices fell on Thursday after robust Chinese economic growth
prompted fears the world's second-largest economy would try to
choke off excessive demand that is fueling inflation.
 Measures to fight price increases, such as tightening
monetary policy, were felt across multiple asset classes after
China's fourth-quarter gross domestic product soared past
forecasts, rising to 9.8 percent.
 U.S. earnings disappointments added to the gloom on Wall
Street, extending the worst intraday decline for the broad S&P
500 stock index in nearly two months.
 ""Earnings expectations have been very high, and the market
has not been able to see enough positive news to keep prices at
these high levels,"" said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global
in Chicago.
 A stronger-than-expected rise in existing home sales and a
fall in new claims for jobless benefits could not boost U.S.
stocks but did help lift the U.S. dollar.
 The euro struggled to regain its footing against the
greenback after the data, having earlier gained on expectations
the European Union would come up with a comprehensive plan to
help debt-laden countries finance their overwhelming
obligations.
 Emerging market equities led the stock selloff, while
materials, mining and car companies were the worst hit by
concerns of a potential slackening in demand from China's
factories.
 MSCI's emerging markets stock index fell 1.64 percent
<.MSCIEF> while the broader All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> lost 1.14 percent.
 At midday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> fell 29.29 points, or 0.25 percent, at 11,796.00. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 4.72 points, or 0.37
percent, at 1,277.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
dropped 27.41 points, or 1.01 percent, at 2,697.95. 
 Among the U.S. networking/cloud stocks, F5 Networks tumbled
nearly 22 percent at $108.49 on weaker-than-expected quarterly
revenue and a gloomy forecast. [ID:nSGE70H0CM]
 On the plus side, No. 2 U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley
, which posted a 60 percent increase in quarterly profit,
rose 3.53 percent to $28.73 a share.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed down 1.11 percent at 1,139.63 points - its lowest
since Jan. 11.
 Mining and material stocks suffered, including Alcoa
, off 1.93 percent. European miners closed sharply lower.
Anglo American , Antofagasta , BHP Billiton
 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation ,
lost between 3.56 percent and 4.72 percent.
 Ford Motor  dropped 1.45 percent, off its lows of the

percent and 3 percent, respectively.
 ""A lot of Asian economies, and especially China, (are)
overheating. People have invested heavily in commodity shares
and any disappointing news might provoke a ... correction,""
said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis

 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed 1.1 percent lower.
 Oil prices fell 2.41 percent to $88.67 a barrel in New

 DOLLAR STRENGTH
 The U.S. economic data helped to propel the dollar higher
against other major currencies. The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>
rose 0.27 percent.
 The euro dropped against the greenback, trading at $1.3463,
down 0.02 percent . The dollar rose 1.12 percent to 82.98

 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar gained more than 1
percent to 0.9670 francs .
 Despite its weakness, the euro was supported by a generally
optimistic view that the European Union's rescue fund (EFSF)
will ultimately offer a comprehensive solution to help
euro-zone countries finance mounting debts. [ID:nLDE70J1DW]
 That fueled hopes the region's rescue fund could enable
buybacks of those states' bonds. As a result, core German debt
prices weakened.
 The Bund future  sank to 123.78, its lowest since
mid-April 2010 and down roughly half a point on the day.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 17/32, pushing

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The dollar gained broadly on
Thursday as an array of U.S. data suggested the U.S. economy is
firmly on a path of recovery, but growing confidence in
Europe's ability to defuse its debt crisis should limit the
greenback's gains against the euro.
 High unemployment and a lackluster housing market are the
biggest obstacles to the U.S. economy's recovery, but
stronger-than-expected data on jobless claims and existing home
sales provided a glimmer of hope. For details, click on table
and.
 U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy largely relies on
labor market conditions and the pace of the economic recovery,
so signs of improvement increase expectations of higher
interest rates, which makes the dollar more appealing to
investors.
 ""Most of the reports today were fairly good. For anyone
skeptical about the U.S. recovery, these should ease concern,""
said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in New
York.
 ""It suggests the U.S. economy is moving in the right
direction and investors are buying the dollar, as there are
concerns outside U.S. borders,"" she said. ""The combination of
strong U.S. and Chinese data today is something to be
optimistic about.""
 The dollar's biggest gains were against its safe-haven
rival currencies.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar gained 1.1 percent to
0.9656 francs. The greenback rose to session highs against the
yen to 82.98 on electronic trading platform EBS. It last traded
at 82.91.
 The euro fell as low as $1.3396 on trading platform EBS and
was last trading at $1.3454, down 0.1 percent. The euro had hit
a two-month high on Wednesday of $1.3539.
 Sentiment lately has favored the single currency, with the
dollar underperforming the euro in seven of the past nine
sessions. The euro is up 0.6 percent so far this year, largely
because of persistent demand from sovereign accounts, as
investors give euro-zone officials time to make progress on
finding a sustainable solution to its debt crisis.
 Investors have grown more optimistic that EU officials
could finally be working on a plan to address debt problems in
the bloc's peripheral countries.
 Officials are said to be mulling a plan that would allow
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the bloc's
bailout fund, to directly purchase or help finance the purchase
of government debt from troubled euro-zone nations.
 ""Concrete efforts by EU officials to get ahead of the
bloc's debt crisis could meaningfully improve the single
currency's outlook and help it sustain and even add to its
recent gains,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""However, until such steps are taken by euro zone
policymakers, the euro's rally is likely to be viewed as
lacking sustainability,"" he said.
 The Financial Times Deutschland on Thursday said euro-area
finance ministers discussed a plan to ease pressure on Greece
by allowing it to buy back its own debt using credits from the
EFSF.
 Technical analysts said the single currency would be
supported around $1.3435, its 100-day moving average, while
upward resistance was seen at $1.3570, the 50-percent
retracement of the euro's November-to-January slide.
 European stock markets took a cue from selling in Asian
equities, after data showing stellar economic growth in China
in 2010 fueled speculation that Beijing may come under more
pressure to tighten monetary policy.
 Higher-yielding currencies, including the Australian and
Zealand dollars, were the day's biggest losers, falling 1.3
percent and 1.6 percent versus the dollar respectively.
 The Australian dollar is particularly sensitive to the
performance of the Chinese economy as Australia is a major
supplier of natural resources to China. Speculation of higher
Chinese rates tends to weaken the Aussie as such action would
cool growth, decreasing demand for resources.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent versus a currency basket to
78.880 from a two-month low of 78.303 hit on Wednesday.

 * Says economic growth to slow significantly due to franc

 * Danthine says strong franc tightens monetary conditions
 
 (Adds Danthine comments, ZEW, franc)
 By Sven Egenter and Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH/LAUSANNE, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Switzerland's economy is
still in robust shape despite an unprecedentedly strong Swiss
franc that is a big burden for some sectors, Swiss National Bank
chairman Philipp Hildebrand said on Thursday.
In the text of a speech due for delivery at the Club of Rome
Forum in Zurich, Hildebrand reviewed the financial crisis and
actions taken by central banks.
 ""The indicators point to an overall still lively economic
activity in our country,"" Hildebrand said.
 While the current situation gave reason for optimism, the
fallout from the global crisis was still evident.
 The euro zone debt crisis was driving up the franc and the
SNB was therefore forecasting a significant slowdown for the
local economy, he said. Overall, the environment was still
fraught with major uncertainties.
 Speaking at a conference in the Swiss city of Lausanne, SNB
board member Jean-Pierre Danthine said the strong franc was
tightening monetary conditions in Switzerland.
 ""So, of course that has implications ... It would be logical
that you don't want to make them tighter.""
 The SNB is widely expected to hold interest rates at
ultra-low levels at least until mid-2011 as higher rates would
strengthen the currency further.<0#FES:>
 
 EURO ZONE KEY
 The Swiss franc extended its recent decline on Thursday,
falling more than 1 percent on the day and trading around 1.30
per euro. However, this is still a historically high level and
not too far off its record around 1.24 hit in December.
 ""Importers are benefiting from the rise in the Swiss franc
over the past months,"" Hildebrand said. ""But for parts of our
economy it is a big burden. The euro zone's stability is
absolutely key for the Swiss franc and the Swiss economy
overall.
 ""I am confident that the EU will master the challenges,"" he
added.
 Hildebrand's comments echo SNB's latest policy statement
from Dec. 16 and remarks from vice-chairman Thomas Jordan last
week.[ID:nLDE70B2EX]
 The SNB forecast Swiss economic growth to slow to around 1.5
percent in 2011 from some 2.5 percent last year.
 The Swiss ZEW investor survey on Thursday showed that more
investors considered the economic situation as good. But a
growing majority saw a cooling of the Alpine economy.
[ID:nZCHJCE75D]
 Business leaders and trade unions have warned that the
strength of the franc was hitting exporters hard and could cost
thousands of jobs. The unions in particular have called on the
SNB to resume interventions to fight the currency's strength.
 But the central bank has also come under fire as it had to
book some 26 billion Swiss francs ($27.22 billion) in losses on
its currency reserves, built up during massive interventions
between March 2009 and June 2010, endangering levels of payouts
to the government.
 Hildebrand defended the interventions, saying they were
necessary at the time to fend off the risk of deflation. He said
decisions about interventions were solely based on the SNB's
mandate to ensure price stability.
 ""We have always emphasised that the SNB's goal is not to
make a profit -- or even speculate,"" he said.
 Hildebrand said a couple of months of falling prices did not
amount to deflation. ""Deflation is defined as a lasting decline
in prices caused by a slump in demand,"" he said.

 * Revenue up more than expected
 
 (Updates with details, background)
 By Daniel Alvarenga
 LISBON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Portugal looks likely to have
beaten its 2010 budget deficit target, its finance minister said
on Thursday, as the country sought to fend off pressure to ask
for an international bailout.
 Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told reporters that
the 2010 deficit was likely to have been below the government's
goal of 7.3 percent of gross domestic product. 
 Teixeira dos Santos also said that state sector budget data
released earlier on Thursday gave the government a ""solid base""
to conclude that last year's budget deficit goal was beaten.
 The finance ministry's budget office said state sector
revenues in 2010 rose 4.6 percent, more than planned in the
budget, while expenditure rose 3.7 percent, which was less than
forecast. The core state sector deficit rose last year to 14.25
billion euros ($19.22 billion) from 2009's 14.057 billion euros,
it said.
 Prime Minister Jose Socrates' government is struggling to
avoid the fate of Greece and Ireland, which were both forced to
accept rescues last year from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund.
 Socrates insists no help is necessary and aims to cut the
budget deficit this year to 4.6 percent of GDP through civil
servant salary cuts and tax hikes.
 Many economists still expect Portugal to capitulate to
market pressure and ask for help from the euro zone bailout
fund. They fear the contagion will spread to much bigger Spain,
whose banks are heavily exposed to Portugal. A bailout for Spain
could empty the EU's emergency coffers.
 Finance Minister Teixeira dos Santos also said he supports
proposals for the role of the European Financial Stability
Facility -- the euro zone's rescue chest -- to be widened to
include potential purchases of government bonds and that its
size be increased. 
 The premiums investors demand to hold Portuguese and other
lower-rated euro zone bonds fell to their lowest in around a
month on Thursday on hopes that reforms to the rescue fund could
enable buybacks of their bonds.

 * Shekel sheds 1.7 pct but rally seen continuing in long run
 * Move seen helping central bank raise interest rates
 
 (Adds analysts' quotes, background)
 By Tova Cohen
 TEL AVIV, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Israel on Wednesday became the
latest country to combat speculative money flows which have
strengthened its currency when it imposed a reserve requirement
on some foreign exchange derivative deals.
 From Jan. 27, banks in Israel will have to meet a 10 percent
reserve requirement on the value of foreign exchange swaps and
forwards transactions by non-residents, the Bank of Israel said,
as it seeks to protect exports and contain inflation.
 ""In the last few months the volume of foreign exchange
derivative transactions by non-residents has increased
markedly,"" the Bank of Israel said.
 ""A significant part of the increase in non-residents'
transactions is in short-term instruments. This measure will
strengthen the Bank of Israel's ability to achieve the
objectives of its monetary, foreign exchange and financial
stability policies.""
 In December foreigners made swaps worth $76 billion compared
with $19 billion by Israelis and up from $59 billion in
November.
 The shekel weakened to 3.62 shekels per dollar from 3.56
prior to the announcement.
The Bank of Israel is trying the reduce the amount of
speculative capital flows by imposing a liquidity requirement of
10 percent of the value of the transaction, Ron Eichel, chief
economist at Meitav Investment House, said.
 ""This can change short-term trends and reduce noise in the
market but if the economic fundamentals are strong, in the end
the currency will strengthen,"" Eichel told Reuters.
 ""Israel is like Brazil and other countries, it is trying to
help exports and growth.""
 Brazil, Chile, Peru, Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey, South
Africa and others have taken measures to keep their currencies
from strengthening or control the flow of money into their
economies as investors pour money into higher-yielding markets.

 SHEKEL WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN
 The shekel reached a 27-month high of 3.528 shekels per
dollar earlier this month and the Bank of Israel has intervened
repeatedly to contain the currency's rally. It bought $2.3
billion of foreign currency in December, bringing its forex
reserves to a record $70.9 billion.
 Eichel said the shekel will continue to strengthen in the
long term even without speculators because economic growth is
strong, interest rates are expected to rise and there is a
surplus in the country's balance of payments. Israel's economy
grew a provisional 4.5 percent in 2010.
 ""I don't think anyone in the Bank of Israel is innocent
enough to believe this will change the trend,"" Eichel said.
 Fourteen of 15 economists polled by Reuters expect the
central bank to raise its short-term lending rate by 0.25
percentage point to 2.25 percent on Monday. The rate is expected
to reach 3.0-3.5 percent by the end of 2011.
 Michael Sarel, head of economic research at Harel Finance,
said even a short-term depreciation of the shekel will enable
the central bank to raise rates more rapidly.
 ""We estimate that in the wake of the Bank of Israel's
measure, the chances for a rate hike on Monday have increased
considerably and the rate of increases in the interest rate in
the coming year is expected to be more rapid,"" Sarel said.
 A Bank of Israel source said the reserves measure will make
this type of transaction less attractive for foreign players.
 ""It makes the transaction more expensive for local banks,""
the source said, as the banks will not get interest on the 10
percent reserves and this will carry over to foreign banks.
 The Bank of Israel's order follows its announcement on
Wednesday that it will require Israelis and foreigners to report
on transactions in foreign exchange swaps and forwards of more
than $10 million in one day.
 Additionally, non-residents who perform transactions in
short-term Bank of Israel bills known as makams and short-term
government bonds of more than 10 million shekels in one day will
be required to report details of the transactions and their
balance of holdings of such assets.

 NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the
euro on Thursday as stronger-than-expected U.S. labor market
data buoyed demand for the greenback, but growing confidence in
Europe's ability to defuse its debt crisis should limit gains.
 High unemployment and a lackluster housing market are the
biggest obstacles to the U.S. economy's recovery. The path of
U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy largely relies on labor
market conditions, so signs of improvement tend to increase
expectations of higher interest rates.
 U.S. initial jobless claims fell more than expected last
week and showed their biggest decline since February.
 The greenback rose as high as 82.69 yen, the day's peak, on
electronic trading platform EBS from 82.36 yen before the
data.
 The euro fell 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.3452,
according to Reuters data, after hitting a two-month high on
Wednesday of $1.3539.
 Sentiment lately has favored the single currency, with the
dollar underperforming the euro in seven of the past nine

finance ministers discussed a plan to ease pressure on Greece
by allowing it to buy back its own debt using credits from the

 ""The markets remain fairly calm and are giving the
euro-zone authorities the benefit of the doubt for now, buying
the euro on the back of its favorable yield differential
relative to the dollar,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research
director at FOREX.com.
 Key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rates rose on
Thursday, as markets continued to digest last week's inflation
warning from the European Central Bank, lending support to the
euro.
 Technical analysts said the single currency would be
supported around $1.3435, its 100-day moving average, while
upward resistance was seen at $1.3570, the 50-percent
retracement of the euro's November-to-January slide.
 European stock markets took a cue from selling in Asian
equities, after data showing stellar economic growth in China
in 2010 fueled speculation that Beijing may come under more
pressure to tighten monetary policy.
 Analysts said risk appetite was tempered as investors
waited to see how a visit by Chinese President Hu Jintao to the
United States may affect Beijing's policy of holding down the
value of the yuan.
 Higher-yielding currencies, including the Australian and
Zealand dollars, were the day's biggest losers, falling 1.2
percent and 1.5 percent versus the dollar respectively.
 The Australian dollar is particularly sensitive to the
performance of the Chinese economy as Australia is a major

 The dollar rose 0.1 percent versus a currency basket to

 Data on U.S. December existing home sales to be released at

4.8 percent, may sway U.S. dollar sentiment.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2011 09:28AM ET</span>",OECD head: debt-hit euro lands need time to repay," STOCKHOLM, Jan 20 (Reuters) - European countries with the
heaviest debt burdens should not be forced to pay back borrowing
too rapidly if confidence-damaging credit restructuring is to be
avoided, the head of the OECD said on Thursday.
 Bond markets are worried that Greece and Ireland, in
particular, could default on their debts or need to restructure
payments which would undermine stability in the euro zone.
 A euro zone source said on Thursday the bloc is considering
allowing the European Financial Stability Facility to buy back
the bonds of member states in trouble as part of a broader

 At a news conference in Stockholm, Angel Gurria,
Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) called for Europe's hardest hit countries
to be given sufficient time to repay their debts.
 Asked if debt restructuring was inevitable for some European
countries, Gurria said: ""No, nothing is inevitable. It depends
on the success of the policies, and it depends on the
appropriateness of the rescheduling.""
 ""But, if you do a bad rescheduling, or if you force a
country to start paying a very large amount of debt too soon,
then restructuring may be inevitable because you force a
situation on a country that is not yet ready to generate the
surpluses...in order to be able to pay large chunks of debt.""
 European finance ministers have been trying this week to
beef up the euro zone's 440 billion euro rescue fund. Markets
want to see more money available for the fund because they
estimate the current amount would not be sufficient if both
Portugal and Spain applied for emergency financing.
 Many in the markets expect that Greece's debt, which is set
to peak at 157 percent of its gross domestic product in 2013,
may be too high for the country to repay entirely.
 Yields on Irish bonds  remain sky-high amid
concerns future bank losses and a bloated budget deficit will
prove too much and it too could default. [ID:nLDE7060J7]
 Both Ireland and Greece have been bailed out by the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund. Some analysts expect
Portugal and Spain to have to follow them in seeking aid.

 * Hungarian, Polish budget measures seen carrying risks
 * Details of reform plans awaited for both countries
 
 By Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Investor concerns about soaring
budget deficits in Europe may shift eastwards to Hungary and
possibly Poland unless both countries back up one-off fiscal
measures that have already unnerved economists with more durable
reforms.
 From the Baltics to the Black Sea, the European Union's
eastern members are struggling to close fiscal gaps to avoid the
type of market backlash that has driven bond yields to record
highs on the euro zone's periphery.
 So far they have largely sidestepped the turmoil, drawing
strong portfolio flows from investors fleeing very low interest
rates in the developed world in favour of higher yields.
 But with the government in the region's biggest economy,
Poland, eschewing fiscal cuts ahead of an autumn election, and
Hungary's centre-right cabinet pursing a pro-growth strategy
that rejects austerity, economists say risks are rising.
 ""For the time being markets are focused on the troubles in
the euro zone's periphery, and fiscal concerns in Eastern Europe
- particularly in Poland - have slipped under the radar,"" said
Neil Shearing, an economist at London-based Capital Economics.
 ""The risk is that if and when the market's attention shifts
from Portugal, investors could start focus on those countries in
the region that have so far talked a good game on fiscal
austerity but yet to push through meaningful reforms.""
 While euro zone policymakers step up efforts to contain the
region's debt crisis, analysts are looking forward to two events
further east. [ID:nLDE70J1DW]
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is expected to
announce the details of a deficit reduction package next month. 
 And in Poland, all eyes are on whether Prime Minister Donald
Tusk will tackle structural reforms following an autumn election
he is expected to win.
 A European Commission spokesman said on Thursday the EU
executive had asked Poland for details of how it plans to cut
the deficit amid doubts over whether it can meet an agreed
deadline to trim the gap to below the bloc's 3 percent of gross
domestic product limit by the end of 2012. [ID:nLDE70J1CL]
 
 FALLING DEFICITS
 Economists say that, on paper, Hungary is at the vanguard of
deficit reduction efforts. It will become one of the EU's only
countries to hit the 3 percent target this year.
 But it will do that with a series of one-off revenue
boosting plans that include appropriating up to $14 billion in
private pension assets and big taxes on banks and other mostly
foreign-owned industries to cover its public spending shortfall.
 Another is the government's outlook. It expects growth of 3
percent in 2011 and 3.5 percent in 2012, accelerating to 5-5.5
percent in 2013-2015. That compares with European Commission
forecasts of 2.8 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 2012.
 This week, a Hungarian government official said Budapest
would reveal a plan next month to trim 600 to 660 billion
forints ($3.24 billion) from fiscal gaps in 2011-2013.
[ID:nLDE70I0UU]
 Investors said the structure of the plan was vital and if
not deemed adequate, the market would punish Budapest, which has
seen its 10-year bond yields rise 1 percentage point to 7.75
percent since Orban won last year's election and is now rated a
notch above ""junk"" by all three major ratings agencies.
 ""If they don't deliver it could be very negative for
Hungarian assets,"" said RBC strategist Nigel Rendell.
 
 CONCERN OVER POLAND
 Markets have been relatively bullish on the two countries
this year. The Polish zloty  is up 1.75 percent, and
the Hungarian forint 1.9 percent. 
 Poland, the only country to avoid recession during the
crisis, aims to cut its deficit under its EU convergence plan by
a third this year and to 3 percent of GDP by 2012, from last
year's forecast 7.9 percent.
 But analysts say those measures are based less on tackling
big structural imbalances and more on boosting revenues and
relying on an outlook for strong growth.
 It will plug its 2011 budget hole with a $5 billion zloty
privatisation campaign and will roll back one of its most
successful post-communist economic reforms by shifting some of
the $8 billion a year in private pension contributions back to
state coffers to cover public spending. [ID:nnLDE6B51LL]
 This week, Anne-Marie Gulde, a senior adviser at the
International Monetary Fund's European department, said there
was ""an undefined structural adjustment needed to meet the
deficit reduction programme target"" for Poland -- meaning it
would miss its 2012 goal without more action. [ID:n:LDE70H18I]
 ""We are certainly concerned in all countries there is a
tendency to do one-off measures,"" she said.
 According to the European Commission, Poland's 2011
cyclically adjusted net borrowing -- its fiscal deficit minus
temporary measures like crisis-related unemployment costs --
will be 6.1 percent of GDP, versus 3.9 percent for the Czechs,
3.7 percent for Hungary and a euro zone average of 3.5.
 That could cause a sharp market reaction if Tusk's
government does not address the budget's structural imbalances.
 ""Once the Polish election has been and gone, the market will
demand some fairly big fiscal measures,"" Rendell said. ""You can
brush these things under the carpet for so long, but... if they
don't Poland could find itself out of favour pretty quickly.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2011 08:00AM ET</span>",Euro zone mulls bond buy-backs in crisis response-source," * Discussion is part of effort to broaden EFSF's capability
 * Proposal among others being weighed as part of new package
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The euro zone is considering
allowing the European Financial Stability Facility to buy back
the bonds of member states in trouble as part of a broader
response to the sovereign debt crisis, a euro zone source said.
 The EFSF is a special purpose vehicle that can borrow money
against government guarantees and lend it to a euro zone country
cut off from market financing, in exchange for a tough programme
of fiscal consolidation and structural reform.
 The 17 countries that share the euro are in discussions
about raising the EFSF's effective lending capacity, from around
250 billion euros closer to its 440 billion euro ceiling, while
also broadening how the funds can be used.
 The changes are part of a package of new measures that the
euro zone is expected to announce by mid-March as it tries to
draw a line under the sovereign debt crisis, which has forced
Greece and Ireland to seek EU and IMF financial help.
 Under the proposal being discussed, the EFSF would be able
to buy the bonds of a distressed country in the secondary
market, which could help stabilise that country's bond market.
 ""This option has always been on the table as a part of the
'comprehensive package',"" a euro zone source with knowledge of
the discussions told Reuters on Thursday.
 ""It was discussed only in general under the heading of
'broadening the scope of EFSF activities', not in relation to
any specific country,"" the source said. 
 The source said the potential buy-backs would not be a
stand-alone measure, but part of a broader programme of
consolidation and reform agreed with the troubled country.
 ""The buy-backs could be provided in combination with a loan
or recapitalisation of banks in the recipient country, for
example,"" the source said.
 While no decisions have been taken so far and more technical
talks are likely over the coming weeks on various options, there
was some support for the idea among euro zone officials.
 ""It was one of the options more seriously considered. Some
people were quite pushing this. I think technically it would be
the EFSF buying back the bonds and then somehow swapping them
against new issuance,"" the source said.
 The source said the idea was discussed separately from a
proposal to allow the EFSF to buy bonds of countries
experiencing market stress on the secondary market, as the
European Central Bank is currently doing.
 ""I think the bond buying programme is something else, at
least purchases on the secondary market and buybacks were
discussed as a separate point,"" the source said.
 The source said the Commission had argued that under present
financing conditions countries under market stress would not
benefit that much from such an ECB-style bond buy-back
programme.
 But the source also said opposition to this idea could be
rooted in concern about the potential losses it could mean for
euro zone banks which have invested heavily in, for example,
Greek or Irish paper and would lose money selling those assets
more cheaply via buy-backs at current market rates.
 ""I think it is politically easier to say we are saving the
euro than to give a lot of money to banks at the time when
budgets are being tightened,"" the source said.
 ""Although the amounts needed to recapitalise them would
probably be much smaller than the money needed to bail out
everyone against whom these banks have an exposure,"" the source
said.

 * Heavy snow helps Ukraine, Kazakhstan crops
 * Higher output unlikely to ease global shortage
 
 By Radu Marinas
 BUCHAREST, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Eastern Europe will probably
harvest more cereal crops this year as many farmers shift to
spring wheat after bad weather hit winter sowings, but it will
not be enough to ease tight global supplies.
 Heavy rains delayed sowings in most of ex-communist Europe
late last year, heightening worries about cereal yields while
timely precipitation in some ex-Soviet states may sharply boost
output there, analysts say.
 Grain experts said a surge in global wheat prices and
generally unfavourable weather in Europe could be a badly needed
incentive for cereal growers to increase planting areas.
 And swelling concerns about crops in the world's top
producing countries after adverse weather, including dryness in
the United States, coupled with ever rising demand are likely to
keep supporting global wheat prices in 2011.
 ""High prices and unfavourable weather conditions that
affected winter sowings are likely to encourage Polish farmers
to increase the area for sowings in spring,"" said Izabela
Dabrowska-Kasiewicz, analyst at BGZ in Warsaw.
 The increase is however unlikely to be substantial as crop
rotation and the generally poor quality of soil in Poland work
as natural limitations. Wieslaw Lopaciuk, analyst the Institute
of Agricultural and Food Economics, expects a 2-3 percent rise.
 Polish farm minister Marek Sawicki sees grain output picking
up from 2010 when it fell 8.5 percent on the year to 27 million
tonnes. Poland reaped 9.5 million tonnes of wheat last year.
 
 UKRAINE/KAZAKHSTAN EYE GOOD CROPS
 Further east, ex-Soviet Ukraine and Kazakhstan eye sharper
rises in their grain harvests helped by timely heavy snowfalls.
 Ukrainian forecasters predict 2011 grain crops will exceed
last year's level of 39 million tonnes, aided also by the
absence of severe winter frost.
 ""The conditions are perfect. The outlook for this year's
harvest is very good. Rains and snow are compensating for last
year's drought,"" Tetyana Adamenko, from the Ukrainian
government's weather forecasting service, told Reuters.
 UkrAgroConsult agriculture consultancy said Ukraine was
likely to boost its grain harvest to 46.2 million tonnes with
winter wheat rising to 20.2 million tonnes from 16.5 in 2010.
 Heavy snow cover in Kazakhstan in December had replenished
low moisture reserves in the autumn, said Sagintai Zhumazhanov,
head of the farm ministry's agrotechnology policy unit.
 The Central Asian state expects its harvest to recover to
15-16 million tonnes this year from 12.2 million tonnes in 2010,
although that would be well short of the record 20.8 million
harvested in 2009.
 ""If we use moisture-saving technology and fertilisers in the
same way, if we work the land well and the weather is good,
there's every chance we will harvest a crop no smaller than last
year's,"" a farming source told Reuters.
 
 LIMITED IMPACT
 European milling wheat futures almost doubled in 2010 after
a wave of weather events including severe drought in Russia and
floods in Australia and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
had said food prices may rise more on erratic weather patterns.
 Bigger harvests in Eastern Europe and Kazakhstan will not
offset smaller harvests elsewhere, however.
 ""These countries cannot offset the shortfall and have a
sizeable impact on global supply given concerns about crops in
Russia, United States and Australia,"" analyst Carsten Fritsch of
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt told Reuters.
 ""Wheat stocks in Europe are quite low already.""
 The International Grains Council had said that in the
European Union, the all-wheat area should increase by 1 percent
to 26.2 million hectares, slightly less than previously forecast
due to adversely wet conditions in south-eastern member states.
 The EU's smaller grain growers Romania and Bulgaria -- which
sowed slightly less acreage in the autumn and did not make
predictions on this year's harvest -- are expected to face crop
diseases because of a warm winter, which may harm quality.
 Bulgarian farmers have managed to make up for delays in
autumn sowings and now the area put under wheat is just 1
million ha or 1 percent less than a year ago, said Radoslav
Hristov, chairman of National Association of Grain Producers.
 Northern neighbour Romania failed to meet its plan to sow
2.1 million ha and stopped fieldwork at 1.9 million ha.
 ""Sowings prolonged until late December. Farmers will for
sure increase spring sowing but this may be limited to 20,000
hectares as many would want to shift focus to much productive
maize crops.""
 In Hungary, latest data showed standing water was covering
75,000 hectares of about 1 million planted with autumn wheat.
Tamas Petohazi, managing secretary at the Association of
Hungarian Grain Growers, said it was too early to give any
estimate for the wheat crop but that farmers were likely to
increase sunflower and maize sowing in the spring.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the
dollar on Thursday on persistent demand from sovereign accounts,
while investors gave euro zone officials time to make progress
on finding a sustainable solution to its debt crisis.
 The single currency recovered from an early slide, shaking
off European share price falls, with traders saying Mideast and
Asian central banks were buying around the day's low, pushing it
back towards a two-month high hit the previous day.
 Analysts said investors were optimistic the European Union's
rescue fund (EFSF) will ultimately offer a comprehensive
solution to help euro zone countries finance mounting debts.
 ""There's improved sentiment for the euro in that the market
seems to want to give the EU time to come up with a more
comprehensive deal to sort out the peripheral debt issue,"" said
Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 The Financial Times Deutschland on Thursday said euro area
finance ministers had discussed a plan to ease pressure on
Greece by allowing it buy back its own debt using credits from
the EFSF.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3520, hitting the day's high
after Morgan Stanley Q4 earnings per share came in above
expectations. It hovered near a two-month high hit on Wednesday
of $1.3539.
 ""The markets remain fairly calm and are giving the euro zone
authorities the benefit of the doubt for now, buying the euro on
the back of its favourable yield differential relative to the
dollar,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at FOREX.com. 
 Key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rates rose on Thursday,
as markets continued to digest last week's inflation warning
from the European Central Bank, lending support to the euro.
 Technical analysts said the single currency would be
supported around $1.3435, its 100-day moving average, while
upward resistance was seen at $1.3570, the 50 percent
retracement of the euro's November-to-January slide.
 European stock markets took a cue from selling in Asian
equities, after data showing stellar economic growth in China in
2010 fuelled speculation that Beijing may come under more
pressure to tighten monetary policy.
 Analysts said risk appetite was tempered investors waited to
see how a visit by Chinese President Hu Jintao to the United
States may affect Beijing's policy of holding down the value of
the yuan.
 Higher-yielding currencies including the AustralianZealand
dollars were the day's biggest losers, falling 0.6 percent and
0.8 percent versus the dollar respectively.
 The Australian dollar is particularly sensitive to the
performance of the Chinese economy as Australia is a major
supplier of natural resources to the country. Speculation of
higher Chinese rates tends to weaken the Aussie as such action
would cool growth, decreasing demand for resources.
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent versus a currency basket to
78.546, hovering near a two-month low of 78.303 hit on
Wednesday.
 ""The dollar-index is holding below pivotal support at 78.80
and that should keep it on the backfoot,"" said Friend at
nabCapital.
 Against the yen, the dollar was flat at 82.22 yen.

 By Nastya Lyrchikova
 MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Inter RAO could seek a strategic
investor for a 25 percent stake and may also consider share
swaps as it continues to grow, the Russian state-controlled
group's head Boris Kovalchuk said on Thursday.
 The electricity generator and power trader is being used by
Russia as a home for billions of dollars of assets as the
government seeks to create a consolidated power generation giant
with ambitious plans abroad.
 Inter RAO, which boasts influential deputy prime minister
Igor Sechin as head of its board, said last month it would raise
cash via a rights issue to buy the assets worth $9-15 billion.
 Earlier this week it said it will buy the British holding
company REDI, which owns a 49 percent stake in gas producer
Northgas, for $1.5 billion..
 Kovalchuk said in an update on the company's strategy the
group would consider selling a 25 percent stake by 2015.
 ""Inter RAO is interested in attracting a strategic investor,
for which we have set aside 25 percent of shares. It could be a
Russian energy or fuel company, it may be a foreign company that
could provide synergies,"" he told reporters.
 Grid company FSK and state-controlled RusHydro have already
been lined up to buy stakes of 17-20 percent and 6 percent
respectively.
 The move could be seen as part of a multi-billion dollar
privatisation programme of state assets set to kick off in
earnest this year. 
 Kovalchuk also said he would consider a share swap with
foreign companies -- a deal structure that would mirror the
agreement signed by Russia's biggest oil producer Rosneft and
British major BP late last week.
 
 TRANSFORMED
 Inter RAO's long term strategy was due an update following
the arrival of Russia's most powerful energy official Sechin as
head of the company's board.
 Sechin launched the consolidation of power assets under
Inter RAO and transformed the company from simple power trader
to international generation and distribution giant.
 ""Our aim is 40 gigawatt (GW) of installed capacity... About
75 percent of that (or 25-30 GW) we'll generate in Russia, and
10 GW abroad,"" Kovalchuk told the Kommersant newspaper earlier
on Thursday.
 Inter RAO's financial forecasts were for a tenfold increase
in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) to 2.8 billion euros ($3.77 billion) by 2015, up from
0.3 billion last year, Kovalchuk said.
 He added that 2011 revenues would likely be around 10
billion euros, rising to 23 billion in 2015.

 * Managed against new fundamentally weighted index
 
 By Chris Vellacott
 LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Swiss private bank Lombard Odier
is launching a fund investing in sub-investment grade bonds for
risk averse investors looking for ways to outpace rising
inflation without resorting to racy high yield credit.
 The fund is named ""Five B's"" because it invests in BBB and
BB rated European corporate bonds - so called ""fallen angels and
rising stars"" that are ineligible for investment grade funds and
unable to pay the returns demanded by high yield investors.
 Kevin Corrigan, head of credit at Lombard Odier's
investment management arm and manager of the fund said the
launch comes in response to interest expressed by private
clients but will also be marketed to institutional investors.
 ""With the push and pull of a pick up in global growth and at
the same time, structural indebted issues across Europe in
particular, what investors should be doing is looking at what we
think is the sweet spot ... between BBB and BB,"" he told
Reuters.
 Having suffered stiff losses to their wealth during the
financial crisis, investors are increasingly squeamish about
exposing their capital to the risk of further falls.
 But low interest rates alongside rising inflation is forcing
many to seek higher yields normally associated with riskier
investments.
 Lombard Odier hopes to capitalise on this pool of demand by
offering the fund that sits between two ends of the scale of
credit risk.
 The fund will be managed against an index developed by the
bank that assigns weightings according to a set of measures,
including a company's turnover, leverage and cash flow, unlike
traditional indexes focused on debt alone.

 TOKYO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The private banking arm of Societe
Generale in Japan aims to raise its assets by 10 percent this
year by expanding into the securities sector, the head of the
French bank's Japanese unit said.
 Societe Generale Private Banking Japan plans to boost its
workforce and increase the types of services it offers in a bid
to expand its client base in the world's second largest private
banking market after the United States.
 ""We are not going into the securities business to become a
broker,"" Christophe Billard, president and chief executive of
SocGen's Japanese unit, told reporters at a news conference on
Thursday, adding that the move would strengthen the service the
company offers its clients.
 Under Japanese law, private banks and trust banks need to get
regulatory permission to make recommendations on securities or to
solicit securities.
 ""We will not stop operating as a trust bank ... We are just
extending our offering ... to deliver securities services to
clients, so this could be advisory or it could be to provide
structured notes or structured securities services,"" Billard
said.
 SocGen aims to boost assets under management in its Japanese
private banking business by 10 percent this year from 474 billion
yen ($5.77 billion) as of December, he said.
 By 2015, the bank plans to raise assets under management by
40 percent to around 700 billion yen, he continued.
 The bank also wants to increase its client base in Japan by
20 percent from the current 1,400 households, which hold more
than 100 million yen in financial assets.
 The company aims to add 10 new staff, mainly private bankers
and front office workers, from the current 120 by the end of the
year.
 The Japanese unit of SocGen's private banking arm had 140
staff in 2009, but it has been adjusting its workforce in line
with market conditions, Billard said.

 * Russia seeks share of U.S. base fuel contract
 * Gazprom Neft says buying oil products duty free
 
 By Alla Afanasieva and Olga Dzyubenko
 MOSCOW/BISHKEK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Russia has removed a duty
on oil product exports to Kyrgyzstan, a telegram sent by its
customs service showed, in a move clearing the way for Moscow to
supply jet fuel to a U.S. air base key to its Afghan war effort.
 The export duty, introduced in April 2010, was annulled from
Jan. 1, according to a document sent by Russia's Federal Customs
Service to regional authorities and obtained by Reuters.
 The decision, which followed a meeting between Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin and his newly appointed Kyrgyz
counterpart, Almazbek Atambayev, signals a warming of ties after
quarrels over the U.S. military presence in the ex-Soviet state.
 ""There was a verbal agreement,"" a member of Kyrgyzstan's new
government said, on condition of anonymity.
 Kyrgyzstan has laid the foundation for Central Asia's first
parliamentary democracy, electing Atambayev as prime minister
after a year in which the president was overthrown and hundreds
killed in ethnic clashes.
 Former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, driven from power by a
popular revolt last April, had infuriated the Kremlin by
extending the U.S. lease on the Manas air base only months after
saying Washington should withdraw from the country.
 Russia also operates an air base in Kyrgyzstan.
 Fuel contracts with the Manas base, which adjoins the
international airport on the edge of the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek,
have been dogged by allegations of corruption ever since Bakiyev
was ousted.
 The United States awarded its latest fuel contract in
November to Gibraltar-registered Mina Corp, the same company
that supplied the Manas base under the Bakiyev administration.
Mina Corp has denied any links to Bakiyev or his family.
 But the latest contract includes a proviso that would allow
a Kyrgyz state entity to take over between 20 percent and 50
percent of volumes, cutting Mina Corp's share proportionately.
 
 STATE SUPPLIER
 Kyrgyzstan last month unveiled a new state company, Manas
Refuelling Complex, which could take over part of the contract,
possibly in partnership with a Russian firm.
 Valentin Vlasov, Russia's ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, said on
Dec. 8 that a unit of state-owned Gazprom Neft planned to team
up with the Kyrgyz state concern.
 Kyrgyzstan's Ministry for Economic Regulation said it had
not received any official notification of the duty's removal. An
official for Gazprom Neft Asia, the Russian firm's local unit,
also said he had not received official documentation.
 But Melis Turgunbayev, head of pricing at Gazprom Neft Asia,
told Reuters his company had received permission from customs
authorities to begin purchasing oil products at prices exclusive
of the tariff, which had been set at $217 per tonne in December.
 ""We concluded a contract last week. The volumes are without
the export duty and they should arrive here,"" he said.
 Jet fuel accounts for approximately one-third of Russia's
oil product exports to Kyrgyzstan. Russian traders said oil
product deliveries had fallen sharply as a result of the export
duty, but were likely to revive quickly after its removal.
 Gazprom Neft was the major Russian supplier to Kyrgyzstan
last year, sending more than 500,000 tonnes of oil products to
the Central Asian country. The company operates a network of
filling stations in Kyrgyzstan.
 In total, Kyrgyzstan received more than 900,000 tonnes of
different oil products from Russia in 2010, including more than
300,000 tonnes of jet fuel.
 Russia introduced duties on oil product exports to all CIS
countries outside its Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Traders said the telegram exempted only Kyrgyzstan.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Stronger-than-expected Chinese
growth data spurred concern on Thursday about tighter monetary
policy, prompting a sell-off in equities led by emerging
markets.
 Wall Street looked set to join in and open lower despite a
large jump in earnings from Morgan Stanley , the
second-largest U.S. investment bank.
The euro was slightly higher as speculation grew that the
euro zone's rescue mechanism for fiscally troubled peripheral
states might be strengthened.
 Chinese growth soared past forecasts and inflation slowed
less than expected in the fourth quarter, prompting worries the
government may intensify tightening.
 The potential for measures to slow Chinese growth ending up
as a hard landing is one of the major risks cited by investors
heading into 2011.
 ""A lot of Asian economies, and especially China, (are)
overheating. People have invested heavily in commodity shares
and any disappointing news might provoke a ... correction,"" said
Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets in Brussels.
 Emerging market stocks were the main victim, with MSCI's
benchmark index <.MSCIEF> losing more than 1.2 percent and
slipping into negative territory for the year.
 Overall, global stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>
lost 0.6 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down nearly
three-quarters of a percent, adding to 1.3 percent losses on
Wednesday. Mining stocks were among the biggest losers on the
assumption that demand for basic resources would fall if China's
growth is reined in.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed 1.1. percent lower.
 Overnight, the U.S. S&P 500 <.SPX> suffered its biggest
decline in nearly two months as Goldman Sachs  posted a 53
percent drop in profit on a tumble in trading revenue and Wells
Fargo  came in below some analysts' estimates.
 
 EURO EDGED UP
 The euro edged up against the dollar on persistent demand
from sovereign accounts and while investors gave euro zone
officials time to make progress on finding a sustainable
solution to its debt crisis.
 Traders said Mideast and Asian central banks were buying.
 Investors were generally optimistic the European Union's
rescue fund (EFSF) will ultimately offer a comprehensive
solution to help euro zone countries finance mounting debts. 
 ""The markets remain fairly calm and are giving the euro zone
authorities the benefit of the doubt for now, buying the euro on
the back of its favourable yield differential relative to the
dollar,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at FOREX.com.
 The single currency  was at $1.3485. It hit $1.3539
on Wednesday, its strongest since late November.
 The Financial Times Deutschland on Thursday said euro area
finance ministers had discussed a plan on Monday at a regular
meeting in Brussels to allow Athens to buy back its own debt
using credits from the euro zone's rescue fund. [ID:nLDE70J0CB]
 ""This has the potential to really get the uncertainty out of
the air ... but so far we just lack the facts which hinders
further (debt) spread tightening,"" said David Schnautz, rate
strategist at Commerzbank.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday as weaker global shares stifled appetite for
higher-risk currencies, prompting investors to book profits on
the single currency's rally to a two-month high.
 European shares were pressured lower, taking a cue from
weaker Asian markets after stellar economic growth in China in
2010 fuelled speculation that Beijing may come under more
pressure to tighten monetary policy.
 Lingering concerns about the effectiveness of an EU rescue
fund for euro zone countries struggling with debt problems also
helped to keep sentiment negative for the euro on Thursday.
 Analysts said risk demand had cooled as investors waited to
see how a visit by Chinese President Hu Jintao to the United
States may affect Beijing's policy of holding down the value of
the yuan.
""Global equities are on the weaker side, and the China/U.S.
talks are weighing on upwards risk sentiment,"" said Lutz
Karpowitz, currency analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 He added: ""There's still questions on the EFSF, and how to
help debt-ridden countries,"" saying that this would put downward
pressure on the euro in the mid-term.
 In early European trade, the euro slipped 0.2 percent on the
day to the day's low of $1.3420, retreating from $1.3539 hit on
Wednesday, its strongest since late November.
 It later trimmed losses to trade around $1.3470, unchanged
on the day.
 Technical analysts said the single currency would be
supported around $1.3435, its 100-day moving average, while
upward resistance was seen at $1.3570, the 50 percent
retracement of the euro's November to January slide,.
 Higher-yielding currencies including the AustralianZealand
dollars were the day's biggest losers, each falling around 0.7
percent versus the dollar.
 The Australian dollar is particularly sensitive to the
performance of the Chinese economy as Australia is a major
supplier of natural resources to the country. Speculation of
higher Chinese rates tends to weaken the Aussie as such action
would cool growth, decreasing demand for resources.

 LIMITED EURO LOSSES?
 Some in the market said euro losses may be limited for now,
as sovereign demand for the single currency was seen in the
lower $1.34 region.
 Market participants said investors remained long of dollars
despite the euro's rally in the past week or so, which resulted
in natural demand to sell dollars before the end of the month.
 Analysts added that a slide in U.S. Treasury yields was
helping to keep a lid on demand for the U.S. currency, and that
it could come under selling pressure in the near term.
 The U.S. dollar stabilised in the wake of its broad slide
the previous day. It held steady against a basket of currencies
at 78.685, but hovered in range of a two-month low of 78.303
struck on Wednesday.
 ""The dollar index broke through 79, a support level that has
held for over a month, which could signal the beginning of the
dollar's return to a medium to long-term down trend,"" JPMorgan
analysts said in a note.
 Against the yen, the dollar was flat at 82.11 yen.
 One trader said an option barrier at 83.00 yen could limit
the dollar's gains in the near-term. The existence of such a
barrier means options players are likely to sell the dollar if
it rises towards 83.00 yen.

(Adds Kan comments on maritime rows) 
 By Chisa Fujioka	
 TOKYO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Naoto Kan
renewed his commitment on Thursday to open up Japan's market to
capitalise on overseas growth and stuck to a June deadline to
decide whether to join a U.S.-led free trade initiative.	
 In a foreign policy speech, Kan also reaffirmed the
importance of the U.S. military presence in Japan given regional
tensions including over North Korea's nuclear programme.	
 While stressing the need for stronger relations with the
United States, he called for tighter ties with Asian neighbours
such as China but reiterated Japan's concern over China's
military build-up.	
 Kan has come under fire from domestic critics for not having
a coherent diplomatic strategy and mishandling territorial rows
with China and Russia. Ties with ally Washington frayed under
his predecessor due to a dispute over a U.S. Marines airbase.	
 On trade, Kan said he wanted to press ahead with studies
into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a U.S.-led free trade
initiative. Many Japanese businesses are keen to join the TPP,
but powerful farming lobbies have resisted.	
 ""When my cabinet was formed last June, I felt it was
necessary to restore an energetic Japan and to break a sense of
deadlock that has continued for nearly 20 years,"" he said in the
speech.	
 ""The key is to open up the country, both in terms of
thinking and of the economy.""	
 
 The TPP started as a trade pact between Singapore, New
Zealand, Chile and Brunei, who have since been joined in talks
by Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the United States.	
 Adding Japan's $5 trillion economy would greatly increase
the potential market-opening gains of the proposed pact.	
 But it could also complicate the negotiations, since Tokyo
would not only have to free up agriculture but address U.S.
concerns that planned postal system reforms will hurt private
competitors in the insurance, banking and express delivery
sectors.	
 Japan's previous trade deals have left out the heavily
protected farm sector, which holds considerable political clout
due to an electoral system that places a greater weight on rural
votes.	
 Kan expressed his concern about growing regional rows
over maritime resources, and said Japan is ready to play a key
role in keeping further disputes from occurring. 
 ""Waters in the Asia-Pacific area are the source of
wealth for the whole region. But it should not be overlooked
that disputes surrounding rights to maritime resources have
emerged in recent years as a destabilising factor,"" Kan
said. 
 ""We aim to play a leadership role in setting up new
maritime rules to prevent new disputes and keep the waters in
the region as the ocean of peace."" 
 China has warned its neighbours to stay off disputed
islands in the South China Sea, declaring it holds ""indisputable
sovereignty"" over the waters. 
 Sino-Japanese relations
deteriorated sharply after September, when Japan detained a
Chinese skipper whose trawler collided with Japanese patrol
boats near a chain of disputed islands in the East China Sea,
called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. 
 The inhabited islands are thought to lie near potential
oil and gas reserves in an area rich with fish.

 By Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on
profit taking on Thursday, after having extended its rally to a
two-month high above $1.35 overnight, bringing a key technical
level in focus that could throw a speed-bump in its path.
 Disappointing earnings from Goldman Sachs  and weak
U.S. housing data on Wednesday hit appetite for riskier assets,
giving traders an excuse to book profits on the euro.
 ""The euro has actually had quite a strong move since the
beginning of the year... So it's time for a pause and fall
before it trades higher,"" said a trader for a European bank in
Hong Kong.
 The euro eased 0.1 percent from late U.S. trading on
Wednesday to $1.3459 .
 On Wednesday the euro had risen to its highest in about two
months of $1.3539 on trading platform EBS, helped by talk of
euro buying by Asian central banks and short-covering.
 A breach of that peak would bring resistance near $1.3570 in
view, the 50 percent retracement of the euro's November to
January slide.
 ""The market is not that short euros now, and there are even
a few hot-money longs put on in the last 12-24 hours, but the
sentiment still seems strong enough. To me the market mentality
has shifted to buy on dips. For now, anything towards $1.34
should attract bids,"" said a trader at a U.S. investment bank.
 Solid bond auctions in Spain and Portugal have eased worries
about the euro zone debt crisis, and talk that German officials
were drafting contingency plans in case Greece defaults
suggested they were working to prevent the crisis from
worsening. [nLDE70I158]
 ""If we can trade through $1.3500 and hold that, I can see it
trading up to $1.3750,"" said the trader for a European bank in
Hong Kong. Such a rise could occur in the next month, he said.
 Resistance levels clustered around $1.3750 include $1.3739,
a 61.8 percent retracement of the euro's November to January
slide, as well as $1.3786, the euro's Nov. 22 intraday high.
 Also on the retreat, the Australian dollar  fell 0.5
percent to $0.9955 , with one trader citing
profit-taking by macro funds.
 The Australian dollar briefly pared some of its losses after
the official release of Chinese data confirmed that China's
consumer inflation eased in December from a 28-month high in
November. [ID:nTOE70I026]
 The consumer inflation data was in line with figures leaked
by Hong Kong media on Wednesday.
 The easing of inflation could help lessen the urgency for
further immediate tightening measures by China and lend support
to risk appetite and the Australian dollar.
 The U.S. dollar stabilised in the wake of its broad slide
the previous day. It held steady against a basket of currencies
at 78.669 <.DXY>, up from a two-month low of 78.303 struck on
Wednesday.
 Against the yen, the dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 82.12
yen .
 One trader said an option barrier at 83.00 yen could limit
the dollar's gains in the near-term. The existence of such a
barrier means options players are likely to sell the dollar if
it rises towards 83.00 yen.

(Adds Hu speech)
 By Thomas Ferraro and Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers pressed
Chinese President Hu Jintao to get tough on North Korea and
improve human rights on Thursday but trod more softly on the
currency dispute that is a major irritant between the world's
top two economies.
 Hu was urged by President Barack Obama on Wednesday to let
the value of China's currency rise but members of Congress
zeroed in on human rights and trade to underscore the huge gaps
between Beijing and Washington.
 ""Chinese leaders have a responsibility to do better and the
United States has a responsibility to hold them to account,""
John Boehner, the new Republican speaker of the House of
Representatives, said after meeting Hu with other lawmakers.
 Analysts have called Hu's visit to Washington the most
significant by a Chinese leader in 30 years given China's
growing military and diplomatic clout.
 But it comes at a time of strains over everything from
economic policy and climate change to the nuclear ambitions of
North Korea and Iran.
 Lawmakers said they urged Hu to take a stronger line on
North Korea, hoping to use Beijing's influence over Pyongyang
to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula and resume
aid-for-disarmament talks.
 After a series of business deals were announced this week,
Hu continued his courtship of U.S. companies with a speech
describing the benefits of cooperation before he was due to
travel to Chicago on Thursday afternoon. More deals are
expected to be announced there.
 Underlining China's importance to the global economy, data
on Thursday showed its annual growth quickened in the fourth
quarter of last year to 9.8 percent, defying expectations of a
slowdown.
 ""SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERVALUED""
 As U.S. voter anger simmers with unemployment riding above
9 percent, lawmakers have threatened new tariffs to punish
Beijing for policies that critics say undervalue the yuan by up
to 40 percent against the dollar.
 The policies make China's exports artificially cheap, the
critics charge, and contribute to a trade gap that Washington
puts at $270 billion.
 While House lawmakers skipped the currency question, which
has been raised more frequently in the past by Democrats than
Republicans, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid did raise it in
his meeting with Hu, an aide said.
 And the U.S. Treasury kept up the pressure with Assistant
Treasury Secretary Charles Collyns saying Beijing has kept the
yuan ""substantially undervalued.""
 Obama had spoken forcefully about the yuan in a joint news
conference with Hu on Wednesday but the comments by Collyns
were the sharpest direct criticism of China's currency policies
during Hu's visit.
 Rick Larsen, the Democratic co-chairman of the bipartisan
U.S.-China Working Group in the House, said China must get
serious about improving U.S. access to its huge domestic market
and allowing the yuan to rise.
 ""This puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage and unfairly
tilts the playing field toward domestic Chinese companies,"" he
said in a statement on Thursday.
 State media in China lapped up the pomp of the visit but
largely avoided mention of the rare news conference by the two
presidents, where Hu was peppered with questions about the yuan
and human rights.
 Beijing residents said BBC and CNN broadcasts of the summit
went blank when questions moved to human rights and
anti-Chinese protesters, although access to foreign news
channels is limited to upscale hotels and apartment complexes.
 Newspapers splashed photos of Hu with Obama across their
front pages, with headlines touting a ""new chapter in
relations"" after China agreed to buy $45 billion worth of U.S.
goods in deals that seemed aimed at quelling anti-Chinese
sentiment in the United States.
 Hu told the U.S.-China Business Council on Thursday that
cheap Chinese exports had saved American consumers $600 billion
over the past decade and described hopes for a richer
partnership -- while avoiding mention of human rights or the
currency issue.
 ""Our two countries have never enjoyed such broad common
interests and shouldered such broad common responsibilities as
they do today,"" Hu said, adding that China ""will unwaveringly
take the path of peaceful development.""
 YUAN NOT TO BLAME
 Neither Boehner nor Reid attended Wednesday's White House
dinner for Hu, labeled ""a dictator"" by the Senate majority
leader in a television interview this week. Senate Republican
leader Mitch McConnell skipped the Hu visit entirely.
 Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential
candidate, and former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi led
the effort to put pressure on Hu over human rights in their
meetings, congressional aides said, illustrating the bipartisan
nature of concern over China's record.
 Small groups of rights activists continued to demonstrate
near Hu's Washington hotel on Thursday while a larger number of
China supporters gathered nearby to shout counter-slogans.
 Democratic Representative Howard Berman said it was
frustrating that issues such as currency could not be covered
in Thursday's meeting between House members and Hu.
 ""Many of us never got a chance to raise issues because of
the limited time,"" he said. ""Life is full of frustrations.""
 In the past week, China's central bank has repeatedly set
the daily mid-point for the yuan at record highs in keeping
with a policy of strengthening the currency during important
diplomatic events.
 But China has thus far resisted demands for faster
appreciation of the yuan.
 Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said Beijing's position
on the exchange rate ""has not substantially changed"" while
Commerce Minister Chen Deming said China wanted to resolve the
trade imbalance through talks and the value of the yuan was not
to blame, the official Xinhua news agency said.
 Analysts said the U.S.-China business pacts agreed during
the visit looked impressive but some agreements may take years
to materialize and others were closer to non-binding draft
deals that still require further negotiations -- leaving the
real results of the visit unclear.

 By Aileen Wang and Kevin Yao	
 BEIJING, Jan 20 (Reuters) - China finished 2010 with a bang,
its growth soaring past forecasts and inflation slowing less
than expected, numbers that could prod the government to
intensify its easy-does-it approach to tightening.	
 Evidence of robust growth may give officials confidence to
take more aggressive steps to quell price pressures, from
stricter lending curbs to interest rate rises, as rising food
costs in recent weeks suggest inflation will rebound in coming
months.	
 China's annual gross domestic product growth sped up in the
fourth quarter to 9.8 percent from 9.6 percent in the third
quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on
Thursday, defying expectations for a slowdown to 9.2 percent.	
 ""Inflation pressure is intensifying into January and the
tightening pressure will intensify, especially considering the
stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP growth,"" said Isaac
Meng, economist with BNP Paribas in Beijing.	
 Full-year growth picked up to 10.3 percent from 9.2 percent
in 2009.	
 With President Hu Jintao on a state visit to the United
States, the figures served as a powerful reminder that despite
controversy about China's vast trade surplus, its economy is far
from dependent on exports.	
 Domestic investment and consumption contributed 9.5
percentage points to its growth last year, while net exports
added just 0.8 percentage point.

 POLL-China's growth, inflation in 2011 
 ANALYSIS: China's ritual lending headache 
 
 Consumer prices in December rose 4.6 percent from a year
earlier, slowing from a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November
but staying above forecasts for a steeper fall to 4.4 percent.	
 Other important data for December, from factory output to
investment, painted a picture of stable expansion, showing that
the world's second-largest economy was not overheating despite
the surprise jump in growth.	
 Although the growth and inflation figures had been published
in advance by local media, China's main stock index shed
2.9 percent as investors viewed the strong set of data as
bolstering the case for tightening.	
 
 MORE TIGHTENING NEEDED	
 China has officially raised banks' required reserves seven
times since the start of last year, with its most recent
increase taking effect on Thursday.	
 But it has increased interest rates only twice during that
time and some analysts warn that more forceful moves are needed.	
 The government is still debating the extent of credit curbs,
and reports in recent days have pointed to Beijing imposing a
lower ceiling on bank lending than some investors had expected.	
 ""Beijing still has more work to do to keep the economy on an
even keel,"" said Brian Jackson, an economist with Royal Bank of
Canada in Hong Kong. ""Risks are skewed to more aggressive
action.""	
 A Reuters poll showed that economists expect two interest
rate rises in the first half of 2011. 
 To keep banks from skirting restrictions on credit growth,
the Chinese banking regulator said on Thursday that lenders must
bring all of their off-balance-sheet loans sold to trusts back
onto their books this year. 
 In a sign that the various stabs at tightening are starting
to bite, China's benchmark short-term money market rate spiked
194 basis points on Thursday, heading for its biggest single-day
rise on record as the latest required reserves increase took
effect. 
 To ease the tight market liquidity, the central bank
conducted reverse repurchase agreements with selected banks,
sources told Reuters. 
 
 INFLATION WORRY	
 Weekly food price movements had long pointed to a decline in
inflationary pressure in December, but many analysts also
reckoned that any slowdown in inflation could be temporary.	
 December's data showed a clear slackening in price pressures
as monthly inflation eased to 0.5 percent from 1.1 percent in
November.	
 A drop in food price inflation to an annual rate of 9.6
percent in December from 11.7 percent in November was the main
reason for the decline.	
 But price pressures could pick up in January, because harsh
winter weather could compound a surge in demand with the Lunar
New Year holiday falling earlier in the calendar this year than
in 2010.	
 Indeed, food price data compiled by the commerce ministry
shows vegetables and meat have become more expensive since the
start of the year.	
 ""Growth momentum remains strong. However, inflation is the
key focus of the market. It will be a challenging year for China
to battle inflation,"" said Dongming Xie, China economist at OCBC
Bank in Singapore.	
 Currency appreciation is another potential tool in Beijing's
tightening kit.	
 It has nudged the yuan higher against the dollar over the
past week, but dealers see the mini-burst of appreciation as
politically motivated to try to soften U.S. criticism of China's
currency policy during Hu's state visit. 
 Analysts expect appreciation of just 5 percent this year,
with Hu himself saying that inflation was hardly the most
important factor in determining the exchange rate.	
 Ma Jiantang, chief of China's statistics agency, said he was
confident that China would be able to control inflation in 2011
and that steps to limit the amount of cash in the economy would
be instrumental to taming price pressures.	
 Economists polled by Reuters forecast that Chinese consumer
price inflation will average 4.3 percent this year, above the
government's target of capping it at 4 percent.	
 Economic growth is expected to slow to 9.3 percent in 2011
from 10.3 percent last year.
